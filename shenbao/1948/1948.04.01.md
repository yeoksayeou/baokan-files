### Vandenberg Strongly Advocates Supporting Our Country, US Senate Passes Aid to China Bill, Shanghai Circles Urge US Congress to Approve Quickly

[United States News Agency, Washington, 30th] Today, the Senate passed legislation to aid China with $463 million over one year through a voice vote. This action was taken after Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vandenberg urged passage of the bill. Vandenberg hopes that by the end of this weekend, a final resolution can be reached on the disagreements between the Senate and House versions of the various foreign aid bills.

[Another Telegram] When the Senate passed the aid to China bill today, Vandenberg delivered a speech in the Senate, stating in brief: "During World War II, China was one of the countries that suffered the most significant blows. In this great war, China was always our loyal ally against the Axis powers, bearing the brunt of Japan's attacks and occupation, but always refusing any separate peace opportunities. However, the victory over the Axis powers has not ended China's dangers. The fruits of victory have not benefited China. China is still suffering from civil war, and its government is constantly attacked by armed Communists, becoming a victim of aggressive conspiracies that undermine world peace.

"It is not surprising that China is on the brink of danger under all these significant burdens and accumulated difficulties. What is surprising is that all the crises have failed to break China's courageous spirit to continue its efforts. We must frankly admit the urgency of the current situation. But in my opinion, if we do not make every effort to support and encourage the Chinese government and the Chinese people to resist aggression and maintain independence at this time, we will be disloyal to our own goals."

[This City News] Speaker Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Council, along with leaders from all sectors of Shanghai, sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart on the 29th of last month, requesting him to forward it to the leaders of the US Congress and all its members, urging the passage of the $463 million aid to China bill to prevent the Red invasion. The telegram was led by Speaker Pan and signed by university presidents and others.

[United Press, Washington, 31st] Democratic Senator Magnuson proposed in the Senate today that at least 75 percent of the wheat shipped under the China Relief Act should be flour. It is claimed that currently, 65 percent of the wheat shipped from the Pacific Northwest to China is wheat rather than flour. This move will make bran used for copper scarce and expensive, thereby reducing milk and poultry production.

### Second Preparatory Meeting of the National Assembly Passes Amendments to Organizational Law, Transferred to the National Government for Submission to the Legislative Yuan for Discussion

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The first and second preparatory meetings of the National Assembly were held at 9:20 AM on the 31st, with Hu Shih continuing to serve as temporary chairman. After the secretariat read the minutes of the first preparatory meeting, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported on the key points of the oral and written opinions expressed by various representatives at the first preparatory meeting regarding the method of electing the presidium. These key points were divided into five parts: the first part advocated increasing the number of members in the presidium; the second part advocated maintaining the original proposal; the third part concerned the number of members to be added; the fourth part concerned the method of election; and the fifth part concerned the quota for women. After Hong's report, temporary chairman Hu Shih proposed that the issue of whether to amend the National Assembly Organizational Law should be discussed first, and new opinions could also be put forward. From 10:30 AM to 10:50 AM, the atmosphere in the meeting hall reached its highest point of contention, and after 10:45 AM, it entered the voting stage. The new opinions put forward by the representatives today can be summarized into the following points: (1) According to the provisions of the National Assembly Organizational Law, 25 members are to be elected to the presidium, and a special committee is to be established, with one member from each unit serving as a committee member to assist the presidium in handling administrative matters. Members of the special committee may attend presidium meetings. (2) The original draft should be maintained in the text, but it should be evenly distributed, and a proviso should be added at the end of the article, restricting the number of incumbent officials elected to the presidium. (3) The Constitution should be followed, and the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly has no right to amend any rules. Therefore, the presidium must be elected immediately before discussion. Moreover, if we immediately propose to the Legislative Yuan to amend the National Assembly Organizational Law, the Legislative Yuan may not be able to start working immediately, which will cause delays in time. (4) The quota for women should account for 20 percent of the total. Among the above points of view, the explanation of the third point is the proposition of incumbent legislator Lin Bin. His emphasis on observing the spirit of the Constitution and not having the right to amend the Organizational Law is based on legal principles, but it did not receive the sympathy of the majority at the time. It was then put to a vote. First, the motion to maintain the original plan was put to a vote, followed by a negative vote. As a result, the majority agreed to the amendment. Representative Wang Chonghui then proposed that the National Assembly Organizational Law be transferred to the National Government to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for the rapid completion of the legislative procedure for amendment, while the assembly would continue the nomination and election procedures. The opinions of the representatives on the number of people were all attached as annexes and transferred to the National Government for reference by the Legislative Yuan. Someone also suggested that if the Legislative Yuan amends the clauses of the case, it must not make rigid regulations, but only use "a certain number of people" as a flexible regulation, which was passed together. The nomination and election of the presidium could not be discussed due to time constraints.

### Legislative Yuan to Meet and Discuss Within Days

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The case decided by the second preparatory meeting of the National Assembly to transfer the National Assembly Organizational Law to the National Government for submission to the Legislative Yuan to amend the clauses and complete the legislative procedure was compiled by the Secretariat of the National Assembly on the 31st and submitted to the National Government at 4 PM. It is also heard that the Legislative Yuan will convene a general assembly within days to discuss this case.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Lou Tongsun, Acting Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, told this newspaper's reporter on the 31st noon, after learning that the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly had passed a resolution requesting the National Government to order the Legislative Yuan to amend the National Assembly Organizational Law (regarding the number of chairmen in the National Assembly Presidium) as soon as possible, that if the Legislative Yuan receives the order from the National Government, it will convene a temporary meeting in the shortest possible time to discuss and decide on this issue.

### Third Preparatory Meeting Today to Discuss Representative Seats

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The third preparatory meeting of the National Assembly is scheduled to be held at 9 AM on the 1st, with Chairman Yu Bin.

### Ju Zheng Decides to Run for President, Advocates Laissez-Faire Governance and Stability First, and Supports Yu Youren for Vice President

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] As the capital is filled with an atmosphere of competition for the vice presidency, and Chairman Chiang is still about to announce that he will participate in the presidential election, President Ju Zheng declared to this newspaper's reporter one afternoon: He has decided to run for this year's presidency, but he said in an extremely humble tone: "This is just a matter of accompanying the election. I still hope that Chairman Chiang will be elected." When the reporter asked about his campaign platform and political views, Ju avoided answering. After repeated inquiries, Ju finally said: "I have always advocated laissez-faire governance. Recently, I gave a speech in Taiwan on 'Seeking Construction in Stability,' which can be regarded as my campaign platform and political views. According to the Constitution, the president is only the head of state, so the president actually has not much to do. It is best to adopt laissez-faire governance. At present, the bandit disaster is in full swing, and with the destruction of the Communist bandits, all construction is out of the question. My current advocacy is still 'stability first,' first suppressing the rebellion to seek stability, and then seeking construction in stability." When the reporter asked that everyone has been calling for the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the vice presidential candidates are also using the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood as a slogan, what are the president's opinions on this? Ju replied: "It is only right to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, but it is too late to implement it now, even saying it is too late. We have been carrying out the revolution for decades, what have we done in the past? Only now do we think of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood!" When talking about the tasks of this year's National Assembly, Ju said that this year's National Assembly should be limited to electing the president and vice president. It is best not to amend the Constitution, because whether the Constitution is good or bad, it is not yet known without implementation. It can only be decided whether it needs to be amended after implementation. The reporter asked him which of the four vice presidential candidates he would support. Ju replied: "I will support Mr. Yu."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee held a temporary meeting this afternoon and decided to establish a "Support Sun Vice-Chairman's Campaign for Vice President Campaign Team."

### Statement by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense: National Army's Strategic Actions Emphasize Concentrating Forces, Longkou, Penglai, and Weihaiwei Will All Be Abandoned

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense recently issued a statement on the National Army's future strategic actions, stating: (1) At present, in the Jiaodong area, because the National Army already has the cooperation of the navy and air force to monitor the Bohai Sea surface, especially the Changshan Islands outside Longkou and Penglai and Liugong Island outside Weihaiwei, all are under the control of the National Army. Therefore, Longkou, Penglai, Weihaiwei, and other places that have lost their military value will be abandoned so that the army can concentrate its forces to attack the main force of the bandits and launch mobile attacks. (2) The National Army's successful withdrawal strategy from Yongji in the Northeast has proven that concentrating forces can seize the initiative. Therefore, secondary strongholds without military strategic value will still be abandoned when necessary in the future.

### Two Mornings, One Resolution

Special Dispatch from This Newspaper - (March 31st in Nanjing)

The convocation of the National Assembly is originally a test of public opinion, and democratic politics requires even longer efforts to learn lessons from past mistakes and move towards progress. Hu Shih was "drafted" again today to sit in the position of temporary chairman. When he was troubled by the voting machine dispute, he said: "I learned a lesson today. In the future, whoever is chairman must remember to test the voting machine before using it." This is progress. Looking at the meeting from this point of view, the one resolution barely obtained in two mornings is just one of many experiences.

On the morning of the 31st, the entire meeting hall was filled with shouts. Speakers were vying for the floor, and the order gradually became chaotic, making it difficult for Principal Hu to control. Originally, this second preparatory meeting was to invite Representative Yu Youren to serve as temporary chairman. Before the meeting, President Yu came and then left, and Yu Bin was nominated instead. However, the bishop could not be found in the meeting hall, so Hu Shih had to be pulled in again as a temporary chairman. Today's meeting continued yesterday's agenda to discuss the method of electing the presidium. Originally, the secretariat's summary of yesterday's opinions was already very complete, but today, more branches were born. In addition to someone shouting loudly for the signing representatives on hunger strike, even the voting machine—the most scientific tool—became the object of discussion and the target of suspicion. Hu Shih had indeed done his best, and he had shown it at least three times. The first time was when he announced a ten-minute break when the emotions of the audience were agitated, which eased the situation. The second time was to respect the result of the negative vote, even though the negative vote did not necessarily represent the majority, it also calmed everyone's emotions. The third time was after passing the motion to comfort the representatives on hunger strike, someone still wanted to speak. Chairman Hu cut the Gordian knot and announced "adjournment," and the representatives stood up one after another, and no one could speak anymore.

The smooth completion of the resolution should be attributed to one report and one proposal. Hong Lanyou was ordered to read the secretariat's summary of the results of the opinions of the representatives yesterday. The reasoning was clear, and all the main opinions were included. There were no new opinions from speakers after that. Wang Chonghui proposed that the National Assembly Organizational Law be sent to the National Government to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for amendment, while the election of the presidium should be carried out to quickly enter the agenda and save time, which became the basis for discussion. After the report and before the proposal, Chairman Hu Shih first voted on (1) maintaining the original method, (2) deciding to amend the election method, and (3) another suggestion that the presidium should still have 25 members, and a special committee should be established, with one representative from each unit participating and attending the presidium. However, the vote caused unexpected disputes.

Before and after the vote, many representatives strove to speak, but there were few new opinions, so there were shouts everywhere. Lin Bin took the stage to speak, and his opinion was quite valuable. He said: We should abide by the Constitution. Without solving the issue of the presidium, we cannot hold the National Assembly, and the decision of the preparatory meeting cannot amend any laws. We only need to elect the presidium and hold the National Assembly, and there will be plenty of opportunities to amend it later. But his words were too long, and he was shouted down in the agitated emotions. Female representative Zhang Sheng called for increasing the proportion of women in the presidium to 20 percent, which received sympathetic applause. At this time, the vote was finally taken. Hu Shih first voted on maintaining the original method. The light on the voting machine turned on, and a total of 933 people agreed. There were 1,862 representatives in the hall, a majority. Among those who advocated amendment, some expressed doubts about the voting machine, shouting "fake," which frightened the lady in charge of the voting machine from turning off the machine. Hu Shih announced that representatives could be sent to inspect it, but no one went. Hu Shih had to do a reverse vote, and as a result, 981 people agreed to the amendment. Adding the opinions of both sides together exceeded the number of representatives in the hall. Obviously, someone had flipped the voting machine twice. At this time, the meeting hall became even more chaotic. Hu Shih said: Someone must be curious, so they flipped it twice. In order to calm the meeting hall, he announced a ten-minute break.

When the meeting continued, the emotions were much calmer. Hu Shih announced that he respected the majority opinion of the reverse vote and passed the amendment. At the same time, he put forward the proposal of representatives such as Wang Chongzhuan. Several representatives continued to speak, advocating paying attention to the participation of representatives of border ethnic minorities in the presidium, and that the number of members in the presidium should not be rigidly stipulated, etc. At this time, a resolution was finally formulated after two mornings, sending the National Assembly Organizational Law to the National Government to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for rapid amendment, and attaching the opinions of the representatives of the two conferences as a reference for the amendment. Wang Chonghui also proposed to immediately proceed with the election of the presidium, but due to time constraints, he had to wait until tomorrow to say.

When the discussion came to comforting the signing representatives on hunger strike, although it was also noisy and there were constant boos, there were also some opinions, but Hu Shih's opinion was successfully passed. Hu Shih said, please authorize the chairman of this conference to appoint five to ten people from the proposed representatives to visit, comfort, and advise them to eat, pending a government solution. Ma Wen called out, comforting them at the same time as solving the problem. Someone booed him, so there was no follow-up. Hu Shih said, this is not something we can solve.

The second preparatory meeting was quickly adjourned. Hopefully tomorrow's "democracy lesson" will have even more progress.

### Reinforcements Arrive in Fuyang, Communist Bandits Suffer Setbacks and Retreat Slightly

### Suzhou to Lift Martial Law Starting Today

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 31st] The Suzhou City Defense Command announced on the 31st that temporary martial law would be lifted from April 1st and night travel would be unimpeded because the National Assembly has been successfully convened, the local police stations are tight, and the bandits cannot succeed.

### Editorial: On Italy's April Elections

The Italian parliament is scheduled to hold re-elections on April 18th. With only a dozen days remaining, the competition between the left and right-wing parties within Italy has reached a fever pitch. Furthermore, the "Cold War" being waged by the two major international blocs has shifted its focus to the Italian peninsula. In recent days, the world's attention has been concentrated on Italy's April 18th election. When the Italian authorities decided on the date for the parliamentary re-election, the international community was already rife with alarming rumors. These rumors included claims that the Soviet Union was attempting to infiltrate the Italian peninsula with its communist forces, and that the Italian Communist Party was exceptionally active domestically and confident of winning the upcoming general election. This caused countries around the world to closely monitor the future development of the Italian political situation. The outcome of the Italian general election will not only determine Italy's fate but also influence the entire European situation. To prevent the intrusion of communist forces into the Italian peninsula, the United States, initially through a speech by Secretary of State Marshall, issued a serious verbal warning to the Italian Communist Party. It stated that if the Italian Communist Party controlled the Italian government, it would be clear evidence of Italy's withdrawal from the European Recovery Program, and the United States would no longer provide economic assistance. Subsequently, the United States, along with Britain and France, issued a joint statement proposing amendments to the Italian peace treaty, advocating for the return of the port of Trieste to Italy. The United States' diplomatic offensive, employing both hard and soft tactics towards Italy, has a clear purpose: to win over the hearts of the Italian people. This will likely have a significant impact, potentially even influencing the outcome of the April general election. However, on the other hand, it has also triggered serious repercussions.

Firstly, the Soviet Union will not remain "indifferent" to this diplomatic offensive by the United States. The Soviet representative's withdrawal from the Allied Control Council for Berlin is a powerful "counterattack" by the Soviet Union in the "Cold War." In the future, there will be endless intellectual and strategic battles on the diplomatic front. Secondly, Yugoslavia, due to its close relationship, had its Foreign Minister, Mr. Mikunovic, issue a strong protest to Britain, the United States, and France, immediately increasing the tension in the Trieste region. Yugoslavian army patrol teams briefly intruded into the Anglo-American defense zone of Trieste, resulting in clashes with local police. Although this was a small-scale incident, who can guarantee that it will not escalate? Britain and the United States have deployed large numbers of reinforcements to strengthen their defenses. Simultaneously, on the diplomatic front, Yugoslavia has demanded direct negotiations with Italy, seeking the Italian port of Gorizia as a condition for returning Trieste to Italy. However, the Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman has stated a firm rejection. Therefore, the Italian peninsula has, in fact, become a "battlefield" of the "Cold War," and it has reached a critical stage. The outcome of this general election is a decisive factor for the European situation and even for the peace of the entire world!

Since the Czech coup established a communist regime, Europe seems to have a clear dividing line, separating it into Eastern and Western Europe. The treaty of the Western European Union has also been signed and established in Paris. However, whether the Western European Union can achieve its intended goals and play its greatest role depends heavily on Italy's participation. Therefore, from the perspective of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, they must firmly pull Italy into expanding the scope of the Western European Union. Furthermore, the Italian peninsula is strategically located, extending into the Mediterranean Sea. From a military perspective, the United States will never allow communist forces to intrude into Italy. Moreover, after the Italian general election in April, France will also hold its general election in May. The outcome of the Italian general election will directly affect the French general election. Therefore, the United States does not want the Italian Communist Party to win the Italian general election. As for the Soviet Union, its focus on Italy is like its focus on Finland, with no difference. After consolidating its position within the Iron Curtain, the Soviet Union has long had the intention of continuing to move its Iron Curtain westward. However, in Southeastern Europe, it is still constrained by Turkey and Greece and cannot do as it pleases. If Italy is controlled by communist forces, not only will Greece and Turkey be subject to its dominance, further consolidating the Soviet Union's position in Southeastern Europe, but the Soviet Union's influence will also extend into the Mediterranean Sea. This would be enough to influence the French general election in May, and the so-called Western European Union would become meaningless. This is the main reason why Italy has become a battlefield of the Cold War.

However, looking at the situation within Italy, the intensity of party strife has reached a fever pitch. Italy is inherently a barren and impoverished island nation. Before the war, it relied on its overseas colonies to be self-sufficient in food and clothing. However, after the war, all its colonies were stripped away, and the sources of food and clothing were cut off. In addition, the Italian people suffered significant losses in the war. Therefore, the post-war Italy, whether in terms of national economy or people's livelihood, is on the verge of bankruptcy. No one can deny that this economic and social background only benefits the rise of the Communist Party. Taking last year's general election results as an example, the Christian Democratic Party received 7.87 million votes, while the Socialist Party and the Communist Party each received 4 million votes, and other parties combined received 4 million votes. In total, the right-wing and third-party votes only exceeded the left-wing votes by 1 million. However, over the past year, Italy's economic situation has deteriorated, and the Communist Party's influence has increased rather than decreased. There are no fewer than 99 political parties participating in this general election. What the future result will be remains an "unknown," but according to authoritative sources, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party may receive 35% to 40% of the votes, while the Christian Democratic Party may only receive 30% to 35%. From this, it can be seen that the future of the De Gasperi cabinet is hardly optimistic. The anxiety of the US government and public is excellent proof of this. Italy's wealthy are preparing to flee, which contrasts sharply with the election campaigns across the country. Prime Minister De Gasperi recently gave a campaign speech, asking the people to "cast a vote of confidence according to their conscience," appealing to the people with his religious fervor. Whether he can awaken the Italian people to appeal to their conscience and cast their sacred vote based on their common-sense judgment will only be revealed on April 18th.

### He Yingqin Returns Home, Arrives in Shanghai, and Will Go to Nanjing This Morning to Attend the National Assembly. It is Said that Increased Foreign Aid Requires One's Own Efforts.

[Our Newspaper News] General He Yingqin, head of the Chinese military delegation to the United Nations Security Council, returned to Shanghai on a Pan American Clipper at 4:10 PM yesterday at Longhua Airport, due to a telegram from the chairman. Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Yu Dayue, Jiang Jingguo, Qian Dajun, Du Yuming and his wife, Jiang Dingwen, Liu Zhi, Fu Zhengmo, Shao Bochang, Zhuang Yuling, and others arrived around 3:00 PM to welcome him. Many of He's former subordinates came from Nanjing to greet him, with a total of over 200 people. There were also honor guards from the Garrison Command's youth military police's third battalion and public training student association lined up for inspection. The scale of the welcome broke all previous records at Longhua Airport. He, wearing a general's uniform, looked well-nourished and radiant. After receiving flowers from representatives of the Girl Scouts and Du Yuming's ten-year-old daughter, he stepped out of the airport to review the honor guard and shook hands with each of the welcoming representatives. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng also arrived before 4:00 PM, but due to his poor health, he did not enter the airport and waited in his car. He walked out of the airport, shook hands with Chen in front of his car, and then drove to his official residence to rest. In order to express their respect, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Department, various bureaus of the Municipal Government, and business representatives held a grand tea party at Yiyuan Hotel at 5:00 PM. He arrived at the meeting at 5:10 PM amidst warm applause. Chairman Fang Zhi delivered a speech, praising He's past achievements and welcoming General Jiang Fengwen, who had recently arrived in Shanghai. Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, then spoke, saying that the large number of people who went to the airport to welcome him today showed the people's high expectations for General He, and hoped that He would display his past spirit to quell the country's turmoil. Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council could not return to welcome him due to attending the National Assembly in Nanjing, and expressed his apologies. The chairman then invited He to speak. He first expressed his deep gratitude for the warm welcome from all walks of life, and then reported on his work abroad (see the written statement for details). He then discussed US military aid to China, believing that the US government and public have been concerned about this in recent months. The aid plan is expected to be decided by the US Congress in mid-April. Although the amount of aid is not large, it can show US concern. He believed that everything must be done by ourselves, so that foreign aid can be continuously increased. Regarding his impressions of the United States, he believed that the wealth of the United States is not only reflected in large cities, but also in rural areas. The production in American rural areas is almost completely mechanized and electrified. Ordinary farmhouses have radios, electric refrigerators, and all sanitary facilities. Their high standard of living cannot be compared with other countries. The reason for this is that the American people abide by the law, order is stable, construction is easy to achieve results, and they are also good at using modern science and technology. However, the rapid progress of the United States in all aspects has only occurred in the last 20 years. If China can restore peace, he believes that after 30 years of dedicated construction, it can also achieve such achievements. Finally, He praised Britain's arduous struggle today, saying that Britain's lack of materials today is even greater than China's, but the people have a tradition of democracy and law-abiding, all controls are thorough and fair, and the royal family and the common people share weal and woe, so although life is hard, the people have no complaints. This spirit is worthy of the Chinese people to learn from. After He finished his speech, there was thunderous applause. Jiang Dingwen was then invited to speak, also praising He's achievements, and saying that "the country has come to this point, and the Chief of Staff must return." The meeting ended at 6:00 PM. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing in the morning to attend the National Assembly.

Written Statement

Elaborates on the Work of the Military Advisory Group

After the tea party, He immediately received reporters in the lounge of the Yiyuan Hotel and issued the following written statement:

"I was sent to the United States in July 1946 to attend the meetings of the United Nations Military Staff Committee. This time I returned to China to report to the central government, ask for instructions on various issues related to the work of the Military Staff Committee, and attend the National Assembly.

"The Military Staff Committee was established under Article 47 of the United Nations Charter, composed of military representatives from the five permanent members of the Security Council, namely China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. It is a military advisory body to the Security Council. It was established in London in February 1946 and moved to New York in March. After its establishment, the Military Staff Committee was instructed by the Security Council to study Article 43 of the Charter from a military perspective; in short, to study the organization of the United Nations army and related military issues. To carry out this research, the Military Staff Committee established five subcommittees (also composed of representatives from the five countries) to conduct discussions. Each issue was first discussed by the subcommittee, and then discussed by the Military Staff Committee. Among them, the most complicated were the 'General Principles for the Organization of the United Nations Army' and the 'Estimates of the Total Strength and Composition' of this army. The 'General Principles for the Organization of the United Nations Army' were completed at the end of April last year and submitted to the United Nations Security Council, where they are still being considered. The principles consist of 41 articles, of which 16 have not yet been unanimously agreed upon by the five countries in the Military Staff Committee. The difficulty of the process can be imagined. After submitting the general principles, the Military Staff Committee continued to discuss the estimates of total strength and composition. The so-called estimate is to study how much force the United Nations army needs and how it should be composed, which is an extremely difficult issue. After eight months, the subcommittee completed the discussion of the estimates of the total strength of the army, navy, and air force, but the opinions of the five countries were still mostly not consistent. This estimate is currently under discussion in the Military Staff Committee. This kind of international armed force organization is unprecedented in history, and international relations are complex and involve many factors. Therefore, it has taken two years and nearly two hundred meetings to achieve the above results, but the representatives of all countries have indeed made great efforts. The detailed situation of the work of the Military Staff Committee has rarely been reported to the country in public in the past because Article 13 of the internal rules of procedure stipulates that it should not be released to the outside world alone. Those that have been approved for publication by the Military Staff Committee, such as the full text of the general principles and the total force estimates submitted by each delegation, have been reported in the newspapers one after another, and will not be repeated here.

"The United Nations army is a practical force for the Security Council to maintain or restore international peace and security, so people all over the world hope that it will be formed as soon as possible. My country's sincere support for the United Nations has been clearly stated in the Constitution. My government is very willing to do its best to assist the work of the Military Staff Committee, and I personally hope to continue to work hard to see it succeed."

Answering Reporters' Questions

No Intention to Run for Vice President

Reporters then raised questions one after another, which He answered one by one. The main points are as follows: (1) It is rumored that General He will run for vice president after returning to China. Is this true? Answer: Serving the country is not about position. I have no intention of running for election. (2) What is Feng Yuxiang doing in the United States? What are your thoughts on his activities? Answer: I met Mr. Feng once when he first arrived in the United States. He inspected the T.V.A. for five or six days. After Feng took an anti-government stance, I did not meet him again. The United States is a democratic country, and all kinds of opinions can be freely expressed. Americans do not value Feng's activities. I believe that the country is in distress, and all people, except the Communist Party, should work together. (3) Does General He believe that the Soviet Union's ambitions will cause a third world war? Answer: There are many Soviet friends in the United Nations Staff Committee. This question is inconvenient to answer. Please forgive me. (4) Americans have always been critical of the Chinese government. What are General He's views on this? Answer: Americans still believe that the reforms of our government are not enough, but they have not specifically stated how to reform. I have not asked Marshall about this. (5) What is the American attitude towards Marshall's policy? Answer: Most people support Marshall's policy of aiding Europe and China.

### Wang Yunwu and Three Others Reply to He Yingqin Regarding the Special Donation for Relief

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Wang Yunwu and others from the Supervisory Committee of the Special Relief Donation of the Executive Yuan previously received a letter from He Yingqin, solemnly denying that he was one of the richest men in the country, which was reported in domestic newspapers, and that he would be the main target of the special relief donation. He only wished to take the lead in donating according to the regulations based on the actual value of his property, in order to promote it. The committee stated that it had always been advocated that government officials should take the lead in the special relief donation, but no decision had been made so far, and the rumors were quite different from the truth. The reply from Wang et al. is recorded as follows: Brother Yingqin of the Military Order, upon receiving your gracious message, I learned everything. I checked the list of the richest people in the country, which this country has not released. The rumors in the newspapers are not credible. However, the special relief donation is an initiative. At a time when bandits are rampant and victims are everywhere, and the country's finances are extremely difficult, general opinion hopes that government officials will take the lead in donating to show their advocacy. My brother feels deeply concerned and has a public spirit. If you can raise your voice and donate generously for the sake of the country, I would be grateful. I will await your reply, and I wish you good health. Wang Yunwu, Gu Zhenggang, Yu Hongjun, and Jiang Yong jointly started.

After leasing, the Philippine side guarantees that Chinese merchants can continue to operate, and will not make things difficult when renewing their licenses every year.

### Reno Announces Abandonment of Exploration After Plane Damaged Upon Takeoff from Beiping

[United Press, Beiping, 31st] The Jishi Mountain exploration plane was preparing to depart at 8:55 this morning at Nanyuan Airport when it crashed less than half a minute later, fortunately without injuring anyone. The four-engine behemoth slowly moved out of the parking area. When it was moving to the runway, the right wheel sunk into the mud, and the wheel pin broke. The fuselage then tilted to the right, causing the rightmost propeller to also sink into the mud. The nose wheel broke, and the belly of the fuselage touched the ground and could not move. Although the damage was not great, even if there were parts to match, it would take several weeks to repair. After inspecting the damage to the fuselage, Reno told reporters: "The exploration is over. Everest is still the highest peak in the world." The pilot, Oden, smiled and said: I don't believe the plane was sabotaged. This unfortunate incident was all caused by the loose soil between the parking area and the runway, which could not support it.

[United Press, Lanzhou, 31st] Scientists from the Jishi Mountain exploration team have expressed impatience because the large team from their country has not yet arrived. American scientists Goswell and Ross and three Chinese scientists arrived here as early as last Thursday. Goswell and Professor McKay must return to the United States within days.

### Another Bloody Case in Jiading: Zhang Shanlin Draws a Sharp Blade and Stabs a Remarried Woman in the Throat; Excessive Bleeding Leaves Her Life Hanging in the Balance

[Our Jiading Dispatch, 30th] A murder case occurred in the home of Qin Genyuan in Meituan, Northwest Corner, on the evening of the 28th. According to this reporter's investigation: Qin Genyuan was a tax collector during the enemy and puppet regime. Because he extorted donations and oppressed the villagers, he was killed before the victory. His wife, Zhu, nicknamed A Xiao, is now 34 years old. After Qin's death, she met Zhang Shanlin, who worked at the Fuda Flower Shop in Ximen, and with the consent of his aunt, Tang, they began living together. Shanlin tried his best to maintain the Qin family's livelihood. Later, Shanlin partnered with someone to open a rice mill, but the business failed, and he owed Tang 30 dans of wheat. He was unable to repay it for a while, which caused constant quarrels within the family. Recently, the relationship between Zhu and Shanlin deteriorated further, and Shanlin suspected Zhu of improper behavior, leading him to consider killing her out of jealousy. At about 7 p.m. on the 28th, Shanlin lured Zhu away from her home. When they reached a small bamboo bridge dozens of steps away, Shanlin, seeing that no one was around, pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed Zhu directly in the throat, hitting the lower jaw. Zhu immediately fainted to the ground, and Shanlin fled without a trace. The police have issued strict orders to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice. Zhu's injuries were discovered, and doctors were immediately called for treatment. Due to excessive bleeding, she is still in critical condition.

### Old Debts of the Changzhou Tragedy: Abandoned Wife's Grievance: Yuan Jinjin Accuses Lu Zhiren of Forcibly Seizing Someone Else's Wife and Killing Her Husband

[Our Wujin Dispatch, 31st] Lu Zhiren, the boss of Zhiren Tinfoil Shop on Nanda Street in our county, has recently been sued by his abandoned wife, Yuan Jinjin, for forcibly seizing someone else's wife and colluding with the enemy and puppet authorities to kill her former husband, Gu Wencan. She is demanding that Lu be arrested and severely punished. Lu Zhiren is fond of women and originally had an affair with Yuan Jinjin, but after a long time, he became tired of her and made a new love. Yuan was very angry at being abandoned and sued him to the court for abandonment and inflicted violent injuries on her, which were verified as scars. Lu was once imprisoned, but he used his wealth and was released soon after. Yuan disregarded everything and revealed all the past secrets. Originally, Yuan Jinjin was married to Gu Wencan, and she was only eighteen years old at the time. Lu lured her in many ways, and she fell into his trap. First, they rented a house to live together, and then he tricked her into taking everything she owned and running away with Lu, who then became rich overnight. Lu initially used the power of the enemy and puppet forces to lure Gu Wencan into the city, forcing him to sign an unconditional divorce, and Lu and Yuan openly lived together. Later, when he heard that Gu had joined the underground work, Lu feared retaliation and conspired with Commander Teng, an enemy and puppet official with whom he had close ties, to lure Gu into prison, where he was tortured and beaten to death. The father of the deceased, Gu Huansheng, also committed suicide by hanging himself because of this. This happened in 1942. The process was very cruel and poisonous. Yuan Jinjin only revealed it today, and those who spoke said that the wheels of heaven turn slowly but surely, and Lu Zhiren will not escape the law.

### Revised Regulations on Restrictions on the Use of Private Cars: Stipulating the Limited Amount of Gasoline Required

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] After the promulgation of the regulations on restricting the use of private cars, some difficulties arose during implementation. Because the principles were too strict, various parties put forward many suggestions for improvement. The US Embassy also submitted a memorandum stating that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Utilities Bureau had successively announced the standards for the registration and transfer of public and private cars and stopped processing the registration and licensing of private cars, which would cause various difficulties for car importers and individuals who purchased cars and resold them. It is hoped that the relevant Chinese government agencies will reconsider the regulations on the use of private cars in the austerity implementation plan and that restrictions should be imposed on gasoline allocation methods, vehicles, taxes, and license plates in order to be fair. The Shanghai Municipal Government also submitted a proposed "Method for Using and Conserving Gasoline to Control the Use of Cars." The reason is that it has been clearly ordered to stop individuals from bringing cars into the country from abroad, and car dealers have also set a limit on the number of cars imported each month. If strict restrictions are placed on the users of these imported cars, the vehicles will be left idle, the parts will be damaged, and they will become waste. If the permitted cars are limited to individuals or private legal entities that meet the regulations, then there will be cases of impersonation in future car sales and registration. Furthermore, British and American merchants have repeatedly expressed objections to our country's restrictions on cars. Therefore, it is considered necessary to change the regulations. It is now known that the Executive Yuan's Austerity Supervision Committee has re-examined the original plan, revised it to restrict the use of private cars, and stipulated restrictions on the gasoline required, such as limiting small cars to 60 gallons per month and large cars to 100 gallons per month.

### Nanjing Special Criminal Court Scheduled to Formally Inaugurate Today

### Aftermath of Deng Case in Yiyang: County Magistrate Tian Expresses Remorse, Resigns to Compensate the Bereaved Family, and Li Zhonghuai of the County Party Headquarters is Dismissed

### The Unfinished Granary

— Our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng

[This newspaper reports] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei wrote on the memorial stele of the reopened Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: "Hunan and Jiangxi produce rice, and Zhejiang produces salt. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is essential for trade and commerce and is of great importance to the livelihoods of ordinary people." We traveled along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Hangzhou and saw mountains of varying distances in Xiaoshan, Jinhua, Quzhou, and Jiangshan. As soon as we entered the Jiangxi border, we slowly discovered large expanses of plains, but barren land outnumbered cultivated land. Some of the land had clearly not been fertilized for many years, and the bottom layer of the land was exposed outside, the red color, with withered grass that had not yet recovered lying on the red soil. Because of these plains, we can understand that Jiangxi must have been quite prosperous many years ago. Jiangxi Province has 173,513 square kilometers, with 1,500 mu per square kilometer, which means there are 260,026,950 mu. According to surveys, there are 38,486,513 mu of cultivated land. Obviously, this is a congenital prototype granary, and with the united efforts of the common people, a fruitful harvest can be expected.

Jiangxi Granary is Nominal

Looking at Jiangxi Province with an objective eye, we feel that Jiangxi Province is indeed a rice-producing area, but unfortunately it has not been developed. The reason why it has not been developed is of course because of the small population. With a small population, it is impossible to produce a particularly large amount of grain. However, now all places believe that Jiangxi is a granary. Hunan rice is used to supply Guangdong and Guangxi, and Jiangxi rice certainly has a surplus. Therefore, even recently Shanghai wants to give up buying锡米 and buy赣米, then the people of Jiangxi will be in a panic again.

The Four Famous Towns are Closely Related

In this nominal granary, there are also four famous towns, namely Zhangshu, which is a distribution center for medicinal materials, and is commonly known as "medicine is not complete without Zhangshu." This town is also one of the outlets for rice. The second is Jingde, which is the place of origin for porcelain. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, it produced 500,000 dans. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, it produced more than 470,000 dans. Now it only produces 300,000 dans, which is not very prosperous. The third is Hekou, which is the distribution center for 100,500 dans of Jiangxi paper. Now, due to cost and sales problems, production has decreased, and the market has also declined. One is Wucheng, which is the distribution center for timber. It is said that Jiangxi produces more than 17 million trees a year, most of which are transported by water from here. It has not been prosperous after the war. The value of the Zhezhan-Jiangxi Railway will be reduced. These four famous towns are actually closely related to the granary, because the prosperity of the countryside will make these four famous towns more prosperous, and the large population will attempt to manage other special industries. Today, the most important thing in Jiangxi Province is to fully reclaim the wasteland in Jiangxi and promote prosperity, so that all waste can be carried out. Before reclamation, we should still have the prerequisites for disturbing the good farmland and water conservancy.

The Plan is Perfect, but Funding is Difficult to Raise

Now Jiangxi Province has a relatively long-term plan for farmland water conservancy, such as the "K.V.A." plan, which is to manage the water of the Gan River in order to store it during floods for power generation or irrigation of farmland. This is certainly a good plan, but it is easier said than done. Although all the surveys have now been completed, there is really no way to get the funding to start the renovation. According to Hong Gui, Director of the Gan Finance Department, 50% or more of Jiangxi's finances rely on central government allocations. However, if the central government borrows more than 10 million dans of grain from Jiangxi, and if 5 million ancestors can be repaid in the future, the "K.V.A." plan can also be carried out.

100,000 Reservoirs Store Water to Prevent Drought

Secondly, Jiangxi Province has 100,000 reservoirs to store water to prevent drought, and when there is too much water, the excess water can also be injected into the reservoirs. This is certainly a good plan. Hu Jiazhao, Director of the Jiangxi Construction Department, told reporters: We are now slowly starting to do it, and of course there will not be a very large effect in a short time. Again, it is to renovate Poyang Lake. The area around Poyang Lake is fertile land. If it can be renovated well, it can greatly increase production. Jiangxi Province is also starting to do it. These agricultural water conservancy plans are difficult to see the effect in a short time.

Repairing Ditches and Ridges Facilitates Cultivation

Before the plan is realized, we had better simply repair the fields, ridges, and ditches for them, so that the relocated people or the returned people can easily cultivate. If we go one step further and build or specially contract a model village, thoroughly improve the life of the countryside, so that farmers can rest and have fun, so that farmers can have their mountains, and truly realize the Principle of People's Livelihood, then people who suppress the city and are troubled will also return to the countryside because of this, then the countryside of Jiangxi should be the most ideal.

It is easy to build a desolate and ruined place, but we hope to build the foundation firmly and thoroughly, and quickly complete and enrich this granary in Central China! (March 28. Nanchang)

### United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission Declares Indefinite Recess: The United States Increases Funding to Study Atomic Secrets

[This newspaper reports] New York, 31st Broadcast: Washington News, Members of Congress today stated that the United States has a sufficient number of atomic bombs and is still constantly manufacturing them. They said that this news came from Mr. Lilienthal, Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission. Lilienthal made a secret testimony before the House Appropriations Committee on February 28 this year.

[Success Lake, Reuters, 30th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission, which was ordered to draft an international atomic energy control agreement, collapsed completely today. The commissioners successively stated that it was meaningless to continue the discussion due to the stubborn position of the Soviet Union. With the support of the United States in England, Belgium, France and Canada, a motion was made to dissolve the Atomic Energy Control Commission. Professor史戈培尔钦, the Soviet representative and chairman of the committee, with the support of Ukraine, tried to keep the discussion going. He said that the Soviet Union's previous view that any international atomic energy control agency should not interfere with the sovereignty of the country, he said that the discussion was deadlocked, not because of a small number of members, but because the majority of members firmly supported the views of the United States. He also believed that the Soviet Union's proposal was a concrete opinion and could be used as a practical basis for atomic energy control. Finally, the chairman announced an indefinite recess of the Atomic Energy Control Commission. The Working Committee (Technical Committee) of another atomic energy organization, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, will also be declared dead on Monday, and then the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission will report the failure of its mission to the United Nations General Assembly.

[Washington, United Press Agency, 30th] The US House Appropriations Committee passed an additional $150 million for atomic research on the 30th and urged federal officials to step up the research program. It is said that the committee will advise the Atomic Energy Commission to conduct a full study of the peacetime and wartime uses of newly discovered atomic energy secrets. After this proposal is put forward, it will bring this year's atomic research funding to US$659,090,000.

### US Foreign Aid Unification Bill: Congress Can Reach a Compromise: Western Participation in the Reconstruction Plan Causes Resentment From All Sides

[This newspaper reports] New York, 31st Broadcast: Washington News, the Senate and the House of Representatives will be able to reach a compromise on the US$6.25 billion foreign aid bill and send it to the President in the middle of this week. However, the Senate expressed opposition to including Spain in the European reconstruction plan. In Europe, England, France, and Italy were shocked and indignant at the decision of the US House of Representatives to allow Spain to join the European reconstruction plan, especially Italy, which believes that this move will strengthen the position of the Communist Party in the elections on April 18 and reduce the meaning of the British, American, and French proposals to return the special port to Italy. Madrid officials expressed "gratification." Moscow has not yet commented, but all parties believe that this action by the US House of Representatives will help the Soviet Union carry out a diplomatic "cold war."

[Paris, French News Agency, 30th] The Spanish Republican side here was furious when it heard of the resolution of the US House of Representatives and said that if it decides to sacrifice Spanish democracy, it will be impossible to solve the Spanish problem by peaceful means.

The Western imperialists also expressed disappointment at this decision by the US House of Representatives, saying that the tension of the international situation led to it.

[London, Reuters, 30th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office recently stated that the decision of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee to allow Spain to participate in the Marshall Aid Program to Europe will not affect Britain's attitude towards Spain. Observers here also believe that the United States' decision allows Spain to obtain economic assistance on the same conditions as the other sixteen countries. Although it cannot be prevented, if such assistance is placed under the management of the歇尔 Plan, it will inevitably require the consent of the sixteen European countries for Spain to join the European Economic Cooperation Committee. This resolution must be established by the European Economic Cooperation Committee at its next plenary meeting, which will be held in mid-April, when the chief representatives of the sixteen countries will meet to review the recommendations of the working committee on the establishment of a permanent institution for the purpose of managing US aid and coordinating self-help cooperation measures among the sixteen countries. At that time, if it is proposed to allow Spain to participate, Britain will still oppose Spain under the rule of the Franco regime based on its established policy.

### Spain Strengthens Military Power to Take Anti-Communist Measures

[Madrid, Associated Press, 30th] It was rumored today that the Franco government, in view of the threat of communism in Europe, especially Italy, has prepared to increase its troops to about 300,000 in order to take precautions. There is no official news about this plan, but it is said that the conscripts of the 1948 and 1949 classes will be called into the army a few months in advance.

### Aircraft Carrier Given to Turkey by the United States

[This newspaper reports] New York, 31st Broadcast: Ankara News, An American aircraft carrier will be given to Turkey under the aid to Turkey program. A number of aircraft will be transported to Turkey by three American aircraft carriers and handed over to the Turkish government.

### "Times and Crisis": Stimson's Memoir Published

[New York, Reuters, 30th] Women's Home Magazine recently published the memoir of former Army Chief Stimson, entitled "Times and Crisis." Stimson revealed that he had suggested to President Truman at the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945 to use the secret of the atomic bomb as a tool to democratize the Soviet secret police state. Stimson believed that if the world organization contained a police state, the new organization would not be able to effectively control it. A few months later, Stimson also admitted that the suggestion was unusable. Stimson said that Stalin at Potsdam expressed a strong interest in obtaining bases in the Mediterranean and other areas outside the Soviet sphere of influence. When the United States began to prepare for the offensive in the Pacific, the Red Army expanded its power in Europe day by day, believing that support for the Soviet Union's excessive demands. At that time, Stimson knew that there could be no permanent and secure international relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. In September 1945, he wrote to Roosevelt, expressing that he knew that the secret of the atomic bomb could not be used to change the Soviet Union's attitude. He also submitted a memorandum to Roosevelt, pointing out that if the United States continued to negotiate with the Soviet Union while holding the secret of the atomic bomb, it would be enough to increase the Soviet Union's suspicion of the United States. Therefore, he suggested that the United States, with the support of the United Kingdom, should directly contact the Soviet Union to establish an agreement on the control of the atomic bomb. As a result, his suggestion was not adopted. In 1947, although he knew that the hope of directly contacting the Soviet Union for atomic energy control was less than in 1945, he still thought it was worth a try. By the time of his eightieth birthday in September of that year, he had confirmed that it was impossible to stand side by side with the current communism for the same goal. Stimson did not think that the Soviet Union would launch a war. He urged Americans who were willing to make peace with the Soviet Union to fully participate in the work of Western European reconstruction, quickly establish world peace rather than American peace, and at the same time engage in the establishment of freedom and prosperity within the United States.

### Montgomery Flies to Brussels

[London, French News Agency, 31st] British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery left London by plane this morning for Brussels to inspect the Belgian army. He will then travel from Belgium to Germany to inspect the British occupation forces in Germany. He is expected to return to England on April 7.

### US Suggests to the Security Council: Urge Immediate Armistice Between Arabs and Jews; Requests the Convening of a UN General Assembly to Consider the Holy Land Issue

[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] Today, the United States submitted two resolutions to the Security Council requesting an immediate armistice in Palestine and the convening of a special session of the UN General Assembly. The former states, "The Security Council, recognizing that the maintenance of international peace and security is its primary responsibility, is deeply concerned about the increasing violence and disorder in Palestine. It believes that an immediate armistice in Palestine is a matter of urgency. The Security Council specifically requests the Jewish Agency and the Arab Higher Committee to nominate representatives to the Security Council to negotiate an armistice between the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine." The latter resolution states, "The Security Council, having received the resolution passed by the General Assembly on November 29, 1947, regarding Palestine on December 9, 1947, and subsequently having received the first and second monthly reports of the United Nations Palestine Commission and its hundredth special report on security issues, and having instructed the permanent members of the Security Council on March 5, 1948, to engage in discussions, hereby requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in accordance with Article 20 of the Charter, to convene a special plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly to consider the future government of Palestine." When submitting this resolution, US Representative Austin stated that the armistice should include a cessation of political and military activities.

### Soviet Union States Its Position

Insists on Partition, Opposes Trusteeship

[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] Soviet Representative Gromyko spoke next, opposing the US proposal to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the Palestine issue. It is claimed that the US wants to overturn the Palestine partition plan in order to save its oil rights and military interests in the Middle East. There is no reason to convene a special session of the General Assembly. The US proposal for a UN trusteeship is merely an excuse to maintain order and turn Palestine into an American and British military base. The United States should bear full responsibility for the cancellation of the Palestine partition plan. Gromyko's attitude foreshadows his use of the veto in the Security Council, at which point the US will have to consult with member states individually. If it obtains the statutory majority of twenty-nine votes, it can convene a special session of the UN General Assembly.

### Four Powers Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty: Soviet Union Shows Concession

The committee also passed two resolutions from France in order to ensure: (1) the broadest possible access to sources of information, both public and private, without discrimination; (2) the elimination of unreasonable or discriminatory taxes levied on foreign news agencies or reporters. The Soviet Union and its supporters opposed both resolutions.

[United Press, the capital of Colombia, 30th] US Secretary of State Marshall proposed today in the preparatory meeting of the Pan-American Conference to discuss the activities of the Communist Party in the Western Hemisphere but did not directly mention the name of the Communist Party. Marshall said: "I would like to ask if the current agenda permits discussion of the subversive conspiracies of foreign countries against the systems, peace, and security of the Americas. I have heard that the countries participating in the conference are very concerned about this issue. I wonder if it can be discussed?"

The Labor Minister met with Gillen throughout the morning of the 31st, and it is expected that this meeting will facilitate the achievement of a basis for agreement.

[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] According to sources here: US Under Secretary of the Army Draper and his team will return to the US by plane at 5 pm on April 2.

### Cave Exploration

Descent Reaches 490 Meters: Underground Lakes Discovered

[French News Agency, Forcalquier, 30th] A team of scientists exploring the world's deepest cave, the Gara Taer Cave, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence in southeastern France, reached a depth of 490 meters this morning. When they reached 300 meters, the path became too narrow to proceed, so they had to turn back. They then found a side path at a higher location and proceeded again, discovering another cave, and then descended to a depth of 490 meters. The explorers sent a telephone message from the cave, requesting that a rubber boat be lowered down, as they had apparently discovered underground lakes.

### US States It Never Recognized Soviet Annexation of Baltic States

[US News Agency, Washington, 30th] The State Department today alerted the governors of the forty-eight states of the United States to the fact that the US government does not recognize the incorporation of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union. This notice was made in a letter from the State Department to the governors because the Soviet Consul in New York City had sought to represent Latvians, Estonians, and Lithuanians who were not permanent residents of the United States in dealing with estates left by those who died in the United States. The State Department's letter asked the governors to notify state courts of the US government's position so that they would have a basis for handling estate cases.

### General Chennault on US Policy Toward China

Copyright by Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance Translated by Our Editorial Office

(5) Stilwell, the Implementer of the Policy

General Stilwell, the main implementer of the wartime US policy toward China, used American lend-lease supplies as a means of control throughout his three years of dealing with the Chinese central government.

He used lend-lease as a magic weapon, attempting to eventually rule China - but failed as a result.

Stilwell lacked friendly respect and candor in handling Sino-American cooperative relations. He was almost always uncoordinated with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, seemingly not regarding him and other Chinese leaders as colleagues, but treating them as obstacles to be overcome. Threats were his most proficient method of persuasion.

Stilwell and his staff either used pressure to demand expanded powers in China, or when Washington did not allow him to do so, they criticized Washington for being "weak and incompetent." Official records show that he repeatedly requested Washington to grant him the power to use the cessation of supplies as a means to deal with Chongqing. This action was well known in China.

Based on what I know about the circumstances of his recall in 1944, I believe that his final threat was that unless he could freely control China's combat power, all aid to China would be stopped, or even worse. Whether President Roosevelt supported this claim is unknown.

Although, for various reasons, this historic "ultimatum" has been kept secret by both the Chinese and American governments, I have no doubt about its possible impact - that is, replacing Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek with General Stilwell.

Throughout Stilwell's tenure as commander of the China-Burma-India Theater and chief of staff to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, this was the goal that determined his actions. Therefore, from the time Stilwell walked out of Burma in 1942 and suggested placing the Chinese army under the administration of American officers, until the dramatic showdown in 1944 when he was forced to be recalled from Chongqing, this goal controlled US relations with China.

Up to that time, Stilwell's actions did not qualify him for this huge task, and the military defeats in China that led him to make this major demand were due as much to his own shortcomings and short-sightedness as to those of the central government, or even more so. Later, I will analyze the causes and effects of this.

But aside from all other considerations, if Stilwell's final request to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had been granted, I believe that this would have led to the darkest failure of US policy toward China. The result could only have been the disintegration of a country whose friendship and strength, no matter how often we misjudge, has always been and still is our greatest asset in the Eastern Hemisphere.

I know the emotions and personality of the Chinese people deeply, and I am certain that neither Stilwell nor any foreigner can rule them unless through force and with the help of Chinese puppets. However, as Stilwell's successor, General Wedemeyer, soon made clear, there is another reasonable and effective way to get along with the Chinese government, which Stilwell never tried.

In recent months, the United States has again insisted on "reform" as a prerequisite for helping China resist communism, which makes me wonder if Washington has reverted to the spirit of Stilwell's undesirable method. Are we able to once again demand practical concessions from the central government as the price for our aid to China?

Obviously, long after Stilwell was recalled, even after his death, his misjudgment of the central government still had a subtle and prejudicial influence on our country's post-war policy toward China. This is not unnatural, because Stilwell's view of China had been influencing Washington's attitude for a long time.

I feel that the real reason for the failure of Stilwell's mission has never been officially acknowledged by Washington: that is, a person was sent to perform a task that exceeded his ability and was incompatible with his personality, as I would like to point out in these memoirs.

For fear that people might think I am discriminating against someone who is no longer able to defend himself, I should explain that I had placed this criticism before him long before Stilwell's death. As far as I know, this did not elicit a response from him.

Even so, I would not be willing to do so if I could not be sure that my public account of what happened could clarify the sound purpose of one of the most misunderstood chapters in the history of World War II, and this chapter is now very important for properly understanding our country's relationship with China.

### Two Types of Rice Rationed This Month: Allocation Increased, Price Determined; Sales Begin Today and End on the 25th

[Report from Our Newspaper] The price of rice rations in the city for April has been decided by the three-person committee. The rice price is divided into two types: high-quality US rice costs 310,000 yuan per person, and lower-quality domestic rice costs 250,000 yuan per person. Each person can get 15 catties and 10 taels of rice, which is 10 taels more than the 1 dou (approximately 12.5 catties) per person in March.

The three-person committee held a meeting at 5 pm yesterday in the mayor's office at the city government. In addition to Mayor Wu, representatives from the Food Department, Ye Shifu, and the Administrative Yuan's US Aid China Relief Material Handling Committee, Pan Guanghui, the chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, Ren Xianqun, attended. According to Ren's report after the meeting: the April rice ration is divided into two types, US rice and domestic rice. The US rice comes from twelve different regions in the United States and can be divided into three types based on its color: (1) Deep yellow: Its characteristic is that it does not spoil after long storage. Even after being cooked, it will not deteriorate within a week. Moreover, this kind of rice is particularly rich in nutrients because it was steamed under high pressure before milling, so all the nutrients in the husk are penetrated into the rice. It is said that it only needs to be poured with boiling water to turn raw rice into cooked rice, so it is very precious in India and the price is very high. (2) White: The quality of the rice is equivalent to China's second-grade second-quality japonica rice, which is very expansive. (3) Light yellow: The rice is sticky and expansive. In addition to the above three types of US rice, there is also good quality Siamese rice and Burmese rice purchased by the government. The material is excellent and it is decided to be included in the US rice category. Its price is the same as US rice, set at 310,000 yuan for 15 catties and 10 taels per person.

Regarding domestic rice, in addition to the remaining 10 or more dan (approximately 1000-1200 catties) of rice from the March ration, there are also more than 10,000 tons of rice that the United Nations planned to transport to the Communist areas in North China last year. Later, due to traffic obstructions, it could not be shipped, and the government bought it. It has been a long time, the quality is poor, and various types of rice are mixed together. When the authorities distribute it this month, they will still maintain the original price of 240,000 yuan per dou in March. The reason why it is now set at 250,000 yuan per person is because the quantity has increased by 10 taels compared to March. The deadline for the April rice ration is set from today (the 1st) to the 25th.

Two Types of Cooking Oil Prices

In addition, the rationing of cooking oil per person has been set to be implemented this month. Each person will be rationed 12 taels of oil per month, which can be freely bought and sold according to the rice rationing rules. The price of cooking oil is: vegetable oil, soybean oil, and sesame oil cost 50,000 yuan per person; raw oil costs 55,000 yuan per person. It will start from the 11th of this month and end on the 25th.

### Rickshaw Boy: Main Character Found in the Former Capital: Name Temporarily Not Released

Huang Zongzhan Invited by Madame Chiang to Go to Beijing Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Huang Zongzhan, a famous Chinese cinematographer from Hollywood, USA, returned to China from the US in the middle of last month specifically to collect materials for the movie "Rickshaw Boy", to take outdoor shots in Beijing and to look for the main character. It is now known that Mr. Huang has returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. It is said that after arriving in Beijing, due to several days of bad weather, he only obtained more than 300 feet of 16mm color outdoor shots, but he has found a male and female protagonist in Beijing, namely Rickshaw Boy and Tiger Girl, and has taken many photos of them, intending to take them back to Hollywood for research along with the color film. However, since it is still unknown whether they are suitable for the roles after the research, Mr. Huang is temporarily unwilling to announce the names and identities of the two protagonists. Mr. Huang continued: after arriving in Shanghai, he visited various film studios for several days, and will go to Beijing today. This trip to Beijing is at the invitation of Madame Chiang Kai-shek. It is reported that Madame Chiang is very interested in 16mm films, and believes that they are a major tool for promoting film education, so she intends to talk to Mr. Huang. After arriving in Beijing, Mr. Huang will first visit General Huang Renlin, and after staying in Beijing for three or four days, he will return to Shanghai and then return to the United States.

### Coal Ship Sinks Two Wooden Barges: Awaiting Collision Committee's Judgment

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Liangxin" ship of the Zhongyuan Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai from Keelung the day before yesterday, carrying 4,600 tons of coal for the Fuel Commission. At about 3 pm, it docked at the Kaiyuan Coal Wharf in Pudong. At that time, several wooden barges were docked at nearby piers, including two that had been loaded with about 100 tons of coal, which was fuel for the Pudong Electric Company. When the "Liangxin" ship was docking, it was during the high tide and the current was rapid. It dropped anchor to assist docking, but when it raised the anchor, the engine malfunctioned and the ship retreated, damaging the two coal barges. The two coal barges immediately sank. The employees of the wooden barges all escaped to the pier, and fortunately no one was injured. The coal carried by the "Liangxin" ship was originally scheduled to be unloaded in the city. After arriving in Shanghai, it was ordered by the Fuel Commission to be transported to another port for unloading, so it was exported at about 2 pm yesterday. The incident has been reported to the Maritime Administration Bureau, awaiting the judgment of the Collision Committee.

### Representatives of the Xuzhou Relief Association Come to Shanghai to Request Relief for Refugees

Chen Lingya, the representative of the Xuzhou Eight Counties and Cities Relief Association, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. According to what he told reporters: "Last year, Xuzhou suffered hail disasters in the wheat crop and flooding in the autumn, resulting in reduced food production. In addition, Communist bandits disturbed the area, looting everywhere, causing the countryside to be devastated and impoverished. Moreover, in the thirty or forty counties in southern Shandong and eastern Henan, the Communist bandits conducted liquidations, and good farmers fled to Xuzhou. Displaced people died at a rate of thirty or forty people per day, and groups of people come south to Beijing and Shanghai, reaching several thousands per day. Therefore, the speakers of the Xuzhou Eight Counties and Cities councils went to Beijing to appeal to the relevant authorities. Foreigners in Xuzhou also elected representatives Peng Yongen and Rong Shiqian, along with myself, to come to Shanghai to request assistance from the US Government's China Relief Group. They have obtained the sympathy of the group and instructed Peng and others to draft an urgent relief plan and submit it to the association for discussion, hoping that part of the funds from the food and sales items in the five major cities can be allocated to handle relief in Xuzhou. In addition, the Ministry of Social Affairs has also promised to allocate funds for relief, intending to use work as relief and assist local construction."

### Adjusting Rickshaw Rental: Social Affairs Bureau Advocates Adopting Flexibility

[Report from Our Newspaper] The rental prices of rickshaws and tricycles in the city were previously determined by the Vehicle Rental Review Committee at a meeting on January 3, based on the then-current vehicle rental prices and general commodity prices. The vehicle rentals were assessed for January 1 to March 31, with rickshaws set at 34,000 yuan per day, single-seat tricycles at 60,000 yuan per day, and double-seat tricycles at 69,000 yuan per day. It was also stipulated that adjustments would be made every three months. Now, the vehicle rentals for April to June need to be assessed urgently, and the Vehicle Rental Review Committee has scheduled its second review meeting for 2 pm on the 7th of this month at the Social Affairs Bureau. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau believes that the vehicle rentals for January to March had already exceeded the regulations in practice within half a month of the assessment, and the committee's decision was equivalent to a mere formality. Therefore, this assessment advocates that vehicle merchants and drivers make flexible adjustments based on the current commodity prices, and submit them for discussion at the meeting on the 7th.

### Two Bandits Who Committed a Kidnapping in Dinghai Arrested in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 10:00 PM on the 15th of this month, Ouyang Jirong, a patrol officer of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Yulin Road Police Station, was patrolling the Jiangjia Bang area of Gaolang Bridge with police officer Yue Mingzhong and others when they spotted a man loitering by the side of the road whose actions were suspicious.

They arrested two men and took them to the station. One of them, Dai Jianqing, 33 years old, from Dinghai, also known as Li Baogen, and the other, Li Jiqing, 27 years old, from Ningbo, both confessed to having committed three kidnapping and extortion cases in Dinghai: (1) Kidnapping Chen Acheng, the owner of an ice boat in Dengtou, Shenjiamen, and hiding the hostage in Gaosuo Township for about a week, sending a letter to his family demanding a ransom of 10 million legal tender.

### The Mystery of the Madman: Yan Peixing and His Wife Each Hold Their Own Views; Confusing and Unpredictable Family Dispute

The crux of the matter lies in the huge fortune

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yan Peixing, a native of Wuxi, accused his wife of coveting his property, forcibly declaring him insane, and sending him to the Puji Sanatorium for confinement. Since the Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association exposed the matter and hired lawyers such as Zhou Xiaoan to publish statements in the newspaper, his wife, Yan Yuan Baoying, also hired lawyers such as Xian Wenguang to publish rebuttal notices yesterday, and hosted reporters at 3:00 PM, presenting various documents. On the other hand, the Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association also hosted reporters again last night. Both sides held their own views, and the inside story was extremely confusing.

Whether Yan Peixing has a mental illness is one of the focuses of this case. Yan Peixing himself, the Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association, and his relatives on his side said that he absolutely does not. Yuan Baoying, however, said that he definitely has a mental illness. Yuan presented many documents and photos at yesterday's reception. These documents were all written by Yan Peixing under the name "Yan Ti," with absurd and nonsensical language. For example, "Starting from January 1 of the year of each country in the world, implement the first year of the Lord, the government of the Lord, the imperial system, the supreme leader is the Emperor, the Heavenly King Yan Ti, the Heavenly Kingdom Emperor Chiang Kai-shek, the American Emperor Truman, the British Emperor George V, the Soviet Emperor Stalin, the four great powers, June 1." "Heaven wants to marry two outstanding Chinese women who can understand the languages of various countries, wants to marry two outstanding American women, wants to marry one outstanding British woman, wants to marry one outstanding Soviet woman, all of whom can understand the international world situation; the above six , hold a wedding ceremony at the same time, introduced and witnessed by the great presidents of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, April 20." "All civil and military ministers of all countries in the world, every month on the first and fifteenth day of the Heavenly Calendar, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, shall all go to court to the Emperor to strike the golden bell as a signal, to report matters if there are any, and to retire after lunch if there are none, July 29." "All Kuomintang, Revolutionary Party, Communist Bandit Party, Socialist Party, Labor Party, Youth Party, Youth League, Youth Association, Blue Shirt Party, Green Shirt Party, Old Man's Refugee Party, Cheaters, Trade Unions, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and other groups and parties, etc., are all abolished, and only obedience to Catholicism is permitted, June 1"... and so on. Similar kinds of ridiculous texts.

A bizarre photograph in addition to absurd text

It is said that there are about one or two hundred of them. In addition to the text, there are also two photos, in which Yan Peixing is sitting with his hair disheveled, with a memorial table in front of him, with a pair of candles on the table. Yuan Baoying is kneeling in front of the table (see photo). It is said that this is a photo of Yan Peixing claiming to be the Emperor of Heaven and demanding that his wife obey him. There is also a large painting by Fang Long of a dragon and a sun, with the words "The True Lord of the Heavenly Dragon." Regarding these absurd texts, photos, and paintings, Yan Peixing himself explained it this way yesterday: part of the text was written by him casually for fun, and part of it was taught to him by Yuan Baoying. As for the photos, it's a long story. At the end of the thirty-fifth year, he was angry with his wife and returned to his hometown of Wuxi. He prepared to bring weapons, but later, after persuasion from his family, his wife came to Wuxi to kneel and beg him to repent. This photo was taken at that time because his wife said she wanted to leave a memento, but unexpectedly it was "a premeditated conspiracy" to use it as evidence of his mental illness; as for that , he was preparing to use it as a trademark for his factory's products.

Slightly Dull Expression, Speech Still Normal

So, does Yan Peixing have a mental illness? From his appearance, apart from a slightly dull expression, there are no unusual signs. At yesterday evening's reception, he reported on his experience in front of the microphone (see photo). Although his speech was slow and not very clear, it could still be considered normal. After leaving the Puji Sanatorium, he went to Renji Hospital for an examination, which, it is said, "showed no mental abnormalities." He also stayed at Yihe Hospital for a few days, where Dr. Huang Zhongqiang issued a certificate stating that he "suffered from cardiac enlargement and high blood pressure." That being said, why did the Puji Sanatorium accept him as a mental patient? To this end, the reporter specially visited Huang Yingbang, the director doctor of the Puji Sanatorium who was responsible for treating Yan Peixing, yesterday.

Puji Sanatorium, Dr. Huang's Speech

Dr. Huang believes that Yan Peixing definitely has a mental illness. In medicine, this disease is called "delirium," and its Western name is Paranoia. Patients sometimes have symptoms of restlessness, insomnia, and heart weakness. There are no special changes in appearance or physiology. In terms of mental capacity, it gradually declines, and after a long time, it will inevitably become dementia. Yan Peixing was sent to the hospital this time with a letter of introduction from the Health Bureau (the source of the Health Bureau's letter of introduction will be described later) and based on the disease report from his family member, Ai Baoying. During the more than forty days that Yan spent in the hospital, he was given one injection of cardiotonic, one injection of morphine, one injection of sleeping pills, and five injections of brain tonics. The so-called eight injections of toxic anesthetics were actually like this. As for the scars on Yan Peixing's wrists, Dr. Huang explained that all mental patients sent to the hospital generally do not admit that they are sick and clamor to be discharged. Therefore, the hospital can use a leather glove to cover the patient's hands when necessary. The leather gloves are tied with straps between the wrists. The scars on Yan Peixing's wrists were caused by struggling after wearing the gloves. Also, Yan Peixing said that the hospital demanded 1 billion yuan to release him. Dr. Huang said that the fact is this: After Yan entered the hospital, he initially said to Huang: "Please help me and connect me with a friend. After I get out, the factory will give you a big position." Later, he often said to him: "Come, come, don't let others hear. You can ask for money, how about 300 million or 400 million?" Yan also said this kind of thing to the tea boys and nurses in the hospital. Huang Yingbang always said, "I will definitely find a way to help you," to comfort him, just like comforting most mental patients. The demand for 1 billion yuan is absolutely not true. "If I really wanted to extort money from him," Dr. Huang said, "I could have let him out long ago."

A Letter of Introduction from the Health Bureau

The content of the letter of introduction from the Health Bureau is as follows: "This Bureau has learned that citizen Yan Peixing, No. 39 Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road, is currently suffering from mental illness. His family and friends are willing to send him to your hospital for treatment at their own expense. Please accept him. To the Puji Sanatorium. Director Zhang Wei." The reporter went to visit Director Zhang Wei yesterday but did not meet him. According to Chief Secretary Cao, on February 7, Yuan Baoying brought the strange characters and photos written by Yan Peixing to meet with Director Zhang and applied. On February 8, Director Zhang wrote "Can be introduced to Puji Sanatorium" on official business, so the Health Bureau issued the letter of introduction.

A Series of Complex Contradictions

Yuan Baoying, who accused Yan Peixing of having mental illness, also said yesterday that Yan's mental illness is hereditary. His grandmother had mental illness, and his younger sister also has mental illness. When she was 21 years old, she had an attack and was naked, but Yan Peixing said that this was absolutely not the case. Also, their daughters, the eldest of whom is fifteen years old, was asked by the reporter yesterday if her father had a mental illness. She said that he had a little bit. She often went to visit him after he entered the hospital. Later, the reporter asked Yan Peixing about this. Yan said that his daughter was helping her mother, and that his seals were stolen by his daughter. Yuan Baoying said that she had cut a piece of meat from her body for Yan Peixing to eat for his illness. When the reporter asked Yan Peixing if this was true, he smiled and said, "There is no need to talk about the past." At this time, the relatives next to Yan said that there was a knife mark on Yan's back, which was stabbed by Yuan Baoying. Yan smiled when he heard this, as if he was unwilling to reveal it. This series of complex contradictions is truly a big mystery—does Yan Peixing have a mental illness? (To be continued in the lower right corner)

Yan Peixing's Expression When Reporting (Photo by This Newspaper)

### Mrs. Yang Hu's Letter of Testimony: Defending Senator Hou

(Continued from the upper left corner) When Yan Peixing was sent to the hospital, were there armed comrades escorting him? This is the second focus of the case. Yuan Maiying said yesterday that she had asked two policemen from the Hongkou Police Station for assistance at the time, but there were no armed soldiers involved. The reporter also asked people at the Puji Sanatorium yesterday if there were armed individuals when Yan was sent to the hospital, and they said they couldn't remember clearly. According to Yan and Yuan's eldest daughter, there were two cars in total when they went; her father, mother, and cousin (i.e., Yuan Baoying's nephew) were in one car, and she didn't know who was in the other.

After Yan Peixing entered the sanatorium, how did his Huaxing Hardware Factory change to Southeast Hardware Factory, and how did Hou Jiyuan become the general manager? This is the third focus of the case. At Yuan Baoying's reception yesterday, there was a letter of testimony written by Mrs. Yang Hu, Tian Shujun, in Nanjing on the 30th and brought to Shanghai by overnight train. The original text is as follows: "This is to certify that Mr. Hou Jiyuan absolutely did not embezzle Mr. Yan's factory or property. At the end of the thirty-fifth year, Mr. Yan's mother sought assistance from Dong Zhujun because her nephew had moved away the factory's assets. Ms. Dong Zhujun informed me of this injustice and asked for my utmost assistance. I then entrusted Senator Hou to report to the police station to recover the items that had been moved from Mr. Yan's factory. Later, the police station investigated and recovered all the original items and handed them over to Mr. Yan. At this time, Mr. Yan, due to being deceived and infringed upon by his nephew, suddenly became mentally ill and was unable to work in the factory. All matters in the factory were managed by Mr. Yan's mother. Therefore, Mr. Yan became ill and was admitted to Puji Hospital for treatment, where he remains to this day. Due to the heavy workload in the factory, Hou Jiyuan was hired as the general manager of the factory, but it was only a nominal position, and the actual responsibility was managed by Mr. Yan's mother's nephew. Unexpectedly, Mr. Yan's nephew again incited the workers to move away the property and falsely accused Mr. Hou and Mr. Yan's mother of having an ambiguous relationship and embezzlement, which is a rumor to mislead the public. This nephew's fabrication is outrageous. In order to uphold justice and not allow this villain to distort the facts, I testify that Mr. Hou is an upright and enthusiastic person and absolutely did not embezzle anything, and that Mr. Yan's nephew should be held responsible for illegal deception, infringement, defamation, and other misconduct."

The Female Boss of Jinjiang Admits to "Intervening for Injustice"

Ms. Dong Zhujun, the owner of Jinjiang Sichuan Cuisine Restaurant, who served as the intermediary, was a friend of Yan Peixing and his wife before the war, having been in the yarn business. At the reception yesterday, she readily admitted that this matter was entirely due to her "righteous indignation" because Yuan Baoying came to her crying and asking for help because the factory's property had been embezzled by her husband's nephew. She "intervened for injustice" and then asked Tian Shujun and Yang Hu for help, and Hou Jiyuan came to "organize" it on her behalf, only serving in a nominal capacity. "Mr. Hou even put in a lot of money," Ms. Dong said. "So now that this has happened, I really feel sorry for him." As for why Huaxing Factory was renamed Southeast, Yuan Baoying said that it was because her husband developed a mental illness and made a mess of the factory. There were many bounced checks issued to the outside world, and the reputation was ruined, so she sent her husband to the hospital for treatment and asked someone else to rename and reorganize the factory.

However, Yan Peixing's side and the Wuxi Fellow Association righteously pointed out: Even if Hou Jiyuan was hired as the manager, Yan Peixing is not dead, so how could his Huaxing Factory be renamed Southeast? How could Hou Jiyuan register with the Social Affairs Bureau? The notice written by Hou Jiyuan in the factory using the official stationery of the Municipal Council has been photographed by them as one of the pieces of evidence.

This complicated family dispute, involving military hospitals and municipal councilors, is extremely bizarre. Exploring its root cause reveals the manipulation of a huge fortune. Yan Peixing's hardware factory property is said to be worth about 30 billion yuan. Although his relatives or outsiders absolutely deny any attempt to covet his property, this case is bound to be seen in court in the near future.

Await Forensic Identification

Yan Peixing and Yuan Baoying, from their appearances, both look honest and kind, but their feelings have broken down to such an extent. The outcome of this case will depend on whether the forensic doctor comes on April 12 to identify whether Yan Peixing has a mental illness, because Yuan Baoying has already applied to the court to "prohibit Yan Peixing from managing his property." The court had originally scheduled a forensic doctor to conduct a joint identification with the鉴定医生 of the Puji Sanatorium at 10:00 a.m. on April 12. The mystery of this sensational Shanghai "madman" will be revealed at that time.

### Owners Eager to Sell, Sales Stagnant: Rice Prices Continue to Fall in North and South Markets; Edible Oil, Flour, and Miscellaneous Grains Decline Across the Board

Yesterday, the rice market continued its downward trend from the previous day, with prices in both the north and south markets falling by about 100,000 yuan. Due to further short selling in Wuxi's quotations, owners had no choice but to depreciate prices, and sellers followed suit, but sales were stagnant. Rice shops on this street, due to the imminent distribution of rice for the second phase of household registration, were reluctant to replenish their stock, so owners were eager to sell, but there were few buyers. Transactions were sluggish, and morale was low. White japonica rice in the South Market has fallen to 3.4 million yuan. Inferior Wuxian rice has fallen below the 3 million mark, at 2.9 million yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan each fell by 100,000 yuan. The People's Food Allocation Association sold spoiled white japonica rice and early rice in the South Market at several different prices, totaling 1,020 shi. The total amount of rice arriving in the north and south markets was 6,572 shi.

Flour

All brands have retreated to within 1.4 million yuan. The reason is nothing more than the decline in rice prices and the sluggish prices in Suzhou and Wuxi, so the market has fallen into a long period of fatigue. Owners are eager to sell as quickly as possible, while buyers are hesitant. Lao Che flour opened at a low price of 1.38 million yuan. Bingchuan was briefly as low as 1.37 million yuan. The market rallied slightly at the close. Lao Che closed at 1.39 million yuan, and Bingchuan closed at 1.385 million yuan, still down 40,000 yuan from the previous day. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and other miscellaneous brands of flour all fell by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Wheat bran first fell, then was picked up by some at a low price, resulting in an increase of 10,000 yuan. Wheat was at 2.05 million yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Morale is low. Those who hold goods are eager to sell, while those who want to buy are hesitant. Soybeans, although barely supported yesterday, plummeted by 150,000 yuan yesterday. Zhadou fell to 1.65 million yuan. Corn sales remained sluggish, falling another 50,000 yuan. Red beans and green beans each fell by 50,000 yuan. Qingping was sluggish. Sesame seeds were not taken by Tianjin dealers, falling by 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were not touched by Guangdong dealers, falling back by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan.

Edible Oil

The downward trend has expanded. Soybean oil plummeted by 400,000 yuan due to the continuous supply from factories and the return of retail investors. Factory soybean oil was mostly at 7 million yuan. Datong and Tongfeng soybean oil once retreated to within 7 million yuan. Raw oil also fell sharply by 400,000 yuan. Owners were eager to sell, but actual sales were sluggish. Qingdao Jiton raw oil was at 8.35 million yuan. Dade New Oil Factory opened raw sesame oil at a low price of 7 million yuan, falling by 600,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil also fell by about 400,000 yuan. Other edible oils all fell across the board. Owners of small car sesame oil were less willing to sell, with the smallest decline, only 280,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were stagnant, falling another 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 31st] The rice market in Suzhou today, due to the unanimous decline in prices in Wuxi and Shanghai, morale softened, and trading sharply decreased. The highest price for brown japonica rice was 2.95 million yuan, white rice was 3.39 million yuan, and the price of upper-grade white rice sold at stores was around 3.5 million yuan.

[Report from Fuzhou, this newspaper, 31st] The rice market remains stable, at around 3.5 million per shi.

### Wuxi Rice and Wheat Downstream

[Report from Wuxi, this newspaper, 31st] Today, prices of goods both rose and fell. Rice and wheat are still downstream, while yarn and oil are rising.

### Sugar Falls Again

Yesterday, the sugar market saw sluggish sales and a further decline. The association's assessment of spot prices for 24 crude white sugar was 4.5 million to 4.45 million yuan, down 150,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half white sugar in bags was 4.9 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan. Sugar in straw sacks was 4.7 million yuan, and 20 medium sand white sugar was 4.2 million to 4.15 million yuan, down 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. For warehouse order transactions, fluctuations ranged from more than 100,000 yuan to 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. The final decline ranged from 240,000 yuan to several tens of thousands of yuan.

### Tea Market Appears Flat but Actually Rising

Yesterday, red and green tea dealers continued to hoard and hold onto their goods, and buyers, feeling that domestic sales were good and foreign demand was urgent, continued to seek out goods at good prices. Prices rose across the board, but some varieties did not show significant gains because the quality of the goods was uneven compared to before, resulting in a situation that appeared flat but was actually rising. It is also learned that the French North African branch of Concorde Foreign Firm has telegraphed Shanghai, requesting to purchase a large quantity of green tea, but due to the limited inventory, it may be difficult to ship smoothly for the time being.

### Industrial and Mining Equipment Depot

[Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 31st] The Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to set up industrial and mining equipment depots in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan to supply industrial equipment to various private enterprises. Preparations are currently underway.

### China-Korea Trade to be Restored Soon: Tianjin and Shanghai Designated Temporarily

[Report from Beiping, this newspaper, 31st] China-Korea trade will soon be officially realized through the designated ports of Tianjin and Shanghai. However, restrictions will be quite strict to avoid exchanging daily necessities for consumables, which would affect the supply of major materials in our country.

It is learned that although private trade between China and Korea has not been opened since the victory, it has never actually stopped. Most of the smugglers are Koreans, and a few are Chinese. The smuggling vessels are all hundred-ton sailboats. There are about 30 such ships traveling between Tianjin and Korea. The goods traded from Tianjin to Korea include glass, glue, belts, chili peppers, food, white spirits, and Chinese medicine. The goods traded from Korea to Tianjin include rayon, caustic soda, wood, seafood, ginseng, and glass sand. The smuggling method is for ships carrying goods to Korea to declare to the Tianjin Customs and open to Qingdao and Yantai. After being released, they change course to Korea. When returning to Tianjin with goods, they repaint the ship and use the name of returning ships of Chinese citizens to declare customs and pay taxes. In addition, there are many who avoid customs and smuggle through detours. In the future, if the opening of China-Korea trade is restricted too strictly, smuggling between China and Korea may still be unavoidable.

### Hong Kong Gold and Foreign Exchange Market

[Report from Hong Kong, this newspaper, 31st] Gold is HK$319 per tael, US$1 is HK$5.70, and CN$1 million is HK$13.

[Report from Guangzhou, this newspaper, 31st] The Hong Kong dollar, which has been rising in a straight line here for the past half month, suddenly fell in a straight line yesterday. The reasons are: (A) A large amount of overseas remittances flowed back to Guangzhou, flooding the market with Hong Kong dollars. (B) The Shanghai market reported favorably. (C) Credit suddenly tightened, and the black market interest rate rose from over 10,000 yuan to 26,000 yuan.

[Associated Press Hong Kong, 31st] The closing prices in the Hong Kong gold and foreign exchange market were as follows: Gold is HK$320.50 per tael, HK$5.70 is US$1, HK$13 is £1, and HK$12.75 is CN$1 million.

### Collection and Payment of Treasury Funds in Various Regions: Adoption of Zonal Transfer System

[News from this newspaper] Since the implementation of the Measures for the Deposit and Remittance of Public Funds by Military and Political Agencies, the Central Bank, in order to promote treasury administration and assist the industry in dealing with the position of treasury funds remitted by various treasury agents on behalf of military and political agencies, has made every effort to transfer funds and facilitate the process. It has also formulated the "Three Banks and Two Bureaus to Apply to the Central Bank for Free Transfer of Funds When Transferring Treasury Funds in Accordance with the Measures for the Deposit and Remittance of Public Funds by Military and Political Agencies," and circulated it to various branches for reference. However, in the past, there was no standard for the allocation locations. For example, for the remittance of funds in Sichuan, some designated to be repaid in Guangzhou, which was inconsistent with the facts and violated the government's financial control policy. It is learned that the new treasury receipt and payment accounting system formulated by the Ministry of Finance has been scheduled to be implemented from 1948. The procedures for the collection, payment, and reporting of treasury funds in various regions will all adopt the zonal transfer system. All treasury fund transfer matters within each zone will be the responsibility of the Central Bank of each sub-treasury for each zone. In the future, the position of treasury funds transferred by various treasury agents will be handled by each sub-treasury and facilitated as much as possible. However, the allocation location should also be limited to the area where the bank where the remittance arrives is located, and cross-regional allocation is not allowed, in order to reflect the facts and comply with the government's financial control policy.

### Deposit Guarantee Reserve Must be Paid in Cash

[News from this newspaper] It is learned that since the promulgation of the Banking Law, the ordinary deposit reserve and savings deposit guarantee reserve that each bank should pay have been uniformly changed to the deposit guarantee reserve. The Ministry of Finance also stipulated that it is temporarily limited to paying in cash and adjusted monthly. Starting this year, it will be reported and paid separately in accordance with the original ordinary deposit reserve method, and the local Central Bank or entrusted bank will handle it. Other matters will also be handled in accordance with the original ordinary deposit reserve method.

### The Central Trust Bureau is Ordered to Promote Barter Trade

This year, the Central Trust Bureau has been ordered to continue to strengthen the promotion of China's foreign barter trade. China's barter trade with foreign countries is most extensive with Japan, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At present, barter trade with Japan is still mainly based on importing rayon and sleepers, and exporting soybeans and sugar. Salt, which is urgently needed by Japan, cannot be exported this year because the Salt Administration has not yet approved the amount available for barter this year. According to sources, if barter trade with Japan for salt cannot be restored, the future is unlikely to be optimistic. Moreover, China's outstanding barter accounts with Japan from last year are currently in urgent need of repayment and settlement. As for barter trade with the United States, there has been no large-scale export or import this year. The items bartered are mostly tea, tung oil, and pig bristles. However, the United States often criticizes that the quality of China's existing export goods is worse than before, and it is often impossible to purchase the same goods at the same price. This concerns the reputation of international trade, and it is hoped that the relevant management authorities and loan authorities will strictly manage to improve the quality of goods to facilitate exports. Barter trade with the Soviet Union is mostly export and less import. Because the government has not yet approved its list of materials and quantities this year, it has not been officially launched. The quantity of barter trade with other countries is very small. Recently, the exporting authorities have encouraged the promotion of China's specialty products, porcelain and firecrackers, to foreign countries. If sales are strong, the foreign exchange and materials exchanged can also greatly compensate for foreign exchange expenditures.

### Adjustment of Domestic Exchange Rate

[News from this newspaper] The domestic exchange rate of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be adjusted by region from today as follows:

Xiamen, 110 yuan per thousand yuan (previously 100 yuan). Guangzhou, 150 yuan (previously 100 yuan). Shantou and Haikou, 180 yuan (previously 150 yuan). Other areas in Guangdong Province, 150 yuan (previously 120 yuan). Chongqing and Chengdu, 50 yuan (previously 20 yuan). Yunnan, 70 yuan (previously 60 yuan). Shaanxi and Gansu, 20 yuan (previously 10 yuan).

### Recent Situation of the Silk Industry in Sichuan Province

The Situation of Sichuan Brocade Has Improved in Recent Years

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw local yarn merchants and commercial guilds seize the opportunity to buy low after the previous day's sharp decline. At the opening, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was quoted between 190 million and 200 million, but as credit among traders eased and manufacturers resumed production, confidence was boosted, and the market stopped falling and rebounded, closing at 203 million, up 1.3 million from the previous day.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with uncertainty and a strong selling pressure, causing the market to dip. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth plunged to 3.93 million with limited transactions, while Five Blessings fine cloth also fell to around 3.85 million. Subsequently, a certain dye factory stepped in to replenish its stock heavily, and northern merchants continued to absorb medium and lower-grade fine cloth. At the same time, with yarn prices showing signs of recovery, confidence returned, and buying interest surged. Shanxi merchants also came to buy, and some traders were inclined to reverse their short positions. Dragon Head fine cloth recovered from its lows to close at 4.16 million, but still down 140,000 from the previous day. Five Blessings Blue Chicken medium and lower-grade fine cloth also fell by 12,000.

Cotton baled by baling plants will be limited to that inspected and certified by the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and those not meeting the above standards will not be allowed to be baled.

### The Purchase of Imported Medicines Upon Arrival Is Not a Mandatory Requirement

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding all finished medicines and medical equipment imported with self-provided foreign exchange without permits, which are not entirely necessary for military needs, the city's Import & Export Association previously requested the Transportation Control Committee to waive mandatory purchases. Now, according to the Transportation Control Committee's reply and explanation: For all finished Western medicines under Tariff Code 481, there is no mandatory requirement to purchase them compulsorily and prohibit prioritized purchases with markups. They are only slightly more restricted than other Western medicine goods, that is, within one month of prioritized purchase with markups, they cannot be freely sold, pending the government's selection and purchase of those suitable for use in suppressing the rebellion from this batch of medicines at a set price. If, after the price is set, there are those not suitable for government use, the purchasing merchant can still freely sell them after the one-month period. Even if purchased by the government at a set price, a profit of up to 15% will be added to the purchase price.

### Electronic Gun Starts, Electric Clock Times: The Scientific Equipment of the World Games, Venue Layouts Rely Heavily on Science

[News from the British Information Service in London on the 31st] When the Olympic Games open in London on July 29th of this year, it will be seen that every effort has been made to ensure that there are no disputes caused by chance luck in the competition, such as competitors at the starting point gaining unexpected advantages due to "the luck of the draw", or at the finish line due to hasty decisions. Where human power is insufficient, scientists and technicians will make it as flawless as possible. In the past, there was a lot of debate about the starting position of the players, because it was thought that the person farthest from the starter would hear the gunshot some fraction of a second later than the person closest to the starter. This criticism can be avoided in this session, because the gun will be fired by remote control. This gun is sixty yards away from the starter and equidistant from each player. This starting gun also makes the timing accurate to a degree. At the finish line, there will be a specially made camera to take pictures of the exact situation when the first six finishers arrive. This photo can be developed in one minute.

There is another strange problem on the venue that must be solved by scientists, that is, what kind of fuel should be used for the Olympic flame so that it can burn continuously in any climate. This flame will be placed in a three-holed earthen basin six feet in diameter, standing on top of an eighty-foot height in the venue. The torch will be lit from the torch relayed from Olympia, Greece, to England. Compressed gas will be continuously injected into this basin so that it can burn regardless of the weather.

The resident engineers of Wembley Stadium also encountered many particularly complex problems. The original activities of the stadium will continue until July 10th, and the opening date of the conference is July 29th. In this short period of time, it is necessary to work day and night to reproduce the track and field course originally built in 1924 from the dog and car racing tracks and level it. Then the conference track must be accurately measured without an inch of difference, and its slope must not have an error of one thousandth of an inch.

Wembley Swimming Pool is the location for swimming and boxing competitions. The ice rink needs to be converted into a swimming pool first. This work includes removing ten miles of salt water pipes and eighteen hundred feet of tubular stands. The entire pool must be repainted, and electrical lines must be reinstalled. Accurate measurement is also essential. After the swimming competition is over, the swimming pool must be converted into a boxing venue again, which is done by building an eighty-foot bridge sign over the pool.

### Review of "A Discourse on the National Assembly System"

— Huang Hongchang

Written by Chen Yuxiang, published by Commercial Press, 315 pages, price 7 yuan.

The National Assembly is a unique institution in China's future new government. It is an institution representing the national people in exercising political power during the constitutional period. Furthermore, because the Constitution of the Republic of China was formulated by it, it is also the sole bridge for transitioning from the period of political tutelage to the constitutional period. The National Assembly, therefore, also has a distinction between being "constitution-making" and "constitution-implementing." Regarding the theory and system of such an institution, we have long desired a systematic work to analyze it. A few months ago, I purchased "A Discourse on the National Assembly System" written by Mr. Chen Yuxiang. After studying it, I feel that Mr. Chen's book has considerable value.

The constitution-making National Assembly was convened in the 35th year, but the dispute over this issue has existed since Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction. The preparation and holding of the National Assembly has also had a history of more than ten years. Books such as "Reference Materials for the National Assembly," "The National Assembly Problem," or "Special Issue on the National Assembly" that have been published on the market are not uncommon. However, these are nothing more than collections of laws, regulations, or fragmentary essays. If one wants to find a specialized work with a more systematic and in-depth study, in my experience, one has to recommend Mr. Chen's book.

This book is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter, "Principles and Methods of Democratic Politics," explains the general principles of very abstract democratic politics, as well as the complex definitions and concepts of democracy, in a span of about 10,000 words. It then addresses the drawbacks of modern representative politics, ultimately answering: "The question now is not whether we should adopt a democratic polity, but rather what method should be adopted to best avoid its unique shortcomings." The second chapter, "The Process of Implementing Democratic Politics in China," explains how China entered democratic politics, starting from the establishment of the political tutelage system to the formulation of the Constitution. The third chapter, "The Characteristics of China's Democratic Political System," provides a very important exposition on the spirit of the entire Chinese Constitution and the central political system of the new government. These first three chapters can be said to be the first part of this book.

The fourth chapter, "The Preparation for the Convening of the National Assembly," and the fifth chapter, "The Evolution of the Organizational Law of the National Assembly," both refer to the constitution-making National Assembly. Although the constitution-making National Assembly only convened once and then concluded, its mission was unprecedentedly significant, and the process of its convening and the evolution of its constituent members were extremely complex. In these two chapters, the author not only describes and analyzes the historical facts of the convening of the National Assembly and its organizational law. The most commendable thing is that the author presents to the reader the background of the repeated postponements of the National Assembly, the causes and consequences of the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, the legislative intent of the organizational law and representative election law of the constitution-making National Assembly, technical issues, and its relationship to or conflict with the May 5th Constitutional Draft. Reading these two chapters, we can see the author's thorough research on this issue. These two chapters are the second part of this book.

Chapters six through nine are the third part of this book, and also the most important part of this book, accounting for one-half of the entire book. The sixth chapter describes the historical process of designing the National Assembly system, and various studies and proposals by the Chinese people regarding the National Assembly system over the past ten years are briefly introduced and commented on in this chapter. The seventh chapter is a purely theoretical study, the main purpose of which is to elaborate on the subtleties of the nature of the National Assembly. In this chapter, the author explains very thoroughly the boundaries and differences between the terms political power, governing power, ruling power, sovereignty, etc., and has unique insights into why the National Assembly is an organ of political power, expressing what others have not expressed. Chapters eight and nine are about the election and recall of National Assembly representatives and their powers during meetings. The National Assembly chapter of the Constitution of the Republic of China has a total of ten articles, which are analyzed in detail in chapters seven, eight, and nine, and relevant constitution-implementing laws and regulations are often cited as necessary.

The structure of this book is roughly like this. Overall, this book provides a relatively substantial discussion of all aspects of the National Assembly's historical facts, organization, powers, in a word, theory and system. Each chapter is followed by dozens of footnotes, either providing necessary annotations to the main text or listing the sources of reference materials, all of which demonstrate that the author was quite responsible in writing this book. The writing throughout the book is also very fluent. It is not easy to write such a rigid book and have such un-dry writing. It is only a pity that the name is the opposite of the content and easily attracts people's attention, because the word "discourse" is easily misunderstood to mean "describing without creating," so I hope the author will simply call it "The National Assembly System" or some other more appropriate title. I wonder if the author agrees?

One point we expect from the author is that this book was completed in mid-May of last year, while the decision on the allocation of National Assembly representative quotas was made later. Therefore, some election laws and regulations and technical issues of elections have not been discussed. This point, we can forgive the author, and the author has also said in the postscript that if there is an opportunity for a reprint in the future, it will be added and revised. We feel that this book is very perfect and worthy of attention from the academic community, but in order to make it even more perfect, we hope that a revised edition will be published soon.

### Progressive Education at the Crossroads

— Yang Tongfang

Progressive Education at the Crossroads by Boyd H. Bode.

Translated by Qin Xilian

First edition, October, 36th year, Zhengzhong Book Company

"Progressive Education at the Crossroads" is a famous work of modern educational philosophy. The author, Boyd H. Bode, is a well-known American philosophy professor. His works such as "Fundamentals of Education," "Modern Educational Theories," and "Conflicting Psychology of Learning" have Chinese translations, which were widely circulated for a time. As the name suggests, this book describes various educational thoughts that are hesitating at the crossroads, and the essence of progressive education. The author objectively elaborates on many concepts that have been debated for a long time in educational thought, and points out the new path of education. The book shows us the philosophy on which progressive thought is based. The content of this philosophy, as Bode said, is derived from the meanings of "respect for individuality" and "maximum development" emphasized by the progressive movement.

Progressive education is a philosophical thought and also a movement that is widespread in society. It is based on liberalism and democratic ideals, and grows and takes shape. Its most prominent meaning is "child-centered," which means that it includes the concepts of "interest," "initiative," and "freedom." In terms of psychology, progressive education tends to the principle of "learning by doing." In terms of society, it emphasizes the development of individuality and stresses the value of cooperation and mutual assistance.

The author says in the preface: "If education is to be treated as a valuable vocation for adults, it must be based on a philosophy of social organization." He insists that respect for individuality and maximum development are a fighting doctrine. Bode believes that the practice of progressive education is mainly to make educational activities represent a correct way of life. This view is very correct.

He begins by discussing the relationship between progressive education and democracy. Progressive education respects freedom, but also values guidance; it values methods, but does not rigidly adhere to traditional curricula; it pays attention to the development of individuality, but also values social institutions. Because it values individuality, it is extremely opposed to "imposition." Education should fully develop the individual's ability to use the freedom of intelligence. All traditional beliefs and attitudes that hinder the development of individuality and intelligence must be transformed and revised.

Regarding liberal education and technical education, Bode believes that they are not opposed. The difference between the two is not that the former is solely engaged in the pursuit of truth, while the latter is purely seeking practical results. This implicitly illustrates the harmony between art and profession. It is wrong for technical education to be too inclined to mechanical training; it can also develop students' ability to appreciate. The author says: "When technical education reaches the point where students feel that it includes a whole way of life, it becomes liberalized."

There are many different theories about the theory of interest. The author starts from the psychological standpoint of progressive education. He believes that interest is mostly determined by the environment and is not entirely internal. Effort is related to interest, and the attractiveness of the environment, including the inspiration of teachers and the favorable conditions of a good teaching environment, are all factors in cultivating interest. We often misunderstand interest as an unlimited and vague pandering to likes. After reading Bode's argument, we will also understand that sugar-coated education cannot represent progressive education. The true meaning of interest should be "education becomes a program centered on constantly transforming experience towards a general pattern... It is not obtained by external imposition, but by students using their own intelligence."

In the section "An American Cultural Paradigm," the author says that American culture emphasizes cultivating intelligence rather than obeying authority. This educational system does not recognize certain absolute or final truths, because they limit social progress and the constant transformation and enrichment of experience. Progressive thought and education depend entirely on whether the goals of the entire life of society are in accordance with reciprocal or cooperative relationships. He has two very pertinent sentences: "Our educational theory must become a theory of social relations, or a theory of democracy."

Dr. Dewey had already elaborated on the meaning of "education is growth." Bode further elaborates on the true meaning of this, with the addition of recent research. He uses "education is a program of constantly reorganizing experience" to interpret what growth is and the direction of growth. Growth can refer to the motive power originating entirely from the student internally, or it can refer to the student's satisfactory response to the teacher's suggestions. The author warns teachers not to completely believe in "internal growth" without providing appropriate guidance; nor can they rely entirely on their own prejudices to carry out incorrect "external guidance" and force students to blindly accept.

The author, fearing that teachers in general overemphasize teaching materials and neglect the true meaning of education, puts forward the principle of "teach children, not subjects." He points out how fixed curricula and teaching materials block the development of students' thinking and the growth of their minds. Indeed, teaching materials are only a means, a method, a tool to achieve educational goals; the purpose of education is still to change behavior. Various subjects and teaching materials must truly achieve the purpose of "edification" and shaping character in order to have value. "Traditional education" disregards the child's nature... It assigns homework as a fixed amount of learning material, regardless of the laws or principles of psychological growth. The whole program becomes mechanized, sacrificing spirit or attitude. Yes, being educated and being taught materials are clearly different. The former is the spiritual realization and the change of attitude; the latter is only formal training and external coercion.

Finally, he concludes with a discussion of "the sociality of education." Bode believes that the ideals of progressive education should conform to the ideals of a democratic society. Therefore, a social philosophy that correctly explains social relations becomes something that researchers of education cannot ignore.

The content of this book cannot be said to be very substantial, but it represents a view of progressive education. The translation seems to be slightly lacking in fluency. If a more literal translation method is adopted, it may be more Sinicized and easier to understand the underlying meaning of the ideas. However, translating philosophical books is not easy in the first place. The translator has indeed put in considerable effort, and in order to "strive for accuracy," a literal translation is naturally necessary. I think that people who have a foundation in pedagogy, and who are used to reading English books or translations, will certainly not find it too difficult.

### Elementary School Music Teaching Materials

— Pei Yuan

I remember when I was at the Fujian Conservatory of Music, I often received letters from outside asking for music teaching materials and inquiring about various teaching methods. At that time, I would send out some lecture notes piecemeal, and besides giving some rough answers to teaching difficulties, I would also guide them to find a few books to read. However, during the war, the publishing world, and the few barely usable books that existed, were out of print and unavailable for purchase. In the past two years, I have been traveling in Taiwan and Zhejiang, and have had a lot of contact with music teachers and future music teachers. The need for books in this area has become even more urgent. A month ago, while traveling in Jinhua, I found a book in a bookstore written by Mr. Miao Tianrui called Elementary School Music Teaching Materials and Teaching Methods. Seeing how detailed and innovative this book was written, I was really pleasantly surprised, so I am willing to write to introduce it to music teachers and normal school students across the country:

The text of this book is 113 pages, divided into nine chapters. In the first chapter, "Methods of Selecting Singing Teaching Materials," it is proposed that the lyrics should be colloquial, and that the works of only one or two people should not be sung forever, so as to avoid narrowing the children's musical interests. These are all based on experience. In the third chapter, "Sight-Singing Teaching Method," it is proposed that the method of writing music notation and singing with the finger score are neglected by general teachers. In the fourth chapter, "General Teaching Methods for Singing," it is proposed that seating arrangements should be grouped according to ability, which is extremely helpful for learning and management. In the same chapter, the starting pitch and calling beat are also common problems that general teachers often make. In the fifth chapter, "Vocalization Method and Height Correction Method," it is solemnly pointed out that when children sing, the first priority is to use head voice to sing, sing in a low voice, and develop towards high notes. In elementary schools today, I don't know how many teachers choose songs with very low ranges and teach children to shout desperately, damaging their vocal cords and making it impossible for them to produce beautiful singing for the rest of their lives! In the same chapter, the question of how to sing during the voice change period is raised. Ordinary teachers only know that singing is not suitable during the voice change period, but in schools without instruments or other equipment, children do not sing during the voice change period, and therefore become alienated and unfamiliar with music. Isn't this a great loss? The seventh chapter, "Other Musical Activities," is the material that is most needed in elementary school music teaching and is least mentioned in general music textbooks. In this chapter, the author proposes singing games, musician stories, dictation, concerts, etc. Readers will not find it difficult to draw inferences from one instance to another and gain inspiration for many ways to increase children's interest and learning efficiency! The ninth chapter, "Equipment and Others," has a method for repairing organs, which is the most practical guidance for elementary school teachers. The same chapter also mentions the American music supervision system, which is undoubtedly still a luxury in our country, but I would like to urge the attention of educational administrative authorities to establish such a good system that can help music teachers develop music education in the near future!

In addition, the writing of the whole book is simple and fluent, and there are many singing teaching materials attached, which are also the highlights of this book. The only drawback is that all the explanations and songs use numbered notation. However, friends who have printing experience and know that most elementary school music teachers today can only read numbered notation should not find it difficult to sympathize with the author's words in the preface, "In order to facilitate printing, I have to temporarily use numbered notation" and "If there is an opportunity for a reprint, I will change all the notation to staff notation"!

This publication welcomes submissions, but due to space limitations, each article should be limited to 1,000 characters. Royalties are settled at the end of the month and issued at the beginning of the following month. Inquiries are welcome, but if they are not claimed after three months, it will be considered as automatic waiver of remuneration. We hope you will understand. ——The Editor

### Nikolai Nekrasov

— Shi Pei

Written by Chukovsky, translated by Yu Hongmo, published by Haiyan Bookstore

A person's soul and vitality are strengthened through tempering. The reason why I read biographies is that I can discover this truth in the experiences of others. In times of loneliness, it gives me spiritual support. When I am suffering from constant setbacks, it reaches out a helping hand and makes me climb up again. Because people have a strong instinct to hate mediocrity, and biographies use simple and realistic narratives to allow us to get close to all the most extraordinary people in thousands of years of human history, giving us various spiritual responses, making our lives colorful, and giving our hearts strength. That is the reason for biographies.

The life and works of the great Russian poet Nikolai Nekrasov have been introduced to our country very little until now. Now the publication of his biography is worthy of our reading.

After Pushkin and Lermontov, the great Russian poet was Nikolai Nekrasov. In fact, his status is no less than theirs. Dostoevsky later said in memory of Nikolai Nekrasov: "Nikolai Nekrasov is a poet who can be ranked with Pushkin and Lermontov." His brilliant achievements and the legacy he left in literature have earned him a lofty position. The families of poets, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, have unfortunately been unable to escape the fate of poverty and frustration. However, it is perhaps even more tragic for a poet of such talent and self-encouragement as Nikolai Nekrasov to become a beggar. He was born on December 4, 1821, in Yuzvina, a small county in the Podolia Governorate. His father was a landlord, a retired military officer, who led a dissolute life, addicted to alcohol and gambling, and had a violent temper. In his poems, Nikolai Nekrasov called his father "a stubborn uneducated man," "tyrant," "abuser," and "executioner." His mother was a woman who loved music and literature. Therefore, under the influence of such different parents, Nikolai Nekrasov naturally moved towards hating abuse, resisting violence, and using literature as a tool to express his will. In his youth, he became the "singer of the groans and tears of the masses."

In 1838, at the age of seventeen, he left home for the capital. However, in addition to the manuscript of a novel and some poems, he did not have a single kopeck in his pocket. Entering the literary world with such courage, he ended up with nothing to eat and no place to live, and spent the winter without a coat. Only an indomitable person like him could endure the arduous struggle with extreme poverty.

In the two years of work in 1840 and 1841, he wrote short songs, essays, miscellanies, poems, short stories and novellas, and reviews that could almost be compared with the lifetime creative output of other writers. This achievement is amazing, and from this we can imagine how great his perseverance was in the midst of hardship. Later, he continued to write with the same spirit. In his later years, he recalled his past life and wrote: "Several times I wrote all night without rest, almost without a second's interruption, until my legs became paralyzed and lost feeling. The lights were on, day or night, there was no difference to me. When the time came, I would go and do other work, and then return to this work."

Nikolai Nekrasov's acquaintance with the famous critic Belinsky was the most important turning point in the poet's life. Belinsky supported him with the utmost sincerity, enabling him to abandon his former gorgeous verses and begin to write about the lives of the abused and suffering people. The author of this biography says: "The keynote of his poems, because of the melancholy rhythm, the straightforward crying and weeping, has become a rare curse and complaint. The supple rhythm becomes a constant flow of soothing sounds and words. These poems are almost evidence of the human suffering caused by cold, hunger, oppression, disease, and poverty." This is the true color of Nikolai Nekrasov's poems, but it was all influenced by Belinsky.

Nekrasov bought the publishing rights to the magazine "The Contemporary", which had been created by Pushkin, in his later years, and after that his work was concentrated on editing the magazine. Because of editing this magazine, he cultivated many excellent new writers, such as Dostoevsky, Goncharov, and Tolstoy, all of whom he paved the way for. This is something worth emphasizing. The brave poet, who had struggled for art all his life, died of illness on December 27, 1877.

This biography describes the poet's lifelong struggle and his great achievements. What unfolds before us is the development of a talent for beauty and goodness, the building of a noble personality, and the struggle with circumstances in order to achieve the final purpose of life. Many foreign artists were inspired by reading the biography of Leonardo da Vinci. Now our lives and environment are falling into a state of lethargy and weary melancholy, and we are trying to get out of the bondage of this feeling as soon as possible. At this time, if we read the biographies of others to the point where they have fallen into the same trials as ourselves, we will feel a lot lighter. At the same time, reading about how our admired predecessors have struggled through the period of melancholy can naturally be a kind of warning and encouragement to us. The Nikolai Nekrasov biography is a good biography for us in the struggle against poverty.

### Saying of All Fools

— Why Bother

The Westerners' creation of April Fool's Day likely belongs to the elegant pastimes of the upper classes in Europe and America. Its essence lies in showing off ingenuity and competing in intelligence, similar to Chinese poetic riddles and literary puzzles, although there is a slight difference in the sentiments of Eastern and Western cultures. Since the eastward spread of European customs, April Fool's Day has also been transplanted to China. Especially in recent years, the news pages, whenever April 1st arrives, stimulated by the tense political situation, awaken people's "news brains." Reporters, in order to relax the readers' emotions, often arrange a few "fooling" news items to provide a bit of relief, causing the readers to burst into laughter after being "fooled." Perhaps this is in accordance with the principle of "a balance of tension and relaxation, the way of civil and military affairs," and there is originally nothing wrong with it.

I read the newspapers every day and deeply feel that living in today's China, it would be best if every year was April 1st, so that when we read certain depressing news, we could just consider it the news agency's "fooling" news and feel the comfort that the facts may not be entirely true. Has the four-power agreement on the control of Germany collapsed? No, it's just a fool's message. Does Japan want to follow in Italy's footsteps and demand the return of Okinawa? No, it's "fooling" news broadcast from Tokyo. Things like this are hard to describe. If it were all just playing "fooling" tricks, wouldn't that be the world's fortune? Originally, "life in this world," apart from malicious deception, is also a matter of you deceiving me and me deceiving you, using well-intentioned deception to reduce mutual disputes and maintain a gentlemanly demeanor of kindness. Therefore, even though it is clearly going abroad for pleasure, one insists on saying it is for illness and medical treatment, or to study geography; even though it is clearly a deer, it can be pointed to as a horse; even though one clearly hates the lively play of children, one still scares them with "the tiger is coming to eat the loudest child"... From this point of view, the Westerners who like to play tricks are not as good as the Chinese in their skillful use of "fooling" tactics. They only set a holiday, stipulating that one can only fool people on April 1st, while the Chinese are constantly thinking of using fooling methods to make up for the face of a fallen gentleman, or to achieve a selfish goal. We only see a few "fooling" news items published in the newspaper on April 1st, but we are already numb to the "fooling" words and deeds that are being created at all times, which the Westerners who created April Fool's Day could never have foreseen.

Thinking further, are the April Fool's Day news stories really "fooling" people? Most of the fabricated stories, on the surface, seem to be "fooling" people, but their inherent meaning may represent an intention, a truth. For example, suppose today someone publishes a fooling news item in the newspaper, saying that on April 16th, coins with a fixed value will be issued to replace today's legal tender. This kind of news caters to the readers' psychology and also expresses the general public's desire for a currency with a fixed value. Also, suppose today someone creates a news item saying that a certain movie star committed suicide due to a love affair. This would indeed make those who care about the movie star uneasy, and at the same time, it would use the movie star's appeal to attract readers to take a closer look at the "fooling" report, which in fact illustrates a tragic path for modern lovers.

The people who create fooling news think they are scheming and playing with a colorful pen to fool people, but they don't realize how "smart" they are, because they themselves are in a large circle of a fooling world. And the fooling news that they painstakingly create may not be enough to fool people, but it reveals a bit of natural "divine secrets" in another way—that is, a verse saying:

It is laughable that the fooler,

Is also being fooled by others,

In this vast world,

Fooling others is fooling oneself!

In fact, it is not fooling,

There is truth in it.

Western April Fool's Day,

A small Chinese game.

### Long Live Lies

— Yi Chu

I once saw such a story: A family had a boy, and the whole family was overjoyed. At the one-month celebration, they brought him out for the guests to see, naturally wanting some auspicious omens.

One said: "This child will be rich in the future." He then received a lot of thanks.

Another said: "This child will be an official." He then received a few compliments.

Another said: "This child will die in the future." He then received a beating from everyone.

That the child will die is inevitable and true, but saying it out loud resulted in a beating. As for becoming rich and an official, it is still very uncertain, but these irrelevant and false words, on the contrary, pleased people. The first two guests understood the art of speaking, and they applied it skillfully.

Extending this further: a hypocrite who has five concubines will also scold the world for being depraved and morals for being in decline, and even organize a "Society for Rectifying Customs." A speculative profiteer will also condemn profiteers for having no conscience and demand that the government strictly prohibit them. As for corrupt officials, of course, they say they are the most honest, with clean sleeves and loving the people like their own children. Sometimes—when I haven't shaved for more than a month and am wearing a wrinkled gray cloth gown—if I happen to run into a wealthy friend, before I can even say hello, he starts lamenting his poverty, as if he specifically sought me out to complain. Moreover, judging from his tone, he is so poor that he can barely afford to light a fire at home and needs someone else to help him. Although he doesn't ask me for money, I am so scared that I leave him early. When old maids receive tips from their mistresses, they also hide one hand behind their backs and keep saying, "No, no." But if the other hand doesn't actually come forward to take the money, it must be because they think it's too little. When ladies chat, you hear them say, "Mrs. Zhang is so beautiful, it takes her three hours a day to put on makeup. I'm just so-so." "Mrs. Li has billions of private money, I can't save a penny." It's as if they are complaining that they don't know how to dress up and don't have private money. But in fact, they are telling you: she is naturally beautiful and doesn't need makeup; her husband's money is managed by her, so there's no need to hide it. If you don't "listen to their words and observe their actions" like Confucius, then you will definitely be fooled!

If there is an art to speaking, it is lying.

### "Reimbursement Politics"

— Ping Zhai

I often feel that Chinese bureaucrats have two great skills that foreigners cannot match. These two great skills are: (1) filing reimbursements; (2) making work reports. As for whether orders can be carried out, or whether the "work" has been thoroughly done, these seem to be secondary matters. As long as the reimbursement is filed neatly and the full amount of public funds is received, it is considered that the work has already been promoted; when a large stack of work reports has been completed in a circle from bottom to top, layer by layer, and is covered with dust in a remote corner of a certain official office—well, the "work" has been completed, and the performance evaluation can have a basis.

For lack of a better term, let's call it "reimbursement politics."

The most standard example of "reimbursement politics" is the recent sudden announcement by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau that it would again be holding a city-wide registration of wireless radios, and that the deadline was the end of March. When this matter was first announced, the tone was quite stern. The end of March has already arrived. What is the result of the registration? Yesterday, I ran into an old classmate who has worked in the Telecommunications Bureau for many years, and I asked him what was going on. He couldn't help but laugh and said, "There are quite a few foreigners registered!" As for the Chinese, he said that even the staff of the Telecommunications Bureau themselves mostly ignore it—even the radios of the staff living in the Telecommunications Bureau's dormitory have not been registered.

I laughed too, and asked him, "If you don't register after the end of March, will the Telecommunications Bureau take any action?"

He said, "I'm afraid not."

In fact, if the Telecommunications Bureau were to punish users for failing to register, we would be very willing to hear what legal basis they have. Moreover, what methods does the Telecommunications Bureau have to know that users have failed to register? Send investigators to investigate? Then we would also like to ask: what if I just close the door and don't allow them to come in to investigate? What law does the Telecommunications Bureau have the right to search people's homes? At the beginning of this constitutional government, government agencies should absolutely take the lead in advocating the spirit of abiding by the law!

The people of Shanghai are busy all day long running around for food and clothing. After finishing their public affairs, if they don't gamble or dance, but go home and sit on the sofa to smoke a cigarette and listen to the radio, it can be said to be the most basic enjoyment of being law-abiding. In my opinion, the government should reward this repeatedly. But now they insist on thinking of some unnecessary tricks out of peace and stability to trouble the people. Is it really because they are afraid that they cannot oppress the people!

If today's government wants to wash away the criticism of "incompetence," the first thing to do is to cultivate a down-to-earth and practical work style. As for the matter of wireless radio registration, I think they will first come up with "insufficient processing, extended for one month," and then, after one month, they will come up with "extended for another month," like a theater retaining a famous actor. Probably after two or three extensions of one month, everyone will have gradually forgotten about this matter, and the Telecommunications Bureau will take this opportunity to put away the awning and call it quits—and they can start drafting "work reports" again. Starting with thunderous speed and ending with a whimper, this is the formula for "reimbursement politics," and there are probably not many exceptions. But "reimbursement politics" is precisely the opposite of "a down-to-earth and practical work style." Although the matter of radio registration is small, we can once again clearly see the two big words "incompetence" in it!

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

For "daylight saving time," all clocks must be moved forward one hour; for "youth saving," many ladies slow down the clock of their lives by a few years. — The same kind of saving, the hours and years are inversely proportional, is it because developing new resources and reducing expenditures each have their own merits?

On the street, there are no French parasol trees and lawns, so we can't gather; how can we lack a trash can?

There are people in the world who jump from childhood to old age in one go, never having been young. But there are also people who spend their whole lives living young days.

People who are unreasonable are abnormal madmen; people who are deeply knowledgeable about the world are so well-balanced that they have no human touch. This is what is called it is difficult to be a person, and it is difficult to do things.

Spring orchids, autumn chrysanthemums, summer lotuses, winter plums... each has its glorious days; but the monthly red rose, without a day of beauty, and a moment of splendor.

### Dealing with People and Dealing with Things

— Yun Gong

Any matter in society cannot escape the relationship between people and things. Some people are very strict with their subordinates, but they are sloppy in handling affairs; some people have a consistent strict style in dealing with people and things, their words must be followed, and any delay will be followed by punishment. These people not only inspire awe, but also make people fear them. In my memory, the arithmetic teacher in elementary school who liked to use a teaching whip to "slap the palm" can be regarded as a representative of this type.

Indeed, the relationship between people and things is extremely close, and the two are not easy to separate. Being strict in handling affairs inevitably leads to jealousy or offending people. And those who are all-rounders and get along well with everyone often do things perfunctorily. Therefore, many people who are engaged in business in society often want to find a golden mean between dealing with people and dealing with things, so that they can handle things well and not cause any trouble in personnel matters. This is naturally a very difficult task, because if handled carelessly, it may offend many people and have the opposite result.

Not long ago, I received some inspiration from a publisher. After he handed over the manuscripts to the printing house for typesetting, he agreed on a delivery date and did not allow delays. But usually, if the printing house had a problem with the circulation of funds, he would provide some assistance, using both kindness and power. As a result, all the printing houses were willing to work for him. The method adopted by this gentleman can be summarized as: "Be generous to people and be serious about things." Extending its meaning, he never spoke harshly to the people he contacted on a daily basis, but for a thing, it had to be done well within the specified date. People who knew him well and understood his temper did not dare to delay. I think the eight words mentioned above are at least worth half a textbook on personnel management.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter Thirteen Remediation ()

Zhai also thought that his father was old, his mother was often ill, and his sister was still in Hankou, so he was very uneasy about leaving the old people, and the old people might not agree. If he lied to the old people, saying that the bank sent him out and he would be back in a few days, he would certainly not disapprove of anything. But if he left and never came back, the old people would definitely be uneasy. Zhu Zhai hesitated all day about this matter and could not resolve it. In the evening, he received a letter from Yunxiang. He opened it and saw that it read: "Zhu: I have been thinking about what you said today for a long time, and all the circumstances do not allow it. My will, I have thoroughly expressed to you the night before yesterday, and it will never waver. I do not want you to be frustrated for me and delay your future. After thinking again and again, the only thing is for you to go home, and in the midst of great disappointment, you can still get a trace of comfort. Your spirit should be placed in your career and reputation, not like before, immersed in the sea of love. You have always listened to me, this is my last contribution, I think you must adopt it. I have already written a letter to Fengsheng, I think you will be able to get Fengsheng's understanding when you go home. In this way, you will get comfort, your parents will get comfort, and I will get comfort too. Qing." After Zhu Zhai finished reading this letter, he frowned and said to himself, "Round and round, it is still this idea. If I don't go, I will disappoint her kindness, if I go, it really has no meaning." He took this letter and walked around the room, thinking for a long time before he decided that if he didn't go, Yun Qing would blame him, so he might as well go. If Fengsheng has any more signs of rejection, I will have more material to report to Yun Qing. Once Zhu Zhai had made up his mind, he immediately put on his clothes, went out to hire a car, and immediately rushed to Beixinqiao. When he arrived at the door, he saw that the gate was ajar, so he gently pushed it open and went in. Walking into the courtyard, he just met Fengsheng, who was holding a teapot and coming out of the house. When he saw Zhu Zhai, he asked loudly, "What are you doing here?" Zhu Zhai was very aggrieved in his heart. Seeing Fengsheng's attitude, he wanted to turn around and leave, but then he thought that this matter was originally my fault to her, and it is right for me to be angry with her today. With this thought, he smiled at Fengsheng and walked into the house. Fengsheng still had a stern face, sent the teapot into the kitchen, and walked out again. Zhu Zhai stood in the house with a smiling face to greet her, but Fengsheng ignored him and walked straight into the inner room.
