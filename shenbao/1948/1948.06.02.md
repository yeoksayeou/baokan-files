### The First Joint Conference of the Executive Yuan Under Constitutional Rule Sets Forth Policy Guidelines to be Presented to the Legislative Yuan; Weng Wenhao Encourages Colleagues to Share the Heavy Responsibility

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] After the appointment and announcement of the heads of various ministries and commissions of the first Executive Yuan under constitutional rule, most of them took office on the 1st and held the first political affairs meeting at the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM to discuss the new Executive Yuan's policy guidelines. The meeting was chaired by Weng Wenhao, who first delivered a speech outlining his views on the future policy of the Executive Yuan. Attending committee members and attendees Wang Yunwu, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, He Yingqin, Yu Hongjun, and others spoke separately, offering opinions on administrative reform, believing that a firm decision should be made to overcome difficulties and weather the crisis. Some pointed out that the current task should be to unite the military under political leadership to stabilize social order, and that the formulation of policy guidelines should be simple and concise, explaining only the important aspects, without listing the work of each department, which would only make them verbose and impractical. After discussion, it was decided that the heads of the departments responsible for actual work should submit written opinions within three days, to be compiled by the Premier to draft the overall policy guidelines, and then attend the Legislative Yuan to report. Secondly, Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun also reported on the foreign exchange settlement methods and implementation process. Wang Yunwu explained the current financial difficulties, stating that he was appointed to head the Ministry of Finance and hoped for guidance and advice from all parties. Finally, the meeting discussed the rules of procedure for the Executive Yuan meetings. Because the Executive Yuan's organizational law differed in spirit from the previous organizational law, the current Executive Yuan's organization is based on a supervisory system, so the proceedings should be revised in accordance with this spirit, and the revision was approved after discussion. The first meeting adjourned at about 1:00 PM. All attending committee members were present either in person or by representative, except for the two ministers of the Youth Party and the two political commissars Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yang Yongjun, and Zheng Zhenwen, who were absent due to reasons, and Vice Premier Gu Mengyu and political commissar Dong Xian Guang, who had not yet returned to Nanjing to attend. In the afternoon, most of the re-elected ministers went to their offices as usual. The newly appointed Minister of Food Guan Jiyu and Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu separately consulted with their predecessors Yu Feipeng and Yu Hongjun to discuss handover matters and had not yet reported to their departments to take up their new posts.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] At the first political affairs meeting of the Executive Yuan today, Premier Weng encouraged his colleagues to share the difficulties of the times, jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility, so as to turn danger into safety and lay the foundation for constitutional government. Premier Weng pointed out that the current responsibility is to implement constitutional rule and suppress the rebellion. The people of the whole country and friendly countries around the world have high expectations for our government, and he hoped that everyone could be of one mind and jointly shoulder this major responsibility, cultivate a spirit of proactive progress, and open up a brighter future for the entire country. However, the Communist Party, disregarding national interests, recklessly engages in destruction and slaughter, resulting in people's livelihood being in dire straits and an unprecedented disaster. In the future, we must take the people's food, clothing, housing, and transportation as our daily goals, earnestly plan and earnestly implement, in order to save the current hardship. He continued that the US donation and loan to help our recovery must be deeply self-encouraging, and sincerely discuss with the US personnel handling aid to China, give play to the spirit of self-help and self-reliance, in order to repay the good intentions of friendly countries in assisting and supporting us. Finally, Weng expressed his hope to discuss and formulate policy guidelines as soon as possible, so as to submit a report to the Legislative Yuan, and also hoped that the Youth Party colleagues would take office as soon as possible, and that the Democratic Socialist Party could still participate in government cooperation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Executive Yuan has successively appointed Jiang Yuntian and Peng Xuepei as consultants to the Executive Yuan. In addition, the Executive Yuan's political affairs meetings, which are routinely held every Tuesday, have been changed to every Wednesday due to a conflict with the scheduled time of the Legislative Yuan's regular meetings.

### The Sixth Meeting of the Legislative Yuan Passes a Resolution to Establish a Special Committee for US Aid, Investigate the Capital of Powerful Families, and Submit Research Methods to the Finance and Banking Committee; Three Articles of the Organizational Law are Amended

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Sixth Meeting of the First Session of the First Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 1st. Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan reported that President Sun was absent on official business and requested the attending committee members to mutually elect one person to serve as chairman. Cheng Tianfang was elected by the assembly to serve as chairman. First, the minutes of the previous meeting were approved. Then, Secretary-General Zhang reported that a joint meeting of the conveners of various committees would be held on the 2nd to discuss "their own affairs" of the Legislative Yuan, and reporters were not allowed to attend. Then, the matters for discussion were carried out in the order prescribed by the agenda.

The first case was the report by Cheng Tianfang, Chen Guyuan, and Zheng Yanfen on sorting out Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law. After Chen Guyuan's explanation, after some textual discussion by the assembly, it was still passed according to the original proposal (see another article). The second case was the proposal by Hao Yaodong and others "to determine the closing date of this session and plan to complete important work before the closing." The third case was the proposal by Chen Mingxian and others "to improve the work efficiency of this session of the Legislative Yuan." As a result of the discussion, Yin Shuxian's suggestion was passed, that these two cases cannot be made into laws, and there is no need to make a resolution. Relevant committees should pay attention to them, and the speaking committee members are requested to save meeting time.

The fourth case was the special review committee's proposal to establish a program committee, a special committee for investigating the capital of powerful families, and a special committee for US aid. The special review committee's report on the program committee was: "A program committee shall be established, but it is not necessary to stipulate it in the organizational law. The members of this committee may be appointed by one member from each standing committee. Meetings shall be convened at any time when procedural issues arise." After the proposer Zhang Huiwen's explanation, it was accepted by the assembly and passed without objection. As for the establishment of the special committee for investigating the capital of powerful families, after the proposer Feng Junlian's explanation, it encountered opposition from a majority of the committee members, who unanimously believed that the capital of powerful families should indeed be investigated, settled, eliminated, and prevented, but the establishment of a committee may harm legislation due to procedural delays, which is not necessary. Finally, with the approval of 299 people (out of 410 people present), Guo Dengao's suggestion was passed, that a special committee is not necessary, and the relevant matters for handling the capital of powerful families shall be submitted to the Finance and Banking Committee for research methods, and relevant laws and regulations shall be drafted. The meeting adjourned at 12:00.

The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, still chaired by Cheng Tianfang, to continue discussing the fourth case of establishing a special committee for US aid. After the proposer Qiu Hanping explained the necessity of establishing the special committee, both sides started a debate. Lai Lian, Pan Chaoying, Liu Zhendong, Xu Panyun, Pan Yanxing, Pan Lianfang, and others supported the establishment, believing that US aid is very important to the current domestic situation, financial stability will rely on it, production and construction will rely on it for development, and US aid is a debt, which increases the burden on the people, and the parliament should intervene. The Legislative Yuan should set up a special committee to be responsible for paying attention to research. Ni Yujie, Tao Rong, Yu Zheng, and others believed that the implementation of US aid utilization is in the Executive Yuan, and supervision is in the Control Yuan. The Legislative Yuan should trust the government so that it can do things freely. Finally, the vote was passed with the approval of 160 people (out of 301 people present) to establish a special committee for US aid, and then its organization was discussed, and it was decided that all committee members could participate freely.

### The Provincial and County Autonomy General Rules Case Will Be Discussed Again at the Next Meeting

The fifth case was the draft of the Provincial and County Autonomy General Rules proposed by Lv Fusuo. After Lv explained that his draft was prepared using an open doctrine, several committee members paid for the review. Xiao Zheng raised a procedural issue, in addition to accusing the secretariat of failing to deliver the agenda to each committee member two days in advance in accordance with Article 20 of the rules of procedure, he also said: This important bill should not be rushed, and all committee members have not conducted prior research, and cannot rashly pass it as a first reading and pay for the review. He advocated postponing it to the next meeting for discussion, which was passed by the assembly without objection. Wang Kaihua also suggested that the secretariat should request the draft previously drafted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs for reference.

### The Case of Preventing Aiding Japan is First Submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee for Review

After a break at 5:20, the chairman reported that Li Yunliang and others had submitted an emergency proposal: "Please ask the government to take urgent measures to prevent all actions that promote Japan's military and economic power, and be vigilant about the possible serious crisis caused by the US Dyle Plan." After seeking the consent of the assembly, the agenda was changed to conduct the discussion. After the rapporteur read out the full text of the proposal and Li's explanation, Liu Baimin, Meng Yunqiao, Chen Ruxuan, and others all believed that the case was not very urgent, but an ordinary diplomatic case, and advocated that it should be submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review first. This opinion was passed by a vote of 250 people (out of 304 people present). The meeting was adjourned at about 6:00 PM, and the cases were not discussed, leaving them for discussion at the next meeting.

### Air Force Covers Nationalist Troops Outside Jinan, Counterattacks Along Both Sides of the Jinpu Railway, Recovering Haozhai and Yanglou in Xuzhou's Peaceful Surroundings

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 1st Dispatch] Starting at 9 AM today, Nationalist troops outside Jinan, under the cover of the Air Force, began counterattacking towards Tai'an along both sides of the Jinpu Railway. By noon, they had crossed Sunjiayu, a key point south of Wande, and were continuing their advance. Nationalist troop strength at Dakou on the southern route has been reinforced, and they are firmly defending its northern key point, Yunfeng Mountain. Three bandit columns that crossed the Yellow River fled to the southeastern area of Yuncheng on the 31st, and Nationalist troops are currently encircling and attacking them.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 1st Dispatch] The 7th Column, among the four bandit columns that invaded the central section of the Jinpu Railway, was counterattacked by Nationalist troops at Sunjiayu, south of Wande, at noon today. The New 8th Column is moving from Tai'an towards Dakou, and the main force of the 13th Column fled from Tai'an's Xiwulongkou to Dakou starting on the evening of the 31st, where telecommunications were cut off on the 1st. The New 11th Column remains based near Feicheng, and the 9th Column is based in Shouguang. The area outside Jinan is still calm. Nationalist troops on the eastern route have automatically withdrawn west from Mingshui to Longshan to ensure the safety of Jinan. According to general assessments, the focus of the war has shifted to the area outside Yanzhou due to the southward flight of the bandit's 13th and New 8th Columns and the flight of three columns that crossed the Yellow River to the southeast of Yuncheng.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 1st Dispatch] It is reported that the bandits fleeing to the southeast of Yuncheng are Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns, who are continuing to press towards the outer perimeter of Yanzhou.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 1st Dispatch] The bandits who harassed the area near Jiahezhai (8 kilometers west of Xuzhou) and Haozhai and Yanglou were routed westward by Nationalist troops at 3 AM today.

The Jinpu Railway between Lincheng and Guanqiao has been severely damaged by bandits and is being repaired. The bandits who invaded Caocun have retreated west, and Xushi and Anjing are normal.

Editorial

### Key Points for Revising Trade Management Measures

After the announcement of the "Measures for Using Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates," we raised several doubts about the management of import and export trade, especially regarding quota allocation, the foreign exchange issue of importers concurrently operating exports, and the issue of importing goods with self-provided foreign exchange. We believed that these issues needed careful consideration and adjustment. Recently, the improvement of trade control has attracted widespread attention, and the Export Control Committee is discussing specific measures, which are expected to be realized soon. Regarding these revised measures, we would like to reiterate our views for reference.

First, regarding the quota system, it is said that the revised measures still intend to maintain it. However, how the quotas and allocation standards will be revised has not yet been revealed. In addition to announcing the quotas as circumstances change, rather than making rigid regulations, it is a well-known fact that the quotas were too tight in the past and the allocation to various regions was not entirely reasonable. Since importers are now responsible for negotiating and purchasing foreign exchange from exporters, and the Central Bank no longer supplies it, in principle, exports can be encouraged as much as possible, and overseas remittances and self-provided foreign exchange can be absorbed as much as possible for supply. It is not necessary to tighten the quotas too much to alleviate the serious situation of work stoppages, production reductions, and factory migration to the south.

Second, Appendix 1, namely the part on production equipment, is said to be largely or entirely opened up, allowing imports to be purchased with self-provided foreign exchange. This was originally something that the central government had been considering for two years, and it is something that everyone has been eagerly awaiting. We should support it and hope that it will be realized soon. Because many factories are limited by import restrictions for the machines and parts they need and cannot replenish them, they have no choice but to partially shut down, which hinders production. It is said that the reason for setting up factories in Hong Kong is also because the machines and components that they need cannot be imported. This naturally becomes a legitimate reason for them to use as an excuse. If production equipment is allowed to be imported freely with self-provided foreign exchange without being subject to current regulations, the difficulties of manufacturers in various regions can be resolved, and the trend of factories moving south may also be alleviated. This is naturally much better than the rigid, stopgap measure of banning the export of cotton spindles promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, there are also various types of production equipment: some are for manufacturing daily necessities for people's livelihoods, and some are of a relatively less important nature; some can use local materials to develop the use of native goods, and some have few raw materials and must rely on foreign goods; some industries have a slightly thicker foundation, and the current supply can barely be maintained, and some have too few substitutes and cannot be self-sufficient without foreign goods. For the sake of maximizing benefits and effectively utilizing planned economy, it seems necessary to distinguish and select so-called production equipment. Especially when the raw materials produced domestically are too few and most of them need foreign assistance, it is worth considering whether they should be treated equally and not be selected for, especially in today's context, when foreign exchange resources are clearly limited. Because the more this equipment is imported, the more the need for foreign raw materials in the future and the foreign exchange that needs to be imported will inevitably increase. This is probably not the most ideal solution!

Third, other than purchasing production equipment for import, there has been no news about self-provided foreign exchange. We believe that regardless of overseas remittances or foreign exchange from exports, in addition to using it according to the "Measures for Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates," the owners should also retain a portion and be allowed to handle the import of goods themselves after obtaining an import permit to encourage them. That is, in addition to allowing self-provided foreign exchange to be used to purchase production equipment, if they voluntarily handle the import of goods, they only need to apply in advance and obtain permission, and there is no need to discriminate against them, causing suspicion and obstruction. Now that foreign exchange funds are so scarce and the expansion of export business may not be as satisfactory as desired, and there are so many savings of Chinese people escaping abroad and foreign exchange from overseas Chinese flowing into Hong Kong, then, under the premise of not hindering foreign exchange management and trade management, everything may as well be relaxed to attract more people so that the funds that have escaped can return to the country and engage in production.

Some people are worried that if goods are allowed to be imported at the same time as production equipment, this fund will be put into consumer goods, and this is not without reason. However, since the import permit system has not been abolished, consumer goods cannot be imported freely, and the right to approve or disapprove still rests with the Export Control Committee. As long as they are reviewed in accordance with the law and smuggling is strengthened at any time, these concerns are really unfounded. If favoritism is shown and imports are allowed illegally, or the efficiency of anti-smuggling is too low to prevent smuggling, then it is obviously not a legislative issue.

In short, it is a recognized fact that trade management measures must be revised, and for the sake of intensifying the promotion of exports and absorbing all foreign exchange funds, we also believe that the newly established foreign exchange settlement certificate measures need to be supplemented again.

### Professor Zhao Naibu Speaks Freely on Two Major Issues of Land Reform

System and technology are two sides of the same coin when it comes to land problems. The system is a matter of land rights, and technology is a matter of utilization. Without improving the system, it is difficult to seek progress in technology. Without progress in technology, even if the system is changed, it will not help improve people's livelihoods. In China, since the Qin and Han dynasties, almost every dynasty, at the time of rise and fall, had a set of land policies that emerged as their political capital. Unfortunately, the results of the attempts have never been completely successful. All reforms were either abandoned halfway or simply could not be implemented. Dong Zhongshu, He Wu, Kong Guang and others of the Han Dynasty first advocated the "land limitation" policy, but it was just empty talk and was not implemented. Wang Mang established the "Royal Land" system, intending to reform the system of private land ownership, but its implementation for less than three years led to the phenomenon of "treacherous officials and cunning people invading together, and the masses of people living in unrest for a long time" and failed completely. The land grant policy of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties had the slightest intention of equalizing land and limiting land, but it was difficult to verify the dispersal of households, the forced sales by powerful people were extremely fierce, and coupled with the lack of diligent implementation, it ultimately achieved little effect. In the early Tang Dynasty, the system of inheriting household shares was adopted, supplemented by the Rent, Labor, and Tax System. Although nominally claiming to be equalization of land, land rights were not actually equal. The land limitation law was adopted in the Song Dynasty, but it was not prohibited by law to mortgage and sublease, so the actual amount exceeded by much. Wang Anshi's land policy aimed to support owner-farmers. On the one hand, the square field taxation method was adopted to prevent large landlords from evading taxes. On the other hand, the Green Sprouts Law was adopted to provide owner-farmers with financial accommodation. The legislation was not bad to begin with, but it ultimately failed due to difficulties in obstruction. The land system of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties was extremely chaotic, and the trend of annexation was even more rampant. The so-called royal land, limited land, permanent land, and single whip methods were only temporary remedies, and it was difficult to implement them for a long time. Looking at the land policies of the past dynasties, they were limited to institutional reforms and had very little technological progress. Therefore, land reform became a cyclical evolution of systems, without any technological metabolism. Moreover, the motivation for land reform in the past was to suppress the rich and help the poor, and there was a lack of clear awareness of the technical aspects of production. Therefore, the reason for its failure lies in the disconnection between politics and economics.

The institutional issue of land reform is the issue of land rights.

Review of Land Rights

Belongs to the category of distribution. Distribution can be discussed in two aspects: one is the distribution of land itself, and the other is the distribution of agricultural products. The former discusses land ownership, and the latter discusses land rent. Regarding the distribution of land nationwide, there are two different statistics: one indicates that the degree of land concentration in China is not too high; the other indicates that the degree of land concentration in China is quite serious. However, we must understand that the concentration of land distribution sometimes only indicates the concentration of property, and does not necessarily indicate the concentration of agricultural production and management. In other words, the existence of large landlords does not necessarily mean the operation of large farms. Due to the concentration of land property, it has caused serious problems in social distribution. Due to the scattered use of land, it has created serious problems in economic production. Therefore, China's land problem has been subjected to this double pressure, and it is very difficult to seek reform. Because of the concentration of land property and the scattered use, various land rent systems have been created, which generally include three major types: labor rent, in-kind rent, and cash rent. The existence of this tenancy relationship may have different opinions on the impact on production efficiency, but there is no doubt that the excessive fragmentation of the farm area hinders the scientific methods of machine production.

The distribution of land

Can be divided into two meanings: absolute equality and relative equality. Absolute equality uses population as the standard, which is simple and easy to understand. As for relative equality, it uses labor as the standard, which is complicated and difficult to implement. Using labor as the standard for land distribution can well match production. If population is used as the standard for land distribution, it may not be able to make the land be used rationally. If we can achieve absolute equality in the distribution of land, it is indeed a moral ideal. However, the absolute equality of land distribution is still far from the economic ideal in China's situation. According to experts' research, the land most suitable for utilization should be below 500 meters in altitude, but this type of land only accounts for 14% of China's terrain. Those above 500 meters and below 1,000 meters can be used reluctantly, and this type of land only accounts for 18%. The total of the two is only 32%. Some say that the area of cultivated land in China is about 1.3 billion mu, and if it is averaged by the agricultural population of 320 million, each person can get about 4 mu. According to the living standards of European and American people, each person needs 16 mu of land to be sufficient for one person's living materials. Now Chinese farmers only get 4 mu, which is a huge difference. Therefore, even if the distribution of land can achieve absolute equality, it is only a victory for the sense of justice. To seek the ideal economic standard, we still have to work harder.

Not only is the land available for utilization so scarce, we will further analyze China's land reclamation index, which is even more pitiful. The so-called

Reclamation Index

Refers to the percentage of cultivated land area to the total land area. If the index is high (the percentage is high), it means that the degree of reclamation is high, and there is more cultivated land. Conversely, a low index indicates a small degree of reclamation and less cultivated land. Or please, China's land reclamation index is only 13%, and the population density is quite high. From this, it can be proved that there is not much land in China that can be used, and there is even less cultivated land. Is the flattery of "vast land and abundant resources" not a great irony? The haggardness of people's livelihoods can be imagined. I humbly examine that the reason why the reclamation index is low is nothing more than two reasons, namely the shrinking of cultivated land and the increase of wasteland. The shrinking of cultivated land has absolute and relative explanations: the direct shrinking of cultivated land due to turmoil or other reasons is called the absolute explanation, and the rough cultivation due to lack of funds is called the relative explanation. As for the increase of wasteland, either the land that can be utilized is not fully utilized, or the land that has been utilized is used to grow opium. Moreover, there is much wasteland in the border areas, much wasteland in the coastal areas, and much wasteland in the valleys. Or it is wasted due to exorbitant taxes, or it is wasted due to frequent civil wars. The decline in land production is indeed a serious problem for the current people's economy.

The reform of the land rights system must use political and social forces; improving technology must rely on the application of scientific methods and the promotion of economic facilities. The former contains revolutionary actions, while the latter must adopt the principles of evolution. I believe that the biggest goal of land reform should be

The welfare of the whole people

Thinking, to improve the material happiness of the people, we must increase production to maximize the use of land. To maximize the use of land, scientific methods must be adopted, and the scale of production must be expanded. Therefore, the tenancy relationship in the past must be abolished. Once the tenancy relationship is abolished, the transfer of ownership is inevitable. To achieve this goal, the use of financial processes can avoid the tragic fate of bloody revolution. I believe that the two major principles of "equal land rights" and "land to the tiller" refer to the right to use land rather than the ownership of land in the application of the transition period: because land is a natural gift, endowed with exclusive scarcity, it should belong to the state, which is the most ideal. I believe that the issue of land reform really includes too many factors. To sum up, the analysis is as follows: (1) System problem (ownership): 1 Social justice; 2 Political revolution; (2) Technical problem (land use): 1 Economic construction; 2 Scientific application.

Land reform must take a two-pronged approach to the land rights system and the technology of utilization to succeed, because after the tiller has his own land, he will definitely need production funds and production technology, just like having a soul but no shell, there is nothing to attach to, having a shell but no soul, it must become waste. I hope to adopt a bloodless political revolution to achieve social justice. I hope to adopt scientific methods to complete economic construction. Only in this way can we live up to the mission of land reform.

### Strengthening the Coastal Defense of Zhapu

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng

[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper, 1st] At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Japan was unable to break through our strong Shanghai defenses. Instead, it exploited gaps, landing between Jin Sun Niang Bridge and Quan Gong Ting between Shanghai and Hangzhou, leading to the abandonment of Pinghu and the retreat of the Shanghai soldiers. Opening a map of China, from Jinshanwei in Jiangsu to Jin Sun Niang Bridge, Baisha Bay, Quan Gong Ting, Dushan, Zhapu, Ganpu area of Zhejiang, are all on the northern coast of the Qiantang River, opposite Yuyao. Zhapu and Ganpu are the locations of the Oriental Great Port planned by the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen.

Iron Sand Beach

Easy to Land

This coastline, extending over forty li, is indeed of great importance, because the beach here is iron sand. One only needs to use a light sail to glide onto any part of the beach to disembark. From Yuyao to the Zhapu area, if one encounters a favorable tidal wind, it takes only three hours to drift over. During regular high tides, it takes six hours to cross. If this coastline is occupied, the entire southern region of the Yangtze River will be severely impacted.

During the late Qing Dynasty, great attention was paid to this area, and many forts were built. Towards the end of the Qing Dynasty, the Catholic Church's She Shan Hall came to Zhapu to purchase land. In the early years of the Republic, Sun Yat-sen strongly advocated the construction of the Oriental Great Port, and Catholics came here to buy land and build houses. At that time, Lu Yongxiang, the Military Governor of Zhejiang, considered this a strategic area and negotiated with foreigners for its return in twenty years. The Catholic believers insisted on a sixty-year lease. Later, internal wars broke out frequently, and the land rights were not recovered. In the years 1932 and 1933, the Zhejiang Provincial Government proposed developing it into a scenic area, with Huangshan as the main area, and the Shanyang beach as a seaside resort, which caused the price of mountainous land to rise from a dozen yuan per mu to over three hundred or even a thousand yuan. In 1935 and 1936, the government designated it as a fortified restricted area, and from then on, tourists disappeared, and it became a military zone. After the victory of the War of Resistance, this area became desolate and dilapidated. Although the government still designated Zhapu as a fortified area, it was clearly not fortified and was openly opened.

Three County Lines

Mutual Communication

Recently, uneasy news has come from the Siming Mountains across the river in Yuyao. Rumors on Baisha Beach and Hu Island suggest that hundreds of people are planning to land in the direction of Zhapu. For this reason, this reporter spoke with Wang Shaozeng, the County Magistrate of Jinshan, and Fan Wenzhi, the County Magistrate of Pinghu. They informed me that a landing is currently impossible. They have police teams and regular troops stationed at every stronghold from Jinshanwei onwards. Recently, youth troops have also come to assist, and the Zhejiang Water Police has also sent a company to be stationed. In the inland of the coastline, there are also some regular troops and police teams deployed for support. Pinghu County is only thirteen kilometers away from Zhapu, and Pinghu and Jinshan have three county lines that can communicate with each other. The two county magistrates said to my face, "We must act as supporting arms and dependent lips and teeth." However, according to the two county magistrates, it would be best to have a warship patrolling the coastline of over forty li from time to time to ensure safety.

Huang Bamei

Managing Huangshan

The reporter found the famous Huang Bamei (Huang Baiqi) from the War of Resistance era in Zhapu. She was busy greeting foreign guests in Huangshan. Her chubby face was full of smiles, and her thick black eyebrows revealed a happy expression. Her idea is that while building bunkers in important places, the government should actively cultivate civilian strength. She said that there should be no problem in the Zhapu area. She accompanied me on a tour of the mountains. She has already retired from the military and is now engaged in business. There is the Huangshan Guest House on the mountain, which she opened, and she is still building some houses to rent to foreign friends. She pointed out to me a mountain called Gaogong Mountain and another called Yunding Mountain. It is said that Emperor Qinshihuang practiced swordsmanship on Gaogong Mountain, and used his sword to cut off the top of Yunding Mountain, and the top of the mountain was cut into the sea. We saw a small island in the sea, with waves surging towards it. On the beach, the vast sandy beach, looking out to the endless sea, makes one feel refreshed.

Building Thatched Cottages

Foreign Guests Flock In

Not far from the beach, at the foot of the mountain, are rows of simple thatched cottages. It is said that there are three hundred and eighteen thatched cottages here, with a rental period of one summer season, and the rent is about five or six shi of white rice. Most of the people who come here to stay are foreigners. They do not mind the simplicity and live a weekend life. They all enjoy swimming in the sea. According to Ms. Huang Baiqi, "Some women lie on the beach sunbathing, and their skin peels off, but they still sunbathe." When we toured, we saw pairs of couples, dressed in bright colors, dotting the green mountains, like fluttering butterflies and wild roses in bloom, truly beautiful.

Climbing the mountain, there is also a "Little Putuo Temple", with guest rooms overlooking the vast sea and surging waves. Reaching the beach, crossing the sea to the isolated island in the sea, called "Zhongputuo", where the forests are lush and the scenery is natural. It is said that the old monk in the mountain is very good at swimming and can stay underwater for three hours.

Summer Resort

Enhancing Construction

Now, people in the Zhapu area see strengthening coastal defense and developing Huangshan as equally important, because Huangshan is a summer resort, and the increase in foreign tourists can attract more investment and enhance construction. The Pinghu County Government wants to apply to the Provincial Government for a loan of 2 billion to build scenic spots, to be returned in two months. If the Provincial Government can lend 2 billion to Pinghu, it will undoubtedly attract more tourists. I believe that if there are more tourists and more investment in the Zhapu area, the local area will naturally benefit, and this will also arouse everyone's deeper attention to public security and coastal defense.

### Where Did Over 12,000 Shi of Grain from Jurong Go?

[Report from Jurong by this newspaper, May 29th] Originally, the figure for this year's loan was 15 shi per bao, of which 12 shi from last year's loan, plus interest of 10%, or 1 shi and 20 jin, should be deducted, totaling 13 shi and 20 jin. The actual loan was only 180 jin. In order to understand the truth about this grain loan, this reporter visited County Magistrate Chen on the 28th to inquire about the situation. He explained in detail, saying, "According to the reports from the heads of various granaries today, the amount of grain that should be stored is 22,293 shi, and the actual amount stored is 9,593 shi, of which reserve grain accounts for 8,979 shi, and county-level public grain only accounts for 614 shi. The most alarming thing is that the former County Magistrate Qi Min owes 127,000 shi. Today (the 28th), I have specifically ordered Fang Tingdong, who was responsible for the handover during the tenure of the former County Magistrate Shi, to hand over all the outstanding amounts clearly in order to resolve the current serious crises of 'public', 'education', and 'agriculture'." The County Council held an emergency meeting and, in addition to sending telegrams to relevant government offices in the province to call for a thorough investigation, Vice Director Zhou of the Provincial Office was put in charge of strictly ordering the former County Magistrate Shi to return the grain before further investigating his responsibility.

### Israel Unconditionally Accepts Ceasefire Proposal of the Security Council; Arab League Has Not Yet Responded

[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 1st Broadcast: Washington Report, a UN official spokesperson said that the State of Israel has accepted the UN's proposed four-week ceasefire in Palestine and a simultaneous ban on arms shipments to the Middle East, without any conditions attached. It is expected that a note will be submitted to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie before the deadline of 7:00 PM tonight. The UN is currently awaiting a response from the Arab nations. If the Arab side accepts this plan, Palestine will have at least four weeks of peace, during which a general embargo will be implemented, and the UN will seek a more permanent solution to the Arab-Jewish dispute.

[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 1st Broadcast: Lake Success Reportedly, Israel's response included "explanations." If the "explanations" have the significance of "reservations", difficulties may arise in the Security Council.

[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 1st Broadcast: Lake Success Reportedly, representatives from Egypt and Syria said that as of now, they have not received any responses from their respective governments regarding the UN's proposed four-week ceasefire plan for Palestine, nor are there any signs that they will. However, some instructions may be received this afternoon.

[Reuters, London, 1st] Arab and Jewish leaders met today in Amman, the capital of Transjordan, and Tel Aviv, the Jewish capital, respectively, to prepare responses to the Security Council's Palestine ceasefire resolution. The response is required to reach the Security Council before 11:00 PM standard time on the 1st (8:00 AM Shanghai summer time on the 2nd). Reports from Amman said that four of the five major Arab powers had drafted a response after holding an informal meeting, which would be finalized after Egyptian Foreign Minister Khashaba arrived in Amman from Cairo. Reports from Cairo said that the Arab response might be to accept the Security Council's ceasefire resolution. Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy told reporters after convening a cabinet meeting: "The Arab Allied Forces have won a victory, and the terms of this ceasefire are better than the first one. We should not insist too much." The Jewish response is not expected to be submitted until shortly before the deadline. There is a feeling in Tel Aviv that UN mediator Count Bernadotte's visit there yesterday may have softened the Jewish stance, but Bernadotte himself said he was neither optimistic nor pessimistic.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 31st] There is a growing belief here today that the Security Council will not agree on punitive steps against Arabs and Jews if they refuse to lay down their arms. Therefore, the recent UN ceasefire plan for Palestine has been shaken by this belief. UN officials fear that both sides will ignore the Security Council's call for a four-week ceasefire and an arms embargo to the Middle East. If one side refuses to cease fire by 11:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on June 1st, the Security Council will begin debating on the 2nd what steps to take against the violating party. Currently, both sides believe that the agreement that is difficult to achieve in the Security Council will turn into disagreement again when the representatives discuss stronger measures to stop the war.

### Holy Land Mediator Bernadotte Negotiates Ceasefire with Arabs and Jews; Visited Shertok and Azzam Separately

[Reuters, London, 31st] British Foreign Office officials believe that the resolution of various details during the ceasefire period will be handled by UN mediator Count Folke Bernadotte. Although the British government has drafted a plan for a permanent solution to the Palestine problem, this work must be initiated by Bernadotte.

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 1st Broadcast: UN Palestine mediator Bernadotte left Haifa for Amman today. Arab political leaders are currently drafting a response to the Security Council in Amman.

[Reuters, London, 31st] UN Palestine mediator Count Folke Bernadotte suddenly began establishing contacts with both the Jewish and Arab sides 24 hours before the deadline for accepting the Security Council's ceasefire order.

After arriving in Haifa from Cairo this morning, he immediately drove to Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, to visit Foreign Minister Shertok, and then returned to Haifa, where his entourage continued to meet with the Jewish side. He himself took a Red Cross special plane directly to Amman, the capital of Transjordan, to meet with Arab League Secretary-General Azzam, but observers believe that the meeting was of little consequence.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 31st] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam told UN Palestine mediator Count Folke Bernadotte last night that the Arab countries are determined to eliminate the State of Israel. Azzam claimed at a press conference today that he was alone with Bernadotte during the meeting, and the Count had recorded his words. Azzam hopes that the Count can succeed based on the principles he stated.

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 1st] The Israeli Provisional Council met tonight to hear Foreign Minister Shertok report on his negotiations with UN Palestine truce mediator Bernadotte. Shertok and Bernadotte had been negotiating for almost the entire afternoon, but it is not yet known whether Shertok made any suggestions or what the government's attitude is.

### Iraqi Army Officially Announces That It Has Surrounded Tel Aviv; Jewish Planes Suddenly Bomb the Capital of Transjordan

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 1st Broadcast: Iraqi ground forces occupied the Jewish city of Kafr Yona today.

### US Publishes Guidance Plan for Factories to Switch to Wartime Production

[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] The Armed Forces Munitions Board appealed to private industry on the 31st to begin its own plans, preparing to mobilize quickly in the event of an atomic war. The board's director, Haggerty, released a 46-page guidance chart to help authorities at every factory in the United States prepare methods of production now for any eventuality in the future. He solemnly pointed out that the plan does not mean that there will be a war in the near future, but said, "When the atomic bombs begin to drop, there will be no time to start planning again. We must do it now. Preparation is the basis of peace. A vigilant country that is prepared for events in the military and industrial fields has the best chance of avoiding such events." Haggerty added that if private industry can prepare its own advance plans, it can save three to six months of "precious time" in future mobilization.

### US Republican Primaries Held Separately in Two States

[United Press International, Washington, 31st] The selection of 1,094 Republican National Convention delegates will be completed after the two-state primary elections held on the 1st, and the three-state convention to be held on the 11th. One primary election is in California and the other in South Dakota. The state convention is held in Indiana. California will have 53 delegates supporting Governor Warren, South Dakota is expected to have 11 supporting Stassen, and Indiana has a total of 29 delegates. With only three weeks left until the Republican National Convention on June 21, based on the number of delegates pledged to each candidate, the number of delegates possessed by each Republican presidential candidate is: Dewey 128, Taft 74, Stassen 62, Baldwin 19, MacArthur 8.

Dewey, Stassen, and Taft all have far more delegates than the numbers mentioned above. Spokesmen for Dewey and Taft each claimed that their presidential candidates could win at least 300 votes in the first ballot. Stassen's campaign headquarters claimed that he could get 340 votes in the first ballot and another 200 votes in the second ballot. However, this claim seems exaggerated. According to the rules of the Republican National Convention, each presidential candidate only needs a simple majority to be elected as a presidential nominee, and this year's simple majority is 548 votes.

### Columbia River Levee Breaks, US Flood Disaster Unprecedentedly Severe, US and Canadian Authorities Strive for Rescue Efforts

[United Press International, Washington, 31st] President Truman today declared the flood-stricken areas of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho as disaster areas and ordered the use of wartime surplus materials for relief. The American Red Cross has allocated $52,000 to the disaster area.

[Associated Press, Portland, Oregon, 1st] The US Pacific Northwest coast and Canada are tonight struggling to resist the floodwaters of the Columbia River. Upstream areas have been damaged, but the flood continues to surge downstream to densely populated areas. The total loss is impossible to estimate. According to the Red Cross, the number of victims has reached 45,000 and approximately 10,000 homes have been destroyed.

[Associated Press, Portland, Oregon, 1st] Another levee on the Columbia River north of Portland broke late on the 31st, and the river flooded, rushing towards the Portland racetrack worth $1.5 million. Fortunately, residents in this new disaster area had been evacuated in advance, and 800 horses were also moved from the stables. At the same time, 5,000 residents in two cities in southwestern Washington State have abandoned their homes due to the threat of flooding. The disaster situation downstream of the Columbia River is unprecedentedly severe, and residents along the levee for 120 miles from near Portland to the Pacific Ocean have all been ordered to evacuate. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, except for able-bodied men and troops engaged in levee protection work, the rest have been evacuated. The Columbia River and its downstream tributaries continue to rise, and all 1,000 residents of Woodley, 30 miles north of Portland, have evacuated to safe locations. Approximately 4,000 residents of Kelso, Washington, have fled from the lower part of the city. The Cowlitz River is also rising, and 9,000 residents are working hard with the help of a team to try to protect their homes in the danger zone. The 30-foot-high head of the Columbia River is still hours away, but parts of the coasts of Washington and Bradlon have been flooded. More than 300 miles to the north, in British Columbia, Canada, the Fraser River also breached in one place, isolating 2,000 residents of Matsqui and Rosedale from the outside world. Premier Johnson has declared a state of emergency in the disaster area and authorized the Canadian Army to deploy troops if necessary.

### Australian Government Opposes Japanese Immigration to Pacific Islands

### British Cabinet Implements Partial Reorganization, Dalton Re-enters Cabinet to Assist Prime Minister in Handling Special Affairs

[Reuters, London, 31st] It was officially announced that former Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton has re-entered the Cabinet, succeeding Lord Pakenham as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. (Note: Dalton was forced to resign last year for leaking the budget.) Lord Pakenham has been transferred to the post of Minister of Civil Aviation, succeeding the resigning Lord Nathan. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is like a minister without portfolio, not responsible for any specific department, but assists the Cabinet in its general work and may be ordered by the Prime Minister to perform special duties at any time.

The position was originally not a member of the Cabinet, but after Dalton's appointment, Dalton will serve as a member of the Cabinet. When Lord Pakenham held the position, he was responsible for the affairs of the British occupied zones of Germany and Austria. Now that the affairs of the occupied zones of Germany and Austria have been transferred to Foreign Secretary Bevin for general responsibility, they will no longer be Dalton's task. The annual salary of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was originally £3,000, but since Dalton is a member of the Cabinet, his annual salary is £5,000. Prime Minister Attlee intends to assign Dalton to any kind of duty, but it has not yet been decided. It is said that the economic affairs currently handled by Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps will not be changed for the time being. After Dalton enters the Cabinet, the number of Cabinet members has increased from 17 to 18.

### Executive Yuan Allocates Funds for Permanent Flood Control Project, Public Works Bureau Aims to Start Construction in Mid-July and Complete It in Six Months, Funding for Dike Project in Jiangsu Province Also Approved, Allocating 200 Billion

[Report from our newspaper] According to reliable information obtained by reporters yesterday from relevant parties: the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling US Aid to China Relief Supplies has approved the allocation of US$320,000 for the city's permanent flood control project. The funds are extracted from the proceeds from the sale of US relief rice, which, converted at the previous exchange rate, is approximately 100 billion national currency, and will be allocated in installments. The first installment of 15 billion yuan was allocated to the city government in May, the second installment of 40 billion yuan will be allocated this month, and the third installment of 45 billion yuan will be issued after construction begins. The Seawall Engineering Committee of the Public Works Bureau is scheduled to conduct public bidding within the month. In order to prevent price increases of construction materials, all the funds from the first installment will be used to purchase materials first. This large-scale flood control project is scheduled to start construction in mid-July and will be completed within six months.

It is understood that the city's seawalls, bounded by the Huangpu River, are divided into east and west dikes. The east dike is 15.26 kilometers long and the west dike is 16.62 kilometers long. Due to the impact of the war, they have been in disrepair for many years, and have been eroded by seawater, resulting in numerous breaches. After the restoration, the Public Works Bureau realized that the situation was very critical and decided to carry out emergency repairs first. Since the winter of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), measurement work has been carried out. In the spring of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), the city government allocated funds, and the Executive Headquarters provided trucks to start construction and first repaired more than ten breaches south of the seaside bath. In the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), the Executive Yuan was requested to allocate 1 billion yuan in funding. By the end of May of this year, the preliminary revetment project had been completed one after another, totaling more than 60 billion yuan.

Good News Arrives, City Government Pleased

The city government, considering that the dredging of the seawalls and the protection of the beach and revetment are equally important, and that the previous construction was purely emergency repairs, which were only temporary measures. To ensure the safety of the dike, the construction of the beach protection project is still needed to achieve a permanent solution. The Public Works Bureau was instructed to quickly formulate a specific plan for the flood control project and wait for the opportunity to implement it. The Seawall Engineering Committee rushed to complete it at the end of last lunar year. Starting this spring, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Structural Department, traveled tirelessly on the Nanjing-Shanghai route to fully promote its implementation. At that time, although the Executive Yuan considered the flood control project to be extremely important, it was unable to bear the cost of such a large-scale project due to the government's economic difficulties. Later, due to the smooth distribution and sale of US relief rice in China, it was approved to allocate funds from the proceeds from the sale of rice. The Ministry of Water Resources will allocate the first installment of funds. When the good news arrived a few days ago, the city government was very pleased, and the Public Works Bureau is currently busy preparing for the seawall project.

The Project is Divided into Four Parts

According to reporter inquiries: the permanent flood control and beach protection project is divided into the following four parts: (1) New reinforced concrete retaining wall project, 1,000 meters long. (2) Renovation of pile and stone seawall project, 2,000 meters long. (3) Repair of old rubble retaining wall and rubble beach protection project, more than 1,000 meters long. (4) Construction of twelve bamboo drainage arrows for the dike protection. It is reported that after the completion of the permanent flood control project, the city will be free from the threat of seawater flooding, and the people of Shanghai can rest easy from now on.

Establish Supervisory Committee

[Another report] The total funding of 200 billion yuan for the Jiangsu Province seawall project (including Baoshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Songjiang areas) has also been approved by the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling US Relief Supplies. Among them, 30 billion yuan has been allocated and construction started on May 27. In addition, the Jiangsu and Shanghai City Seawall Project Responsible Bureau, in order to ensure the proper management and use of funds, has established the Jiangsu-Shanghai Seawall Project Relief Fund Supervisory Committee, with Zhang Jia'ao as the chairman, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Xu Kai of the Ministry of Water Resources, and Dong Zanyao, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, serving as standing committee members.

### Speaker Urges Citizens to Reflect on US Support for Japan, Do Not Just Criticize, Should Rely on Self-Reliance

City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan issued a statement yesterday on the issue of US support for Japan, advocating that the United States should focus on strengthening aid to China as the core of its Far East policy. The general idea is: In the current environment, instead of merely criticizing the United States for supporting Japan, we should first strive to reinvigorate ourselves, unite, and exert the power of total war to quell the communist rebellion as soon as possible, so that our country can become a major stabilizing force in the Far East. Our policy towards Japan has always been magnanimous, but it has its limits. If the United States single-mindedly supports Japan, causing the Japanese militarists and zaibatsu to attempt to take the opportunity to rise again, it will inevitably be opposed by us, and at the same time, we, as a member of the Allied forces, have the right to appeal to the United States at this time. However, we also have something to reflect on, that is, before and after the War of Resistance, the United States originally intended to actively support our country and make it a stabilizing force in the Far East. Unfortunately, in the past two years, the communist bandits have rebelled and resorted to armed force to seize power, causing the domestic political and economic situation to deteriorate, and the international status has also been greatly affected. The "anti-American" movement that is generally seen today is also secretly instigated by these traitors who use force to harm the country. US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, said in his speech commemorating US Memorial Day: "Those who shout the slogans of anti-American and pro-Japanese in China today have obviously forgotten that China's most affluent Northeast Nine Provinces are struggling to survive in the clutches of new imperialists. This statement is enough to alert the people of the country. At present, the United States occupies and controls Japan and must support Japan's post-war economy, which is about to collapse. It is a heavy burden. Therefore, it may not be unforgivable to allow the Japanese economy to recover slightly in order to reduce the US economic burden on Japan, but from a long-term perspective, we must also point out that some people in the United States, if they are paralyzed by flattery from Japan and excessively support Japan, will eventually form a dangerous policy, and will eventually suffer the consequences. I still remember that when Japan was undergoing the Meiji Restoration, Britain had single-handedly supported it, and the United States followed suit, but Japan still rejected Britain and the United States, which eventually led to the Pearl Harbor incident. Therefore, I deeply hope that far-sighted politicians in the United States can face reality, look to the future, recognize the crisis, and not repeat the mistakes. Moreover, China and the United States have a long history of friendship. If the United States wants to maintain world peace, it can only stabilize the Far East by strengthening aid to China. At the same time, I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will not just criticize the United States for supporting Japan, but must rely on self-reliance, strive to quell the rebellion and build the country, so that we can become a stabilizing force in the Far East.

### Upper Court Tears Down Manga, Invites All Sectors to Inspect Today, Reveal Conspiracy Truth

[Report from our newspaper] According to the Shanghai Municipal Government Information Office yesterday: a group of professional students at the Shanghai Law School on Jiangwan Road launched an exhibition of current affairs cartoons to celebrate the inauguration of the new president, Chu Fengyi, and the 20th anniversary of the appointment of Qian Xin as a member of the school board. This deeply dissatisfied the majority of students at the school, resulting in a melee. In addition to the professional students who hosted the cartoon exhibition and the perpetrators of the beating being transferred to the Special Court by the Police Bureau for investigation, the authorities decided to invite university presidents, executive directors of the Municipal Education Association, speakers and secretaries-general of the Municipal Council, the press, and responsible persons of relevant groups to a public viewing in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 4:00 pm today to clarify the truth, in order to make all sectors of society understand the conspiracy of a small number of professional students at the Shanghai Law School being instigated by the communist party. Examples of cartoons that were torn down by patriotic students at the school at the time include: depicting "the President and Vice President walking towards Yuan Shikai's tomb," "the Chinese Emperor kneeling to the Americans to present the New Twenty-One Demands," and other posters and various reactionary slogans.

### Authorities Clarify Index Issues, Prices Adopted are Averages, High or Low Does Not Depend on Number of Items

Since the release of the employee cost of living index last month, some workers in the city have found suspicion about the compilation of the worker index, believing that: (1) The May index increased by 29% compared to April, and anyone's intuition feels that the price increase in May far exceeded 29%. (2) The worker index has been declining month by month. The reason is that the percentage of rice in the worker index is heavier than the employee index, and the employee index includes items such as silk, wool, movies, and fruits, while the worker index lacks all of these items. In fact, these items are also necessary for workers' lives. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, made a statement to the Dagong Daily reporter yesterday, explaining that: (1) The prices used to compile the index are the average prices for each month, not the prices at the end of the month. When prices are rising sharply, the price increase at the end of the month is often greater than the average increase, and most people's intuition is based on the end-of-month percentage, which leads to the misunderstanding that the index is inaccurate. (2) The cost of living index is a weighted average of various prices. The prices of various goods in each month have risen very high, while the prices of some goods have risen very little. If the price increase of an item is not high, its weight is larger, and the index increase rate will be reduced, but when this item increases sharply, the index increase rate will definitely increase. We should not suspect it based on the situation in the past one or two months. (3) The index compilation method is based on objective facts obtained from worker family budget surveys, which have been sorted and analyzed. The selected item weights and average household size have their scientific basis and cannot be changed arbitrarily. (4) The level of the index does not depend on the number of items. A large number of items does not necessarily mean a high index, and a small number of items does not necessarily mean a low index. For example, the employee index has more items, but the May index is still lower than the worker index. (5) From the standpoint of the index, the employee index should not be lower than the worker index. The reason why it is currently lower is entirely due to the fact that the price fluctuations of various goods are not equal to the base period. Therefore, if the prices of various items return to normal, there should be no difference between employees and workers. The moderate increase in workers' cost of living is a symbol of prices gradually returning to normal. (6) In fact, although the worker index increased by a percentage lower than the employee cost of living, the reason is that the worker index in April was higher. If we observe the degree of increase based on the base period, the worker index is still 11,000 times higher than the employee index.

Trade Union Explains that the Index is Accurate

Yesterday, reports stated that various trade unions expressed dissatisfaction with the May index and that the compilation method should be considered. A reporter from Dagong Daily specifically visited Zhang Zhusan, the person in charge of the Cost of Living Index Research Association of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, to inquire about the actual situation of the compilation of the worker cost of living index in May. According to Zhang: (1) The compilation of the index by the Federation of Trade Unions is based entirely on the weekly retail prices provided by the survey communication network of each trade union. This original form cannot be changed by anyone, and the trade union can check it at any time. (2) The formula and units for calculating the index by the Federation of Trade Unions are all handled in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Statistical Office. (3) The rice, oil, coal, and sugar in the worker cost of living index are calculated based on the allocation price of the Food Bureau. (4) The price of goods in May was in a state of decline in the third week, so when calculating the index, the average price of the increase and decrease must be used as the basis. (5) The rent in the index is based on the 7,000 to 9,000 times passed by the Municipal Council, and no one has the right to change it. (6) The reason why the employee index has a higher rate of increase than the worker index is due to the different living standards and consumer goods, and no one can deliberately lower it. Zhang also said, "The statistical index is an extremely scientific work. I sincerely hope that all trade unions can study the original prices of various items, and they will know that it is accurate."

The Garrison Command's Investigation Department received a secret report a month ago, learning that Zhang Nu, "Lieutenant General," the deputy commander of the communist army, was recently ordered to come to Shanghai to plan the destruction of warehouses, promote student movements, and obtain intelligence. With the approval of Commander Xuan, Zhang Nu was arrested on the evening of the 12th of last month. After strict interrogation, Xu Jiemin, the person in charge of the communist Shanghai Liaison Station, Fan Zhengchang, the deputy director of the communist Shanghai Liaison Station, Liu Yiqiu, the major general director of the Communist Military Central China Region Intelligence Service stationed in Nanjing and Shanghai, Fang Shilin, who was in charge of student movement work, as well as Zhu Yintian, Yang Xuedao, Zhu Yinqi, Tang Zhenbing, and other 14 people were arrested. They are still being interrogated by the Garrison Command and will be transferred to the Special Court for strict handling within days.

### Maintaining Over Two Hundred Orphans, Bethany Seeks Donations to Expand Site and Build New House

Since its establishment six years ago, the Bethany Orphanage has accommodated more than 200 orphans. Recently, due to the issue of property ownership, the other party notified them to relocate within a limited time. Reverend Qian Tuan, the person in charge of Bethany, was quite discouraged by this blow. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life generally believed that Reverend Qian had achieved remarkable results in handling the education and upbringing of orphans over the years. If it were to suddenly stop because of this, it would be a pity. Moreover, the problem would be even more serious if more than 200 orphans were displaced. Therefore, they all expressed sympathy for Bethany's situation and were willing to provide all assistance to ensure that this well-established childcare undertaking would not be interrupted. Encouraged by all parties, the Bethany Standing Committee has resolved by the Board of Directors to expand the site and build a new house. It will launch a fundraising campaign from all walks of life starting today, with a tentative target of 150 billion yuan, for a period of one month, and has entrusted the city's major newspapers to collect donations on its behalf, hoping to achieve the planned goal within a similar period.

### Goods Needed for Public Utilities Should Adopt Preferential Exchange Settlement Methods: President Yu Expresses Principal Acceptability to Speaker's Proposal

[Our Newspaper] Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council visited the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Yu Hongjun, at the Central Bank on the morning of May 31 to exchange views on the government's improvement of foreign exchange management and the adoption of the foreign exchange settlement certificate method.

According to what Speaker Pan told reporters at the Municipal Council yesterday: the content of the discussion focused on the foreign exchange issues required by various public utilities. Speaker Pan said: People cannot survive without water and fire. Public utilities are not only the source of water and fire needed for people's daily lives, but also the driving force of general industrial production. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in major cities, so the cost of public utilities has a great impact on the cost of general industrial manufactured goods and the people's livelihood. Its importance is no less than that of raw materials for food and clothing such as rice, wheat, fertilizer, and cotton. In order to stabilize the prices of food and clothing, the government has stipulated in the implementation measures for the foreign exchange settlement certificate that for the import of rice, wheat, flour, feed, cotton, and other purposes approved by the government, a settlement certificate must be paid. In other words, the import of the above-mentioned items is still supplied with foreign exchange by the Central Bank at the official exchange rate, which can avoid the loss of independently purchasing foreign exchange at a premium, thereby reducing costs. I believe that in order to achieve the expected effect of the new foreign exchange policy in stabilizing prices, the machines, gasoline, diesel, and chemicals used by water plants, etc., that are required by various public utilities to be ordered from abroad should also adopt the same preferential treatment methods as rice, wheat, and flour. This suggestion does not conflict with the new policy promulgated by the government, because the implementation measures for the foreign exchange settlement certificate stipulate that items approved by the government for use can enjoy foreign exchange supplied by the Central Bank.

Speaker Pan also said: Governor Yu stated that the above suggestion is acceptable in principle, but the implementation method must be discussed in detail with relevant parties and approved by the government before it can be announced and implemented. At the Fifth General Assembly, this council had previously decided to recommend that the government adopt effective measures to fundamentally stabilize prices in order to alleviate people's suffering and stabilize people's hearts, and to set a fairly stable allocation or exchange settlement price for the materials and fuels necessary for various public utilities within three months in order to reduce the factors of price increases in the business. However, the government has not yet adopted and implemented it. The Public Utilities Investigation Committee of this council has decided to petition the central competent ministries on this issue. Now that the government's foreign exchange policy has undergone new changes, I will report the results of yesterday's discussion with Governor Yu to this council. If it is approved by a majority, this new suggestion will be used as the basis for regular talks with the Central Bank, and then formally make specific suggestions to the government, in order to reduce the factors of price increases in public utilities and stabilize prices.

### Wu Kaixian Hosts People from the Industrial Sector to Discuss the Establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association

Director Wu said in his speech that the Ministry of Social Affairs hoped to establish the Municipal Industrial Association in May of this year, but so far only thirty-eight industrial trade associations in the city have completed the reorganization. In order to comply with the order of the Ministry of Social Affairs to prepare for establishment as soon as possible, the Social Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of Article 51 of the Industrial Association Law, has designated a number of units as initiators. Based on the qualifications, history, and capabilities of the leaders of various industries, a total of forty-nine people, including Du Yuesheng, Wu Yunju, Liu Hongsheng, Shu Yunzhang, Hu Xiyuan, Hu Boxiang, Tian Heqing, and Guo Yongxi, have been designated to serve as preparatory committee members. Therefore, today's tea party is also a meeting of all the initiators of the Municipal Industrial Association.

Tasks of the Preparatory Committee

The tasks that the Social Affairs Bureau hopes the preparatory committee will undertake are: (1) to investigate the detailed situation of the same industry factories in the district, (2) to raise preparatory funds, (3) to formulate standards for paying membership fees and annual dues, (4) to determine the date of the establishment conference, which must not be later than two months after the establishment, (5) to review the qualifications of representatives attending the establishment conference, and (6) to draft the articles of association.

Afterwards, Li Shiheng, Section Chief of the Ministry of Social Affairs, who came to Shanghai to guide the preparations, said in his speech: Shanghai's industry accounts for 70% of the country's total. He deeply hoped that the organization of the Municipal Industrial Association this time could serve as a model for the whole country, and that when the National Federation of Industries is organized in the future, the Shanghai Industrial Association will also be the center. Speaker Pan said in his speech that he hoped that after the establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association, it would be able to exert the new power of cooperation and unity to overcome this difficult period. Chairman Fang of the Kuomintang said: Heaven helps those who help themselves. The industrial sector should step up its efforts to unite and improve production so that the allied countries can recognize that our country is working hard and thus provide more assistance to China. At the same time, he also hoped that the government after the implementation of the constitution can truly understand the current difficulties of the industrial sector and help it solve them.

Opening of the Preparatory Meeting

The tea party convened by Director Wu came to an end. The first plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Industrial Association was held.

### "False Phoenix and Empty Dragon" to Produce English Copy, Dubbing to Be Completed Next Week, To Be Transported to England and America for Public Screening

[Our Newspaper] The film "False Phoenix and Empty Dragon", which once caused a sensation due to the "rectification" dispute of barbers, set the highest box office record for domestic films last year. Therefore, it aroused the strong interest of British and American film authorities, who repeatedly wrote to Wenhua Company, requesting that the film be produced in an English copy and transported to England and America for screening. Wenhua believes that this move is a pioneering initiative for domestic films. In order to show its solemnity, the film's director Huang Zuolin first translated the original lyrics into an English dialogue book and brought it to London at the beginning of the year along with the original Mandarin copy of the film to solicit opinions from all parties in the United Kingdom. As a result, it won unanimous praise, believing that the joys and sorrows of men and women produced by the chaotic times in the plot, and the internal sense of humor, will definitely be widely accepted by British and American people. They especially praised the English translation of the dialogue as a vivid work, so they suggested that instead of adding English subtitles, it would be easier to arouse the interest of British and American audiences to produce an English copy. At this point, Wenhua officially decided to give it a try. Huang Zuolin was still in charge of the matter, and the English film title was set as "The Barber Takes a Wife." Four people with profound English and stage experience were hired to start dubbing in April. The shots of the original film were not cut, only the pronunciation part was completely replaced. Up to now, only the music part needs to be completed, and it is expected to be completed entirely within the next week. After a domestic trial screening, it will be transported to the United States first, and then to England for public screening in sequence.

Dubbing Cast

As for the dubbing cast, Miss Li Suiyin played Fan Ruhua in the film, Ma Jiaxun played "No. 3", Kuba played "No. 7", and Huang Zuolin's wife, Danny, played Chen Guofang. Among them, Li is a Cantonese and a sports athlete at Shanghai Sports Academy. Ma is currently a reporter for the English-language Dagong Evening News and once starred in the English drama "Wang Baochuan" in Tianjin. Gu also participated in stage plays in the United States. Danny was Huang's classmate at Cambridge University in England when he was studying drama. The four have excellent English and stage experience. This time, they are assigned to dub the four leading roles in the film. Under Huang's guidance for a month, they have worked hard to study the tone, pronunciation, and emotions, so the final performance is extremely outstanding. Currently, there are also two films, "Six Records of a Floating Life" and "Butterfly Dream", that will also be produced in English-dubbed copies after "False Phoenix and Empty Dragon", so in the future, domestic film art will surely be able to shine brightly abroad due to the continuous export.

### Ward Chief and Ward Secretary Suspected of Embezzlement

[Our Newspaper] Ward Chief Zhang Juyang and Ward Secretary Zhang Yilun of the Eighth Ward in Yangshupu District were secretly reported by the ward residents for falsely reporting household registrations, fraudulently claiming ration cards, and suspected of colluding in embezzlement. After Zheng Guanying, the supervisor sent by the Civil Affairs Bureau, went to conduct a secret investigation, he found two points of suspicion: (1) According to the statistics for April, there were a total of 4,029 people in the ward, with 33 people reporting in and 1,270 people reporting out. It is highly suspicious why the household registration changes are so drastic. After investigation, it was found that Zhang Yilun was transferred to the District Office on April 8. Fearing that the matter would be revealed, he reported a large number of previously falsely reported household registrations. (2) For the rice certificates issued by the District Branch Office, because Zhang Yilun was transferred away, there were 1,079 more large-port rice tickets and 24 more small-port tickets, for a total of 1,103 more. The Civil Affairs Bureau, believing that Zhang Juyang and Zhang Yilun were jointly suspected of embezzlement, transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation yesterday.

After two hours of searching, they were found in the garbage pile on the drying platform on the third floor of the conversation room. It was also found that the check issued by the photo studio had incomplete seals and insufficient funds, so it was not only guilty of privately operating a black market for gold and cash, but also had a serious suspicion of fraud.

### The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Stops Selling, Cancels Price Limits - Rice Sales Return to Free Trade - Market Transactions are Normal, Indica and Japonica Varieties Both Weaken

[Our Newspaper's Report] In coordination with the overall financial and economic policy, the government's sale of rice, originally supplied in both the northern and southern markets, has been stopped as of yesterday, and free trade has been restored, with price limits canceled. Market transactions have returned to normal, and over-the-counter transactions have disappeared. Yesterday, the rice market reported a weakening of rice prices from the producing areas, due to the limited adjustment of the comprehensive rice allocation price for June, coupled with the impact of the inability to use checks on that day, resulting in tight money and a weakening of public confidence. Therefore, the asking prices generally fell, with each variety decreasing by about 100,000 compared to the previous day.

Ren Xianqun, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee, inspected the northern and southern rice markets yesterday morning. According to him, the market response was quite good after the adjustment of the rice allocation price for June to 500,000 yuan per 15 shi jin. Since the market price has stabilized, government supply is unnecessary, and he agreed with Mayor Wu to stop the supply, open up price limits, and restore free purchase and sale. He deeply hopes that this will dredge the source and stabilize grain prices.

Flour prices have fallen sharply due to the decline in rice prices and the tight money situation after checks were disallowed. In addition, the new wheat from various places is entering the market one after another, and those holding goods cannot help but soften their stance, with many having the intention of selling off. Bingchuan flour fell to 1.96 million, within 2 million. Lao Che retreated to 2 million, a decrease of 900,000. Hongfeng and Jiancheng decreased by 100,000 to 130,000 yuan, and the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reduced the selling price of flour by 30,000 yuan, offering it at 2 million, but there were no buyers. Bran was a small amount of 10,000 yuan, and wheat opened at 2.8 million, a decrease of 100,000 yuan.

Due to fellow traders feeling that the silver has been extremely tight after checks were disallowed and that customer demand had waned, the trading of miscellaneous grains was sparse. High-quality soybeans were stable, with high-quality broad beans at 3.3 million yuan at the original price and mid-grade goods at 3.2 million yuan. Corn sales decreased, falling by more than 200,000. Red sorghum has not yet opened, the price of new Yuan wheat has dropped by more than 150,000 yuan, and mung beans have fallen. The price of new Qingbai silkworm cocoons has fallen by 50,000 yuan, and sesame from Tianjin has a way out, so the price is reported to be stable and firm. Because the payment for raw peanuts has not been resolved, they have not opened.

Edible oil prices have seen both increases and decreases. Soybean oil has fallen while vegetable oil has remained firm. Qingdao Jiton vegetable oil is 18 million, and Jiangbei Jiton vegetable oil is up by 300,000 yuan, mainly because the arrival of goods is scarce and the prices at the producing areas are high. The price of soybean oil has fallen because the prices of all grains have fallen and public confidence is weak, with many retail investors spitting out their holdings. The price of Dayou soybean oil is 14.3 million yuan, and Changde soybean oil is 14.1 million yuan, each down by 600,000 to 700,000. Raw rapeseed oil and refined oil have all fallen, but Xiaojun sesame oil has risen by 500,000 yuan due to Tianjin traders. Although Shantou traders did not take much soybean cake, it ultimately fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Peace Fists," represented by Jardine Matheson & Co., arrived in Shanghai from the United States yesterday, transporting 1,500 tons of foreign rice, totaling 33,400 bags, from San Francisco.

### Designated Banks Held a General Meeting Yesterday - Discussing New Exchange Settlement Methods - Four Opinions on Circular No. 134

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Association of Designated Banks held a general meeting of its members at the Bank of China Building yesterday afternoon at 3 pm to discuss and resolve the technical problems caused by the new exchange settlement method. More than 30 representatives from designated banks, both Chinese and foreign, attended the meeting, with Span Shan, a representative from HSBC, serving as chairman. Deputy Governor Liu Gongyun and Deputy Director Shao Zhenhua attended to provide guidance.

After the meeting began, Central Bank Circular No. 134 was read and discussed in detail, article by article. When there were opinions, Liu Gongyun would explain them. As a result of the discussion, the meeting proposed four points: (1) Certificates of foreign exchange settlement for foreign exchange should be allowed to circulate and be traded freely. (2) Article 25 of the Circular stipulates that the daily foreign exchange balance of designated banks shall not exceed US$1,000, which is considered too strict. It is hoped that it will be raised to US$5,000. (3) Article 3 of the Circular stipulates that exporters must declare the quality, quantity, and foreign exchange value of goods to the designated bank. Only after confirming that there are no errors can the procedures be processed. According to this, this is a normal procedure for customs, and designated banks should not be responsible for it. The designated bank is responsible for the accuracy of credit. (4) The Central Bank should authorize designated banks to issue special exchange settlement certificates under certain circumstances. Liu Gongyun expressed acceptance of the first three points on the spot, and they will be revised after the method is completed. The fourth point is still under consideration. The meeting ended at 5:30 pm.

Remittance Issues Unresolved

The overseas remittance issue panel continued to meet, with representatives from nine banks, including Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Citibank, Chung Hing Bank, Postal Savings, Holland Bank, and China South Bank, participating.

Due to time constraints, no conclusion was reached, and it was decided to hold another meeting today to continue the discussion.

Further news: Central Bank Deputy Director Shao Zhenhua told reporters yesterday that as of the day before yesterday, no exchange settlement certificates have been issued or traded.

Regarding the price of exchange settlement certificates, Shao said that it is up to the import and export traders to freely decide through supply and demand relationships. In the future, foreign exchange brokers will only have the responsibility of facilitating transactions.

Central Bank Explains Meaning of Clauses

### Chengxi Spring Cocoons Hit the Market - 26 Million Per Dan

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 1st Day] This year's spring cocoons have appeared on the market, and various silk cocoon trading houses have decided to open and collect cocoons on the 3rd.

### Prohibition of Check Redemption - Market Response is Good

[Our Newspaper's Report] The method of prohibiting same-day check redemption has been implemented since yesterday.

Responsible personnel from the Gold Control Bureau indicated in the evening that the market response was good, and the number of check exchanges had decreased by nearly 60% compared to normal days, and the number of bounced checks had also decreased proportionally. The prohibition of same-day check redemption has more advantages than disadvantages. Customers with good credit can still enter into contracts with banks. This method will overcome difficulties and be strictly implemented, and bad checks will be severely punished. If there is a check returned from a redemption contract, the responsibility lies with the bank.

### The Shanghai Stock Market Turned Positive at the Close - Government Bonds and Unified Bonds Were All Weak

Zhenjiang

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 1st Day] The Provincial Field and Grain Office believes that the grain source is gradually smooth, and rice prices in Su and Xi have also fallen back, but the rice price in Zhenjiang has risen to 7.2 million yuan, which is obviously price gouging by grain merchants, which is extremely hateful.

[Our Newspaper, Mingguang, 1st Day] New wheat in this county has hit the market, with top-quality wheat selling for 5 million yuan and Paulownia wheat selling for 4 million yuan.

### The Export Management Committee Will Announce Today - Methods to Improve Trade Control

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the implementation of the exchange settlement certificate system, the pig bristle industry has already applied for exchange settlement with a designated bank yesterday. However, the certificate obtained by the household has not been sold because there is no target for absorption. Although the official trading of the certificate has not yet opened, it is rumored that the shout price in the market is between 500,000 and 600,000 yuan in national currency per US dollar. After adding the foreign exchange rate of 474,000 yuan, the total is about 1 million yuan, which is slightly lower than the black market, but the difference is not too far, so the situation of China's export industry today is bound to improve. The Export Management Committee continued to meet yesterday to discuss the new trade policy in the future and may announce it today. It is generally speculated that the import quota in the future will also be relaxed, and foreign exchange with own funds will be opened conditionally in order to import production equipment in large quantities. The government will reduce the number of foreign exchange supplied at market prices and hope to increase imports by increasing exports to meet the needs of the industrial and import sectors.

### The Yarn and Cloth Market is Consistently Weak

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by tight monetary conditions and considerable public hesitation due to the prohibition of same-day check redemption. Transactions were scarce, and the market trend was soft. 42-count blue-printed fine yarn fell by 10 million as soon as it opened. Later, due to sporadic purchases by customers, it recovered by about 3 million. When the industry was close to the close, the funds were tight, and they began to sell off. Customers and retail investors also came to resell, and the situation fell to 288.8 million yuan, a decrease of 12 million yuan from the previous day. The other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 5.6 million to 10 million.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a lot of selling by the industry, but customers entered the market when prices were low. The dyeing factories supplied the textile construction county brand, and there was little movement in the market. The market trend was tortuous and downstream. The morning opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was a small increase of 150,000 yuan, at 6.75 million. Later, due to the fact that the cloth stores sold a lot, the market fell again to 6.58 million yuan. Near the close, it was heard that remittances from North China had arrived in Shanghai, and the North traders took advantage of the small gains, and since the yarn price was stable, the price rose to 6.64 million yuan to compensate for the floating air, and the closing price continued to fall by 260,000 yuan compared with the previous day. Other fine cloth, fine twill cloth, gray cloth, bleached cloth, and serge-colored cloth, linsey-woolsey, and other fabrics all fell sharply.

### All Classes at Yingshi University Have Resumed - Professor Xu Deyuan Reports in Hangzhou - The Truth About the Dispute Between the Jin and Liang Schools

[Our Newspaper, Jinhua, 1st Day] All students at Yingshi University resumed classes today.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st Day] Because of an unfortunate incident between students from National Yingshi University and the Provincial Jinhua Middle School, Professor Xu Desha, Zhuo Ru, Director Nie Shiqi, and others were specially sent to Hangzhou yesterday to host the press and report the truth.

The borrowing of props for a play was the cause of the dispute

The general idea is that the students of Jinhua Middle School held a recreational meeting and came to borrow props, etc. More than a dozen students from the university went to visit, but were rejected at the door. The students of Yingshi University asked the students of Jinhua Middle School to ask the principal to come to the venue to solve the problem. But when Principal Hu arrived, he was aggressive and rude, saying that it was an obstacle to freedom. Later, with the persuasion of the guests, some students entered the venue, but booing broke out. The students of Yingshi University, feeling psychologically oppressed, left their seats and wanted to see Principal Hu. At this time, the dispute could have been resolved if Principal Hu had expressed a slight apology.

Principal Hu of Jinhua Middle School Refused to See the Mediator

More and more students from Yingshi University arrived. Cai, the Dean of Academic Affairs, and Zhang, the Director of Student Affairs, of the university rushed to mediate and represented Yingshi University to request a meeting with Principal Hu, but were still not granted an audience. The students of Jinhua Middle School tightly closed the outer door, and threw bricks, stones, and wooden sticks. Mr. Cai and Mr. Zhang were also insulted. The students suffered 17 serious injuries and more than 50 minor injuries. Later, County Chief Yang and others arrived at the scene and worked with Dean Cai to release the detained students. The next morning, police officers and soldiers from the military management area also arrived at the scene to maintain order. Regiment Commander Chen of the 102nd Regiment was willing to make a final mediation, but Principal Hu still refused to meet and did not get the point.

Soldiers Ignorantly Fired Guns - A Yingshi University Student Fell to the Ground

The soldiers fired blank guns, followed by live ammunition. One student from Yingshi University fell to the ground on the spot. Subsequently, there was a false rumor that a student had died, and the students went to Jinhua Middle School again to demand responsibility. Because the principal refused to meet, the order was disrupted, and the actions escalated, which is deeply regrettable, he said.

### British to Grant Special Treatment to Athletes from Various Countries Attending the World Games

[London Dispatch from the British Information Office] The British authorities will exempt athletes from various countries attending the Olympic World Games in July from customs duties on various necessities they bring with them. This measure will allow them to save on expenses, as they will not have to pay domestic production tax and purchase tax on sports equipment, clothing, food, and other goods. This preferential treatment will surely be welcomed by athletes from around the world, but it is limited to World Games athletes and other personnel actually attending the World Games. To ensure that this does not lead to abuse, a special uniform certificate will be issued. Its use is similar to a passport, and certificate holders can ride British trains at half price. A special booklet containing detailed instructions has been sent to more than fifty World Games committees. This is the result of lengthy discussions between various sports committees and government departments. Many countries have notified the committee of the special foods and wines required by their athletes. The committee will exercise special caution in the preparation and distribution of these items to ensure that they are not affected by the black market.

Literature

### From the Army

— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Qing'ai

This cemetery, filled with officers, was like a garden of blooming flowers. Military caps, rose-purple military trousers, gold epaulets, gold buttons, sabers, staff officers' tassels, light infantry and light cavalry's colored cloaks, all moved back and forth in the cemetery. The crosses on the graves, either white or black, spread their terrifying iron, stone, or wooden arms above the remains of the deceased.

They had just buried the wife of Colonel Limushen. She drowned two days ago while swimming.

The matter was over, and the priest left, but the colonel, supported by officers, stood in front of the grave, where he could still see the coffin containing the body of his young wife, which had already begun to decompose.

He was almost an old man, a tall, thin man with a completely white beard. Three years ago, he married the orphan of his fellow Colonel Soldi.

The two captains and lieutenants who were supporting him tried to lead him away. However, he resisted, holding back the tears that filled his eyes with a heroic posture, and later muttered in a low voice: "No, no, wait a little longer." He supported his weak legs and resolutely stayed there, on the edge of the grave, which seemed to him like a bottomless abyss into which his heart, his life, and everything he had left in the world would fall.

Suddenly, General Wolk came over. He grabbed the colonel's arm and almost dragged him away, saying: "What, what, old friend, you shouldn't be squatting here." So he obeyed and finally went home.

Just as he pushed open the door of his study, he saw a letter on his desk. He picked up the letter and almost fell because of surprise and emotion, because he recognized his wife's handwriting. The postmark on the letter was from that day. So he opened the envelope and began to read:

"Father, please allow me to call you father as before. When you receive this letter, I will surely be dead and buried. In this way, you may be able to forgive me.

"I do not want to think of any way to move you and mitigate my guilt. I will only use the sincere attitude of a woman who will commit suicide within an hour to speak clearly, completely, and without omission.

"When you married me out of kindness, I devoted myself to you out of gratitude, and I loved you with my girlish sincerity. My love for you at that time was almost like my love for my father in the past; later, one day, because I was sitting on your lap, and also because you kissed me, I couldn't help but call you 'Father'. It was a sudden, instinctive response from my conscience. Indeed, you were a father in my mind at that time, only a father. You smiled and said to me: 'Always call me that, my child, it makes me happy.'

"After we arrived in this city... Now please forgive me, father, I fell in love. Oh! I resisted for a long time, almost two years. Please listen carefully, almost two years, later I succumbed and became a sinner. I became a failed woman.

"As for 'him'. You will surely not guess who it is. I am very confident about this, because there were twelve officers in total, always around me, coming and going with me. You have long called them my twelve satellites.

"Father, please do not try to identify him, and please do not hate him. He did what anyone in his position would have done to me, and I really know that he also loved me sincerely.

"However, let me tell you: One day, our rendezvous was on Partridge Island; do you know it? That small island near the water mill. I was supposed to swim there and land, and he was supposed to wait for me in the woods, and then squat down until evening to avoid being seen coming out. As soon as I found him, I suddenly saw Philip, your orderly, from between the separated branches. He launched a surprise attack on us. I felt that we had all failed, and I cried out; then he, my friend, said to me: 'Swim away, slowly, my dear, let me and this guy stay here.'

"I left, so nervous that I almost drowned, and later returned to your house, waiting for terrible things.

"An hour later, Philip met me in the hallway of the living room. He said to me in a low voice: 'I am here to await Madan's instructions. If Madan has any letters to give me.' So I understood that he had betrayed himself, and it was my friend who bought him.

"In fact, I gave him many letters, all my letters. He sent them all, and also brought me replies.

"This went on for about two months. We all trusted him at that time, just as you trusted him at that time.

"Speaking of this, father, this is what happened to me. One day, I met your orderly again on that island where I used to swim, but this time, alone. This guy was waiting for me, and then notified me in advance that he would immediately report us to you and hand over many letters that he had stolen and kept, unless I expressed surrender to his desires.

"Blow, father, my father, I was afraid at that time, a despicable, cowardly fear, especially afraid of you, so kind and deceived by me, and also afraid for him, that you might kill him, and also afraid for myself, perhaps, now do I know? At that time, I was already confused and panicked, I believed in buying this evil again who loved me, what a shame!

"Our hopes are so weak, we women, so that we make more mistakes than you. Besides, when a person has already fallen, they are always falling to lower and lower places. Now do I know what I did before? Only understanding that one of you two and myself were about to die - I finally surrendered to this thug.

"You see now, father, you see now that I refuse to ask for an excuse for myself.

"Then, then, then, what I expected finally arrived - he took hold of me again and again whenever he wanted to use this to threaten me. He became my lover again, like another, every day. Isn't this embarrassing? And what a punishment, father!

"Then, I said to myself: 'I should die'. Living, I cannot confess such a great sin to you. Dead, I dare do anything. I can't do anything except die. There is nothing in the world that can wash me away. My stains are too severe. I cannot love, nor can I be loved; it is as if I contaminate anyone, just when I shake hands with them.

"In a while, I will go swimming and never come back.

"This letter to you must first be sent to my lover. He will surely receive it after I die, and without understanding anything, he will send it to you, thus completing my last freedom. Finally, you will read it after returning home from the cemetery.

"Farewell, father, I have nothing to say to you. Please do as you wish, and please forgive me."

The colonel wiped his forehead, which was covered with beads of sweat. His calmness, the calmness he had in battle, returned to him again.

He rang the bell.

A servant walked in.

"Call Philip to me," he said.

Then, he slightly opened a drawer in his desk.

The man came in almost immediately, a tall soldier with a big red beard, a cunning look, and glittering eyes.

The colonel stared straight at him.

"You tell me who my wife's lover is."

"Colonel, in the end..."

The officer held his pistol in the slightly open drawer.

"Speak, and hurry, you know I'm not joking."

"Then... Colonel... it's Captain Saint Albert."

Just as he said this name, a flash of fire burned his eyes, and he fell down, a bullet embedded in the center of his forehead.

Before she was eighty years old, if she didn't work for a day, she felt like she was confined. She said: "I'd rather be sick than idle."

National soldiers, Japanese rabbits, guerrillas, puppet troops, and real bandits, although she never left her house, she encountered them all. She often got up in the middle of the night and drove away bandits with desperate shouts.

Death should bow to her because she feared nothing. She prayed for death, she firmly believed that the underworld was definitely more peaceful than the world.

"Now I'm useless, eating idle rice." This was her mantra.

The ninety-three-year-old woman, eating a bowl of idle rice because she had lost her ability to work, expressed heartfelt shame to herself, to others, and to all things in the universe.

After paying her taxes, my mother devoted herself to worshipping Buddha. To avoid idle talk between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, she gave up her twenty-year habit of smoking opium.

In the summer, I tried to persuade her to get a vaccination, but she always refused with the words "Old woman learning fashion, it's a laughingstock." Her eyes were so blurred that she often ate dead flies in the soy sauce bowl along with her brown rice. When others worried about her, she said it didn't matter, the Bodhisattva would bless kind people.

When she heard that my monthly salary was one hundred and twenty yuan, she was happy to the point of suspicion. She thought it was unreasonable to take so much money while never seeing the sun during the day or the sky at night. She worried that something ominous would happen to me.

Her only shortcoming was that she could never distinguish between the Kuomintang, the Communists, traitors, bandits, the Security Corps, and the Self-Defense Forces. She often tormented me with these old questions, with an apologetic expression. She didn't want to ask these things, because these questions had forced her to stop chanting scriptures.

The lives of several uneducated relatives in my family have taught me more than any university professor. My personality and thoughts have been greatly influenced by them. Because of them, I understand thrift, understand compassion, and understand real life. They have caused me to have an undying hatred for some other people, so that I often have a kind of determination that is not understood by outsiders. Although I have not followed my determination, it has more or less stopped the corruption of my body and mind. I still believe that I can be saved at any time.

I originally wanted to write more about this topic, such as how my sister-in-law would pick up a strip of torn cloth as wide as a finger on the grass on her way home from washing clothes, and always take it back to make a button, in case of need. But when I think of how my family all lived in the upper-middle class of the country, I'm embarrassed to ramble on.

### Landscape

— Mi Jutian

### Family Anecdotes

— Zhang Mingchun

Twenty-five years ago, the Chinese composition topic for the elementary school entrance exam was "Family Anecdotes." I now want to redo it voluntarily.

My father was a self-sufficient farmer who held the plow. When the rice was fragrant, he was a devout worshiper at the village's Land God shrine and a well-known good person who rushed to pay taxes ahead of others. The former village elders and local officials expressed satisfaction with him, saying he "knew his place." Those who lent money at high interest rates called him a model because he possessed the virtue of paying back early and paying all the interest.

He was once elected as the village chief. However, because there was a surplus of sixteen yuan in public funds that he couldn't handle, he was so anxious that he couldn't sleep or eat, which made my sisters afraid to laugh and talk loudly.

He was an admirer of officialdom. Because the county government was urging the verification of land deeds, he was alarmed by the words "severe punishment without leniency for overdue documents" on the announcement. As a result, he became overly anxious, checking and rechecking the deeds. He even verified the same deed twice and was so upset that my mother, feeling sorry for him, didn't dare to lose her temper.

Local bullies played minor pranks on him. He told me about them as stories, never mentioning revenge. He adapted to his environment, balanced his life, and maintained his existence through extraordinary diligence and forbearance.

The pair of shoes he wore when he got married remained half-new until his peaceful death at the age of fifty-nine.

In terms of timidity, he was fortunate because he passed away before August 13th [likely referring to the start of the Battle of Shanghai in 1937].

I have a maternal grandmother who is truly ninety-three years old this year and has never left the countryside. Apart from her only daughter—my mother—she has no other relatives, so she often lives with us. My maternal grandfather died when my mother was four years old. When I see my grandmother, I feel like I'm seeing a living symbol of chastity.

Strangely enough, she often opposed my studying. The only reason was that she was afraid I would grow up to write indictments and file lawsuits. She looked down on scholars and saw through the officialdom.

She almost never used paper money.

"A load of manure being sold for five thousand yuan is outrageous! Outrageous!" Since the war of resistance, she often made such remarks, always shaking her head, which already shook automatically.

### Yellow Bird

— Lü Feng

You, over nine hundred fighting warriors, have come to this human battlefield with the warm breeze of the wheat ears.

Lucky little birds! Living in houses and traveling, wearing silver hooks and jade cups, inlaid with ivory and jadeite, with the inspiring and impassioned "Memorial to Departing Soldiers" engraved on them—that is to say, you also understand "dedicating yourselves to the utmost"!

The cage doors are opened, and the battle begins! You bite his leg, he pecks your neck. Attacking and killing each other, no longer caring about your beautiful feathers, leaping and tumbling endlessly.

Just as the charge rings out on the battlefield, and the sounds of fighting rise, until the opponent loses feathers and flees, the delicate yellow feathers scatter on the blood. Then people cheer, applaud, and praise!

You seem to understand that in this human marketplace, survival is battle, for yourselves and for the masters who raise you.

But I can't help but think of the fields and forests, when the morning sun first rises on the lake shore—the beautiful legend—your friend dies fighting a love rival.

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Shen

Wartime Literature in Germany

During the war, the German propaganda department has always heavily suppressed bookstores and libraries. Therefore, non-Nazi literature is rare not only in libraries of other countries but also in German libraries themselves. Whether burning books or banning books, books still continue to be published. Since books opposing the Nazis are not allowed to be published, Germany can only publish reprints of famous writers' works, what is called classical masterpieces. Most of these writers are from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The popularity of these books is not only for escapism but also to take this opportunity to carefully appreciate the greatness of Germany's past literature.

The complete works of Romantic writers published by Insel-Verlag and Leipzig bookstores include female writer Annette von Droste-Hulshoff (1797-1848) printed in one volume on India paper in 1939, and Joseph von Eichendorff (1788-1857) printed in two volumes in 1940, while Novalis's works were published in 1942. Novalis's complete works were originally compiled by R.H. Samuel, who is now a professor at the University of Melbourne. Adalbert Stifter's complete works are in seven volumes, including two volumes of essays, and the novels "Witiko," "Nachsommer," and "Studien" were published in 1939 and 1943. The Propyläen Verlag published a historical-critical edition of Friedrich Hölderlin's (1770-1843) complete works in four volumes, with a preface by Friedrich Seebass. S. Fischer published a seventeen-volume complete edition of Gerhart Hauptmann's works in 1942. Anthologies include works by female writer Clemens Brentano (1778-1842) and Jean Paul (1763-1825). The eight-volume complete works of humorous writer Wilhelm Busch were published in 1944; because they contained several letters to Jewish friends, they were banned. The same thing happened to Roedl's "Adalbert Stifter biography" because he was a descendant of Jews.

Many important letters have also been discovered. Brentano's "Correspondence with Sophie Mereau" (Briefwechsel mit Sophie Mereau) was published in 1939; Ecuard Morike's collection was also published in 1939, with a preface by Seebass.

The biggest successes are two series of books: the "Spiegel" series, which includes over seventy novels; the "Trosteinsamkeit" series, which includes over two hundred short stories; and the "Eternal Treasures of German Lyric Poetry" series, which includes thirty collections of poetry.

Sometimes the purpose of publishing books is simply to attack the Nazis, covered only by a thin veil. They often use photocopying methods, and the Nazis have no way to catch their mistakes. For example, the reprint of Stifter's "Lesebuch zur Forderung Humaner Bildung" (Reader for the Promotion of Humane Education), just the title itself, is contrary to Nazi ideology. S. Fischer Verlag reprinted Matthias Claudius's complete works in three volumes in 1941, still using the etchings and woodcut illustrations from 1775, which contained many attacks on militarism.

Translations of foreign literature cannot fully express the actual demands of the German people. There are quite a few translations of John Steinbeck's works. Others include Racine, Gorki, Pushkin, Swift, etc.

The following biographical and critical studies are worth mentioning: Wilhelm Grenzmann's "G. Chr. Lichtenberg," Otto Dencke's "Lichtenberg biography" In 1943, on the centenary of Hölderlin, a collection of commemorative essays was published. Two good books have also been published about Goethe.

The following are some works by modern German novelists, some of whom are well-known. All of these are worth the attention of those who study modern German literature:

Werner Bergengruen's "Was sich der Feldherr denkt, wenn er nicht siegt" (What the General Thinks When He Does Not Conquer), a historical novel about pain and hysteria. Verika Mitterer's "Der ferne Fürst" (The Distant Prince), a medieval story. Arnold Ulitz's "Die Magd von London" (The Maid of London) is a Defoe-style novel. Konrad Haemmerling and Erna Grauthoff both wrote novels on Shakespearean themes. Arthur Luther's "Der Teufel" (The Devil) is about the Russian poet Lermontov. Ernst Wiechert's "Das einfache Leben" (The Simple Life) is also a good book.

### Tear Down the "Stone God Temple"!

— Tong Tuo

I have always thought that ignorant men and women are most common in rural areas. For example, when the time is right, they want to have some entertainment, but they also borrow the name of the gods. Like welcoming gods and temple fairs, and outdoor operas, they are all held in the name of thanking the gods. Little do they know that people living in cities, despite the progress of science and the material enjoyment being countless times better than the simple life in the countryside, there are still more superstitious people who take flattering gods and worshiping Buddha as their only duty, and praying for good fortune as their only entertainment. It is truly felt that the old slogans shouted out twenty years ago, "Mr. Democracy" in politics and "Mr. Science" in society and culture, still need to be loudly appealed and reminded.

Sadly, the degree of ignorance of superstitious people in cities is even worse than in the countryside. A patient in the countryside seeks fairy prescriptions, invites Taoist priests to eliminate disasters and draw hexagrams, and prays for blessings. Under natural physiological conditioning, the patient's condition gradually turns for the better, leading to a sudden recovery. Thus, they attribute it to the care of the gods, and there is their consistent superstitious way. Urban patients are not like this. On the one hand, they are using modern injections, electrical treatments, blood tests, and stool tests—all conclusions obtained from physiology, anatomy, and pharmacology—to treat diseases along a purely scientific path. But on the other hand, they still do not abandon ignorant practices: buying lottery tickets and asking the gods, gambling on flower associations and asking the gods, prostitutes praying for the prosperity of their trade and asking the gods, wives wishing for a male birth and asking the gods... Moreover, because there is a great shortage of gods and Buddhas in cities, a pair of stone statues beside the racecourse is regarded as solemnly decorated gods and Buddhas, and day and night, people kneel down and kowtow to them on the roadside.

Recently, ignorant men and women have become even more devout to the two stone statues beside the racecourse. They put up a plaque and call it the Stone God Temple, apply real gold, hang red silk, decorate it with candle stands, and arrange incense burners, creating a magnificent view of a "roadside temple." If this is beneficial to society, there is only one point, which is to prevent the nearby street urchins from wandering around day and night. They have unknowingly acquired a new profession: similar to the temple monks in temples and monasteries. They light incense and candles for those who seek gods, and when the former leaves and the latter comes, they disregard the sincerity of those who seek gods and the incense offerings to the stone statues, and honestly and unceremoniously pull them out and sell them wholesale. Of course, there are also ignorant men and women who give a little money to reward them for their "service" in lighting incense and candles (they also provide cushions for kneeling).

The day before yesterday, the newspaper reported that Director Yu Shuping ordered the prohibition of ignorant men and women from burning incense in front of that "Stone God Temple," and sent two policemen to monitor, the reason being that it obstructed traffic. I was originally wondering: the Shanghai Municipal Government's enlightened administration has built a good reputation, but why has it not seen this and simply abolished the "Stone God Temple" in one fell swoop? Even if today's cities still have some stains, we can at least first scrub away one of the stains. Now, indeed, the police station is coming out to intervene, although their reason is only the weak "obstruction of traffic," but in fact, they can say that it is to eliminate superstition. If the authorities have the next determination, I believe that it is not enough to just send a few policemen to prohibit it and consider that their task has been completed, because this is passive; the fundamental method is to smash the plaque, remove the decorations, and then smear the stone statues with cement, which is the thorough way. If the authorities are willing to transfer their spirit of banning dancing to banning superstition, and use the means of banning opium to ban flattering gods and worshiping Buddha, wouldn't that be a happy thing! This newspaper's reprint of the casual words of idlers at the end of the report on this news on the 30th, the so-called "Let's see if Yu Shuping can be a successful director," such an Ah Q-style insult can be laughed off.

I respect religion as much as science, but I feel that religion and superstition are two completely different things. If we do not fight against superstition, the pure religion will never be able to express itself. Superstition needs to be overthrown and eliminated like opium. Today's increasingly serious "Stone God Temple" is only one aspect of it.

### Substance and Function

— Sun He

I think that political reforms can be explained by borrowing two words from the Song Confucian scholars on moral philosophy: one is "substance" and the other is "function." The former is policy, doctrine, and principle. The latter belongs to technology, method, and style.

In the "substance" aspect, it must be established and can be practiced; "function" is just a minor issue.

The Three Principles of the People are incompatible with bureaucracy. If the Three Principles of the People are implemented, bureaucracy will fall without being attacked. As long as there is the determination and courage to implement them, even if the method is not brilliant, the technology is not high, and the style is immature, it is only a matter of time, and it will inevitably be quickly corrected, so as not to repeat the mistakes.

Driving skills are a small problem; the main thing is to see if the direction is accurate. If the direction is right, that is, if the steering wheel is held steady, even if the driving is not perfect, as long as you don't drive backward, you will slowly move towards a prosperous road and towards your destination. If the direction is inaccurate, even if the technology is high and you can drive fast, you will still inevitably repeat the mistakes. This is a plain truth.

I think it is unnecessary to quibble about the technical efficiency of administration; it is like nitpicking. Of course, we cannot avoid treatment for fear of illness, but picking small faults is not necessarily beneficial to the patient. We need to find the source of the disease, find the crux of the matter, rather than just looking at the superficial symptoms, and comparing the size of firewood is ultimately more important than examining the tip of a hair. Treating the symptoms is like retreating from a cold fever and stopping a headache; it is better to treat the root cause by killing bacteria and cleansing the internal organs. I offer this to the new cabinet.

### Seemingly Correct, But Actually Wrong

— You Mojun

Zhuangzi's "achieving with the hand what the heart desires" (得手應心) has now become "achieving with the hand what the heart commands" (得心應手); and the same book's "each time down, the worse it gets" (每下愈况) has long since become "each time, the worse it gets" (每况愈下). The previous edition of this journal has already corrected this mistake. There are many such seemingly correct but actually wrong phrases, and they are not limited to the interchange of two characters. Now, let's talk about the three sentences "not just one instance" (不一而足), "how easy to talk about" (談何容易), and "flying yellow, rising fast" (飛黃騰踏);

"Not just one instance" (不一而足) comes from the Gongyang Commentary's twenty-ninth year of Duke Xiang, meaning not to be satisfied with the beauty of one thing. Now it is commonly used to mean that something is not just once, and it has become accustomed to being used, and people no longer feel that it is wrong. This is because of entanglement errors that have become seemingly correct but actually wrong.

"How easy to talk about" (談何容易) is found in the Book of Han, Biography of Dongfang Shuo. "The King of Wu said, 'Sir, you can talk.' The gentleman said, 'How easy to talk about!'" "How easy" is like saying "how can it be?" Also, the Biography of He Jin in the Later Han Dynasty says: "The affairs of the country, how easy can it be?" According to this, "easy" is not read connected to "how," so "how easy" is like saying "how can it be so easy?" This is because of segmentation into words that has become seemingly correct but actually wrong, and it has become accustomed to being used, and it has become a case of accumulated errors becoming the norm.

The "rise fast" (達) in "flying yellow, rising fast" (飛黃騰達) should be "step" (踏). Flying yellow is the name of a horse, as in Han Changli's poem: "Flying yellow stepping quickly, cannot look after the toad." Yellow represents the color of the horse, and flying describes the speed of the horse, so even though it is "stepping" (踏), it cannot look after the toad. Now, changing "step" to "rise" (達), it is thought that this is because of misunderstanding "yellow" as the "yellow list" (黃榜) issued by the emperor in the past. This is because of misunderstanding that it has become seemingly correct but actually wrong.

### Conversations on the Qin (Zither)

— Banmeng Laoren (Old Man Half Dream)

In the past, when I was in Beiping, there was a classmate named Zhang, who was skilled in playing the qin (zither). Every night when the wind was clear and the moon was bright, he would bring his qin and come over to play a few tunes for me. Although I didn't know the qin and couldn't be like Bo Ya to Zhong Ziqi, and join the ranks of connoisseurs, listening to it also felt very enjoyable. My restlessness would disappear, and I felt that it was different from other instruments, and it truly had a captivating feeling.

Zhang had five qins in his room, the shortest and oldest of which was purchased after someone dug it up from the soil when he was an official in Baimen. The cracks were mottled, and it was over five hundred years old. When played, the sound was like a bell in an empty mountain or the sound of flowing springs, which was better than the other four qins. Zhang said that whenever a qin came into his hands, he could tell its quality at a glance, without having to play or tune it, in order to distinguish its age. I deeply believed it. Zhang asked me to write an inscription to carve on this qin, but I am uncultured and an amateur, so I barely managed to put together a saying for him at the time, which inevitably failed to live up to the beauty of the qin, like putting dung on a Buddha's head, and made me a laughingstock.

Zhang also said: The best qin wood is tong wood for the face and catalpa wood for the bottom; pure tong wood is second best; tong wood for the face and fir wood for the bottom is the next best. The qin takes tong wood as yang wood and catalpa wood as yin wood. When yin and yang are matched, the sound is harmonious. If pure tong wood is used, the yang side of the tong must be used for the face and the yin side for the bottom, in order to achieve yin and yang harmony. How to choose the wood is to select the tong wood that faces the sun, cut it off, and sink it in water. Its yang side faces up, and its yin side faces down. After soaking in water for a long time, take the upward-facing side to make the qin face and the downward-facing side to make the qin bottom. After the qin is made, the material of the qin face is turbid in the morning and clear in the evening, turbid when sunny and clear when rainy, while the material of the qin bottom is clear in the morning and turbid in the evening, clear when sunny and turbid when rainy. Good players can understand this intuitively, down to the slightest detail, which cannot be understood by crude and impetuous people. Zhang repeatedly wanted to teach me fingering, but I was unwilling to endure the hardship of plucking and picking, so I politely declined. This matter has been more than twenty years ago.

The poem says: "Planting paulownia and catalpa, collecting lacquer, thus felling for qin and se" (椅桐村漆，爰伐琴瑟). Using tong and catalpa wood for qin has been a long tradition. Later generations also used copper and stone, as well as ebony and other woods, to make qins. There are also those that are made of various short materials, glued and lacquered together, called patchwork qins. There are also those that are inlaid with tortoise shell patterns, brocade pieces, mixed with ivory, incense, and bone, covering the entire qin body, and called real qins. These mostly belong to decorations and are not the true purpose of the qin. The Palace Museum has a Song Dynasty kiln qin, called the porcelain qin, supported by rosewood, with the middle process of the image system, the length and shortness are appropriate, the fetal bone is fully exposed, its quality is purple sand, the thirteen emblem, filled with white twist, the foot are made of jade. There is an inscription in the dragon pool that says: "Maintaining the sand and tile, the system from Hongmeng, kites fly and fish leap, sing the south wind." In the Phoenix Marsh are the four characters "cultivate oneself rationally," the characters are made of Qin seal, the color is moonlight white, extremely crystal clear to the utmost. When tapped with a finger, the sound is like a tile jar. It is heard that Zheng Yingsun of Huizhou is good at playing the qin. When he strings it and plays it, he cannot make a sound. Does it also belong to the category of decorations?

There are inscriptions from eight families on the lacquered box of the porcelain qin, the first of which is by Emperor Qianlong. Ji Huang said: "Potters secretly made, coordinated with the sound of silk, not just like its shape, the divine truth exists. The elegant instrument of the Song Dynasty, which can be compared with the Xiaoliang? Thank them for cutting with axes, naturally without traces. Thinking of the beginning of the fight, the harmony is confused, like jade, warm in spring." Qian Chenqun said: "Official or settled is the correct color, the seven strings are already harmonious and flat, a drum is like spring for four seats, and a second drum makes us happy people, quietly seeing Shun on the banks of the He." Dong Bangda said: "Not cinnabar, not lacquer, not stone, not gold, the earth type is made of virtue, quiet and deep, Taohe on the shore of the South Dongqin, Yiyang has branches empty Yin Sen, after the fire tail is not焦, dense 理纹无侵, 慎 will Wanpu care the ancient heart, mountain mountain 欹崟, A stroke of a chord to announce the 元音". The rest are not fully recorded. Tao Yuanliang in the past had a stringless qin, saying: "But to get the fun of the qin, why bother with the sound of the strings." The greatest sound must be the rarest, the greatest taste must be the lightest, such as the porcelain qin, its meaning is probably here?

### The Unlucky Ninth Symphony

— Guo Ping

The great German musician Beethoven (1770-1827) passed away after completing his ninth symphony. The modern German musician Bruckner (1824-1896) wrote his ninth symphony, but died without completing the final movement. Similarly, another German musician, Mahler (1860-1911), also died after completing his ninth symphony. All three of them were born in Vienna.

Regarding Mahler, there is the following true story. Mahler was extremely superstitious. After seeing the fate of Beethoven and Bruckner, he temporarily paused his work after completing his eighth symphony. He began to write songs, wanting to compete with fate, meaning that he did not want to have the name of "dying with the ninth symphony." Soon, he retired to a village in the Alps. Because he felt that the surrounding scenery was too beautiful, he couldn't help but devote his emotions to the ninth symphony. He began to compose, forgetting the lessons of the past.

One day, when Mahler was writing the last and greatest movement, an eagle suddenly flew in from the window, circling and flapping its wings in the room, causing plaster to fly everywhere and music sheets to scatter. Mahler quickly sat down in an armchair. After the eagle flew out, a crow flew out from under the armchair. Mahler considered it an ominous sign (Germans consider crows to be unlucky birds) and was dazed for a long time. He knew that death was coming, but he felt at peace in his heart. He poured his strong emotions and great melodies into his final chapter. He completed his ninth symphony, but before he could begin writing his tenth symphony, he died of illness in the village. Fortunately, his ninth symphony is famous all over the world, and many orchestras are playing his immortal piece. If anyone has seen the movie "Gone with the Wind" and understands music, then he must have heard some of the movements from this symphony.

### The Death of Liu Jin

— Xing Jian

In the feudal era, where the emperor reigned supreme, the treatment of those who plotted rebellion was extremely cruel. In addition to exterminating the nine clans, the main culprits themselves were made to suffer as much as possible, dying slowly. Even more cruel was the practice of executing someone by slow slicing, then chopping off the skin, stuffing it with straw, grinding the bones to dust, and scattering the ashes, using it like a specimen to show the public.

Regarding the number of slices in slow slicing, opinions vary, and there is no consensus. Some say eighty-one slices, some say one hundred and eight slices, but according to what is recorded in books, the most tragic was as many as three thousand three hundred and fifty-seven slices, which took two days to die.

Zhang Wenlin's chronicle of Duke Duanyan of the Ming Dynasty records that when he was the principal of the Ministry of Justice, he personally witnessed the execution of Liu Jin:

"...Later, according to the imperial decree, Liu Jin was executed by slow slicing for three days, his body was chopped up and his head hung up to show the world. The number of slices for slow slicing was typically three thousand three hundred and fifty-seven, with a rest and a shout every ten slices. On the first day, it was customary to first slice three hundred and fifty-seven slices, like the nail of the big toe, starting from the left and right of the chest. When the knife first moved, there was blood flowing about an inch. Then, when the knife moved again, there was no blood. People said that the prisoner was frightened, and the blood all entered the lower abdomen and calves. When the abdomen was opened after the slicing, the blood all came out from here. In the evening, Liu Jin was escorted to the Wanping County Prison of Shuntian Prefecture. After being released from his bonds for a few moments, Jin was still able to eat two bowls of porridge. The next day, he was escorted to Dongjiaotou. The previous day, when Jin was executed, he spoke a lot about internal affairs, and his mouth was stuffed with hemp seeds. After dozens of slices, he died. At that time, the sun was rising. He and the supervising official, Shi Ben, jointly reported to the emperor, who gave the holy decree: Liu Jin has been executed by slow slicing, his body should be chopped, and the hanging of his head should be omitted. A large axe was used to chop the body across the chest, and the chest was blown away for several feet."

From this, it can be seen that the cruelty of slow slicing had reached its extreme. Compared with today's chemical castration, it can be said to be a comparison between a great sorcerer and a petty sorcerer.

Mr. Ban Shaoweng mentioned in a letter that he once traveled to West Lake with his brother Yu Jingzhai, intending to find "Yu Lou" as a place to reside. It is an interesting and wonderful story because Jingzhai shares the same surname as Qu Yuan Sou. However, they couldn't find its location, and some said it had already become a tavern, causing them to feel lost and disappointed. But things have no fixed owner, and heaven and earth are merely temporary lodgings. Before his passing, Mr. Qu Yuan had already expressed this sentiment in his poem Bid Farewell to Yu Lou. The poem reads: "Occupying a corner of the lake building, I lean on the railing here every year. The person in the building is gone, but the building remains, let Zhang, Wang, Li, and Zhao look at it as they please." This is one of the "Twelve Farewells." His farewell to Qu Yuan says: "This small garden is also quite nice, with potted ponds and fist-sized rocks arranged naturally. The spring breeze doesn't know that the Lord of the East has departed, and it still arrives on time every year." Bidding farewell to this world: "Since I have entrusted my form to this world, there is endless chaos and trouble. Once I transcend the three thousand realms, I will not care about the water, fire, and wind of the human world." And the most extraordinary of all is "Bidding Farewell to Yu Yue," saying: "I have spent eighty years of my life and energy on this one name and surname. Today, I take my true self away alone, letting it be worn away or passed down." The most likely to arouse empathy in scholars, one is "Bidding Farewell to My Writings:" "In my old age, I have made contributions to the literary world, writing poetry and prose in my spare time from studying the classics. I leave them all to the human world, and I will not hear of praise or criticism." One is "Bidding Farewell to the Four Treasures of the Study:" "My closest friends are the stationery, which helped me achieve fame in the world of writing. Alas, the heroes are gone, and the moss abandons the salary and sinks the spear." The so-called four treasures are paper, ink, brush, and inkstone. Paper and brushes are consumed the fastest, and ink is also easily used up, but only the inkstone can last a long time and be passed down through generations, so scholars often name their studio after an inkstone. As for the stationery of modern scholars, it is different from the old days. For example, our colleagues in the newspaper industry have the saying "Three treasures of newspaper reporters: ink, paste, and small scissors." Although it is somewhat humorous, it is also true. Even an old man like me, who only writes manuscripts and does not hold an editorial position, needs these three things at hand, let alone all the chief editors!

### Gray Hair

— Shi Shufan

Gray hair changes and life is unpitying, the lonely lamp swells and recedes, each time seeming like the tide. The world's affairs become inkstones and bones become ..., How can the lung fire and heart soldiers not be extinguished?

Closing the door, I foolishly pray for the wild man's heart, outside the door, the red mulberry water is even deeper. Old stories, new ..., iron arguments, the border city collects tears to cast gold.

White ... sparsely ..., the grass grows long, swords and crowns from ten provinces grow of their own accord. Measuring clothes, people gradually say the waistline is large, can it make up for the war and famine?

The death of grass and the demise of trees are all related, a masterless decaying willow bends on the road. I lament that the life force before spring is exhausted, how can I expect a chance for rebirth to be asked by everyone!

The stars are distinctly clear, indicating direction, who is hiding in the cup, comparable to old Peng? The shadow of the sweaty whip before my eyes, drunk at dusk, weeping in the cowshed.

Waving my hand like the tail of a winnowing basket, I cannot form sentences, the rooster crows all night under the azure clouds. Reading history, I often sigh for the departure of Chen Liang, ... to ... to look with compassion at Ling Jun.

Dreams ..., carriage wheels, the moon turns in my lapel, I vainly pity the vast and expansive ... poetic heart. A stream without water, without sound or color, is not worth half an inch of the oil lamp's depth.

Heaven entrusts me to write of the suffering of this place, the slanting sun and returning crows, the ink waves surging. Even if I look from a high place in the desolate city, what can I say about the roaming guests of the southeast!
