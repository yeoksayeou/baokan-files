[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 12th] The National Army in Northern Jiangsu achieved a glorious victory in recovering Shuyang, killing and wounding a total of 4,270 bandits from the 2nd and 12th Columns, capturing over 200, and seizing 11 light machine guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 82 grenade launchers, 2 mortars, and 105 rifles. The Air Force also bombed and sank over 100 bandit boats. After this blow, most of the seriously wounded bandits were executed, with only the lightly wounded soldiers being transported back, a truly miserable situation.

[Military News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] After the National Army recovered Shuyang, in order to thoroughly annihilate the bandit forces in Northern Jiangsu, they launched a full-scale campaign. The encirclement and suppression troops advancing north from Shuyang have already exceeded Sangdongbei by 12 kilometers and are advancing towards Fangshan Street. Another elite force is advancing from A-Hu Chengtou towards Fangshan Street. The National Army advancing from Huaiyin in two directions has already approached the suburbs of Lianshui. Another force is conducting search and suppression operations near Shuyang. Each elite force is intensifying its mopping-up operations, and the bandit suppression troops advancing south from Shuyang are coordinating with the troops advancing north from Huaiyin to jointly attack the bandits fleeing south.

[Military News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] The National Army in Sixian, Northern Anhui, pursuing east, has recovered Qingyang Town and is continuing to pursue northeast.

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 12th] The National Army in Western Henan continues its eastward sweep from Lushi and has now recovered Fanli. The bandit troops under Li Jingyi have collapsed and fled east. A small group of about 200 bandits who attacked Shaanxi Prefecture have infiltrated into Caiyuan, southeast of Shaanxi Prefecture, and local defense forces are intercepting them. It is reported that the bandits recently held a military conference in Guanyintang, planning to use four brigades to attack Western Henan again, eliminate the local defense forces, and invade Tongguan, coordinating with the bandits moving south from Hancheng and Heyang to threaten Guanzhong. It is reported that the bandits along the Jing River in western Guanzhong have not given up their ambition and have recently attempted to establish several underground transportation lines, namely controlling the narrow mountain paths and infiltrating the National Army's defense areas. Local garrison troops have already uncovered many cases and are maintaining strict vigilance to prevent bandit infiltration. Also, the Communist bandits' First Column in Shaanxi has moved from the Huanglong Mountain area to the Chengcheng area and engaged in fierce fighting with the local defense forces. A force of about 400 has been surrounded near Wangzhuang and is currently being annihilated.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 12th] The bandit den near Bailu Lake in the Jianghan District has been completely destroyed by the National Army, and many important bandit warehouses have been seized. The amount of cloth for military uniforms, even those not yet made, reached over 20,000 sets.

### Notorious Bandit Duan Ying Captured After Sneaking into Kunming; Apprehended in a Nunnery with His Mistress

[Our Correspondent in Kunming, 12th] Duan Ying, a notorious bandit in Western Yunnan, known as "Little Fire Dragon," gathered bandits to organize the Democratic Allied Army, claiming to be the "Commander of the Western Yunnan Column." Recently, it was learned that Duan Ying had sneaked into Kunming. After careful deployment by the police and security department, Duan Ying and his mistress, Tian Julan, were finally captured at the Mingni Nunnery in the western suburbs. Duan has confessed without reservation, claiming to have joined the Communist Party in 1928 and the Democratic League in 1947. He currently has over 2,000 bandits under his command, with over 600 rifles and 3 local cannons. This time, he disguised himself and sneaked into Kunming, intending to contact accomplices in Kunming and secretly plot an uprising. Unexpectedly, he was arrested. The interrogation is still ongoing, aiming to reveal the remaining accomplices and sweep away the bandit atmosphere in Western Yunnan in one fell swoop.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 10th] The City Police Bureau recently announced the details of Duan Ying's capture, stating that after Police Chief Wang of the City Police Bureau received a report at the beginning of the month that bandit Duan had sneaked into Kunming, he immediately made careful deployments for reconnaissance. Li Zhizheng, the chief of the 2nd Branch of the Bureau, obtained reliable information confirming that bandit Duan was indeed in Kunming. Thus, on the morning of the 4th, Duan Ying and his mistress Tian Julan, a female student from Yao'an High School, were captured in the Mingjia Di Nunnery in the city. When the police officers took action, Duan and Tian were still sound asleep. After being arrested, Duan only confessed that this time he came to Kunming, disguised as a pig butcher on a small path, changed his name to Li Ming, so he was not noticed. The purpose was to contact accomplices and plan a comeback. He joined the Communist Party as early as 1928, when he was serving in the army and was introduced by Du Tao. In June 1947, he joined the Democratic League and was always under the command of Li Yiping. In February of this year, after several secret discussions, he left Kunming for Zhenkang in March, intending to launch an uprising there. Due to insufficient environmental conditions and people's aversion to chaos, he went to Dachan. After extensive contact, he gathered over 2,000 cadres, over 200 rifles, 3 local cannons, and new weapons, and operated in various parts of Western Yunnan, such as Dayao, Yao'an, Yanfeng, Huaping, and Yongren, gradually gaining momentum. At its peak, there were 3,000 people. The bandit side provided very little supplies, all relying on robbery and apportionment to maintain their livelihood, which was extremely painful. The internal gradually dispersed. Later, after military suppression and strict searches by township security teams, they could not gain a foothold in the Dayao area and had to risk coming to Kunming to seek another development. Bandit Duan also admitted that the Communist bandits had used sweet words to incite him, saying that after his uprising, they would give him full support. Unexpectedly, after the launch, he never received any help, resulting in this tragic failure. He deeply hoped that those who were deceived into participating in the activities of the traitorous bandits could realize their past mistakes as soon as possible and return to the right path to avoid the suffering of the people and deepen the condemnation of their conscience.

They then went to the International Friendship Association to rest and held a press conference at 9:30 AM. At 11:00 AM, accompanied by Director Shen, they went to the Arctic Pavilion official residence to pay respects to President Chiang and thank him for our initial recognition of the Korean government. At 12:30 PM, the President hosted a banquet, and Li Zongren, Wu Dingchang, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Liu Shishun, and Shen Changhuan were invited to accompany him. The President expressed great concern for the situation after Korean independence and emphasized the traditional friendship between the two countries, which will continue to grow in the future. At 4:00 PM, Zhao drove to the Mausoleum to visit Sun Ke, Chairman of the Sino-Korean Cultural Association. He then attended a joint welcome tea party held by the National Diplomacy Association, the Sino-Korean Cultural Association, and the Catholic Cultural Association. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Weng Wenhao. Zhao is scheduled to visit the Mausoleum on the morning of the 13th and visit various universities in Nanjing. At noon, he will attend a banquet hosted by Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the National Diplomacy Association. In the afternoon, he will visit Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan. In the evening, he will attend a dinner at the official residence of Foreign Minister Wang Shijie.

### Zhao Bingyu's Remarks

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Dr. Zhao Bingyu spoke freely about the relationship between China and Korea at the press conference and answered questions about the current situation in Korea. He first explained that the purpose of his trip was to represent President Syngman Rhee in paying respects to President Chiang and thanking the Chinese government and people for their assistance and sympathy to Korea's struggle for independence over the past forty years. China has protected Korean residents in China, allowing them to live safely and engage in national restoration work. President Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference and the Chinese representative in the United Nations delegation to Korea have provided decisive support and sympathy for Korea's independence. He said: The primary task of Korea after the establishment of an independent government is to revitalize the national economy, stabilize society, and unify the North and South to save the people of North Korea from the Soviet Union. The Korean government will overcome all difficulties to achieve this goal and hopes to continue to receive the sympathy of the Chinese government and people. At this point, he pointed out that there are still a few people in China who do not fully understand the establishment of the South Korean government, and a major newspaper has even published articles criticizing it. In fact, Korea should have its own autonomous government established for its freedom, independence, stability, and revitalization. However, the Soviet Union refuses to abandon its policy of using Korea as its balance of power base, so the United Nations Commission on Korea cannot complete the unification of North and South Korea. The openness and freedom of the South Korean elections were witnessed by the staff of the United Nations delegation to Korea. The South Korean government is by no means a so-called puppet government. He once came to China in 1926. This time, he feels like he has returned home. When he was studying as a child, he admired Confucius and Mencius. After coming to China, the famous cities and historical sites are even more unforgettable. He strongly believes that China and Korea have the same cultural traditions and the same problems. The goals of the two countries' struggles are also consistent. He hopes that they will work together in the future for the prosperity of Asia and the peace and democracy of the world. Then, in answering reporters' questions, he frankly admitted that if the U.S. and Soviet troops withdrew from Korea, a civil war might be inevitable. Although the South Korean government will devote itself to domestic unification, it has no intention of using force. However, the Chinese and Korean Communists have long colluded, and the inability to achieve reconciliation on internal Korean issues is just like what China is encountering. If the Soviet Union continues its attempt to conquer the world, the future is difficult to be optimistic about. South Korea currently has well-trained armed police of tens of thousands. The armed forces of the North Korean Communists are stronger because they have been cultivated by the Soviet Union. Regarding the U.S. military presence, he said: The U.S. has no territorial ambitions, and the military presence will not harm sovereignty. Korea and the U.S. have reached a temporary agreement on the military presence, and this agreement will be submitted to the Third Session of the UN General Assembly to be held in Paris. As for Japan-Korea relations, due to more than forty years of hostility, Koreans still inevitably feel disgusted today, but after the peace treaty is signed, the Korean government will still engage in repairing relations between the two countries. Koreans are also wary of the U.S. supporting Japan and hope that MacArthur will not be too lenient with Japan and allow it to rebuild its military. Finally, Zhao also sincerely wished for China to achieve peace.

It is reported that the main purpose of this trip is to understand the economic trends in the Southwest after the currency reform to provide reference for the central authorities and to solve some problems on the spot. Regarding whether the President will grant the special power of decisive disposal, Chen said that it still needs to be requested. In general, controlling daily necessities and stabilizing their prices is a prerequisite for stabilizing commodity prices in various places. He then said: The southwest economy is bound to improve along with the stable commodity prices in Nanjing and Shanghai.

Regarding Yang Xiaobo, manager of the Chongqing Central Bank, delaying the announcement of the use of the Gold Yuan, Zhu refused to criticize Yang personally, but said that it is being investigated.

### Guangzhou Launches Strict Anti-Smuggling and Blocking Network; Flow of Hot Money to the South Blocked; Bank Requests for Relaxation of Remittance Restrictions Denied

[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 12th] In order to prevent the large amount of hot money flowing from Shanghai to Guangzhou and then to Hong Kong recently, the Guangzhou Economic Supervision Office is paying full attention to anti-smuggling and blocking work. Bao'an is the first blocking line, Zhongshan is the second blocking line, and the Pearl River Delta is the sea blocking line, strengthening the anti-smuggling forces to prevent the flow of hot money.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] The flow of hot money from Shanghai used to be extremely turbulent for a while. These speculators used the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangzhou triangle to gain huge profits. In order to curb this frenzy that harms the country, the authorities have launched a close inspection network in recent days. And because of the restriction of the amount of remittances from banks, the tide of hot money flowing south has been blocked.

[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 12th] The implementation of the control of bank remittances here has had a great impact on the business of various banks. The daily remittance limit for each bank in the city is 100,000 yuan, and the average share of each of the 29 banks is only 3,400 yuan. Each remittance order must not exceed 500 yuan, which is a huge difference compared to the tens of thousands of yuan per order before the restriction. The City Banking Association recently sent a special representative to the supervisor to request that the remittance restriction be slightly relaxed. Huo Bao-shu replied that due to legal restrictions, it was not convenient to allow it and hoped that the banking community would take the overall situation into consideration and endure it temporarily. Also, the Economic Supervision Office recently ordered the Guangzhou Municipal Government to review the price limits for the public service, hotel, and film industries in Guangzhou because they were too high.

### The Authorities Pay Close Attention to the Results of Economic Reform; The Original Resolution of No Change in Principles but Continuous Improvement of Techniques; Investigation of Production Equipment in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] It was rumored that the authorities, to cooperate with economic reform, were working on a comprehensive political reform. According to sources, this is now a thing of the past. The authorities are currently focused on the results of economic reform. Although the party affairs reform plan is being finalized, the original political reform proposal has been temporarily suspended.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu paid a visit to Premier Weng on the morning of the 12th, talking for dozens of minutes. It was rumored that there was a meeting at Premier Weng's private residence on the morning of the 12th, but according to investigations, this was not true.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Zhang Lisheng, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan, told reporters with a firm attitude: "Please remember these two sentences: 'The government is determined to use political power to support the success of economic reform,' and 'The economic reform plan will not be revised in principle.'" Zhang went on to explain that while it is generally believed by scholars that economic problems must be solved by economic means, which has its own merits, in the current situation of our country, the thorough implementation of economic reform must be supported by political power to succeed. Although this is very unfavorable to a minority of people, we cannot sacrifice the economic lives of the majority of the people by appeasing a minority. As for the economic reform plan, the implementation techniques should be improved at any time, but in principle, there will be no change whatsoever. Zhang continued: "In order to achieve the goal of increased production, an investigation will be conducted on the existing production organization's equipment and its production capacity in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei, so as to provide effective assistance to their required funds, raw materials, and marketing issues. The government is particularly concerned with the appropriate coordination of three tasks: the outlet for idle funds, the source of materials, and price control. "Zhang then made a clear distinction between legitimate merchants and unscrupulous merchants. All those who have storefronts, register with the government, join trade associations, and bear various government taxes are legitimate merchants, and the government is determined to protect them, and the goods they display cannot be regarded as hoarding. On the contrary, those who have no storefront, or even no fixed address, have not registered, and do not bear national taxes, and hoard materials with large amounts of funds to speculate for profit are unscrupulous merchants, and everyone is entitled to report them. When asked by reporters about the large-scale hoarding cases uncovered in recent days, and how they would be handled if their status was special, Zhang replied: "Before the law, no matter what status or identity, there are no exceptions. If I (Zhang Lisheng referring to himself) have hoarding and speculation behavior, others can report me, and I will be severely punished according to the law."

Editorial

### The Common People's Shanghai!

Yesterday, Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Control Supervisor of the Shanghai District, delivered a passionate speech to thousands of people at the Youth Army Friendship Association. He loudly pointed out: Shanghai needs to change, and it is changing, and he believes that it can definitely become passable. He said that Shanghai is not a calm Shanghai, but it will have to go through a considerable period of storms, but the common people must be able to withstand the storms and welcome this change. He is determined to be a "servant" for the common people, to eradicate social vermin, and to turn this "paradise of adventurers" into the Shanghai of the common people.

From the enthusiastic emotions of thousands of people applauding and cheering for an hour, we can see the sincerity of the common people. The common people almost regarded Supervisor Chiang, who had the courage to lead the economic revolution movement, as a character in a legendary novel. However, we must recognize that the completion of this economic revolution cannot rely solely on a legendary hero, but must depend on the cooperation of the broad masses of the people.

Indeed, China should have a major transformation now, not just Shanghai. We hope that Shanghai can truly become the Shanghai of the common people; we hope even more that the entire China can become the China of the common people. The Republic of China should have been the China of the common people, but why is it that we only heard the call for "the Shanghai of the common people" yesterday? The reason can be worth our deep thought.

Shanghai, in the writing of an Italian writer, has been written as a "paradise of adventurers." Shanghai has always seemed to be filled with a miasma, a complete darkness. In fact, if Shanghai had nothing to recommend it, then Shanghai would not be worth such attention. The reason why the government attaches importance to Shanghai is because Shanghai has its leading position, and its position of contributing to the country. Shanghai has its dark side, and it also has its bright side, just as the whole of China also has its dark side and bright side. What Shanghai needs to change is to clear away its darkness and promote its brightness. We must sweep away the miasma in the midst of storms and return it to a bright world.

It is still Shanghai, before "August 19," it was often cursed by the whole country, but after "August 19" until today, in just three weeks, it has received the attention of the whole country. Chengdu has the call to "quickly learn from Shanghai," Beiping posted the slogan "Learn from Shanghai," and Guangzhou also said that "Guangzhou can also do what Shanghai has done." This is all the glory of Shanghai! And this glory is brought to us Shanghai people by the "change" led by Supervisor Chiang in the past twenty days. The Shanghai in the eyes of the common people, although still in the prelude period of storms, believes that the bright world will definitely come soon. If the governments and people of all regions can truly learn from Shanghai, learn from Shanghai, and do everything that Shanghai has done, then the common people will not only control Shanghai themselves, but the common people will also one day truly control China. Originally, Shanghai had a leading role in the country, and the common people of Shanghai supported this change with all their strength, and the glory of Shanghai can be maintained for a long time.

There is no doubt that the common people are now using their utmost enthusiasm to support Supervisor Chiang's strict and vigorous iron-fisted policy to promote this reform. The most innocent are the common people; the most pure are also the common people. The Shanghai and China that the common people currently hope for in their hearts is only a Shanghai and China with stable prices and a happy and peaceful life, without much extravagance, and to seek its stability and its peace, the root cause is only the word "rule of law". Whether it is suppressing chaos or building the country, all political, military, and economic measures, whether they are lenient or fierce, or relaxed or tense, cannot but use the law as a tool to correct chaos and restore order. "In times of chaos, use severe penalties," this is a well-known saying, and the so-called severe penalties are still within the scope of "law". The common people of Shanghai hope to beat tigers, catch scalpers, and swat flies. All those who violate laws and regulations, regardless of unscrupulous merchants, corrupt officials, local tyrants, or evil gentry, should be brought to justice and made to submit to the law without any complaint. This is the victory of the law, the victory of the common people. It is necessary to make the wealthy families and giants who were beyond the law in the past subject to the same laws as peddlers and hawkers. This is justice, this is fairness, this is the bright world that the common people hope for.

The financial and economic emergency measures order of "August 19" is the beginning of China's most urgent economic revolution, and it is only allowed to succeed, not allowed to fail. On the one hand, the common people are eagerly hoping that the authorities implementing the policy, from the central government to the local government, not just in Shanghai, will all stand in the homes of the people, strictly handle matters according to the law, without any accommodation. The law was originally formulated to protect the interests of the majority of the people, so enforcing the law is protecting the interests of the majority of the people. The law should be the fairest and most impartial. The punishment should not be heavier because the offender is a peddler or hawker, nor should the penalty be lighter because the offender is a wealthy family or giant, and vice versa. The common people have no extravagant hopes today. They only hope that the government authorities will all punish all those who violate laws and regulations based on the various laws specified in the emergency measures order, so that this "paradise of adventurers" will forever become the Shanghai of the rule of law, the Shanghai of the common people. Standing on the position of the common people, we applaud Supervisor Chiang's call and welcome the arrival of "the Shanghai of the common people!"

### Abundant Harvest from Blasting the Tiandu Iron Mine on Hainan Island

[Our newspaper, Haikou, 12th] A telegram from Yulin Port: The Tiandu Iron Mine of the Hainan Iron Mine Bureau successfully blasted the mine with explosives for the first time on the 10th, yielding approximately 100,000 dan of ore.

### Aluminum Mine Discovered on Kinmen Island; Taiwan Aluminum Company Decides to Trial Mine; There Must Be More Aluminum Mines Along the Coastal Areas of Fujian and Guangdong

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] Taiwan Aluminum Corporation recently discovered a high-grade aluminum mine on Kinmen Island, Fujian, and has decided to trial mine it and transport it to Taiwan for aluminum smelting. In the past, the company relied on aluminum mines in Southeast Asia as raw materials, importing 10,000 tons last year. In July this year, it originally planned to mine the aluminum mine in Zhangpu, Fujian. The geological expert Smithman of the American Reynolds Metals Company, who was sent by the company to take charge and accompany him to Fujian, accidentally discovered a wide distribution of laterite areas when he flew near Xiamen, overlooking Kinmen Island. Moreover, because the climate there is suitable for the formation of aluminum mines, he believed that the island might contain aluminum mines, so he immediately dispatched engineer Qiao Zhenli to conduct on-site survey and excavation. After testing the samples, it was proved to be aluminum ore, and its quality was better than that of Zhangpu. The estimated reserves are about 110,000 tons. The company has now established a trial mining institution. According to the company, the quality of the aluminum mine on Kinmen Island is very similar to that produced in Southeast Asia and is suitable for Bayer's method of extraction. However, the content of vaporized aluminum is slightly lower, and the content of silicate (SiO2) is slightly higher. Therefore, the amount of ore used in extraction will be slightly more than that of Southeast Asian ore. It is estimated that it takes about four tons of Southeast Asian ore to smelt one ton of pure aluminum, and five tons of Kinmen Island ore will be needed. Also, because the silicate is higher, the consumption of caustic soda during extraction will also be higher. It is estimated that the consumption of caustic soda will increase by about 50% per ton of aluminum smelted, which will slightly increase the company's production costs. However, because foreign exchange can be saved, it is still worth mining. Kinmen Island is only 30 kilometers away from Xiamen, and the ships are very convenient, and the public security is good. Because aluminum mines have now been discovered in Zhangpu and Kinmen Island one after another, the company believes that there must be other places along the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong that contain more aluminum mines.

### Fujian Provincial Assembly Cables the President Requesting Fujianese to Govern Fujian

[Our newspaper, Xiamen, 12th] The Fujian Provincial Assembly recently convened a resident committee because of a report that the provincial government was about to be reorganized, and firmly advocated that Fujianese should govern Fujian.

I implore you to adopt it and follow the trend."

### Yan Guofu's Conversation

Excess goods are related to tonnage; no suspicion of malpractice can be assumed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Yan Guofu, former director of the Shandong-Qingdao branch of the Executive Yuan, stated in a conversation with Wang Pingyi, director of the Shandong Social Affairs Department, on the 13th that the discovery of excess goods in the warehouse during the handover of the Shandong-Qingdao branch and the suspicion of malpractice was defended. It is said that the tonnage listed in the handover list was based on the long ton figures allocated by the head office with the personnel of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and the long ton was slightly longer than the metric ton. When distributing goods, this situation was included in the material overage account and reported to the head office. Therefore, the quantity of materials handed over exceeded the quantity recorded in the list, and this cannot be considered as malpractice.

### Zhenjiang Establishes a Branch Station to Recruit Youth for Military Service

### Beiping's "Tiger Fighting Support Association" Over a Thousand People Gather and March

They started from Tiananmen in the morning and passed through the Municipal Government and Dongsi, Dongdan, Xidan, and Xisi, shouting slogans along the way, shouting "Commander Chen (Jicheng) should learn from Xuan Tiewu (Yi)!", "Zhang Lisheng, show some courage!", "Mayor Liu, don't be silent!", "Use heads to stabilize prices!", "Down with the powerful families!" and so on.

### Changchun Prices Generally Stable

Rescuing the Dying Movement Saves More Than 8,000 People

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] Our military and civilians have been defending Changchun arduously for nearly four months. Due to the entry of airdrop supplies into a fixed-time and fixed-quantity schedule, and the completion of defense works on all lines, the hardships of the military and civilians for four months have been greatly comforted. Even this important town in the northeast has always stood tall with the heroic posture of being unbreakable by attack and indestructible by siege. The withered grass and fallen leaves here have reported that autumn is deep, and the cold frost is urging people to prepare to welcome the arrival of winter. The news of currency system reform seems to have given this isolated city, separated by land and air, a good impression. Over the past two weeks, prices have obviously been generally stable, and the upsurge of food prices has also stopped. The anxiety and tension of Changchun citizens for several months have been alleviated due to the stability of prices. Except for the occasional faint sound of gunfire, no one can directly feel that they are under siege by bandit troops. If the Changchun airport can safely receive aircraft landings at present, and the bank resumes opening internal remittances, Changchun can obtain full stability.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] According to statistics from the Civil Affairs Bureau of the city government, since the garrison launched the rescue-the-dying movement, as of the 12th of this month, more than 22.2 billion yuan of circulating notes have been issued for emergency relief, saving 8,520 poor people.

Also, Dong Zhao, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, will personally go to various counties to inspect and supervise the thorough implementation of economic reform measures in the coming days.

### Surprising Coal Mine Discovery in Hubei Province; Reserves Reach 3.5 Billion Edible Tons

[Our newspaper, Hankou, 12th] A surprising discovery of coal mine reserves in Hubei Province has recently been made. According to the survey statistics of the Department of Construction, the coal mine reserves in the province are approximately 3.556 billion tons. The main deposit areas are distributed in 19 counties, of which Zigui has the largest reserves, estimated at about 900 million tons; Puqi is second, estimated at about 600 million tons; and Yichang is next, estimated at about 400 million tons. Daye, the original famous coal mine production area, now only has 300 million tons, ranking fourth. In addition to actively planning for mining, the central Geological Survey has also sent personnel to western Hubei for exploration.

### Wuhu's Grain Market is Facing a Crisis; Yuxi Dongba Has a Tendency to Replace It; Rice Industry Giants and Opinion Leaders Call for Self-Reliance

[Our newspaper, Wuhu, 12th] The new building of the Wuhu Grain Market opened at No. 16 Huasheng Street on the 12th. Hundreds of members of the rice and transportation industries attended. Lü Shaohua presided over the ceremony. Members of the two industries expressed that the Wuhu Rice Market has been facing high labor costs recently. Grain imports and exports pass through Yuxi on the north bank of the Yangtze River and Dongba on the south bank, and are taxed and transshipped without passing through Wuhu. This crisis is still continuing. It costs 3.40 Jin Yuan for every stone of rice to move up and down, and there are other demands. Bao Cang, publisher of Wuhu Edition of the Grain Daily, believes that the 6% ad valorem self-defense special tax on grain in Anhui Province should be abolished, which is also a good medicine to reduce the export price of rice in Wuhu. Today, the four giants of the Wuhu rice industry, Li Nianci, Cai Yushu, Wang Zhupu, and Tao Yinhuai, did not attend the meeting. It is heard that they are dissatisfied with people outside the rice industry trying to control the grain market. The Wuhu Rice Market was originally formed by the division of the Zhenjiang Xiashi Rice Market. For decades, it has been engaged in collecting and distributing grain on both sides of the Yangtze River. Now, it is facing crises such as high expenses and uncoordinated personnel. The guidance and correction in the future depend on the efforts of the two departments of the Grain and Social Affairs and the self-reliance of the Wuhu rice industry. Otherwise, small rice markets such as Yuxi and Dongba will replace the ancient market opened by Li Hongzhang.

### Wuxi Again Seizes Hoarded Kerosene

[Our newspaper, Wuxi, 12th] The county government recently, together with the Suppression and Construction Team, seized 139 tins of hoarded kerosene at the Dachenghao in Zhoushanbang. The principal offender, Wang Zuocai, has been detained.

The prices in Hangzhou have been stable in recent days due to strict control, and there is no market for cotton yarn cloth.

### Black Market for Foreign Exchange in Xiamen Has Disappeared

Private Overseas Remittances of Private Letter Offices are Under Investigation

After cracking down on five companies including Jiesheng and Maohua a few days ago, they searched the Huaji and Shuntai money shops twice on the 10th. At present, the black market for foreign exchange has disappeared. Also, according to Mayor Huang, many private letter offices in the city have recently specialized in black market overseas remittances. Huang himself interrogated the responsible persons of the China, Jiangnan, and Dahua letter offices on the 10th. It is heard that the case is serious and may involve many black market letter offices.

### Haikou Lacks Subsidiary Currency; Difficult Trade in the Market

[Our newspaper, Haikou, 11th] Since the issuance of the Gold Yuan Coupons here, prices have stabilized and people's hearts have settled. However, most of the new banknotes issued by various banks are in denominations of five yuan and ten yuan, and there are very few subsidiary currencies of one yuan and below, making it difficult to make change, and trade in the market is almost at a standstill. Everyone hopes that subsidiary currencies of one corner and below can be transported here as soon as possible.

### Kangding Market Stable

The People of Kang and Tibet Believe in the Gold Yuan and Support the Government's Currency System Reform

[Our newspaper, Ya'an, 11th] Wang Yaokun, the Kangding city defense commander, came here on official business. According to him, since the central government changed the currency, the provincial government immediately implemented the implementation measures. All commodity prices are sold at the August 19 prices, and have not fluctuated so far, which is very good. The people of Kang and Tibet have great confidence in the new currency and strongly support the government's move. Recently, civil servants and citizens have been supplied with rice at flat prices and sold at the prices of a month ago, which is very convenient for the general public, and there is no problem with people's food.

### Changshan Islands Lack Grain; The Ring Island Road Has Been Completed

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 12th dispatch] Nine movie theaters in the capital city were all closed on the 12th to protest the tragedy that occurred at the National Grand Theater on the evening of the 11th. The 12th was a Sunday, and movie theaters in Nanjing were required to screen a free show for soldiers. The employees of the movie theaters still worked as usual.

### The Evins Embezzlement of Taiwan Gold Case; The U.S. Department of Justice Withdraws the Original Lawsuit; Legal Procedures Have Ended, Pending Diplomatic Negotiations

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th dispatch] The major case of U.S. Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Evins, who entered Taiwan with the Nationalist army at the time of Taiwan's recovery, embezzling a large amount of gold in Taiwan, although it has been publicly tried twice in the United States, was subsequently withdrawn by the U.S. Department of Justice and has now become an outstanding issue between China and the United States. It was recently learned from the Taiwan Provincial Government that when Evins arrived in Taiwan in October of the 34th year of the Republic, he learned from Japanese officer Harada Zuo that there were 120 kilograms of gold in Taiwan and secretly embezzled 60 kilograms, delivering only half of the remaining 60 kilograms to the former Taiwan Provincial Government for receipt. Evins subsequently sold the embezzled gold in Shanghai in November and then retired and returned to the United States. After the case was confirmed by Chinese and American personnel in the 35th year of the Republic, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit and held two public trials in Los Angeles, but both failed to reach a verdict due to the jury's inability to agree. The reporter recently learned from the Taiwan Provincial Government that the U.S. Department of Justice has withdrawn the original lawsuit. This case was once widely reported in Chinese and American newspapers and was closely watched by people in both countries. Now that the legal proceedings have ended, it will depend on diplomatic negotiations.

### Foreign Ministers' Representatives to Meet Today to Discuss the Issue of Italian Territories; Great Differences of Opinion Make Achievement Difficult

[United Press, Paris, 12th dispatch] The French Foreign Ministry announced on the 12th that the new Foreign Minister Schuman of the Guy Cabinet will lead the French delegation to the Foreign Ministers' meeting on the 13th. The Foreign Ministry also confirmed that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zixin Shen will represent the Soviet Union. The meeting will be held at the Foreign Ministry at 3:30 p.m. to discuss the guiding principles for the disposition of former Italian colonies. It has not yet been decided who will replace Secretary of State Marshall to attend on behalf of the United States.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th dispatch] The U.S. State Department's note to the Soviet Union was quickly answered tonight, rejecting the Soviet claim that the United States had violated the Treaty of Peace with Italy. This afternoon, the Soviet Union accused the U.S. suggestion that each country send only one Foreign Minister representative to participate in the Foreign Ministers' meeting as a violation of the Treaty of Peace with Italy. Tonight, the U.S. State Department delivered a note to the Soviet Embassy, stating that the dispatch of only one Foreign Minister representative to participate in the Foreign Ministers' meeting is a procedure that has precedents in previous Foreign Ministers' meetings. The note also pointed out that the United States cannot accept the Soviet claim that the meeting will be impossible to convene because only Marshall's representative is participating. The State Department stated that the United States has sent copies of its note to the Soviet Union to both Britain and France simultaneously.

According to the U.S. in a previous note to the Soviet Union, unless the Soviet Union offers new suggestions, the meeting will likely be unsuccessful.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 12th dispatch] Judging from the tone of the Soviet newspapers, the Soviet government is quite dissatisfied with Britain's dispatch of McNeil to participate in the Foreign Ministers' meeting instead of Bevin. The Soviet Union believes that this will make the progress of the meeting impossible.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th dispatch] Well-informed sources say that British representative to the United Nations General Assembly McNeil will take the following positions in Paris on Italy's five colonies in Africa: (1) Somalia: Britain does not object to placing the area under Italian trusteeship. (2) Eritrea: Britain advocates making it an autonomous territory under the government of Abyssinia. (3) Cyrenaica: Britain will maintain the promise made by British Foreign Secretary Eden to the Arab Chief Al-Khoulyusi in 1942 and will never return the area to Italy. (4) Tripolitania: Britain is inclined to follow the wishes of the 45,000 Italian residents. If they advocate returning to Italy, Britain will propose a plan to transfer the area to Italy. (5) Fezzan in Southern Tripolitania: The area was liberated by French General Leclerc's army, and the other residents have expressed dissatisfaction with French rule, so Britain intends to maintain the status quo of the area.

### Berlin Communist Mass Rally Appears in a Demonstrative Manner; Lustgarten Square Turns Red

[United Press, Berlin, 12th dispatch] Berlin's greatest red demonstration in history was held in Lustgarten Square today. Hundreds of long lines built of flesh and blood converged on the square like hundreds of rivers flowing to the sea. Singing The Internationale, around 11:30 a.m., 20,000 Germans had arrived at the square, which is located in the city center and was once known for its beautiful scenery at the northern end of "Unter den Linden" Avenue.

A slight breeze swept across people's temples, and huge red flags lazily stretched out in the breeze. Hundreds of small red flags, many with the Soviet hammer and sickle symbol, were held by the demonstrators. Lustgarten Square is located in the Soviet-occupied zone and is a traditional good location for demonstrations. The Communist Party launched a demonstration of 80,000 people on May Day, also held there. This conference coincides with the Soviet-proposed "Conference of Victims Under Fascism."

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th dispatch] According to sources close to well-informed individuals: Although the mass rally supported by the Communist Party has been determined to be a memorial for "victims under fascism," it will undoubtedly appear in a demonstrative manner. Its intention is to target the anti-communist demonstration two days ago. This meeting may even be a communist coup to seize power in Berlin. Today, the insurgents intend to propose to the conference a request to abolish the current Berlin municipal government, which is dominated by the Social Democratic Party, and replace it with a "progressive regime." It is rumored that after the demonstrators pass the resolution, they will march to the city government, where the newly elected municipal government will be established. Observers believe that this type of plan has its possibilities because it is consistent with the general communist methods. However, they believe that the Western occupying powers still occupy three-quarters of the city of Berlin. Under these circumstances, it is unknown how the communists can seize power in the entire Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 11th dispatch] The U.S. military government has prohibited any ceremonies to commemorate the victims under fascism, but Colonel Turbanov, head of the Soviet zone military government, has invited the "Berlin Association of Victims Under Fascism" to hold an exhibition in the Soviet zone.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 11th dispatch] Colonel Turbanov, head of the Information Bureau of the Soviet Military Government, delivered a speech at the "Memorial Meeting for Victims Under Fascism" today, stating, "Due to the assistance of British and French reactionaries, Berlin has powerful reactionary forces fighting strongly against progressive forces. At the same time that the Ku Klux Klan is in control in New York, the fascist elements in Berlin were able to tear up the Soviet red flag. The events in Berlin are merely a microcosm of similar events occurring around the world. I am sincerely not a diplomat, but I am an anti-fascist fighter. The power of the Soviet Union has destroyed the war machine of the Third Reich, and it will undoubtedly be able to destroy the forces attempting to organize the Fourth Reich."

### Britain Expresses Opposition to Delaying the Dismantling of German Factories

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th dispatch] The British government has opposed accepting the U.S. suggestion to delay the dismantling of factories in West Germany. According to responsible parties, this is because (1) delaying compensation or reducing the dismantling of factories seems likely to have a major reaction in the countries benefiting from the Marshall Plan, because they rely on German reparations for reconstruction. (2) Reducing the dismantling of factories will inevitably endanger neighboring countries by increasing Germany's industrial potential. (3) The British government believes that some German factories are currently idle due to a lack of raw materials. If they are moved to countries with sufficient raw materials, they can resume operation.

### Terror Shrouds East Germany; There are Group Massacres

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 11th dispatch] A "Memorandum on Terrorist Actions in the Soviet Zone" released by the Social Democratic Party reveals that mass graves of several massacred people have been found in eastern Germany.

### Soviet Embassy in the United States Releases Statement Urging Speedy Conclusion of Peace Treaty with Japan and Demanding that Allied Nations Withdraw Occupying Forces from Japan

[United Press, Washington, 11th dispatch] In the "Soviet News Bulletin" issued by the Soviet Embassy here on the 11th, there is an article written by Soviet journalist Garinov, claiming that the Soviet Union was the protagonist in defeating Germany and Japan. The article also states: The Soviet Union is demanding the speedy completion of a peace treaty with Japan and promoting the withdrawal of occupying forces. After the Red Army defeated the Japanese Kwantung Army, the rulers of Japan had no other choice but to request surrender terms. The article also stated: The Soviet Union insists on a speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan and the withdrawal of occupying forces. Three years ago, the Soviet army, on the orders of its government, participated in the war against Japan in order for the Soviet Union to achieve a noble goal, which is to end the war in the Far East. The article also criticized the United States for refusing the Soviet Union, Britain, China and other countries the right of veto in the Japanese peace conference.

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] Following the Soviet Union's sudden suggestion to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible and "quickly" withdraw the occupying forces, qualified Japanese observers stated: If the United States withdraws from Japan in the near future, it will be harmful rather than beneficial to Japan, because the Communist Party can arbitrarily stir up trouble and plunge the country into trouble. A senior Japanese official said: "The withdrawal of troops is a very dangerous attempt and is exactly what the Soviet Union wants.

[United Press, Paris, 11th dispatch] Guy's financial plan, apart from the details, is nothing more than a reprise of the financial plan that Marie and Schuman twice submitted to Congress earlier this month. Both Marie and Schuman resigned because the plan failed to pass Congress. But at this time, all parties are well aware that other plans for financial reform have failed, and at the same time, it may even end the "Third Force" centrist regime in France.

### Japan Plans to Form Anti-Communist Committee to Investigate Japanese Communist Party Activities

Many Young Students Tend to Lean Left

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] Japanese lawmakers are planning to form a committee in the Diet to investigate "anti-Japanese activities." The planned committee will investigate the activities of the Japanese Communist Party, as it is generally criticized for obstructing Japan's industrial reconstruction. At the same time, the financial background of the Japanese Communist Party's ability to support its various active activities is also under investigation, as the source of the Japanese Communist Party's finances remains a mystery to this day. The initiators of this movement declined to discuss the scope of the committee, but said that the entire discussion will be held at a special session of the Diet next month. Kobayashi, the Secretary-General of the Upper House and one of the initiators, said that he favored setting up the committee in the Upper House rather than in the Lower House, as in the United States. He also said that in fact, the Judicial Committee of the Japanese Diet has already carried out similar actions.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] In the three years since the war, Japanese politics has become increasingly conservative, even to the point of exceeding the pre-war level. This is because political power is still in the hands of general old bureaucrats and politicians. Therefore, after suffering, Japanese youths have mostly joined various anti-government groups. According to a report from the Ministry of Education instructing all 405 national, public, and private universities and junior colleges to investigate the situation of student groups, the vast majority of students belong to left-leaning groups such as "Communist Party cells," "Young Communist League," and "Social Science Research Association." This tendency is especially prevalent in national schools. Politicians with general foresight are deeply worried about this phenomenon.

A Reader of This Newspaper Generously Donates One Thousand Yuan for Maternity and Education Assistance

Our long-time reader, Mr. Le Sifu, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown for business. He took the opportunity to donate one thousand gold yuan to this newspaper, half of which will be used for the "Reader's Education Assistance Fund" and the remainder for the "Reader's Maternity Assistance Fund." According to Mr. Le, his ancestral home is in Zhejiang, but his great-grandfather moved to Hunan for business. He has been reading this newspaper for over twenty years without interruption. Upon arriving in Shanghai for business, he noticed the large number of out-of-school youth and impoverished pregnant women and decided to donate this sum to fulfill his civic duty.

Note: Although the fundraising for this year's "Reader's Education Assistance Fund" has exceeded the target, the high tuition fees of various schools still leave many applicants unassisted. We hope readers from all walks of life will generously donate to provide timely assistance to these impoverished youth.

Renji Hospital's Expanded Wards Open for Public Viewing Yesterday

[Report from this Newspaper]
Renji Hospital, located at 145 Shandong Middle Road, received a substantial donation from the China Relief Organization and funds allocated by the hospital's board of directors. The hospital has built new rooms in all available spaces on the balconies of various floors to expand the wards. This project has been completed, and the hospital hosted a public viewing for all sectors of society yesterday from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Yesterday, this reporter was guided by Zang Tongchang, the hospital's chief accountant, to visit various departments. The newly built rooms were still wet with paint and will be used as nurses' dormitories, first-class maternity rooms, and special-class patient rooms. The best of the special-class rooms cost approximately ten gold yuan per day, while the ordinary wards are spacious and well-lit, costing only eight jiao of gold yuan per day. The hospital previously had eleven special-class beds, ten first-class beds, forty-three second-class beds, and two hundred and sixty third-class beds. The new building adds ten special-class beds, seventeen first-class beds, thirty-three second-class beds, and forty third-class beds. The hospital is well-equipped, with some injections and medications made in-house at lower prices than those on the market, with specialized pharmacists in charge. The X-ray department already had several X-ray machines, and recently, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) donated a large X-ray machine, estimated to be worth $40,000 USD. One of the bulbs was damaged during transportation but has been replaced from the United States and will be available for use soon. The hospital has fifty-nine doctors, all graduates of reputable domestic universities such as St. John's, Shanghai Medical College, Tongji, and Tongde, as well as those who have studied abroad. Yesterday was Sunday, and outpatient services were suspended, but many emergency patients arrived and were treated immediately, which was convenient for the patients' families.

冒充經濟警察　意圖索詐被拘
Impersonating Economic Police, Attempting Extortion, Arrested

[Report from this Newspaper]
Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, a man in civilian clothes, about thirty years old, came to the China Confectionery Company at 165 Honggong Tanggu Road. He pointed to the wine in the display window and claimed that it was being sold above the price limit. He identified himself as an economic investigator from the police station and stated that selling above the price limit would result in a two-day suspension of business. Only the housewife and some apprentices were in the store at the time, and in her panic, she pleaded to avoid the penalty. Seeing that she was an easy target, the man said he would return at 8:00 PM to enforce the penalty.

When the store owner returned and learned what had happened, he knew that the wine was being sold in compliance with the law and that he had records to prove it. Instead of waiting for the man to return, he went to the Hongkou Police Station to explain the situation. Section Chief Xu Shibin, after investigating the incident, ordered officer Song Hanshui and auxiliary police officer Zhang Kunyuan to go to the store to verify the facts.

At 8:00 PM, the man arrived as promised. Officer Song confronted him and quickly realized that his statements were evasive. When asked for identification, it was discovered that he was an impostor attempting extortion. He was immediately arrested. The man's name is Huang A'gen, and he is currently being interrogated by the Hongkou Police Station.

Transportation Company Adopts Fuel Savers to Improve Operations

In order to save gasoline, maintain operations, and conserve foreign exchange, the Preparatory Committee of the Public Utilities Bureau's Public Transportation Company, under the direction of Zhao Zengjue, the concurrent chairman, instructed the committee's technical team leader, Miao Ji, to actively research the installation of fuel savers. He also collaborated with Xu Mingcai, the director of the Central Chemical Factory Preparatory Office of the Resources Committee, to research and manufacture carbon-clearance crystals needed to save gasoline. Practical experiments were conducted in July and August, showing particularly positive results for buses traveling through busy urban areas. The Transportation Company is now manufacturing its own fuel savers and will begin testing them on the Route 3 bus line starting next week. It is reported that these fuel savers can save about one-tenth of the gasoline in areas with many traffic lights. If successful on Route 3, they will be tested on busy routes such as Routes 10 and 14. However, the fuel-saving effect of these fuel savers is not significant in areas with few traffic lights.

Citywide People's Service Stations Convene Letter-Box Chiefs' Meeting Yesterday, Urging Citizens to Report Illegal Merchants

In order to implement the new economic decrees, Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo specifically ordered the People's Service Stations in each district of the Suppression Banditry Brigade to convene letter-box chiefs' meetings. The ten service stations throughout the city convened letter-box chiefs' meetings in the morning and afternoon yesterday. The station chiefs, representing Jiang Jingguo, declared the government's determination to implement economic reforms. They urged citizens to cooperate closely with the government to achieve success. They stated that if the economic policies were obstructed and failed, the foundation would collapse, and the people would suffer the most. Therefore, they urged citizens to assist the government in promoting economic inspection at the grassroots level by "focusing on small matters" and reporting merchants who illegally raise retail prices. The station chiefs also stated that the government has absolute control over resources, and this is not just empty talk to stabilize public morale. Facts will soon demonstrate this, and they hope that citizens will adopt a calm and composed attitude and endure this transitional period with perseverance.

鎮壓物價的蔣經國　並非是傳奇中人物　昨應漁管處邀與記者羣同作浦江之遊
Jiang Jingguo, Who Suppresses Prices, Is Not a Legendary Figure; Yesterday, He Accepted an Invitation from the Fisheries Administration to Cruise the Huangpu River with a Group of Reporters

[Special Report from This Newspaper]
In recent years in Shanghai, whenever prices rose or the economy and finance fluctuated, rumors would circulate that the central government had sent a high-ranking official to Shanghai to investigate and supervise. As a result, the rising tide of prices would gradually recede. Everyone was curious about who this high-ranking official was who possessed the "power" to suppress prices. No one could say for sure, but it was always said to be Jiang Jingguo.

After the August 19th currency reform, Jiang Jingguo finally appeared before the people of Shanghai as the Economic Supervisor of the Executive Yuan. In the two weeks since his office was established, he has rarely made any public statements, and his photos have not been seen in newspapers. However, the "tigers" whom no one dared to offend in the past are being taken down one by one without any favoritism. Warehouses filled with three months' worth of gauze are being confiscated, regardless of the owners' backgrounds. Anyone who raises prices is being investigated and arrested. This unprecedented, radical approach has finally anchored the Shanghai price market, which was accustomed to causing trouble. In the month since August 19th, price fluctuations have been kept to a minimum. The general public is celebrating and relieved. However, people on the streets are still talking about Jiang Jingguo, even regarding him as a legendary figure.

Hair Tousled, He Steps Onto the Boat

Yesterday afternoon, Director Zhao of the Fisheries Administration prepared a fishing boat and invited the press to cruise the Huangpu River. Jiang Jingguo gladly accepted the invitation. The three or four hours of contact deeply impressed people that he is not a legendary figure. On the contrary, he is unpretentious, down-to-earth, and knows how to get things done.

Most of the journalists were dressed impeccably, as they were invited for a holiday outing. However, Jiang Jingguo stepped onto the boat wearing a white short-sleeved Hong Kong shirt, yellow woolen army pants, and black leather shoes. His hair was ungreased and tousled by the wind. He is not very tall, but his sturdy physique and strong hands gave the impression of a man full of perseverance and determination. He brought an older-style reflex camera and chatted and joked with the reporters, eagerly taking photos of them.

Answering Everything with Laughter

The slightly nervous reporters, encountering such a topical news subject, were eager to ask questions. One asked about his impressions of Shanghai, another about his determination to fight "tigers," and another about the need for connections to get housing and telephones, and the exorbitant prices charged by rickshaw pullers. One reporter even said that he had heard that a powerful group in Shanghai was planning to fight against him and bring him down in two months. Everything was discussed, from the trivial to the important, from the past to the present, the lighthearted and the provocative. Jiang Jingguo responded to everything with a laugh. After all, this was a leisurely river cruise, and why should these questions spoil the mood?

Spending Most of the Time Sunbathing

On the boat, everyone was afraid of the sun and tried to find seats in the shade of the canopy. Jiang Jingguo, however, found a chair in the full sunlight. After sitting for a while, he took off his short-sleeved Hong Kong shirt, leaving only a tank top. For most of the time on the boat, he was seen sunbathing. Perhaps this demonstrated his disdain for hypocrisy, his pursuit of practicality, and his spirit of facing the light and seeking the truth.

Director Gao of the Supervisor's Office said: "Mr. Jiang is thirty-nine years old this year. He attended Wan Bamboo Elementary School and Pudong High School. Afterwards, he went to Moscow's Sun Yat-sen University to major in mechanical engineering and study political economics, graduating with honors. During his internship in a Moscow factory, he met a Russian colleague, fell in love, and married. He is now the father of three children."

Doing What Is Beneficial to the Public Before Anything Else

This experience, in terms of innate conditions, is not particularly special. Almost any child from a middle-class family, or even a diligent scholar from a poor family, could complete this experience. Whether or not they are diligent and practical is the key to success. What makes him different is perhaps that he can disregard everything and do what is beneficial to the public before anything else. However, Director Gao humbly said in his brief speech on the boat yesterday: "The work of the Economic Supervisor's Office is social work and requires the power of public opinion to mobilize all levels of society to participate in this arduous task to achieve success."

Director Zhao Junmai of the Fisheries Administration said it well: "Mr. Jiang Jingguo is a master of magic. It's a pity that we didn't bring any props on the boat yesterday; otherwise, he could have shown off his skills on the spot." But perhaps he has a set of endless magic tricks for Shanghai's prices and economy, and will always keep them as calm as the waves on the river yesterday!

「鎳禍」在成都
"The Nickel Disaster" in Chengdu

本報記者周學端
By Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan

〔本報成都七日航訊〕
[Airlifted Report from Chengdu, This Newspaper, 7th]
Since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, it has caused a generally positive response in Chengdu, with the people of all of Sichuan enthusiastically embracing this epoch-making economic reform. Unfortunately, immediately following the currency reform, a wave of universally accepting new and old nickel coins swept through Chengdu, agitating the entire market and causing unprecedented social chaos. This is what people call the "Nickel Disaster," which includes: unprecedented corruption by those in charge of economic controls, speculative profiteering, panic buying of all goods, and various strange phenomena such as the market being without prices or trade. This is the most unreasonable phenomenon in the economic suppression of banditry.

通用鎳幣
General Use of Nickel Coins

The so-called new and old nickel coins include copper coins (1 fen), nickel coins (5 fen, 10 fen, 20 fen), and alloy coins (5 fen, 10 fen, 20 fen, half-yuan) minted by the Central Mint from 1937 to 1941, with a total发行amount of approximately over 400 million yuan. Most of them were minted in Chengdu, so they were mostly used near Chengdu. Because they were legal tender auxiliary coins, they had long been abandoned and unused, purchased by the ton for the manufacture of light metal utensils. Some small factories have secretly hoarded several tons. On the 20th, when the new economic policy was announced, it was widely rumored that the Chengdu branch of the Central Bank had received a notice to universally accept them. As a result, speculative trading of nickel coins became rampant, lasting all night, with tens of thousands of people gathered on the streets competing to buy and sell, forming lines more than ten miles long, an unprecedented scene. In the meantime, the Central Bank was used as a base, constantly spreading rumors, causing fluctuations in coin prices, and making speculators go crazy, with some groups manipulating the market from behind the scenes. It wasn't until the航郵copy of this newspaper (dated the 21st) arrived on the 24th, and a news reporter showed the Central Bank's advertisement for the issuance of auxiliary coins to Yang Xiaoci, the manager of the Chengdu Central Bank, that Yang's face suddenly turned pale, and he repeatedly exclaimed, "Oh no, oh no!" At that time, he began to notify the municipal government to announce that all new and old nickel coins would be universally accepted. In those few days of the nickel rush, some people became wealthy overnight, while others were ruined, truly a case of some rejoicing while others grieving.

Panic Buying and Market Chaos

Due to the wide circulation of nickel coins in the past, coupled with the time difference between the issuance of the currency reform order and the announcement of the universal acceptance of nickel coins, speculators tried their best to purchase them in the counties surrounding Chengdu. As a result, the nickel rush flooded the entire city of Chengdu as soon as the nickel coins began to be universally accepted. First, speculators and those with abundant old hoards frantically bought up goods. On the afternoon of the 25th, tens of thousands of people holding nickel coins crowded the prosperous urban areas, scrambling to buy goods. Within three hours, all the goods in department stores and shops in the commercial center of Chengdu, Chunxi Road, were completely bought up. After the 26th, the entire city fell into unprecedented chaos. Any shop that opened its doors was immediately looted. Later, it became a case of buying everything regardless of price or use, with everyone panicking and not knowing what to do. A few merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, while most closed their doors and suspended business. Originally, prices in Chengdu were lower than those in Beijing and Shanghai. Due to the ratio between gold, silver, legal tender, and gold yuan in the currency reform, prices had already jumped several times. The provincial and municipal authorities were unable to decisively control prices when they did not rise, and they also failed to quickly prevent and deal with the situation when nickel coins were openly traded. By the time the nickel rush flooded the market, forming a distorted currency inflation, with the supply of goods unable to meet demand, and prices fluctuating drastically, they were in a rush to artificially suppress prices. Although the municipal government repeatedly declared that it would "borrow heads" to stabilize prices, the market supply and demand had already been out of balance. Goods were being hoarded and not sold. From the 27th to today, daily necessities such as rice, flour, meat, and fuel have completely disappeared from the market. Most citizens have no meat to eat and are waiting for food to cook, with getting a meal considered a rare fortune. This is a phenomenon that has not been seen in Chengdu for decades.

央行經理　難辭其咎
Central Bank Manager Cannot Evade Responsibility

The Chengdu branch of the Central Bank bears the main responsibility for causing this nickel rush in Chengdu. The illegal corruption of Yang Xiaoci, the manager of the bank, is difficult to excuse, leading to popular resentment and public criticism. For days, telegrams denouncing the bank's corruption have been sent to the President and Premier Weng by all the legislators residing in Chengdu, representatives of the National Assembly from Sichuan, Kang, and Chongqing, the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, the Chengdu Municipal Assembly, mass organizations throughout Sichuan, the Sichuan Supervision Office, and the Chengdu Special Criminal Court, who have also filed public denunciations. According to the investigation, the truth about the Central Bank's corruption is as follows: After the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures were announced on the evening of the 19th, the Chengdu Central Bank received an电order from the head office on the 21st to universally accept the coins. Yang Xiaoci, the manager of the bank, was vague and evasive in his talks with reporters, but on the one hand, he secretly dispatched confidants with more than 700 billion legal tender to various places to purchase large quantities of coins at low prices, using his authority. At the same time, from directors to servants, as well as small and large economic groups of banks and commercial firms closely related to the bank, all made claims for all their holdings, day and night, and used various methods to search for large quantities in the urban area and the counties surrounding Chengdu. On the other hand, the Central Bank telegraphed the head office, using explanation as a pretext, to delay the situation. By the time it was forced to announce the policy, the average profit of general illegal speculators within a few days was more than twenty times. Therefore, the universal acceptance of nickel coins led to the nickel rush, panic buying of goods. So the rise of the nickel rush is universally recognized as being caused by the corruption of the Central Bank, with popular sentiment indignant, and everyone calling for a thorough investigation. In the nickel rush, many people's long-term private preparations were purchased by others, leading to friends becoming enemies, families becoming discordant, and several cases of murder and suicide occurring in a single day. Nickel rush! Nickel rush! The nickel rush brought decades of unprecedented suffering to the citizens of Chengdu.

Wujin Xueyan Bridge Robbery Case Solved, Secret Meeting Room of Bandits Discovered, More Than Twenty Loads of Stolen Cocoons Recovered

[Report from This Newspaper, Wujin, 12th]
At midnight on the 6th of this month, the Yimin Lan Firm in Xihuai Village, west of Xueyan Bridge, which collects cocoons for the Yousheng Silk Factory in Wuxi, was suddenly robbed by more than twenty bandits accompanied by two yellow and black German shepherd dogs. They broke into the house and looted for more than two hours, taking away more than twenty-five loads of dry cocoons (worth 30 billion yuan) packed in three small boats. Afterwards, the owner reported the incident to the county, offering a reward of one-third of the value of the stolen goods for information leading to the arrest of the bandits. The criminal police team was dispatched and found that Zhou Rongda, a vagrant in Caojia Village near Tianjing Bridge, was highly suspicious. After跟踪him to Wuxi and observing him secretly, he was arrested when he returned from Wuxi to Changzhou via Danyang. He confessed to the crime and implicated the bandit leaders Lu Daonan and Zhang Tao. On the morning of the 11th, the team led more than forty police officers and drove to Wang Zong祠in Caojia Village to search for the stolen goods. They also searched the house of traitorous bandit Kuang Hanzheng in Kuangjia Village. After a long search, they discovered the secret room where the bandits Lu Daonan and others regularly held meetings, and all the stolen goods were recovered. The suspects Kuang Zhihui, Kuang Xiu, and Shu Rongchang were also taken into custody. When the boat was passing through Tianjing, it was intercepted, but fortunately, there were no casualties in the counterattack. They arrived in the city that night, and the criminals were handed over to the county for interrogation, and the goods were notified to be claimed.

戡亂期間都市徵兵改進意見
Suggestions for Improving Urban Conscription During the Bandit Suppression Period

傅  溥正模
Fu Puzhengmo

A. Investigating and implementing conscription is an indispensable condition for establishing a country, which is an undeniable fact. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the foundation of military administration was destroyed by the enemy, and the old morals also declined. Although there was an opportunity for reorganization after the war, the communist bandits also launched a rebellion, so the investigation and control of保甲cannot be sound, the implementation of government orders cannot be thorough, and the local wealthy and powerful forces have become deeply rooted. Therefore, the implementation of regular conscription is not only difficult to carry out, delaying the replenishment of soldiers, but also the practice of substitution and evasion of military service has spread throughout the country. As for allowing volunteers to enlist, it has become a mercenary system, with soldier brokers rampant, desertion increasing, poor quality of soldiers, and spies mixing in, which wastes manpower and resources and weakens combat strength, with extremely deep harm. In order to cope with the needs of bandit suppression, prevent the wealthy from evading military service, strengthen the quality of soldiers, and truly promote the military system, I would like to offer my humble opinion based on the principle of those who have money contributing money and those who have strength contributing strength, so that it can be improved.

B. Implementation methods

2. Remedying Investigation and Control and Establishing a Military Administration System:

The reasons for inaccurate household registration investigations are twofold: (1) 保甲chiefs each have their own occupation, are weak in ability, and cannot be dedicated to their responsibilities; (2) 保甲chiefs fear power and influence, act perfunctorily, and dare not implement the system effectively. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that:

(1) The head of each district (town) shall concurrently serve as the commander of the large militia battalion for men of conscription age, under which there shall be several militia platoons for men of conscription age, organized by保. The unit should be composed of men of conscription age from the age of twenty to twenty-five.

(2) The platoon leader shall be elected by the保民 representative at the保民 conference from among the sons of wealthy people between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five who are studying or living in the city. The保chief shall serve as the deputy platoon leader, and the保team deputy and甲chief shall serve as the platoon deputies.

(3) The platoon leader shall be fully responsible for investigation, control, and command. All matters related to military administration shall be handled by the platoon leader in accordance with the orders of the district (9) town leader. If there is any concealment or dereliction of duty, they shall be the first to be called to military service and shall be re-elected.

(4) The保team deputy shall be responsible for administrative affairs, and the保甲chief shall be responsible for assisting.

(5) After the formation of the platoon, the names, ages, and addresses of the members shall be publicly announced in accordance with the law. If there are any errors or omissions, rewards shall be given for reporting or applying.

(6) The head of the household (guardian) shall be responsible for ensuring that the members of their household (family) never evade military service. Each member shall guarantee each other that they will never evade military service and shall provide a joint guarantee to the platoon leader for safekeeping after the formation of the platoon.

3. Tightening the Scope of Exemption from Military Service:

(1) "Men of the Republic of China have an obligation to serve in the military," as stated in the Constitution. As for the provisions of Article 24 of the Military Service Law regarding the deferment of students, it is to avoid hindering the education of the majority of students, but in fact, the sons of wealthy people often use this to evade military service; secondly, the number of students in school and the number of potential draftees are vastly different, which will not hinder the education of the entire student body; thirdly, according to the implementation of this article, the soldiers recruited are not only not intellectuals, but also poor people, creating a situation in which the poor protect the rich, which greatly affects the morale of the military; fourthly, the second paragraph of Article 24 of the Military Service Law, "Students who are recruited into the army after graduation shall complete reserve cadre education," has not yet been implemented. Because students have not served as soldiers, it not only greatly affects the knowledge level of soldiers, but also gives rise to the notion that the rich never serve in the military. Therefore, the second paragraph of Article 24 of the Military Service Law should be temporarily suspended.

(2) National officials, military officers, military dependents, shop employees, and ordinary employees of factories and mines

### First Prime Minister of Palestine, Jinnah, Dies in Karachi; Foreign Minister Wang Shijie Sends Condolences by Telegram

[United Press, Bombay, 11th] India News Agency, 11th dispatch: Jinnah, the creator of Pakistan and its first prime minister, died of illness in Karachi late on the 10th, at the age of 71. The news agency quoted a Pakistani public announcement as saying that Jinnah died at 10:25 pm on the 10th in the capital of Pakistan, which is currently celebrating its first anniversary. This "Great Leader" of tens of millions of Muslims in Pakistan and other parts of the Indian peninsula had been ill for some time.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Prime Minister of Pakistan Jinnah passed away on the 7th. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie sent a telegram on the 12th to the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, expressing deep condolences.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 12th] Pakistan will declare a 40-day national mourning period to commemorate its founding father and first Governor-General, Jinnah. Jinnah's position in Pakistan was more than that of a constitutional head of state. His death leaves a difficult-to-fill rift in the politics of the newly established Pakistan. Observers here predict that there will be no adverse political developments in Pakistan in the near future. Current Prime Minister Ali Khan will continue to lead the country. The impact of Jinnah's death on Pakistan's future cannot be determined at this time. Whether political forces will tend towards progress or reaction will become more apparent in the future.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 12th] Governor-General of India Rajagopalachari and Prime Minister Nehru, on behalf of the Indian government and people, offered condolences for Jinnah's death. The Pakistani government said: "We express our deepest condolences for the death of His Excellency Governor-General Jinnah, and to commemorate Jinnah's death, all Indian government offices will fly flags at half-mast." The Indian Governor-General also cancelled all receptions for diplomatic envoys today.

[Agence France-Presse, Deccan, 12th] When Pakistan Radio broadcast the news of Jinnah's death this morning, the people here were stunned. The radio station immediately canceled all its daily programs and only broadcast elegies and the Quran. All private social banquets were also canceled, and people went to mosques to hold mourning ceremonies for their leader. It is not yet known when Jinnah's funeral will be held, but the three ministers of Pakistan here have already hired a special plane to go to Karachi to attend Jinnah's funeral.

### Jinnah's Biography

— From our newspaper's data room

Jinnah, the creator of Pakistan and its first Prime Minister, passed away in Karachi on the 10th of this month at the age of 71.

Jinnah and Gandhi were both the most important figures in modern Indian history. They represented different religions and had particularly divergent political views, but they shared the same desire to seek independence and freedom for India. After India broke away from British rule and became independent, it was divided into two countries: India and Pakistan. The partition of Pakistan was the goal of Jinnah's lifelong efforts.

Jinnah was born in Karachi on Christmas in 1876. He went to England to study in his youth and began practicing law at the age of 20. After returning to India, he was elected chairman of the All-India Muslim League in 1916. After that, he became the political leader of all the Muslims in India and participated in the Anglo-Indian Round Table Conference to discuss the Indian question in 1929.

Jinnah's most important ideal was the autonomy of the Muslim people within India. He believed that due to the various differences between Muslims and Hindus in religion and lifestyle, a perfect result would be difficult to achieve without partition. This was the opposite of Gandhi's idea, because Gandhi advocated unity. Jinnah insisted strongly on the separation of India and Pakistan, and after many setbacks, he finally succeeded. On August 15 last year, India broke away from British rule and became independent, and the Muslim state of Pakistan was born.

Jinnah was tall and serious, and he looked like a calm and capable politician. He often wore a suit, and his home life was very simple. Jinnah's wife passed away many years ago, and his daughter became estranged from him after she converted to Christianity after marriage. In his later years, Jinnah lived with his sister in Karachi. At the beginning of this year, there were rumors that his health was deteriorating, and now he has suddenly passed away.

### The Suppression and Propaganda Task Force Expands Broadcasting Propaganda; Citizens Must Still Work Hard to Complete Three Revolutions

In order to assist the government in promoting currency system reform, eliminating bandit plots, and practicing economy, the Shanghai Suppression and Propaganda Task Force held an expanded publicity campaign yesterday at the Shanghai Radio Station. All public and private radio stations in the city rebroadcast the lectures from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. First, Fang, director of the Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang, broadcast, saying: (1) The currency system reform has been implemented for more than 20 days, and the situation is quite good, but we must still strictly prevent a small number of unscrupulous merchants from secretly raising prices and trying to revive the black market. Everyone is now supporting Inspector Jiang in fighting tigers, but Mr. Jiang is here to supervise us in fighting tigers. The actual tiger fighting work still requires all citizens to work together under his leadership. At the same time, fighting tigers is not for the government, but for the citizens themselves, and fighting tigers must be thorough and deadly, otherwise the tiger will revive and still eat people.

Practicing Economy and Contributing to Suppression and Reconstruction

(2) In addition to unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai, there are also Communist spies lurking in the market, causing trouble, raising the black market, and undermining the currency system. Today, the Communists and unscrupulous merchants have become one. Therefore, we must eliminate Communist spies at the same time to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihood. (3) Reforming the currency system without practicing economy will still not succeed. We should cherish material resources, financial resources, human resources, and time to contribute to the suppression of chaos and national construction, thereby enriching materials and stabilizing prices. Finally, Fang concluded that currency system reform is the current economic revolution, eliminating Communist spies and eliminating corruption is a political revolution, and comprehensive economy is a lifestyle revolution. To make all three points successful, the Shanghai compatriots must first carry them out thoroughly as a model for the whole country. This is the responsibility of the Shanghai compatriots and also the glory of the Shanghai compatriots.

Eliminating the Source of Chaos and Stabilizing Society

Then, Mayor Wu, representing Wang Zhaoquan, broadcasted, saying: "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every citizen." Citizens should not give up the right to advise on national affairs, nor should they evade the obligation to implement national policies. Currency system reform is to adapt to the needs of the times and is related to the success or failure of the suppression of chaos. Everyone must sincerely support it and trust it completely so that the new currency system will be successful. Next, Fan Heyan, representing President Yu of the Central Bank, broadcasted: We must eliminate the Communists and the unscrupulous merchants who are insane and hoard for their own benefit, and strictly prevent them from undermining the new currency system. At the same time, to improve the social economy, we must save consumption and distribute the materials saved by the wealthy class to the majority of people who cannot survive. This is a necessary condition for eliminating the source of chaos and stabilizing society.

Many Programs are Quite Exciting

Next, Wang Xiaozhu broadcasted, saying: Communist bandits are acute murderers, and unscrupulous merchants are chronic murderers. We must eliminate these two major evils to survive, and advise the people of the city to practice economy. In addition, Jin Zhenwang and others also broadcasted separately, and their feelings were very sincere. The programs were quite exciting, including various songs and operas compiled by the task force to support the government's currency reform, elimination of traitors, and economy.

### Police Power Unification Commemoration Conference Commander Xuan Instructs Three Points; Encourage to Love the People

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday was the third anniversary of the unification of police power in the city. The Municipal Police Bureau held a simple and solemn ceremony at 9:00 am in the square of the bureau. Director Yu presided over the ceremony. More than 500 officers and police officers and persons in charge of various sub-bureaus attended. Former Director Xuan was also invited to attend and give instructions on three points: (1) After the unification of police power, the work should reverse the past style of the patrol room in the concession era, assist the people, love the people, and truly become the nanny of the people. (2) Persist in a consistent firm style and continue to work hard to eliminate all the stains in Shanghai society without any slackness. Especially when the government promulgates a new economic reform plan, the mission of the police officers is even more important, and they must fully assist in promoting this work to achieve the goal of "only success is allowed, no failure is allowed" instructed by the President. (3) Review the police administration in the past three years. Although great gains and achievements have been made in public security, the work of road police still needs to be strengthened.

### Those Who Love the People are Supported by the People

[Reported by this newspaper] The Youth Army Friendship Association held a members' meeting at the Municipal Gymnasium on South Shanxi Road at 9:00 am yesterday, and invited Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo and Fang Zhi, director of the Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang, to give speeches. More than 2,000 demobilized youth soldiers and thousands of citizens who automatically came to the gymnasium to participate attended the meeting. Later arrivals could not be accommodated in the meeting place, and most of them gathered on the roads of South Shanxi Road and Central Linsen Road to listen to the speeches broadcast from the loudspeakers in front of the gymnasium. In his speech, Jiang vehemently criticized corrupt officials, wealthy and unscrupulous merchants, and firmly stated his confidence that the new economic policy would succeed. His words were passionate and aroused thunderous applause from the military and the masses attending the meeting. The excitement and enthusiasm of the meeting were unprecedented. After Jiang finished his speech, the meeting passed a draft of the Youth Service National Plan and a telegram to the President. At 11:20 am, the meeting ended in music and slogans. Jiang Jingguo left the meeting place, and the Friendship Association led the way with a guide. Thousands of people outside the gymnasium cheered wildly. Traffic on South Shanxi Road was already blocked. Hundreds of residents in the Zhabei District welcomed him in a procession with flags and gongs. The cheers and applause shook the buildings. Before Jiang got into the car, he was surrounded by the people again. The sincerity of the citizens' support and love for Jiang was fully demonstrated in front of the gymnasium yesterday morning. This situation was only seen after the victory when the President first came to Shanghai and accepted the cheers of the people on the balcony of the Municipal Government.

Should Not Over-Enjoy

Jiang's speech first pointed out the poverty of our country, and people should not enjoy too much to pretend to be rich. He said: When I was young, I saw people eating meat every day, but my family didn't have it. My grandmother told me that people had money, but my family didn't have money. Now our country is the same. Our country is poor, and most people don't have enough food and clothing, but some people are sitting in cars that they shouldn't be sitting in and enjoying materials that they shouldn't be enjoying, foreign perfumes, and silk stockings. These things are enough to destroy our national economy. We are poor, and being poor is not terrible. Why do we want to pretend to be rich? But now there is a group of people who are anesthetized by gold, US dollars, and foreign goods, and forget about the nation and the country. Taking Shanghai as an example, how many people can indulge in extravagance? Absolutely a minority. Our country will not allow these minorities to destroy it. We must kill these unfilial descendants of the Yellow Emperor one by one.

China's Survival Depends on National Justice

The reason why China can survive to this day is because there is an underlying national integrity that will never succumb to the enemy. There are many precedents in history, such as Wen Tianxiang, Shi Kefa, and Yue Fei. Whenever the nation is at the final moment of life and death, the whole people rise up and defeat the enemy. During the "July 7th" Incident, Japan challenged us with such a great force. We disregarded everything and resisted the war, and finally defeated Japan. The Communists are implementing the policies of other countries and undermining unity and peace. We must never compromise with them. Some people doubt why we cannot form a coalition government? Yes, we will not be fooled by the Communists. Czechoslovakia can become today's Czechoslovakia, and Romania can become today's Romania. China, which has a glorious national tradition and spirit, must not change.

New Economic Policy is a Turning Point in the Crisis

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was in Xichang, Xikang Province, and saw many well-built government office buildings there. I felt very strange. Later, the leader told me that these houses were prepared for the retreat from Chongqing. China resisted the war with weakness against strength. We had the determination to persevere to the end and finally won the victory. The current situation is a crisis and a turning point for the Chinese nation. The promulgation of the new economic policy is a turning point in the crisis. The new economic policy is a social revolution and the beginning of the Three People's Principles. We must concentrate the scattered forces to complete it. Shanghai used to be a paradise for adventurers, but it has begun to change. We want it to continue to change. It must be changed. Speculative markets and unscrupulous merchants hoarding are not allowed to exist in Shanghai. The Three People's Principles guarantee private property and private enterprises. It has been so in the past, it is so today, and it will be so in the future, but unscrupulous merchants who hoard, speculate, and exploit the masses must be eliminated. Unscrupulous merchants have colluded with corrupt officials. Yes, Qi Zaiyu is an example. In the future, whoever is corrupt will be shot. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. We must first overcome the reactionary economic forces in Shanghai to stabilize the country's economy.

Fight to the End with Evil Forces

The new economic policy in Shanghai has been supported and believed in by 5 million citizens. In the past three weeks, in the first week, unscrupulous merchants tried to undermine the price limit. In the second week, black markets for gold, US dollars, and cotton cloth appeared. I arrested a few unscrupulous merchants and confiscated a lot of hoarded goods. In the third week, it calmed down. This proves that the rise in prices is not entirely due to economic reasons and can be overcome by political forces. Now that the main force of reactionary economics has not been eliminated, the economic future of Shanghai is the eve of a storm, but we are not afraid and do not shake, and are determined to fight to the end with evil forces.

What is People's Livelihood?

After I locked up a few big capitalists, some people thought that I was not democratic. What is democracy? It is democracy to use the power of the majority to suppress the minority. Democracy is speaking for the majority, not for the enjoyment of the minority. After Rong Hongyuan was arrested, the capitalists' lackeys spread rumors, saying that 50,000 people relied on him for food and that they would all lose their jobs in the future. What a joke! He is the one who makes money from 50,000 people. After the government confiscated a lot of hoarded goods, some people said that the government was a robber. Among the goods we confiscated, some had been hoarded for more than three years. These goods were no longer commodities, but tools for them to disrupt the market and weapons to exploit the people. They made millions of US dollars in a turn, robbing the money of the majority. This is a robber. Some people also said that if I continue like this, the factories will close. The government has the power of the people. Why can't it take over?

Hard Work, Hard Work, Practical Work

Finally, Jiang offered three points to the members of the Youth Army Friendship Association: (1) Work hard, don't work casually, (2) Work hard, don't work blindly, (3) Work practically, don't work nonsense. He also pointed out that the saying "No merchant is not a traitor" cannot be established if most good merchants are killed. He also corrected the two phrases "Fight the Tiger" and "Justice Jiang", because the former is individual heroism, and now it is concentrating the power of the majority to fight against evil forces, and the latter is the remnant of feudal ideology. Officials are public servants of the people, and it is their duty to eliminate harm for the people. He also said: We are not trying to be happy now, but doing it in a planned way. We want to turn the paradise of adventurers into the paradise of the people of Shanghai.

The main points were: (1) Absorb as much foreign capital and production tools as possible to assist China's industrial construction. (2) Private industrial groups can have more contact with foreign industrial circles. (3) In addition to the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada is an emerging industrial country and can be a new friend of China's industrial circles. (4) China's economic construction should pay equal attention to industry and agriculture, and should pay attention to the interests of the majority of the people. After Chen finished his speech, he also answered many questions raised by the members of the association. The tea party did not disperse until about 6:00 pm.
