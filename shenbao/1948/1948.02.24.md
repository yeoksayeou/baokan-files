### Brewing Major Battle in Western Shenyang; Many Northeastern Bandits Gather in Xinmin; Powerful National Army from Inside the Pass Deployed to Reinforce Defense

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 23rd] A major battle is brewing in Xinmin, west of Shenyang. Battles are currently taking place on the east, south, and north sides of Juliu River, northeast of Xinmin. Since the 21st, bandits have been gathering in this area. National Army forces are very strong in the Liuhugou area, south of Xinmin. The bandits seem to be attempting to open up three battlefields, with the main battlefield in Xinmin, the northern battlefield possibly between Kaiyuan and Tieling, where many bandits who fled from Tongjiangkou have gathered near Kaiyuan. These bandits near Kaiyuan are from the 10th Column and Han Communist Li Hongguang's detachment. The southern battlefield seems to be Yingkou, with bandits fleeing from Anshan to the Niuzhuang area. The National Army is preparing to counterattack. In the northwest area of Shenyang, bandits are harassing the area of Wanjintai and Laobian, about 30 kilometers away, but their numbers are small and their role is to create a diversion.

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 23rd] It is rumored that the bandits who have fled to the Xinmin area are from the 1st, 7th, and 8th Columns, and they seem to be planning to first seize and destroy the Juliu River Railway Bridge with their main force, and then attack Xinmin. There has already been contact in the area near the Juliu River Bridge.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 23rd] (1) After the Communist bandits in western Liaoning occupied Dahushan, they are actively repairing the railway from Tongliao to Jin Shen (Jinxi-Shenyang), and are currently continuing to build from Xinlitun to Dahushan. However, this section has not yet been completed due to air raids. (2) A certain National Army unit from inside the Pass will reinforce the Jin Yu (Jinxi-Yingkou) section outside the Pass, and Fan's army group outside the Pass will be able to actively advance eastward.

[Another Dispatch] Sources say: The equipment at the Anshan Iron Mine has not suffered major damage, but the station has been completely destroyed. On the 23rd, the air force dispatched planes to bomb the area.

[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] National Army sources admitted on the 23rd to another serious setback: Faku, 40 miles north of Shenyang, has been abandoned, allowing the Communist army to intensify its blockade of Shenyang and to attack from the north. Faku is a key point on the highway and protects the west side of Tieling and Kaiyuan. The Communist army is now attacking these two places. In the Anshan area, the Communist army is heading towards Yingkou with a large force of about nine divisions, and is expected to attack Fushun and Yingkou simultaneously. However, National Army troops and supplies are still arriving in Yingkou.

### Soviet Radio Station Publicly Claims Communist Bandits Plan to Occupy Shenyang; US Embassy Denies Withdrawal of Staff and Dependents from Shenyang Consulate

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] A US Embassy spokesman said on the 23rd that he was unaware of reports from Shanghai that the State Department had ordered the families of US consulate personnel in Shenyang to "leave immediately."

[United Press, Qingdao, 22nd] The Chinese Air Force suddenly stopped flying to Shenyang today, and the situation there is becoming more urgent. At the same time, the US State Department has advised the dependents of US consulate staff there to withdraw immediately. Mrs. Ward, the Consul General, is expected to arrive in Tianjin tomorrow. Mr. Dalsden, a Seventh-day Adventist missionary, arrived here from Shenyang on the 20th and said that the situation in Shenyang was "intolerable". The Communist army is generally attacking the Hun River Airport, one and a half miles southwest of Shenyang. Listening to Soviet radio broadcasts in Shenyang, it is openly stated that the Communist army is now planning to occupy Shenyang because it needs the China Changchun Railway. The news of the Chinese Air Force canceling flights to Shenyang was released by Roselot, the representative of Chennault's Air Transport Group stationed in Shenyang. However, according to Mr. Bridge, the Shandong District Manager of the Air Transport Group, the team plans to send planes to Shenyang six times to evacuate foreigners, while consulate staff will remain in place. It is feared that the Hun River Airport has fallen or is about to fall. Air Transport Group planes are landing at the Dongda Airport, about ten miles from the city. Twenty-one British missionaries and six employees of the British American Tobacco Company are expected to fly out of Shenyang tomorrow. Dalsden also said that residents of Shenyang are lacking food, and many families are committing suicide. Babies who are only a month old are mostly fed corn. Coal is not for sale, and prices are so high that they are almost beyond purchasing power. A bag of flour weighing eight pounds sells for about US$15. Two or three police officers are stationed at every street corner, and when food occasionally enters the city, it is escorted by heavy troops. There is no way to leave except by air. Soldiers are not allowed to ride in mule carts.

### Taft, Martin, and Judd Vociferously Advocate Military Aid to China; Future Peace in the Far East More Important than in Europe

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Influential Republican members of Congress vigorously advocated on the 23rd that there should be more military assistance to China. Senator Taft of Ohio and Speaker of the House Martin severely criticized the government authorities for failing to include strong anti-communist military assistance in their $570 million aid-to-China plan. In a speech he prepared to deliver at Detriot, Taft stated: "The reality of reviving China and the value of such relief is an open question, but we must give the Chinese government weapons and ammunition sufficient to resist the communist forces in the Northeast, just as we are resisting communist forces in Greece." Taft pointed out that the "crux of the situation" was Marshall's "dislike of the Chinese and disinterest in the Chinese issue." He also said: "Unless immediate and active action is taken, the entire Northeast will fall to communism. If the Northeast is controlled by communism, we can well expect that Japan will not be immune to its infiltration in the future."

Martin agreed with Taft's opinion, believing that the government's request for an anti-communist aid-to-Europe plan, while simultaneously opposing effective aid to China, was contradictory. He said: Regardless of Marshall's statement last week that China cannot effectively use the assistance that has already been given, he still insists that military assistance must be given to China. He expects that Congress will at least approve part of the government's requested $570 million aid-to-China plan, but he further expects that members of Congress will demand that weapons and military supplies be given to the Chiang Kai-shek government.

Taft said that the policy toward China "will undermine everything the Marshall Plan has attempted to establish in Europe in the Far East." He said: "It was largely due to Vandenberg that the government authorities were finally forced to abandon the policy of appeasement toward the Soviet Union. He deeply believed that pursuing such a policy would accomplish nothing, and strongly influenced former Secretary of State Byrnes until we finally determined to absolutely oppose the continued expansion of the Soviet Union."

He pointed out that the current policy toward China "completely violates the traditional policy of the Republican Party." I firmly believe that in the end, the future peace in the Far East must be more important than in Europe, and we should give the same concern to the progress of communism on the other side of the Pacific as we do in Europe.

[United Press, Atlantic City, 22nd] Republican Congressman Judd declared on the night of the 22nd that even if the Marshall Plan succeeds, it will still be divided into two major camps: on one side will be the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and on the other side will be the United States and the sixteen countries of Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and a small number of other countries. If the United States wants to win the political war against the Soviet Union, it is essential to give financial and military aid to China. If China falls, the Soviet Union will rely on its fifth column to control the largest part of the manpower on the planet, and the United States only needs to spend less than 1.5 billion yuan to restore peace and economic security to China.

[Associated Press, New York, 22nd] Former President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, Kong Xiangxi, told the Associated Press on the 22nd that China greatly welcomes the $570 million aid plan that may be obtained in the US Congress, but military aid is even more important.

[Associated Press, New York, 22nd] Wallace, the Third Party presidential candidate in the United States, issued a written statement on the 22nd stating that President Truman's aid-to-China plan is "provocative of war." He demanded a complete withdrawal of American "financial and military intervention" in China. He said: If we provide financial assistance to the "Chinese government, it is another stage in our financial and military intervention in China." Wallace declared: The government's aid-to-China plan "is a clear indication of the inevitable failure of our current foreign policy, and the Marshall Plan is only a part of that policy." Wallace's statement was directed against Truman's "plea that $570 million represents purely civil and economic assistance." He cited so-called "examples of military intervention, including 1,000 US military officers assisting in the training of 10 divisional new recruits, the "secret" construction of bases in Qingdao and Taiwan, the "frequent" patrolling of the Chinese sea by the US Navy, and the transfer of 271 naval ships and aircraft to the Chinese government." (Editor's note: Wallace is currently campaigning.)

### Ambassador Stuart on Foreign Aid: Should Rely on Self-Management

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 23rd] Ambassador Stuart met with reporters again at 3:00 PM on the 23rd, reiterating his consistent support for Chairman Chiang and the National Government. Ambassador Stuart believes that the Chinese government and people should find a common ideal, then all external aid can be effectively applied, but external aid is generally economic, at most military, while politics must rely on self-help. Even if external aid can come from a sustainable source, it must be managed by oneself. The conditions for managing it are divided into two aspects: government and people. On the government side, it should help the people to exercise their civil rights, and at the same time try to allow the people to enjoy the rights of the four freedoms. On the people's side, they should find ways to contribute their own strength to assist the government in completing democratic politics. Ambassador Stuart further stated that he had contacted many Chinese people, such as professors, students, reporters, etc., and they all showed a negative or attacking, or even opposing, attitude toward the government. In fact, they should supervise the government and make constructive criticisms at any time to help the government complete democratic politics.

### Story of Mediation in Civil War Denied by Soviet Embassy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Regarding the report by the Associated Press of the United States that a certain official from the Soviet Union stationed in China had informally expressed to our government his intention to mediate the civil war, a spokesman for the Soviet Embassy here told reporters on the morning of the 23rd: "This news has no basis."

### Zheng Dongguo Concurrently Appointed Commander of the First Army Group; Flew to Nanjing from Beiping Yesterday to Request Instructions; Fan Hanjie Scheduled to Go South Today to Discuss Policy for Governance of Jehol

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 23rd] Zheng Dongguo was ordered to concurrently serve as commander of the First Army Group. After receiving the order, Zheng came to Beiping from Shenyang yesterday, and transferred to the capital by military aircraft this afternoon to request instructions from the central government. The original commander of the First Army Group was Fan Hanjie. After Fan was ordered to govern Jehol, he was no longer able to take care of the military affairs of the Beining Railway, so Zheng was appointed as his concurrent replacement. Zheng told reporters that Shenyang had been trending towards stability in recent days. The bandits have five columns near Shenyang and three columns near Anshan. At present, the Northeast relies only on air supply. If a land route can be opened up, the overall situation can be reversed. Zheng emphasized that the Northeast currently needs to win battles, and to win battles, weapons, ammunition, and food are indispensable. He did not deny that two divisions of the National Army had already come from Shanghai to support the north. When reporters asked about the current military value of Changchun, Jilin, and Siping, and what contributions Northeast veterans Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Ma Zhanshan might make to the current situation in the Northeast, he did not answer, but praised that the ice and snow in Shenyang were gradually melting, and there was already a hint of spring.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 23rd] The newly appointed Chairman of Jehol Province, Fan Hanjie, is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 24th to request instructions from the central government on the policy of governing Jehol. It is reported that Fan will devote himself to developing the military and political affairs of Jehol, so as to eliminate the threat from the north side of the Beining Railway and block the connection between the communist bandits in the Northeast and North China. After receiving the order, Fan came to Beiping from Qinhuangdao, and met with Li Zongren and Fu Zuoyi frequently. It is heard that a plan for developing the military and political affairs of Jehol has already been drafted. Fan will take this plan to request instructions from the central government. According to a source familiar with the matter, the military affairs of Jehol will be closely coordinated with the Northeast (especially Jinzhou) in the future, the political affairs will learn from Chahar and Suiyuan in organizing and training the people's armed forces, and the economy will strengthen ties with Beiping and Tianjin.

### Shandong Industrial and Commercial Loans Need More Than 900 Billion

Reports from Representatives of Various Trade Associations

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 23rd] At the economic symposium hosted by the Jinan branch of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, representatives of various trade associations in Jinan reported on the actual situation of industry and commerce in Jinan, saying that Jinan has a population of about 700,000, needing 800,000 catties of grain per day. The current grain reserves are extremely low, and the surrounding areas are occupied by communist bandits. Less than 200,000 catties of grain are entering the city every day. When the new wheat arrives on the market, Jinan will lack 70 million catties of grain, and it is necessary to find a way to import grain from abroad to alleviate the famine. Furthermore, in order to save the industry and commerce of Shandong, the loans needed are: the textile industry and the flour industry each need to borrow 120 billion, the dyeing and weaving industry needs 90 billion, the oil pressing industry needs 20 billion, the match industry needs 60 billion, and together with other general industries and businesses, more than 900 billion in loans are needed. The industrial and commercial circles of Jinan unanimously requested Liu Zhendong, a member of the National Economic Commission who came to Shandong to inspect the actual situation of the Jinan economy, to appeal on their behalf when he returns to Nanjing on the 23rd and submit a report.

### Special Review Committee of the Four Joint Offices Decides on Principles for Agricultural Loans; Bank Deposit Interest Rates to be Raised

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Special Review Committee of the Four Joint Offices held a subcommittee meeting at 3 PM on the 23rd to review the agricultural loan plan and cooperative loan plan submitted by the Four Joint Council on the 21st. Xu Kan presided over the meeting, which was attended by Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Guofu, Chen Qitian, Xu Baiyuan, Xue Dubi, Li Shuming, and Shou Miancheng. Responsible individuals from the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury were also present. The agricultural loan plan under review was divided into three parts: (1) the Farmers Bank's proposed emergency agricultural loan plan for the first half of the 37th year (already seen in this newspaper on the 23rd), (2) the Farmers Bank's proposed "Measures for Trial Implementation of Agricultural Loans in the 37th Year: Cash Loans with Real Goods Collection, and Cash Loans for Real Goods Purchase" (published in the first column of the second page), and (3) the Central Cooperative Treasury's loan plan for the 37th year (published in the first column of the second page). During the discussion, the principles decided by the Four Joint Council on the 21st were first consulted, and then the measures proposed by the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury were discussed item by item. Because some techniques still needed further study, it was decided to hold review meetings again on the 26th and 28th to make a final decision, submit it to the Si Lian Council next Thursday for approval, and then report it to the Chairman for approval before implementation. In the review meeting on the 23rd, it was generally agreed that the main targets of agricultural loans should be food, cotton, and export materials, and that loans should be issued in kind as much as possible. The principle of "cash loans with real goods collection" proposed by the Farmers Bank was advocated to be deleted in the meeting. Cash loans can only be used for specific loans. If cash loans are given completely, it will be contrary to the principle of curbing inflation. In the past, it was hoped that agricultural loan funds would be raised by various banks and bureaus themselves, but this has proven difficult. Zhang Jia'ao has agreed to have the Central Bank supply them, but hopes that the amount will not be too large. In addition, various banks and bureaus will increase interest rates to attract deposits. The meeting also discussed the issue of overlapping loan businesses between the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury, and decided that the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury will hold a joint review meeting on the 26th to discuss the division of business. Three principles have been decided on the 23rd: (1) If both parties need to handle the business, the two parties will handle it together, but the regions should be divided, such as cotton, which will be jointly handled by both parties. (2) In areas where the cooperative foundation is solid or the foundation is generally sound, the loan business will be handled by the Cooperative Treasury. (3) Loans suitable for cooperative methods will be handled by the Cooperative Treasury. The total amount of agricultural loans was not determined at the meeting on the 23rd. The Farmers Bank of China originally planned to provide more than 550 billion yuan in emergency loans for the first half of this year, but on the 23rd it proposed that the loans for the second half of the year also be allocated for use in the first half. The original plan of 883 billion for land and financial loans in the agricultural loan section will not be changed. For the Cooperative Treasury, it is planned to increase wheat loans by 400 billion yuan and food loans by 100 billion yuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The competent authorities have decided to revise the deposit interest rates of various banks and bureaus, which will be increased according to the market interest rate standards, and may be formulated by themselves with reference to the different interest rates in various regions, in order to attract deposits. However, the interest rate is still slightly lower than the market rate. This method can be approved for implementation.

Editorial

### The Future of the Ashida Cabinet

After the Japanese Katayama Cabinet submitted its resignation this month, the four parties have been consulting and negotiating for ten days on the nomination of the next prime minister. Jiyuto's Yoshida and Minshuto's Ashida were both popular and refused to give way to each other, so they resorted to a nomination vote in the Diet on the 21st. The election results in the House of Representatives: Ashida won 216 votes, Yoshida won 180 votes, and Katayama won 8 votes. Ashida was nominated as Prime Minister. In the second election in the House of Councillors, Yoshida won 104 votes and Ashida won 102 votes, both of which did not reach the majority of 218 votes. According to Article 67 of the Japanese Constitution, the resolution of the House of Representatives is the resolution of the parliament, so although Ashida did not win an overwhelming majority of votes, it has actually been decided that he will be the next Prime Minister, which is an inevitable trend. Now, Ashida has established a cabinet formation headquarters in Yuezhong and is about to convene the Jiyu, Social, and Cooperative parties to hold a policy agreement meeting. Like Katayama's New Cabinet last year, Ashida hopes to form a four-party coalition cabinet and take the four-party policy agreement as the new cabinet's policy guidelines. However, according to reports from Tokyo in the past two days, it is difficult for the Jiyu party to cooperate with Ashida, and even Saito Takao, the honorary president of the Democratic Party, has expressed his refusal to allow the left wing of the Socialist Party to join the cabinet. Stubborn conservative newspapers have unanimously criticized Ashida for cooperating with the left wing. Ashida is on the verge of a cliff, with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow. He is struggling on a difficult road. The selection of new cabinet personnel these days is probably more important than policy consultation. It is difficult to predict whether the cabinet will be successfully formed smoothly this week or encounter any risks.

Hitoshi Ashida is a lucky man in Japanese politics today. With the Minshuto party's weak mass base and minority party status in the third place in the parliament, he was able to leap to the dragon gate in today's chaotic political situation, overwhelming Yoshida with one hand and holding the left wing with the other. Undoubtedly, he is more successful than the simple Katayama, and he is more popular than the sophisticated Yoshida. In fact, Ashida's success this time is entirely due to his ability to use the environment well. He was able to unite these contradictions in a speculative way between the confrontation between the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party and the contradictions between the left and right wings of the Socialist Party. He succeeded himself and also improved the status of the Democratic Party. First, due to the division of the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, the Socialist Party Congress on January 16 passed a bill to abolish the four-party agreement, which caused the Katayama Cabinet to lose its basis for existence. In addition, Katayama Tetsuya's attitude was strong and he took the middle road without leaning to the left, so the left wing of the Socialist Party used the budget committee of the House of Representatives to cut the funds of the Ministry of Finance. The Katayama Cabinet was already facing a currency crisis. It was impossible to stop it, and this attack by the House of Representatives brought down the Katayama Cabinet. Ashida was an important pillar of the Katayama Cabinet. As Foreign Minister, he had the status of Deputy Prime Minister. He supported Katayama, cooperated with the right wing of the Socialist Party, Nishio, and sympathized with the Socialist Party's left wing in the opposition, Kato and Suzuki. He was resourceful and well-connected. In this nomination for Prime Minister, the Socialist Party and the Cooperative Party supported him, and the Socialist Party and the Cooperative Party supported him in the Diet vote, so he was able to overwhelm the Liberal Party and other conservative parties with the majority of the Democratic, Social, and Cooperative parties. This is Ashida's luck, this is Ashida's wit. Second, Katayama took office in June last year and formally stepped down from the position of Prime Minister after only nine months. During these nine months, the Katayama Cabinet was constantly attacked by the Liberal Party and threatened by the conservative New Party Movement. The reason why the Katayama Cabinet was shaking but not falling was not because Katayama was determined to do things, nor was it because the socialist policy was successful. Most of it was due to Ashida's cooperation and support. He was able to use his wit to deal with the anti-government factions, and he was able to stand up when Katayama was hesitant and provide strong assistance to the Katayama Cabinet, so he was able to benefit from the Fisheries problem; so he was able to inherit after Katayama resigned, so he was able to speculate in the two major contradictions between society and freedom. Since Ashida's success is so wonderful, he is by no means an accidental person or an ordinary person. If he succeeds in forming a cabinet, his subsequent policies and actions will be even more worthy of attention.

Hitoshi Ashida was born in Kyoto and is 61 years old this year. After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, he entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and worked in Europe for about 20 years. He obtained a doctorate in law with his thesis "Research on the Tatar Strait." Later, because he was determined to become a politician, he resigned as a diplomat and joined the Seiyukai in his hometown as a candidate for councillor. Until last year, he was elected as a councillor six times. He is famous in the Japanese literary world as the president of "The Japan Times" and the chief writer of "Hochi Shimbun," and is also a diplomatic commentator. He has written many works. When the Seiyukai had internal conflicts, he supported Hatoyama; when the Liberal Party was established, he was the left wing of the party and did not cooperate much with Shigeru Yoshida. When the Progressive Party was transformed into the Democratic Party, Inukai Ken, Narahashi Wataru, and Ishiguro Jūzo were about to be purged. He managed to become the first president of the Democratic Party, and placed the right-wing commander Kijuro Shidehara in the position of honorary president. Last year, Shidehara was attacked and removed from office, and Saito Takao was appointed as the honorary president. Ashida's bloodless revolution monopolized the power of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is not a progressive political party, and it owns a small number of financial groups and landlords with feudal atmosphere, but he vigorously defended the corrected constitutionalism and pretended to be progressive liberalism; Ashida once swore allegiance to the army during the war. During the Japanese invasion of China, he presided over the Hochi Shimbun and promoted the "Conquest of China" theory. He was known as a "critic who kills with a single word." His political enemies were preparing to propose a purge after the war. He was able to use his nimble methods to prevent the purge from happening. Before the Japanese peace treaty was signed, he actually made wild remarks in his position as Foreign Minister, demanding the return of Ryukyu Chidori, which caused an uproar in the political world. As a result, Katayama rescued him and the Allied Forces indulged him. From the perspective of Ashida's experience, environment, and actions, he is completely a politician with plans, talents, and the ability to be opportunistic and flexible. He does not have Katayama's simplicity and purity. Today, he is full of ambition and is taking the stage in full costume, which will inevitably take Japanese politics a step back and be reactionary. His political foundation is an old-fashioned Japan. It can be asserted that he may brazenly revive Japanese militarism.

We are unwilling to make too many speculations about the personnel arrangements and policies of the Oita Cabinet. What needs to be pointed out here is that the Ashida Cabinet is the inheritance of the Katayama Cabinet, and its foundation is still fragile; however, what is different from Katayama is that he can tolerate the left and right wings of the Socialist Party for his own use, thereby using the left wing of the Socialist Party as his political foundation. The left wing of the Socialist Party has ideals and ambitions, as well as political desires. They may become the tail of Ashida, embellishing the unprogressive and conservative cabinet. However, Ashida's "black market transactions" with the left wing cannot be maintained for long. Due to the oppression of the conservative forces of the Liberal Party and the opposition within the Democratic Party, Ashida may sacrifice the left wing in order to preserve his own vested political interests. These possibilities and inevitable facts illustrate the conservatism and reaction of the Ashida Cabinet.

Finally, it must be pointed out that Shigeru Yoshida's conservative forces are increasingly rising in the political arena, which can be explained by the large number of Liberal Party satellites and the fact that the House of Representatives nomination vote was only 36 votes apart. The Ashida Cabinet is the inheritance of the Katayama Cabinet, but she is the extension of the Shidehara Yoshida Cabinet. Therefore, the conclusion of our observation of the Japanese political situation is that Japanese politics has taken a step back from today. If Ashida falls, Yoshida will inevitably inherit the future situation. Japanese politics is taking steps back, becoming increasingly conservative, and finally returning to its former appearance, which is becoming increasingly distant from the democratization and progress of Japanese politics that we desire. We view Ashida's taking the stage in full costume in this way, and we do not have deep importance and expectations for its development.

### Cash Loans and Real Goods Collection and Purchase: The Farmers Bank Formulates Measures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] In order to cooperate with the national lending policy, the Central Cooperative Treasury has formulated a loan plan for this year, and plans to conduct cooperative ordering loans for various major necessities of people's livelihood and export materials in areas where branches have been established and the cooperative organization has a more solid foundation.

### Victory in the War of Resistance and the Restoration of Taiwan Should Be Attributed to the Three Principles of the People: Vice Chairman Sun's Address to All Circles in Tainan

[Central News Agency Tainan 22nd] Vice Chairman Sun Ke addressed all circles in Tainan at the City Government Auditorium at 2:00 pm today, saying: Taiwan was ceded to Japan and was not restored until the victory of the War of Resistance and the surrender of Japan. This is actually due to the enemy resistance and sacrifices of tens of millions of compatriots in the country and patriotic people in Taiwan. For fifty years, the compatriots in the country have never forgotten Taiwan for a day. We should attribute our victory and restoration of Taiwan to the Three Principles of the People, that is, the most suitable doctrine for saving the country. Among them, nationalism advocates that the country belongs to the entire nation and must not allow foreign oppression. National sovereignty belongs to all people. The principle of democracy is to implement national politics. People should have rights, interests, and obligations, and cannot be monopolized by a few ambitious people. The principle of people's livelihood is to implement civil affairs so that everyone can live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, the Three Principles of the People generate power. The Founding Father used it to call on the whole country and overthrow the Manchus. Later, Chairman Chiang led the Northern Expedition to unify the country, and the July 7th War of Resistance defeated Japan. All of this was inspired by the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, and we have a wise leader, Chairman Chiang, who leads the country, and we will be able to defeat Japanese imperialism. Japan is an island country, and the country is short-sighted and lacks political leaders with a long-term vision, so it has embarked on the road to failure. After the peace treaty is signed in the future, it will never be allowed to have any military legacy, so that the reading martial arts doctrine of the past will not rise again. Looking back at our country, we have a bright future. In the future, all compatriots in the country must be confident that all difficulties can be overcome, and the communist bandits' rebellion can be quelled within two or three years. As for the peace treaty issue with Japan, any peace treaty that has not been agreed to by China can absolutely not be established. In the future, striving for true peace is even more difficult than winning the war, but we firmly believe that this difficulty can be overcome, and the status of the Republic of China in the world will definitely be improved. Finally, I hope that all compatriots in the country will consistently believe in the Three Principles of the People, trust the government, support the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, work together with one heart and one mind, and jointly build the country and revitalize the Chinese nation.

### Our Immigration to the United States: Two Key Items Agreed Upon by Both Sides

[Central News Agency Nanjing 23rd] Regarding immigration matters to the United States, there are different views between China and the United States. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has repeatedly asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the US government. It is now learned that the key points recently agreed upon are as follows: (1) The US government believes that immigration to the United States by people from all countries is an internal affair of the United States and has the right to review it. The immigration passport issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be included in the immigration quota only after it has been signed by the US. (2) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously notified the US Embassy in China that any passports issued by the Ministry with the word "Emigrant" noted should be included in the immigration quota calculation. Those who hold other general passports to the United States will not be counted within the quota immigration, and the US Embassy has agreed. As for the Chinese wives and children of American Chinese soldiers brought back to the United States from China, if they have not been issued immigration passports by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they should not be regarded as quota immigrants. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent another letter to the US Embassy.

### We Again Request the Philippine Authorities to Allow Overseas Chinese Stall Vendors to Resume Business: Minister Chen Zhiping Submitted a Note Yesterday

[Central News Agency Manila 23rd] Our Minister to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, submitted another note to Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino today, again requesting that the overseas Chinese stall vendors who were expelled from the Manila Public Market on January 25 be allowed to resume business. It is believed that the note pointed out that before the ruling of the Supreme Court of the Philippines was handed down, the overseas Chinese stall vendors in the market had been forcibly expelled. The ruling of the Supreme Court proved that the Manila local court was indeed determined to oppose Chinese nationals, and this behavior was sufficient to prove that there is currently an anti-Chinese trend in the Philippines. The note explained that before January 25, there were 351 vacant stalls, and the Philippine authorities expelled the overseas Chinese stall vendors before filling the vacancies. This point is not in line with the main goal of the Philippine Public Market Act, which gives Filipinos "priority" rights. The note further explained that among the seven major markets in Manila, there are 9,449 stalls, of which only 453 are occupied by overseas Chinese, accounting for 5%, and there are currently 507 stalls that are not being operated by anyone. Minister Chen will meet with President Roxas tomorrow morning to discuss the market stall incident and other outstanding issues related to Sino-Philippine relations. Chen was originally scheduled to meet with Roxas today, but it was delayed by one day due to certain reasons.

### Northeastern Elders' Appeal - Continued from Page 1

People from the Northeast in Beiping and Tianjin Provide Six Points of Opinion

(1) For the past two years, the Northeast has been undergoing massive destruction every day. The countryside is bankrupt, and industry and mining are destroyed. There is no national economy or people's livelihood to speak of. In terms of administration, the agencies are huge and powerful, and the military and civilians are at odds. Social order is trending towards chaos, and the area under its jurisdiction is shrinking day by day. The entire Northeastern people are trapped in a terrible situation from which they are powerless to extricate themselves. We must loudly appeal to the government to thoroughly reform.

(2) The most urgent problem to be solved is the lack of food. More than one-fifth of the 2 million people in Shenyang are filling their stomachs with soybean cakes and soybean residue every day. In addition, refugees from the surrounding countryside are continuously fleeing into the city. If transportation is not smooth, the entire city's people will be without food. In the current situation, only scattered lines remain, and the amount of currency in circulation is already in the trillions. The price of counterfeit money during the enemy's occupation was equal to that of the Taiwan currency. After the recovery, the exchange rate between the Taiwan currency and the legal tender went from a ratio of one to thirty to a ratio of one to over one hundred. However, the Northeast has always maintained a ratio of one to ten and prohibits the export of legal tender. There is only an exchange rate, not a ratio. Relatively speaking, the difference is tenfold. We must ask the central government to remedy this and take emergency measures.

(3) The current military situation in the Northeast has reached a critical stage. The current focus is on how to take effective aid to support it. Existing strongholds must be maintained, and efforts must be made to increase strength and effective disposition.

(4) The Northeast problem is not just a matter of local interests and losses. It is a problem for the entire country. If the Northeast is abandoned, the forces against the government will increase dramatically. Hundreds of thousands or even millions of troops will immediately attack Rehe and Chahar. The existing forces in North China will definitely not be able to resist. If North China is not secured, the enemy will gather the manpower and resources of the Northeast and North China, drive south, and the area south of the Yangtze River will also be indefensible. Today, consolidating North China means protecting the South. Striving for the Northeast also means maintaining North China. We must appeal to the people of the whole country to face the reality of the Northeast and have a common understanding. If the entire situation in China is controlled by power and violence, Annam, Burma, India, and various parts of Nanyang will also be affected in the same way, and the peace of the entire world will be threatened. Therefore, the Northeast problem is also a problem for the world.

(5) In order to support the Northeast and maintain the existing situation, we should give priority to opening up the traffic route between Jinzhou and Shenyang. It is also necessary to immediately concentrate and enhance the military force in North China in order to be able to respond effectively at close range.

(6) If the manpower and material resources of the Northeast are used well, it can become a great force for stabilizing China. Unfortunately, it is forced to be used by others and turned into a group of violence. This is the most distressing thing. The youth of the Northeast have experienced many changes and are mostly patriotic. The desire to defend their homeland is the strongest. If the central government can have appropriate measures, I believe it can take on the responsibility of defending the country. We believe that the timing is critical and the situation is serious. Appealing for the Northeast is also appealing for the entire country. We also hope to promote the righteous assistance of peace-loving people around the world.

Zhang added a personal supplement, saying: Today's Northeast problem is no longer a question of abandoning or not abandoning it. If the government has a solution, the gains and losses of the war are not worth mentioning. Today's problem is actually a question of whether it can be let go or not. Once you let go, others will take it away. If the Northeast is lost, North China will definitely not be secured within one to three months. This is how everyone in the Northeast and North China views it, including the military officials in charge. We are here to hope that everyone will have a deep understanding of the importance of the Northeast. This is also the common hope of the people of the Northeast.

The Current Northeast Problem Affects the Entire World

Wang Depu, the executive director of the Nanjing Northeastern Fellow Townsmen Association, then delivered a speech. He said in brief: The Northeast problem may be viewed differently by people in the Northeast, people in North China, and people along the Nanjing-Shanghai line. However, after talking with Ma and others and fellow townsmen's associations in various places last night, the opinions on the Northeast have become consistent. The whole country and even the whole world have the same understanding of the importance of the Northeast, and the urgent plan for the Northeast is how to defend the Northeast and maintain the existing broken points and lines. If sacrificing the Northeast can benefit the whole country and the world, then we are willing to sacrifice the Northeast. However, the gains and losses of the Northeast are now the key to the peace and tranquility of our country and the entire world. Therefore, we must do our best to defend the Northeast. Han Junjie, the chairman of Heilongjiang Province, then reported on the recent situation in the Northeast, saying: The crisis in the Northeast has reached its final moment today. Many people see that the Northeast is not secure. I have always been optimistic and not so pessimistic about the Northeast problem. However, if there are no effective measures to take, then of course I am pessimistic. In recent years, the measures in the Northeast have been chaotic. The first mistake was in believing in diplomacy, the second mistake was in economic measures, and the third mistake was in peace talks. In addition to these major mistakes, there were many small mistakes in administration and personnel, which led to the current mess in the Northeast. Everyone is responsible for this. There is no need to go into detail now. In the future, we must strive to win back the lost Northeast. If there are any more mistakes, it will definitely be lost. As for the economic problem, the number of circulation coupons issued is alarming, and the area of circulation is only a few incomplete counties and villages. How can prices not rise? The Northeast needs materials, but transportation is difficult, and transportation costs are a problem, resulting in a shortage of food and daily necessities, which increases the burden on the people and affects the military. Therefore, if we want the military to develop, the economic problem must be solved first. As for the military problem, Han said that when Chief Commander Chen raised the issue, Han suggested that the focus of bandit suppression must be placed in the Northeast. The Northeast is the screen of China. If the banditry in the Northeast is suppressed, the banditry within the pass will also be resolved. A Northeastern proverb says, "Close the door and beat the blind man." How can he not be eliminated? Finally, Han hoped that the Beijing and Shanghai press would mobilize public opinion and attract international attention. If the Northeast is not secure, the whole world will change because of it. The United States thinks that Europe comes first, but this view is too simple. The Soviet Union attaches importance to Asia because Europe has restrictions, while Asia has unlimited manpower and material resources. Once Asia falls into the hands of the Soviet Union, the whole world will be threatened. The current government must make a decision. Civil servants in the Northeast must not retreat and must fight forward with all their strength to defend the Northeast. At present, the manpower and material resources of the Northeast are still not a problem and can be fought for. Therefore, the military needs to be planned in a unified manner, and a sufficient military force must be used to eliminate the communist bandits in one fell swoop. Last spring, only one more army was needed, and last summer, only two more armies were needed to adequately eliminate the communist bandits. Therefore, we cannot deal with the communist bandits on a small scale. If we operate on a small scale, we will only be consumed by the communist bandits little by little. As for the administrative and economic measures in the interior, they cannot be promoted in the same way in the Northeast at present. The Northeast must simplify administration and concentrate its forces on bandit suppression and military affairs.

Zhang Yuanfu and Han Junjie Answer Reporters' Questions

Shi Bingyan, the director of the Shanghai Northeastern Fellow Townsmen Association, said. There are only a few simple words: I hope the military and the people will not be separated.

The reporters then raised several questions and asked Zhang Yuanfu and Han Junjie to answer them. Regarding the specific food panic and the lack of military strength, Zhang replied: If transportation is resolved, there will be no problem with food, and military strength depends on bullets and manpower. It is not a problem to train 50,000 to 100,000 men in North China. The shortage is bullets. Therefore, under the circumstances of limited strength, we must concentrate our efforts on effective places. Han also provided facts to answer the food panic problem, saying: As far as he knows, Huludao currently has food transported from various places, which is enough for the citizens of Shenyang and nearby troops for three months. However, due to transportation problems, it cannot be transported there. Therefore, if the military situation is slightly opened up and the transportation line can be maintained, there will be no problem with food. Zhang also answered a reporter's question about Zhang Xueliang's return to politics, saying: The people of the Northeast have not considered this point. The people of the Northeast obey the government's orders. No matter what measures the government takes, the people of the Northeast are willing to obey.

Finally, Zhang Yuanfu summarized three points: (1) I hope everyone will publicize more and call on the people of the whole country to pay attention to the Northeast. (2) The strength of North China must be enhanced. North China can have trained manpower to supplement the Northeast. This is the most effective method. (3) If the Northeast is abandoned, an organization will inevitably appear. What kind of organization this is and its impact on world peace can also be imagined by everyone.

### London Conference Opened Yesterday; Three Countries Discuss Various Issues Concerning West Germany; Details of the Conference are Temporarily Not Released

[United Press London 23rd Dispatch] A conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France opened here today to discuss the German economic issues that have been unresolved since the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference last year. The Soviet Union was not invited. The five main issues to be resolved at the conference are: (1) the participation of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg in the conference; (2) the merger of the French occupation zone with the British and American occupation zones; (3) the handling of the Ruhr region; (4) the border issue of Germany; (5) the issue of Germany's participation in the Marshall Plan in the future. It is reported that the Soviet Union protested against this conference, saying that it would never recognize any decisions made at the conference. The United Kingdom and France did not reply to it, and the United States rejected the Soviet Union's protest, saying that the conference was absolutely necessary. The American delegation will be led by the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas. Although it has not been officially announced, it is believed that the three countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg will participate in the conference at least partially. Due to the instability of the French political situation, the three countries decided that the conference would be held in secret.

American sources here said: Although U.S. dollars must be used to avoid the redization of the French occupation zone, Washington does not want to "threaten" France to participate in the three-zone agreement. The United States believes that the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries do not need to participate in the three-zone negotiations, because this is purely an administrative issue of the three occupation zones. However, the United States firmly believes that without the participation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries, no other problems can be solved.

[Associated Press London 22nd Dispatch] Responsible diplomatic officials claimed that the United States will act to place West Germany in a leading position in accordance with the Marshall Plan at the Three-Nation Conference. The United Kingdom and France are willing to cooperate, but on the condition of strictly guaranteeing the prevention of the re-emergence of German military power. This security issue will be discussed first. The United Kingdom has therefore suggested that a political and military alliance be concluded with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and other teams of countries. Although the four countries of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have expressed their agreement in principle on this, they believe that it is necessary to ensure that all countries can cooperate in the future to prevent aggression from any direction. In order to meet this requirement, the United Kingdom has agreed to allow the three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to provide opinions on the West German Conference, but only limited to the general policy issues of West Germany, and not to the management issues. There are three general policy issues: (1) Rebuilding German industry. How should this industry, which is very easy to turn into military production, be prevented? (2) International co-management of the Ruhr coal and iron zone. Regarding this point, France requires international co-management, the United Kingdom advocates taking a certain state-owned approach, and the United States advocates taking a free enterprise system. (3) The German political system adopts a centralized system, or, as France suggested, organizes a federation, implements local decentralization, and has no military unity. The attitude of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on this has a great relationship with the future of West Germany. This matter may be clear tomorrow. All countries take security guarantees as a prerequisite, and France obviously has a bad attitude. French Foreign Minister Pichon said that security must be guaranteed first, and then France will allow its occupation zone to merge with the British and American occupation zones.

### Truman to Submit New Estimate for Aid to Greece and Turkey This Week; Most of It for Ordnance and Equipment

[United Press Washington 23rd Dispatch] Government officials said on the 23rd that President Truman will submit a new estimate for aid to Greece and Turkey to Congress this week.

[Reuters London 23rd Dispatch] It was announced here this morning that the British government handed over a note to the Egyptian Ambassador to the United Kingdom on January 15 to be forwarded to the Egyptian government, which suggested that the two countries immediately hold talks to discuss the constitutional reform of Sudan. It is understood that Egypt has not yet expressed its agreement so far.

[Reuters Cairo 23rd Dispatch] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy told reporters today that he felt that the draft amended order on the constitutional reform of Sudan submitted by Sudan Governor-General Sir Howe to the British government was not sound.

### Preventing Holy Land War: Britain Considers New Plan

Jewish Council Condemns British Attitude

[United Press Lebanon, 23rd] Reliable sources claim that Britain has proposed a plan to avoid war in Palestine. Arab Supreme Commander Kay Huijia has already agreed to halt the full-scale offensive. However, the terms of this "peace proposal" have not been disclosed. These sources say that the plan is available for reference in Washington, London, and Lake Success to draft a new Palestine plan, possibly an alternative to the partition plan, but without damaging the prestige of the United Nations, and to avoid war and the danger of the Middle East's security being exploited by the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] The UN Security Council is scheduled to discuss on Tuesday whether to set a precedent by dispatching international forces to implement the Palestine partition plan. Its resolution will have a significant impact on the future of the United Nations. The Jewish Council submitted a memorandum to the Security Council today, accusing Britain of accommodating Arab opposition to partition. It argues that Britain's neutrality in Palestine weakens Jewish defenses and seriously threatens peace.

### Completion of the Election of Japan's New Prime Minister: Ashida Actively Forming a New Cabinet; Cabinet Member List Largely Drafted

[Associated Press Tokyo, 23rd] The process of Ashida's election as Japan's new prime minister was completed on the 23rd. Ashida plans to pay a courtesy visit to General MacArthur. Ashida will begin actively forming the cabinet on the 24th.

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] The Rules Committees of both houses have decided to convene and pass a motion to adjourn parliament for 20 days, allowing Ashida to form a cabinet during this period and draft legislation to be submitted to parliament.

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] The work of forming Ashida's new cabinet in Japan began today, but apart from formal visits to the leaders of various parties, there were no other talks. Formal negotiations will have to wait for future meetings of representatives from the Democratic, Socialist, and Cooperative parties. Currently, there is still disagreement between the Democratic and Socialist parties regarding the number of cabinet positions allocated. The Democratic Party advocates: Democratic Party 8, Socialist Party 7, Cooperative Party 2. The Socialist Party argues that the allocation should be proportional to the number of seats held by each party in the House of Representatives, which would be: Socialist Party 8, Democratic Party 7, Cooperative Party 2. Although there is only a one-seat difference between the two parties, it is generally believed that this issue will be difficult to compromise. According to sources from Ashida's cabinet formation headquarters, the list of Ashida's cabinet members has been largely drafted, but it still awaits final decisions with the Socialist and Cooperative parties. For the Democratic Party members entering the cabinet, in addition to Ashida concurrently serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs as the Prime Minister, there are: Sadakichi Ichimatsu (reappointed), Kozaemon Kimura (undecided), Takeo Kurisu (reappointed), Tokutaro Kitamura (Home Affairs, or Commerce and Industry, or Agriculture and Forestry), Giichi Takeda (Communications), Gisaburo Tomabechi (Chief Cabinet Secretary), Heitaro Inaba or Yoshio Sakurai (Minister of State) (seven to be selected from nine); Those hoped to be entered into cabinet from Socialist Party include: Tetsu Katayama or Suehiro Nishio (appointed as Foreign Minister with the qualification of Deputy Prime Minister), Chozo Mizutani (Home Affairs or Commerce and Industry), Tatsuo Morito (reappointed), Yuyuu Suzuki (reappointed), Kanju Kato (Labor or Home Affairs), with the remaining one or two positions to be selected from Kazuo Nagae, Eiji Tomikichi, or Ushiro Ito. As for Masaru Nomizo, he will not be invited to join the cabinet because he did not vote for Ashida in the Prime Ministerial nomination vote. Those from the Cooperative Party hoped to enter cabinet are Takeo Miki or Kyoji Funada, and Seiichi Okada. If Miki does not enter the cabinet, then Funada and Okada will enter the cabinet.

### Liberal Party Decides Not to Participate in the New Cabinet

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] Following a meeting of the party's top executives yesterday, Liberal Party President Yoshida convened a general meeting of staff, resolving the following: (1) Reject participation in Ashida's coalition cabinet, and a statement will be issued after a general meeting of affiliated members tomorrow; (2) Work on the new party will continue actively. To ensure the smooth progress of this work, it has been decided to first dissolve the Liberal Party, with the hope of successfully forming the new party by the end of February. As for the name of the new party, it will be jointly negotiated by representatives from all factions participating in the new organization, but the name "Democratic Liberal Party" may be adopted. The policy of the new party is currently being drafted by the Liberal Party side, and it will be completed within a day or two, and will be jointly decided by all factions in the future.

### Our Side Accuses Itagaki of Directing Puppet Show

Induced Wang Jingwei and Puyi to Form Puppet Governments

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] Our prosecutor, Xiang Zhexun, accused war criminal Seishiro Itagaki in the International Military Tribunal today, holding him fully responsible for Wang Jingwei's escape from Chongqing in 1939 and Puyi's secret departure from Tianjin in 1932 after the Shenyang Incident. Xiang stated: "Puppet organizations" were Itagaki's favorite strategy to carry out his conspiracy of economic exploitation and political control of Northeast China and other regions. Xiang claimed that Itagaki had ordered Wang Jingwei to assume the position of head of the "Nanjing Puppet Government" under the guise of "peace," and before that, he had induced him to form a puppet government in the name of independence to assume the position of puppet in the "Manchukuo Puppet Government."

### Prague Teeming with Armed Police: Communists Plotting to Seize Power; Benes Still Intends to Try to Form a Coalition Cabinet

[Associated Press Prague, 23rd] The Communist Party launched a three-pronged offensive on the 23rd to seize power in Czechoslovakia. The Communist Party has armed the police in Prague, occupied the headquarters of the National Socialist Party, and prohibited Czech citizens from traveling abroad. Police carrying new weapons appeared on the streets on the morning of the 23rd, as the Communist Party's attempt to seize power through peaceful means in parliament has failed due to President Benes's refusal.

The above three measures were all ordered to be implemented by Communist Interior Minister Nosek. He also ordered the arrest of Urazin, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Slovak Democratic Party, who resigned at the end of last year and was accused of treason. It is generally believed that the ban on foreign travel and the police's accusation against Urazin are part of the Communist Prime Minister, Gottwald's, plan to seize complete control of the government, hoping to establish an "Iron Curtain"-style "police state." Communist trade union leaders support Gottwald's call for factories to hold a one-hour general strike on the 24th, threatening to paralyze the entire country with a general strike if their demands are not met. The Communist Party's strike appeal includes demands to change the constitution according to the Communist line and complete the nationalization of various industries. It is believed that this is an action to help Gottwald fight against President Benes.

[Agence France-Presse Prague, 23rd] After returning to Prague yesterday afternoon, Czech President Benes held talks with various political figures, but no official information has been released on this matter. However, according to a political figure, the Communists do not oppose the formation of a new cabinet including all parties and factions. However, in order to enhance their position in the cabinet so that they do not constantly rely on the support of the Social Democratic Party, it is rumored that the Communist Party is trying to include representatives from trade unions and other large national organizations that obey Communist orders in the new cabinet. The same source also said that although the Communist Party does not oppose members of the Catholic Party rejoining the cabinet, they will refuse to cooperate with the Socialist National Party. It is rumored that Communist Prime Minister Gottwald will select the leader who can ultimately participate in the cabinet from the Socialist National Party to join the cabinet.

### Soviet Union Commemorates Red Army Day; Land Forces Commander Urges Soldiers to Prepare for War Tirelessly

[Reuters London, 22nd] Moscow Radio broadcast the message to the soldiers delivered by Soviet Minister of Military Affairs Marshal Bulganin on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, stating that as long as imperialism exists, the Soviet Union itself is at risk of being attacked at any time. The soldiers of the Soviet Army must be ready at all times, sparing no cost and under any conditions, to protect the honor and interests of the Soviet Union.

Thirty years ago, after the Bolshevik Party and the leaders of the Soviet people, Lenin and Stalin, achieved the greatest victory of the social revolution, the Soviet Army and Navy were established. The Soviet government resolutely implements its peace-loving foreign policy, as the vanguard of progressive forces, striving for reasonable and lasting peace and international security. Stalin's just policy is deeply supported by the people's democracies and all friends of peace and freedom around the world. The Soviet army is tasked with defending this policy. In the post-war period, the Soviet army has continued to achieve success in military and political training, but it must not become complacent as a result. The Soviet army must never abandon any effort to fulfill its current obligations. Marshal Bulganin also ordered that on the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Army, thirty salvoes of artillery be fired in Moscow, the capitals of the Soviet republics, and several other cities. Fireworks were set off in Moscow at night, and theaters staged plays related to the Red Army.

Subordinates Cannot Cooperate With Superiors

In August 1943, before President Roosevelt set off for Quebec, he asked Welles to resign from his position as Undersecretary of State. He called Welles into his office in the White House and explained this to him.

In the previous few weeks, the President and I had talked about Welles's problem more than once. We agreed that Welles should resign and be sent abroad to take on a special mission, responsible for the new work related to this mission.

I am unwilling to describe in detail some of the problems caused by Undersecretary of State Welles, as there is no point in doing so. These problems have been increasing for two or three years. The Rio de Janeiro Conference in January 1942 showed an attitude of his, which was not new to me - that he was always prepared to make important decisions without consulting me.

From the beginning of our relationship, I always tried to give him reasonable freedom to carry out his work. I often told him to go directly to the President, especially when I was too busy in the State Department, and told him to handle matters with the President that he was handling. This was in line with my policy, which was that colleagues close to me, the Undersecretary of State, counselors, and Assistant Secretaries of State should go to the President themselves to handle various special matters, as long as I knew about it. I felt that this occasional contact could give them more experience, greater hope, and a deeper interest in their work, and could reduce some of my heavy burden, a burden that weighed heavily on the shoulders of the Secretary of State, especially during these difficult times we were experiencing.

But I found that Welles abused this privilege, sometimes going to the President without my knowledge, or even trying to get a decision without my knowledge. Part of the reason for this tendency may have been because Mr. Roosevelt and Welles were old friends in terms of family relationships, and had similar backgrounds in terms of society and school.

During a period when the war in Europe was increasingly heading towards an outbreak, the official business in the State Department piled up higher month by month, so I approved Welles to receive many or most of the ambassadors and ministers who wished to visit the State Department. Of course, I always tried to meet all the diplomatic representatives who wanted to see me, and I always kept in touch with them on important matters. In addition, for important matters, Welles should bring foreign representatives to me, or tell them to come and see me themselves.

In the end, I soon discovered that he did not do so in many cases, although I had made it clear that I must meet these representatives in such cases, no matter how busy I was. Later, when an important ambassador looked at me at my request and I wanted him to come again to continue the discussion, he immediately raised his hands and said that I should talk to Mr. Welles first. This situation gradually but constantly deepened.

I began to notice that Welles was conducting private correspondence with our diplomats and other government officials, which should normally be handled through the official channels of the State Department. He often sent them personal notes, asking them to give personal replies, while in fact this matter should be handled normally with the State Department's notes. The bad effect of this method was that he took many negotiation or discussion items into his own hands, while this matter should normally allow me and the directly relevant officials of the State Department to better understand its general situation.

In the late spring of 1942, Welles gave two speeches on diplomatic issues, which tended to put our government on a new path in foreign policy. The more important one was given at Arlington Cemetery Memorial Day, discussing our post-war plans, at which time Foreign Minister Molotov was visiting the United States. In these two speeches, Welles did not consult with me in advance about his new ideas.

On June 20, 1942, I called Welles into my office and pointed out to him that no Undersecretary of State or Assistant Secretary of State had ever had the authority to propose any degree of new foreign policy, and that such authority does not exist now. I cannot allow the attempt to have the Secretary of State and the Undersecretary of State coordinate their work as two leaders, or to have the Undersecretary of State solely responsible for this task.

I also said that according to the clearly defined rules of the State Department, no Undersecretary of State or Assistant Secretary of State can go directly to the President for any official business, unless the President is concerned, or the Secretary of State knows and permits it. No one knows this point more clearly than Welles himself. I said that my granting him unprecedented rights to go to the White House may have been a mistake on my part, because as far as I know, none of his predecessors had ever had this privilege.

Welles replied that he did not know that he had expounded on new foreign policy in his speech. Then he said that, in view of what I had said, he would completely stop giving speeches in the future.

I replied that his speeches were wonderful, and I hoped that he would even give a hundred speeches to support the war; the only thing I had in mind was that the issue of new foreign policy should be avoided in his speeches, unless we had agreed on it beforehand.

What surprised me was that Welles, until the end of the conversation, still confused two completely different speeches and insisted that he would not give any more speeches in the future. Another thing that surprised me was that he said that in one of his conversations with the President, the latter had said that he himself did not want to give any speeches on post-war issues, but that it would be fine for other people in the government to give a few as trial balloons.

I replied that Welles had not told me that he had held this conversation with the President, and moreover, this was fundamentally inconsistent with his initial argument that he had not felt that new foreign policy had been mentioned.

Our conversation had the effect of clearing the air for the time being. Later, Welles still gave speeches on diplomatic issues, but he consulted with me in advance. But he did not stop going directly to the President over my head. I did not have the same faith in him as I did in my other colleagues.

I felt that regardless of Welles's education and training in diplomacy, his views on certain important issues and policies were narrower and less sound than those of my other colleagues. Before the outbreak of war in Europe, we had different opinions on armed intervention in Cuba and on the assessment of the results of the Munich Conference. After the outbreak of the war, we had different opinions on the neutrality zone in the Western Hemisphere and on the proposed Aide-Mémoire to Japan, which Roosevelt and Churchill had agreed on at the Atlantic Conference, and Welles was an advisor during its drafting. I felt that this document might have led to war with Japan at that time, when we were not as prepared as we were when the Pearl Harbor incident occurred. After the Pearl Harbor incident, we had conflicting opinions on how to deal with Argentina at the Rio de Janeiro Conference, the nature of his speech, and the organization of post-war international security institutions.

These differences of opinion were sometimes due to differences in thought, and sometimes due to differences in opinion on the more practical and effective methods of dealing with major issues, not to mention that Welles was often unwilling to cooperate with me. This situation was particularly acute in the second half of his service in the State Department, and was quite detrimental to those of us who worked together.

For several years, I had hoped that Welles would supervise the administrative work of the State Department in the most effective way possible, which is the normal task of the Undersecretary of State, so that the Secretary of State could devote more time to policy formulation. But Welles seemed to be greatly distracted by other matters, and as a result, those who could express opinions in the State Department were deeply disappointed with the results of his handling of administrative work. After Stettinius took over as Undersecretary of State, I instructed him to completely reorganize the administrative work of the State Department.

The President himself also began to experience the extent of Welles's disloyalty to me. He was particularly dissatisfied with Welles's Arlington Cemetery speech, complaining more than once because he had not consulted with either of us beforehand. He told me that he had later advised Welles on this speech. On one occasion, he told me that Welles had made a suggestion to him, requesting that he be sent to take on a prescribed mission, but the President did not mention what the nature of this mission was. Mr. Roosevelt severely criticized Welles for not having consulted with me before making this suggestion.

I could have gone to the President to resolve the Welles issue and insisted that he make a choice between Welles and me. But I have always been in the habit of cooperating with people, not of opposing them. The work of the State Department is now very complex, and Welles is a hard worker, and if he could serve on a basis of loyalty, I would rather use him than discard him.

But in the early summer of 1943, the President himself found that this situation in the State Department could not continue. He himself decided that, given the current circumstances—details need not be given—the effectiveness of the State Department could be improved by Welles's resignation. He and I agreed that Welles's dismissal should be made easier for him, that is, by the President expressing his willingness to send him to South America or the Soviet Union in the capacity of traveling ambassador to take on a special mission.

When the President asked him to resign, he made this suggestion to Welles, pointing out to him that he could therefore leave the State Department without causing unnecessary speculation.

Welles did not give the President a definite answer to this suggestion. Immediately after talking with Mr. Roosevelt, he came to my office. He expressed his belief that the President's actions were due to my intentions. I told him the whole truth, including that the President had acted after his own deep consideration, regardless of whether his actions were the result of any suggestions from me.

So I urged him to accept the President's suggestion to take on a special mission, especially mentioning a conference in Moscow. Welles immediately replied in a firm tone that such a trip would not be fruitful. He soon stood up, went to my desk, shook hands with me, and then left. Since then, I have not spoken to him.

I soon went to attend the Quebec Conference. Welles went to Burma. He did not accept the President's suggestion to take on a special mission, and wrote a letter of resignation, which he mailed from Burma to the White House.

### Opening Address by the Speaker of the City Council: Promoting and Urging the Suppression of Rebellion and Implementation of Constitutionalism; Citizens Should Jointly Be Responsible for Maintaining Local Security; Stabilizing People's Livelihoods is the Top Priority for Municipal Construction

[Our Newspaper's Report] The first session of the fifth assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Council was grandly opened at 9:30 yesterday morning in the council's auditorium on Tanggu Road, with 163 councilors in attendance. In addition to the mayor and directors of various municipal bureaus, Yan Zhuang, Jiangsu Provincial Commissioner, Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court, and Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Garrison District, also participated.

The opening ceremony began with an opening address by Speaker Pan, which was filled with solemn warnings. Subsequently, Mayor Wu and Councilor Fei Shusheng, representing the councilors, delivered speeches.

The first meeting began at around 10:00 a.m. The Secretary-General gave a report, and after discussing the agenda, Mayor Wu reported on the administration's policies. No meeting was held in the afternoon. The second meeting will be held from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. today, followed by work reports from the Directors of the Finance, Education, and Land Affairs Bureaus. Councilors will then raise questions to the respective bureaus, to which the directors will respond.

In his opening address, Speaker Pan said: "Today, our council is holding its fifth meeting, coinciding with the beginning of the spring of the 37th year [of the Republic of China]. As the saying goes, 'The year's plan starts in spring.' I believe none of our colleagues fail to feel an added sense of responsibility. I, Gongzhan, humbly serving as Speaker, would first like to share my personal feelings for your consideration.

In terms of the national situation, this year is the year for the nation to implement constitutionalism and should also be the year to correct disorder and return to order. Chairman Chiang instructed us: 'The suppression of rebellion and the implementation of constitutionalism are two sides of the same coin in nation-building. Suppressing rebellion can remove obstacles to constitutional government, while implementing constitutionalism can establish confidence in democracy.' As the representative body of public opinion in China's largest city, this council should take the lead in establishing a model for democratic politics in our city, while also fulfilling its responsibilities to directly and indirectly encourage citizens, urge the government, and dedicate ourselves to suppressing rebellion to remove obstacles to constitutional government. However, whether it is constitutionalism or suppressing rebellion, the people's most basic requirements are survival and livelihood. People in war-torn areas already feel threatened for survival, while people in the rear areas also feel threatened for their livelihoods. Therefore, in plain terms, the minimum condition people currently hope for is simply 'peace and prosperity.' But how can people live in peace and prosperity? Recently, U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart Leiden, said: 'There are many selfless people in China. If they can effectively unite to promote the will of the people, they can assist the government and benefit the country.' He also said: 'China now has a constitution to determine the framework of the country. If the people can contribute their efforts under the constitution, they can assist the government in completing the modernization of the democratic system.' As the representative body of public opinion in this city, and as the representatives of the citizens, our council bears the responsibility of promoting the will of the people, and should also effectively unite selflessly. As the constitution begins to be implemented today, we should express the true will of the people to the government, so that the government can respect the true will of the people at all times and in all places, using it as a guideline for its policies. Then, I dare believe that not only can peace and prosperity be guaranteed, but the severe crisis facing the nation can also be averted. U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall has repeatedly said: 'The main solution to China's problems largely requires the efforts of the Chinese themselves.' We share the same sentiment. What he means by 'Chinese themselves' of course refers not only to officials of the Chinese government, but includes each and every one of us. Mr. Gu Yanwu has a famous saying: 'Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation.' Today's situation has truly reached a critical juncture for the survival of the nation. Every citizen has a responsibility and should stand up and take responsibility. Moreover, Shanghai is China's largest international city, and we, the colleagues of this council, are the representatives of the citizens of this largest city. We must at least have some suggestions and contributions regarding the minimum hope of the citizens for peace and prosperity. Furthermore, regarding how the nation's political system can better broaden avenues for speech, recruit talent, advocate the rule of law, and practice democracy to achieve the purpose of correcting disorder and returning to order, we should not limit ourselves to local affairs and underestimate ourselves, but should raise our voices and actively move forward, shouldering the responsibility of planning and urging. Shanghai is no ordinary place. The words and actions of Shanghai citizens are watched and listened to by the whole country, and are greatly related to order and chaos. This is something that the colleagues of this council cannot but hold with diligent self-exhortation.

### Organizing Local Armed Forces to Protect Lives and Property

Regarding the security of this city, it seems that society has been somewhat turbulent in the past month. At the end of last month and the beginning of this month, within five days, there were three incidents of varying degrees of disruption to order: students insulting the mayor, dancers destroying the Social Affairs Bureau, and workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory occupying the factory and resisting military police. Fortunately, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu, and Police Bureau Director Yu and other responsible officials responded effectively and handled the situation properly, which was able to eliminate the disasters and prevent them from expanding. The communist bandit Ding Xishan's group also harassed the outskirts of the city, but due to the close cooperation and mobile encirclement by the army and local teams of neighboring counties under the command of Commander Xuan, they were quickly wiped out. For the sake of the security of the entire city, the colleagues of this council cannot but first express our deep appreciation to the local officials. However, maintaining local security and rectifying order, under today's circumstances, should not rely solely on the government, but should be the shared responsibility of the people. How can we make the basic self-governing Baojia organizations in this city more valued by the government and more rigorously organized and trained to assist in investigation and prevention of wrongdoing? How can we, in accordance with central government laws and regulations, urgently raise funds and organize local self-defense forces to assist the national army in defending our homes, use local tax revenue to support local militias, and use local militias to protect local lives and property? This has become an extremely urgent matter today. Only in this way can we contain bandits, protect local areas, and contribute to suppressing rebellion. The colleagues of this council, witnessing the danger of the times and the turmoil of society, cannot but rise up quickly, mobilize the people, and assist the government in completing its task of maintaining security.

### Applying a Focus-Based Approach to Future Municipal Construction

Regarding municipal construction, at a time when prices are high and the treasury is stretched thin, it seems that all construction must adopt a focus-based approach. Otherwise, if we try to do everything and want to handle everything, the result will be that everything is abandoned and nothing is accomplished. If this premise is not mistaken, then I, Gongzhan, believe that when the council examines the municipal government's budget, colleagues should abandon their own local perspectives and plan for the entire city. We should appropriately measure what should be done first, what should be delayed, what should be done by the city, and what can be done by the districts. Where should the focus of this year's municipal administration be placed? It still awaits the proposal of the municipal government and the discussion of our colleagues, but there is no doubt that there must be a central focus. In my humble opinion, no matter what kind of construction the government undertakes, it should first strive to stabilize people's livelihoods. At this time and in this place, everything should prioritize stability, seeking progress and prosperity only after stability. People in times of war only ask to make a living in a stable environment! Only with stability can we talk about construction; only with stability can we talk about democracy. Therefore, any good facilities or any appealing measures, if they do not help stabilize people's livelihoods, or if they hinder social stability, or even if they can potentially sow seeds of chaos and create social unrest, then regardless of the central or local government, for the sake of the overall situation, it would be better to temporarily postpone them in this city. We must avoid aiming too high and pursuing novelty. Before things are even started, the people are already suffering from their harshness. The saying that the ancients often cited as a warning, "A harsh government is fiercer than a tiger," is precisely what this means!

### People Have No Extravagant Expectations at This Time, But Only Ask to Eliminate the Threat to Their Livelihoods

Secondly, the people have no extravagant expectations at this time, but only ask that the government can passively reduce some of the threats to their livelihoods, which would be sufficient. For example, food and other daily necessities can gradually be distributed fairly and selflessly; rent standards can be adjusted to be more reasonable; and the municipal government can gradually provide some affordable public housing, so that citizens with low incomes do not have to worry about not being able to pay rent; rugged and muddy roads can be slightly leveled; accumulated and dirty garbage can be gradually cleaned up; public transportation can appropriately increase the number of trips without constantly raising prices; in places where people often drink dirty water, there can be some public taps with running water for drinking; remote suburbs can have public telephones to meet urgent needs; electricity can be automatically saved as much as possible, without alarming fines, or without frequent power outages affecting production; more public central primary schools can be established, so that parents do not feel hopeless and unable to send their children to school because they cannot afford to pay tuition. All those who violate the law should be fairly punished by the law, so that innocent citizens do not suffer extrajudicial persecution and lose their due freedoms and rights; tax collection can be effectively rectified to eliminate embezzlement, without having to focus solely on raising tax rates... Things like these, in a basic modern country and modern city, are what people feel are urgently needed and have the right to demand. As long as the government can carefully observe the people's hidden needs, and earnestly do its best within its capabilities, I believe that even without much construction to boast about, it will certainly gain the sincere support and cooperation of the colleagues of this council and the citizens of the entire city. The colleagues of this council, being in the position of representatives of the citizens, cannot but express the expectations of the people, appeal to alleviate the suffering of the people, and are extremely willing to cooperate with the government to improve the situation.

### With Rights Come Obligations: Pay National Taxes and Serve in the Military

Finally, I, Gongzhan, would like to frankly tell all my fellow citizens that our citizens have rights, but they also have obligations. Ambassador Stuart said: "The only hope for China and other countries to achieve democracy lies in its people recognizing their rights and obligations." This is truly a golden and precious saying. We have our basic freedoms and rights to the local and national level in the Constitution, which are stipulated in Chapter II, but at the same time, we also have the obligation to pay taxes and serve in the military. If we want to be masters of the country and masters of the city, then we must pay national taxes and local taxes, without evading taxes. This is the true meaning of contributing money. We must serve in the military, enlisting when we reach the age and taking responsibility personally. This is the true meaning of contributing effort. As for national laws, they are the track for maintaining social order and public interests, and everyone should abide by them. Needless to say, we expect government officials to be servants of democratic politics, and we must even more supervise our own responsibilities as masters of democratic politics. This council was established during the period of political tutelage and has lasted for a year and a half. Now it has entered the constitutional stage. Soon, after the promulgation of the Municipal Self-Government Law based on the Constitution, this city will have a municipal assembly organization. Therefore, the colleagues of this council, no matter where they come from regionally, professionally, or from which party, should lead by example and establish a good foundation for local democratic politics for the future elected municipal assembly. We are extremely willing to learn from the style of parliaments in advanced democratic countries, and can argue fiercely for a case until our faces turn red in order to make the voting as perfect as possible, but we will never hold grudges for the failure to win a case. We will devote ourselves wholeheartedly, work together harmoniously, seek only the welfare of the majority of citizens, and focus only on cultivating the atmosphere of local democratic politics. This is what we especially hope our fellow citizens of the entire city will constantly supervise, teach, and correct. We would be extremely honored."

### The Mayor Hopes the Council's Instructions Will Provide Concrete Guidelines; Fei Shusheng Urges the Implementation of Resolutions

Mayor Wu said in his speech that this fifth session of the first Shanghai Municipal Council includes councilors from both the Minshe [Chinese Democratic Socialist Party] and Qingnian [Chinese Youth Party] parties, and the meeting is even more expanded. At the first meeting, I said that I hoped for "unity between the government and the council." For nearly two years, we have truly achieved "unity between the government and the council." The municipal government has made every effort to implement the cases passed by your council. If there are those that have not been implemented, it is truly due to difficulties in reality. I have heard the Speaker's speech five times, and today's speech is the most painful and touching. This year is the year when the country and the local area are moving towards the light, so it is also the most painful and difficult year. Everyone knows that "the darkest time is before dawn," so we feel the Speaker's instructions are even more important. What are the minimum requirements of the citizens? I hope the council can provide concrete guidelines so that the municipal government can proceed according to these guidelines, and the council can supervise it every day, so that the light can come sooner.

Councilor Fei Shusheng, representing the councilors, replied, saying that although the results of the council's four sessions have been praised by the outside world, some citizens have criticized them as "only speaking for themselves." We should humbly accept the citizens' criticisms and make necessary reviews and improvements. What the council hopes from the municipal government is: (1) When the municipal government submits proposals for discussion, it should conduct detailed research and careful consideration, so as not to pass them hastily in the council and then cause the citizens to complain after they are implemented. (2) All issues should be submitted to the council for discussion before implementation, and the council should not be treated as a mere decoration for implementing democratic politics. (3) It is hoped that the cases already resolved by the council in the past will be implemented as soon as possible.

### Humiliated by Gambling, the Youth Vandalizes and Reports the Case; Gunfire Erupts in the Central Market; Young Street Vendor Seriously Wounded

[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 10:40 a.m. yesterday, a shooting occurred at the intersection of Sichuan South Road and Central Road. The injured person, Fang Qiaosheng, 20 years old, from Hefei, resides at No. 61 Nanlinli, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. He is a used goods vendor who sets up a stall in the Central Market on Sichuan Road, selling surplus U.S. military supplies. At the end of the lunar year, Fang went to gamble on Pai Gow at the upstairs of the Meili Food Company behind the Datong Bank nearby. The dealer at the time was a bodyguard of an important National Government official, named Li Dasheng (26 years old, from Guangdong, residing at No. 22 Panyu Road, Shanghai West). The two suddenly had a dispute due to gambling. At that time, Fang's fellow vendors rallied to help Fang, causing Li to be humiliated and leave in anger. He harbored resentment and secretly plotted revenge. Later, Fang found out about Li's background and dared not set up a stall for half a month. Yesterday morning, at around 10:00 a.m., he secretly came out to set up a stall. After Li received the news, he came with three friends by car, two in military uniforms and two in plain clothes. They went to the Central Market and confronted Fang Qiaosheng, demanding justice. After a disagreement, one of them stepped forward, grabbed Fang's collar, and punched him wildly. The others then surrounded and beat him. At this time, the market was in chaos. Fang's fellow vendors were numerous, but they did not dare to help because the other party was military. Fang was beaten and injured, shouting for help. Fearing that the street police would come, the soldier pulled out a pistol and fired a shot, hitting Fang's right hand, penetrating his palm, and then penetrating from his right abdomen to his right thigh. Blood flowed non-stop, and he fell to the ground. The murderers scattered. At that time, a friend of Fang's stepped forward to defend him and followed them out to chase them. A beautiful American girl, Huai Xi, witnessed everything and also bravely assisted. At the same time, nearby patrol police and patrol police chief No. 4616, No. 1156, police officers No. 2177, No. 2282, police officer No. 2342 and many others joined the encirclement. As a result, the main suspect, Li Dasheng, was arrested and taken to the Huangpu Police Bureau for interrogation. The injured person was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The bullet has been removed by the doctor. It is reported that the injury is serious and his life is in danger.

### Advance Purchase of Third-Class Train Tickets Begins Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to facilitate the travel of government agencies, organizations, schools, and public educators by train, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau has already implemented a reservation system for second-class passenger tickets on all trains. However, third-class tickets have not been processed at the same time. It has now been decided that starting today, all public educators from various government agencies and schools, as well as staff members of formal organizations, can present an official letter or service certificate to the travel service offices set up by the Railway Bureau in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places two days before their departure to purchase third-class train tickets in advance.

### A Strange Guest Appears at the General Assembly; Petitions of Grievances Pour In

[Our Newspaper's Report] During yesterday's meeting of the Municipal Council, an elderly man, 53 years old, named Shi Chenglie, from Wuxing, who works as a clerk at the Shutongshou Chinese Medicine Shop, suddenly came and claimed to be a councilor. He sat in a councilor's seat to participate in the meeting and even printed cards with the title of Municipal Councilor. The council staff felt very surprised and asked him for proof. He took out a ballot from the original election of councilors. This old man actually took it as an election certificate. According to him, he is very enthusiastic about attending council meetings. Friends all said that today is a meeting and recommended him to attend, so he came specifically to participate. The staff knew that he had been fooled and advised him to leave.

As prices rise, the travel expenses for councilors have also increased, to 140,000 yuan per person per day, for a total of ten days.

The seat number one for the councilors is for Councilor He Pinheng of the Minshe Party.

As the conference opened, petitioners poured in. Yesterday, more than a hundred refugees from northern Jiangsu and unemployed workers petitioned again for the issuance of suburban licenses for the tricycles they had made, holding paper flags and lining up opposite the gate. When they saw the mayor come out, they shouted loudly. Also, Wu Guocai, the owner of a small transportation company at No. 138 Dongda Famous Road, was asked by plainclothes police officers from Yulin Road to provide bribes on the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month. Because he did not pay, he was falsely accused of theft and taken away, along with four other shop employees. So far, there has been no news. Therefore, more than twenty members of his family, men, women, old, and young, led by Wu's brother, held flags and burned incense to the council to kneel and beg for justice.

When the mayor reported on the student unrest at Tongji University, he mentioned that they had a slogan that said: "Executioner Xuan Tiewu, Old Fox Wu Guozhen."

Councilors continued to submit proposals, totaling more than fifty to date.

### Mayor Reports on Administration, Presents Two Major Problems, Full Rationing Relies on Assistance and Supervision, Strengthen Baojia Organization, Do Not Believe Rumors

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, Mayor Wu presented a detailed report with charts distributed to each senator at the Senate meeting. He also verbally explained the three most important points for each of the nine bureaus of the municipal government. He specifically pointed out two major problems currently concerning the entire city for senators' reference. These two major problems are: (1) the problem of livelihood; the distribution of rice will be implemented within three months. The United States has indicated that it will only provide further assistance if the implementation results are good, so this effort must be perfect. Therefore, it is hoped that every citizen should understand their obligations and rights, and city senators, district heads, and district representatives are requested to assist and supervise so that no malpractices occur. (3) The problem of security (i.e., the problem of survival); according to the Tongji student unrest on January 29, the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau by the dance industry on January 31, the Shenxin labor unrest on February 2, and the landing of Ding Xishan on February 8, it can be proved that this is a planned struggle by the communist bandits. They regard Shanghai as a large center for concentrated disruption. If their conspiracy succeeds, just imagine what Shanghai will become! Fortunately, the military and police worked hard to eliminate the disaster, which must be attributed to Commander Xuan. However, we can imagine that the communist responsible persons will be blamed by their superiors for the failure and will continue to disrupt. Therefore, the city must pay attention to two things: (1) Strengthen the Baojia organization, (2) Do not believe rumors. The communist bandits spread all kinds of rumors by any means. For example, this time, I was beaten, and rumors said that I was knocked down by the cavalry, which is completely untrue. It was also said that more than 400 Tongji students died in this case, which is "God knows what"! Currently, some so-called student associations for poor students are making unreasonable demands, which are obviously with ulterior motives. Ninety-nine and nine-tenths percent of the workers are good people, so don't be incited by a few bad elements.

Improve Conscription, Increase Police

Regarding the administration of each bureau: (1) Civil Affairs: Handling military service is more important. Shanghai's first military service, with 3,000 quotas all filled, can also be regarded as self-consolation, but there are also shortcomings, such as family allowances and job assignments that have not been completely satisfactory. This year's military service will be further expanded, so it is decided to improve the methods as much as possible. The city's military service conference will be held on the 29th of this month, and the results will be reported at the general meeting.

(2) Police Affairs: It is most difficult to maintain traffic order in the city, but in recent months, traffic police have made considerable progress in performing their duties, and their spirit of maintaining local security is admirable. Strengthening local forces is a major issue in the future. There are a total of 12,000 police officers in Shanghai, which was determined the year before last. At that time, the population was more than 3 million, but now it is nearly 5 million, and the number of police officers has not increased. Especially in the current environment, it is necessary to strengthen them, so it is planned to add one security team, but the funding is not a problem.

Commodity Prices and Disaster Relief Are Most Difficult to Handle

(3) Social Affairs: The Social Affairs Bureau has been working hard for two months to handle the year-end bonus cases, and the high commodity prices make it most difficult to deal with. At 8:30 this morning, I was still discussing rice supply matters with Director Wu and grain merchants. The price of rice in Shanghai is 1.98 million, while the price of rice in Wuxi has reached 2.16 million, resulting in a situation where the price of rice in the producing area is higher than here. Grain merchants feel that they are losing money. If the municipal government wants to raise the price of rice, it will affect the citizens. If it wants to release all the rice, the source will become a problem. This kind of difficulty is "hard to express in words." After three households are allocated rice, it will be of great help, and other items can also be distributed successively. In addition, winter relief work has also been the most difficult thing in the past three months. There are more than 300,000 refugees who have fled to Shanghai, and the fundraising target is 60 billion, but the actual amount received is only more than 20 billion. There is a misunderstanding among the citizens about the charity sale of houses, which should be explained: (1) The houses sold for charity are different from the public housing in Dabuqiao. They are all made of high-quality materials. The current market price of Grade A houses is worth 2.4 billion, and Grade B houses are worth 1.6 billion. (2) The lottery is guaranteed to be absolutely fair and will be held publicly. In addition, the equipment in the third shelter is poor, which is due to the fact that it was originally a reception center for unemployed workers, and the conversion time was short. It has been improved as much as possible in the past two weeks. The establishment of shelters has reduced theft and has achieved a good effect.

(4) Education: (1) The tuition fee issue, the established standard is indeed to take into account the interests of both parents and schools, and it is hoped that citizens can understand. (2) Handling student aid funds, thanks to the enthusiasm of all sectors, 15 billion yuan has been received. However, some student associations have requested 76 billion yuan for scholarship fundraising and also requested tuition fee reductions and salary increases for faculty and staff. This kind of statement is completely irresponsible and contradictory, and there must be a conspiracy. It is not easy to raise 15 billion, where to raise 76 billion.

Cutting Staff and Simplifying Administration Is Difficult

(5) Finance: The handling situation is in accordance with the meaning of the City Council, but recently the Central Government has ordered to increase certain tax revenues, and we have to ask the Council to discuss it. In fact, the rate of increase in commodity prices is very different from the increase in tax revenue. The city government's staff reduction and simplification of administration has been implemented since I took office, but the current situation is difficult. For example, the number of police officers is not enough. (6) Public Works: The Nanshi Wharf has been completely rebuilt within a year, and the Hengfeng Bridge will also be open by the end of March. The biggest problem is dredging the Suzhou River. At the end of the lunar year, rice was not available for two or three days, which was extremely anxious. Later, the police were sent to assist and found that the 15-mile area above Xin泾 has become a one-way waterway, and ships are blocked and cannot pass. This is because the enemy and puppet governments have not dredged it in the past eight or nine years. According to the current commodity prices, it costs 80 billion yuan to dredge every year, and it takes three years to complete. The city government plans to take a part of the 120 billion yuan in customs import duties every year for this purpose, and it can start this year. (7) Public Utilities: When I took office, the city's power generation capacity was 100,000 kilowatts, and now it has increased to more than 200,000 kilowatts. If the City Council can pass the joint power plant case, it can be further improved in the future. The US aid to China loan has also agreed to provide 14 million US dollars for the plant. The purpose of saving electricity is to ensure that the electricity used for production is sufficient and will not be interrupted. The city government does not want to impose fines, but hopes to save. After review, it can save 7,000 kilowatts after saving. Although the amount is not large, if it is not restricted, the amount of waste will be alarming. The saving method may be cancelled or changed during the summer time. It is not possible to increase the price of public utilities. In order to avoid excessive price increases, the city government specially invited personnel from various agencies to jointly review. If the price is not increased, the government must subsidize, and if it is not subsidized, the only option is to close the door.

Rental Standards Submitted for Consideration

(8) Land Administration: Aerial surveys have been completed and can be used. The clearing of civilian land occupied by the enemy and puppets should thank the efforts of the City Council. The Central Government has sent personnel to handle it together. Regarding the issue of rental standards, I believe that there should be a standard, because landlords feel that they are losing money now. After the house price is low, no one is willing to build houses. This standard must also take into account all aspects. This case is requested by the City Council to carefully consider a solution.

(9) Health: When Mayor Wu mentioned health, he praised Director Zhang as a model civil servant, saying that he had no housing when he took office, and now the city government has found a place to live for him. I also know that Director Zhang usually has debts, and the travel expenses for this leave to return to his hometown are also being raised. He has made great contributions to handling health. The reason why garbage is piled up in many places in the city is also because the Suzhou River is silted up, and ships are not easy to export, resulting in slow transportation. This year's epidemic prevention work will pay special attention, and it is expected that its severity will be greater than in previous years.

### Cases of Government Agencies Using Civilian Land, Land Determined to Be Returned Will Be Returned First, Second Resolution of the Review Committee on Civilian Land Occupied

[Our Newspaper] The Review Committee on the Use of Civilian Land Occupied by Enemy and Puppet Organizations in Shanghai by Central Government Agencies of the Executive Yuan held its second meeting yesterday and resolved: (1) To formulate two methods for determining the standard for payment of land occupied by the enemy and puppet organizations to be returned: (A) For land forcibly requisitioned by enemy and puppet organizations, which has been reviewed and returned by this committee, the original owners shall be allowed to pay the land price according to the standard land price set by the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau in the 34th year, and redeem the land. However, if the land price was not fully paid when the enemy and puppet organizations requisitioned the land, the payment shall be made according to the percentage of the price received at that time. (B) Poor small farmers who are indeed unable to pay the fee may be exempted from paying the fee and redeeming the land after being certified by the local district office and approved by the city government. (2) For cases of government agencies using civilian land, the parts that have been reviewed by the small groups and have been decided to be returned by the relevant user agencies will be returned first. For parts that are difficult to return, the usage plan will be submitted to the meeting within a time limit. (3) The Shanghai Experimental Economic Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will return a total of 9.964.744 acres of land in the farm. Among them, civilian land is 6.485.44 acres, enemy property is 1.394.450 acres, public land is 349.740 acres, and property to be investigated is 1.735.110 acres.

### The National Grain Federation Cables to Request Permanent Exemption from Grain Business Tax, Election of Directors and Supervisors Postponed to This Afternoon

### Jiguang Steamer Is Undamaged, Loading Cargo and Sailing to Tianjin Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Beiyang Line Jiguang Steamer, which docked at the Jinliyuan pontoon in the Jiangmian area of ​​the 16th Wharf last Saturday, had more than 1,300 bags of sugar loaded for unloading. Unexpectedly, smoke suddenly appeared in the head cabin at about 7:00 pm. The Jianghai Customs sent a wheel to extinguish the fire. As a result, only one square foot of hemp skin was burned. However, after the cabin was flooded, the water accumulated more than two feet, and some of the sugar was dissolved in water. Fortunately, the hull of the ship was not damaged at all. The tide-affected sugar has been removed, and loading continues. It will sail to Tianjin on schedule tomorrow.

### The Quantity and Price of Sugar Distribution Will Be Redetermined Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] The city's registered sugar was originally distributed at a rate of one catty per person per month. The Resources Committee recently compared it with the fact that Taiwan distributes only half a catty per person per month, believing that the treatment seemed unfair. When Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau went to Beijing this time, he discussed this issue with the Resources Committee. According to Director Wu yesterday, this can be decided when the sugar group of the city's price evaluation committee holds a routine meeting tomorrow. If half a catty is redistributed, then one year will be divided into six periods, and one catty will be distributed in each period. The distribution price will also be redetermined at that time.

### The Industrial and Commercial Crisis Is Like Tangled Hair, Zhao Banfu Talks About Taking Office, Hoping for Labor and Capital to Cooperate Openly

[Our Newspaper] The newly appointed Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Banfu, officially took office and went to the bureau to work yesterday. Among those who went to congratulate him were Yan Huiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Cha Liangjian, and people from the industrial and commercial sectors and heads of workers. Deputy Director Zhao told reporters that he felt quite heavy when he took office in the current situation where the serious situation of industry and commerce is becoming increasingly serious. The current industrial and commercial crisis is like a handful of tangled hair. He personally believes that the key to saving the Chinese industrial crisis should start with the cotton textile industry. The number of cotton textile workers is as high as 100,000, and it is related to the machinery, dyeing, and weaving industries, so it is hoped that all relevant parties will work together to solve the difficulties of the industry. In the past, the Social Affairs Bureau advocated calculating wages based on the cost of living index, which played a major role in stabilizing the city's labor force. Former Deputy Director Li made the greatest efforts in this regard. Looking ahead to the industrial and commercial situation this year, it is feared that serious layoff problems will occur. It is hoped that labor and capital will truly cooperate and be open and honest to overcome this difficulty.

### Discovery of Civilization Relics from Beneath the Gansu Strata

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 19th] The National Gansu Science and Education Hall is currently holding a Science and Education Exhibition from the 15th to the 21st of this month. It is divided into four sections: Physics and Chemistry, Natural History, Birds and Beasts, and Work in Progress Photographs. Among the nearly 3,000 exhibits, from the origin of life to the highest achievements of modern science, explanations are provided in a simple and accessible manner. This helps people understand that beneath the Gansu strata, not only are diverse resources buried – such as petroleum, coal, gypsum, mirabilite, etc. – but also incredibly ancient cultural relics – such as ancient pottery from 4,000 years ago, unearthed in the Tao River basin. The distribution and production of other flora and fauna, the structure and use of electro-education tools, the manufacturing and experimental methods of physical and chemical instruments, and the morphological specimens of birds and beasts, allow farmers who have come to the city for leisure during the Spring Festival to gain a clear understanding in half a day, receive a kind of scientific enlightenment, and correct the errors of legends in their minds. This is a cultural activity that is well worth promoting. On a long table in the Natural History room, more than ten fossilized bones of vertebrate animals are displayed. The types include three-toed horses, woolly rhinoceroses, saber-toothed tigers, turtles, etc. The pale color, rugged shapes, and unfamiliar names to modern people’s minds cause many to stare blankly in front of them. This is the result of more than three years of hard work by researcher Wang Yongyan of the hall, discovered in the remote Longjia Gully of Wudu. These fossilized bones were buried underground at least 500,000 years ago.

From "Human" to "Turtle"

Among these dozen or so fossils, the most sigh-inducing is the turtle shell fossil. Two years ago, it was cherished as a brilliant star in Chinese anthropology. At that time, everyone believed it was a skull fossil of "primitive man." It even had an unofficial scientific name: "Wudu Primitive Man." At the end of July of the 35th year, the reporter visited this skull of the old ancestor for the first time with a reverent mood. When Wang Yongyan took it out of the strictly guarded deep cabinet at the reporter's request for photography, his hands were simply shaking a little. Subsequently, newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai began to introduce this rare discovery. The International Propaganda Department of the Propaganda Department even translated one of the articles into English and published a booklet. In late August of the same year, Wang Xuwu of the Northwest Geological Survey first exposed this "primitive man" mystery, determining that it was a fossil of a turtle shell, which led Yang Zhongjian of the Nanjing Geological Survey to write an article, expressing a lot of emotion.

Now, this legendary fossil has been labeled as a "turtle" of a reptile, mixed among a group of unimportant beasts.

Mistakes Also Have Value

Since "Wudu Primitive Man" became "Turtle," many people in the community have given Wang Yongyan a lot of slander and ridicule. Some people even wrote "Sunday Essays" to criticize him in newspapers. What was Wang's reaction? – From these places, one can see the working attitude and confidence of a true scientist – he ignored these slanders. Last year, he went to Wudu for the fourth excavation. He saw that the fossil layer of Longjia Gully, and only he himself believed that there were countless mammalian fossilized bones in that place. Although its value cannot be said to be the best in the world, it is at least rare in the country.

One evening in early winter last year, the reporter went to the Gansu Science and Education Hall to interview Wang Yongyan. In Wang Yongyan's studio, he met him. He was hunching over his large pile of broken bones. When he caught sight of the reporter, he immediately straightened up, forgot the pleasantries, and began to talk endlessly about his fossils. "Look, the leg of an antelope, the lower jaw of a rhinoceros, the spine of a hyena, the horn of a reindeer, the tooth of an elephant, the lower jaw of a baboon..." – It was still the same old story, but the quantity was much more than the year before (the 35th year). When the reporter asked him how many pieces there were in total, he held up four fingers, "Four thousand pieces! Total weight, three and a half tons."

"You're winning by quantity," the reporter said with a smile.

"No," he said definitively, "Longjia Gully really has a lot. Instead of finding a few fragments to study and then sending them to authoritative scholars for identification, it's very uneconomical in terms of time and money. Therefore, it's better to excavate a large number of them and study, compare, and refer to them together. It's much easier and more accurate."

We talked about the "Wudu Primitive Man" incident. He said seriously, "I am not discouraged by people criticizing my mistakes, and I am not afraid of people's ridicule. I believe that people in the academic world and knowledgeable people in society will not do this. I'll tell you," he simply treated me as his student, "When a scientific expedition from England was working in South Africa, they mistakenly identified the joint bone of an elephant as the skull of a primitive man. Davison Black, an anatomical researcher of Peking Man, once identified the femur of a deer discovered in Shandong as the femur of an ape-man. Even the famous anthropologist Osborn mistakenly identified a molar of a cow discovered in America as the fossil tooth of an ancestor of beauty. All of this is not only not ridiculed by any scholars or experts in the world, but also became an important stage in the history of science – you know, a history of science is a history of scientific errors. Scientific research seeks truth, and any errors in the process are helpful to the discovery of truth and have their value because, after various errors, one can obtain the correct truth. A scientific researcher is not afraid of being laughed at for his mistakes, and at the same time, anyone with a little scientific knowledge will never laugh at him for his mistakes, especially since the 'Wudu Primitive Man' is just beginning to be studied, and the official report has not yet been published..."

Treasure Trove of Fossilized Bones

After visiting the Science and Education Exhibition, the reporter interviewed Wang Yongyan, asking him why only 271 of the fossilized bones were on display, and why the more precious items were not exhibited. Wang said, "First, the place is small, and second, this is for the general public to see, as long as the general public understands that there are these things under the Gansu strata." The reporter asked him to describe the process of discovery. He said, "Just as Mr. Pei Wenzhong said, in these days of frequent wars, who would pay attention to these geological and archaeological works that have little connection with actual life? If your newspaper truly respects academics and needs this kind of material, I do have a summary of a paper that I can give you to publish?" He took out a piece of paper from the drawer and handed it to the reporter, adding, "This is what I read at the annual meeting of the Lanzhou Branch of the Geological Society of China last year. The editor of 'Northwest Forum' (note: this journal will be published in a month) has already collected it and is preparing to compile and print a special issue. I don't care if there are copyright issues in the future." The last sentence was a joke. I began to silently read his summary of the first paper on the fossilized bones of Wudu:

Discovery of the Mammalian Fossil Layer in Wudu (Summary)

In the 34th year of the Republic of China, while working in southern Gansu, more than ten mammalian fossils, such as dogs, sheep, rhinoceroses, and deer, were discovered in the Shengdipo area of Longjia Gully, ninety li north of Wudu County. In the 35th year, with the financial assistance of the Ministry of Education, two excavations were carried out in Shengdipo, lasting more than three months in total. In the spring of the 36th year, with the assistance of the Ministry of Education again, two months of excavation work was carried out at the same place. A total of more than 4,000 fossils were obtained before and after. These fossils have already begun to be repaired, and detailed identification is pending after the repairs are completed.

The strata near the fossil site, from old to new, are as follows: (1) Silurian Period – blue-gray limestone and black phyllite exposed east of Gaojiacun, interspersed with low-quality coal seams; (2) Devonian Period – light gray-blue limestone containing Atrtpa at Tujiaoshan; (3) Carboniferous Period – gray-black, gray-yellow Carboniferous rock, widely exposed near Yewaisi; (4) Permian Period – lower gray-white thick-layered Maokou limestone, upper limestone conglomerate, yellow sandstone, black shale, and Longjiagou coal series mixed with coal seams. Above the coal series, there is gray-white thick-layered limestone, which may be the Maokou limestone thrust over the coal series. In the Shengdipo area, the Maokou Factory limestone is covered with very thick red beds, and the surface is eroded into soil. There are no profiles available for reference within two or thirty li nearby. Only on the west wall of the fossil excavation pit, a profile of five meters and eight long and two meters deep was excavated, with a dip of 20 degrees northward and a strike of 25 degrees west of north. The strata from bottom to top: A, light red, slightly yellowish dense clay layer, one meter thick; B, slightly redder and looser clay layer than A, five decimeters thick; C, same as A, eight decimeters thick; D, same as B, one meter thick; E, slightly gray-white hard sandy clay layer, four decimeters thick; F, same as B, five decimeters thick; G, same as E, four decimeters thick; H, same as B, more than one meter thick. Among them, the fossil-rich layers are B, C, and D. Furthermore, there are five small reverse faults on this small profile.

Since the fossils have not yet been completely repaired, it is not possible to know all the animals they contain at present. However, based on the observation of those that have been repaired, the vertebrate fossil layer in Wudu includes at least the following animals: A, Carnivora, including: leopard (Felidae), jackal (Hgaena), saber-toothed tiger (Machairodus), dog (Canidae), bear (Ursedae), etc.; B, Perissodactyla, including: Dicerorhinus, Chilotheriuns, Sinotherium, Hipparionn, Equus Sameniensis, etc.; C, Artiodadlyla, including: pig (Susidae), antelope (Antelope), etc.; Reptilia, including: turtle (Emydida), etc.; Primate, including: baboon (Gorilla).

In addition to the above fossils, in recent years I have also obtained more than ten fossils of water buffalo, saber-toothed elephants, rhinoceroses, deer, and sheep in the southern township of Xihe County and the northern township of Wudu County."

"Ah, a rich treasure trove of fossilized bones!" After the reporter finished reading Wang's summary of the paper, he couldn't help but exclaim softly.

Unfolding Future Activities

Next, the reporter asked Wang Yongyan about his future plans. He said, "I have now agreed with Mr. Yang Zhongjian of the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Central Geological Survey on the research method. The conditions are as follows: I will transport dozens of representative pieces of the repaired fossilized bones to Nanjing, where Mr. Yang will identify them. According to common practice, the transportation cost to Nanjing will be borne by the Gansu Science and Education Hall, and the transportation cost back will be borne by the Central Geological Survey. The copyright belongs to the Geological Society of China and will be compiled as one of the 'Palaeontologia Sinica'. Mr. Yang and I will jointly sign the publication. As for the cost of going to Nanjing for research and continuing the fifth excavation in Wudu this year, the Science and Education Hall has requested the Ministry of Education to allocate 400 million yuan. The official document was submitted to the Ministry of the Army in January of this year. Because of the approval of the education budget, it has not yet been allocated. However, based on my past requests for subsidies, I have always received special approval from Minister Zhu. Minister Zhu is a senior geologist and is very aware of the importance of this work. This time, there probably won't be any problems."

He also told the reporter that when Mr. Pei Wenzhong went to the Tao River basin for archaeological work in July and August last year, he also went to work with him for a period of time. In the days he spent with Mr. Pei, he realized that Mr. Pei was a very humble scholar. Regarding his excavation situation in Wudu, Yang Zhongjian, China's authority on paleontology, also mentioned the discovery of fossilized bones in Wudu in a journal of the American Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

When we talked about the "Northwest Archaeological Working Team" being organized by Pei, Wang said that according to private information he had received, it was now shelved due to lack of funding. However, Mr. Pei Wenzhong will definitely come to Gansu again during the summer vacation this year to continue working.

About Wang Yongyan

Finally, the reporter will introduce Wang Yongyan, a young scientist from the Northwest. Wang is from Lanzhou City and is only 35 years old this year. In his early years, he studied aviation flight. Due to illness (color blindness), he went to Kyushu, Japan, to study geology at the Minjiu Institute of Technology, and also studied biological archaeology. After the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to the country and served his hometown. From the 27th to the 30th year, he served as an engineer in the Gansu Construction Department, engaged in the economic geological survey and research of Gansu Province. After the 30th year, he entered the National Gansu Science and Education Hall as a natural science researcher, and also served as the director of the promotion department, and still holds this position.

In these long ten years, the first three years were inseparable from "due to; hereby." Only in the 30th year did he begin his geological travel work. In that year, he investigated the geology of southeastern Gansu and southern Shaanxi, and wrote "The Geology and Minerals of Southeastern Gansu." In the 31st year, he investigated the geology of Hexi and wrote "Travel Notes on the Geology of Hexi." In the 32nd year, he investigated the geology of northeastern Gansu and Ningxia and wrote "The Geology of the Jizixia Coalfield" and "Survey Report on the Liujigou Glauber's Salt Mine in Ningxia." In the 33rd year, he investigated the geology of eastern Gansu and wrote "Preliminary Study of the Geology of Eastern Gansu." In the 34th year, he investigated the geology of southern Gansu and wrote "The Xigu Iron Mine." Then, he discovered the vertebrate fossil layer in Wudu, and he spent the remaining three years or so on the excavation, sorting, and research of fossils.

In addition to these geological survey works in the field, he also paid attention to the abundant resources of Gansu and wrote two books, one is "Salt in the Northwest" and the other is "Resources of Gansu." These works are indispensable reference materials for subsequent workers.

The reporter is unwilling to excessively praise this young scientific worker who is dedicated to his work, but only feels that he is admirable. He is a devout Christian, does not drink or smoke, and is always working with such vigor. We can imagine that in the highlands and wilderness of the Northwest, in the deep mountains rarely visited by people, under the scorching sun, in the storm, even the sudden downpour of rain and snow is difficult to find a place to shelter – unless it is under a mountain rock or in a kiln – in the environment, he carries his luggage, brings his instruments, walks alone, and observes carefully. Unless you have experienced it yourself, you will not know the joys and sorrows.

"Developing the Northwest" and "Building the Northwest" can we lack this kind of person? (Our reporter Song Bingcai)

### The Mystery of the Murder of Xu Shouchang, Chairman of the Chinese Literature Department of National Taiwan University

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 23rd] The news that Xu Shouchang (Jifu), Chairman of the Chinese Literature Department of National Taiwan University, was suddenly assassinated around 3 a.m. on the 19th has been reported by our reporter via special telegram. Now, the details of the incident are described as follows:

Xu Shouchang was a famous scholar of sixty-six years old. He was a fellow villager of Chen Yi and Zhou Shuren, and a senior returnee from Japan. After Taiwan's restoration, he was recruited to Taiwan by Chief Executive Chen to serve as the director of the Provincial Compilation and Translation Hall. After the reorganization of the provincial government, the hall was abolished, and he took office as the chairman of the Chinese Literature Department of National Taiwan University. He was not only a diligent scholar, but also a kind and honest excellent mentor to young people. In the past two years, he has devoted himself to the writings of Taiwanese literature and history, and has worked hard to discover the relics of Dunhuang. He still lived the most austere literary life.

In his diary, from January 25th to February 16th, two things happened one after another. One was the theft of his salary at the school, and the other was the burglary of his residence. The old man believed in fate before his death, but in the end he could not escape the manipulation of fate. The third time he was killed. The circumstances of the murder were too tragic. The murderer climbed over the low wall, stabbed him four or five times in the neck, and once on the cheek. There was a pool of blood on the mat, and the room was in a mess. It happened around 3 a.m. It was not until dawn at 6:30 a.m. that his eldest daughter Shiwei (a sophomore at the College of Agriculture of National Taiwan University), who lived in another room, urged the two maidservants who were like children to see why the master, who was usually an early riser, was late. As a result, they found the old man, who was still alive last night, lying horizontally on the bamboo bed, with his neck bloody and the blood vessels not broken. Only then did the eldest daughter rush to inform her classmates and report to the police. The military, police, and court sent personnel to the scene for inspection. Reporters and friends also rushed to express their condolences.

Excerpts from several pages of the deceased's diary before his death: (Please refer to the end of this article)

Therefore, many people felt that Zhou Jiafeng, a 28-year-old teaching assistant from Hebei, seemed to be quite suspicious. However, in the morning after the incident, he went to look for his teacher Shiying (the deceased's eldest son, currently an associate professor at the Teachers College, who lives separately). The deputy director of the police department, Liu Geqing's, assumption was somewhat negative. He said: If it was a thief who had stolen his things before, and came to steal again (the murderer seemed to deliberately create a false impression, and stole a suitcase when leaving, which contained cheap summer clothes), then why kill him? And judging from the murder weapon, a firewood knife, and the five or six knife wounds in the same part of the neck, it must not be a handsome and bold habitual criminal. But judging from the bloodstains far from the bed, the deceased must have resisted, but why didn't the resistance make any noise, and the sound of the final struggle couldn't wake up the daughter and the maidservant? Although the maidservant is very young, perhaps she doesn't understand anything.

By 10 p.m. on the 23rd, the police department announced that the murderer who killed Xu Shouchang was Gao Wanche, a 22-year-old former worker at the Compilation and Translation Hall, who had been fired. After being fired, he repeatedly committed theft of stolen goods. The bloody clothes were found in Taoyuan. The police department solved the case in three and a half days, which can be said to be quite swift.

Xu's body was made up by the National Taiwan University Hospital and was laid to rest at his residence at 3 p.m. on the 20th. Officials from National Taiwan University, the Teachers College, and the provincial government all shed tears and handled the funeral for the deceased. The cash left by the deceased was only NT$1,000. (Our special correspondent Jiang Muyun)

January 25th The money is for the "Dunhuang Research" manuscript.

January 29th Received a letter from Jingsong, saying that he had sent a copy of the biography of Lu Xun.

February 6th In the morning, I went to school and told Zhou Jiafeng to collect his salary (additional payment). More than 24,000 yuan. Because I was proofreading, I put it next to my leather suitcase first. After I finished proofreading, I wanted to go to the toilet, so I temporarily put the money in the drawer and went downstairs. When I returned to the room to wash my hands, Jiafeng also came in. I checked my sleeve, and the money was gone. It was only two minutes, which is shocking. Later, Xiaomei ordered the school police to investigate. Chief Zhou of the police paid close attention to Zhou Jiafeng and asked in great detail. I defended Jiafeng in every way.

February 7th I went to school to preside over the Chinese conference. I received a letter from Jiafeng, knowing that the school police had called him to the school for questioning yesterday afternoon. This matter is not good for his face, but the school police are in their duty and cannot but check from all aspects. Moreover, Jiafeng has been indecent recently and has had an affair with a female worker and had a child. Many people know about it, and people may suspect that his family is too burdened.

February 13th I fell asleep at 9:30 p.m. Between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m., a thief broke into the room and stole a new Fuji brand men's bicycle and a pair of new men's leather shoes. The thief entered through the courtyard and opened the door. It was not discovered until 6 a.m. I asked Chen Yaoqiang to report to the police, and they sent someone to investigate for a week.

February 14th Installed door and window locks. It's like locking the door after the thief has left.

February 16th Wrote to Zhou Jiafeng, approving his resignation.

### Bengbu Southern Suburbs Rong and Hu Clans Compete to Open Outdoor Gambling Dens Mobilized More Than a Hundred People to Have a Large-Scale Armed Fight

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 20th] The southern suburbs of Bengbu, Dingning'an, eighteen li away from the port, recently had disputes due to the Rong and Hu surnames competing to open outdoor gambling dens, which have been delayed for a long time and have not been resolved. By the 20th, it became more and more intense and has become worse. Both sides mobilized travelers and carried out armed fights. On that day, more than a hundred people were mobilized, and the combat weapons included rifles, red-tasseled spears, Miao knives, three-pronged steel forks, and sticks, mallets, bricks, and stones. The battlefield extended from Dingning'an city to the suburbs, reaching several miles. After the two sides came into contact, they showed their fierce flames. As a result of the fierce battle, five people from the Rong surname were injured, and three people from the Hu surname were injured. Among them, Hu Xuelun suffered the most serious injuries, with three knife wounds to the head. In the afternoon, the young men from both sides carried the injured to Bengbu on rope beds and disturbed the Feng Huai District Court Prosecutor's Office to verify the injuries. After the verification, they were sent to the hospital for treatment. Both sides saw this situation and filed lawsuits, and it is unknown how to resolve it.

[This newspaper's Wujin 22nd dispatch] Wu Mingrong, a patrolman at the Seventh Police Substation of the local train station, noticed a child in black clothes lingering near the coal pile platform around 1 a.m. on the 20th, not leaving for a long time. Upon questioning, the child stammered, appeared flustered, and tried to escape, but was apprehended. After strict interrogation at the station, the child confessed to being Zhou Changming, a 15-year-old from Danyang, who had been an apprentice at Zhang Fuxiang's ironware store on Daxilu in Zhenjiang. Last year, in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, a lame man named Liu Decai, dressed in tattered military uniform, tricked him into going to Wuxi, lodging in a shed next to the Xicheng bus station. Liu was an intelligence agent for the bandit army, and recruited the child as an assistant. Every day, the child disguised himself and went near various military organs to spy on military secrets. After writing down the secret messages, he was ordered to deliver them to liaison stations of bandits in various places. On the fifth day of the first lunar month, he came to Changzhou from Wuxi again, staying at the home of Huang Jinfa, a beggar, in a straw hut next to Dayang Bridge outside the West Gate. He had come to Changzhou four times before. He also stated that Liu Decai had taken the night train back to Wuxi.

### Ministry of Education Yesterday Issued Order to Rectify Academic Atmosphere

[This newspaper's Nanjing 23rd dispatch] The Ministry of Education, given the decline of academic atmosphere in recent years, frequent student movements, and the exploitation of opportunities by unscrupulous elements, in order to correct the declining trend and stabilize schools, so that pure young people can be guaranteed to study in peace, issued the following order on the 23rd to rectify the academic atmosphere: "In recent years, the academic atmosphere has been declining, and after the restoration, it has become even more turbulent. Student movements have been frequent in various schools, mostly incited by unscrupulous elements who seize the opportunity to confuse and mislead. The general youth are coerced and threatened by them, either striking and marching, or relying on the crowd to coerce. The requests made are not only beyond reason and scope, but also treat themselves as superior, acting like negotiators, and if they are not satisfied, they resort to insults.

The Dignity of Academic Institutions is Completely Lost

In the 35th year, students of the Nanjing Temporary University Remedial Class opposed the examination, gathered crowds to cause trouble, and beat the class director. Last year, students from various schools in Nanjing collectively petitioned, shouting for days, occupying public offices, and obstructing official business. Students from Jiaotong University and Yingshi University came to Beijing in groups, gathered at the railway station, hijacked locomotives, and cut off traffic. A portion of students in Pingjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou also brewed a nationwide strike, market strike, and labor strike movement from May 20th to June 2nd. Recently, students of Tongji University were again exploited by villains, disobeying the mayor's teachings, striking and dropping out of school, disrupting order, and insulting the mayor, almost leading to a bloody tragedy. And there have been incidents of arson and destruction in universities. The dignity of academic institutions is completely lost, and society is deeply resentful! The public opinion is deeply indignant!

The Ministry of Education, Responsible for Education, Cannot Stand Idly By

The Ministry of Education, responsible for education, cannot stand idly by. However, because the instigators in the past were only a small number of students, and we deeply know that the behind-the-scenes planning and instruction are all done by the communist bandits and their tools, most of the young people in school are coerced and passive, and we really cannot bear to severely punish them without distinguishing right from wrong. However, the country establishes schools and teaches, so as to cultivate talents. Students enter schools to study, so as to accumulate knowledge and skills. Our country has fought for eight years, and its vitality has been exhausted. After the victory, the communist bandits made trouble, and agricultural and industrial production was severely damaged, and the central finances became even more difficult. The Ministry believes that the long-term plan lies first in cultivating people. Although limited by financial resources, it has not been able to fully meet expectations in terms of restoring school buildings and expanding facilities. However, it has made every effort to focus on students' studies, enrich the school's teachers, care for poor students, and reward outstanding students.

The Country Protects and Society Cultivates

During the Anti-Japanese War, students who transferred to the rear were not only assigned to schools and given public funds; since the victory, students in the recovered areas have also been examined with leniency according to their level, so that they have the opportunity to study and be promoted. At the same time, schools have been added to accommodate young people. All these huge expenditures are taken from the hard-working people. Today, our general young people in school disregard the country's protection and society's cultivation, sacrifice their studies, work hard for a day and freeze for ten, act outside the rules, and intensify their efforts, regarding schools as inns, and using them for idleness, regarding teachers as passers-by, and not knowing love and respect. The cunning ones take pleasure in launching movements; the simple ones are willing to be held hostage by a few, gradually belonging to a special class, isolating themselves from the laws and disciplines of the country, with wrong perceptions and strange words and deeds, so that communist bandit elements can incite and exploit them, exaggerating the illusion, or directing students from School A to interfere with the freedom of School B, or first ordering one place to launch and then instigating other places to respond. If this continues, the country's painstaking efforts to cherish young people will turn into the consequence of killing young people. The Ministry's investigation has confirmed that communist bandit pawns are willing to sacrifice national education.

Earnestly Admonish, Urgently Reflect on Past Mistakes

Now that the holidays are over, we especially use earnest admonitions to awaken the self-consciousness of students in schools across the country. They must cherish themselves, encourage themselves, respect the law and discipline, abide by school rules, strive for academic excellence, make up for past mistakes, and seek progress in learning. If they still do not know how to wake up, neglect their studies, despise school rules, destroy the law and discipline, and exceed the boundaries, then the black sheep must be removed, severely punished, and there will be no leniency. The Ministry is determined to maintain and excite educational order. It has long been determined to rectify the academic atmosphere. When necessary, it will not hesitate to dissolve or suspend schools that cannot be rectified. We hope that young students across the country will urgently reflect on past mistakes, mutually admonish and encourage each other, rebuild good discipline, and live up to the country's education. This is the order!

However, dyeing factories were not optimistic about actual sales and were inactive. Local shops and firms also rarely moved. Mid-way, some firms took profits, but the market rose after falling due to strong sentiment. As a result, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Longtou and Five Blessings, rose sharply by 145,000 to 223,000 compared to Saturday. Zhongzheng rose by 300,000, and other cloths such as twill, ziggurat, fine bias bleaching cloth, and colored cloth shilin, also all rose sharply.

Adjust Yarn Prices

Another Dispatch: The Yarn Management Committee adjusted the consolidated price of cotton yarn again yesterday. The new price of 20-count yarn is 45.7 million yuan, an increase of 2.2 million compared to before, and the prices of other counts of yarn increased proportionally.

The committee continued to entrust the Textile Construction Company to open 17 kinds of yarn at the Yarn Industry Association yesterday, selling a total of 1,260 pieces, equivalent to about 2,200 pieces of 20-count yarn.

The Textile Construction Company also opened 11 kinds of yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,460 pieces, equivalent to 2,403 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were a total of 1,060 application forms.

### Commercial Arbitration Association Elects Standing Directors and Supervisors - Wang Xiaolai as Chairman

[Our Dispatch] The first joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the National Commercial Arbitration Association was held at 2:00 PM yesterday on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. More than 20 directors and supervisors attended, including Cao Peizi from the Ministry of Social Affairs, Tang Kuan from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the directors and supervisors of the association. Wang Xiaolai, Xi Wangshu, Wei Wenhan, Tao Guilin, Chen Tingrui, Zhuang Zhihuan, and Luo Beichen were publicly elected as standing directors, and Xu Jiqing, Du Yuesheng, and Qiu Liangrong were elected as standing supervisors. Wang Xiaolai was elected as chairman by mutual election. Wei Wenhan, a standing committee member, also served as secretary-general. In order to truly execute arbitration in the future, and for the execution mechanism and procedures, Li Ming, Shou Jingwei, Jiang Yiping, Shu Yunzhang, Shen Rixin, Chen Tingrui, and Wei Wenhan were specially appointed to be responsible for drafting relevant regulations.

### Improve Barter Trade - Expand Export Markets

In order to improve foreign barter trade and expand the export market for domestic goods, the Central Trust Bureau specially gathered major shipping companies and major exporters in the city to organize the China Foreign Transportation Material Consulting Committee. The first preparatory meeting will be held at the bureau at 4:00 PM on the 24th. It is heard that the shipping industry has appointed Hu Shiyuan, Shi Naiwei, Dong Haoyun, Cheng Yuzhai, and Li Zhiyi to attend and participate in the discussion.

### Grouped Exchange of Negotiable Instruments - Second Time More Progressive Than Before

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Negotiable Instruments Exchange held its second grouped direct exchange. The exchange process was more progressive than before. The negotiable instruments of the Negotiable Instruments Exchange were all delivered by 2:30 PM, and the number of errors was also reduced compared to before. A total of 193,619 negotiable instruments were exchanged in four sessions, and the total amount of exchange reached 8,953,819,012,000 yuan.

### Spring Sales of Woolen Fabrics Launched

Yesterday, Monday, the trend in the woolen fabric market was more active than last week. As the spring sales stirred, local and merchants from other places made inquiries and added to their purchases. On the standard side, most of the items exceeded the red mark. Flower tweed, Xuanwei light yellow, valencia, spring overcoat fabrics, hailisi, etc. were sturdy and marketable. The increase in factory prices was the main factor. All transactions were mostly checks at the end of this month.

### Curbing the Rising Tide of Yarn Prices: Yarn Control Committee Prohibits Southern Transport and Initiates Inspections with Local Governments

[Our Dispatch] The Yarn Control Committee, in response to the recent soaring prices of cotton yarn and cloth in the Shanghai market, despite efforts to suppress them, has been unable to quell the rising tide. While there are many reasons, the excessive amount of yarn and cloth being transported south after the removal of restrictions on southern transport, coupled with the machinations of speculators within the city, are the primary causes. In order to take effective measures, the southern transport of yarn and cloth will be temporarily suspended starting from the 24th of this month. The committee has already issued a public announcement and notified the Jianghai Customs to handle this matter. At the same time, the China Textile Corporation has been ordered to sell off large quantities of cotton yarn, and joint efforts with local governments have been initiated to inspect warehouses and yarn shops, strictly cracking down on speculators hoarding goods. Once discovered, they will be severely punished, it is said.

Furthermore, it is reported that cotton and cotton yarn prices have been soaring recently. According to authoritative figures in the cotton industry, the unreasonable rise in cotton prices is due to the fact that last year, U.S. cotton production increased by three million bales, or more than 12.2 million dan (a unit of weight), an increase of over 30% compared to 1946. China's cotton production also increased by two million dan. India's cotton production remained unchanged. The global cotton production is higher than in previous years.

Although China's cotton production is hampered by inconvenient transportation, the main cotton-producing areas, such as Shashi, Hankou, and the vicinity of Dongting Lake, have no transportation difficulties. Currently, the China Textile Corporation and the Agricultural Bank are purchasing cotton on behalf of others, with very good results. In previous years, purchasing usually stopped before the Lunar New Year's Lantern Festival, but this year, it has been intensified, so the amount purchased in various places is quite considerable.

Of the US$500 million in U.S. aid to China loans, it is stipulated that US$170 million be used to purchase U.S. cotton. Based on current prices, this will purchase 3 million dan. Once all of this is imported, China's cotton supply will definitely be more than sufficient, so there is no reason for cotton prices to rise. Furthermore, the sharp rise in cotton yarn prices yesterday saw 20-count Double Horse brand cotton yarn reach over 62 million yuan, exceeding the actual production cost. The responsible authorities are actively planning effective countermeasures, it is said.

Academic Studies

### A Supplementary Explanation of Zhu Xi's "Investigating Things" and "Extending Knowledge" in the Great Learning

— Yan Qun

Zhu Xi, in his commentary on the Great Learning, divided it into "Classic" and "Commentary." Because there was no commentary on the "Investigating Things and Extending Knowledge" in the "Classic," he adopted Cheng Yi's idea and supplemented it, saying: "The so-called extending knowledge lies in investigating things, meaning that to extend our knowledge, we must investigate things and exhaust their principles. For the spirit of the human mind is inherently capable of knowing, and the things under heaven are inherently endowed with principles; only because principles have not been exhausted, knowledge is not complete. Therefore, the Great Learning begins by teaching students to investigate all things under heaven, making use of their existing knowledge of principles to further exhaust them, seeking to reach their ultimate limit. After diligent effort over time, one will suddenly achieve complete understanding, reaching all the exterior, interior, essence and refinement of all things, and one's mind will be entirely clear and its vast utility will be fully understood. This is called investigating things, this is called the culmination of knowledge."

I have always believed that Zhu Xi's supplementary commentary, though not even a few hundred words, contains the seeds of knowledge formation, its subjective and objective conditions. It is truly enlightening when compared to modern Western philosophers' theories of knowledge. His theory of "investigating things to exhaust principles" is particularly in line with the spirit of science. It is a pity that later scholars' understanding was shallow and they could not carry it forward. Regardless of my own lack of knowledge and insight, I offer this explanation of Zhu Xi's intent for the benefit of scholars.

"The spirit of the human mind is inherently capable of knowing." This "knowing" can be explained as follows: the senses receive things and create sensations, which reach the mind and become awareness and knowledge. This ability to be aware and know constantly exists in the mind, responding to sensations and becoming awareness and knowledge. The Mohist Canon says: "Knowledge is the material. Knowledge is that by which one knows; but it does not necessarily know. Like light." "Knowledge is the material" refers to the inherent ability to know. Without contact with things, the material for knowledge has no way to be used, and the basis for knowing may not necessarily know. For example, the eye may have sight, but if it does not see, it cannot be said to see. Our mind already has the material for knowing. As for what is known, it is nothing more than the principles of things. When things come into contact with our mind, there is no other way but through principles. Therefore, to extend our mind's knowledge, we must investigate things and exhaust their principles. If principles are not exhausted, knowledge is incomplete. Furthermore, when the material for knowledge is applied to things, grasping their principles to form knowledge, there are also tools that do not need to be sought externally, but are inherent in our mind, such as the laws of thought in logic, and axioms in mathematics… These are examples. Now, when we say "investigate all things under heaven, making use of their existing knowledge of principles to further exhaust them," the principles that are already known initially are inherent in our mind and do not need to be sought externally. Using these as a basis, we then seek what is unknown, and then what was unknown becomes known, and we further exhaust what is unknown, gradually reaching its ultimate limit. The so-called "suddenly achieving complete understanding" means that when many principles have been exhausted, the effect of convergence and understanding is achieved, and what is converged becomes a common principle and general rule. Its use lies in using the past to know the future, and seeking the effect based on the cause. All of this is the work of induction and deduction in logic. When our mind first uses its inherent knowledge on things, this is the work of deduction. Then, investigating things to exhaust their principles, until sudden complete understanding, is the work of induction. Finally, holding on to the common principles and general rules obtained through complete understanding to deal with changes and predict the unforeseen, is again the work of deduction. It is fitting that "all the exterior, interior, essence and refinement of all things will be reached, and one's mind will be entirely clear and its vast utility will be fully understood."

### Manhan on Pragmatism

— Translated by Chen Zhuoru

I believe the positive significance of pragmatism lies in removing the abstract barrier between thought and action. In a sense, this is an important step towards a new era of planning – a new kind of thought which is interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Pragmatism appreciates that every thought is essentially an organic part of action, and therefore opposes the old view held by some philosophers that pure theory has nothing to do with practical action. Except for someone locked in a monastery, thought should not be regarded as mere contemplation, that is, thought should not be merely for the sake of thought, but should be a tool for life or action. In real life, there is no thought that does not have a direct connection with action. To ignore or deny this consistency between thought and action is to deny that thought is essentially determined by the environment. From a scientific point of view, it is beneficial and harmless to reaffirm the creativity of action. It should be understood that only a new action can produce a new thought. This spirit has already borne fruit in education, because we can see that education now relies not on abstract preaching, but on a new educational technology. This method involves arranging the environment so that children can put the principles they learn into practice. Pure reliance on persuasion and rebuke has been abandoned.

The advantage of pragmatism lies in breaking down the abstraction that separates thought from action. However, pragmatism in its current form also has its shortcomings. This is that it limits the scope of action too narrowly. We cannot limit action to trivial actions in daily life, nor can we focus on a small circle of individuals and their immediate interests. This narrow interpretation limits thought to the stage of chance invention. In this situation, most are still unconscious adaptations – all for the sake of immediate survival. At this stage, thought is merely an unimportant supporting role, because it has no creative power. Thought only fills gaps in occasional, fragmented inspirations, and the skill of thought is no more than the significance of accidental discoveries in trial and error. If thought is to be able to project into the future, it must first deconstruct concrete things into abstract units in the image, and then recombine them in order to achieve the expected goal. This kind of thought is different from the accidental discoveries of the moment, and it is intentional invention. In short, this stage proves that abstract thinking originates from an activity higher than accidental discovery – the historical stage of inventing thought.

When thought transitions from the stage of unintentional discovery to the stage of intentional invention, the connection between thought and action cannot be directly grasped. This is why some idealist philosophers believe that thought has nothing to do with practical needs. At this stage, we can say that the idea comes before the action, and can direct the action. The typical example is: the idea of a house existed in the architect's mind long before the house existed in the outside world.

If we view thought in this way, it is easy to misunderstand that thought is independent of experience. In the stage of intentional invention, we cannot deny some of the abstractness of thought, just as we cannot completely agree that thought is irrelevant to the background of concrete activities. Although thought at this stage can transcend immediate needs, it is still not an absolute thing that is done for no reason.

The solution to the problem lies in recognizing that the background of intentionally invented thought is not completely limited to the scope of personal activity. Therefore, we can say that thought is absolute, meaning that it has little to do with personal activity. However, intentionally invented thought is still related to action in a broad sense. We should understand this point if we pay attention to how thought and action are intricately related in the entire historical group. Therefore, the practicality of thought at this stage cannot be seen solely from personal actions, but if we pay attention to the actions of the group to which that person belongs, the practicality of thought becomes apparent. Even the transition from unintentional discovery to intentional invention cannot be entirely attributed to individual achievements, but should be attributed to the entire adaptation of society, from the original, less specialized form of production (such as the primitive era of gathering and hunting) to more complex forms of specialization. Because of the progress of the division of labor in work and social functions, systems or things that were previously regarded as complete examples are now fragmented, because everyone only sees his part of the group work. Abstraction is not necessarily determined by external objects, but by the nature of the thinker's activities, especially by the organization of the group to which the individual belongs. Therefore, thought refers to "group thought." The broader the scope of activity, the finer the division of labor, and the more people who can view the same thing from different perspectives, the more necessary it is to clarify the matter. Socialized people have to avoid adopting individual and different views of systems and processes, and have to invent an abstract view that can be adopted by the entire society. Therefore, there may be many forms of abstraction, just as there are many ways for a social collective to solve problems. Therefore, the division of labor in work and social functions creates more viewpoints in a community than one person can need alone, so he can learn more than he actually needs. Society accumulates a large amount of experience and abstraction through language and concepts, in proportion to the amount of methods that have been commonly used in history. This can explain why a person is stunned by a large amount of available abstractions and feels that these categories and processes of thought are innate; methodologically speaking, this is equivalent to believing that his concepts and perceptions come from another world. In practice, the existing ideas (and vocabulary) can never go beyond the scope of the society in which he lives. Therefore, the illusion that thought in the invention stage has nothing to do with action is due to the fact that in a highly stratified and highly specialized society, the collective viewpoint can no longer be seen. The reason why he can maintain his intellectual detachment is because he cannot see how his personal experience is related to the social experience. In the stage of intentional invention, the pragmatist explanation can still be applied to the entire society, but not to individuals – at least not so directly.

### Writings of American Philosophers During the War

— Xie Youwei

During this Great War, American philosophers were quite active, as the author has reported in a previous article (this journal, issue 10). What I want to report now is the writings of American philosophers during the war. During the war, American philosophers continued to work hard at writing. First, looking at the various philosophical periodicals published by American philosophers, they not only did not stop during the war, but increased, and were even more lively than before the war. The longer-running philosophical journals, such as the "Philosophical Review," only slightly reduced some of their content, and continued to be published as usual. The "Journal of Philosophy" continued to publish with a length of 730 pages per year. Other journals, such as "Ethics," "Philosophy of Science," "Journal of Symbolic Logic," and "Journal of Social Philosophy" all continued to be published. In addition, the following new philosophical journals were added during the war: "Philosophic Abstracts" (published in 1939), "Philosophy and Phenomenological Research" (published in 1940), "Journal of the History of Ideas" (published in 1940), "Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism" (published in 1941), "Journal of Legal and Political Philosophy" (published in 1942), "Philosophical Forum" (published in 1943), and "Latin-American Thought" (published in 1945). With the exception of the last one, these new publications are still continuing to this day. The articles in these various publications rarely relate directly to the war, but there are particularly many articles related to social philosophy, democratic politics, freedom, and the philosophy of history.

Secondly, and most importantly, is the specialized writing of American philosophers during the war. During the war, American philosophers, on the one hand, had to participate in the war, and on the other hand, continued their specialized research without stopping. Judging from the various specialized works published during the war, their specialized research did not seem to be greatly affected by the war. Below, I will briefly introduce their specialized writings published during the war separately.

We should first mention that American philosophers published a "Library of Living Philosophers" during the war, edited by P.A. Schilpp of Northwestern University. Five books have been published in this series: one on the philosophy of Dewey, one on the philosophy of Santayana, one on the philosophy of Whitehead, one on the philosophy of Moore, and one on the philosophy of Russell. Each book contains the autobiography of the philosopher, discussions or criticisms, about twenty philosophical essays by the philosopher, the philosopher's own responses, and a complete bibliography of the philosopher's works. If we want to understand the philosophy of famous modern philosophers, the above five books are the most authoritative writings.

The next thing to mention is the research of American philosophers on classical philosophy. American philosophers also seem to have made progress in this area of research. Regarding the research on Plato, the books published during the war include R. Demos' "The Philosophy of Plato" (published in 1939), which systematically explains Plato's philosophy. Next, there is G.R. Morrow's "Plato's Law of Slavery" (published in 1939) and A.D. Winspear's "The Genesis of Plato's Thought" (published in 1940), both of which discuss Plato's thought from a social and economic perspective. In addition, Richard Robinson's "Plato's Earlier Dialectic" and Frederick Solmsen's "Plato's Theology" are also worth noting. Regarding the research on Aristotle, H. Cherniss published two books: one is Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy (Volume 1, published in 1944), and the other is The Riddle of the Early Academy (published in 1945). Philosophers after Greece are relatively neglected, and there are few works worth mentioning. However, the research on 19th-century philosophy in the United States is very lively. During this period, there were two philosophical eccentrics in Europe, one was Kierkegaard and the other was Nietzsche. Before the war, almost none of the former's works had been translated into English, but during the war, most of his works were translated by American philosophers. His thought has gradually attracted the attention of American philosophers. The latter, although a philosopher well-known in the United States, his thought was also a subject of renewed research by American philosophers during the war. C. Brinton has a book "Nietasche" (published in 1941), which specifically discusses the connection between Nazi propaganda and Nietzsche's thought. G.A. Morgan's book "What Nietzsche Means" (published in 1941) is more objective and more sympathetic to Nietzsche's thought. In addition, American philosophers are more interested in the research on American indigenous philosophy than before the war. For example, W.H. Sheldon wrote a book "America's Progressive Philosophy" (1942), T.V. Smitb wrote a book "The Philosophic Way of Life in America" (1943), and H.M. Jones edited a book "Ideas in America" (1944), all of which are helpful books for understanding American philosophy.

Finally, in the main body of philosophy, such as logic, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics, American philosophers also have some representative works worth mentioning. In the field of logic, there are C.C. Pratt's "The Logic of Modern Psychology" (1939), W.V. Quine's "Mathematical Logic" (1940), M.R. Cohen's "A.Preface to Logic" (1944), and R. Carnap's "Studies in Semantics vol. I" (1942), "vol. II" (1943). In the field of epistemology, there are Brand Blanshard's "The Nature of Thought" (1939) and L. Wood's "Analysis of Knowledge" (1941), the former starts from an idealist standpoint and the latter starts from a realist standpoint. Both are analytical in spirit and of great value. In the field of metaphysics, there is J. Maritain's "A.Preface to Metaphysics" (1939), which explains the viewpoints of medieval scholasticism. A.N. Whitehead's "Modes of Thouglit" (1939) has a thorough discussion of the close relationship between life and nature. In addition, W.T. Stace's "The Nature of the World" (1940) and D.H. Parker's "Exerience and Substance" (1941) are both from different perspectives to put forward their panpsychistic systems. In the field of ethics, the most noteworthy is C.L. Steuenson's "Ethics and Language" (1944), because it discusses moral concepts from the analysis of the meaning of language. John Dewey's "Valuation Theory" and B.E. Jessup's "Relational Value Meani" are not to be ignored. In the field of aesthetics, there is "History ofsm, 1949)", co-authored by K.E. Gibert and H. Kuhn. The former is the most complete history of aesthetics.

American philosophers also have commendable works in other departments such as social philosophy, political philosophy, and philosophy of history, but due to space limitations, they cannot all be described in detail. In short, the writings of American philosophers during the war, whether in terms of quality or quantity, have made progress.

### The Form and Essence of Objects

— Wei Yuwen

A Précis of Bosanquet's Aesthetics, Part 4

Aesthetic feeling is tied to, or related to, the aesthetic object, especially the form of the object. The aesthetic mind, with respect to its object, seems not to value its essence, but rather appreciates its form. For example, with music, it does not care whether the sound originates from nature or an orchestra; it focuses on the melody. In relation to sound, melody emphasizes the form of the sound. Regarding sculpture and painting, it is not concerned with the wood, stone, paper, or ink itself, but rather with their expression, or the form of their expression. But what is form? What is the relationship between form and essence?

The most basic and shallow form of an object is its spatial outline or shape. Furthermore, general rules such as grammar, syntax, and the rhythm and format of poetry are also within the scope of form. This type of form is superficial, schematic, empty, pure, and contrary to the root or essence of the object, and to its so-called essential, true content. This form contains an implication of hypocrisy. For example, insincere etiquette is referred to as being merely a formality. This form appears to be unrelated to its content, as different materials seem to be able to express the same form. With this type of form, the form of the object is not the essence of the object; form and essence are different.

But can form truly be unaffected by its material, or not affect its material, and be completely different from essence? Can different materials truly express an entirely identical form? For example, can a bronze statue and a plaster statue perfectly represent the same person's posture? The truth is clearly not so. At the same time, we all know that different languages each have their own different forms, and the difficulty of translating poetry lies here. This proves that different materials cannot express perfectly identical forms. Furthermore, from another perspective, the same deep color, when expressed in different materials, appears as different forms of color, such as when expressed in a piece of coarse cloth and a piece of fine wool. The same deep shade of red in a sunflower and in a rose is different; two faces with similar outlines but different learning and cultivation are also different. This indicates that form changes along with its material. Thus, we know that material can affect form, and that form and essence have a close relationship. At the same time, we know that behind that superficial form, which is seemingly the opposite of essence, there is a more fundamental, deeper form that essence originally possesses. Or, to put it another way, each type of material has its own unique form. Such as clay, copper, stone, paint, color, silk and bamboo instruments, and language each has its unique form. Their form is their structure or the connection between their parts. This structure and connection determine how the aesthetic person or artist handles these materials or gives them a more refined style. This means that the form of the essence determines the artificial form. But it is this form that transforms the different parts into a unified organism, turning dull and tasteless materials into an object that is full of interest, endless meaning, and vibrant life. Therefore, form can also affect material. Form makes an individual what it is; in other words, it makes an object what it is. But what makes an individual what it is, is the essence or soul of that individual. Thus, form is essence. The form of essence can be expressed as movement, can be expressed as life, can be expressed as myriad changes and hierarchies, and can reveal profound meaning. Therefore, the spatial outline and shape are only its most superficial layer. Form and essence are inseparable aspects of an object. So-called empty form and absolute material are both the result of abstraction and have no relation to real truth.

But form and essence are ultimately different. Their difference is like the difference between the soul and the body. You cannot transform either aspect into the other, and both aspects seem to have their own reality, so they are not the same. But neither aspect has a separate, independent reality; when combined, they are completely beautiful, and when separated, they are both harmed, so they are not different. Not the same, not different – this is precisely the relationship between form and essence.

### Forbidden Talk in Academia (10)

— Zhang Qiyun

Irving Babbitt on Eastern and Western Culture

The late Harvard University professor Irving Babbitt (1865-1933) was a master of the New Humanism. Many famous professors in China were his students, and the essence of his theories has been introduced repeatedly. In Babbitt's view, the world should be regarded as a single unit, and history should be a record of all of humanity. Confucius, Buddha, Jesus, and Aristotle are of equal importance. The United States, located between Europe and the Far East, should become a bridge for communication between Eastern and Western cultures, and should not erect barriers between the East and the West. He hoped that Americans would possess the fortitude of the British nation, while removing its insular arrogance. In terms of attitude, Americans should adopt the advantages of the two great nations of China and France.

Babbitt believed that the true center of Western culture was Paris, France. He felt particularly delighted by the academic atmosphere of Paris, and once said that if a student could master French, the benefits gained at the University of Paris might exceed what could be obtained at Oxford University. Babbitt studied in France in his early years, and in 1923 he returned to France as a visiting professor at the University of Paris, where he gave lectures; one course, taught in English, was titled "British Romantic Poets," and the other, taught in French, was titled "Rousseau." His profound knowledge of French was praised by scholars, and some said that his reputation in France might be even higher than in the United States. Babbitt opposed the Rousseau-led Romanticism of France, and he did not approve of the Naturalism of the Victorian era in England. The former placed too much emphasis on emotional effects, while the latter placed too much emphasis on mechanical effects; both extremes were common ailments of modern culture. Babbitt believed that the World War was a natural result of the bad ideas that had been accumulating since the 19th century. The Humanism he advocated was aimed at remedying these shortcomings. Humanism originated in Greek culture and was tacitly in agreement with the doctrines of Chinese Confucianism. Since the Renaissance, many scholars in Europe have devoted themselves to this field. However, modern humanists must understand the methods and spirit of science and keep pace with the times, hence the name "Scientific New Humanism."

Babbitt was proficient in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and Pali. He preferred Buddhism to Christianity and left behind an English translation of the Pali Buddhist classic (Dhammapada). However, he regretted that he had not learned Chinese. In 1900, he married Rosa Drew in London. Babbitt never visited China, but his wife was born in China and had lived there for many years. However, Babbitt believed that he understood China to a degree that his wife could not. His wife felt unconvinced, believing that since her husband had never traveled to China to observe it firsthand, how could he truly know China? Babbitt believed that understanding people lies in understanding their hearts, and that the same is true for a nation or a country; relying solely on sensory perception is not enough to deeply understand their people. His wife finally agreed with him.

After the age of forty, Babbitt's reputation gradually grew, and talented students from home and abroad flocked to him, which was one of the joys of his life. Among the Chinese scholars who studied under Babbitt, Mr. Mei Disheng of Xuancheng was the first. When Mr. Mei first arrived in Cambridge, Babbitt was only fifty years old and full of energy. He talked about philosophy and religion with Eastern students more than he talked about literature. Babbitt felt a sense of kinship with Confucius's doctrines and was also aware of the shortcomings of traditional Chinese culture. Several Chinese landscape paintings hung in Babbitt's study, all of which were gifts from Chinese students. Babbitt believed that what the paintings represented was not just the scenery, but a kind of natural and unconstrained spirit, which made him feel extremely happy at heart. Babbitt deeply regretted the decline of Confucianism and expressed his earnest expectations to his Chinese disciples, believing that the revival of the Chinese nation was related not only to China itself.

(The author also has an article titled "Babbitt – A Teacher of One Generation," published in the 46th issue of "Thought and Time," a memorial issue for Mr. Mei Disheng.)

Chinese philosophy is built on eating. "The state takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven." These are the words of politicians. "Food and sex are human nature," and "Empty the mind and fill the belly." These are the words of pure philosophers. "When the granaries are full, people know propriety and righteousness; when clothing and food are sufficient, they know honor and shame." This is yet another saying. In short, without food, everything is troublesome; with food, everything is solved. Our ancient sages have long recognized this, which is another perspective compared to the West's sole pursuit of civil rights. Therefore, society refers to occupations as "rice bowls," and because of their varying quality, there are gold, iron, and broken rice bowls. Those with jobs call themselves "scrambling for food," as if eating is the ultimate goal, and everything else is irrelevant.

The impact of eating primarily manifests in material enjoyment, which is almost entirely concentrated on eating. As the saying goes, "Wearing is for the wind, eating is for enjoyment." While wind is good, it is ultimately not as good as enjoyment. Therefore, moralists encourage people by saying, "If one can chew on vegetable roots, everything can be done" as a standard for self-cultivation. – They completely fail to consider that today's refugees regard even rotten vegetable leaves as treasures, but these poor wretches are only destined to suffer, and they have no chance to do anything! – Conversely, when officials and nobles have excessive amounts of money, the easiest way to display wealth is through eating. I once read "Spring Ice Studio Field Notes" by Li Yuerui, which includes a section on the extravagance of river officials, which is almost entirely focused on food. For example, ducks are chased on red-hot brick floors just to eat their webbed feet, dozens of pigs are slaughtered just to eat their tenderloin, and even more strange is the world-famous monkey brain eating. "Brain-filled and fat-bellied" monkeys are dressed in red clothes, their heads are shaved, and they are placed under square tables with holes. A hammer strikes, opening their skulls, and guests each use pre-placed silver spoons to scoop up the fresh brain matter to eat. Amazingly, some people can actually do it and eat it! Furthermore, Cantonese people eat snakes and civets, glorifying it as a "dragon-tiger fight," and Fujianese people (or Cantonese people) eat small mice that have been fed with honey. When Alexander Vertinsky heard about these things, they were laughing matters. Moreover, even among all the savage tribes in the world, these eating methods and objects are sufficient to rank at the top without shame! Foreigners eat for nutrition and for energy for work, but Chinese people do not pay much attention to this. Wealthy old men and women may take tonics, or young masters and young ladies may take yin-nourishing and yang-strengthening supplements, but that is beyond nutrition and energy and is regarded as medicine, not food. After the war in Britain, even if you were a minister, you would only be rationed one egg and four or five pounds of bread per week, and meat and fat were even more limited. Although they also suffered terribly, they still endured and persevered. If it were in China, there would be chaos. When Bertrand Russell traveled to China in the past, the Hunan warlord held a banquet that lasted from noon until three or four in the afternoon, and the dishes were still not finished. Russell had already eaten so much that he could not eat anymore and had to say that he was finished. The Chinese officials all laughed at him for being unsophisticated. It is said that the Manchu Han Imperial Feast of the Qing Dynasty had 120 dishes. Even if you ate one dish per minute, it would still take two hours to finish. What's more, there was also drinking and gambling? The ancients had already said the words "strength for a long meal," and when Wang Mang became emperor, according to Kang Youwei's "New Learning Forgery Classic," Liu Xin and others specially forged the "Zhou Li" to cater to this ambitious scholar, saying that the Duke of Zhou stipulated that the emperor's meal should have 120 dishes, and that 120 jars of welcoming gifts were needed, and that the emperor's three consorts, nine concubines, twenty-seven wives, and eighty-one imperial spouses were also exactly 120 wives. Perhaps the full feast of later generations originated from this? If this is true, then the history of eating in our country is also long, long ago.

Secondly, there are all kinds of cultural forms derived from eating, such as cookbooks and food manuals that discuss eating, drinking games and wine policies that discuss wine, and books of etiquette and sacrificial rites that discuss etiquette – people love to eat, and gods and ghosts also love to eat. The oracle bone inscriptions record that the special sacrifices to the deceased mother killed up to 300 cattle. Isn't it shocking? The ancients said that when a country was destroyed, they would only say that "the ancestors did not receive blood sacrifices," as if even though people were dead, the problem of eating still existed and was very serious. The character "sacrifice" itself means holding meat to offer to the gods, which is even clearer. Foreigners offer flowers to the dead, but China does not do this. – Even the stories and jokes that arise from food and drink occupy an important position in past publications. Someone flattered Chinese culture as a culture of eating. A plate of chop suey has already made foreign steaks retreat in fear. If we were to bring out our full set of skills in frying, stir-frying, stewing, boiling… wouldn't we make the foreign sons eat their sores? Moreover, Chinese cooking is very abstract. Unlike foreigners who specify how many grams of salt and pepper to use, our "Yi Ya skills" rely entirely on the experience of the old stewards, looking at the heat and looking at the color. The same shark fin, cooked by someone who has worked as a cook for the late Dean Tan, is different from the others. Old restaurants must have a few signature dishes that others cannot imitate, and old diners must be able to pick out or instruct on the various vegetables. Didn't the Guangheju in Beijing used to have the sayings "Pan Fish" and "Jiang Tofu"? To this day, the restaurants on West Chang'an Street in Beijing all have something called "Mr. Ma's Soup," which is said to have been instructed by Ma Xulun. I don't know if this is true? In short, the Eastern spiritual civilization should not only be expressed in words and thoughts, but also in food and drink. Therefore, even if you follow the Suiyuan Food List to cook various side dishes, I am afraid that the result will be a failure.

### Honest Advertisement

— Mao Yi

Commercial advertising is generally perceived as "boasting and exaggeration," and there is indeed no shortage of merchants who hold this attitude when doing such advertising.

"Today's tomatoes are too ripe. It is best to come back tomorrow to buy them." – Do you believe this is a sentence from an advertisement? In fact, it is, and it is an advertisement made by the "Farmer's Market" in Hollywood.

Earl Wright Burke, the advertising director of the "Farmer's Market," has adhered to the principle of "telling the truth" since the market opened in 1934. His honesty has created prosperity for the market.

A large film company, admiring Burke's name, hired him at a high price several years ago. As soon as he took office, his new boss called him in and asked him how he planned to do things.

"I'm going to tell the truth," Burke said. "If one of our films is terribly bad, I'll say, 'Ladies and gentlemen, you'd better stay home tonight and listen to the radio.' If one of our films is good, I'll advise them to take the shortcut to the local theater to see it."

The boss was shocked and showed an embarrassed look that said "find someone better." The next day, Burke happily returned to his old home, reunited with vegetables and his old customers.

Salesmen like Burke are not unique in the United States. Here are some simple examples:

John Wanamaker in New York once advertised: "We have a batch of worthless raincoats, now selling for $1.49 each." However, the next day, all the raincoats were sold out.

A lampshade merchant advertised to promote lampshades that cost one dollar each: "Of course, these lampshades are not as durable as those made of expensive parchment. If they are too close to the light bulb, the paper on the shade may turn black. They will probably last for one or two summers."

Saks Fifth Avenue in New York said: "We paid too much, we bought too much. Frankly, we are having cash flow problems." Below this was: "Three-piece spring mattress sets for sale. Comfortable, but difficult to move. Let go for $140, which can help to improve its appearance."

Merchants who publish this type of advertisement directly establish credibility, so when they offer something worth buying, people trust them deeply. They are also usually able to sell the goods they disparage – if the price is indeed low.

### New Year Customs in Taiwan

— Yinxiang

The folk customs of Taiwan are similar to those of other provinces. They also celebrate the Lunar New Year very lively, and the first three days of the first month also follow the old customs.

The first day of the first month is a good day for family reunions, and everyone spends it at home. A married daughter is not allowed to return to her parents' home on that day, otherwise she would be hoping for her parents' family to be poor.

The custom of New Year greetings is to be held on the second day. The climate in Taiwan is very warm, like early summer in all seasons, without winter cold, so the preserved vegetables will spoil if they are left out for more than three days, so it is stipulated that the second day is the day for feasting. If there is a new bride, she must accompany her new groom back to her parents' home on that day. According to custom, the bride's parents should send someone with some gifts to the groom's home, indicating that they are inviting the bride to play at her parents' home, and the groom will buy some return gifts to take with him. The bride dresses up beautifully on this day and returns to her parents' home, first congratulating her parents and saying many auspicious words. At that time, the mother's joy is indescribable, and she takes out rice cakes and many things that her daughter likes to give her to eat. The bride can eat and chew heartily, drink spring wine with her sisters, and have fun, telling each other everything about her husband's family. Some even go shopping or play cards or watch a play together after drinking. The parents-in-law watch the son-in-law with smiling eyes, and the uncles and aunts can make fun of the new son-in-law. All families celebrate this second day in the same lively way, until it is dark, the new couple return to the husband's home. This day is also commonly known as "Double Return."

The second day of the Lunar New Year is the liveliest of the three days, and everyone celebrates wildly. The streets are full of women dressed in red and green. The business of cars and rickshaws is particularly good on this day.

The third day, however, is particularly taboo. Folk customs call it "Red Dog Day," which is a very unlucky day. No major events take place, and no one goes out to avoid bumping into any stars. (Lunar New Year in Taipei)

### Automatic Price Reduction

— Yan Ping

In recent years, all that has been heard is a series of price increases and adjustments, so hearing a "no price increase" is occasionally exciting, and if you encounter a truly "big price reduction," you would definitely find it surprising instead.

Tuition fees have already been stipulated by the authorities. However, there are still a few private schools that think it is too low and not enough to cover expenses, so the Bureau of Education, in order to prevent excessive charging and exceeding the standards, Director Li has decided to personally investigate in order to prevent abuses. Who knew that in this situation of preventing exceeding the standards, there would be a discovery of "sudden price drops"!

The situation in Nanshi is indeed not comparable to that in Beishi. Just in the area near Beishi's Xiaoshijie, private elementary schools are too numerous to count. The fees have always been lower than stipulated, and this time the situation is even more unexpected. The stipulated fee for private elementary schools is two million yuan, but on the posters in the Nanshi area, the fees charged by each school are often less than half of the stipulated amount, or even only a quarter of the stipulated amount!

This situation is, of course, welcomed by most parents. But the sudden price drop in the midst of price increases has aroused research value.

The expenses of the schools in Nanshi are, of course, slightly lower than those in Beishi, but they cannot be reduced by half or a quarter. Teachers in both the north and south cities need the same minimum standard of living.

So, how can there be a phenomenon of sudden and sharp price reductions? According to the school authorities, it is to take into account the situation of the families, to reduce the fees to the possible range of parental burden, so as to avoid a sharp increase in the number of out-of-school children. Some of these schools have boards of directors, or various associations and trade unions, bearing the recurring expenses, which are originally semi-obligatory in nature, so reducing the fees does not affect the teachers' salaries.

These schools' "automatic price reductions" have given the bosses of general academic shops a warning! It is hoped that schools that are founded for education can be influenced by each other!

### The Spring Breeze Remains

— Shi Yu

I have not celebrated the Lunar New Year for several years. The Lunar New Year has been abolished, so it seems unnecessary to celebrate it happily. But looking at the enthusiastic appearance of others, I can't help but feel puzzled. This time, I rushed back to Shanghai from Nanjing, looking askance at the Lunar New Year with one eye, and I can still see the spring breeze.

I watched the large crowds of people lining up in Xiaguan in long queues. Due to the large number of travelers returning home for the New Year, tickets are even harder to buy, and a few anxious people began to riot. The police grabbed their collars, and one of them explained to the police officer in panic: "I want to go home for the New Year!" The travelers almost all carried oiled chickens or pressed ducks. A sister-like figure was instructing her younger brother: "Tell mother that although I can't go home for the New Year, I still want the New Year's money. You have to save it for me!" After the train passed Danyang, many of the passengers had fallen asleep. I admired the various postures of dozing and guessed their sweet dreams.

Thanks to my appetite, I ate four New Year's dinners, three were full banquets, and one was at a slightly poorer friend's house. Although the occasions were different, the mood for eating New Year's dinner was the same. Whether it was at a wealthy family's house or a poor friend's house, this meal was the warmest of the year for them. Children can boldly gobble it down, and no longer have to pay attention to the adults' eyes; the wife puts the chicken leg on her husband's bowl: "Why are you so polite!" The father kept shouting to his children: "Please! Please!" As if they were not eating together every day.

Under the current circumstances, the Lunar New Year is still the warmest festival for most people. The New Year's bonus and dividends make people's pockets feel heavy; those who owe debts also feel lighter on their shoulders because the last month of the year has passed. I saw those who work hard all year round get warmth in the New Year. Entertainment venues are crowded with people who rarely go there once a year. I declined two friends' invitations to watch a movie in the New Year, and I said in a reproachful tone; "Do you want to steal their warmth?" Trucks beating New Year's drums are speeding on the road, firecrackers are flying around the ears, and the sound of dice is ringing in the doors…

The Lunar New Year has been abolished, but the spring breeze remains!

### Hometown of Xiang Yu

— Bai

I recently read Ke Manjun's article "Visiting the Hometown of Xiang Yu" in the Free Talk section of the February 19th Shen Bao. It said that Xiangli was in "southwest Vietnam," which is quite different from what the author had visited. I will only describe what I know, as follows:

According to the "Biography of Xiang Yu," Xiang Wang was a native of Xiaxiang, and "Xiaxiang" is explained in the dictionary as present-day Suqian County, Jiangsu Province. Suqian is a place that the author had visited in the past, so I know it well. "Xiang Wang's Hometown" is located about a mile outside the south gate of Suqian. Before the war, it was opened as Xiangli Park, with an attached Xiangli Elementary School. In a tiled house, there was a huge stele with the four large characters "Xiang Wang's Hometown" written on it. An old locust tree stood tall beside it. The elders said that it was planted by the king himself. There were many inscriptions in the park, such as those by Zhang Zhijiang, Lai Lian, Wu Mai, and Yi Junzu. The author still remembers that Yi Junzu also had the line "The Chu traveler bids farewell to the overlord on a long journey, and the grass and trees in Suqian are all fragrant."

Inside the south gate of Suqian there was also a Xiang Wang Temple, which was converted into Xiang Wang Temple Elementary School before the war. It was adjacent to the Provincial Senior Glass Vocational School (Suqian is a famous glass producing area). The temple enshrined statues of Xiang Wang and Consort Yu, sitting side by side. Mei Lanfang's performance of the play "Farewell My Concubine" was very popular at one time. At that time, in order to make it more realistic, someone was sent to take photos, but the statues of the king were refined and gentle. Although they were not as beautiful as a woman, as Zhang Liang was praised by Sima Qian, they were not as fierce as the later legends said. The play was not put on stage, and Jin Shaoshan was finally chosen to play the role of "Overlord."

Furthermore, Consort Yu was from Yugou Cliff in Shuyang, a neighboring town of Suqian. Therefore, the people of Suqian often jokingly said that they and the people of Shuyang were related, which is to jokingly trace this marriage. (Recompense)

### European Royal Troubles

— Yang Shi

Almost all of the few remaining royal families in Europe are facing the same problem: more princesses than princes, and some simply have no male heirs to the throne.

As everyone knows, the British royal family has only two princesses, and Princess Elizabeth recently married Captain Mountbatten. Princess Juliana, the heir to the Dutch throne, recently gave birth to her fourth daughter, meaning that no male has sat on the throne since 1884. Even worse is Denmark, where Prince Frederick has only three daughters, and according to Danish law, princesses cannot inherit the throne. Only after April 1946 did the Swedish royal family find some comfort when King Adolf finally had a son after having four princesses. Similarly, Prince Olaf of Norway had a large number of daughters before finally having a precious son, who is now only nine years old. Romania is even more tragic. King Michael has always been a widower, and only when attending Princess Elizabeth's wedding was he moved by the beauty of Princess Anne of Denmark. However, the members of Parliament did not facilitate this union, and did not agree to the marriage. Michael was forced to abandon the throne and is scheduled to marry Princess Anne in May, thus ending this pitiful dynasty. King George of Greece has divorced the Queen and has no intention of remarrying, so there is no talk of a crown prince. The Belgian royal family has lost its center, and the country is still being governed by a regent.

In addition to the fact that many of the heirs to the throne are female, the more serious problem is that it is almost too difficult for so many princesses to find husbands of equal status, because their husbands must be princes or dukes from other royal families. Only God knows how this problem will be solved in the future.

### Washington's Motto

— Wu Jiu

Here are Washington's mottos written by himself in his youth:

Do not rejoice when others encounter misfortune, even if the person who encounters misfortune is your enemy, you should not gloat. Do not lightly believe when you hear words that slander others.

In clothing, strive for simplicity and avoid being unconventional.

If you cherish your reputation, you should associate with people of noble character. It is better to be lonely than to be friends with bad people.

Do not easily promise others what you can do yourself; but once you have promised others, you must fulfill your promise.

Strive to nurture that beautiful little spark in your heart – the name of this little spark is "conscience."

### Lin Daqin's Ignorance of Historical Facts

— Zheng Guoyi

Chaozhou's culture has always been dilapidated. Since Han Changli (Han Yu) of the Tang Dynasty was demoted here, people gradually began to value learning. Taking advantage of Duke Wen's (Han Yu's posthumous title) influence, they boasted of themselves as "Zou Lu (a place of culture and education) by the sea." However, when I examine the prominent historical figures, they are very few, and I can count them on my fingers. Their achievements were mostly at the level of Weng Wanda. After him, there was no one worth mentioning. However, Chaozhou people value success in the imperial examinations, so the name of Lin Daqin, who won the first place in the Ming Dynasty, is uniquely prominent. Even today, people frequently mention his name, using it as a source of pride. Daqin's writings are not widely seen. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of one or two in local and county gazetteers, but they are superficial and not far beyond mediocrity. But when I read his "Record of the Reconstruction of Yunyan," it is extremely desolate and full of empty words. Daqin said: "Qi Zhang (Niu Sengru) and Pingquan (Li Deyu) ordered their descendants not to lend even a stone to others. Now their descendants have not been without incidents. This rock is located in a remote mountain, and it has not been obtained by powerful people. Therefore, even after changing generations, later people can still repair the remnants of the relics and restore them to their original state. Isn't this fortunate?" Qi Zhang refers to Niu Sengru (Sengru was conferred Duke of Qizhang), while Pingquan is actually about the affairs of Duke Wei Li Deyu. Those who have some knowledge of records can all speak of it. Daqin was ignorant and did not know, isn't it a laughingstock? Some say that the affairs of Wei Gong's Pingquan are only seen in novels, and not recorded in history. It is not a serious matter that Daqin made a mistake. This is not the case. The Old History of the Five Dynasties says: "At the beginning, when Deyu was a general and minister, he made great contributions to the royal family, and served as a regional official for many dynasties. When he stayed in Luoyang, he had the ambition to spend the rest of his life there. He built a villa in Pingquan, collected rare flowers and strange bamboos from all over the world, and exotic stones, as a garden. He wrote a family motto to record where he obtained the plants and trees, and inscribed it on a stone, saying: 'If you move my stone or break a branch of a tree, you are not my descendants.' During the chaos of Chao Cai, Luoyang was reduced to ashes. Zhang Quanyi cleared the weeds and established the capital. The flowers and trees of the Li family were mostly moved and dug up in the capital by woodcutters for sale. The garden was swept away." (The above is seen in the biography of Li Jingyi. Jingyi was the grandson of Duke Wei Deyu, the Grand Commandant.) The history is described in such detail, how can it be said that it is not recorded? Therefore, I know that Daqin is not only too shallow in his knowledge, but also never reads historical books. Wei Gong's Pingquan motto is often cited by later generations, and it is not an obscure allusion. Moreover, the origins and endings of the Niu (Sengru) and Li (Deyu) factions are something that everyone must learn. To not distinguish this, I cannot imagine what books Daqin has read. Lin Daqin's mistake of Niu for Li has already caused the ridicule of knowledgeable people! And those who compiled the local gazetteer used the power of many people, but they also rashly published it without examining its errors. This is even more ignorant. I often lament that Chaozhou lacks the seeds of reading, and this proves that there is truly no one there.

### Giving Gifts

— Mei

Mrs. Qiong said happily to the country boy, "When I see your mother tomorrow, I must thank her for giving me such a delicious cake."

The little boy hesitated for a moment and said, "Ma'am, can you thank her for giving you such delicious 'two' cakes?"

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 11 Full of Doubts 78

At this time, Qi Huan's nerves were greatly stimulated, so she went with the flow and no longer restrained herself. Qi Huan's intention was not about the wine, but to use this opportunity to make Zhu Zhai feel disheartened. However, Zhongjie regarded Qi Huan as a treasure falling from the sky, and once he got it, he never wanted to let it run away again. That night, Qi Huan wanted to go back several times, but Zhongjie used excuses to keep her, and it was not until the afternoon of the next day that she returned with Miao Zhongjie in the same car. Zhongjie went to Qi Huan's boudoir and saw that every room was decorated very elegantly. He had been fighting outside for many years, half his life on horseback, and it was his first time trying such gentleness. After he arrived in Beiping, although he continued to indulge in entertainment venues, most of what he saw were prostitutes and "hotel girls." Qi Huan's residence had the atmosphere of a noble lady, and it was the first time he had experienced it since arriving in Beiping. Therefore, as soon as he arrived at Qi Huan's home, he looked around in the front and back rooms and could not bear to leave. He and Qi Huan sat on the fur in the guest room, asking about this and that. Although he was a military man, he was good at words in front of women and was good at understanding women's psychology. Qi Huan usually had high standards and did not pay much attention to anyone. Even to Miao Zhongjie, she only thought of using him to stimulate Zhu Zhai and did not sincerely want to befriend him. However, since they met, Zhongjie tried his best to flatter her and carefully pleased Qi Huan. That day in Qi Huan's room, they whispered to each other, and talked for two hours before he was willing to leave. Zhu Zhai was so angry that his hands and feet were ice-cold. He wanted to go back several times, but Xiao Wang's mother kept him, not allowing him to leave, saying, "Now that you are here, and you have suffered all day yesterday, you should tell the boss about this situation. I think the boss must have a reason for getting to know people in the military. Don't you think so?" After being told this by Xiao Wang's mother, Zhu Zhai's anger subsided slightly. He thought, if I just leave like this, it would show that I am narrow-minded and give Qi Huan a bad impression. It would be better to wait for her guest to leave, then I will go in and advise her not to make friends with these rich people, as they are only playing around. After thinking this, Zhu Zhai nodded in agreement. Xiao Wang's mother let him sit in the wing room and wait. Zhu Zhai patiently waited for another hour before the guest left. By this time, it was already dark. Qi Huan sent the guest back, and Zhu Zhai originally wanted to rush out of the wing room and ask her, but then he thought, it would be bad for Qi Huan's face if I did that. It would be more appropriate to wait for Xiao Wang's mother to inform her before I go up. So he stayed in the room and did not come out. After more than ten minutes, Xiao Wang's mother pushed the door and came in.

Reader Consultation

### No Provision for Pre-Collecting Business Tax on Goods Still in Transit

Mr. Wang Renzhi of Wu Tongtai Grain Store in Taixian County asks: Regarding the reinstatement of the grain business tax, although the grain merchants nationwide are still requesting continued exemption, whether it can be approved is another matter. Now there are several doubts that I would like to have answered. If you can forward them to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance for explanation, I would be even more grateful.

(1) What is the object of the grain business tax collection? (2) Are boats and vehicles transporting grain subject to collection? (3) Is it necessary to have a special tax ticket for grain in transit in order to pass through? (4) Is it legal for the local authorities here to set up checkpoints on major roads and collect business tax from passing boats and vehicles? (5) According to Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Business Tax Law promulgated by the National Government on April 16, 1946, "Factories or producers that have already paid factory tax or production tax" are exempt from business tax. Are raw materials purchased by factories that pay production tax exempt while in transit?

[Answer from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance]: (1) The object of the grain trading industry is the price of the goods sold (income amount). The object of the grain brokerage industry is the business income (commission or handling fee). (2) Boats and vehicles transporting grain are regarded as the transportation industry and are taxed at a rate based on the business income (freight). (3) Regarding the third, fourth, and fifth points of the original question, after investigation, the business tax is not levied on "goods" but on "people." It should only be levied when the business operator engages in business activities and has an actual sale. (Residential merchants are taxed monthly, while traveling merchants are taxed each time). However, all business operators (whether residential or traveling merchants) should apply for registration with the local business tax authority before starting business according to law. As for business operators whose goods are still in transit and there is no sales activity, there is no provision for pre-collecting business tax according to law. If there is such a situation, you can state the facts, attach the documents, and report it for punishment.

### Selling Paper Molds to Relieve Poverty and Illness
