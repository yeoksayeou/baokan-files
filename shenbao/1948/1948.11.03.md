### President Weng and Finance Minister Wang Firmly Resign; Executive Yuan to Discuss This Morning

[Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has scheduled a regular meeting for the morning of the 3rd, during which President Weng Wenhao will report on his resignation and it will be discussed. It is understood that Mr. Weng's determination to resign is extremely firm, and the entire cabinet will resign accordingly. However, as of the evening of the 2nd, there has been no contact among the political committee members regarding this matter. If there is an intention to resign en masse, it will be decided at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 3rd. During his report to the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 2nd, Weng repeatedly declared his resignation and emphasized that economic issues would require the efforts of his successor. Mr. Weng believes that although the purpose of the economic reform supplementary measures passed by the Executive Yuan was to save the current economic crisis, the financial and economic reforms he presided over had completely failed due to the abandonment of price controls. Therefore, he repeatedly submitted his resignation to the President from the 31st and personally requested to resign. The President is still trying to persuade Mr. Weng to stay. Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, who presided over the economic reforms and implemented the new currency system, also requested to resign to Weng on the 31st. To show his determination, Wang has not been to the ministry since the 1st and did not attend the Legislative Yuan report on the 2nd, but was represented by his Vice Minister, Xu Baiyuan. Wang told reporters who visited him on the morning of the 2nd that he hoped the government would decide on a successor for the Finance Minister as soon as possible, and that he himself intended to pursue a teaching career.

Weng Reports to Legislative Yuan; Declares Financial and Economic Reforms a Failure

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] The 16th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 2nd, presided over by Speaker Sun. First, the secretariat read out the Executive Yuan's official dispatch in a closed session, stating that the Executive Yuan had received both inquiries from the Legislative Yuan and had paid attention to the current serious financial and economic situation. It had decided to announce four supplementary economic reform measures on October 30th to seek remedies and requested review. However, the members expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of Executive Yuan President Weng and his cabinet members. Zhao Huimo spoke, criticizing the government for abandoning price controls rashly, breaking faith with the people, and said that whether President Weng resigns or not, he should still be held responsible. He should invite President Weng and Finance Minister Wang to report to the Legislative Yuan and answer questions, and not simply "review" the matter. The chairman consulted the members' opinions, and it was passed without objection that President Weng and Finance Minister Wang would be invited to report in the afternoon and be prepared for questioning. Then, at 10 o'clock, the agenda was opened to the public, and the meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock. The meeting continued at 3 PM, with Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao, along with Chief Accountant Xu Kan, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, Minister of Food Guan Jiyu, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, and Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Zhang Zizhu, attending and making reports. Weng first declared that the financial and economic reforms he had been working on had failed, and he himself had resigned to take responsibility. The expected goals of the financial and economic reforms were ten. Reviewing the results of the implementation since then: (1) Balancing revenue and expenditure failed completely. (2) Retrieving gold, silver, and foreign currency had considerable success. (3) Cracking down on usury. (4) Increasing bank deposits. (5) Handling foreign exchange. Foreign currency deposits. (6) Prohibiting capital flight, etc., all had initial achievements, but all failed later. (7) Stabilizing prices also failed due to the impact of the above-mentioned failures. (8) Encouraging production had no achievements. (9) Increasing foreign trade volume. (10) Increasing overseas remittances, initially achieved remarkable results, but today there is nothing left. The government discovered at the end of September that the various goals were not being achieved as expected and immediately formulated a plan to take steps from October 1st to reasonably adjust the prices of essential goods, open up production loans, improve the treatment of public servants and teachers, increase wages, and increase the prices of state-owned public utilities. However, due to the sudden intensification of the offensive by the northern bandits and the repeated defeats of the national army, the plan could not be implemented as scheduled. After this delay, panic buying broke out in various cities, leading to a complete standstill of production and marketing, and the financial and economic situation was unprecedentedly serious. The main reason for triggering the panic buying was, undoubtedly, inflation. The huge military and political expenditures and the reliance on subsidies to maintain state-owned transportation and public utilities led to a sharp increase in the issuance of Gold Yuan notes. The redemption of gold, silver, and foreign currency also created a large amount of floating capital. The government had adopted various measures to absorb floating capital, such as setting deadlines for commercial firms to increase capital, selling state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet industries, and issuing short-term treasury bills. However, in fact, very little Gold Yuan notes returned to the market, and the effect was minimal. The financial and economic situation continued to deteriorate, leading to the supplementary measures announced on October 30th to seek remedies.

Four Important Tasks for the Future; All Await the Continued Efforts of the Successor

Weng pointed out that the work that must be continued in the future is nothing more than the following: (1) Tighten expenditures as much as possible, (2) Reduce subsidies as much as possible, (3) Absorb floating capital, (4) Effectively support production enterprises and encourage increased exports, so as to make materials abundant, reduce issuance, and restore the credit of the Gold Yuan notes. At this point, Weng reiterated that he himself had resigned, and the effectiveness would depend on the efforts of his successor. He then explained several points of the supplementary economic reform measures. Relaxing price controls was one of the main points of the supplementary measures. Since the government's financial and economic reforms and the issuance of the Gold Yuan notes, floating capital had gradually flooded the market, and the bandits had repeatedly disrupted and destroyed it, leading to market disorder and imbalances in supply and demand. Only in this way could the inflow of materials into the bandit areas be restricted to restore the normal order of industry and commerce. (2) The "cost-plus pricing" method was for local trade associations to propose the prices of various goods, which would be submitted to the local government for verification and implementation based on their costs. (3) Regarding the adjustment of the treatment of civil and military personnel, the principle had been decided, based on the prices of essential goods, but the specific measures had not yet been formulated. (4) The measures to support production enterprises included supplying Japanese reparations goods and machinery, allocating foreign exchange to order foreign raw materials, parts, etc. Weng's report lasted about half an hour, and the members responded with warm applause.

### Guan Jiyu Reports on Grain Administration; Xu Baiyuan Represents Finance Minister Wang in Answering Questions; Legislative Members Criticize Executive Yuan's Missteps

Guan Jiyu then reported on the grain supply situation. He listed approximate figures to explain that the total amount of military grain, public grain, and ration grain that must be prepared by the central government is about 75 million dan. The sources, in addition to land tax collection and borrowing, can receive about 25 million dan, and the rest must be purchased, including about 6 million dan of remaining public grain purchased by provinces and counties, about 16 million dan entrusted to various provincial governments to handle, and about 26 million dan entrusted to national banks to purchase (about 8 million dan purchased from abroad). Purchasing is quite difficult, but the government is making every effort to do so. Although this year's grain production in various regions is not very abundant, there should not be a grain shortage immediately after the autumn harvest. Reviewing the reasons for grain shortages in various regions, there are three main points: (1) Price controls are too low, leading to hoarding due to panic buying, (2) Various regions prohibit grain from leaving the region, and the source of the rice market is not smooth, (3) Materials cannot be exchanged, and farmers and grain households are unwilling to sell. The supplementary measures have stipulated that grain can be freely transported and sold at market prices, which can eliminate these three reasons for grain shortages and eliminate the temporary man-made grain shortage. After Guan's report, the members questioned why Finance Minister Wang Yunwu refused to attend. President Weng then ordered Xu Baiyuan to explain on his behalf. Xu stated that Minister Wang had resigned to President Weng the day before yesterday and therefore did not attend the invitation. Regarding the implementation of financial and economic reforms, President Weng had given a detailed report, and he was willing to answer any questions on behalf of Minister Wang. Then the questioning began. The members who spoke included Huang Yuanbin, Huang Jianzhong, Li Yunliang, Zhao Huimo, Wen Shiyuan, Chen Mingxian, Song Shuciao, etc. However, there were more criticisms of the Executive Yuan's mistakes and speeches of personal opinions, and fewer questions were raised. Huang Yuanbin advocated making good use of the retrieved gold, silver, and foreign currency to reverse the crisis. Huang Jianzhong and Zhao Huimo both emphasized that the Jardine Matheson case should be investigated and questioned. Why did the government collect gold banknotes and not target wealthy families but take away the savings of small and medium-sized producers? Zhao Huimo also advocated that the President should announce to the people of the country that the financial deficit in the future would be completely offset by the property of wealthy families to suppress the expansion of issuance and stabilize the people's hearts. Chen Mingxian questioned how to compensate the people for the losses suffered since the financial and economic reforms, from price controls to the cancellation of price controls, how to correct the greater concentration of wealth, and how to fairly and reasonably conclude the cases of innocent merchants who were detained by the Special Criminal Court. Song Shuciao pointed out that the system was wrong, and the Executive Yuan, as a responsible cabinet, was not responsible to the Legislative Yuan. Everything was decided by the President, which was the root cause of all failures and mistakes. The questioning lasted until 5:50 PM, and there were still 15 members who had not had the opportunity to speak. Speaker Sun consulted the members' opinions and proposed to stop the questioning and let President Weng answer orally. Weng said that he did not intend to answer immediately, and some members also advocated "no need to answer." The meeting was then adjourned.

[Central News Agency San Francisco, 2nd United Press] Lapham, Director of the China Division of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, recently described the overall situation in China as quite bleak and warned that the United States must extend the Cold War to China to defeat the Communist Party. Earlier, the mayor of San Francisco said that if the United States abandons China, it would not be in the best interest of the United States, and China is one of the most important parts of Asia. He said that the fall of Shenyang does not mean that the Communist Party has won the civil war.

Bridges' committee will ask China why it has not yet received military aid from the United States and why U.S. aid to China has been delayed. Today, all newspapers reported that the first batch of "large-scale" military supplies to China will be shipped within two days, which was apparently conveyed after our representatives here and the U.S. Army recently reached a final agreement.

Editorial

### Northeast, China, Asia, the World

-- Welcoming Mr. Paulitz to China Again --

Mr. Still, a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune, interviewed President Chiang Kai-shek in Beiping the day before yesterday, asking about the importance of China in the world's anti-communist struggle, China's position in another world war, and the impact on the world situation if the Communists unfortunately controlled China. President Chiang replied solemnly, not only pointing out the close relationship between the Northeast problem and the world crisis, but also saying: "China is working hard to suppress the Communists, eliminating powerful factors that threaten world peace and preventing the outbreak of a third world war." "The traditional strategy of the Communist International to carry out world revolution, and its current direction of expansion, both take Asia as their main target, and China is the decisive point for the future of Asia. The Communist creed is that to control the world, you must first control Asia, and to control Asia, you must first control China. I can assert that if China is controlled by the Communists, the Third World War will inevitably break out, causing humanity to suffer another tragic disaster."

President Chiang's remarks to the American reporter fully demonstrate that the President not only has a correct understanding of the world situation, but also has keen insight. Therefore, Chinese and foreign newspapers and magazines have uniformly published them, and readers are full of admiration for the President's true knowledge and foresight. Recalling seventeen years ago, when the Japanese warlords launched the September 18th Incident and seized our Northeast by force. Although the diplomatic authorities of the great powers, such as US Secretary of State Stimson, called for a "non-recognition" policy, no one recognized that this was the starting point for Japan's conquest of the world, or the signal for the Second World War. China was left to struggle alone. Before long, it eventually evolved into a Second World War that spread throughout the world, and they suddenly realized that the Second World War originated in Northeast China. Unfortunately, mankind is still forgetful. Even with the great talent and strategy of the late US President Roosevelt, at the end of the victory of the war, he ignored this painful lesson. The arrangement of the Yalta Conference on the Northeast problem left a root of disaster for our Northeast problem! Since the end of the war, the endless wars in the Northeast in the past three years, to the point of creating a situation similar to the "September 18th" incident today, are all caused by a wrong move. Unfortunately, this new crisis has been neglected by the world, so that although the United States has sometimes issued intermittent calls for "aid to China" in the past two or three years, it has not seen any timely emergency action. Now that this crisis has been pointed out frankly by President Chiang, it should awaken the diplomatic authorities of the great powers to be particularly vigilant about Asia, right?

Objectively speaking, the so-called "Truman Doctrine" and the so-called "Marshall Plan" all have anti-communism as their consistent goal. Especially in the "Cold War" between the great powers and the Soviet Union, they are doing their best to exert their full strength. The "North Atlantic Anti-Communist Alliance," which has been sung loudly recently, seems to be even more impressive, but when we look at the anti-communist struggle in the past year, we cannot help but say that "we are retreating step by step and lagging behind." In the problem of the Berlin Blockade, we have seen the firm stance of the Western Allies, but the "Europe first, Asia later" strategy has been used by the Communist forces, starting with Southeast Asia, making all Southeast Asian countries threatened by the Communist forces. The line of sight of the Communist International then shifted to Northeast Asia. The outbreak of the rebellion in South Korea and the complete fall of our Northeast into the hands of the Communists are enough to prove that Northeast Asia will also be controlled by the Communist International. Looking again at the US policy toward China after the war, the US government has adopted a policy of aid in principle, and has assisted China economically and militarily from time to time, but the quantity and timing of aid have become problems, giving people the feeling of "a drop in the bucket" and "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." If this policy error is not remedied as soon as possible, the crisis in the Far East may not be saved, and one day it will endanger the peace of the entire world!

There is no shortage of wise and talented people in the United States, especially Mr. Paulitz and Mr. Chow I-te, who have long seen the growing crisis in the Far East and believe that the current US policy toward China may create a historical mistake. They have spared no effort to run around and appeal, urging the US government and the public to face reality, raise awareness, and quickly step up aid to China. After returning to the country from his previous trip to China, Mr. Paulitz published an article entitled "Impressions of My Visit to China," which was righteous and solemn and was circulated by concerned people around the world, not only deeply concerned by the Chinese people. Now that Mr. Paulitz has been ordered by Congress to come to China again to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of China's political situation and diagnose the crisis in Asia, it is worthy of our special attention and warm welcome. However, because the time is urgent, it has reached a critical moment, and everything must be done quickly. We hope that Mr. Paulitz will come to China as soon as possible, so that he can bring the real situation in Asia back to the country as soon as possible, so that the US government and the public can pay special attention to the crisis in the Northeast, China, Asia, and the world, and never again treat the Chinese government's suppression of bandits and pacification of chaos as China's internal affairs, nor stubbornly adhere to the established idea of "Europe first, Asia later," allowing the power of the communist totalitarian state to spread throughout China and Asia, so that it is too late to regret!

### Senior Chinese Seafarer Organizations Write to the U.S. Ambassador, Opposing the Promotion of Japanese Aviation Industry, Responding to the Claims of the U.S. Shipping Association

[News from our Newspaper] According to Jiang Keni, an executive of the Federation of Senior Chinese Merchant Seafarer Organizations: Because the US government has adopted an active support policy, Japan will soon realize its ideal of 4 million tons of new ships. Currently, Japan is actively building new ships, and a certain shipyard has already started building 19 merchant ships. This trend is a great threat to the Chinese shipping industry, and it is hoped that people who care about the construction of the Chinese shipping industry will pay attention to it. It is learned that five senior seafarer organizations, in response to the US shipping industry's opposition to supporting the Japanese aviation industry, sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart last month, requesting the US government to restrict the Japanese aviation industry. The original letter is as follows: To His Excellency Ambassador Stuart: According to the report of the Johnston Investigation Group of your country, the Japanese aviation industry can restore its 1930 to 1934 standards. In other words, your country will allow Japan to restore 4 million tons of merchant ships and re-establish its aggressive forces. This move poses a great threat to the Allied countries in the Far East, especially China, which, after the victory, has failed to embark on the road of construction due to various factors. However, the enemy who first invaded Chinese territory, massacred the Chinese people, and destroyed the tonnage of Chinese ships is rapidly restoring its overwhelming superiority in dominating the Far East under the support of your country. This cannot but cause an extraordinarily unfavorable reaction among the people of our country in terms of both fact and psychology. Our associations, in shipping circles, both labor and management, have successively lodged protests against this, and other countries such as Australia, the Philippines, and the Soviet Union have also made solemn opposition to your country's excessively pro-Japanese policy, which I believe is well understood. Now, reading the protest documents of the American Shipping Association, which represents more than two-thirds of your country's shipping industry, against the Johnston report, its reasons and its long-term vision are deeply admirable. It can be seen that justice still exists in the world. We are writing to your Excellency the Ambassador again, requesting that you forward to your country's government that the restoration of the Japanese aviation industry should still be based on the standard of making it only usable for domestic trade and its nearby islands. Otherwise, it will constitute a threat to peace in the Far East and endanger world peace and tranquility. We hope that you will give your attention to this matter. Initiated by: Chinese Merchant Ship Masters Association, Chinese Maritime Masters Federation, Chinese Marine Engineers Association, Chinese Ship Wireless Telegraphists Association, Songhan Area Pilot Association.

Returned to Nanjing by the same plane yesterday afternoon

[News from our Newspaper] Minister of National Defense He Yingqin flew from Nanjing to Shanghai by special plane yesterday morning to inspect the Jiangwan National Defense Medical College. Among those who came with him were Badawei, head of the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group to China, and Lin Kesheng, director of the Military Medical Department and president of the National Defense Medical College.

He was very pleased that the college was able to produce orange mildew to replace penicillin. He also deeply appreciated the college's efforts to produce plasma, dissolve DDT, study the extraction of soybeans to make them the simplest and most nutritious universal food for the troops, and the ideal level of the faculty. At 11:00, he convened a meeting with all faculty, staff, and students, and Minister He pointed out that at least 50,000 military doctors should be deployed among our country's existing 5 million troops in order to maintain a high level of combat effectiveness at all times, but currently there are only about 2,000 military medical personnel serving in the military, and the total number of registered doctors in the country is only about 15,000, so military doctors need to be trained in large numbers. He also explained the importance of the status of military medical personnel in today's national defense, and encouraged all members of the college that in addition to having the academic knowledge, skills, and morality that doctors should have, they should also cultivate the personality, spirit, and discipline that soldiers should have. They should study hard at the college and advance and retreat with the combat troops in the future, sharing life and death, in order to achieve our country's goal of cultivating military doctors and building military medicine. After the speech, the party had lunch at the college and went to Qimei Road and Nanshi to inspect the hygiene material warehouse at four o'clock. He returned to Nanjing by the same plane.

According to Mr. Liu, he has two important tasks on this trip: (1) to request financial and economic assistance from the central government for Xinjiang Province, and (2) to request Xinjiang Province to use gold yuan vouchers, because the current ratio of Xinjiang currency to gold yuan vouchers is 600,000 Xinjiang currency to 1 gold yuan voucher, which is quite inconvenient to calculate.

### Five Million Americans Begin Voting; Election Results to be Revealed This Afternoon; Eastern Towns Show Early Strength; Progressive Party and Southern Votes Pose Significant Challenge to Truman

[Report from Our Own Correspondent] New York, 2nd (via Radio): Election results from Charleston, West Virginia: Dewey received 182 votes, Truman received 55 votes. Dewey shows a clear advantage.

[United Press, Bart Township, New Hampshire, 2nd] This town is the first to announce election results nationwide. Truman received 1 vote, Dewey received 11 votes. In the 1944 election, Roosevelt received 6 votes, and Dewey received 4 votes.

[United Press, New York, 2nd] Forty-seven to fifty million American free men and women are expected to vote on the 2nd to elect their president. A world half enslaved and half free is also awaiting the election results. Across the United States, although some areas will experience rain, most will be sunny. The election will begin at dawn on the Atlantic coast and gradually move west with the sunrise. Some New England rural towns will count their votes and report them on morning radio programs. The time and place of the first major election result will be 4 PM Eastern Standard Time in eastern Kentucky. The time and place of the last votes cast will be before 11 PM in Washington state. Shortly after this time, news agencies and newspapers will be able to calculate the results of approximately eight million votes representing various states. Unless the election result is very close, the trend should be clear before midnight. Truman will vote in his hometown of Independence, Missouri, at 11 AM Eastern Standard Time. He has decided to go to bed early on the 2nd and not wait to see if the election is decided. However, his secretary, Ross, said that Truman may be awakened in the evening if necessary. Dewey will vote at a public school at 121 East 5th Street in New York and then return to the Republican headquarters at the Roosevelt Hotel to await the election results. Dewey is the only presidential candidate listed on the ballots of every state in the country. Truman lost Alabama, where the Democratic name and symbol were taken by the States' Rights faction. States' Rights candidate Thurmond is listed on the ballots of thirteen states. Progressive Party candidate Wallace is on the ballot in forty-five states, and Socialist Party candidate Thomas is on the ballot in thirty-one states. The votes for the States' Rights, Progressive, and Socialist parties are all likely to dilute Truman's strength. Dewey has a good chance of winning Florida and Tennessee, two Democratic strongholds in the South. Voters will also elect thirty-two senators, four hundred and thirty-two representatives, thirty-two governors, and countless minor officials.

[United Press, New York, 1st] President Truman broke the tradition of a political truce on the eve of the election by broadcasting to the nation from his hometown of Independence, attacking Dewey and the Republican Party. Dewey believes that he will win when the election results are revealed at midnight on the 2nd (1 PM on the 3rd, Shanghai time). In his final campaign speech, he urged the American people to vote enthusiastically and called on the Republican and Democratic parties to unite after the election results are announced. But Truman almost rejected this call in his broadcast, saying that the election on the 2nd would be a choice between the peace and prosperity of a Democratic government and the war and depression of a Republican government.

### The Main Duel Between the Two Major American Parties is for Control of the Senate; Republican Victory is Not Guaranteed

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 1st] Public opinion polls generally predict that the Republican Party will maintain a majority of forty to fifty seats in the House of Representatives, thus controlling the House. But the main duel will be for control of the Senate. The current Senate includes fifty-one Republicans and forty-five Democrats. However, the terms of thirty-two members (seventeen Republicans and fifteen Democrats) expire this year. Therefore, both parties must compete for their members' re-election. On the day of this election, no pollster dares to predict with certainty that the Republican Party will win in the Senate election.

Another public opinion poll stated that the Senate would be evenly divided between the two parties, with each occupying forty-eight seats. If the Senate is so formed, the Vice President would have the decisive vote on legislative matters. This year's American election is of great importance to foreign relations. Therefore, the State Department's "Voice of America" will report the election results in sixteen languages tomorrow night.

### Truman Feels He Will No Longer Be Master of the White House

Compares the White House to the Best Prison in the World

[Central News Agency, Kansas City, 1st] If the public opinion polls in the United States are correct, Dewey will be elected the 33rd President of the United States tomorrow, and President Truman will be released from the White House, which he considers the best prison in the world. Truman said at a banquet here tonight: "You all know that the President of the United States is the most important prisoner in the world, and the White House is the best prison in the world." President Truman may have anticipated that he will no longer be the hardworking master of the White House for four years.

### Entire New York City Police Force Mobilized to Assist in Election

Stock Market Consistently Firm

[United Press, New York, 2nd] The entire New York City police force of eighteen thousand two hundred and thirty-two officers was specially mobilized for the election on the 2nd. At 6 AM, two thousand two hundred detectives were already on duty, expelling all undesirable elements so that they could not remain on the streets. Police Commissioner Wallender ordered strict prevention of accidents.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] On the eve of the American election, the New York stock market was consistently firm. Most brokers hoped that a Republican victory would lead to the modification of some of the Democratic government's trading restrictions. These restrictions are intended to prevent a recurrence of the economic collapse of 1929.

### Progressive Party to be Tested Amidst American Election

Feared That It Cannot Obtain a Single District Vote

[United Press, New York, 2nd] Wallace's new Progressive Party will face its first major test at the polling places on the 2nd. According to pre-election predictions, Wallace may not be able to obtain a single district electoral vote. As for the popular vote, it is estimated to be around two million. Wallace has been working hard until the day of the election, but he has never mentioned how many votes he may get. On the contrary, he has repeatedly declared that the party will maintain its existence.

### UN General Assembly to Hold Plenary Meeting Today to Discuss Atomic Energy Control; All Parties Quietly Await End of US Election

[Associated Press, Paris, 1st] The United Nations Political Committee will resume discussions on the Greek issue on the 2nd. However, the world's top diplomats are all awaiting the results of the US election. The Political Committee plans to meet all day to conclude the general debate and produce concrete action. The UN General Assembly also plans to hold a plenary session on the 3rd to consider a final decision on the atomic energy stalemate. It is reported that most delegates are prepared to support the US atomic energy control plan.

The UN General Assembly will also discuss a resolution passed by the Political Committee, despite Soviet opposition. This resolution requires the five great powers and Canada to discuss the possibility of an agreement on atomic energy issues and submit a report to the next General Assembly. The Security Council will study the Palestinian issue on the 4th, marking the first test of American diplomacy after the election. The Security Council will consider a proposal from China and the United Kingdom, mainly to order the Arab and Jewish sides to return to their original positions before the outbreak of war on October 14, and to order the Jewish side to abandon the occupied areas. If one side refuses, the resolution will impose sanctions. The US delegation originally supported the Sino-British proposal, but President Truman's direct intervention caused the US to withdraw its support. There is no sign of what the US position will be after the election. The UN General Assembly delegates are extremely concerned about the US election and believe that if the Republican Party wins, there will be some changes in the US delegation's strategy. However, general American foreign policy will not change. On the other hand, if Truman wins, US policy will consistently intensify and there will be some important changes to end the main debate. Secretary of State Marshall returned here from London on the 1st. Dulles, who may become Dewey's Secretary of State, also returned to Paris after touring the Scandinavian countries over the weekend. It is believed that both Marshall and Dulles have drafted methods so that domestic reports can be quickly transmitted here.

### Shaw Comments on Stalin's Speech; Does Not Believe Soviets Will Initiate War

[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] George Bernard Shaw wrote in the British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" that "Stalin's frank and clear speech last week was a breath of fresh air. British newspapers do not understand the meaning of communism, so their actions are strange. Their aimless attacks on their opponents are just like unreasonable people in the suburbs throwing dead cats at each other over a garden wall. One dead cat is called totalitarianism, another is called a police state, and the third is called defending against Soviet aggression. But the ruthless fact is that these dead cats are all thrown from our side. What Stalin fears most is another imperialist war. He is too busy with domestic rule to have time for impossible military conquest and world annexation." Shaw continued, saying that the Soviet totalitarianism and police state that the West accuses them of are now flourishing in the British Commonwealth. Although we attack the so-called secret police, we have not therefore abolished our country's Criminal Investigation Department and Police Department.

### Greece to Recruit New Soldiers; Will Fully Suppress Guerrillas

The Greek government adopted this decision after the Chairman of the Peloponnese National Assembly Committee, Kanellopoulos, consulted with US Ambassador Grady and the head of the US military delegation to Greece, Van Fleet.

### Our Country Holds a Cautious Attitude Towards Concluding a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan, Leaving Out the Soviet Union; Experts Believe the Focus Should Be on Sino-Soviet Relations

[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the American report that Republican foreign policy may consider concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan, leaving out the Soviet Union, senior officials in Nanjing's political circles have remained silent. Only one expert on foreign affairs stated that this issue should be approached with caution. The government should conduct a detailed study of the following issues: (1) the past and future of Sino-Soviet relations; (2) whether the Soviet Union's policy towards Japan is in line with our interests; (3) what are the actual advantages and disadvantages of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan, leaving out the Soviet Union; (4) the development of the overall world situation. After weighing these factors, a clear attitude should be adopted.

### KKK Demonstrates on Eve of US Election

### Tokyo Tribunal to Reconvene Tomorrow; War Criminals Tojo and Others to be Sentenced

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] It was announced on the 2nd that the Eleven-Nation International Military Tribunal for the Far East will reconvene on the 4th at the former Japanese Ministry of Defense building to announce the verdicts regarding Tojo and twenty-four other Class A war criminals. The Far East Military Tribunal has been adjourned for nearly half a year, during which time the judges from various countries have meticulously studied the approximately nine million words of evidence and arguments collected during the trial. According to unofficial estimates, the trial will continue for at least ten days or so before the final verdict is announced. Some estimators even estimate that it will take several weeks, as they estimate that at least 2,500 pages of documents will be mentioned during the trial, and only about 200 pages can be mentioned during each day's trial time. It is generally expected that the defendants' lawyers will request MacArthur to reduce the sentences after the verdict, as MacArthur, in his position as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, is the final reviewing authority. There is currently no prediction as to when the sentences will be carried out after they are pronounced.

### Soviets Denounce Building a World Government as Wishful Thinking

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Moscow Radio broadcast that anyone who believes that building a world government led by British and American imperialists will prevent war from happening again is indulging in wishful thinking.

### US to Negotiate Tariff Reductions with Eleven Countries

### Major Corruption Case in Japan Involves Ashida Hitoshi

### Mayor Summons Representatives from Rice, Grain, and Other Industries; Listens to Reports on Price Adjustments; Advises Against Seeking Excessive Profits; Orders Resumption of Transactions Starting Today; Meat and Vegetable Industries Indicate Prices Will Definitely Fall

[Report from Our Own Correspondent] Mayor Wu summoned the chairmen of the industry associations for daily necessities such as rice, oil, flour, fresh meat, vegetables, and miscellaneous grains to the municipal government office at 4 PM yesterday for discussions. He inquired about the adjustment multiples for the prices of various items after the lifting of price controls, and earnestly advised them not to raise prices excessively or seek excessive profits. Registered inventory should be sold at lower prices, and they should not adopt a wait-and-see attitude. He ordered them to resume trading starting today and to supply the market needs as much as possible. Those who were summoned to the municipal government yesterday included Wan Molin from the rice industry, Zhen Hua, Xi Debing from the flour industry, Rong Yiren, Hong Wenjiang from the pig industry, Zhu Gao from the fresh meat industry, Zhang Chao from the oil industry, Chuan Changyu from the miscellaneous grains industry, and Ma Wenbiao from the vegetable industry. According to Zhu Zhigao, chairman of the Fresh Meat Industry Association, fresh meat can be supplied as much as possible starting today. The agreed new price is about 3.5 yuan per catty, and will definitely not exceed 4 yuan. The rumors of 5-6 yuan per catty yesterday were not the official market price, but were raised by individual transporters from other places seeking profit. He also guaranteed that meat prices could fall to within 3 yuan per catty within two weeks after the sources became smooth.

Rong Yiren from the flour industry said that the price of flour has also been agreed upon, with a factory price of 30 yuan per bag and a retail price of about 34 yuan. Supplies have been gradually available since yesterday. The city's daily flour demand is about 11,000 dan. Yesterday, the supply was over 6,000 dan, and efforts will be made to gradually increase it. However, factories have been shut down for half a month, and it will take about a week to fully restore the original state.

Vegetable industry representative Ma Wenbiao said that vegetable prices have been inconsistent in the past two days and there is no fixed price. Mayor Wu instructed him to tell the vendors not to raise prices. The industry association does not have this real power, but it intends to inform the mutual aid association of vegetable vendors to convey the message. He believes that yesterday's vegetable prices cannot be taken as a standard, because the prices were raised due to the scarcity of goods. He is confident that vegetable prices will definitely fall after the internal sources are cleared.

According to Zhen Hua of the rice industry, the market price of rice is 90 yuan per dan. Whether the new price is stable depends on the rice source situation, because the price of rice in the market must be determined based on the prices in the producing areas. If the source is abundant, the rice price will not rise. However, the rice shops in the city have suffered heavy losses due to the 819 price control policy, and their capital is weak. The rice industry association has submitted a document to the municipal government yesterday, requesting relief. Mayor Wu has promised to consider it. The rice merchant representatives also requested the municipal government to guarantee transactions after resumption of business. Mayor Wu has ordered the police to protect the legitimate transactions of rice shops.

After meeting with the representatives of various industries, Mayor Wu met with reporters in the office at 5:30 PM to report on the discussions and answer various questions from newspaper reporters, including: (1) To control prices, a price negotiation committee will be organized, which is being prepared by the Social Affairs Bureau. (2) After the price negotiation is implemented, the citizen purchase certificates to be distributed on the 8th of this month will not guarantee the supply of materials. (3) The adjustment of prices for public utilities will be determined after the calculation of coal, raw materials, and labor costs is completed. (4) Whether the adjustment of employee benefits will still use the cost of living index will be decided by the central government.

### Cigarettes Allowed Free Trade; Industrial Raw Material Pricing; Social Affairs Bureau Temporarily Sets Ten Kinds; Prices of Some Items Have Been Approved

[Report from Our Own Correspondent] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct the industry associations to promptly negotiate prices and open for business, and no longer wait and see. The daily necessities originally stipulated by the Social Affairs Bureau for price negotiation were soybean oil, woolen cloth, woolen yarn stacks, kerosene, coal briquettes, cigarettes, matches and soap, a total of eight kinds. Now it has been decided to change cigarettes to free trade and replace it with economic meals, still a total of eight kinds. Other items not specified for price negotiation can be negotiated by various industries and reported to the bureau for record, without approval, and free trade is allowed. As for industrial raw materials to be priced, the bureau has temporarily set ten kinds, including sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, soda ash, butter, rosin, cowhide, factory silk, dyes, and rubber, and instructed the industry associations to negotiate a cost table based on production or import costs and report it for verification. Relevant industry associations may send representatives to attend the price negotiation. For raw materials with many items, the main ones will be priced, and the rest will be approved with reference to that standard.

Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau approved the adjustment of prices, including an increase of 150% in hospital consultation fees. The book industry increased prices by 150%. The negotiated price of soybean oil was also determined to be adjusted from 60 yuan to 190 yuan, an increase of slightly less than 220%. Also, the film and theater industries were approved to increase prices by 150% the day before yesterday, but it was not implemented yesterday, and will be adjusted starting today.

### Employees' Cigarettes; Ordered to be Rationed at Fair Prices

[Another Report] The Social Affairs Bureau originally approved an increase of 200% in the price of cigarettes yesterday morning, but because the price of cigarettes in Hangzhou and other places had risen to about 600-700 million before, the news spread, and the cigarette shops were snapped up. The Dakang shop in Nanshi was even beaten and suffered losses. At noon, the cigarette industry and the Commercial Industry Association went to the Social Affairs Bureau again to ask for instructions on how to deal with the situation. Director Wu decided that in addition to the cigarettes needed by the city's 1.2 million employees, which must be rationed by the cigarette merchants at fair prices, the rest will be allowed to be negotiated by the industry itself at any time according to market needs, and the Social Affairs Bureau will temporarily not control it.

### Materials Adjustment Committee Resolves; Factory Finished Products; Joint Distribution

[Report from Our Own Correspondent] The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee held its tenth meeting at 11 AM yesterday, chaired by Chairman Liu Gongyun. First, Director Wu Kaixian reported on the price trends in Shanghai, and the heads of the competent authorities of rice, coal, and yarn separately reported on the adjustment of various materials. At the same time, the issue of how to coordinate the adjustment of materials in the future after the promulgation of the supplementary financial measures was raised. The most important decision at yesterday's meeting was that in order to stabilize prices at present, joint distribution must be adopted, and the finished products of each factory should be handled by the relevant industry associations. In this way, price negotiation can be implemented without the occurrence of black markets. In addition, there were also concrete decisions on the planning of industrial coal.

According to the interview, he had been at sea for 38 days and was isolated from the world, so he hoped not to be asked about national affairs and world politics. However, a reporter still asked whether the British Consulate was preparing to evacuate British overseas Chinese in North China. He replied that there was no such plan and no such preparation at all. When talking about his impression of Shanghai, he said that he had heard many surprising news about the shortage of food here before coming to Shanghai, but when the ship arrived at the port, he saw chimneys standing on both sides of the Huangpu River, with black smoke billowing. The streets were lined with shops, proving that this is a thriving industrial and commercial city.

[Report from our Newspaper] At the Heavenly Palace Theater on Central Tibet Road, at approximately 9:30 PM last night, tourist Lu Yongkang, along with friends Yu Zhongbiao, Ding Chungen, and Wang Baosheng, were watching a play when a friend invited Lu outside for a conversation.

### Attending the International Air Transport Conference: Liu Jingyi's Return to China and Remarks - Rapid Progress in Western European Civil Aviation, High Demand for Chinese Tea and Carpets

[Report from our Newspaper] Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, has returned to Shanghai from the 4th International Air Transport Association Conference and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:10 PM. According to Mr. Liu's statement to reporters: (1) This conference was held in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss international air transport safety, passenger convenience, and how to simplify accounting procedures among various airlines. (2) The general productivity of various Western European countries has surpassed pre-war levels, and civil aviation has made particularly rapid progress. For example, the number of personnel at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has increased from 2,000 to 14,000 in the past two and a half years, and the number of aircraft has increased to 100. Similarly, the SAS airline, formed through cooperation between Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, has increased its staff to 6,000 and its aircraft to 63. In contrast, the state of civil aviation in our country leaves no room for complacency. (3) Americans regard travel as a necessary condition for life, spending as much as two billion US dollars annually on trips to Europe. Western European countries are competing fiercely for air traffic in order to attract tourists and earn foreign exchange. In addition to emphasizing equipment, they also pay great attention to passenger convenience. Currently, most countries no longer require visas for passports. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France no longer require passports due to mutual benefit. Although other countries still require visas, the procedures and time have been simplified as much as possible. As a result, the number of tourists to Europe has increased significantly recently, and regardless of trips to the United States or the Far East, reservations must be made two months in advance. (4) Mr. Liu also stated that various foreign friends he contacted in Europe inquired about why our country's special products, Tianjin carpets, have not been seen in European and American markets since the war. In addition, Turkey currently has a strong demand for tea. If our country's tea is transported there, at least 1,500 tons can be sold immediately. He hopes that our country's exporters will pay attention to this.

### Price Controls Lifted - Significant Losses: Edible Oil Retailers Petitioned Yesterday - Requesting Oil Factories to Allocate Goods According to Price Controls

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Oil Trade Association sent representatives to petition the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday. According to them, edible oil retailers had a total of 50,000 dan of oil in stock on August 19th. Later, they complied with the authorities' orders to sell the oil to citizens at controlled prices based on their national identification cards. All 50,000 dan of edible oil were sold out. Now, the authorities are planning for manufacturers to allocate goods to retailers, but the price controls have suddenly been lifted, and prices have risen threefold. Retailers have suffered greatly, losing three-quarters of their stock in value. However, the 200,000 dan of edible oil stored by manufacturers have not been touched.

They requested the Bureau of Social Affairs to adopt this proposal. It was decided to send the above opinions to the central government for adoption and implementation, and representatives from the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union immediately drafted a telegram to the central government, requesting approval. The original telegram is as follows: "To Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan and Minister Gu Jun of the Ministry of Social Affairs, we have gratefully received the Supplementary Measures for Economic Control, Section C, Article 2, which stipulates that wages should be adjusted according to the needs of maintaining workers' livelihoods, reflecting deep compassion for the difficulties of workers. After discussions in winter, everyone agreed that workers' salaries should still be based on August 19th, compiling a cost-of-living index and calculating and issuing salaries from November onwards, and making it public, which is more reasonable and avoids disputes. In addition to requesting the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to adopt this proposal, we respectfully send this telegram seeking your approval. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union, in winter."

### Zhang Yamin Entangles Girlfriend - Wang Huiheng Attempts Suicide and is Rescued - Has Been Suffering from Mental Stimulation and厭厭厭厌 For a Long Time

[Report from our Newspaper] Wang Huiheng, a famous female singer in this city who was repeatedly mentioned in the will of Zhang Yamin, who was previously executed for the case, and said to be his only confidante, suddenly swallowed a large number of sleeping pills on the night of the 31st of last month and attempted suicide. She was discovered and rescued, but due to severe poisoning, she was still in danger as of last night. According to Wang's father, Wang Zhunchen, the motive for Wang's suicide was already revealed in Zhang Yamin's will. When Zhang's wife published an advertisement seeking Wang's photo, Wang's family saw that she looked depressed and sad all day long. At first, they did not pay attention. Later, Wang often wrote poems and songs, full of sorrow. Recently, she took several artistic photos and asked her relatives and friends: "Which one is most suitable for my posthumous portrait?" They realized that she was gradually revealing her desire to die. On the evening of the 29th of last month, Wang still went to the Bilo Hotel for dinner with her family. During the dinner, she sang sentimental lines from the Cheng School opera. On the night of the 31st, her father got up and went to her bedroom, intending to make a precautionary visit, but he found that the doors had been locked tightly. After trying to break into the room, he found that her face was pale, and empty boxes of sleeping pills were scattered all over the floor next to her pillow. According to the investigation, these pills were the most potent pain-relieving sleeping pills. Wang had been gradually buying and hoarding more than 100 pills beforehand. She swallowed 40 pills at once, which proves that her desire to die was extremely strong. In her will, in addition to requesting that she be buried in the Hongqiao Cemetery after her death, she also said: "Superior environment and material enjoyment cannot slightly reduce mental stimulation... Life is like a drama. I never thought that I would be playing a short Cheng School opera..." In addition, she also left 46 posthumous poems, which are even more full of the desire to die. According to Wang's father, Wang Zhunchen has only this one daughter and loves her very much. Wang often took her to social occasions, but because she was silent and寡言, she never had a boyfriend. Although Zhang Yamin had met her several times, it was only a superficial friendship, and Wang was not yet twenty years old, so her father was unwilling to discuss marriage for her. After Wang's suicide attempt, Wang Zhunchen and his wife fainted several times. Currently, because the toxins in her nerves and brain marrow have not been cleared, Wang Ting has asked five or six famous doctors in the city to do their best to rescue her.

The photo of Zhang Yamin returned, taken in the Huangjia Garden.

### Jiang Jingguo Reviews Economic Control Work - Sorrowfully Points Out Reasons for Price Control Failure

When Jiang Jingguo, Economic Control Supervisor of the Shanghai District, gathered the Suppression Construction Brigade and the Youth Service Corps members for training at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, he reviewed the economic control work of the past two months and sorrowfully pointed out that the failure of the price control policy was due to everyone's inability to remain calm. There is no such thing as a harvest without paying a price in the world. The price control policy requires everyone to endure temporary pain in order to seek long-term stability in the lives of the majority of people. Although some people feel relieved to give up price controls today, the threat of high prices is felt by the majority of people, and it is unknown where it will end. However, Mr. Jiang resolutely and calmly claimed that giving up price controls does not mean giving up the fight against unscrupulous merchants. If anyone breaks the law, we will catch unscrupulous merchants every day that we are in Shanghai. He shouted a slogan: "The power of justice must unite today, and we believe that Shanghai will eventually belong to the youth of justice." Mr. Jiang's entire speech was impassioned and full of enthusiasm, and the thousands of young people who listened were greatly moved. He encouraged the young comrades not to be discouraged by setbacks and reviewed the work of the past 70 days. He deeply felt that the newly emerging forces were not yet mature and 反動勢九 had formed a line, colluding with each other, because they deeply feared that "if new forces rise, there will be no place for them." We have high emotions and open minds, but we still lack the experience to fight and are not enough to deal with cunning economic enemies. However, our policies are not wrong. For the country, there can be no individuals; for the sake of the majority of people, we cannot take care of the interests of a minority. We have no shame in our policies towards the country and the people. Therefore, the 70 days of hard work were not in vain. We have paid the price. The people may not fully know it today, but they will surely know in the future that the Suppression Construction Brigade and the Youth Service Corps members did not take a single cent from the people of Shanghai and wholeheartedly served the people. Mr. Jiang continued: The people are our masters. In any case, faithful servants must continue to work hard and serve tirelessly. The difference between us and the bureaucrats is that they are doing it to be officials, while we are doing it to serve. What he deeply laments is that the people could not remain calm when economic controls were gradually implemented. He said that we were not acting recklessly, but were planned and methodical. The raw materials that we purchased from abroad will arrive this month. Because the supply of rice is not smooth, it has been decided to exchange cotton cloth, cotton yarn, and sugar for grain with Jiaxing, Qingpu, and other counties, and an agreement has been reached to start supplying them steadily from the 15th of this month. However, it seems that the general public can no longer wait. Mr. Jiang added: In the two months he has been in Shanghai, he has deeply experienced the meaning of the two phrases "working hard and bearing resentment" and "cunning." He encouraged the team members to work hard, enrich their combat skills, reorganize their teams, strengthen their organization, go deep into the people, assist the government, solve the people's pain, and prevent the division of economic enemies. He said that he will soon establish a large-scale cadre training class in this city to make it the center of Shanghai's youth organization, with a warm heart and a calm mind, to move towards the front of the battle, "not competing for a moment, but competing for thousands of years."

### Increase in Deposit and Loan Interest Rates - Export Industry Hopes for Prompt Adjustment of Exchange Rates

[Report from our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance has accepted the request of the Shanghai money industry to increase the loan interest rate to 1.8% per month, which is almost five times the original rate. The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau immediately convened a meeting after receiving the order from the ministry and notified the money industry of this decision. The money supply has been very tight recently, and black market interest rates are as high as 40% or more. The previously stipulated interest rates are no longer realistic, so the Ministry of Finance decided to increase them after the banking industry applied.

Also, the adjustment of the exchange rate of the gold yuan currency after the lifting of price controls is inevitable, and the industrial and commercial sectors are paying close attention to this issue. The industrial sector hopes that the exchange rate will be determined with special care to avoid hindering domestic production. The export industry hopes for a prompt adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, otherwise the industry will be in a state of stagnation. The competent authorities are still studying this issue. To take into account both imports and exports, it may restore the system of foreign exchange settlement certificates.

Also, according to the Central Bank's Audit Department, the current deposits of the banks in this city in September totaled 214,791,900.29 gold yuan, and the term deposits were 25,994,022.52 gold yuan, for a total of 240,785,922.81 gold yuan. The paid-in reserve was 40,329,039.30 gold yuan.

### Rice is Scarce and Expensive

High-Grade White Japonica Rice in Nanshi is Selling for 90 Yuan

The total arrival of rice at the South Rice Market was 1,168 shi, with a continuous increase in supply, but the supply is still small. There are few spot goods, and transactions are very rare. The prices of high-grade white japonica rice and Bo Dao rice are all 90 yuan. The price of mid-grade early rice has risen from 73 yuan to 77 yuan. High-quality Du Jian rice is priced at 85 yuan. The market is stronger than the previous day. The arrival of goods at the North Rice Market decreased compared to the previous day, totaling only 237 shi. Transactions in the market have stalled due to a lack of goods.

### Not Much Sugar Trading - Prices Have Risen Two and a Half Times

Sugar merchants went to the market one after another yesterday, and although there were many price discussions, actual transactions were very rare. The asking price for No. 24 raw sugar was around 105 yuan, and there were a few transactions, which was about two and a half times the controlled price. There has been no news of other goods.

### Edible Oil Trading Resumes

The edible oil market resumed trading yesterday. As directed by the Bureau of Social Affairs, the price of soybean oil was set at 190 yuan, and other oil prices could be traded with reference to the price of soybean oil. At 11:00 AM, trading began in the market, and merchants gathered, crowding the entire market. The oil factories jointly opened for sale first, with a uniform price of 190 yuan, and retailers all purchased. Subsequently, medium-sized barrels of cooked vegetable oil were priced at 170 yuan, and large barrels were priced at 175 yuan. The Da De New Factory opened the price of raw vegetable oil at 180 yuan, and Huimin at 175 yuan. No raw oil was heard to be opened. Small barrels of sesame oil were opened at 250 yuan. The trading situation was very heated.

Soybean cake trading also resumed yesterday. The spot price was first opened at 21 yuan, and then the factory also opened, with the highest price being 22.5 yuan. About 2,300 pieces were traded.

### Tea Market Transactions are Scarce

Yesterday, tea market transactions still lacked reality, mainly because the stock was about to run out. At the same time, since the Executive Yuan approved the relaxation of price controls and implemented negotiated pricing, most goods have seen an increase in price. Therefore, those who hold goods in their hands are reluctant to let go easily, and the asking prices have risen in unison, making it difficult to achieve transactions. Looking at this situation, the future is extraordinarily brilliant.

### Cigarette Industry Dispatches Goods to the Market

Since the government lifted price controls, the Cigarette Industry Association feared market disruptions and excessive pricing. It convened an emergency meeting of its directors and supervisors yesterday, resolving to notify members to immediately dispatch goods to the market. Regarding pricing, calculations based on current raw material costs would necessitate at least a 200-300% increase. However, the association, upholding the public interest, earnestly advised members to minimize price increases as much as possible. It also notified the market that major companies, including Huacheng, Huaming, Zhonghua, Fuhua, Fuxin, Yuhua, Huamei, Nanyang, Yizhong, and Dadongnan, would be dispatching goods immediately.

### China Textile Corporation Commences Distribution Yesterday; Prices of Various Colored Cloths Rise Nearly Twofold

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market remained closed. The price of yarn and cloth from the Textile Construction Company, approved by the responsible authorities, was set at 1,800 yuan per bale for 20-count cotton yarn, more than one and a half times higher than the "August 19th" price-controlled rate.

China Textile Corporation has listed cotton cloth and is distributing it as usual. Special AB 12-pound fine cloth is priced at 62.5 yuan per bolt, limited to purchases by (dye factories). "Four Gentlemen" Yuan Biji is priced at 89.3 yuan per bolt, limited to purchases by (retail stores).

Additionally, it is reported that the negotiated price of cotton cloth has not yet been approved, and retail cloth stores remain closed. However, it is rumored that the privately-owned Rongfeng Textile Factory has announced new prices: 85 yuan per bolt for 16-pound coarse cloth, 80 yuan per bolt for 12-pound fine cloth, and 155 yuan for Jin Jiuru’s Shilin cloth.

Furthermore, it is reported that after the lifting of price controls, China Textile Corporation distributed two types of cloth at new prices for the first time, totaling 205,028 gold yuan. The approved prices were 170% higher than before. The prices of various yarns have also been approved and may be available for sale starting today. Regardless of the brand, 10-count yarn is priced at 1,223 yuan, 16-count at 1,600 yuan, 20-count at 1,800 yuan, 32-count at 2,400 yuan, 40-count at 2,735 yuan, 42-count double-ply at 3,305 yuan, Dragon Head cloth at 79.65 yuan, 20-count yarn fine cloth at 64.5 yuan, and "Four Gentlemen" Biji at 89.85 yuan.

### New Price Trading Begins for Tung Oil

Negotiated pricing for tung oil, which had been stagnant for some time, suddenly resumed on the market yesterday amid active consultations among industry members. Fully measured oil jumped to 220 yuan per dan. The price increase for West Hong Oil was slower, opening at 170 yuan per barrel, with other prices calculated accordingly. Market sentiment was stronger than before. According to industry insiders, current production prices at Yingkou are still rising steadily, reportedly reaching around 170-180 yuan per dan. Therefore, at these negotiated prices, only meager profits can be made.

### No Rice

— Mengqiu

These days, I'm even more afraid of seeing Lao Hong.

But the less I want to see him, the more likely I am to bump into him. The fact is that we're all crammed into the same big courtyard, so it's really hard to avoid each other, especially since my room and his are directly opposite each other. He has lung disease, but there are plenty of people with lung disease in this dormitory, so that's not what I'm afraid of. What I'm most afraid of is that when he sees me, he always comes over with a smile and asks:

"Hey, brother, the rationed rice is coming soon, right? When can we get it?"

I always say: "Soon, the newspaper says it should be here soon."

Every time I answer like that, I feel a pang of discomfort in my heart. Doesn't he read the newspaper every day? In fact, every morning, he waits at the door, and as soon as the newspaper delivery boy's bicycle arrives, he grabs the paper to look for news about the rice ration. But he still has to ask me. It's almost tormenting me because I can't even make my own rice last for four or five days.

Lao Hong is a low-level clerk in an unimportant government office, with a monthly salary of 48 gold yuan. If you saw his haggard face, disheveled hair, and several days' worth of stubble, you might think he was a middle-aged opium addict. He's tall and his back is hunched. He always speaks so softly. Sometimes when I walk past his door, if it's open, I often see him lying on the bed, motionless. I can't even believe he's only a 26-year-old young man this year.

Last spring, when his wife, whom he had just married last year, came from the countryside to live with him, we were all very happy, saying that Lao Hong could have someone to take care of him—who would have thought that this young woman, who was still very healthy a few months ago, would become so gaunt and sickly after a miscarriage!

These days have been really tough on Lao Hong. Others are complaining about queuing, but in our area, none of the rice shops have any rationed rice at all. For the sake of eating, let's queue then, the queue is long as it is, as long as there is a queue, there is still hope of buying. But although there are quite a few rice shops in our area, only two of them have sold rationed rice for two half days, and even that "half day" only lasted for two hours. We haven't even seen a glimpse of the five liters of rice rationed per person. People in the queue are complaining, but we're envying them for still having a queue to join!

My family sometimes goes to restaurants to eat, anyway, just to fill our stomachs, without caring about what we're eating. But Lao Hong's wife strictly adheres to the principle of living within one's means, keeping a close watch on Lao Hong's budget...

They eat large pancakes, but the pancake stalls have also closed down. They eat sweet potatoes, but sweet potatoes are also not easy to buy, and the prices are very different from a few days ago.

A kind-hearted neighbor gave Lao Hong half a basin of brown rice. She later said: Lao Hong was still smiling, but tears were streaming down his face. That neighbor herself didn't have a lot of rice stored, and she couldn't help but cry when she got home.

The place where Lao Hong works isn't very strict, but taking too much time off will still result in punishment. Their section chief has also said to Lao Hong, intentionally or unintentionally, that their department is about to downsize.

Heaven knows, Lao Hong isn't alone! But I'm more and more afraid of him. I'm afraid to see his bitter smile, I'm afraid to see his forced "nothing's wrong" expression.

Therefore, I made a decision this morning. I usually leave home at 8:45, which is the easiest time to bump into him, so today I changed it to 8:00.

Actually, it was only 7:45 when I walked out the door, because I also wanted to try my luck at the nearby stalls to see if I could get a bowl of Yangchun noodles or something. However, just as I lowered my head to walk out the door, I heard a familiar voice:

"Hey, brother, you have better information than us, when is the rice ration coming?"

I was startled. I looked up, and of course it was him. But strangely enough, there seemed to be a hint of joy on his haggard face.

Just as I was about to prevaricate, he blurted out without waiting for me to answer:

"Look, it wasn't easy! I went to queue at four in the morning and got this..."

In his hand, he was holding about half a pound of gray-black raw noodles. I wanted to advise him to take better care of his health, but my throat seemed to be blocked. I smiled and urged him to go back quickly and eat a bowl of hot noodles before going to work. He also smiled, coughing violently. He waved goodbye, and I hurriedly walked away.

Half a pound of noodles for two people, four ounces each, is that the food for the whole day? Thinking of this, I had already reached the tram stop.

### In Memory of Mr. Chen Shuren

— Zhang Yiqu

We met and became friends over wine by the Yangtze and Han Rivers, never realizing our connection was destined. You were called the master of poetry, and your spiritual likeness on stone was like that of Su Shi (I casually painted ink bamboo, and you added rocks). You were still on the moonlit bamboo forest path, but the tide dimmed in Lychee Bay. In autumn, feelings of grief for you and your zither are endless, and the crickets cry in the hall, bidding a faint farewell.

My thoughts are filled with sorrow for the overseas land, the news of your death was delayed by wind and rain (Mr. Chen passed away on October 4th of this year, and I only received the obituary from the Chen residence in Guangzhou on the 8th of the same month). You were a respected elder of the era, and your noble demeanor will be admired for centuries. Like you, one should be at peace with oneself! Who in the world would not support you? You left us with the purity of both plum blossoms and bamboo, and the New Year's poem and painting (Mr. Chen inscribed his "Purity of Plum Blossoms and Bamboo" painting with the line "New Year's poems and paintings to welcome the year").

### Remembering Hengtang

— Xihou

Hengtang is a small town in Suzhou. It is not considered a famous scenic spot, as evidenced by the fact that tour groups do not include it in their sightseeing programs. But like Maple Bridge, it often shines in the poems of previous generations, and seems to have a connection with women, thus carrying a bit of a romantic air. Its origin, to speak more recently, is probably related to the Tang Dynasty poet Cui Hao's line in "Changgan Ballad": "My concubine lives in Hengtang."

Like many historical sites, I first experienced the atmosphere of Hengtang on paper, and then experienced it in person. It was on the evening of the same day when I passed Maple Bridge, as mentioned earlier, that I spent the night in Hengtang. Looking far across Rainbow Cloud Bridge, I saw the yellow bridge pavilion, the sound of the bells on the corners of the pavilion, scattered in the wind. The boatman pointed out that these bells were not the original ones. The original sound of the bells could be heard thirty miles away in Taihu Lake, but the Japanese had taken them away. I don't know if that's believable. But this time I only heard about searching for the ancient bell of Hanshan Temple, and not about returning the ancient bell of Hengtang. Although giving up the small to seek the big, it is still disappointing.

That time I went to Hengtang, I passed through the bridge, and there were Buddhist statues in the bridge pavilion, with flickering incense, so the pavilion was painted yellow, to resemble the walls of a temple. The streets on both sides were narrow, the sound of oars and voices of people, a desolate waterside town. It was just a brief night, and there was nothing to linger for. It was later, when I occasionally wrote about dormitory life, that I had the line "The sound of rain fills the room and I sleep in my clothes, just like mooring in Hengtang at night."

Hengtang is not far from Xumen, and can be reached on foot, but usually boats are taken. As you approach the town, several chimneys rise up in the distance, which are the lime kilns in the town starting to work. If there is a good wind, it will also bring sparse bell sounds. Then the yellow ferry pavilion comes into view. When the boat enters the middle bridge hole, raise your head and say "Hengtang Ancient Ferry", as if you have already read many poems and stories about Hengtang.

I remember in the spring sixteen years ago, I took a "clang-clang boat" (a boat that attracts customers by knocking on a small gong) with a friend to play at Mudu. Suddenly I had a feeling in the boat and left behind a "Dian Jiang Chun" poem: "Small oars, light boat, I ask if you live in Hengtang? The green eyebrows are silent, I am afraid that you will leave on the waves. By which bridge is the parting place. Flowers are ownerless, spring breeze road, a burst like red rain." Old friends who traveled with me have long since vanished with the "green eyebrows" and "red rain".

Except for sweeping tombs and hiking in the mountains, and stopping to rest along the way, it is rare to visit Hengtang specially. Who knew that once the war started, the front lines shifted inwards, and to avoid the enemy, I had to leave and travel elsewhere. Passing through Hengtang, ah! Hengtang had changed its face. The lime kilns were broken, the chimneys no longer released smoke, the ferry pavilion was still there, but the incense was extinguished. The river water had been turbid for a long time, and few boats were seen. Occasionally, there were shadows of people lurking among the sparse trees and dilapidated houses. The scene was desolate and heartbreaking. I had no choice but to quicken my pace and pass by in a glance. This year, when searching through my old boxes, I found a poem I had written at the time to express my feelings, "Zhe Gu Tian": "A piece of Hengtang ripples into words, I don't know if it's tears or rouge! Don't stop the boat to ask about the wind and waves, the concubine has no family and few traces. Endless hate, who knows it? At the ferry, sobbing for a long time: The setting sun and flowing water are not mine, all given to military songs and horse neighs."

In the past twelve years, I have not set foot in Maple Bridge or Hengtang again, let alone the sights of Tianping and Qionglong. Yesterday I went out of Xumen, stood for a while on the bridge, facing the bay of green water, and recited the line "Hengtang is lost in small boats, how is the scenery now"? I felt quite lost. I am especially concerned about the lost ancient bell of the ferry. When will it be able to return to its homeland with the ancient bell of Hanshan, I will definitely sail on the Five Lakes, and listen to the bell sound pouring out the accumulated sorrows among the vast smoke and waves.

### Ancestors and Descendants

— Song Xian

Japanese author Katoh Hiroshi said: "All people once had parents, and the father also had parents, and the mother also had parents, that is, grandparents, a total of four people. Grandparents also had their own parents, a total of sixteen people, that is, great-grandparents. In this way, it increases geometrically to thirty-two people, sixty-four people, one hundred and twenty-eight people... If thirty years is taken as one generation, then ten generations in three hundred years have one thousand and twenty-four ancestors; twenty generations in six hundred years have one million forty-eight thousand five hundred and seventy-six ancestors; thirty generations in nine hundred years have one billion forty million one hundred seventy-four thousand one hundred eighty-four ancestors; thirty-three generations have three billion three hundred thirty-three million nine hundred thirty-four thousand five hundred ninety-two people. The number of ancestors increases gradually, so the number of ancestors in thousands of years can only be expressed by astronomical figures."

Madame Maite-McFane in France had a child in the first year of her marriage, twins in the second year, three children in the third year, four in the fourth year, five in the fifth, and six in the sixth year. She died unfortunately from dystocia in the seventh year.

When Thomas Bock of New York City, USA, died, he had 658 descendants.

Lukas Jofen of Jahrburg, Germany, was born in 1612 and died in 1679. He had five sons, eighty-seven grandchildren, four hundred and forty-six great-grandchildren, and five hundred and fifty-three great-great-grandchildren. His family thrived for five generations, which can be said to have created the world's highest record.

### Snippets of Japan

— Sun Jichang

The first sight of Yokohama, what struck me was the forest of factory chimneys. Now it's like a forest in spring, sprouting and growing leaves, thriving.

When going ashore for a short visit, one must abide by the rules promulgated by the US military, such as: only one opened pack of cigarettes or two cigars are allowed; one pack of chewing gum or one bar of candy; no US dollars are allowed, and Japanese yen must be exchanged at the designated US military finance office, and an "exchange certificate" must be kept for verification, otherwise it will be considered illegally obtained, and if goods are purchased, it will be considered an illegal transaction, punishable by a fine for minor offenses and imprisonment for up to six months for serious offenses; most shops, hotels, theaters, hospitals, hostels and public places are Off Limit (restricted areas), and one cannot enter Japanese homes after eleven o'clock at night; landing is not allowed to exceed twenty-four hours, etc. But the US military has also learned the officialdom's way of doing things.

Japanese people's clothing is all old and worn, but a large number of Japanese woolens have been discovered in Hong Kong, passing off as something else to compete with British and American products in the market.

Several colleagues were strolling on the streets of Kawasaki when two or three Japanese children made gun gestures with their hands, aimed, and then said "Bang, bang" several times. My colleagues actually just smiled bitterly.

Japanese yen was tricked out using cigarettes, but then they tricked the things back. In Tokyo and Yokohama, after spending a lot of time and running around a lot of shops, I couldn't find any American goods. All there was were a few old cameras.

The Yawata steel mill kept me running for several hours without finding the gate. I invited three "pilots" to eat a simple meal on the ship. They were very grateful, saying that they would never forget this delicious meal in three years.

Only when sitting in a carriage exclusively for UN military and civilians did I feel a slight taste of the privileges of a victorious country. (Sent from Yawata on October 20, 1948)

### Dog Penis and Diving Beetles

— Chen Yixian

The "Records of the Grand Historian, Biography of Jing Ke" states that when Jing Ke traveled to Yan, he befriended Gao Jianli, a dog butcher in the Yan market. Fan Kuai, also a dog butcher, assisted Emperor Gao of Han in establishing his empire. This shows that from the Warring States period to the Han Dynasty, dog meat was a common food for the people. Later, it is unknown in what era, pork gradually became popular, and people ate beef and mutton, but no longer used dog meat as a side dish. However, people in Guangdong and Guangxi still preserve the ancient custom, regarding dog meat as a delicacy. They do not use knives to kill dogs. Several days before inviting guests, they hang the dog by its hind legs in the air, starving it to death, and then cook it. There is a saying that "yellow is first, black is second, and spotted is third," meaning that yellow dogs are the best quality. When I was over ten years old and living in Wuchang, I suffered from malaria. At that time, I did not know about the special effects of quinine. The alternating chills and fever lasted for two months before stopping. I was extremely weak. Someone said that dog meat could cure malaria, so my family bought dog meat to stew and eat. I ate it two or three times and only felt my body heat up after eating it. The meat was not difficult to eat, but I didn't think it was particularly delicious either.

In the early years of the Republic, when I was in the old capital, I heard a friend say that he was invited to a banquet by Lu Rongting. Lu's adjutant came beforehand to declare, "The general did not bring many dogs, and Zhang Dingwu (i.e., Zhang Junmai) took one a few days ago, please forgive us." My friend heard this and did not understand its meaning. When the banquet arrived, my friend was seated in the second position. After the cold dishes and stir-fries, the main dish was served, which was dog meat. A separate plate was placed in front of the first seat (Guo Zidian, then Secretary-General of the State Council), containing an object about one inch long, black in color, which was the dog's penis. Observing the host's solemn speech, one could know the value of this item. My friend then suddenly understood the adjutant's statement, because there were eight or nine guests at the table, and this special dish only had one, so he asked my friend to forgive him.

Diving beetles are small insects that can swim in water and fly out of water. They live in the wetlands of rural villages and, like osmanthus cicadas, are a nourishing snack for the people of Guangdong after autumn. The first time I tasted this food was at the residence of the famous courtesan Xiao Hong Lao Si. Xiao Hong claimed to be the daughter of Cai Naihuang, and was known as Miss Cai Si. Around 1921 in the Jufu Troupe in Shaanxi Alley in the old capital, she occupied nine rooms alone and was the most popular prostitute at the time. Friends nicknamed her, and I often went to her place. One day, Chen Feigong had a big fight with her, and I helped to mediate, so Xiao Hong was grateful to me. In 1924, I resigned from my position at the Ministry of Education's Compilation and Review Office and returned south, living on the lake. One day in the spring of 1925, I was drinking old wine with two or three friends at Chen Zhenghe's roadside stall in Qixia Camp. Suddenly, a chartered car came from the north at dusk, with four water-moon electric lights shining brightly on people. I went to the sidewalk to watch. A woman sitting in the car looked familiar. Just as I was dazed, there was a "ding-dong" sound, and the car stopped briefly. The woman said, "Are you Mr. Chen Si? Please come to the West Lake Hotel to play." She still spoke with a very good Beijing accent. After speaking, she waved her right hand, and the chartered car sped away. I then remembered that it was Xiao Hong Lao Si. I visited her late at night. Xiao Hong brought out brandy to drink together. There was another plate of snacks, which were black insects. I dared not eat them. Xiao Hong said that these were Guangdong diving beetles, which were most fragrant when stir-fried. I took one to taste, and it did indeed have a unique flavor, so I devoured it. Dog penis and diving beetles are both delicacies favored by the people of Guangdong. The two items are both black when prepared, so I recorded them together. (Xiao Hong was the "President of the Flower Kingdom" in Shanghai at the time, and her boudoir was located west of the Great World. People over fifty years old who have been to brothels must know about her.)
