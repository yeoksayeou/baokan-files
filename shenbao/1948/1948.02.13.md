### Reduced Imports in the Fifth and Sixth Seasons: Quota Schedule to be Announced Together Today; This Unified Control is Solely for Saving Foreign Exchange

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The import quotas for the fifth and sixth seasons will be announced together on the 13th. According to a report submitted by the Import Control Committee to the National Economic Council on the 12th, the principle behind compiling this quota schedule is purely to save foreign exchange. There are four reasons for announcing the fifth and sixth seasons simultaneously: (1) The government faces foreign exchange difficulties and must conserve it. The quotas after conservation will undoubtedly fall far short of the needs of industry and commerce, making ordering difficult and easily leading to misunderstandings, creating psychological panic, and affecting prices. Therefore, the two seasons are being announced together. (2) Announcing them together allows for the allocation of months based on priority, preventing difficulties in foreign exchange allocation. (3) The combined total for the fifth and sixth seasons is on average 17% lower than that of the fourth season. (4) After the combined announcement of the two-season quotas, the committee plans to require gradual reporting of price fluctuations when most industrial raw materials obtained through these quota foreign exchanges are processed into goods and sold in the market, in order to facilitate control.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Import Control Committee has already drafted the allocation schedule for the fifth and sixth season import quotas and submitted it to the National Economic Council for discussion on the 12th. After over an hour of detailed deliberation, the quota allocations have been largely determined, but a small portion still needs slight adjustments. The meeting decided to hand it over to a subcommittee for review. Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Huo Baoshu, Jian Guansan, and others, seven in total, were appointed as review committee members, with Wang Yunwu appointed as convener. A subcommittee meeting is scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 13th for review. Once the review decision is made, it will not need to go through the National Economic Council again and can be submitted to President Zhang Qun for approval, with announcement at 3:00 PM. A key feature of the fifth and sixth season quota allocation is that it is reduced by 15 million US dollars compared to the fourth season. The total for the fourth season was over 53.3 million US dollars, while the fifth season is only over 30 million US dollars. The sixth season is roughly the same as the fifth, but the allocation numbers for cotton, wheat, and automobiles are still undetermined. During the discussion on the 12th, committee members offered many opinions on the quota allocation. Wang Yunwu advocated for a reduction in gasoline imports because, based on the conservation plan, there were restrictions on the use of private cars. He stated that if gasoline imports were too high, it would contradict the principles of the conservation plan and should therefore be reduced. Wang also advocated for relaxing the import quota for newsprint because Shanghai's paper production increase plan was not providing immediate relief, and current newspaper sales were soaring, often making past newsprint allocations insufficient. He argued that the government should support cultural undertakings and that relaxing the newsprint import quota was necessary. Jian Guansan put forward three points: A: The allocation of import quotas should reflect the direction of foreign exchange policy and should align with the ten self-help plans proposed by President Zhang. B: The quota allocation schedule should be arranged according to priority, without inverting the order of importance. Additions and reductions should be explained simply. C: The five items with unspecified numbers should still be listed, and it should be stipulated that cars cannot be imported. Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, and others also spoke. Zuo advocated for increasing fertilizer imports, and Chen also stressed increasing the import of machinery and raw materials. After lengthy discussion, apart from the majority that had been decided, the remainder was handed over to the subcommittee for decision on the 13th. Two principles were finalized on the 12th: A: The total value of quotas should be reduced compared to the fourth season, and the allocation of quotas should align with the conservation plan and the ten self-help plans proposed by Zhang Qun. On the 13th, concrete measures will be formulated based on the above two principles.

### Government to Adopt Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices in Various Regions; Separate Detailed Regulations to be Formulated for Foreign Investment in Factories

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The National Economic Council held its 34th regular meeting at 3:00 PM on the 12th. Chairman Zhang Qun began with a report by Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuqun on the price situation in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin over the past week. Generally speaking, grain prices in all three locations have fluctuated, with the sharpest price increase in Hankou, followed by Shanghai, and the least in Tianjin. The reason is that it is the end of the year, and merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices. The government is currently working on countermeasures and will take measures to stabilize prices. It is believed that after the implementation of rationed grain sales starting on March 1st, grain prices can be expected to improve. The discussion then began on (1) the matter of welcoming foreign investment in China to establish factories, which was handed over to the competent authorities to formulate detailed regulations based on the first phase of economic construction principles, the Company Law, and the Mining Law. The content will re-explain the welcome for foreign investment in China to establish factories and provide special convenience to foreign businesses. President Zhang had previously expressed this in detail in August of last year. After the statement welcoming foreign investment in China to establish factories was released, five foreign companies came to China to register with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and apply to establish factories. Chambers of Commerce in various parts of China have suggested to the government that there should be certain regulations regarding foreign investment in factories. This was brought up for discussion at the National Economic Council on the 12th. Zhang Qun also spoke on this matter, saying that there had already been an explanation in the past, and there was no need to make separate regulations. Detailed regulations could be formulated by the competent authorities. (2) The fifth and sixth season import quota schedule (see separate article) was handed over to Wang Yunwu and the other seven people to convene a subcommittee meeting at 10:00 AM on the 13th for review. (3) The implementation measures for the financial portion of the economic reform plan were amended and passed (implementation measures were already reported in this newspaper on January 17th and 18th). In the original plan, sections (A) regarding the raising of domestic debt and (B) regarding the borrowing of foreign debt in the sixth implementation measure were deleted, and their implementation measures will be planned separately at an appropriate time. The original plan (7), which prioritized allowing people to purchase foreign exchange from the Central Bank with gold for the purpose of buying permitted imported goods, was entirely deleted. This is because the emergency economic measures promulgated in February of last year are still being implemented, and gold cannot be used as currency, so it cannot be used to purchase permitted imported goods. These implementation measures were changed to be planned separately at an appropriate time. Regarding the stabilization of the monetary system, the original plan (5) stated that the government should allow people to use gold to purchase government-sold state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet industries in order to increase the reserve of legal tender, but these implementation measures were entirely deleted and will be planned separately at an appropriate time. The three points in the implementation measures at the conclusion of the economic plan's implementation measures were also entirely deleted. (3) The State-Owned Enterprise Management Law was entrusted to Pan Xulun and Gu Yuqun to formulate measures and draft implementation details, which will be completed within a week.

### Economic Reform Plan

Implementation Measures Fully Discussed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The implementation measures for the economic reform plan were fully discussed by the National Economic Council on the 12th. The entire economic reform plan and implementation measures have been completed and will be sent by the National Economic Council to the Executive Yuan after the text is finalized, and then submitted by the Executive Yuan to the State Council for approval, after which they can be implemented. When the National Economic Council completed the discussion of the implementation measures on the 12th, President Zhang Qun stood up and spoke, narrating the process of drafting the economic reform plan and emphasizing that it should be implemented as soon as possible. President Zhang said that the economic reform plan was originally proposed by the Kuomintang, but after he took over the Executive Yuan, feeling the importance of economic reform, he modified the plan proposed by the Kuomintang and submitted it to the State Council for instructions. First, the State Council handed it over to the National Economic Council for review, and after the review, it was passed by the State Council. After much effort, there is now the entire plan and implementation measures. Currently, due to military and other reasons, the internal implementation of the economic plan is not without difficulties, but anything that can be implemented will be implemented as soon as possible. Zhang also specifically instructed that the self-help plans he proposed are all interconnected with the economic reform plan's implementation measures. The implementation of the ten self-help plans is achieved through the economic reform plan's implementation measures. Therefore, after the entire plan and implementation measures are presented to the State Council for review, they will be implemented as soon as possible.

### Yu Youren Acknowledges Considering Running for Vice President

No Intention to Continue as President of the Control Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the issue of the current President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, considering running for Vice President, he has been considering it. When Yu was asked about this by reporters, he answered with an extremely open attitude, saying, "I absolutely do not want others to fail in their election, but I hope even more that I will succeed in my election."

Yu expressed that he does not intend to continue in the position of President of the Control Yuan, saying, "After the implementation of the Constitution, the number of members of the Control Yuan will increase, and their powers will be strengthened, which will further deepen the influence on politics.

### US Restricts Export Trade, Prioritizing Domestic Supply to Stabilize Prices; Ministry of Economic Affairs Studies Impact on China

[Report from our Nanjing office, 12th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently received a report from the commercial counselor's office at our embassy in the United States, stating that the US Department of Commerce's Office of International Trade recently convened commercial counselors or other representatives from embassies and legations of various countries in the United States to announce a new export licensing policy. The purpose of this policy is to uphold the principle of competitive private trade by issuing export licenses as a means to prioritize domestic needs, stabilize domestic prices, and reduce foreign exchange demands. The controlled export items include over 400 types in the first batch. This will have a significant impact on China's import and export trade. In the future, China's import of essential materials from the United States will be further restricted. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently studying the matter in detail and will soon convene representatives from relevant ministries to discuss appropriate measures.

[Report from our Nanjing office, 12th] Regarding the accusations from tung oil manufacturers in the southern United States that Chinese merchants are dumping tung oil in the US at prices far below actual production costs, and reports that US customs will investigate Chinese tung oil prices, import methods, and production conditions, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made a defense. It is indeed true that due to exchange rate issues, the legal tender (fabi) obtained by general exporters after settlement is often lower than the fabi cost. However, this is a temporary and exceptional situation under foreign exchange policies, and not something that merchants desire, especially not limited to tung oil alone. As for the supply of tung oil, China is virtually the only major exporting country in the world and does not face fierce competition from other countries. If conditions allow, China only wishes to see international tung oil prices rise; why would we engage in dumping? Furthermore, tung oil exporters rarely engage in domestic sales, making it difficult to constitute dumping. The foreign accusations are purely based on their own private interests and a lack of understanding of China's current foreign exchange management and foreign trade regulations, resulting in a case of putting the cart before the horse.

### Marshall Declares at Press Conference that Aid to China Awaits Presidential Decision; Representative Judd Accuses Secretary Marshall of Obstructing Aid to China

[US Information Service, Washington, 11th] Secretary of State Marshall told reporters on the 11th that the $570 million aid-to-China plan has been received from the National Advisory Council, which is responsible for studying financial issues, and is ready for final consideration by the Bureau of the Budget and the President. When asked if this included military aid, the Secretary of State replied that it was an economic proposal, but stated that the proposal would not interfere with the Chinese government's freedom of action.

[United Press, Peoria, Illinois, 11th] Republican Congressman Judd, speaking last night at the Citizens Association, accused Secretary of State Marshall of "obstructing" aid to China and urged immediate aid to China to prevent it from falling into communist hands. He stated: "Mr. Marshall's job is difficult, almost impossible. He is a great patriot, but not a great Secretary of State. We need someone with foresight and talent in diplomacy, different from what is cultivated by intelligence and military training. Asia now balances the two major armed camps of the US and the USSR. The United States needs China more than China needs the United States. China may be able to survive after the demise of communism, but this highly organized and fragile Western civilization cannot."

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] The Pacific Affairs' bi-weekly "Far Eastern Survey" published for the first time an article expressing support for US aid to China. The article, titled "The Issue of Aid to China," was written by Professor Lindbergh, who presented four major reasons for aid: Politically, there is no other legitimate channel to provide aid besides the Chinese government. Currently, there are only two major groups in China, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, with no hope for a third force to emerge. US public opinion and politics would not support the Communist Party, so the target of aid must be the Nanjing Nationalist government, and aid to China is also consistent with Roosevelt's policies. Roosevelt's policies are divided into two aspects: (1) An inner circle alliance with all non-communist democratic countries within the outer circle alliance with anti-fascist countries, which is what Truman is currently implementing. (2) Recognizing the Soviet sphere of influence, as Lippmann said. Practically speaking, providing aid through the Nationalist government is feasible. Wedemeyer has more experience than anyone else and is confident in the effectiveness of this aid. From a humanitarian perspective, aid to China is the best way to end the war south of the Yellow River and stabilize wars in other regions; otherwise, the Chinese civil strife will inevitably extend abroad.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The State Department announced today that the implementation plan for the $18 million relief fund for China after the end of UNRRA will be finalized soon and announced this weekend. Congress passed the second aid-to-China plan after the end of UNRRA during a special session last December.

### On This Year's National Budget (Part Two)

— Zhang Baiyi

   Not patterned, overgrown  The national banking system absorbs fixed deposits The greater such as follows:

(1) The Ministry of Finance and the Four Allied Banking Organizations and the Central Bank will jointly form a fixed deposit absorption planning committee.

(2) The Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, together with the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, will issue special preferential short-term national treasury savings bonds, such as the Savings Bonds and National Savings Certificates issued by the British Treasury during the war, with a term of one year and a monthly interest rate of 1.5%. The issuance amount will be at least 10 trillion yuan.

(3) National banks and treasury departments will jointly issue special savings deposit certificates, divided into three-month, six-month, and one-year terms, with monthly interest rates of 10%, 1.5%, and 20% respectively. For three-month and six-month terms, interest can be deducted in advance. The face value will be divided into 1 million, 5 million, and 10 million yuan, thereby absorbing small savings. The issuance amount will be 20 trillion yuan.

(4) The Ministry of Finance will entrust the Central Trust Bureau to handle enemy and puppet properties, including jewelry and illicit assets of Chinese traitors that have been confiscated by the state, by issuing savings lottery tickets. This will be completed in cooperation with the Central Savings Association of the Bureau and the enemy and puppet property liquidation offices in various regions. Each time lottery tickets are issued, 10 million tickets will be issued, with each ticket priced at 50,000 yuan. It is estimated that savings deposits of 6 trillion yuan can be absorbed throughout the year.

(5) The existing group profit-sharing savings deposits of the Central Savings Association of the Central Trust Bureau will continue to be processed, but the deposit amount and bonus amount can be appropriately increased by one to two times to increase the absorption of fixed deposits.

(6) The special prize-winning savings bonds issued by the Central Savings Association of the Central Trust Bureau during the war have been discontinued after the end of the war. However, in order to absorb savings, they can also continue to be processed, with 5 million numbers issued each period and each number priced at 100,000 yuan. The top prize will be increased to 1 billion yuan. In this way, 6 trillion yuan in fixed savings can be absorbed each year. However, the principal repayment period should be shortened from ten years to three years.

(7) Before implementing currency reform, the Ministry of Finance should make a statement of preferential treatment for depositors in national banks and treasury departments; for ordinary deposits in national banks and treasury departments held by the people for more than six months, the exchange rate to the new currency will be reduced by 50% or 30% for deposit amounts below 10 million yuan compared to the ordinary exchange rate. This can increase small savings and also prevent imbalances in the distribution of national wealth due to currency reform, and can accelerate the stabilization of the current currency situation and facilitate currency reform.

(8) The Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Audit Office of the Central Bank should cooperate to strengthen the audit of the receipts and disbursements of funds of government agencies (including all state-owned enterprises and national schools). If it is discovered that funds are withdrawn from the depository bank and transferred to commercial banks for profit, payment will be immediately suspended to the agency in question.

    China's Such as above. If the government can truly act in this way, then it is deeply believed that the fixed deposits and national savings of national banks and treasury departments will be greatly increased. At the same time, the national treasury can also absorb a portion of savings and at least reduce some of the annual debt. If the people can understand the government and actively support these extraordinary financial measures, just like the spirit of the Soviet and British people buying public bonds in large quantities within a few days during the war, then most of the people's purchasing power can still be controlled by national banks and treasury departments as before the war. Prices will immediately stabilize, the currency will gradually restore its credit due to price stability, and the people's interest in saving will gradually be restored. As a result, both the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit.

The third question is whether the current system for tax collection and treasury fund receipts and disbursements is sound. This point is extremely important. We should know that if both government revenue and expenditure are subject to corruption, then revenue will be smaller and expenditure will be greater, resulting in an increase in the deficit. We certainly cannot suspect that all the civil servants in the entire tax system of the Ministry of Finance are corrupt, nor can we suspect that all the clerical staff in government agencies at all levels and all state-owned enterprises and national schools that rely on national treasury funds are corrupt, but we also cannot guarantee that there is absolutely no such phenomenon. The passive purpose of the Public Treasury Law promulgated and implemented by the National Government in 1938 was to prevent this phenomenon.

However, since the later period of the War of Resistance, government expenditures have actually been declining step by step, and market prices have been rising daily under the manipulation of speculators. The living standards of civil servants have gradually declined, and the trend of decline has not stopped even today. Precisely because of this, the Public Treasury Law cannot achieve its perfect purpose. The author does not need to cite many examples. The recent corruption in two major agencies in Shanghai is enough to show the existence and danger of this fact. Analyzing our national character, most politicians have always been honest and self-disciplined, and the virtue of thrift among the people has also been a traditional spirit for thousands of years. The reason why this phenomenon occurs is, on the one hand, due to the imperfection of the system, and on the other hand, the decline in the living standards of civil servants. Therefore, the author suggests that the living treatment of civil servants must be reasonably improved, as mentioned earlier. At the same time, there should be technical reforms in the system.

First, let's discuss the tax collection system. According to the Public Treasury Law, tax officials can avoid directly receiving cash, but in reality, tax collectors and taxpayers often collude in corruption. For example, if the tax amount should be 100 million yuan, the tax collector can reduce it to 30 million yuan at the request of the taxpayer, and half of the 70 million yuan not paid by the taxpayer is pocketed by the tax collector. As a result, the national treasury actually receives only 30 million yuan, while the remaining 70 million yuan is sacrificed to the corruption of both parties. In order to prevent the corruption that may occur, we must strive to change the collection system. According to the author's research, during this extraordinary period, extraordinary measures should be used. It is best to establish a unified industrial and commercial tax on the central system of coarse taxes and abolish all existing taxes involving industry and commerce at the same time. Based on the commercial prosperity index of various regions across the country, and stipulate a fixed amount of unified commercial business tax, directly entrusted by the Ministry of Finance to the national industrial and commercial law firms. The method of collection is only to notify local industrial associations or chambers of commerce by the national industrial and commercial law firms, and then local industrial associations or chambers of commerce will notify various industrial and commercial trade associations, and then various industrial and commercial trade associations will notify various factories and shops to automatically pay the prescribed tax amount directly to the local depository banks or financial institutions acting as depositories. This method is limited to extraordinary periods. Once the suppression of the rebellion is over, the original system will be restored. There are many advantages to collecting this unified industrial and commercial business tax: (1) It can avoid corruption; (2) It is simple and convenient for citizens to pay taxes; (3) It promotes the spirit of paying taxes as a national duty; (4) It reduces government collection costs. According to the author's rough calculation, if the government implements this unified industrial and commercial business tax, the national treasury can receive an annual income of 30 trillion to 50 trillion yuan.

Regarding the system of treasury fund receipts and disbursements, in terms of the system, there seems to be no problem due to the existence of the Public Treasury Law. However, in fact, according to Articles 4 and 5 of the Public Treasury Law, government agencies at all levels can independently manage and receive and disburse funds within a certain amount. Therefore, in fact, agencies at all levels have not been able to eliminate all corruption in receipts and disbursements. However, it would certainly be difficult if all receipts and disbursements had to go through the depository bank. As of today, it is believed that very few clerical units of various agencies are completely honest and self-disciplined. For major building repairs and large-scale material purchases, or large-scale printing expenditures, although there are bidding regulations and auditors dispatched by the Audit Department to supervise, in fact, the bidders are often the same person or there is only one bidder. When the author worked in a certain agency, the bidders for building repairs were the same person dozens of times, which was suspected by colleagues but was also an open secret. Therefore, the bidding system is merely a formality. The author firmly believes that a considerable amount of money is inevitably wasted on corruption in the clerical expenditures of government agencies at all levels.

According to the author's research, the persons in charge of general affairs or clerical units of agencies at all levels must have profound knowledge and a revolutionary mindset. At the same time, the person in charge of the agency must absolutely avoid employing relatives as the head of clerical affairs. In this way, if corruption or other matters are discovered one day, they can be immediately transferred to the court.

Fourth, regarding public debt policy. Since the legal tender (fabi) became unstable, bank deposits have flowed out in large quantities and directly or indirectly become speculative funds in the market. The phenomenon of freely purchasing public bonds can be said to be non-existent. On the one hand, this is due to the low level of national education and patriotism, and on the other hand, it is because the rate of price increases exceeds the natural rate of issuance increases by about ten times. Therefore, people have become uninterested in public bonds. Precisely because the public bond policy cannot be thoroughly used, the speed of inflation is further deepened. Therefore, the author believes that the public bond policy must be continued to be used under these difficulties. However, there is no need to issue public bonds in US dollar or British pound units, because these public bonds affect the credit of the fabi itself and also increase the burden on the government's treasury, and the people may not welcome them very much. The author now suggests that the government issue a type of prize-winning public bond (Zinsenlotterie or Praemienanlehen). The unit of the public bond is still the fabi, with 100,000 yuan as one share and 1 million yuan as one full sheet. Each full sheet has a number. Drawings are held once a month, with 10 million numbers issued each month, or 10,000 full sheets, totaling 10 trillion yuan. Ten percent of this is set aside for prize money, which is 1 trillion yuan. The distribution is as follows:

First prize One ticket 100 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan

Second prize Two tickets 50 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan

Third prize Four tickets 25 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan

Fourth prize Eight tickets 12.5 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan

Fifth prize Twenty tickets 5 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan

Sixth prize One hundred tickets 1 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan

Seventh prize One thousand tickets 100 million yuan Total 100 billion yuan

Eighth prize Ten thousand tickets 10 million yuan Total 100 billion yuan

Ninth prize One hundred thousand tickets 2 million yuan Total 200 billion yuan

Total number of winning tickets: 111,135 Total prize amount: 1 trillion yuan

The prize-winning public bond is an interest-free public bond. The principal repayment period is ten years. If currency reform occurs during the ten years, it will be converted according to the new currency and will receive the same preferential treatment as bank deposits. Winning lottery tickets will no longer be repaid. If the government accepts this suggestion, the government can absorb 120 trillion yuan of idle funds annually through prize-winning public bonds. After deducting prize money of 12 trillion yuan and other printing, paper, transportation, and handling costs, there will still be 100 trillion yuan left. On the one hand, it can stabilize finance by absorbing a large amount of idle funds, and on the other hand, it can also repay all the domestic debts issued during and before the war (including public bonds in foreign currency units), which will be discussed later. Because this type of prize-winning public bond has a gambling nature, it should not be used frequently. However, the author believes that during this extraordinary period, using this extraordinary method is still a good fiscal policy. The participation of finance in the national economy and financial market is also required by the emerging theory of fiscal science.

Fifth, regarding income from state-owned property. Before and during the war, income from state-owned property was originally insignificant in terms of finance. However, since the end of the war, due to the confiscation of enemy and puppet property and the donation and low-price purchase of US surplus materials, this state-owned property will theoretically be an important source of revenue in finance. A portion of the enemy factories was nationalized and converted into state-owned enterprises. Therefore, the main income from enemy and puppet property should be the illicit assets of Chinese traitors. However, in fact, many Chinese traitors have been dealt with, but most have not yet been dealt with. The reason for this is that the procedures for dealing with Chinese traitors in ordinary judicial organs are too slow. Two and a half years have passed since the end of the war, but very few Chinese traitors have been finally sentenced. The crimes of most Chinese traitors have not yet been determined, resulting in the inability of enemy and puppet property handling agencies to handle them.

According to the Central Trust Bureau's enemy and puppet property liquidation office in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, the office was established in December 1945 and received enemy and puppet property worth 1,202.477 billion yuan from its inception to December 1946, of which 520.155 billion yuan has been processed and 682.79 billion yuan has not been processed. In addition, there are 498,731 liang, 6 qian, 9 fen, and 7 li of gold in the Central Bank. Because its valuation is still in December 1946, and some of the property and materials were estimated in 1945, there is a need to study its valuation. For example, the approximately 498,732 liang of gold stored in the Central Bank is worth about 5 trillion yuan at today's market price. As far as the author knows, most of the precious jewelry, diamonds, jade, gems, pearls, etc. of Chinese traitors have not yet been processed. According to today's market price, it has increased at least 100 times compared to the original valuation. Therefore, the unprocessed enemy and puppet property of 682.79 billion yuan can be increased to at least 68.279 trillion yuan at today's market price. Many have been processed in the middle of last year, but there are still some hidden properties of enemy and puppet properties that have been discovered after being reported confidentially. Therefore, according to the author's rough estimate, if all enemy and puppet properties nationwide can be processed this year, the national treasury's income can be expected to be 100 trillion yuan. However, this state-owned property is being shelved due to the government's various departments not being able to closely cooperate, and some important economic traitors are being released or acquitted, or will still be returned by the enemy and puppet property handling agencies. If the current situation continues to be delayed, the income from state-owned property in last year's national budget is feared to still fall short. The most numerous among Chinese traitors are economic traitors. The purpose of economic traitors is to absorb the people's wealth and indulge in enjoyment. It is unwise not to sentence these traitors severely, and it is even more inconceivable to release them casually or even acquit them due to the personal relationships of a few high-ranking officials! I recall that Chairman Jiang of the National Government had the following instructions at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee: "In the future, the War of Resistance will emphasize both military and economic aspects. The decisive force of the future success or failure of the enemy and us will be 70% economic and 30% military." This is enough to prove the importance of the economic position during the Sino-Japanese War. Japan is quite lacking in resources, so it proposed the slogan of "using war to support war," the purpose of which is to use the Chinese economy to invade China. If economic traitors are its pawns, then their crime should be equal to military traitors and political traitors.

Recalling that on September 3, 1941, the National Government promulgated the "Regulations on Prohibiting the Transportation of Materials to the Enemy," which stipulates in Article 1: "The investigation, prohibition, and handling of domestic materials transported to the enemy shall be governed by the provisions of these Regulations"; Article 11 stipulates: "If the smuggled goods are sold to the enemy and the facts are verified, the penalty shall be death or life imprisonment." Also, Article 29 of the "Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Industry, Mining, and Commerce in Extraordinary Times" promulgated by the National Government on October 6, 1938, also stipulates: "Those who supply raw materials or goods to the enemy shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for seven years or more." It can be seen that the National Government had already established the principle of law for punishing economic traitors, that is, all economic traitors should be sentenced to at least seven years of imprisonment. By 1941, in view of the importance of economic traitors to the war, it was amended to at least life imprisonment. Therefore, these traitors do not need to be tried by the court for a long time. Those with solid evidence should be sentenced to at least life imprisonment in the first instance, and even if the sentence is reduced, it should be at least seven years of imprisonment. The author suggests that all traitor cases must be judged in full this year. Those with solid evidence shall be sentenced to imprisonment for seven years or more in the first instance, and all their property shall be confiscated. The enemy and puppet property liquidation agencies can then seal up all their property and immediately put it up for auction or sale. The income will be the national treasury's state-owned property income.

### Central Government Agency Civil Servants Food Rice Distribution Measures The Executive Yuan Announces Implementation from This Month

[Report from our Nanjing office, 12th] The Executive Yuan recently announced four measures for the distribution of food rice to civil servants in central government agencies, which will be implemented from February. The original articles are as follows: (1) From February 1948, central government agency civil servants will be provided with 3 shi dou of medium-quality food rice per person per month free of charge. Technicians and laborers will be provided with 2 shi dou of medium-quality food rice per person per month free of charge. Police officers and police officers of police agencies who have not received food rice will be handled in accordance with the regulations for staff members. The central government agencies mentioned in the preceding paragraph are limited to those listed in the annual national budget as having living subsidies for Xuan Tong government agencies, public opinion agencies, and national schools. Military agencies, troops, publicly owned operating agencies, and business agencies whose living subsidies are included in the business expenses will not be issued. (2) Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin uniformly distribute physical objects as before. Other regions temporarily distribute cash according to the prescribed amount of food rice due to food shortages. The standard for the food rice substitute in the preceding paragraph is one province (city) as one region, which is determined by the Ministry of Food each month based on the average retail food price in each region in the previous month, and notified to the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. (3) The food rice substitute to be received by the employees of each agency shall be strictly drawn from the reserve for living subsidies in the national budget in accordance with the standard of food rice substitute in each region and each month determined by the Ministry of Food and the number of employees who actually have monthly living subsidies, and allocated by each agency according to the actual number of employees. If the aforementioned reserve is insufficient, the Ministry of Finance may first make a mechanical allocation and then complete the formalities afterwards. (4) Ping is mainly based on pasta. Each staff member will be changed to 33 jin of No. 2 flour per month (equal to 3 shi dou of food rice converted into three-quarters of a bag of flour), and technicians and laborers will receive 22 jin of flour per month (equal to 2 shi dou of food rice converted into half a bag of flour). Beijing and Shanghai will be issued food rice or equivalent flour in accordance with the provisions of item 1. The procedures for receiving rice and flour shall be carried out by each agency with the purchase certificates issued by the distribution agencies, and the grain distribution agencies shall be required to collect the physical objects. Those who do not need physical objects shall be recovered by the Ministry of Food at a price. The original food rice or flour distributed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Pingjin in accordance with the regulations on the supply of daily necessities will be cancelled from February.

### Mayors of Beiping and Tianjin Fly to Beijing to Attend Food Rationing Conference

[Our Beiping Office, 12th] The Five Major Cities Food Conference is scheduled to convene in Beijing on the 15th. He Siyuan, the Mayor of Beiping, Wen Chongxin, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Du Jianshi, the Mayor of Tianjin, and Hu Meng, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, are scheduled to fly to Beijing tomorrow. Mr. He plans to raise the following issues at the conference: (1) The number of refugees in Beiping is increasing daily, and it is extremely unreasonable to continue using 1.7 million as the standard for per capita distribution. (2) The proportion conversion for changing rice allocation to flour should be adjusted reasonably. (3) The issue of using export foreign exchange to purchase grain.

[Our Tianjin Office, 12th] Du Jianshi, the Mayor of Tianjin, went to Beiping on the 12th and is scheduled to fly to Beijing with He Siyuan on the 14th to attend the Five Major Cities Food Rationing Conference convened by the Ministry of Food.

### Jiangsu Provincial Civil Servants to be Cut by 10% Next Month

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 12th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government's painstaking problem of staff reduction has reached the final decision stage. It is reported that provincial-level agencies plan to reduce staff by 10% starting in March to comply with central government regulations. However, because each agency has vacancies, the actual average reduction is less than 5%.

### Jiangxi Provincial Government Plans Staff Reductions

[Our Nanchang Office, 12th] The new salaries for Jiangxi provincial government teachers and staff were barely paid at 70% of the original amount before New Year's Eve in January. There is still no solution for February. The provincial government is planning to abolish and merge branches of agencies and further reduce staff. The departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, and education are also planning to work together in one office. This can be legally implemented after Wang Lingji returns to the province from Gu.

### Registration of Naturalized Citizens: Internal Order for Implementation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] In recent years, the number of foreign women who have become Chinese wives and foreigners or stateless persons who have obtained Chinese citizenship through naturalization has been increasing daily. However, according to the provisions of Article 2 of the Chinese Nationality Law, those who have obtained the nationality of the Republic of China should apply for household registration in accordance with the provisions of Article 18, Paragraph 1, Item 6 of the Household Registration Law. However, to date, a large number of them have not completed the procedures with the household registration authorities in their places of residence in accordance with the law. The Ministry of the Interior has recently issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments to thoroughly investigate the situation through the household registration authorities from this year onwards and order the naturalized citizens to complete the various registration procedures to comply with legal requirements.

### Executive Yuan Regular Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Executive Yuan held its 42nd meeting on the morning of the 11th, chaired by President Zhang. It amended and passed the handling principles for overdue applications for the purchase of wool, one item of goods brought into port with privately held foreign exchange without a permit, and the organizational regulations of the Executive Yuan Relief Special Donation Supervision Committee and the list of members and advisors of the committee, and approved a batch of appointments and removals of officials.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee to Establish Offices in Seventeen Locations

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee has decided to establish first-class offices in six locations: Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuxi, Chongqing, and Xi'an; second-class offices in eight locations: Qingdao, Nanjing, Nantong, Hangzhou, Yin County, Wuhu, Shenyang, and Taipei; and third-class offices in three locations: Wu County, Wujin, and Kunming.

### Internal Affairs Ministry Drafts Survey Items for This Year's Census

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Regarding the national census to be held in 1948, the Population Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior is currently drafting census forms. The survey items include nine items: name, title, gender, age, native place, marital status, educational level, and whether residence in the county or city has been full six months. Border provinces and regions may be ordered to add items such as ethnicity, language, and religion. If any party has comments, the Bureau may consider them.

### Bao-Tian Road Project Completed; Passenger and Freight Transport to Open at Month's End

[Our Lanzhou Office, 12th] The Bao-Tian Railway, which has been under renovation for more than a year, has largely been completed. Passenger and freight transport will be opened on February 25th, but freight transport will be limited to packages for the time being.

### National Resources Commission to Send Team to Investigate Uranium Mine in Guizhou Province

[Reuters, Nanjing, 12th] The National Resources Commission will send an exploration team to Guizhou Province in the second half of February to investigate the uranium mine located in Zhongshan and Fuchuan Counties. The uranium ore in this area was discovered a year ago. After chemical testing, it was confirmed to contain abundant uranium that can be used to manufacture atomic bombs. The exploration team will first investigate the scope of the mining area in order to carry out large-scale mining.

### Recruitment and Training Plan for Youths from Communist-Controlled Areas in Northeast China Formulated

[Our Pan Yang Office, 12th] The plan to recruit and train youths from Communist-controlled areas in Northeast China has been formulated and will be implemented starting in February. Key points: (1) Recruiting those aged 15 to 25 with an elementary school education or above who have returned from Communist-controlled areas. (2) Establishing recruitment and training brigades in Shenyang and Changchun. (3) The training period is six months, with the curriculum focusing on changing their lifestyle and thinking. After the period, they will be sent to school or employed separately.

### Suspension of the Method for Screening County-Level Cadres in the Suiyuan Area

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] The case of suspending the continued application of the method for screening administrative cadres at all levels in the Suiyuan-Hejing area has been approved by the Executive Yuan. According to the method, it was originally intended to settle party members and league members who had changed jobs, political cadres from the military who were downsized, and a small number of military officers who had changed jobs. However, the provinces failed to settle them, and the current political situation has changed, so it was decided to suspend the application temporarily.

### Troop慰勞 in Nanjing and Zhenjiang

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Shen Fenglian, the standing director of the Women's Campaign to Suppress the Rebellion Mobilization Committee, and her party went to the Tangshan Army Hospital this morning at 10:00 a.m. with a large number of comfort items to慰勞 wounded soldiers and held a get-together. In the afternoon, they went to the Xiguan recruit reception station to慰勞.

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 12th] Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, on behalf of Chairman Jiang, personally went to the Qilidian and Chengbaimiao wounded soldier hospitals on the morning of the 10th to visit wounded and sick officers and soldiers and distributed慰勞 items. The wounded soldiers in the hospital expressed their gratitude.

### Price Increases Reported in Various Places During the Spring Festival

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 12th] The Zhenjiang business community has safely passed the Lunar New Year. Most stores in the market, except rice shops, are still closed today to celebrate the Spring Festival. Currently, the price of rice in Zhenjiang is 1.55 million yuan per shi.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 12th] During the Spring Festival, prices in this city skyrocketed. Fine flour is 1.1 million per bag, white japonica rice is 2.8 million per shi, and other daily necessities have increased by one-third.

[Our Nanchang Office, 12th] The Nanchang market after the Spring Festival is still in a "spring sleep." The rice market rose sharply on New Year's Eve, breaking the one million mark, keeping pace with gold and silver. Most industries hoard goods and do not sell them, and they are still expecting prices to rise, but there is still no market.

[Our Fuzhou Office, 12th] The Spring Festival prices in Rong City have been relatively quiet. Rice has fallen back to the 2.2 million level (it had risen to 2.4 million before New Year's Eve). Oil prices are soaring at around 7 million. There is no market for cotton cloth, and local specialties are sluggish. Fuzhou oranges are expensive due to low production, with prices reaching over 20,000 per catty.

[Our Pan Yang Office, 12th] The Pan Yang market fluctuated after the Spring Festival, and daily necessities rose by another 20%. Commercial banks barely survived the old year. The Central Bank provided relief, and various banks also showed a spirit of mutual assistance. Bank holidays commenced on the first day of the old year, and remittances to Guannei in small amounts were extremely active on the 2nd and 3rd.

### North China Campaign to Suppress Rebellion and Nation-Building Joint Committee to be Established in Beiping This Month

[Our Beiping Office, 12th] The North China Campaign to Suppress Rebellion and Nation-Building Joint Committee will be organized by the speakers of the Beiping, Tianjin, Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan Provincial Assemblies and will be established in Beiping this month in order to promote the Campaign to Suppress Rebellion in North China in the same steps. The Hebei Provincial Campaign Mobilization Committee is currently actively preparing to establish one office and four groups, with fifteen committee members. The Tianjin Campaign to Suppress Rebellion Mobilization Committee was established on the 13th of last month. The Police Department also issued a written statement.

### Five Arrested Students in Beiping Sent to Court for Trial; Police Department Also Issues Written Statement

[Our Beiping Office, 12th] The five students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Fu Jen Catholic University who were arrested, Song Guozhu, Zheng Xuechun, Fan Guangdou, Gao Tongqing, and Deng Teqian, were sent to the court by the Garrison Headquarters yesterday. The Garrison Headquarters issued a written statement in response to the criticism from the outside world regarding whether the arrest and trial violated the Constitution, stating: Article 8 of the Constitution clearly stipulates that, except for the exception that "the arrest of a flagrant offender shall be otherwise determined by law...", the Garrison Headquarters arrested them based on the Measures for Handling Communist Party Members in the Rear Areas. Because they were all committing crimes, they were all flagrant offenders according to the Criminal Procedure Law, so the Garrison Headquarters had the right to arrest them. Regarding the issue of whether the interrogation by the Garrison Headquarters was legal, the National Government instructed on November 29, 1947, to change the phrase "transfer to a judicial organ with jurisdiction within the statutory time" in Article 8 of the Measures for Handling Communist Party Members in the Rear Areas to "transfer to a military law organ within the statutory time." However, in order to take care of the students, there was also an order instructing: "Students in schools who are suspected of being Communist Party members should first be sent to the judicial organs for trial." Since the Garrison Headquarters has the power of military law trial, it is not subject to the restriction of transferring to the court within 24 hours at the latest.

### The Weather in Shenyang is Warming Up

[Our Pan Yang Office, 12th] The weather in Shenyang is warming up, with a noon temperature of 3 degrees Celsius. Accumulated snow is melting, and the roads are muddy. The Xing Yuan has ordered all agencies to stop providing heating from the 6th, except when the temperature suddenly drops to 15 degrees Celsius below zero.

### Returned Overseas Chinese Return to Singapore; Another 3,000 People Will Be Sent

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Regarding the repatriation of returned overseas Chinese to the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, it is currently being actively carried out. As of January this year, more than 14,000 people have been repatriated. Those who have not been repatriated are being negotiated by our Consul General in Singapore, Wu Bosheng, in conjunction with the person in charge of the Hong Kong Office of the International Refugee Relief Organization. The Singapore side has agreed to repatriate another 3,000 people, and the procedures have already begun in early February.

### Repatriation of Returned Overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies; Registration to be Processed on Schedule

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] The repatriation of returned overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies was previously unable to be carried out due to the impact of the war in that area. Now that the war in the Dutch East Indies has ended, the Guangzhou Office of the Far East Bureau of the United Nations International Refugee Organization has been ordered to start registration in order to transfer the number of repatriated people and locations to the Dutch East Indies for negotiation. The date of departure will still have to wait until the Dutch East Indies government confirms it before a public announcement can be made. In Guangzhou and the Siyi area, registration will be held at the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Affairs Office on February 23. In Qiongyai, it will be handled by the Haikou Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Overseas Chinese who register for repatriation must have returned to China during World War II and hold valid documents issued by the local government in order to be valid.

### Han Chinese Merchants Persecuted in Tibet

[Our Chongqing Office, 12th] It is reported that Han Chinese merchants Ji Junxian, Lü Da, and Li Xumin in Qamdo were recently poisoned and beaten by subordinates of Lhalu Galun, the chief administrator of Tibet in Qamdo, and were forced to leave the country. In Lhasa, incidents of killing Han Chinese Yang Hansan and others also occurred.

### Two Main Culprits in the Armed Drug Trafficking Case in Xichang Sentenced to Death

[Our Chongqing Office, 12th] The armed drug trafficking case in Xichang, which caused a sensation, was solved by the Xichang Garrison Headquarters after several months of investigation. The Xing Yuan specially sent cadres to conduct a joint trial. It has been learned that the main culprits Peng Kaihua and Li Yaoqing were sentenced to death, and Yang Junqing was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Xing Yuan has telegraphed the Xichang Garrison Headquarters to execute them on the spot.

### Jiangxi Province Requests Industrial Loans to Save the Industrial Crisis

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 12th] Jiangxi Province's industry, whose foundation was not stable before the war, has been affected by price and financial fluctuations in recent years, and 93 factories have closed down one after another. Only 72 factories remain to date. In order to save the industrial crisis, the Jiangxi Construction Department is consulting with the Four Banks Branch to hold industrial loans in order.

### Civil Service Evaluation and Selection to Continue Under Existing Laws and Regulations; Registration Deadline Rumor is Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Regarding the recent rumor that the registration method for civil service evaluation and selection ended at the end of last year, a person in charge of the Civil Service Evaluation and Selection Department stated: "The rumor does not correspond to the facts." However, the qualifications stipulated in the current laws and regulations on civil service appointment, grade selection, and registration, except for passing the examination, are in conflict with the second half of Article 85 of this law, which stipulates that those who have not passed the examination shall not be appointed. Previously, amendments have been drafted separately and submitted to the Examination Yuan, which is being reviewed in accordance with the Constitution. All evaluation and selection laws and regulations that conflict with the Constitution should have been submitted separately for amendment or repeal before the implementation of the Constitution. However, because some are closely related to the Civil Service Appointment Law, they cannot be amended or repealed until the amendment to the Civil Service Appointment Law is promulgated. Some also need to wait until the new law is promulgated before they can be repealed. There are also cases where it seems that they should be repealed immediately, but they cannot be temporarily applied due to factual needs. The circumstances are different, and they should be handled separately. According to Item 1 of the Program Law for the End of Political Tutelage, the powers prescribed by the original laws and regulations exercised by the National Government shall cease on the day the president elected in accordance with the Constitution takes office. Therefore, in the period after the implementation of the Constitution and before the president takes office, the old law is still effective if the new law has not been promulgated. Based on the above principles, this city has already listed and submitted for approval the existing various evaluation and selection laws and regulations that conflict with the Constitution and should be amended or repealed, as well as the handling situation. Instructions have not yet been received. Before various laws and regulations have been ordered to be repealed or amended, they will continue to be applied temporarily.

### After the Katayama Cabinet Resigns En Masse, the New Cabinet in Japan is Stillborn; Ashida is the Focus of Attention for the Prime Minister's Seat; Yoshida Attempts to Monopolize Power and Refuses to Attend the Four-Party Meeting

[New Asia News Agency Comprehensive Report] Since Mr. Katayama proposed the resignation en masse at the cabinet meeting on the 8th, activities in various aspects have been particularly active. According to a Tokyo dispatch on the 12th, the Katayama cabinet decided to resign en masse in the last cabinet meeting on the morning of the 11th, and Katayama Tetsuji submitted his resignation to the Emperor at 11:30 a.m. and notified the two houses of the Senate and the House of Representatives at 11:40 a.m. Before the formal resignation en masse, Prime Minister Katayama had already issued a statement on the resignation en masse, the gist of which was: "The resignation en masse of the cabinet today is the inevitable result of the united cabinet. I am fortunate that I have not made any mistakes in the development of Japanese democracy. In particular, I have tried my best to avoid dissolving the House of Representatives and causing the cabinet to resign en masse, which is the result of a fair judgment on the domestic and foreign political situation. As for the future cabinet, in the current situation where there is no absolute majority party, I think it is more appropriate to organize a united cabinet, because a united cabinet can increase foreign confidence in Japan, and Japan's economy can be restored. Although the cabinet has resigned en masse today, it is closer to the ideals of us and others." In the House of Representatives, after learning of the cabinet's decision to resign en masse, it convened a parliamentary management committee on the 10th to discuss the nomination of the new prime minister in accordance with Article 67 of the new constitution. In the meeting, the Democratic Party advocated convening a consultation between the leaders of the four major political parties, while the small faction rose up in opposition. Based on this resolution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Matsuoka, visited the leaders of the Democratic Party, Ashida, the Socialist Party, Katayama, and the National Cooperative Party, Sanda, respectively on the morning of the 11th to exchange views. The three people agreed to convene a meeting of the leaders of the four parties. Then Matsuoka went to see Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party, but Yoshida still insisted on opposing it, believing that since the Liberal Party is the largest opposition party, it should naturally tend to the regime. Therefore, the organization of the next cabinet still needs several days of compromise. However, in a speech at the cadre meeting held by the Liberal Party on the 12th, Yoshida Shigeru seemed to have expressed his willingness to compromise on the issue of the four-party coalition cabinet, but the Liberal Party should obtain the position of prime minister in the coalition cabinet. In the House of Councilors, the Green Breeze Society expressed its support for Mr. Yoshida, believing that Mr. Yoshida was nominated as the next prime minister with the qualifications of the president of the largest opposition party, which is "the constitutional path." General observers believe that the resignation en masse of the Katayama cabinet was premature, which caused Yoshida's conservative new party movement to fail to succeed. Because the conservative new party movement was not mature, the performance of the Democratic and National Cooperative parties is still to support the four-party coalition cabinet and not sympathize with Mr. Yoshida's proposal. As of the date of the Katayama cabinet's resignation en masse, the power of the various parties in the House of Representatives is as follows: 123 seats for the Socialist Party, 119 seats for the Liberal Party, 106 seats for the Democratic Party, 32 seats for the National Cooperative Party, 22 seats for the Comrade Association, 16 seats for the All-Farmers' Party, 15 seats for the First Member Club, 7 seats for the Farmers' Party, 4 seats for the Communist Party, 2 seats for independents, and 20 vacancies. Under the above-mentioned distribution of power, if some external pressure is added, the possibility of a coalition cabinet of all parties uniting the country is the greatest, but the nomination of the prime minister is still a major problem. According to the current situation, it seems that Mr. Keda has a greater chance of being elected.

[United News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The Katayama cabinet resigned because the left and right wings of the Social Democratic Party had already resigned on the 10th, but they remained in office to await the parliament's appointment of a new prime minister.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The future cabinet may still be composed of parties that organize a coalition government, and the prime minister will be Ashida Hitoshi.

### The Opinions of the Various Parties in Japan are Divided; The Secretaries-General of the Four Major Parties Hold a Meeting to Discuss the Basic Policy for the Next Prime Minister

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Because Matsuoka, the Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives, failed to convene a meeting of the leaders of the four parties, in order to quickly decide the issue of the next prime minister, he held a meeting of the secretaries-general of the Liberal, Democratic, Socialist, and National Cooperative parties at 2:15 p.m. on the 12th. First, Matsuoka reported on the process of failing to convene a meeting of the leaders of the four parties, and then proposed whether representatives of small factions should also participate in the meeting. Ohno, the secretary-general of the Liberal Party, was the first to express his approval and decided that from tomorrow onwards, each small faction should also send one representative to participate in the talks.

Also in the meeting, Ohno said: "President Yoshida's opinion is to hope to organize a conservative coalition cabinet centered on the Liberal Party, but intends not to dissolve the parliament as much as possible." Tomibechi, the secretary-general of the Democratic Party, said: "A national coalition cabinet is the most appropriate, and any other cabinet cannot be approved," implying an opinion against the Liberal Party. Okada, the secretary-general of the National Cooperative Party, immediately expressed his support for the proposal, and it is clear that a common front between the Democratic and National Cooperative parties has been established. Asanuma, the secretary-general of the Socialist Party, said: "The attitude of the Socialist Party has not yet been decided," reserving its attitude. After the meeting, Matsuoka told reporters: "The basic policy for the next prime minister has been decided. In tomorrow's meeting, it can probably be established. In the future, the act of nominating and electing the prime minister by the members of the parliament is just a lot of talk. In short, we will work hard to decide it as soon as possible."

### Britain Will Reduce Its Occupation Forces in Japan

[Report] London, 12th broadcast: Tonight, the three ministries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force announced that Britain will greatly reduce the United Kingdom's occupation forces in Japan. This is the result of the successful military management of Japan. According to a spokesman for the Army Department, the current United Kingdom troops stationed in Japan are about 2,000 to 3,000 people. As for how many will be left after the reduction, it was not mentioned.
Collecting evidence of Japan's poisoning of China

### Ji Nan Demands Judgment: Tojo and Others Should Be Sentenced to Death; Collecting Evidence of Japanese Poisoning of China

[United Press Tokyo, 12th] The prosecution of the Far East International Military Tribunal on the 12th continued to present evidence point by point to demonstrate the crimes of Tojo and his accomplices. The prosecution stated: Japan presided over the sale of narcotics in China to weaken Chinese resistance and used the profits to conquer the world. The profits from narcotics were so substantial that the puppet Manchukuo claimed that this income was second only to customs revenue. "Young female attendants were employed in 'swallows' nests,' and narcotics were sold in brothels to make opium and narcotics consumption more attractive." Japan implemented aggressive economic policies in China, shamelessly claiming that it would use the surplus to support the Japanese army. Chief Prosecutor Ji Nan requested the court on the morning of the 11th to sentence all defendants to the most severe punishment.

### Two Million People Participate in Grand Ceremony; Mahatma's Ashes Scattered in Ganges River; 79 Cannons Fired in Salute

[United Press Allahabad, India, 12th] Two million Indians stood on the banks of the sacred Ganges River on the 12th, tearfully watching the ashes of their martyred leader, Gandhi, being scattered on the water to attain immortal fame. The special train carrying the ashes arrived in the holy city of Allahabad from New Delhi at exactly 9:00 AM. Indians lined both sides of the railway tracks for miles to welcome it. At the same time, several planes flew back and forth in the sky, scattering flowers. Gandhi's ashes were stored in a bronze urn, which was then taken from the train and placed on a three-colored flower bed on a funeral boat, which sailed towards the riverbank.

The ceremony lasted for one hour. It was originally planned to scatter the ashes at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers at 12:30 AM, but it was slightly delayed due to the large crowd. Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Home Minister Patel had arrived earlier to welcome the special train. Nehru looked somber, his face filled with sorrow. He personally led many cabinet ministers onto the funeral boat and proceeded to the riverbank. As the train entered the station, Gandhi's granddaughters sang Indian elegies. When the urn of ashes was moved into the boat, dignitaries stood by with their heads bowed, and the military saluted. Before the special train arrived at this location, it had stopped for ten hours at the small station of Rosa Rabad because there were no guards on the train, fearing a rush by the crowds. Although the guards arrived later, the surging crowds could not be stopped. Many people paid their respects with their hands clasped together in the Indian custom, and some cried aloud. At 9:45 AM, led by five armored vehicles, the procession slowly advanced towards the Ganges River. A monk sang elegies at the head of the procession, followed by mounted police and Gurkha infantry, with their guns held downward. As far as the eye could see, the fields to the left were filled with Indians like mountains and seas, with thousands of bonfires and swirling smoke, making the sky above the holy city look like a dense accumulation of clouds.

[Reuters New Delhi, 11th] Gandhi's ashes were transported today by a special army train to Allahabad, where they will be scattered at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers. At that time, 79 cannons, representing Gandhi's 79 years of age, will fire a salute every two minutes. Simultaneously, ceremonies will be held at 50 Hindu holy sites across the country, with an estimated participation of over ten million people from various religious backgrounds.

### Indian Police Crack Another Secret Organization

Related to Gandhi Assassination Case

The Spread of War Made One Think of the Vatican

The war between the Soviet Union and Finland was being waged in the snows of the north. Finnish heroism had turned the easy conquest expected by the Soviet Union into a fierce three-month war.

Although this war added two to the list of belligerent countries, Europe was filled with rumors of peace activities throughout the last months of 1939. The stalemate period after the collapse of Poland created a good reason for peace rumors and gestures. These concerned me because they consistently linked the United States with ongoing peace movements.

As early as October 2, 1939, the US Minister to Romania, Gunther, telegraphed me that the Romanian Foreign Minister expressed deep interest in the possibility of the US President launching a peace movement. The next day, I telegraphed back that there was no intention to carry out such a movement, and that we had not received any indication from any belligerent country requesting us to launch a peace initiative. Hitler, in his speech on October 6, put forward empty peace proposals—of course, this peace would allow him to retain most of what he had seized in the war, as well as Czechoslovakia and Austria. After he delivered his speech, Ambassador to Belgium Davis cabled the President and me, saying that a certain authoritative source (later learned to be King Leopold of Belgium) requested him to state: Only the President could prevent Germany from attacking Western Europe, and Belgium very much hoped that the President could make an effort, as he had done in previous crises.

On the same day (October 7), our Counselor in Berlin, Kirk, cabled that a certain person close to Hitler suggested that the President could use Hitler's speech as an opportunity to send a secret message to Hitler, agreeing with "his peace efforts" and requesting him to clarify his basic principles for establishing peace. Two days later, Kirk cabled that the German spokesman said that if the President suggested a truce and negotiated peace, the German side could accept it, and he also indicated that the German side could participate in a conference far from the war zone (some people thought this referred to Washington). The next day, US Minister to Finland Schoenfeld cabled, conveying the Finnish Foreign Minister's suggestion that the United States could initiate an exploration of the possibility of peace. After receiving so many cables of the same nature, I convened my colleagues on Sunday, October 8, and held a meeting in my office. I invited Davis to attend, as I often invited him to participate in discussions when I especially needed his insights and long experience. We had already had a very detailed discussion on whether the United States could take reasonable action to restore peace in Europe at this time.

At this Sunday meeting, we reviewed a draft of suggestions that the United States might make. In it, we would ask the belligerent countries to state their peace terms; declare our willingness to act as an intermediary, passing on communications on this issue to the opposing belligerent countries. After exchanging many opinions, I stated that I did not think that the United States launching a peace movement at this time could have a significant effect.

Because Hitler had always been the victor, any action we could take in terms of peace would only benefit him and discourage the Allies. We had no reason to force Britain and France to make peace under such conditions. Once we made a peace proposal to Britain and France, it would put them in the wrong position. If they accepted, they would have to agree to most of Hitler's terms; if they refused, they would bear the blame for rejecting peace.

Our decision not to take action did not prevent the continued spread of rumors. We seemed to feel that many of these rumors came from Germany, partly to make people believe that Hitler had always been ready for peace, and another purpose was to confuse the Allies with rumors of separate peace and aggression.

On November 5, Counselor Kirk cabled from Berlin that Schacht said that if he received a guarantee of an audience with the President to present his views on resolving the European dispute, he would be willing to come to the United States for non-political talks. Kirk also reported that he had recently noticed the same efforts of a completely unofficial nature, but he warned us not to attach too much importance to them because the decision on war and peace continued to rest with Hitler.

In our view, Schacht's actions seemed to be part of the German government's overall effort to contact other governments through unofficial personnel. These unofficial personnel appeared to be completely unrelated to the German government, and in some ways, they were even opposed to the German government.

When King Leopold of Belgium suddenly went to The Hague to jointly mediate an end to the war with Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Ambassador Davis telegraphed the President and me on November 7 that Germany would attack the Netherlands on November 9, which prompted their action. The Dutch Minister, Loudon, came to see me on the 9th, his emotions very agitated. He gave a note from his government to the President and me, which said that the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands would be violated in a few days or even hours. On November 11, the President replied by telegram to King Leopold of Belgium and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, reiterating his friendship but without making any firm statement.

On December 14, Ambassador to France Bullitt cabled from Paris about what the French Foreign Minister, Li Jia, had told him. According to Li Jia, Mussolini was trying to promote a premature peace in order to maintain the Nazi regime of the Axis powers and to protect his own regime in Italy. Li Jia believed that Mussolini wanted to restore the basic principles of the Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy that Italy had proposed in 1933.

At the same time, the President and we discussed plans to establish relations with the Vatican. In early July, two months before the outbreak of war, Charmers discussed with me the benefits we could obtain from such a relationship. We felt that the Vatican had information in many areas, especially about what was happening in Germany, Italy, and Spain, which we did not have. At my suggestion, Welles wrote a private letter to US Ambassador to Rome, Phillips, seeking his opinion. On July 19, Phillips' reply suggested establishing diplomatic relations and appointing a Protestant as the US representative. Welles gave this letter to the President.

In conversations with the President, I argued that we could not send a formal ambassador to the Vatican, but only a personal representative of the President to negotiate with the Pope. I agreed with Phillips' suggestion that this representative should be a Protestant. Britain followed this procedure, appointing a Protestant as the Minister to the Vatican and another Catholic as the First Secretary in the Ministry. I also said that if he took this step, he would receive the same cooperation from other church leaders in America. Ambassador Phillips in Rome telegraphed me on September 25 that the Vatican's "Osservatore Romano" had given full and objective coverage to the President's neutrality message to Congress. I sent the original telegram to the President for reference.

Then on October 2, the President sent me a very long memorandum. The memorandum began by saying: "This is an idea that I just thought of, and I haven't discussed it with anyone else." He anticipated that after the end of the war, whether it was soon, or another summer, or three, five years, there would be a large number of refugees, including Christians and Jews, from various countries, even Britain, France, and Italy.

The President continued: "For this reason, I wonder if you and I should start considering discussing the whole issue with the Vatican, the American Council of Churches, and similar institutions in Europe while the war is going on. Contact with the Jews has already been achieved through the Myron Taylor Committee.

"But contact with the Catholics should be directly with the Vatican itself, because this issue is more important to the Catholic Church in Europe than to the Catholic Church in the United States.

"Therefore, I think that although there is no special reason to rush, we might consider sending a special envoy or ambassador to the Vatican in the future so that we can have a direct communication system on the European Catholic refugee problem."

In his memorandum, the President suggested sending a diplomatic representative to the Pope entirely on the basis of the refugee problem. He did not mention the point that the Vatican could be a factor in achieving peace, although that point was extremely important to him later.

On October 10, he sent me another memorandum about Ambassador Phillips' report that the "Osservatore Romano" had published the President's neutrality message to Congress. Mr. Roosevelt said: "For various reasons, I think you might as well send a telegram to Phillips along the following lines: 'Please explain to the Papal Foreign Minister when it is convenient for you. The President is pleased that the "Osservatore Romano" has published American news in an impartial manner.'" I sent a telegram to Phillips on October 11 as directed, and on October 20, I received his reply that the Pope was pleased with the President's telegram.

After weeks of propaganda on the Vatican's side, I telegraphed Phillips on December 23, telling him the content of the President's Christmas letter to the Pope. This letter would be made public the next day, and the President would also announce that Myron Taylor had been appointed as the envoy to the Vatican. The original letter was sent through Archbishop Spellman of New York (now a Cardinal) to representatives of several denominations in Washington. The President also sent the same letter to Dr. White Patrick, President of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, a Protestant leader, and Dr. Adler, President of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. No one could have been more suitable for Taylor's appointment than he was. He had broad wisdom and extraordinary knowledge. In addition to his work at the Vatican, he also became an active member in our work to initiate and promote the outline of a world peace organization.

Taylor set out for Europe in February 1940, and our new relationship with the Vatican began. The Pope seemed to have the same realistic view of the European peace issue as we did. He was determined not to propose a solution unless a lasting peace could be achieved. This opportunity would not come until Germany was disintegrated.

### Turkey Determined to Resist Aggression; US Considering Increasing Aid to Greece and Turkey

### This City's Conscription for This Year is Six Thousand - Ordered to be Completed Before the End of June - The Garrison District is Actively Carrying Out Preparatory Work - Over Two Thousand Veterans Arrive in Shanghai from Tianjin

This city's conscription for this year was originally planned to be carried out in two phases. The first phase had a quota of three thousand six hundred men, to be completed before the end of March, and the second phase had a quota of two thousand four hundred men, to be completed before the end of September. The authorities, in order to simplify procedures, have now combined the two phases into one, that is, a total of six thousand men are to be conscripted, to be completed before the end of June. The Shanghai Garrison District has already received this order, and preparatory work is actively underway.

Furthermore, over two thousand veterans from the Fifth Provisional Rehabilitation Institute for Veterans under the Joint Logistics Headquarters, led by Director Liu Fusheng, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on the Haili ship at 5 PM on the 11th. Party Chief Fang of the Kuomintang City Party Committee, as well as You Ziqing from the representative comfort delegation, Zhao Xiangchu and Luo Zhenglun from the Encouragement Society, and many others, including Lu Huimin and Xie Yonghua from the Women's Association, went to the pier to greet them. When the Haili ship docked, cannons were fired and music was played to welcome them. Chief Fang delivered a brief welcoming speech on behalf of all sectors, with many words of encouragement. Then, the Big Baby Drama Troupe performed various entertainment acts, which were extremely wonderful. The committee of all sectors in this city for receiving and comforting soldiers passing through on their way to the front also presented comfort items and a large number of books and periodicals. It is heard that after this batch of veterans disembarks, they will transfer to a train to go to a certain place for recuperation.

Director Fang of the Kuomintang City Party Committee, who previously accepted the invitation of Commander-in-Chief Guo of the Joint Logistics Headquarters and Colonel Boben, Advisor to the US Military in China, to go to Beijing to visit the barracks of new recruits passing through the capital, has already completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the night train on the 9th to preside over the Spring Festival celebration for comforting the troops. Fang stated to reporters yesterday: "I felt very pleased to be invited to visit the barracks for new recruits passing through the capital this time. On the morning of the 9th, I was accompanied by senior officials of the Joint Logistics Headquarters to visit the barracks in the Xiaguan Pukou area. The facilities in the barracks everywhere are very complete, and the surrounding environment is also very beautiful. The new recruits all expressed their satisfaction with the warm reception from all sectors in the capital, and their morale was also boosted." Fang also said that Shanghai was the first in the country to initiate the reception of new recruits passing through, and with the support of enthusiastic people in recent months, it has been quite successful and has been highly praised by Chairman Chiang and central figures. He hopes that enthusiastic people will continue to support it in the future, and strive to improve the accommodation of new recruits in order to increase the strength to quell the rebellion. It is also learned that Fang plans to invite Mayor Wu and leaders from all sectors in the near future to discuss matters related to the reception of new recruits.

### Spring Festival Comfort for New Recruits - Chief Fang Encourages Efforts to Suppress Bandits - Gifts Distributed and Emotions are High

The Spring Festival troop comfort movement in this city was held in districts on the morning of the 10th, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. In Jiangwan, under the leadership of Director Fang of the Kuomintang City Party Committee, a comfort rally was held at the New Recruit Model Camp in the sports field at 9 AM, attended by more than four thousand new recruits. Chief Fang presided over the meeting and delivered an impromptu speech entitled "Knowing Shame, Teaching War, Welcoming the Spring Festival." Fang briefly stated: "Last year can be considered the most difficult year since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The flames of war have not been extinguished, and prices have soared. After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, with heavy sacrifices, the country could have been restored and built, and the people could have lived and worked in peace, but due to the trouble and destruction caused by the Communist bandits, the work of restoration and construction cannot be carried out, and the people's lives are miserable, living in deep water and scorching fire. In the places where the bandit troops arrive, they universally launch struggles and liquidations, create class hatred, promote 'land revolution', instruct unemployed vagrants and hooligans to control the countryside, oppress good peasants, and make everyone have no food to eat, and encourage siblings to kill each other, forcing women to serve as comfort troupe members, implementing the so-called 'public wife system' for the lust of the bandit army cadres. Intellectuals are labeled as 'cultural landlords' and also suffer tragic killings. After the victory, we have already become one of the five great powers, but now our international status has plummeted. It can be said that this kind of pain and shame are all inflicted on us by the Communist bandits. We must 'know shame', recognize that the Communist bandits' rebellion is a great shame and humiliation for the country. After knowing shame, we must be brave to 'avenge shame', use our blood and flesh to wash away the shame and strive for glory. How can we 'avenge shame'? We must 'teach war', fight for saving the country and the people, fight for construction and revitalization, fight for freedom and light, fight for democracy and constitutional government. Everyone must have the determination to fight, take on the responsibility of fighting, work hard to suppress bandits and kill thieves, and complete the task of quelling the rebellion and saving the country," and so on. After the speech, various wonderful entertainment acts were performed, and each person was given a bar of soap, a box of sweets, a pack of cigarettes, and pork. The new recruits were all very happy and dispersed at 1 PM.

### The Eighth Comfort Team Comforts Troops at Longhua Temple

Also on this day, all sectors of Shanghai organized a comfort team to comfort the wounded soldiers in the local wounded soldiers' hospital and the soldiers in the new recruit camps passing through. The leader of the Eighth Comfort Team, Wan Molin, led all the members of the Brothers Technical Troupe to the garrison site of Longhua Temple at 9:30 AM to comfort the new recruits passing through the area. The Brothers Technical Troupe performed technical skills and distributed comfort items, with each person receiving four taels of pork, a bar of soap, a pack of cigarettes, and a bag of sweets. All the soldiers were extremely excited. They did not disperse until 1 PM.

### Destitute in a Foreign Land, Impoverished at the End of the Year, Intellectual Laments Bankruptcy of Reputation, Swallows Poison in Court Seeking Death, Hu Diya Not Out of Danger, Details the Ordeal on His Sickbed

[Our Newspaper News] Hu Diya, the editing director of the China United News Agency, was accused of theft by Zhu Haiping, the vice president of the agency. Yesterday, when the court opened for interrogation, Hu, due to the impact on his reputation and under economic pressure, swallowed mercury cyanide in court and committed suicide. The court sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's stomach pumping, the cyanide was still in his intestines, and as of press time, he had not yet escaped danger. Yesterday, the reporter rode in a rickshaw to Guangci Hospital and visited this "colleague" who attempted suicide. He was lying in a third-class ward on the third floor of Guangci Hospital, wearing an old navy blue suit, with disheveled hair and a haggard face. Seeing the reporter come, he seemed extremely excited and struggled to support his frail body to describe the theft accusation and the suicide attempt.

First, he showed the reporter a card, "China United News Agency Employee Certificate," with "Hu Diya, 26 years old, Sichuan, Editing Director, President Zhang Cangping" written on the inside, to prove his identity. He continued, "I graduated from the journalism department of Shanghai Law College. During the Anti-Japanese War, the school was in Wanxian. I came to Shanghai last July to find a job. Because Zhang used to teach at Shanghai Law College in Wanxian, he was now also the president of China United News Agency, so he introduced me to the agency to serve as the editing director. However, there were very few staff members in the agency, with only the editing director and two stencil writers. Since I started working in the agency until now, for about six months, I have only received a salary of 4.26 million yuan, which has made me extremely poor."

After that, Zhang Cangping returned to his hometown to run for election, and the agency's affairs were handled by Vice President Song Haiping, who also lived in the agency (No. 42, Lane 10, Qiujiang Branch Road). Due to a misunderstanding over the issue of sending out manuscripts, Song developed a bad impression of me. I also thought about going to Hankou to find another job and borrowed 2 million yuan from Song for travel expenses. Song did not agree to lend it, so I asked to sell the old newspapers stored in the agency to use the proceeds as travel expenses, but Song also refused. Because I was stranded in a foreign land with no relatives or friends to turn to, I borrowed nothing. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, taking advantage of Song's absence from the agency, I loaded 108 catties of old newsprint and 58.5 catties of local newspapers stored in the agency onto a rickshaw and sold them for 2.13 million yuan. In the afternoon, I returned to the agency and said to Song with a smile, 'I'm sorry, I've sold the old newspapers.'"

Unexpectedly, Song put on a stern face at this time and called the police station, reporting me for theft. The Wujin Road Police Station transferred me to the Hongkou Police Branch. On the 4th of this month, the Hongkou Branch transferred me to the procuratorate. After questioning, the prosecutor found that the situation was not very serious and allowed bail. After being released on bail, I could not leave Shanghai to find another job, my reputation was damaged, and my pockets were empty. I could no longer live in the China United News Agency, so I stayed in a small inn. It was right during the Lunar New Year, and the drums were noisy in the streets, which increased the stimulation. I decided to commit suicide. First, under the pretext of a blood test, I asked the doctor to draw a tube of blood to write four letters in blood, one to the Journalists Association and three letters separately to Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Da Gong Bao, reporting the facts, hoping that my reputation could be maintained after my death. These four blood letters are currently stored in the procuratorate. I also bought a piece of mercury cyanide (mercurial agent), prepared for suicide when necessary.

Today (the 12th), the procuratorate summoned me and Song to court for questioning again in the morning. In court, the prosecutor advocated reconciliation. I felt that even if reconciliation, my reputation had been damaged, and after reconciliation, my life would have no sustenance. I suddenly felt that life was meaningless, so I swallowed the pre-purchased cyanide in the procuratorate, determined to commit suicide. After being discovered by the bailiffs, I was rushed to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment. This is the story of being accused of theft and attempting suicide." Because Hu had been talking for a long time, his breathing was rapid. At the end, he dug out 15,000 yuan in legal tender from his pocket and said with a bitter smile, "This is all I have left!" When the reporter walked out of Guangci Hospital, he saw that Shanghai was bathed in the New Year atmosphere of firecrackers and drums. Who would have thought that in another corner, this tragedy was being played out for "2 million yuan"?

### Four Principles for the Year-End Bonus Case for Five Industries Such as Western Clothing Are Determined

### Rumors of Opening Up Navigation Rights on the Yangtze River - Shipping Industry Rejects it as Absurd - Sees it as Malicious Propaganda Damaging Sino-US Relations

[Our Newspaper News] In recent days, it has been rumored that US aid to China will have the opening up of navigation rights on the Yangtze River as an attached condition. The person in charge of the National Federation of Shipping Industries said that this is an absurd rumor and denounced it as malicious propaganda damaging Sino-US relations. It is said that "The United States has always adopted a highly protective policy for its own shipping industry. This policy has been strengthened repeatedly in the past ten years. The funds used for shipbuilding often account for a major part of the national expenditure. Coastal and inland river navigation is limited to ships flying the American flag. Therefore, the American government and people can understand and support our people's struggle to maintain coastal and inland river navigation rights and oppose 'four-port trade' on the Yangtze River. This kind of friendship and justice has long won the resonance of the Chinese nation. Now, at a time when the Communist bandits are rampant and threatening world peace, we are in even more urgent need of the timely realization of various American spiritual and material assistance to alleviate the current scourge. This kind of assistance is based on standing together in times of trouble and jointly planning for security. There must be no conditions for exchange. In particular, 450 million people cherish the navigation rights that China has only recently recovered. The Chinese government authorities have also repeatedly stated that there is no possibility of changing the protection policy, which should be known to all friendly countries. Therefore, the current widespread rumors of opening up navigation rights on the Yangtze River, allowing ships flying foreign flags to enter unimpeded, have no signs to be found. It can be asserted that it is an atmosphere created by a few people who attempt to re-enjoy navigation privileges in China to confuse the public. We can only be more vigilant to ensure the integrity of navigation rights."

### A Dancehall Star's Enthusiasm Wanes - Two Chairmen Sun Hongyuan et al. Regain Freedom on Lunar New Year's Eve - Dance Hostesses Involved to be Transferred to the Procuratorate

The industry association chairman Sun Hongyuan and the labor union chairman Tang Zongjie (in relation to the dance hostesses and dance industry workers who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau incident) were released on bail around 2 am on the 10th morning (i.e. late on New Year's Eve in the lunar calendar) with the approval of the police bureau, after continuous requests from dancehall peers and lawyer Chen Tingrui, each putting up a reputable shop as a guarantor. As for another director of the independent labor union, Hu Yunyuan, and seven dance hostesses and 25 workers with more serious allegations, they are to be transferred to the procuratorate for trial. At that time, Sun Hongyuan and Tang Zongjie, who are out on bail, and dance hostess representatives Sun Zhimin, Jin Meihong, and Meng Yan will all be summoned to appear in court. According to reporters, since the incident of destruction occurred, the stars of each dancehall have felt a sense of decline, and many have not returned to the dance floor to resume their livelihood. Even those famous figures in the dance industry such as Meng Yan and Sun Zhimin, who represented the dance hostess petitioning group, have not returned to their original dancehalls and have secretly hidden their whereabouts, as if they were recluses in the dance world, reversing their past active situation. Therefore, although dancehalls are approaching the Spring Festival, business is not very prosperous.

### Workers Arrested at Shenxin Factory: 198 Released, Yang Guangming and Hu Binliang Admit to Joining the Communist Party, 38 Others Suspected of Serious Crimes Under Continued Interrogation

[Special Dispatch] According to yesterday's announcement by the Municipal Government Information Office: Following the labor strike at Shenxin No. 9 Factory on Macau Road, this city, over two hundred workers with suspicious behavior were arrested on the spot. Among them, 198 workers who were implicated innocently and whose offenses were relatively minor, have been released after representatives from the Shenxin No. 9 Aftermath Committee provided bail for them separately on the afternoon of the 9th. There are still 38 workers suspected of serious crimes who are being continuously interrogated by the police bureau. Among them, Yang Guangming and Hu Baoliang have admitted to being members of the Communist Party after interrogation. Their written confessions are as follows:

Yang Guangming: After Yang Guangming was arrested, the police bureau sent officers to interrogate him. The recorded transcript of the interrogation is as follows:

Name: Yang Guangming.

Age: 22 years old.

Hometown: Gaoyou.

Occupation: Coppersmith at Shenxin No. 9 Factory.

Residence: No. 16, Zone 4, Shenxin No. 9 Factory Workshop.

The person being interrogated was questioned by the preliminary hearing court of the Police Bureau on February 8th of this year regarding the Shenxin No. 9 Factory labor strike. The record is as follows:

Q: Who initiated the Shenxin No. 9 Factory labor strike?

A: To explain the reason for the Shenxin No. 9 Factory labor strike, it was because the factory stopped distributing two installments of rations. I heard that various departments had negotiated with the factory, and I, Yang Guangming, had also requested this from the chairman of the union, Mao Yuting, but there was no response. The coppersmiths all knew about this. After a week, the union and the factory had not responded, so this strike happened. There are too many departments in Shenxin No. 9 Factory, and each department had representatives participating. For example, there was Tan Xibao, and I recognize a face from the fine yarn department, but I can't say his name. There were almost more than one hundred representatives.

Q: Do you know the details of the organization of this strike?

A: Tan Xibao and others advocated for the election of representatives, Yang Changmin was in charge of leading the pickets, and I was the representative who spoke. After the machines were shut down, while preparing for the first negotiation with the factory, a Wang Zhongliang requested all the representatives to negotiate with the factory.

Q: Why did it escalate to closing the iron gates and preventing entry and exit? Who advocated this?

A: On the evening of the day the machines were shut down, which was two days before your police arrived, while we were negotiating with the factory, suddenly a person claiming to be a newspaper reporter came to Shenxin No. 9 Factory. We welcomed him very much. However, because this self-proclaimed newspaper reporter was acting mysteriously and was not prepared to conduct an interview, everyone wanted to see his identification. During the dispute, suddenly someone raised a pistol to demonstrate, so the workers were very surprised. Then, a worker named Yang Changmin snatched the gun and dragged him into the factory. I heard that Yang Changmin reported this to the Putuo Road branch office. It is said that this self-proclaimed newspaper reporter was sent by the Putuo branch office, so the iron gates were closed, and no one was allowed to enter without verifying their identity. This was advocated by someone surnamed Jin, whose name is not very clear, but I recognize his face.

Q: On the afternoon of that day, the military police and relevant authorities came to talk to you. Who opposed sending representatives out to negotiate?

A: After listening to the guidance of the officials from all sides, our worker representative, Yang Changmin, climbed over the iron gate at that time, intending to come out to negotiate, but the crowd was noisy, and some workers opposed it, so it was unsuccessful.

Q: Who designed the throwing of bricks, sprinkling nitric acid, and using tap water to attack the military police?

A: I don't know about this situation. Maybe Yang Changmin and the others know.

Q: Who directed the labor-management drama and taught the songs? Do you know?

A: I don't know this very well.

Q: What organizations have you participated in?

A: In the past, after the Chongqing Jiaochangkou incident, I was introduced by a Mr. Guo Chuhuai to join the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, I also became sworn brothers with Wang Zhongliang and 160 others. I have not participated in any other organizations.

Q: You joined the Communist Party in Chongqing and came to Shanghai to work. How did you contact them?

A: I came to Shanghai in July of 1946. I reported to the Fuzhou Road Labor Association and explained to the Labor Association that I was now working at Shenxin No. 9 Factory. After about a month, a Mr. Wang Yiming came to see me at Shenxin No. 9 Factory. At that time, he (referring to Wang) instructed me to be friendly with the workers, and if there were any good friends among the workers, to develop comrade relations as much as possible. After that, we met once a week.

Q: When was the last time you met with Wang Yiming before the Shenxin No. 9 Factory labor strike? Where did you meet him? Did he make an appointment with you for the next meeting, including the time and location?

A: The last time was two weeks ago, and I met Wang Yiming at the tram stop at the intersection of Seymour Road and Avenue Joffre. He made an appointment for me to meet him next time at the corner of Connaught Road and Jiaozhou Road, at 3 PM tomorrow (the 9th), for no more than three minutes. We will definitely meet.

Q: What does Wang Yiming look like?

A: He is a little shorter than me, not fat, not thin, and does not wear glasses. He wears student clothes and speaks with a local accent.

Q: Has Wang Yiming ever given you any instructions on how to work?

A: There were no specific instructions on work, but he asked me about the recent situation at Shenxin No. 9 Factory, and talked to me about the recent battles of the Communist army, as well as the recent student parades for the Hong Kong and Kowloon incident, which were completely patriotic movements, and that the government's repression was regrettable!

Q: Who introduced you to work at Shenxin No. 9 Factory?

A: My brother-in-law, Mei Wenkui, introduced me to Minister Ding of the Shenxin Factory.

Q: Where is your brother-in-law Mei Wenkui now?

A: He (referring to Mei) is also a coppersmith at Shenxin No. 9 Factory. He entered the factory with me after the victory. He (referring to Mei) is a relative of Minister Ding.

Q: After you entered Shenxin No. 9 Factory, how many comrade relations did you develop?

A: We need the following conditions to develop comrade relations:

(1) Must be literate, (2) Must be gentle, (3) Must have social awareness, (4) Must understand the international situation, (5) Must be able to keep secrets. There are too few people who meet the standards, so it was not until two months ago that I developed a comrade relationship with Hu Baoliang.

Q: Have you ever informed Wang Yiming that you developed a comrade with Hu Baoliang? Did Hu Baoliang fill out an application to join the party? Or a voluntary statement?

A: Hu Baoliang wrote a voluntary statement, which I have already handed over to Wang Yiming.

Q: Has Wang Yiming met with Hu Baoliang?

A: Not yet. Wang Yiming has not made an appointment with him.

Hu Binliang: Name: Hu Baoliang, 24 years old, Wuxi, worker in the coppersmith department of Shenxin No. 9 Factory. Address: No. 16, Zone 4 Workshop.

Q: Why did you join the Communist Party?

A: Because Yang Guangming, the representative of our coppersmiths, persuaded me to join.

Q: When did you join?

A: Half a month ago.

Q: When you joined the Communist Party, what did Yang Guangming give you?

A: Yang Guangming gave me a piece of paper with the main points of an autobiography, and told me to write it well within half a month and hand it to him, so I could join the Communist Party.

Q: Have you now handed over your autobiography to Yang Guangming?

A: Because I didn’t understand the meaning, Yang Guangming first wrote the main points on my autobiography paper, and I wrote an autobiography according to the main points and handed it to Yang Guangming. Yang Guangming then thought it was okay, so he returned the autobiography to me.

Q: Are there any other procedures?

A: No.

Q: Is this sheet of autobiography main points written with a pencil, which is Yang Guangming written for you?

A: Yes, Yang Guangming wrote it and handed it to me.

Q: Are these few sheets of autobiography written with foreign ink, written by you personally?

A: I wrote it myself, half a month ago.

Q: Where did you hand over your autobiography?

A: I handed it to him in Room 16, Zone 4 Workshop, after work in the factory.

### Public Water and Land Transportation New Prices Approved: Ferry and Small Train Prices Adjusted Yesterday, Tram and Bus Prices Effective on the 15th

The prices for public transportation in this city for this month, including trams, buses, small trains, and ferries, were recently reviewed and approved by Director Zhao Zengjue of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, along with staff from the relevant departments, and three councilors including Jiang Hao, head of the Public Works Group of the Council, and Zhu Yizhi and Tang Chengzong. The prices were carefully calculated based on the relevant indices for the past month using the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities, and then submitted to the mayor for approval by Director Zhao. The new prices for ferries and small trains have been implemented since yesterday. The new prices for trams and buses will be implemented on the 15th. The new prices are listed below:

Trams: Third class: 2,000 to 7,000 yuan; First class: 4,000 to 11,000 yuan. Up 23% from last month.

Buses: 4,000 to 14,000 yuan. Up 30% from last month.

For buses, if calculated based on the actual fare in January, the increase should be 64%, but the new price is only increased by 30%. For small trains, if calculated based on the actual fare in January, the increase should be 43%, but the new price is only increased by 25%. For ferries, if calculated based on the actual fare in January, the increase should be 143%, but the new price is only increased by 29%.

### Prelude to the Spring Festival: The Tārā Monastery Lantern Festival Temporarily Suspended

[Special Dispatch from Lanzhou, 8th of the Month] The people of the Northwest are deeply attached to celebrating the Lunar New Year. The government, following the regulations of the Central Farmers' Day, is expanding the celebrations. A security meeting was convened by the Social Affairs Bureau a few days ago, resolving that all government offices, schools, organizations, and businesses should uniformly display flags on that day to mark the occasion. The Executive Headquarters and the Provincial Government will have a one-day holiday. The Municipal Farmers' Association and citizens will be mobilized to perform community fire performances for three days on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of February. The Agricultural Improvement Institute, Agricultural School, People's Education Center, Animal Epidemic Prevention Office, Wool Improvement Office, Science Education Museum, and other institutions will prepare an agricultural product exhibition and various farming competitions. The theaters and cinemas will provide free performances to farmers on the 25th and 26th.

Another significant measure is the Spring Festival troop support, also initiated by the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition to soliciting donations, Spring Festival couplets are being printed for charity sale, with a minimum price of 300,000 yuan per pair. The fundraising target for consolation money is 1 billion yuan. As soon as the resolution was passed yesterday, the Gansu Provincial Bank immediately donated 50 million yuan, the Gansu Trading Company donated 30 million yuan, and the Lanzhou Municipal Bank also donated 20 million yuan. Other industrial and commercial banks are also contributing enthusiastically. The Spring Festival couplets for charity sale are currently being printed overnight. Chai Ruoyu, Chairman of the Provincial Farmers' Association, has already pre-purchased the first three pairs for 1.5 million yuan. Currently, the troop support work is in full swing.

Amid the promotion of frugality and the prohibition of gift-giving, a large advertisement for a "Spring Festival Grand Competition" was found in a local newspaper in the city. Upon closer reading, it stated, "In order to improve the quality of our products, our store has recently hired a new type of technician from Shanghai, specializing in the production of Southern candies, biscuits, pastries, bread, and various New Year cakes. We have newly installed biscuit machines and scientific baking ovens, spending hundreds of millions, with the intention of achieving successful improvements. We are preparing for a year-end food grand competition. We humbly request..." As early as half a month ago, the authorities routinely "prohibited gift-giving" on paper. However, in reality, not only are the display windows of food stores piled high with gifts, but some people are also launching a "grand competition" for manufacturing gifts, ostensibly to promote it. Is this intentional irony? Someone suggested in the newspaper that the police and military should confiscate gifts on the streets and donate them to veterans and civilians. The idea is good, but what about "actions not matching words"?

Lantern Festival Not Held to Celebrate the Completion of Suppressing the Rebellion

The annual Shangyuan Lantern Festival at Tārā Monastery will be temporarily suspended this year. According to reliable information obtained by reporters from relevant parties: the Lantern Festival this year is approaching rapidly. According to religious rituals, the Living Buddhas of the monastery must perform divination before the Buddha to determine the preparations for this year's Lantern Festival. The divination results indicate that this year's Lantern Festival should focus on praying and chanting scriptures, and the butter lamp festival need not be held on a large scale. Based on this instruction, the Living Buddhas also considered that the monastery sent monks out to solicit donations last year, and the amount of alms received was not significant. Furthermore, the country has suffered from the war with the Japanese invaders and the communist bandits for many years, and the national economy is strained. Therefore, in accordance with the state's will to conserve consumption, they unanimously agreed to simplify this year's Shangyuan Festival butter lamp festival at the monastery. Only a small-scale lantern festival will be held in the Grand Sutra Hall on that day, with monks sincerely chanting scriptures to pray for the early success of suppressing the rebellion and the early achievement of peace and unification in the country. The large butter lamp racks that were set up in previous years will be temporarily suspended to comply with the state's will for frugality. The Living Buddha representatives and stewards sent by the monastery recently went to Xining to report everything to the authorities. The Qinghai Provincial Government also believes that the monastery's Lantern Festival has already been determined by the Living Buddhas' divination, which not only does not contradict the religious significance but also greatly supports this act of saving consumption and praying for peace and unification. Therefore, the spokesman for the monastery's Khenpo Office has officially announced to the public: "The annual Shangyuan Lantern Festival is determined by sincere prayer before the Buddha in advance. This year, the divination indicates that a small-scale lantern festival and expanded chanting of scriptures should be the principle. The public has followed the Buddha's will and plans to hold Buddhist events in the Grand Sutra Hall of the monastery from the fourth day of the first lunar month, which means lecturing on scriptures and praying for the success of suppressing the rebellion. According to the religious rules, its significance is even greater than holding a large-scale lantern festival."

To Visit Tārā Monastery, You Must Know Tsongkhapa

Anyone who has been to the Northwest must consider it an honor to visit Tārā Monastery. The annual Shangyuan Festival butter lamp festival is particularly grand and famous. Therefore, every festival season, all believers travel thousands of miles to worship and express their piety. People at home and abroad who admire the magnificent architecture of the monastery and yearn for the exquisite craftsmanship of the butter lamps also travel long distances to witness this grand event.

When was Tārā Monastery completed? How does it have such great magic to attract millions of people? To answer these questions, one must start with the life story of the Great Master Tsongkhapa.

The Great Master Tsongkhapa was born on the 25th day of the tenth month of the 26th year of the Ming Dynasty's Hongwu reign (Guiyou year) at the original site of Tārā Monastery, 29 kilometers southwest of Xining City, Qinghai. At that time, this place was the nomadic residence of the Tsongkhapa family. His father was Lubumge, and his mother was named Xiangsha Ache. After the master was born, the blood from cutting the umbilical cord dripped on the ground, and the next year, a sandalwood tree grew, with images of the lion's roar Buddha on each leaf, totaling ten thousand. (Tibetan name: Kumbum) Therefore, people from far and near thought it was extraordinary, and more and more people came to worship. Because the Tibetan name for the Huangshui River is Zongqu, the master was named Tsongkhapa.

The master was exceptionally intelligent at the age of three and studied with Domarawa Yedoje. At the age of seven, he took Dorje Rinchen as his teacher, became a monk, received novice vows, and deeply studied Buddhism. At the age of seventeen, the master, seeing that the Buddhist monks at that time were gradually becoming heretical, and the precepts were corrupt, and the rules were gone, resolutely resolved to reform. He took the role of Buddhism's Martin Luther as his own and went to Tibet for further study. In Tibet, he personally built Dadeng Temple, reformed and innovated the new religion, and his followers wore yellow robes and yellow hats, so people called it the Yellow Sect. The master promoted Buddhism in Tibet and passed away on the 25th day of the tenth month of the 15th year of the Chenghua reign (Jihai year), at the age of seventy-five.

Grateful for the Master's Grace, Build Tārā Monastery

After the Great Master Tsongkhapa went to Tibet, during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, local people, to commemorate the master, built a pagoda next to the sandalwood tree, with a Buddhist niche above, and enshrined a golden statue of the master inside, as a place for people from far and near to worship. This is the current Great Golden Tile Temple. Later, it gradually expanded, including the Small Golden Tile Temple, large and small scripture halls, and other one hundred and eight temples, as well as countless monks' residences and Buddhist houses, lining the mountain gully, very clean. The Living Buddhas of Qinghai each have their own Gariva. The Qinghai Provincial Government also has guest houses for receiving tourists. The Tenth Panchen Lama also resides in the "Angqian Courtyard" on the hillside.

Butter Lamps Lit Together, Believers All Worship

Every year on the night of the Shangyuan Festival, Tārā Monastery must present butter lamps, sculpting Buddha statues, landscapes, palaces, flowers, birds, and animals out of butter, adding colors to make them lifelike. Sculpting begins after the Mid-Autumn Festival each year, and the method is kept secret. On the evening of the Shangyuan Festival, they are displayed in several places for competition. The lamp sheds are built near the Grand Sutra Hall, reaching more than three zhang (about 10 meters) in height. Both sides are decorated with colorful silk embroidery of various Buddhist stories and patterns, adorned with pendants and tassels, which are extremely splendid. Dozens of glass lanterns hang from the top of the shed. In front of the shed, two wooden frames are set up, erecting triangular arches. Butter sculptures of Buddha statues and objects are embedded on the arches. Below, three rows of small brass lamps are arranged, about two or three hundred lamps. After the bright moon rises, hundreds of oil lamps are lit, emitting a faint yellow flame, illuminating the colored butter sculptures above, like a magnificent three-dimensional landscape painting, vivid and unusual, making the viewers feel like they are in a dream. The believers prostrate themselves and worship.

After midnight, the butter statues and lamps are all removed. The next day, at dawn, there is no trace of the lantern festival left. It is said that the meaning of presenting the lanterns is a reproduction of a dream of the Great Master Tsongkhapa, so there is nothing left after dawn. Some people also say that the master shows the scenery of the Western Paradise to strengthen the piety of the believers. However, according to the explanation of people in the religion, it is to commemorate Shakyamuni Buddha, who fought against the Brahmins for faith in the past, from the first day of the first lunar month to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, and defeated the Brahmins. Therefore, later disciples presented lanterns once every year on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month to commemorate the final victory. (Our reporter Song Lin)

### Spring Festival in Hangzhou: Divining Fate? Sightseeing?

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 11th of the Month] Before the Spring Festival, the trains from Shanghai to Hangzhou were packed like sardines. Some people even climbed in through the windows? Some even climbed on the train skin, and even the small train toilets were full of people. Although the railway bureau added special trains for returning home, it still could not disperse such a large population. Pan Ming, the stationmaster of Hangzhou Railway Station, told me that in the few days before the Spring Festival, there were always 40,000 passengers from Shanghai to Hangzhou every day, but only 4,000 from Hangzhou to Shanghai. The ticket inspectors on the train could not even find a place to stand. Third-class passengers ran into first class, and first-class passengers were satisfied even if they found a place to stay in third class. I remember last year's Hangzhou Spring Incense Pilgrimage was unprecedentedly lively, with only 11,000 passengers from Shanghai to Hangzhou. The returning home trains the year before last were only 20,000 passengers per day. This year, it broke all previous records. Why is this? These are difficult years tormenting the wanderers struggling in foreign lands. They are seeking a moment of comfort, a moment of warmth. In today's world, where everywhere is cold and bleak, only returning home, kissing the white hair of their kind mothers, hugging their young children, and kissing the familiar hometown can be considered the only comfort.

A Day of Good Sunshine Shines on West Lake

The Spring Festival has arrived. A rare day of good sunshine shines on West Lake. From 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM, the roads, especially Hubin Road, are crowded with men and women. The bicycles in the bicycle shops are all rented out. Chartered buses carry people to Lingyin or Nanshan. Some trucks temporarily put up a few benches, carrying people for sightseeing around the lake. More than half of the crowd are from the countryside. They wear red and green, new clothes and new socks. They devoutly celebrate this Lunar New Year. Toy vendors sell toys along the street, and the prices are twice as high as usual. The prices of rickshaws and tricycles are also twice as high. The boats in West Lake charge 20,000 yuan per person from Hubin to Zhongshan Park. As long as the buyers say "Get rich, get blessed," the employers are happy to accept without hesitation.

Beishan and Tianzhu Compete to Burn the First Incense

In this year, "getting rich" is still a great joy. Under the turmoil of world affairs, national affairs, family affairs, and personal affairs, hardship and difficulty are pressing on everyone's heart. They can only pray for the blessing of the gods. The lively situation in the three Tianzhu temples in Beishan during the Spring Festival far exceeds last year's spring pilgrimage. Just talking about burning the first incense, there are hundreds of people. Afterwards, the Tianzhu Road is full of traffic, and the incense smoke in the Tianzhu Temple surrounds the roof. People who burn incense silently pray, hoping that the merciful and compassionate Guanyin Bodhisattva will bless them! They seek lottery and hope to get a "superior" one.

In the main hall of Shangtianzhu, Maitreya outside the mountain gate is in a not-so-glorious house. The monks take advantage of people's requests from the Bodhisattva, and they also reach out to the pious men and women. Because they hope the Bodhisattva will bestow more blessings, they are also happy to donate generously.

Jinhua General Temple: Candles Cannot Be Pulled Out

The Jinhua General Temple in Yongjinmen is even more lively. It is so crowded that there is no way to add more people in the temple. Pilgrims are still crowding into the temple. The candles that have just been inserted are pulled out by another person who comes to worship. Another person pulls them out again for the same reason. Seven or eight pairs of large candles are burning brightly. The Taoists came up with a method and temporarily piled incense, candles, paper ingots, etc. on the street into ten stalls, lit them up, and the fire was warm. The people watching and burning incense crowded this large road. It is said that General Jinhua was a great general of the Ming Dynasty who died for defending the city. Later generations respected him as a god, and it is said that he is in charge of wealth. Therefore, those seeking wealth are eager to be the first. It is also said that General Jinhua is extraordinarily intelligent and answers all requests. During the Spring Festival, those who go to ask General Jinhua include men and women from the countryside and fashionable girls from the city, all asking to be blessed with wealth. Chenghuang Mountain is also the most lively, where there are ten palaces of Yama, in charge of everyone's fate. Therefore, everyone has to worship Yama, especially the little devils next to Yama, who need to be carefully served. No matter how sad the world is, there are always more people who are fascinated by this world than those who hate this world. Without the means to change the world, they use gods and mysteries to entrust their own life experiences. Although this has been a product of thousands of years, what method can China, which is constantly in turmoil, use to lead them to a different path? The fortune tellers on Chenghuang Mountain also seized the opportunity, using the slogan of being able to determine your life's fortune and misfortune, and sure enough, those who came to ask for advice flocked to them.

Tourists are also Crowded at Jade Emperor Mountain

Other places such as Wangshan, Liuhe Pagoda, and Hupao Spring are also crowded with tourists, but not as prosperous as Tianzhu, Jinhua General Temple, and Chenghuang Mountain. During this Spring Festival season, there are definitely more people who divine their fate than those who go sightseeing. An old Hangzhou native smiled and told me: "Look, spring has already come. The willow tips are already turning green, the spring plum blossoms are already blooming, and the peach blossoms already have buds. This year's incense pilgrimage will be even more lively than last year due to the inspiration of the Spring Festival homecoming." Yes, look at the temples in the scenic area and the shops by the lake. They are all shaking off their spirits to welcome their happy and good business days. (Our special correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Famous Guangzhou Flowers Without Owners, Prices are Doubled

[Air Dispatch from Guangzhou, 7th of the Month] The situation in Guangzhou is deteriorating rapidly. According to a business leader: "Out of the 24,430 stores in Guangzhou, about 5,000 are closing down or selling due to their inability to survive the New Year, accounting for one-fifth of the total." The tragic situation can be imagined.

The first graduates of the Guangzhou dance girl retraining class have no jobs to switch to. Since it happens to be the festive season, the dance halls "urgently need talent," so they have "switched" back to the fiery scene to be active. In recent days, Shanghai and Hong Kong dance girls have come to Guangzhou one after another, and the dance hall scene here is booming. With the Spring Festival approaching, all industries are depressed, but street flowers alone have doubled in price. Each large peach blossom branch is priced at 18 million yuan, each peony pot at 3 million yuan, and narcissus at 200,000 yuan. Flower sellers fill the streets, and flower buyers also fill the streets. Famous flowers and dance girls each have their own value. The authorities are determined to crack down on smugglers on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, especially with the New Year approaching and smuggling being the most rampant. A large number of military police have been dispatched to increase the number of personnel stationed in Shiling Shenzhen, the channel for smugglers to enter and exit. More than a thousand smugglers have been arrested in recent days and will be sent to Hainan Island and the Northeast to "develop the border." Also, because smugglers take the train and often climb on top of the cars without buying tickets, in order to eliminate these people, it has been decided to install water dragons on the water towers at major stations along the route. When the trains arrive at the station, if people are found on the roof, they will be sprayed with water. It has also been decided to "try the new method" on the Lunar New Year. Many of these smugglers are unemployed soldiers who take risks to make a living. There have been repeated reports of suicides due to the loss of their capital and the inability to make a living.

This: Talking Peace Now is Suicide

At 10:50 p.m. in 1940, the telephone in my apartment rang. It was Ambassador Cudahy in Brussels, telling me in an agitated voice that a large number of German aircraft were crossing Luxembourg and flying towards Belgium, and that they also seemed to be appearing over the Netherlands. Cudahy also told me that a large number of German troops were massing on the borders of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, and that the Belgian side expected the German army to attack around dawn.

I called the President and told him the news Cudahy had given me, and then called several colleagues in the State Department. I arrived at the office a little after eleven o'clock, a little earlier than everyone else. I immediately called several important capitals in Europe. When I got through to Cudahy, he told me that Luxembourg had been invaded, that German planes were bombing the airfield near Bruxelles, and that German forces seemed ready to attack Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg simultaneously.

But more dangerous than the successful German attack on Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg was the telegram that Ambassador Bullitt sent to the President and me on May 15th, which said that the German army, led by a large number of tank units and dive bombers, had already broken through the French lines at Sedan. Prime Minister Reynaud called Churchill and said that once the German army had broken through, the war would be beyond salvation in a few days. According to Reynaud, unless Britain immediately sent its fighter squadrons from the United Kingdom to France, the war was over. Churchill promised to raise this prescient matter within the war cabinet, but resolutely said over the phone that the war was not beyond salvation. Reynaud replied that Churchill should know that when Reynaud was Prime Minister, France was determined to fight to the end.

On the same day, May 15th, Ambassador Kennedy sent a telegram to the President and me, telling us about a sensational conversation he had just had with Churchill. The Prime Minister said that if Italy entered the war, he thought the chances of the Allies winning were slim. Churchill said that France was asking for more troops to be sent, but he was unwilling to send people out of Britain at this time, because he firmly believed that Britain would soon be subject to fierce attack within a month. Churchill also said he wanted us to lend him thirty or forty old destroyers, as well as any planes we could spare.

The President and I had no doubt that the victory of the Allied powers was necessary for the security of the United States. The President quickly reviewed this issue and immediately decided to collect every available warplane and transport it to France. On May 14th, Bullitt telegraphed me, suggesting that France send an aircraft carrier to transport them. After consulting with the President, I replied the next day that due to the provisions of international law and the status of the United States, it was impossible to load these planes in New York, but they could be flown to a port on the east coast of Canada first, possibly Halifax, and then loaded there. This was done—but it was too late to transport them to France.

The President knew and fully understood that the advantage shown by the German army in occupying the Netherlands and breaking through Sedan in a blitzkrieg required us to fully estimate the task of revitalizing American armaments. The President and I discussed a plan to submit a special message to Congress, requesting that military appropriations for that year be effectively doubled, a point I fully agreed with. On May 13th, Bullitt sent a telegram to me, asking it to be forwarded to the President, which strongly argued that, due to the important role played by aircraft in the German advance, it was necessary to increase aircraft production. So I suggested to the President that the United States should aim to produce 50,000 aircraft per year. Before that, I had mentioned this number to my colleagues. Mr. Stettinius's reaction was the same as my colleagues'—he was speechless, because 50,000 aircraft was ten times the current annual production. But I argued that it would be most appropriate to set a larger number and a far-reaching goal. Such a production volume did not seem as impossible to me as it did to others. I felt that simply raising this number, coupled with our country's vast production capacity known throughout the world, would have a good effect in inspiring our own people, comforting the Allies, and making the Axis powers wary.

The President then expressed his agreement. On May 16th, in a message to Congress, he said he hoped the country would step up production to produce 50,000 aircraft per year. He requested additional appropriations for the various departments of the armed forces, totaling $1.182 billion. Subsequently, Prime Minister Reynaud began to send the President a series of extraordinary, almost hysterical appeals. The French Prime Minister was obviously shocked and agitated by the German army's astonishing victory, which is quite understandable. But what he was asking for was impossible. On May 18th, the Secretary-General of the French Foreign Ministry, Léger, notified Ambassador Bullitt that Reynaud intended to make a personal appeal to the President that night, asking whether Mr. Roosevelt could obtain a declaration of war against Germany from Congress. Bullitt telegraphed the President and me, saying that he had replied to Léger that such an appeal would not only be useless, but would have even worse consequences. The President would not ask Congress to declare war against Germany, and Congress would almost certainly oppose a declaration of war. Bullitt frankly pointed out that if Reynaud had to make such an appeal, it would only be a matter of record, so that one day Reynaud could show that he had appealed to the President of the United States, and the President had refused. Bullitt said to Léger that this approach, in his view, was not only unworthy of Britain, France, and even the United States, but that the current situation was too serious for the three governments to engage in anything other than frank dealings.

The President and I agreed that Bullitt's reply to Léger reflected our views.

That night, Bullitt went to see Reynaud in person, who said he wanted to send us a formal note.

Bullitt told us his opinion that Reynaud had not come up with a solution to the matter and had decided to send a fake note as a record. This decision had been prevented by Bullitt's conversation with Léger that afternoon. After the President and I discussed Reynaud and Bullitt's conversation, the President called Bullitt and told him that things of this nature were out of the question. Bullitt immediately conveyed this to Reynaud.

On May 22nd, Bullitt telegraphed the President and me again, saying that Reynaud told him that he would not let the matter drop. This was now of greater importance than it had been four days earlier when he had last discussed the matter. France had received news from Italy and Sweden that if Germany won another major victory in the current battle in northern France, Hitler intended to offer France a separate and generous peace.

Reynaud said that if Hitler made such a suggestion at a time of extreme despair in France, there was a great danger that the French public would tend to accept it. Reynaud himself admitted that such acceptance was tantamount to suicide, just as Czechoslovakia had given up the Sudetenland in 1938. From then on, France would live under the German iron heel, and as soon as Hitler deemed it convenient, he would occupy all of France just as he had occupied all of Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, Germany's victory over Britain would follow in a few weeks. Then Reynaud believed that within a few months German soldiers and thousands of planes would arrive in South America, the Panama Canal would be bombed, and American troops would not be able to put up much resistance.

He believed that no American aid other than a declaration of war would be sufficient to save France and Britain. If we could not give military aid beyond the limits of a declaration of war, we would have to deal with the Germans in America. The military situation in France was rapidly deteriorating. In the face of the obvious and understandable situation in France, I held many meetings in my office with my colleagues, asking them to consider the various possibilities of the development of the European war, paying particular attention to their impact on the United States and the Western Hemisphere. We reached a general conclusion that the position of the Allied forces was already extremely difficult, and that our attention should be focused on preserving the British and French fleets so that they would not fall into Hitler's hands.

The President agreed to make a direct appeal to the British and French governments on the naval issue. We immediately drafted a telegram, which was sent on May 26th. In a telegram to Bullitt, I said that the President wanted him to explain to Reynaud and Daladier that while we still hoped that the German invasion could be prevented, if the situation deteriorated, we believed that the preservation of the French fleet was important for the restoration of France and its colonies, for the control of the seas, and for France to obtain more lenient peace terms. We expressed the same view on the issue of the British fleet in our communication to the British government. On May 20th, Churchill telegraphed the President, emphasizing the danger faced by Britain, and saying that if the United Kingdom were conquered by Hitler, the only thing with which to negotiate a treaty with Germany would be the fleet. The President also mentioned this point in his telegram to Churchill. He suggested to Churchill that if the situation deteriorated, the British fleet could retreat to Canada, and guaranteed that the United States would never allow Germany or any other non-American country to seize Canada or other British possessions in the Western Hemisphere. As long as the British and French fleets could be kept intact, Germany could not win the war except within Europe.

Reynaud's appeals were now becoming more intense. Bullitt telegraphed us on May 28th, stating that Reynaud proposed that the President of the French Republic and the King of England issue a joint appeal to the President. When Bullitt saw Reynaud, he had already written a sentence, saying: "The army fighting for the world is being stabbed in the back."

Reynaud said that he knew that even if we declared war on Germany tomorrow, we would not be able to airlift troops to France, because such aircraft did not exist. But we had a fleet. The Atlantic Fleet should be sent to the Mediterranean immediately. This action could at least prevent another stabbing in the back, this time from Mussolini.

After completing its Dunkirk evacuation, Britain indicated to France that it could no longer send aircraft to the continent. The British Ambassador to France told Bullitt that the destruction rate of aircraft in combat was so high that if Britain sent its remaining aircraft over, there would be nothing left in two weeks. Since there no longer seemed to be any hope of saving France or even the French army, it seemed better to keep the aircraft in Britain in preparation for the impending Battle of Britain. In response to Reynaud's almost pitiful appeal, the President urged Churchill to send aircraft to France, but the Prime Minister refused. Bullitt was outraged by this decision, and reported to the President and me on June 5th that Britain might be preserving its air force and navy as bargaining chips in negotiations with Hitler.

But the President and I did not think so. We knew that France was finished, but we believed that Britain, under Churchill's indomitable leadership, wanted to continue fighting.

The idea of ​​peace terms with Germany now occupied the attention of the French cabinet. Telegrams from Bullitt increasingly reflected that France's surrender was only a matter of days away. The German army was advancing rapidly towards Paris. On June 10th, the French government moved to Tours.

On that day, Mussolini declared war on France and Britain.

### Five Million School-Age Children Need One Million Elementary School Classes: Ministry of Education Establishes Policy Principles to Improve National Normal School Education

[Special Dispatch from Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] Since the implementation of national education, the most challenging issue has been the lack of teachers. It is estimated that there are approximately 50 million school-age children nationwide. Assuming 50 students per class, at least one million elementary school classes are needed to accommodate everyone. If each class requires 1.5 teachers, at least 1.5 million teachers are needed (or 2 million if folk education classes are also run, with 2 teachers per class). According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, there are currently 650,000 national teachers nationwide. Regardless of whether current teachers are qualified, at least one million additional teachers are needed to popularize national education. Furthermore, according to Ministry of Education statistics, it would take over 3,000 years for existing normal schools to train one million teachers. Actively developing normal education and improving its facilities to meet practical needs is currently the most important task. To this end, the Ministry of Education has formulated the following policy principles:

50,000 Normal School Graduates Annually

(1) Central and provincial/municipal governments should pay special attention to the development of normal education when developing secondary education. Until normal education has developed to a substantial level, the development of ordinary middle schools can be temporarily restricted. The scale of normal school development should ensure a ratio of at least one normal school student for every one hundred school-age children. If there are 50 million school-age children nationwide, there should be at least 500,000 normal school students. If 50,000 graduate annually, accounting for 10% of the total number of teachers needed, it may barely meet the needs of newly established schools and fill vacancies due to retirement and death. In this way, the quality of national teachers can be generally improved after ten years. (2) The development of normal education should prioritize establishing more normal schools and women's normal schools. Currently, simplified normal schools can still be widely established, with at least one in each county. In the future, efforts should be made to gradually convert them into normal schools or women's normal schools within three years. The duration of study in simplified normal schools cannot be less than four years, and the minimum admission age is fifteen.

Teachers and Students Jointly Operate National Education Demonstration Zones

(3) The curriculum of normal schools and simplified normal schools should be revised in consideration of actual needs. Teaching in all subjects in normal schools should focus on the research of teaching materials and methods, as well as guidance in practical exercises. Special attention should be paid to internships. Each normal school should also designate an area as a national education internship or demonstration zone, operated jointly by teachers and students, to increase students' practical experience in national education. (4) The treatment of normal school students in school must be improved. In addition to ensuring that food meets their nutritional needs, books, supplies, uniforms, and other necessary expenses must also be provided. (5) Following the example of France before the war, normal school graduates should serve in education for at least ten years and should not be allowed to delay service for any reason. During their service, they should receive higher salaries in national education. After serving for a certain period, those who aspire to educational administrative work may also be selected and appointed.

Vacation Travel Allowed After Five Years of Service

(6) Normal school graduates who have completed their service period and have excellent service records and aspire to further education may be recommended to normal colleges for further study in national education, tuition-free and without examination, after completing five years of service. After graduation, they must still engage in national education administration or national education undertakings, but they must receive higher salaries compared to educational administrators and secondary school teachers. Those who do not pursue further education will be granted a one-year sabbatical after five years of service to conduct research and study outside the province or abroad. During the sabbatical, they will continue to receive their original salary and receive a travel allowance. After the sabbatical, they will return to their original positions and continue to serve, with a sabbatical of one year every five years.

### Education Briefs

Since Yang Deyuan took over as principal of Wudong Junior Middle School on Dongchang Road, Pudong, he has made major reforms, adding a large number of instruments, specimens, and books. Enrollment of new students this semester has been very enthusiastic, and plans are being made to expand classrooms.

The sixth issue of "Insurance Knowledge Weekly," edited by Shao Jing and published by Pan Zhongtong, has been published, containing many famous works such as Sun Ruihuang's "Insurance and Banks."

The Shanghai Municipal Drama School is currently rehearsing Yi Pu Sheng's famous play "Ghost," which is scheduled to be performed on the Drama Festival on the 15th of this month to entertain people in the drama circle.

The school buildings of the Third Remedial National School in the Thirtieth District of this city suffered severe damage during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, with the support of local people, they have now been fully restored.

### End of Tongji University Student Unrest: Ministry of Education Cables Thanks to Senators, Orders Expulsion of One Hundred Students; Transferring to Other Schools Encounters Difficulties

[Reported by this newspaper] Twenty-four institutions and organizations, including the Shanghai Municipal Senate, previously sent telegrams to the Chairman of the National Government, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, and the Minister of Education regarding the Tongji University student unrest and the case of Mayor Wu being insulted, requesting that the school's atmosphere be rectified and the perpetrators severely punished. It is now learned that Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua replied a few days ago, saying: "Your telegram has been respectfully received. Your concern for education is deeply appreciated! This time, Tongji University students, disregarding the student union rules promulgated by the Ministry, arbitrarily established an illegal department representative assembly. Initially, they insulted teachers, and then threatened to strike. Principal Ding of the school had no choice but to expel the ringleaders in order to rectify school discipline. However, these students became even more arrogant and intensified their actions, attempting to collectively petition in Nanjing. Mayor Wu personally went to dissuade them, but was instead beaten and insulted. Such blatant disregard for the law is extremely distressing! After receiving the report, the Ministry immediately dispatched Vice Minister Hang Liewu to Shanghai to personally express condolences to Mayor Wu, and to carry a dissolution order. The original intention was to dissolve the assembly immediately, but after consulting with Mayor Wu, although Mayor Wu initially agreed, he later stated that there were practical difficulties in its implementation, and strongly advocated for continued guidance. Therefore, the school's prepared announcement had to be halted from being posted, and the Ministry's order could not be carried out. The Ministry could only respect the opinions of the local authorities. Therefore, the school was ordered to thoroughly reorganize, investigate the students who caused trouble, and severely punish them accordingly. Those whose circumstances were serious were to be expelled from school, and those who violated criminal law were to be handed over to the court for separate handling. It was also found that students from other schools participated in the incident, which was obviously a consistent conspiracy by traitors and bandits to instigate strikes and market closures in order to expand the incident, deliberately disrupting the measures to maintain social order during the suppression of rebellion, and ultimately opposing the government. Their ulterior motives are clear and not comparable to ordinary student unrest. The Ministry immediately issued a notice to all colleges and universities that evening, instructing them to pay attention to the facts of the incident, investigate and strictly restrain them to prevent any disturbance, and ordered Shanghai colleges and universities to thoroughly investigate and severely punish the perpetrators. Your council and others have upheld justice and are enthusiastic about education. Thank you again for your cooperation and please continue to support and provide guidance."

[Reported by this newspaper] One hundred students who were ordered to withdraw from Tongji University a few days ago have not yet completely left the school. It is reported that many of these one hundred students are from bandit areas, and there is currently no suitable place for them to go. The certificates of study issued to each student by the school indicate that the main foreign language studied at the school is German, while other universities in the country study English textbooks, making it extremely difficult to transfer. They plan to orally request the Ministry of Education to provide relief.

### British Aid to China Movement Funds Chinese Students

[British News Agency, London, 12th] The United Aid China Association of Great Britain has recently launched an active aid to China movement. Cinemas across the country have enthusiastically participated, raising £25,000. The authorities have now decided to use these funds to cultivate Chinese sociology talents. It is understood that the list of 20 students has been submitted to the relevant authorities for review. Once approved, scholarships can begin on June 1.

### Army Games Divided into Ten District Preliminary Selections: Preliminary Selections in Each District Must Be Completed by Deadline; Headquarters Sends Liu Changge to Chongqing by Air

### 5-1: Hong Kong Team Wins Big: Inter-Port Football Match, Shanghai Team Suffers Crushing Defeat, Huang Mao Guan Ao and Yan Shixin Underperform, Disorganized Formation, Zhang Chenbang Best

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 10th] In today's Shanghai-Hong Kong inter-port football match, the Hong Kong team defeated the Shanghai team by a score of 5-1. The Hong Kong team won 2-1 in the first half, and scored three more goals in the second half. The Shanghai team's lack of coordination and the Hong Kong team's tight defense were the main reasons for the Shanghai team's defeat. Zhang Banglun was the best player on the team. Huang Mao Roberts was tightly marked by the Hong Kong team and could not perform to his best. Sun Jinshun injured his leg and was less active in the second half. Zou Wenzhi was the most active for the Hong Kong team. The Shanghai team's only goal was scored by Fei Chunhua.

[Guoguang Agency, Hong Kong, 10th] The Shanghai representative team arrived in Hong Kong in four batches by ship and plane. The game was held here today, and the atmosphere at the stadium was very lively. As a result, the Shanghai team was defeated 1-5. The Hong Kong team led 2-1 in the first half.

The Hong Kong team had eight local players and three foreign players, while the Shanghai team had nine native-born warriors and two foreign generals. Zou Wenzhi scored the first goal for the Hong Kong team. Deng Yijie also scored. Ten minutes before the end of the first half, Fei Chunhua scored a goal for the Shanghai team, making it 2-1, Hong Kong leading. After switching sides, the Shanghai team launched a full-scale counterattack, but the Hong Kong team's defense was tight and they could not penetrate. Eight minutes later, Kini, the left forward for the Hong Kong team, scored another goal. Shortly after, Wu Qixiang caused trouble in the penalty area, and Zhu Yongqiang scored a penalty. Five minutes before the end of the game, Zou Wenzhi scored another goal, leading the Hong Kong team to a 5-1 victory and winning back the Inter-Port Silver Cup.

In this game, the Hong Kong team controlled the overall situation, with good coordination and quick advances and retreats. The Shanghai team's performance was disappointing, with slow movements and a disorganized formation. Zhang Banglun saved a penalty due to Yan Shixin's poor performance and Wu Qixiang's carelessness. The best performers were only Gao Baozheng, Hanni Bo, and Fei Chunhua.

### Adjusting the Formation, Defeating the Hualian Team

[Guoguang Agency, Hong Kong, 11th] The Shanghai Inter-Port Football Team played its second game in Hong Kong today, playing against the Hong Kong United Team in the afternoon. Because the Shanghai team's performance in yesterday's game was not ideal, the atmosphere at the stadium was not as lively as on the first day. Moreover, most fans had high expectations for the Hong Kong team to win before the game, but the reality was the opposite. The Shanghai team made major adjustments to its formation. Meng Yiliang played as center back, and partnered well with Gao Baozheng and Jing Nibo. Yan Shixin was replaced by Guan Ao, Li Yichen played as right back, and Qixiang moved to the left. Banglun saved a penalty, and the defense was solid. On the forward line, Sun Lao Jin was replaced, and Xia Tixian and Li Yao had good coordination. Fei Chunhua was lively and exquisite, and performed well. After the Hong Kong team replaced two players, their formation became disorganized. Fei Chunhua scored not long after the start of the game, giving the Shanghai team a 1-0 lead in the first half. In the second half, Fei Chunhua received a pass from Li Yao and headed the ball into the goal, leading 2-0. Shortly after, Baozheng committed a handball in the penalty area. Li Shuoyou took the penalty, but Banglun saved it. After another ten minutes, Feng Jingxiang lived up to expectations and scored a goal. After that, the two sides fell into a stalemate. In the end, the Shanghai team defeated the Hong Kong Hualian team 2-1. The Shanghai team will play against the Hong Kong West United Team on the 13th.

### Gold Control Bureau to Strengthen Management After Jewelry Stores Resume Selling Gold Ornaments; Gold Ornament Price Approximately 10 Million Yuan Per Taël

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the issue of jewelers resuming the sale of gold ornaments, newspapers have reported on it for several days. According to sources from the Gold Control Bureau: The price of gold ornaments is determined by the central government, based on the national bank's gold price (40 US dollars per tael), plus 40% for operating expenses and 20% for legitimate profit. Currently, the total value is 8.6 million yuan in legal tender per tael. The Gold Control Bureau is discussing the labor cost item with the Social Affairs Bureau, which is approximately an additional 20% of the total amount, for a total of approximately 10 million yuan per tael. According to the person in charge of the Gold Control: After jewelers resume selling gold ornaments, management of the jewelry industry will be strengthened. All relevant account books must be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification in advance, and the daily inventory and sales volume must be reported to the Gold Control Bureau for record. It is hoped that the black market for gold can be eliminated in one fell swoop. Under a strict management policy, the price of gold can be reasonably stabilized.

### Excess Silver Supply After New Year: Shanghai Stocks Turn from Weak to Stable

The rumor that the silver loan might be delayed until mid-June to resolve has caused people's hearts to rebound from fatigue to stability. Small-cap stocks have been distracted by the resumption of the jewelry industry and are very mediocre. With an oversupply of silver, white yarn transactions exceeded red yarn transactions, and the premium gradually dropped to 1.5 jiao. The morning opened slightly stable, and Yong Yarn was listed at 705 yuan and 735 yuan. Numbers 185, 137, 183, 160, 71, 186, and 89 were delivered immediately upon entry. Numbers 97, 2322, 188, 71, 134, and 169 were submitted in succession, rising to 725 yuan and 756 yuan. The off-market interest rate was still 3 jiao 1.5 fen and 3 jiao 6 fen. Numbers 96, 103, 24, and 155 were sold at high prices, dropping to around 720 yuan and 750 yuan. The swap premium gradually decreased, and large investors and brokers were active in immediate delivery. Numbers 157, 16, 69, 65, 35, 36, 176, and 130 were bought one after another, rising to a high price of 736 yuan for immediate delivery and 765 yuan for forward delivery. Numbers 180, 185, 103, and 197 all exited immediate delivery, and Number 22 also offered forward delivery. The afternoon closing dropped to 728 yuan and 756 yuan. Small stocks remained quiet as before, and the arbitrage price retreated to 25 yuan, with only 1.5 jiao of interest. As a result, compared to the last closing price at the end of the Lunar New Year, immediate delivery stocks Qinxing, Xinhua, Commerce, and Shangping, Zhongsi and Zhongfang slightly decreased, and Xinhuo, Huaguang, Xinguang, Jingfu, Zhongqie, Neiyi, Match, and Rongde slightly increased. Yong Yarn, Maya, Guohuo, Huian, Xinyi, and Zhabei Tongyi each rose by half a percent for forward delivery stocks. Yong Yarn rose by half a percent for forward delivery stocks, and Xinguang also rose by slightly less than half a percent. All others rose slightly. Except for public utilities stocks, which rose slightly, all off-market unlisted stocks were flat or weak.

### Arbitrage Trading

Yesterday, the silver supply was greatly excessive, with less demand, and the arbitrage price gradually decreased, with the premium dropping from 2 jiao 2 fen to 1 jiao 3 fen. A portion of the arbitrage positions were forced to move off-market, and brokers also bought white yarn on-market to move off-market. Calculating the premium, Yongmiao was the cheapest, opening at 35 yuan and closing at 25 yuan. Xinguang became more expensive, at 5 yuan to 5.5 yuan. Maya had few transactions, with a high price of 5.5 yuan. The opening and closing prices were both 5.0 yuan. Xinhuo opened at 1.6 yuan. Shanghai stocks were traded for half a day yesterday, the second day of the Spring Festival. Public utilities are about to adjust prices, and Western newspapers also mentioned a US loan of yuan, retreating from 1.65 yuan to 1.4 yuan at closing.

### Post-Holiday Stock Market Notes

The stock market opened after the Spring Festival with initial strength followed by fatigue. The foreign exchange adjustment on the 9th caused external stimulus and opened high due to excess capital. Eternal Cotton Yarn reached 700 yuan for immediate delivery and rose to 717 yuan for future delivery. Innerwear China Mud even reached the limit up, with off-market trading opening more than 30 yuan higher. After opening, numbers 97, 36, and 74 advanced to high prices of 714 yuan and 7122 yuan, but soon numbers 191, 151, 154, 76, 207, 90, 76, 31, 71, 65, 152, and 157 collectively supplied, resulting in limited trading and intermittent activity amid firecracker sounds. The price gradually decreased to lows of 697 yuan and 698 yuan before closing at 700 yuan and 702 yuan. Other stocks also declined. Off-market trading bids were close, with only a difference of about ten yuan. As a result, compared to the end of the lunar year, immediate delivery of China Mud had less trading but reached the limit up, and innerwear rose slightly after reaching the limit up. Eternal Cotton Yarn, Mayer, Lih An, National Goods, Rong Meng, Tong Yi, Match, and Yong Gong rose slightly. Xin He, Jing Fu, French, Xin Hua, and Zha Bei declined slightly. Hua Meng, Xin Guang, Xin Yi, Commerce, and China Silk remained unchanged. Future delivery stocks Qin Xing fell by half a percent, and the rest declined slightly. Off-market trading of unlisted stocks showed no activity for number 19, indicating a flat trend.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks

Still on holiday, with no gatherings yet.

Trading yesterday was extremely low. Except for a few popular stocks, miscellaneous stocks were inactive. People's minds were stimulated by external factors. Jardine Matheson opened high at 620,000 yuan and rose to close at 650,000 yuan, showing a much better performance than A stocks. As a result, compared to before the holiday closure, Jardine Matheson rose by half, British American Tobacco rose by 10%, and Jardine Brewery, Paper Edition Industry, and Guangzhou Shipyard each rose by half a percent. Hode Malleable Industries only rose slightly.

### Business Houses on Holiday, Capital Fund Greatly Eased

The office is preparing a report, which approved more than 100 cases, with a total acquisition amount of more than 140 billion. Most of the funds have been released by various bank bureaus. The acquisition procedures were completed on the 9th. This acquisition had a relief nature because some materials were not needed by the government and were not easy to sell at auction. The General Office of the Four Banks will have separate regulations for the auction method, which will be handled by the China Trust Bureau. The timing of the auction has not yet been determined.

### Sales of Political and Legal Materials, A New Organization Will Be Established

An organization will be formed in the short term to uniformly handle the sale of materials. The selection of personnel and the establishment date have not yet been determined.

### US Dollar Exchange Rate Rises During Holiday, Off-Market Cotton Yarn Market Strengthens

### North China Material Export Problem, Export Promotion Office Plans to Find a Thorough Solution

Shen Zhong, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Office of the Import Control Committee, were recently ordered to go to Beijing and Tianjin to resolve the difficulties of industry and commerce in North China. They returned to Shanghai after completing their work on the 8th. According to Mr. Chen Junren, who told reporters: This time, Director Shen and I went to North China to solve the problem of how industry and commerce in Beijing and Tianjin can survive the New Year. The acquisition of finished products by manufacturers is handled according to the methods approved by the General Office of the Four Banks and has a relief nature. However, the situation of export materials is different. Simply acquiring them cannot solve the export problem. The export industry in Tianjin has foresight and specially convened a meeting to suggest four points to the government: to find a thorough solution, (1) extend the settlement time, (2) handle export material mortgages, and export materials can be used as collateral for loans, (3) handle export material financing, including financing from the place of production to the export port, and export packing loans, (4) extend the time for consignment export materials. The above four points are their important suggestions. In fact, the committee has a comprehensive plan for this, and some of it has been implemented separately. Recently, it was not held due to the suspension of loans. There is no problem with the first three items, and the fourth item needs to be considered. In Beijing, most of the exportable materials are industrial products, such as embroidery and lacquerware, which were once popular abroad. Now, other methods will be set up and are planned to be handled in three aspects: (1) credit, (2) mortgage, (3) acquisition. It has been decided to lend 300 million yuan first to survive the New Year. In the future, a way out should be found first, the foreign market should be determined, and then a cooperative should be organized to include these scattered handicrafts into the cooperative as the object of handling, which will be promoted separately within six months.

### Measures for Handling Wool, One Type of Goods Arriving in Port with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, Five Principles Approved by Executive Yuan Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Import and Export Management Committee announced the handling measures for goods arriving in port with unlicensed self-provided foreign exchange through the Central Trust Bureau, including wool, cotton, and other items. Among them, the 60-day deadline for wool, from the date the Central Trust Bureau announced the wool handling measures, expired on February 9. According to law, if importers are unwilling to apply for government acquisition, they must re-export the goods. Although most manufacturers have applied for acquisition according to procedures, there are still a few importers who neither apply for acquisition nor re-export. Five principles for handling the situation were formulated and submitted to the Executive Yuan's meeting on the 11th for revision and approval. The principles are recorded as follows:

(1) Strictly implement the government's established policy without change. (2) Re-export of wool is absolutely not allowed after the 60-day deadline.

### Talking About Colds and Coughs

— Hu Jiayan

This winter seems to be much colder than in previous years, so there are many people with colds and coughs, which really causes a lot of trouble. In fact, colds and coughs are a common disease that everyone knows, and in the decades of life, almost no one can avoid it. It can mostly heal itself, as long as you take care of yourself, and there is no need to see a doctor or take medicine. This common sense is also understood by the general public. Its occurrence is mostly at times when the climate suddenly changes to cold, so it is easiest to spread from hot to autumn cool, and from warm to severe cold; especially in the climate of the last month, which has dropped to below freezing several times, so there are especially many people with it. Regarding the true nature of this disease, how to avoid its occurrence, and how to prevent it from becoming a major problem if it does occur, I would like to reveal it in this publication, and I think it will be of some benefit to the general public, whether they are already suffering from it or not!

What is a cold and cough? This is a well-known term to everyone in the vernacular, not a specialized medical term. Cough can be considered a symptom, but the term "cold" is not even close. Originally, medical terms are based on the cause of their occurrence or the pathological changes in any part of the body; according to this point, the so-called cold and cough, in medicine, such as (1) acute rhinitis (nasal cold), (2) acute laryngitis, (3) acute bronchitis, are all possible. Although these three are individually a symptom, their relationship is interactive, because laryngitis and bronchitis are mostly caused by the spread of rhinitis. Regarding their general situation, I will now describe them one by one below.

The onset of rhinitis is mostly in the pharynx, initially feeling hot and dry, with slight difficulty swallowing, and gradually entering the nasal cavity from the pharynx, down to the larynx and trachea. When it invades the nasal cavity, there are frequent sneezes, the mucous membrane is red and swollen, the nasal passages are narrowed, and even some are blocked, causing obstacles to breathing and pronunciation; the secretion of the mucous membrane is abundant, with runny nose, initially as thin as water, and then thick and yellow, becoming mucous purulent; the sense of smell and taste are impaired, and occasionally there is a headache and a slight increase in temperature. — This phenomenon generally subsides within a few days, except for cases of complications such as paranasal sinusitis, otitis media, and bronchitis.

Those suffering from laryngitis will have an itchy and stinging sensation in the neck and throat, coughing and hoarseness, and finally almost becoming mute, mostly dry cough without phlegm, occasionally with mucous. The mucous membrane is swollen and red, but it can only be detected with a laryngoscope. The larynx of children is narrower than that of adults, so it often presents a severe state, waking up in shock at night, having difficulty breathing, with wheezing, a loud cough, and a pale face, which is called pseudo-diphtheria; but if warm steam is inhaled, the symptoms will quickly alleviate, and they will snore and sleep soundly, as quiet as ever. — This disease usually subsides in about three or four days to one or two weeks, and as the cough decreases, the other symptoms also gradually subside.

The occurrence of bronchitis mostly starts in the pharynx and nasal cold, gradually spreading from the pharynx to the trachea, and down to the left and right bronchial tubes, so it is not limited to the bronchial tubes; in severe cases, it invades the small bronchioles and capillary bronchioles, which is called capillary bronchitis. Among the symptoms, cough is the main one. At the beginning, it is a stubborn dry cough, with slight pain when coughing, and gradually getting transparent, colorless mucous sputum. After two or three days, the cough feels easier, and the sputum is gradually easier to cough up, and the sputum is yellow and purulent; the body temperature generally does not change much, or there may be a slight fever at the beginning, and then it subsides. If the inflammation invades the capillary bronchioles, there will be difficulty breathing and an accelerated pulse, especially in children, and it is not without danger. — The prognosis of this disease is still good, and it generally subsides in one to two weeks; however, children are prone to developing bronchopneumonia, and the elderly are prone to heart failure, falling into critical condition, which is an exception.

The causes of the above diseases are mostly after a cold. In addition, the inhalation of dirty dust and irritating gases, and mechanical and chemical stimulation, are all easy to cause. It is contagious, and often when one person suffers from it, family members and companions develop it one after another; the pathogen has not been determined, but mostly Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, and influenza bacilli are all part of a mixed infection. Those with hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates and tonsils are also predisposing factors for this disease. Acute infectious diseases such as measles, pertussis, and influenza can all be complicated by this disease, which is called secondary. Tuberculosis patients with this disease make the condition worse, and it is especially important to prevent it.

Regarding the treatment of this disease, because it can mostly heal itself, there is not much help from medications, so attention to prevention is more important than treatment; such as quitting smoking and drinking, avoiding talking too much, avoiding spicy foods, and avoiding the inhalation of dirty air and harmful gases. In addition, in the personal and family life of the general public, there are several habits that I think need to be corrected; I will now describe them separately below to conclude this article.

(1) Minimize mouth breathing. Usually, breathing through the nose can moisten dry air and warm cold air, and the bacteria and dust in the air are retained in the uneven mucous membrane of the nasal cavity, so that the inhaled air is clean and non-toxic, and does not cause harm to the lungs. But people do not pay attention to this; especially when the weather is suddenly cold and windy, friends gather in the streets, talking and laughing without restraint, resulting in breathing through the mouth, the nasal defense function is completely abolished, leading to the formation of the above-mentioned nasal cold and bronchitis, which must be reviewed. If it is not easy to correct the habit for a while, a mask can be used to reduce the risk.

(2) Infants must sleep separately. In Chinese families, it is customary for infants to sleep in the same bed with their mothers, which is due to extreme care and the convenience of breastfeeding at night; in fact, the pollution of the air inside the quilt is undoubtedly unsuitable for infants. As a result, those who are not sick are prone to sickness, and those who are already sick are prone to complications, leading to prolonged difficulty in recovery, which is not worth it.

(3) Children must develop the habit of breathing fresh air. In many families, parents often forbid their children to play outdoors, and infants stay in small rooms all day long, with windows tightly closed, and even rarely exposed to sunlight, the purpose of which is to avoid the wind. In fact, the air outdoors is always fresher than indoors. As a result, their resistance becomes weaker, and when they go outdoors, they are far more likely to catch a cold than other children.

(4) Prevention in severe winter. In urban areas, many have cold protection equipment; this equipment varies in sophistication and is managed by individuals, each different. If you go from a place with no equipment to a place with temperature regulation, going back and forth every day, it is also easy to catch a cold; therefore, it should be minimized as much as possible within the scope of possibility.

When the nasal mucosa is inflamed and the secretions are abundant, and the nose is runny, people often squeeze the nose with two fingers to expel the mucus; as a result, part of the secretion is often sucked in, which is easy to cause paranasal sinusitis. If you only use one finger to hold one side of the nose, you can avoid this drawback.

### Editor's Note

Many readers write to ask about the treatment of various diseases and hope that we will publish the answers in this newspaper. This is what we should do and are happy to do. But in fact, there are many troubles that make us unable to do so. For example, time does not allow us to do so, because we all have our own professions. In addition to reluctantly reporting some new medical and new Chinese knowledge in this publication, where is there time to answer readers? Moreover, there are great drawbacks to asking about diseases and prescribing medicine by mail. Previously, various newspapers also had very severe criticisms. Therefore, except in certain circumstances where we give appropriate instructions, we are unwilling to write them out and publish them in this publication, so as not to increase unexpected troubles. I hope that readers can forgive this difficulty! However, we must state that if readers attach an address and postage, then we always hope to take the time to answer directly.

Many people write to inquire about the efficacy of rheumatism and where to buy it, which shows that this disease must be very common. Unfortunately, this medicine is not yet sold in Shanghai. However, the synthesis of this medicine is not very difficult, and at present, there are bacteriology experts who are studying and manufacturing it, and we will report again if there are results.

Some people write to criticize the excessive medical advertisements in this publication and ask whether it is related to the Shanghai Medical Association and this publication. In fact, this association is only responsible for the manuscripts of this publication, and all advertisements are unrelated to the editorial board of this publication. Please pay attention to readers!

### Spray Therapy in the History of Traditional Chinese Medicine

— Yang Wenyu

Last month, on the 7th, the Shen Kang newspaper published a news article about using spray therapy to treat asthma. It mentioned that hospitals in Shanghai have specially equipped devices for patients to use. This is a type of Western medicine treatment adopted by traditional Chinese medicine hospitals in Shanghai. However, I have also seen records in ancient Chinese history of famous doctors using this method to treat diseases. For example, in the "Biography of Xu Yinzhong" in the Book of Sui, Volume 191, there is the following passage:

"Xu Yinzhong was from Changzhou Yixing. He initially served in the Chen dynasty as a military advisor to the King of Jian'an. At that time, Empress Liu suffered from wind disease and could not speak. Famous doctors treated her without success, and her pulse became increasingly deep and she remained silent. Yinzhong said, 'Medicine cannot be administered through the mouth, it is better to fumigate her with medicinal vapor, allowing it to enter the acupoints. When the circulation is restored, she will recover.' He then prepared dozens of shi (a unit of dry volume) of Astragalus and Saposhnikovia Decoction and placed it under the bed, creating a vapor like smoke. That night, she was able to speak. As a result, he was promoted to Prefect of Yixing. After the fall of Chen, he entered the Sui dynasty and successively served as Attendant of the Imperial Pharmacy. In the early years of the Wude era of the Tang dynasty, bone steaming disease was prevalent in Guanzhong, and those who contracted it were sure to die, spreading from person to person. No doctor was able to cure it, but Yinzhong cured every patient he treated.'" (Omitted below) The "Biographies of Fangji" in the New Book of Tang also records this matter, attached to the biography of Zhen Quan, with similar content, so I will not repeat it. The diseases treated and the treatment methods described there are different from those mentioned in the newspaper, and it does not mention the use of any devices. However, it is clearly a form of spray therapy, which is undoubtedly true. Today's Western medicine spray therapy may have evolved from old Chinese medicine methods. However, the Chinese have never been very interested in medical research, and many secret formulas are passed down privately, refusing to be made public, leading to their loss. Even the widely known "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic" and "Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic" have mostly been distorted in transmission and placed on high shelves. Over thousands of years, there have been no new medical inventions or medicines. Even this type of vapor therapy, which appears twice in official historical biographies, is hardly known by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. By analogy, countless effective medical prescriptions and medicines from ancient China have been lost. This is a major reason why traditional Chinese medicine cannot compete with Western medicine. I was moved by reading the newspaper and wrote this brief discussion, hoping that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners across the country will not "forget their ancestors" but quickly search through historical records and local chronicles for famous doctors and their effective prescriptions, compile them into medical books for research, and then combine them with Western medicine's scientific experiments to ensure practical application. This would not only preserve national essence but also benefit the health and well-being of the people. I dare to ask contemporary medical experts for their opinions.

: The above article is a submission from an outside source. Our newspaper's aim is to promote the development of medicine, which is blameless. In reality, there is no distinction between Chinese and Western medicine, only between new and old. During the Han and Tang dynasties, countless Western treatment methods were introduced from the Western Regions and have now become part of the national essence of Chinese medicine. In recent decades, many Chinese medicinal materials have been adopted by European and American countries. This shows that there is no conflict between Chinese and Western medicine, and they can indeed complement each other. In recent years, medicines like Xiaozhi Long tablets and diphtheria antitoxin have even been adopted by some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. This further proves that "there is no such thing as Chinese or Western medicine, only new and old" is true. Today, science is all-powerful and not satisfied with just the atomic bomb. If one stubbornly clings to old-fashioned gunpowder weapons (note that gunpowder was invented in China), then it is inevitable that one will be dominated and destroyed by others.

Mr. Yang's article also strongly encourages traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to "quickly search through historical records and local chronicles for famous doctors and their effective prescriptions, compile them into medical books for research, and then combine them with Western medicine's scientific experiments to ensure practical application. This would not only preserve national essence but also benefit the health and well-being of the people." In fact, not only should traditional Chinese medicine adapt to the times and absorb new medical knowledge (people during the Han and Tang dynasties were even able to absorb Western Region medicine and turn it into national essence, why should we cling to outdated practices today?), but also modern Western medicine should continue to research and avoid being arrogant and thinking that simply putting up a Western medicine sign means having omnipotent skills. Today, medical science is advancing rapidly, and in a blink of an eye, yesterday's knowledge becomes outdated and is eliminated. Only those who adapt to the times and continue to improve can maintain an unshakable position.

### A New Method for Quitting Alcohol

— Liang Junqing

I have previously introduced methods for relieving drunkenness in this publication, but some people think they are not thorough enough, believing that instead of seeking solutions after getting drunk, why not simply quit the habit altogether? In reality, occasional drunkenness is not harmful. Therefore, seeking solutions after getting drunk is still indispensable. However, alcohol can cloud one's judgment and harm the body. If one can naturally quit the habit, the significance would be more than just extending life! Therefore, I have written this article specifically to inform readers.

According to a report by Mr. Skala in America, he has used the Thiman method (Method nach J. Thiman) to help people quit alcohol with great success, which is worth introducing. Here is an excerpt translated below:

In the morning on an empty stomach, inject Strychnine 1mg subcutaneously into the person trying to quit alcohol. At the same time, administer a Benzedrine or Percitin tablet of 5-10mg. Two hours later, orally administer 0.07 of Emtin. After about 15 to 20 minutes, take the patient to a dimly lit, well-equipped room with beverages on display. At this time, inject a mixed preparation subcutaneously. The mixed preparation consists of Ipecac Emeti 0.05, a miotic and sudorific agent Piocarpin 0.012-0.024, and Ephedrine 0.02-0.06, which has three meanings: inducing vomiting, promoting sweating, and promoting blood circulation throughout the body. A small dose of this injectable should be used initially, and the dosage can be gradually increased depending on the situation. After injecting this mixture, have the person trying to quit alcohol select the best liquor, about 30 grams, and pour it into a small glass. Have the person carefully observe the color of the liquor, smell its aroma, and then taste it and drink it all. After several minutes, have the person drink a second 30 grams of good liquor in the same situation. At this time, the person will feel dizzy and nauseous. Then vomiting will occur. After each time they drink liquor, there will be two or three times of vomiting, completely expelling the liquor. Finally, have the person drink 100 cc of beer mixed with 0.015 of Kalium stiotaricum, so that the feeling of nausea while drinking can be maintained for a long time. This method of quitting alcohol is absolutely safe and reliable. However, if the person's pulse accelerates to 140 beats per minute, it must be stopped immediately.

Typically, after using the above method four to eight times, it will subconsciously form an association between drinking and nausea and vomiting. This association can make the person abhor the sight of alcohol, feel nauseous smelling alcohol, vomit when drinking alcohol, and even feel upset when thinking about alcohol. It is truly a wonderful method. However, it should be noted that the vomiting procedure after the injection should last between 20 and 35 minutes each time, and should not exceed 35 minutes to avoid affecting the heart. Also, when the person is about to drink the 30 grams of good liquor, it is best to choose high-quality liquor (such as old brandy or whiskey) at first. Then gradually switch to beer or wine. During the period of quitting alcohol, it is absolutely inappropriate to use anesthetics or sedatives. If quitting alcohol has been successful, the above method should be continued three times at intervals of two months, four months, and eight months, so that the association of aversion to alcohol can exist forever, then the person can quit alcohol completely. Although this method may cause temporary discomfort to the person, it is only temporary (at most two months), because it does not take as long as the old method, which takes at least six months.

Occasionally, bladder spasms, urinary urgency, and bowel urgency may occur when quitting alcohol, but they will disappear soon and there is no need to worry. If the person trying to quit alcohol has heart disease, inguinal hernia, stomach ulcers, tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, or acute mental illness, this method must not be used to avoid danger. (Please refer to Prakticky lekar, Volume 15, 1947).

### "The New Year is Coming"

— Li Zhenping

Books about local customs are very interesting, especially those about places where one has lived for a long time. They can reveal the lives of early settlers and the origins of certain changes. It is like a child breaking a clay pot to get to the bottom of things, which is a satisfying release of the desire for knowledge. During this time of year, it can be especially enjoyable to read them as one would feast on a roast pig, even if one cannot get the meat, it is still satisfying.

Recently, I saw a news report that the Ministry of Education has allocated 1 billion yuan to Peking University to purchase old books, otherwise they will all be sold to paper mills and turned into recycled paper. This news is no less shocking than the Kowloon incident. Some time ago, several speakers from the north came south to petition, saying that 500,000 yuan worth of flour in the south became 1 million yuan in Beiping, because of the 500,000 yuan per bag permit fee. Recently, it has been proven that this was done by Shanghai merchants and has nothing to do with the government. We will not concern ourselves with the specifics of these events, but the disasters that the ancient city in the snowy landscape has suffered have already surfaced in our minds. Inside and outside the city, there are refugees everywhere. At the end of the year, the price of flour will probably rise to 1.5 million yuan, right? Even Beijing and Shanghai have already exceeded 700,000 or 800,000! I myself was born in the north and know its history somewhat, so I naturally feel more sorrow and indignation about these cold facts than the average person.

Beiping is stubborn about old customs. Because it is Beiping, it is Beiping, the remnant of a 700-year-old imperial capital. We have only love and nostalgia for these old customs, and we never find them unreasonable. Even on the second day of the Lunar New Year, getting up early to rush to the Temple of the God of Wealth outside Zhangyi Gate to borrow two paper ingots and insert two red velvet flowers, we do not find it unpleasant. A nation has its own traditions, and a place has its own local color. We should never shallowly criticize them with materialism. The United States is such an advanced and scientific country, but in Utah, there is still the Mormon sect, Mormonism, saying that their golden Bible is secretly passed down from God, and that what others have passed down is false. How is this different from Song Jiang dreaming of the Heavenly Maiden? And St. Anne's Temple in Quebec, Canada, also has a finger bone of Saint Anne, which people worship and kiss. Isn't this just a foreign relic? The meaning is not to use foreigners to value ourselves. Santa Claus comes down the chimney, and his meaning is no different from the God of Wealth borrowing ingots. Then why can't the jumping at the Evergreen tree be changed to burning incense at midnight?

I have lived in Shanghai for two years and in Nanjing for more than a year. I do not see such a strong atmosphere of old New Year customs, except for the frantic price increases and workers' strikes. Unlike in the north, where in the eleventh lunar month, there are people selling pine and cypress branches, paper flowers, and New Year's pictures along the alleys, and children and old people all have a new mood and a new atmosphere, as the children's rhyme says: "Offer candy to the Stove God, the New Year is coming, girls want flowers, boys want cannons..." The customs recorded in Liu Tongren's "A Brief Record of the Scenery of the Imperial Capital" are quite worth reading, but unfortunately I do not have the book at hand, so I cannot copy some of it to give a taste of the whole. I only remember that it describes various folk customs in great detail from the beginning of the Lunar New Year to the end of the first month. Scholars and officials are mostly those who uphold tradition and often slander folk stories in vain. Liu Jun was able to overcome this obstacle and provide an objective account, so that even three hundred years later, it can still be verified. His contribution is by no means small, and it cannot be encompassed by ordinary literary history. Ju Nong of Xian Yuan's "Sounds of the Year" records the street food and toys at the end and beginning of the year, and is especially clear and understandable. Although his writing is not refined, he is telling the truth in a practical way, like seeing those old farmers wearing old cloth cotton-padded jackets, carrying two urns along the alleys on the first day of the Lunar New Year, calling out "Hey, spicy vegetables!" (a kind of pickled mustard tuber with a spicy taste, very fresh, eaten specifically before the fifth day of the Lunar New Year). As soon as they see you walking out early in the morning, they will first say "Congratulations on getting rich" to you, which, in addition to its simplicity, also has a kind of indescribable politeness. Its loveliness is no less than that of cultural relics such as the Forbidden City and Longevity Hill that are scheduled to be renovated. To be honest, I think it does not matter at all if Beiping loses its status as a capital city or if Duan Gate and Meridian Gate are in disrepair. Losing that warm human touch is the greatest loss. But with "foreign flour" costing 1.5 million yuan a bag, how can human feelings not change? According to the old rules, from New Year's Eve to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, we must eat "boiled dumplings," which are dumplings made with the best flour and pork! Even cornbread needs to be budgeted for, so what else is there to talk about? When I was in Beiping, at first, the beggars who "delivered the God of Wealth" to each house usually started in the evening, but later it was no longer possible. People would deliver them in broad daylight, calling out "The God of Wealth is here!" across the door. If you did not accept them, they would say some nonsense, so-called "scolding and scolding." If you did accept them, it would be endlessly annoying. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, these people came to bother people in the alley just after lunch. At that time, we only sighed that the price of foreign flour had risen from three yuan to seven yuan. What about now? Perhaps it is even more frugal. With paper so expensive, even the God of Wealth is avoiding it, right?

Dim years, dim mood, and yet encountering this holiday that cannot be avoided!

### A Word Worth Ten Thousand Gold

— Jinjin

Several years ago, I read a complaint from an author in a certain publication, who deeply lamented the low rates of pay for contributions at the time. Therefore, he put forward the slogan "a word worth a thousand gold," although it was an unrealistic fantasy, it was still better than nothing. The "thousand gold" at that time was naturally incomparable to the "thousand gold" now, and the "gold" he spoke of was actually a euphemism for "yuan." However, even the thousand yuan at that time was quite a considerable amount.

In these times, the saying "a word worth a thousand gold" seems to be approaching its realization. Contribution fees above a certain standard seem to be generally calculated at at least one hundred gold (yuan) per word. Furthermore, if we use the most grassroots monetary unit—pancakes and fried dough sticks—for calculation, the current price of one serving of pancakes and fried dough sticks, compared with before the war, is a ratio of 4,000 yuan to 0.02 yuan, which is a full 200,000-fold increase. Then, calculating contribution fees at one thousand gold per word is equivalent to a million gold per thousand words. The number sounds a bit frightening, but in reality, it is not equivalent to five yuan per thousand words before the war. At that time, it was very common for first-class writers to earn ten yuan per thousand words. This also reflects the drastic fluctuations in the value of our country's currency, which has almost fallen sharply.

Generally speaking, when authors rack their brains and temporarily have no subject matter to write about, or when they have to deal with some "mundane matters" such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, they cannot help but write about the contribution fees that they have a "visceral connection" with. This column has previously published an article about contribution fees (it seems that writing this kind of article always involves some lamentations). The author feels that his ideas are not yet fully expressed, so he will continue to add a few words here.

I often feel that the meager income of cultural people is not the fault of the cultural people themselves, but is due to the inherent inadequacy of the objective environment.

Speaking of the inherent inadequacy of the cultural industry environment, the biggest problem is that education in our country has not been universal, and most people cannot be as addicted to books and newspapers as their lives. Originally, the cultural industry could depend on industry and commerce for its survival. The more developed industry and commerce are, the more attention is paid to the effectiveness of book and newspaper advertising, which can indirectly provide strong support for the various books, newspapers, and magazines that publish advertisements. Take the United States as an example. Although the cultural industry may be a noble undertaking, the atmosphere of commerce is very strong. Several popular writers hire Press Agents to take full responsibility for publicizing them. Also, when a new book is published, the publishers take the lead in publishing full-page advertisements in newspapers such as the New York Times Book Review, listing the author's photo and various favorable comments. The situation is as lively as the fanfare for a new stage star.

Moreover, American writers seem to have more ways to make money than our fellow ink enthusiasts. In addition to contribution fees, they can also charge for writing short stories and novels, selling the right to reprint in various newspapers, the right to broadcast on the radio, and the right to adapt into movie scripts. In their free time, they can also give speeches in various places, sell tickets for listening to lectures, or attend parties hosted by celebrities and wealthy households, and be the honored guests at the party, truly earning both fame and wealth, no less than the most ideal occupation.

Therefore, since American writers have so many ways to make money, the price of a word is naturally considerable. For example, Damon Runyon, who is known as the modern O. Henry and a master of Broadway, can buy a new car for every thousand words he writes. This is much more valuable than the "a word worth a thousand gold" that our country's authors dreamed of for many years. At the end of this article, I cannot help but shout out the slogan "a word worth ten thousand gold (yuan)," which can also be regarded as a slight expression of good wishes and prayers for professional writers in the sound of the Spring Festival. If the objective situation and conditions do not change, perhaps there will be a day when it is realized next year, although no one dares to say whether ten thousand yuan at that time will be able to buy a stamp, an egg, or a fraction of a box of matches.

### It's Hard to Buy Books

— Mang

There was an article in this publication about "It's Hard to Write Books." Not only is it hard to write books, but now it is also hard to buy books. It's not that you can't afford to buy them, but you can't find them, which really makes people feel like it's "hard."

Buying books is indeed a difficult task at present. The first thing that makes book buyers feel difficult is "can't afford it." The prices are too expensive, and most people do not have the ability to buy them. At present, the purchasing power of most people is very weak, and they cannot afford to buy ordinary daily necessities, let alone books that are considered unimportant? Moreover, book prices are too high, and even people with some purchasing power cannot afford it because they think book prices are too "expensive."

However, bookstore owners also have their reasons. They say: The price of paper is too expensive, and the cost of typesetting and printing is high, so the selling price cannot but be increased, otherwise they will lose money. This is a very sufficient reason. People who open bookstores also have capital, so can you ask him to lower the selling price?

The second difficulty people feel is "can't find it." Some people will say this: Aren't there so many books placed in bookstores, just go and buy them, who says you can't buy books? Bookstores are indeed full of books, but how many of them meet the standards and requirements? As long as you go to bookstores to take a look, most of the bookstores sell erotic novels and the like, and truly academic monographs can be said to be very few. Therefore, the second difficulty that book buyers feel is that they cannot buy the books they need. Even if there are any, they are difficult to meet their ideals, and book buyers have to spend some effort to choose. When people mention selection, they feel very difficult.

The last difficulty in buying books is which bookstore to go to buy from. Each store has its own views. Some hope to sell more at a lower profit, while others hope to sell less at a higher profit. Book buyers must first understand the style of the bookstore. Moreover, some bookstore clerks are friendly to people, while some bookstore clerks are not polite to people at all. Of course, we have to go to the former type of store. Since we are spending money to buy books, why should we suffer other people's ill temper? This is something that no one can tolerate, right? Sometimes, if you stand in a bookstore for a moment, the clerk will give you a "displeased look," saying that you are hindering their business. This situation is really embarrassing, but people who don't understand will be subjected to this treatment, which is also a "difficulty" for book buyers.

In short, everything is a "difficulty" for book buyers. If we want to solve this difficulty, we can only have readers and publishers closely linked and work together, and then there will be hope for solving these difficulties.

Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (68)

When Jingru saw that she spoke so sincerely and felt so earnestly, she was extremely moved. She could not help but pat Qiyun on the shoulder again and say, "You are too good! You yourself are willing to sacrifice, but my heart cannot bear it, and furthermore, Zhuji loves you deeply. You cannot reject him either. He has suffered a major stimulus, and something unexpected could happen, then my old age would be even more miserable!" Qiyun hesitated for a long time and said, "This is not a problem. I also admit that Zhuji does love me, he loves me sincerely, and that is what I admire about him. I have my own way of dealing with him. I don't need to reject him, I can make him hate me himself, and he will reject me himself. At that time, I will separate naturally without breaking up. But people who don't understand my way of doing things will definitely heap many harsh and contemptible criticisms on me. At that time, you, old sir, will hear them. You, old sir, know my difficulties, perhaps you can forgive me..." As Qiyun spoke, her face turned pale, tears filled her eyes, and she sobbed and could not speak, and she cried again. Yuru nodded and said, "Miss Gu, you are so kind to take care of my family, how can I repay you." Qiyun said, "No! It is because of this cause that there is this effect. I should not have become enamored with Zhuqi in the first place. Zhu has been married before, but once I am in love, it cannot be erased for a lifetime. I can only take this heart with me to the grave." As she spoke, she cried again. Yuru knew that her heart was struggling between reason and desire, and she was extremely sad, so she said, "Miss Gu, you are too kind. It is all because of my presumptuous visit today that you have suffered this major stimulus! You should calm down, and this matter may be carefully considered." Qiyun said, "I have already decided to do this, there is no need to consider it. While my reason is clear at this time, I can still choose a path to take, so as not to harm others. If I wait until my reason is submerged and my mind is completely surrounded by love and selfishness, then I will not be able to get rid of it, and perhaps I will do things that benefit myself and harm others. I only hope that you, old sir, will forgive me. Although I am in the pear garden circle, my family background is different from ordinary people. I value my reputation the most. I never want to do anything that would lead to bad criticism. I have decided everything, I want to protect my own reputation, and I want to protect Zhuqi's whole family. This is how I respect myself and repay you, old sir, for your teaching. Now that I have said it in front of you, old sir, I will follow my plan and go step by step. You, old sir, please rest assured. And I hope you will go back and tell the old lady that I, surnamed Gu, will not come to her house!"

### On Civilized Nations

— Yanru

A few days ago, someone added a definition to "civilized nation" in the newspaper: "A civilized nation is one that necessarily allows the existence of opposing elements or groups within its borders." It was also said: "A country where the opposition slams the table and vehemently scolds in parliament, and even holds demonstrations, must be a vibrant country." This so-called civilization and vibrancy presumably refer to the United Kingdom and the United States. It is a pity that the current United States (I am not clear about the United Kingdom) has already gone from vibrancy to decline.

According to American history books, about ninety years ago, a senator named Sumner in that country vehemently scolded Senator Butler from South Carolina (whether he slammed the table is unknown), which enraged Brooks, a fellow senator from South Carolina and either a relative or friend of Butler. Brooks picked up a very thick cane and struck Sumner on the head, knocking him unconscious. Although it was unexpected and caught the opponent off guard, lacking chivalry, the people of South Carolina admired it greatly. In addition to treating Brooks to a grand feast, they also presented him with a new cane inscribed with exquisite words, saying: "Used to knock down those with glib tongues." The House of Representatives at that time was even more vibrant, and the attending members had to carry guns and knives to guard against any eventuality. In order to prevent a major conflict, two members from Pennsylvania and North Carolina were even placed under imprisonment, probably because these two gentlemen were prone to drawing their guns at the slightest disagreement. Such vibrancy became increasingly pronounced, eventually erupting into the Civil War, with countless deaths and immense financial cost. Now, from a peak to decline, it has reached the point of slamming tables and vehemently scolding, although it is still admired by our country's journalists, Americans probably feel that things are not as good as they used to be.

Based on this, when discussing the civilization and barbarity, vibrancy and decline of various countries in the world today, the United Kingdom and the United States should be considered the most civilized and vibrant, while the Soviet Union is the most barbaric and declining. The Soviet Union absolutely does not allow the existence of opposing elements or groups within its borders, and there is absolutely no opposition in the Supreme Soviet or the lowest Soviet to slam the table and vehemently scold, let alone hold demonstrations. However, this definition of a civilized nation and the notion of vibrancy are highly problematic. I do not understand why allowing opposing elements or groups within a country makes it a civilized nation. If the rulers often order the people to fast for half a month from a certain date without allowing opposing elements or groups to slam the table and vehemently scold, or even hold demonstrations, it is indeed uncivilized and lacks vitality. But if the rulers are always mindful of the people's hunger and cold, constantly checking if the people's bellies are full and if their hands are cold, providing food when they are hungry and gloves when they are cold, is it still necessary to hire some opposing elements or groups to slam the table, vehemently scold, and hold demonstrations before it can be considered truly civilized and have a vibrant atmosphere?

Frankly speaking, writing articles is easy, but giving definitions is very difficult, so I will not give this definition: A sycophant is a thief of virtue.

### Progress

— Fangji

A propagandist stood on the podium and enthusiastically said: "Moscow's economic construction has progressed much more than before. The twenty-story building standing on Marx Street is one example." An enthusiastic listener immediately stood up to correct his mistake, saying: "I walk on Marx Street every day, and I haven't seen a twenty-story building!" The propagandist immediately retorted: "You are really too stupid. Why do you waste your time walking on the street? Can't you read the news about national construction in the newspaper?"

### Food and Housing in Old Beijing

High prices and the difficulty of living are a common lament everywhere, even if expressed in a single word. Among the four essential elements of "clothing, food, housing, and transportation," the "housing" aspect seems easier to solve in old Beijing than in Shanghai and Hankou. This is partly because of the wide-open space, with the inner and outer cities stretching over forty miles, and families of all sizes having their own courtyards and gardens, rarely with "houses on top of houses," often giving visitors from other places the impression of a garden. It is also because, since the government moved south, Beijing has long lost its political center and is not a trading port, with government offices no longer comparable to the former ministries and departments in Beijing. Travelers seeking fame and fortune no longer "flock from all over the country." Therefore, the ratio of population to land area is naturally not too high. In general, the housing shortage in Beijing is not so severe that people have to "pile on" or "scramble" to live in the same place.

However, the fact that this ancient city can still maintain the appearance of a considerable metropolis is largely due to the large number of academics. After all, it is a "cultural city" and the location of the highest institutions of learning. Several universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, and various private colleges, have a long history and a large scale, attracting scholars from all over the country who travel thousands of miles to study. In the political circles, from the central government agencies to the local government agencies, there are also all kinds of positions. As for the business and industrial sectors, the book and antique businesses are mostly run by people from Hebei (south of Baoding, to Jizhou, Nangong, etc.); the exchange houses, paint shops, and dried fruit shops are mostly run by people from Shanxi; the silk and satin businesses, restaurants, meat shops, grain shops, and coolies are mostly run by people from Shandong. These are the three major components of Beijing's market. Because of transportation obstacles, their hometown houses and fields have been "liquidated," leaving them homeless and stranded in the ancient city. Their fellow villagers and children flock to Beijing to avoid "struggle" or conscription, thus creating a situation where the true desolation of the countryside and the false prosperity of the city are mutually dependent.

Among the three aspects of housing—buying and selling, mortgaging, and renting—the most troublesome is mortgaging. Ten years ago, one or two thousand yuan could mortgage a small courtyard house. If the original contract stipulated that it could be redeemed at the original price after ten years, then today's one or two thousand yuan cannot even buy half a steamed bun. Even two or three years ago, those who borrowed cash by mortgaging their house deeds or other items now want to redeem them at the original price, but the currency value has changed greatly. As a result, disputes arise, with each party sticking to its own version of the story, which is often seen in newspapers, causing readers to smile wryly.

The matter of renting simple houses has already led to many strange dramas since the period of occupation, due to the inflation of counterfeit currency. Landlords do not collect rent, and tenants deposit the rent in banks or post offices, publishing notices in newspapers stating that they are not responsible for owing rent, which has added many deposits to banks, while newspapers have increased a large amount of advertising revenue, reaping the benefits of both sides. The two sides argue over the value of the currency, calculating the past and present, leaving onlookers unable to judge who is right or wrong, and only able to recognize it as a tragicomedy caused by economic changes of the times.

However, recently, the practice of using "flour" as the standard for rent has become a very common and open fact. In important areas, some people demand one or two bags per room per month, while even small houses with fewer than ten rooms in remote areas require this amount. As a result, the slogan of "one bag of flour, one house, one month" or the "Three Ones Doctrine" is the most popular. With the price of flour averaging one million yuan per bag according to the market price of previous years, a family living in a small house would have to bear a staggering amount of legal tender for rent alone. However, using flour as a standard can save the trouble of re-evaluating the currency value every month. Although tenants feel oppressed by the excessive price, they also find it convenient because there is a standard to avoid haggling.

Although landlords seem to be in a high-pressure situation of owning property, they also complain endlessly. Because renting out a house, regardless of its size, does not necessarily mean getting just one bag of flour according to the usual practice. Now, they have no choice but to ask for one bag of flour and are still scolded. And with the repeated increases in tenants who do not pay rent or who sublet fraudulently, and with the government adjusting land prices and imposing house taxes everywhere, those who say that owning property is enjoyable may be unaware of "one family's troubles."

Because rent is based on "flour," the problem of "housing" still needs to be solved by "food." It can be seen that among the four essential elements of life, "food" is still the most important. "The country takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven" is a statement that cannot be refuted. The order of "clothing, food, and housing" is a natural habit of the sound and tone of the words, not that "food" is ranked after "clothing." This can be proven by the fact that "hunger" and "satisfaction" are above "cold" and "warm" in the phrases "hunger and cold" and "satisfaction and warmth."

The North uses flour as the standard because most northerners are accustomed to eating flour, and flour bags are relatively easy to count. In the South, which is not accustomed to flour, should it be based on "rice"? Should it be discussed in terms of "packages," "pounds," "pecks," or "rooms"? Should it be a building? Or should we not use real objects at all?

Editor's note: The other day, I returned late at night and chatted with a rickshaw puller, who told me that villagers are flocking to Shanghai like a tide, overjoyed to have a place to shelter from the wind and rain. As a result, the business of building straw sheds for rent in the suburbs is very prosperous, with each shed costing four to six pecks of rice per month.
