### On the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Thrift

Diligence and thrift have always been the traditional virtues of Chinese people for thousands of years. This virtue, rather than being due to the realization of a moral ideal, is more due to the formation of the actual environment. Since the social production system has mainly been agricultural, diligence and thrift are the keys to success in an agricultural society. Especially in recent decades, when natural disasters and man-made calamities have occurred constantly, and people's livelihoods have declined, ordinary people must be diligent and thrifty, or they will inevitably suffer from hunger, cold, and death. Therefore, as far as the general public is concerned, a diligence and thrift movement seems superfluous. Currently, those who are not diligent and thrifty are only the few wealthy and leisurely classes in the cities; they have created a wasteful atmosphere, poisoning themselves and spreading their influence to the whole country, affecting the market's cunning and the government's corruption. They are indeed the蛀虫 of Chinese society today, and the diligence and thrift movement should target this group of people. These people have reached the point of incorrigibility and cannot be influenced by empty talk about diligence and thrift. We should first explore the root causes of their lack of diligence and thrift, and then start from the root causes to carry out thorough reforms. We believe that this is a matter of social system, not just a moral ideal; the solution also lies in creating an environment in which everyone cannot but be diligent and thrifty, rather than just promoting or persuading people to regard diligence and thrift as virtues.

The wealthy are not diligent because they do not need to be diligent. They possess assets beyond the limits of what is necessary for life, and by virtue of these excessive assets, they employ the labor of others to accumulate more excessive assets, neither farming nor weaving, neither hunting nor foraging, folding their hands and waiting for success. They are a parasitic class in society, sucking the blood of others to fatten themselves. A society in which such a parasitic class can exist is bound to be hollowed out one day; there is no doubt about that. To investigate the responsibility, it lies more with society itself than with this parasitic class. Because emotion is inherent in people and all things, if society allows a person to gain without labor, it would be against human nature for him to refuse this favor. Therefore, the fundamental way to persuade them is to create a non-labor-no-gain environment, and to achieve this goal, to put everyone on an equal footing in the competition for survival, with equal opportunities, the only way is to break the current situation where one can gain without labor. There is no secret to breaking the situation where one can gain without labor; just limit the excessive accumulation of assets beyond what is necessary for life. One share of effort will yield one share of reward, and no effort will yield no reward. The economic principle of consumption should be based on income (revenue) to determine expenditure (consumption), and the economic principle of production and distribution should be based on output (labor) to determine input (reward). In this way, diligence will be rewarded, and laziness will be punished. This is the general principle of survival competition, the survival of the fittest, and human society is certainly no exception. Therefore, in our view, the current government's call for national construction through thrift is probably like many other similar slogans, thrown in the sand. If it is unwilling to come up with an effective way to drastically eradicate the capital of the wealthy and limit all assets that exceed the limits of what is necessary for life.

Under the same principle, we should establish a sound examination and appointment system. The deepest-rooted laziness currently lies with officials, from township and baojia chiefs to central government officials; the reason is that their path to promotion is not based on their own abilities and achievements, but on the power of parties and factions, as well as private scheming and running around. Since mediocrity can be promoted by chance, ability and achievement are bound to take a back seat, and the general public does not need to strive to gain ability and achievement, but only needs to do their best to flatter and follow, to secure their positions. Everyone imitates each other, and the situation gets worse and worse, leading to the current unstable situation in the officialdom. The diligence and thrift national construction movement is, of course, aimed at this situation. But this situation is deeply rooted and cannot be saved by slogans. Reform requires innovation. The current root of disaster lies in rewarding mediocrity and suppressing hard work and the merit system. Therefore, we must establish a sound examination and appointment system, conduct fair examinations, and appoint people based on their abilities. Based on the system, based on merit, determine rewards and punishments. If no one in society can be promoted by chance, no one will fail to understand the value of effort, or harbor the hope of advancing without effort.

Secondly, the reason why the wealthy are not thrifty is nothing more than two reasons: First, it is related to the above-mentioned non-labor-no-gain situation. They do not know the difficulty of earning money, and money that comes easily goes easily. People are born with some inferior desires, and if they have the means to satisfy these desires and society has no restricting power, they will satisfy them, following the natural trend. Therefore, to prevent them from being extravagant and lustful, just force them to earn the resources for life through their own efforts; when they know the difficulty of earning, they will naturally know the need for thrift. Secondly, they are not thrifty because the social distribution system does not exist or is imperfect, allowing them to have excessive and improper enjoyment. What they have is money, and money can do anything. They can buy whatever they want. Society not only does not restrict or criticize them but considers this a gratifying glory. Under tolerance and encouragement, they do not treat themselves harshly, which is also following the natural trend. Therefore, to thoroughly prevent extravagance and encourage thrift, we must establish a reasonable consumption and distribution system, such as the one currently adopted in England, strictly prohibiting the manufacture and import of luxury goods, and strictly prohibiting the unfair distribution of essential goods. If you only need to eat, not smoke or drink, then smoking and drinking are not allowed. If you only need to eat one jin of rice per day, you are not allowed to buy one jin and one liang. By doing this, everyone is equal, and you are not allowed to be thrifty, no matter how much money you have or how high your position.

In the Chinese ethical system, frugality has always been emphasized. There is no nation that does not regard diligence as a virtue, and among all nations, the Chinese people are most concerned with and encourage thrift. In fact, between the two, diligence is more important than thrift. Diligence is the key to creation and wealth, while thrift is only the conservation of enjoyment; diligence focuses on increasing income, while thrift focuses on reducing expenditure; therefore, diligence is active, while thrift is passive. Thrift is not necessarily a virtue, but we do not need to overemphasize it. Human civilization should move towards abundance and breadth of life, whether in material or spiritual aspects. One generation's extravagance becomes the next generation's necessity. Need is the driving force of civilization and a whip to human effort, a driving force of creation and production. Excessive thrift can lead to dryness of life and stagnation of civilization. Especially in China, where living standards are already extremely low, we do not need to encourage the general public to lower their living standards further. We have already tightened our belts enough; tightening them further will lead to the loss of life and vitality. What we want to promote is creation and production, the development of a source of abundance in life. We want to propose a perfect plan and establish a perfect system so that everyone can maximize their potential and exchange their own efforts for the abundance and breadth of their lives. Thrift may make up for existing disasters, but only diligence can truly build the country. Diligence also needs a place to be used. Currently, Chinese society is like a stalled machine, with many workers in the factory forced to idle, staring blankly. There is an unknown amount of wasted power and suppressed vitality in this. It is really useless to simply make a slogan now. We must remove this forced idleness and start this machine again, so that people in all departments can stand at their posts and exert their effectiveness. That is to say, the countryside must be revitalized, factories must be built, and all public welfare undertakings must be promoted.

These are all extremely simple and obvious truths. We do not need advanced theories, nor do we need to exaggerate propaganda. It is not difficult to say, but it is difficult to do; doing is not difficult, but it is difficult for those in power to start with themselves, work hard, seek truth from facts, and establish a new atmosphere.

### Incompetent Magistrate of Echeng: Treats Economic Controls as Routine, Delays Study for Over a Month

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] A certain authoritative figure here recently provided information to our reporter regarding economic controls. According to them, when they went to Echeng earlier this month, they discovered that the people of Echeng were still unaware of the economic control regulations. After repeated inquiries, it was learned that the county had received the economic control order forwarded by the commissioner's office on August 27th, but Magistrate Shi did not issue it to the various departments for "study" and implementation until September 18th. Therefore, by the end of September, the departments had not yet received this decree. Regarding this matter, someone commented: In extraordinary times, political methods can also be a powerful tool for solving economic problems. If all towns and major cities could implement controls simultaneously, the economic situation would certainly improve significantly. However, the county magistrate delayed reviewing the emergency order for over twenty days and routinely passed it on to the various departments for study, resulting in non-implementation for over a month. This demonstrates the incompetence and perfunctoriness of local administrative officials, which is a major obstacle to the success of economic controls.

### Security Council Discusses Berlin Incident: Three Powers Reaffirm Firm Stance: Refuse to Discuss German Issue Until Blockade is Lifted

[News from Our Newspaper] Paris, 19th Radio: The Security Council met in the afternoon of the 19th. Although Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky looked frail, he still attended the meeting. British representative Jebb spoke first on behalf of the Western powers, attacking the Soviet Union for intensifying the Berlin blockade. Vyshinsky coughed and sneezed frequently, interrupting Jebb's speech. Acting Chairman Parodi asked Jebb to provide details on the teaching and other relevant matters. Jebb immediately replied that the Soviet Union's various restrictions still existed, and any plan, its draft and implementation, under the pressure of the continuing blockade will inevitably suffer the same fate. Jebb hoped that the Security Council would accept the Western view that negotiations cannot proceed under the threat of a blockade. He said that the credibility of the United Nations and the Security Council has reached a critical juncture.

At the same time, British representative Alexander made a statement that the Western three powers now have a feeling that it is impossible to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union even based on the agreement reached with Stalin on August 30. At that time, the Western powers had accepted in principle the Soviet mark as the sole currency of Berlin as a condition for lifting the blockade, but this agreement was later cancelled during the Berlin negotiations.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th] The Western three powers formally notified the Security Council on the 19th that they are unwilling to discuss any German issues with the Soviet Union until the Berlin blockade is lifted. The three powers also emphasized that the Berlin blockade is the only reason for obstructing the four powers from resuming negotiations on any or all German issues. When the Security Council began debating the Berlin issue, British representative Jebb, on behalf of the three powers, reaffirmed the firm stance of the three powers in the Berlin crisis. He answered the first of the two questions raised by the Security Council last week. U.S. representative Jessup will answer the second question later. The question answered by Jebb was: Regarding the details of the establishment of the blockade and the current situation, he presented a lengthy formal reply and accompanying documents, but only briefly explained the position of the Western countries. He warned the Security Council that the only issue raised by the Western countries in the Security Council is the Soviet Union's illegal blockade of Berlin. This matter is not only about resolving an acute dispute, but also related to the credibility of the United Nations. Referring to the Soviet Union's unilateral establishment of the blockade, Jebb said that this is a coercive attempt to prevent the other three occupying countries from exercising their legitimate rights. He then pointed out that the blockade has continued for over a month, which clearly violates the United Nations' provision that member states must not use force to achieve political purposes. Finally, he stated that "the fact is very clear that the continuation of the blockade is the only reason for preventing the four powers from negotiating."

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] The Soviet Union released its white paper on the Berlin issue at the United Nations meeting on the 19th. The document did not include a commentary on the historical documents presented by the Soviet Union in the negotiations to lift the Berlin blockade. The first text of the book is a note from the Soviet Union to the three powers on February 13, protesting the three powers' plan to establish a West German government. It is understood that the reason why the Soviet Union chose this text as the first article is to point out that the Soviet Union believes that the delicate Berlin crisis began at this time, not when the blockade was implemented.

### Israeli Army Advances on Gaza City: Security Council Orders Ceasefire: Proposes Three Conditions for Future Negotiations

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] The United Nations Security Council ordered both Arab and Jewish sides to immediately cease the fighting in Negev on the 19th. After receiving reports from United Nations officials that two ceasefire requests had been rejected, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution ordering both Arab and Jewish sides to "immediately and effectively cease hostilities in the Negev region." United Nations Acting Mediator for Palestine, Ralph Bunche, participated in the debate for the third time, refuting the implication by the Syrian representative, El-Khouri, that the Arab side was fully complying with the truce while the Jewish side was not. Bunche said, "Both sides should bear the responsibility for disrupting the truce." Bunche reported to the Security Council that Egypt had accepted the new Palestinian truce, but Israel's reply was effectively a rejection, received on the evening of the 18th.

He said that he had notified the warring parties on the 17th by submarine telegram of the order to accept an immediate and unconditional four-day truce. Egypt stated that it would accept a truce if Israel accepted it, but Israel only proposed negotiating with Egypt to peacefully resolve the Negev dispute, ignoring the request for a truce.

The ceasefire order of the 19th is the Security Council's third main resolution on the Palestinian issue. During the voting, the Soviet Union refused to vote on Bunche's proposal to determine the conditions for future negotiations on the Negev issue because the Security Council had not yet discussed it. The only important matter at present is to issue a ceasefire order. The Security Council's proposed conditions for negotiation are as follows: (1) Both Arab and Jewish sides withdraw their troops from the territory recently occupied during the conflict in Negev. (2) Both sides accept the protective orders of the United Nations Truce Supervision Commission. (3) Both sides agree to resolve the main issues of Negev through United Nations mediators or direct negotiations, and allow United Nations observers to be permanently stationed in the area.

[Agence France-Presse, Amman, 19th] According to reports from Arabs who have fled from that retreat, Jewish planes and artillery have heavily bombed Gaza, causing severe damage. The city has been captured by the Jewish army today, but there has been no official announcement to confirm this news.

[Associated Press, Negev, 19th] Israeli troops have advanced to within five miles of Gaza, and Egyptian strongholds are under Jewish artillery fire. The Jews have broken through the Egyptian front line fifteen miles from Majdal and Bureij from the north-east towards Gaza. It is claimed that the main force of Jewish troops who had rushed into the Shahan area of southern Negev has already crossed the Fallujah front and has already encircled the wings of the Egyptian vanguard.

### Old ID Photos Still Usable on New IDs / Full Household Must Be Present During Census and ID Replacement / Those Without IDs Should Prepare Photos and Pre-Fill Applications

Regarding the measures for the periodic census and issuance of new national identity cards (these new national identity cards have punch cards) in this city, according to Director Xiao Song of the Civil Affairs Bureau: The detailed measures for this census have been decided as follows: (1) The new national identity card with purchase voucher and index card will be enthusiastically printed by the municipal government, and will be transferred to each district and distributed to each Jia (neighborhood unit). Three days before the census, all will be issued to each household, for citizens to fill out according to the format (copied from the old card) and affix a photo (photos from old cards are allowed to be cut and pasted onto the new card), along with the labor costs, old identity card and index card stored in the household. During the census, all members of the household must be gathered inside, remain stationary, and census takers will check each household and individual. The new identity cards will be collected, and after verifying that they match the household registration book for each Jia, the photo on the newly issued national identity card will be stamped with a line mark on the spot, and given to the recipient by name for safekeeping. All collected items will be filled out on a census taker's report form and submitted to the Bao office. All old national identity cards, regardless of which province or city issued them, must be collected. Those holding identity cards from other provinces or cities must first fill out an application for a new national identity card, affixing two additional photos, to be used for household registration verification. (2) The new national identity card should be filled out based on the actual population present during the census, one for each person, and should not be duplicated or filled out incorrectly. For those actually present who do not yet have an identity card, an application for a national identity card must be filled out in advance, with two additional photos affixed. If household registration has not yet been applied for, an application for household registration must be filled out first and submitted to the census taker, Citizens must complete all these applications on their own in advance, and should not fill them out at the last minute, so as not to affect the smooth progress of the census work. Each Jia leader should inquire and issue the various application forms when distributing the new national identity cards, to avoid being unable to handle them at the last minute. (3) The census will be conducted with the autonomous region as the census guidance area, with several supervisors. Each Jia will be the basic unit of the census, with two census takers per Jia. For larger households, such as factories, schools, hotels, and government dormitories, in addition to the census takers, the factory managers, union officials, school authorities, student associations, hotel managers, and personnel supervisors of government agencies should all be present at the time to assist in the process, in order to expedite matters and avoid errors. (4) When the census is implemented, traffic control should be implemented throughout the city. Detailed measures will be formulated separately. Director Zhang also solemnly reminded the citizens: Based on the above regulations, citizens who have already obtained a national identity card do not need to take photos again. Just cut out the old photo and paste it on the new card. Those who have not previously obtained an identity card must take three 1.5-inch photos and affix them to the new identity card and application form before the new card is issued, otherwise they will not be able to receive the new card.

### Adapting to Actual Needs / Citizens Can Purchase Five Sheng of Rice with ID Cards Starting Today

Rice merchants association representatives went to the Social Bureau yesterday afternoon to ask Director Wu to stop scalpers from buying up rice. Director Wu often agreed to the restriction on purchases and asked the Social Bureau to notify the rice merchants association. The original text is as follows: "The source of food for the citizens of this city is being actively dredged, but in view of the fact that citizens who do not understand the real situation still inevitably purchase without restrictions, it is inevitably inappropriate. Based on the actual need for rice in this month, two dou per person is calculated. In addition to the one dou of rice allocated per capita, one dou must also be purchased on the market. However, since there is only one sentence left until the end of the month, the actual need is only three and a half sheng. From now until the end of this month, it is temporarily decided that each person can purchase five sheng of rice at a time with a national identity card, and an impression will be stamped on the card to prevent crowding."

### Striving to Solve the Meat Shortage / Establishing a Joint Office / Collectively Purchasing Pigs for the Market / Prohibiting Restaurants from Over-Purchasing

[Report from this newspaper] The Economic Supervision Office is determined to solve the pork supply in this city in a unified way. At 4 p.m. yesterday, Secretary Cai Bairi, accompanied by Captain Cheng Yikuan, was ordered to summon eight representatives of the fresh pork industry in this city, Hong Wengao, Qin Qiankang of the pig industry, and Zhu Zhigao, Zhang Wubin, Fang Yongxiang, Gu Guanfu, Wu Hesheng, and Wang Weixia of the pork industry, for detailed discussions. It was decided to form a joint office of the pork industry in this city in the shortest possible time. The measures have been drafted by the meat merchants and submitted for approval, and the candidates can also be nominated soon. It is expected that the work can be promoted within two days. The function of the joint office is to gather all the forces of the pork wholesalers and purchasers in this city to purchase a large number of piglets from northern Jiangsu to meet the needs of citizens. In order to adapt to the actual market situation, it is also planned to exchange barley for pigs. After the piglets are transported to Shanghai, they will be registered and distributed, with 15% supplied to the restaurant industry and the remainder supplied to ordinary citizens. The restaurant industry must not over-purchase fresh meat at prices higher than the limited prices, otherwise they will be severely punished. According to the meat merchants, the recent shortage of pork is mainly due to the unsmooth source. In the past, the highest number of fresh pigs transported to Shanghai from other ports reached as many as 5,000 pigs per day, but currently it is only 1,000 pairs per day. Meat is different from other commodities, so there is no inventory. To ensure that this city has a sufficient supply of pork in the long term, it is first necessary to suppress the selling price of live pigs in various places.

### Coal Briquettes at Retail Stores / Demand Exceeds Supply / Limited to One Dan Per Person / Factories Rely on Inventory to Maintain

[Report from this newspaper] In the midst of material shortages, coal briquettes, a daily necessity, are also difficult to purchase. Major coal briquette companies used to be able to deliver by phone, but recently, due to too many panic buyers, they have canceled the delivery method. Customers must go to the retail store to pick up the goods, limited to one dan per person. Currently, large companies such as Yitaixing and Guohua are working day and night, with a daily output of about 30,000 dan. Among them, after removing coal briquettes allocated to public officials, educators, etc., about 100 dan are distributed to each retail store per day. This number was usually sufficient, but recently, due to the psychological panic of the general public, even if there is surplus coal at home, they will still come to buy it, resulting in demand exceeding supply. The limited price of coal briquettes on August 19 was 3.33 yuan per dan, while the cost of raw coal was approximately 10 million legal tender per dan. Currently, the cost of transporting coal from Hankou to Shanghai is approximately 5.5 yuan in gold coins per dan. Coal briquette factories are currently relying on inventory to maintain operations. After the inventory of coal is used up, if the price cannot be adjusted, the quality of coal briquettes will be greatly reduced.

### Gasoline Saving Committee Holds Subgroup Meeting to Discuss Principles to Be Submitted to the Mayor for Approval

[Report from this newspaper] Relevant departments of the Municipal Government held a gasoline saving review subgroup committee meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday in the office of Municipal Counselor Wang Guanqing to discuss the method for allocating gasoline in this city after the gasoline quota was sharply reduced. It is learned that the gasoline shortage has reached its most serious point.

### Secretary of the Sugar Industry Association / Granted Bail by Special Criminal Court Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Zhou, chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, and Zhu Guoming, the secretary, were summoned by the supervising director's office last Friday due to rumors of a black market in sugar.

However, according to the declaration of all directors and supervisors of the Sugar Industry Association and hundreds of sugar merchants in the industry, the sugar merchants under the association were originally engaged in wholesale business, not retail stores, and the external black market was caused by scalpers reselling for profit, which had no direct relationship with the sugar merchants. The sugar merchants also expressed their willingness to register and entrust the existing sugar for storage, and to supply it as much as possible, which has also been reported to the Social Bureau for record. The industry publicly appointed representatives to make a statement to the supervising director's office yesterday, and submitted a statement to the Special Criminal Court in the afternoon to apply for bail first, and to wait for a fair investigation. Therefore, Zheng and Zhu were interrogated by the prosecutors of the Special Criminal Court and were granted bail at 5 p.m. yesterday.

### Sauce and Liquor Industry Requests Allocation of Cooking Oil, Will Negotiate for Supply and Door-to-Door Sales

The second batch of 7,500 dan of oil supplied to the Shanghai Medical Association has reportedly been stipulated by the authorities to be allocated by the Oil Merchants Association to the Association for distribution to its members for door-to-door sales. The Association will negotiate for the allocation. In addition, a person in charge of the Association stated: "The report that oil wholesalers requested that cooking oil not be allocated to the sauce and liquor industry shows a feudal mindset and is not in line with the times. The members of the Sauce and Liquor Association are all guaranteed cooking oil retailers, and there are more than 2,000 of them throughout the city. Citizens rely on them to buy cooking oil. The request of the wholesale oil merchants not to allocate any oil is contrary to the intentions of the authorities' emergency instructions and is absolutely impossible."

### Bread, Biscuits, and Pastries Sales Unprecedentedly Booming, Raw Material Shortages Affect Production, Survey Needs to Be Compiled and Submitted for Unified Allocation

[Our Report] According to the bread, biscuit, and pastry industry in this city: in recent months, due to the unprecedentedly booming sales of products and the difficulty in replenishing raw materials, most factories have fallen into a state of semi-shutdown. The industry needs large quantities of flour, sugar, and diesel, all of which are currently impossible to purchase in sufficient quantities. Because the flour mills in this city have to supply the China Trust Bureau for storage every month, the industry can only rely on the quotas approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. Last week, the industry received 6,000 bags of flour, all of which were third- and fourth-class coarse flour. Each factory could only be allocated one shi of flour. In terms of quality, it was impossible to manufacture better biscuits and pastries. In terms of quantity, the products made within a week were often sold out within two days. For example, Guanshengyuan used to need 150 bags of flour every day, but now it has been reduced to 30 bags. The products that used to be enough for ten hours of business every day are now sold out in less than one and a half hours. At present, the general public seems to be very interested in scrambling for food. According to the statistical report of Guanshengyuan, the preserved fruits, chili sauce, olives, figs, pepper powder, etc. made by the store are all snapped up every day, and the purpose of these buyers seems to be to engage in single-handed transportation to other places for profit. The store believes that the quality of the puffed biscuits is the best and can only be preserved for five or six months at most, but currently, due to various conditions, the quality has been greatly reduced. Rushing to buy and hoarding will only lead to spoilage, so citizens do not need to buy and store large quantities. The industry is now aware that the raw material inventory of each factory is limited, and most can only last for one or two months. For example, the inventory of the largest-scale Sullivan factory will also be used up by the end of this month, so it has started to conduct a general survey to determine the actual quantity needed by each factory every month and request the authorities to find ways to make unified allocation to overcome the difficulties. In addition to flour, sugar, soda, lard, and peanut oil, which are impossible to purchase, diesel, an important fuel, has also been suspended for allocation since August, so it will also apply for allocation. In addition, the glass bottles, caps, and wrapping paper used by the industry for packaging are too expensive. In order to comply with the price limit, it has been decided not to use them in the future. As for the tinplate used for making packaging cans, the price has risen three times compared to before August 19, so the industry has also decided that the existing canned goods will only be sold until they are sold out, and it does not intend to order new cans.

### Diamond Charity Lottery, Draw to Be Held on Schedule

### Compensation Machinery Distributed at Discount Prices, Will Continue to Be Handled in the Future

Xian Baochang, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, told reporters today: "The method of distributing Japanese compensation machinery to private enterprises at 25% of the price will not be canceled because the first batch of price distribution work is about to be completed. This method will continue to be effective in the future." Mr. Gu said: "More than 2,000 pieces of machinery have been distributed at a discount in the first batch of compensation machinery. A total of 90 manufacturers have applied to purchase them and have already signed contracts and are paying and picking up the goods, accounting for two-thirds. The processing of the first batch of materials will be completed soon. For the second batch of compensation materials, our country can get about 140,000 pieces of machinery. Once they arrive in Shanghai, they will still be distributed to private industries according to the past ratio."

### Simplified Collection of Business Tax, Application to Participate by Deadline

[Our Report] The "Key Implementation Measures for Simplifying the Collection of Business Tax" and the "Organizational Regulations of the Review Committee" have been formulated and announced by the Municipal Government. The Finance Bureau specially held a meeting a few days ago and decided to convert the tax amounts for the four seasons of autumn and winter of the 36th year and spring and summer of the 37th year according to the regulations, average them, and discount them into gold yuan, which will be the tax base for this season. Taxes will be calculated based on this base first, regardless of whether to participate in the simplification or not. Applications to participate in the procedures must be submitted before November 15. Those who do not participate will have their accounts strictly checked, and then the tax amount will be determined. This time, because merchants could not fill in the tax amount themselves, they are required to follow the regulations strictly within ten days after receiving the tax amount notice. Those who fail to do so will be punished, and the regulations will be implemented in the next quarter. The Bureau has also studied the tax calculation technology and simplified it, and will issue a formula separately. This time, the base is based on facts to make general regulations. If there are a few cases that need to be adjusted, the relevant industry association has the right to assist the Finance Bureau in making appropriate adjustments to the base for the entire industry. After that, merchants participating in the simplification will save a lot of trouble after paying taxes in accordance with the regulations.

### Flying Train Derailed at Suzhou Station, Both Parties Released Details, Two Passengers Injured in the War Arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 am Yesterday, All Trains Were Blocked for Five Hours

[Our Report] After the unfortunate derailment of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Flying Train at Suzhou Station at 9:50 the day before yesterday, all parties expressed concern. Yu Buwu, Minister of Transportation, sent a telegram to the Railway Bureau to inquire. After receiving the news, the Administration Bureau immediately dispatched a rescue train led by Xie Zhen, Deputy Director and Director of the Transportation Department, to rescue the situation. At the same time, he telephoned the Qichang Factory to send an engineering team. Deputy Director Xie and all the staff returned to Shanghai at about 4:00 pm yesterday. At 5:30 pm, Deputy Director Xie met with reporters and released the details of the accident and the handling of the aftermath, roughly: The Shanghai rescue train departed at 11:35 pm on the night of the disaster. There was a slight delay in waiting for the handover car on the way. It arrived in Suzhou at 2:35 am yesterday and immediately started work. The correct time of the accident was found to be 9:50. When the train passed through Suzhou Station (the Flying Train does not stop at Suzhou (the third turnout, the bogies of the last 404, 405, and 408 (observation car) three cars reported derailment. The tiger's mouth at the connection between the 404 and 405 cars was broken by pressure, and the car body tilted to the south. The 408 car tilted slightly. The steel rails were intact, and 160 sleepers were thrown. The 404 car also collided with the locomotive of Train 84 parked on the adjacent track when it tilted. Eleven panes of the car window were broken, and three passengers were scratched on their hands and faces by broken glass. The injuries were mild. After being bandaged, they and other passengers in cars 404 and 405 were transferred to the four cars that were not derailed and continued to travel to Shanghai. They arrived at the North Station at 1:00 am yesterday.

The Cause of the Derailment Is Under Investigation

The derailment of the Flying Train at Suzhou Station caused traffic to be blocked for five hours and twenty-five minutes. The third turnout was repaired at 3:10 am, so all trains on the Beijing-Shanghai Line were delayed yesterday. The crane of the Qichang Factory arrived at 6:00 am at the latest, and the first tilted passenger car was completely lifted and placed on the track at 1:00 pm. As for the cause of the accident, various materials are being collected and studied in detail. According to Deputy Director Xie: According to the analysis of various situations, the driving speed at the time of the accident did not exceed 65 kilometers per hour, so the driving speed was definitely not the cause of the derailment. A review of the steel rails also shows that they were newly replaced, and the distance from the accident site to the stopping point is only 120 meters (the police braking is about 300 to 350 meters), which is also enough to prove that the driver is skilled and his actions are very agile.

The Timetable Will Be Rearranged

The Flying Train still runs as usual, but the last two ordinary first-class cars are replaced. It is said that the driving speed is still not affected. Today, the train will be completely replaced with ordinary passenger cars, and the driving time and fares will remain the same. The streamlined car will be sent to the factory for repairs, and it will be able to restore its original appearance around the first of next month. Deputy Director Xie also said: After the streamlined car is repaired and running, it will shorten the travel time to four and a half hours for the entire Beijing-Shanghai journey. At that time, the entire driving schedule will also be rearranged.

Yesterday, the Committee had contacted Nanjing, and it is expected that the order will arrive here today.

### Wool Textile Factory Plans to Exchange Products for Raw Materials

According to the wool textile industry, the equipment of wool textile factories nationwide is as follows: (1) 62,400 fine wool spindles, (2) 22,744 woolen yarn spindles, (3) 12,756 coarse ring spindles, (4) 29,541 coarse roving spindles, (5) 2,003 looms.

Among them, the Shanghai area has the most wool textile industry equipment: (1) 61,772 wool spindles, 21,064 of which are in operation, accounting for about 50%. (2) 14,036 woolen yarn spindles, 8,271 of which are in operation, accounting for about 58%. (3) 6,756 coarse ring spindles, 6,417 of which are in operation, accounting for about 94%. (4) 16,266 coarse roving spindles, 14,976 of which are in operation, accounting for about 92%. (5) 1,627 looms, 973 of which are in operation, accounting for about 59%. According to people in the industry, the reason why so few are in operation is due to a lack of raw materials. In the past, wool relied purely on imports, and part of it was purchased from the north. Recently, imports have been difficult, and the import quota for the seventh phase of wool has been canceled. Due to the situation in the north, it is impossible to purchase wool, and the current raw materials stored in Shanghai account for less than 20% of the required amount. Now that the wool textile industry's domestic wool fabrics and woolen yarn have reached world standards, it is planned to request the authorities to imitate the export methods of cotton textiles, export domestic wool textile products, and exchange them for wool imports to aid production.

### National Cotton Implements Joint Purchase, Stopping Factories from Freely Purchasing

[Our Report] The National Cotton Joint Purchase Committee held its sixth committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Liu Gongyun, and discussed and resolved the following major issues: (1) In addition to the 17 members who have already been hired, Shou Miancheng, General Manager of the Central Cooperative Bank, was hired as a member. (2) After the Executive Yuan announced the National Cotton Joint Purchase Method on the 16th, all factories should stop freely purchasing. Therefore, the request from factories in Hankou, due to a shortage of raw materials, to allow them to purchase on their own first was not approved, and a telegram was immediately sent to stop them. (5) The US General Assembly divided the recommendation that the yarn and cloth exchanged for US aid cotton should be allowed to flow into the countryside to exchange for cotton for domestic sales. The committee agreed to the suggestion and decided to mark the yarn and cloth for cash sales to the countryside to purchase cotton. (4) The committee will consider collecting finished products from each yarn factory for duplication cases to exchange for cotton or allocate them to the people for daily use.

### Textile Construction Distributed as Usual

The Textile Construction Company distributed goods as usual yesterday, but the types were extremely scarce. Only 12-pound trumpet B fine cloth, priced at 24 yuan (limited to retail stores), was offered for application. Auxiliary brand 28.5-yard serge, priced at 23.5 yuan (limited to dyeing factories), was offered for purchase. Jinyun Miaowu yuan serge, priced at 27.6 yuan per bolt (limited to retail stores), was offered for application.

[Another Report] Regarding the third phase of the second batch distribution for the dyeing and weaving industry, it was originally scheduled to hold application procedures at the Cotton Cloth Association market at 1:00 pm the day before yesterday. However, because the amount of goods was small and the distribution technology still needed to be improved, it was postponed until 10:00 am yesterday, when the Association convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss the matter. It is reported that the main issue was the wholesale merchants' request to continue to distribute the weaving, and the result was a decision to distribute as usual. As for this period's distribution, the industry's purchase procedures will be handled starting at 1:00 pm. It is estimated that more than 15,000 bolts of bed sheet cloth will be distributed in full.

### Cotton Market Dull and Soft

Since the Joint Purchase Committee announced the price of raw cotton, there have been no transactions among the industry, and the asking price in the production areas is higher than that in Shanghai. Cotton merchants' business has come to a standstill, and some households seem to have the intention to sell out.

### Cancellation of Bill Discounting

The Gold Control Bureau ordered immediate implementation

[Tai Bao News] The Gold Control Bureau recently issued an order from the Ministry of Finance to immediately stop all silver money banks and trust companies from charging customers for bill discounting. The Bureau has issued the order to the Shanghai Silver Money Trust Industry Association for all member banks and companies to comply.

### Slightly Reduced Arrivals Due to Rain; Rice Market Transactions Remain Sparse

Rice arrivals continued steadily. Yesterday, due to rain, arrivals were slightly less than the previous day. However, market transactions still showed no improvement. Most of the arrivals were distributed to a small number of rice shops, and the majority of rice shops still had no rice to purchase. Prices remained unchanged at the original levels. Yesterday's rice arrivals: Nanshi rice market and rice factories accounted for 974 piculs and one dou. Rice firms accounted for 42 piculs, Beishi rice firms accounted for 172 piculs, rice firms accounted for 167 piculs, factories accounted for 722 piculs, and outside businesses handled 50 piculs of rice independently, totaling 3,070 piculs for the two markets.

Flour remained unopened. In the coarse grain market, 50 packages of Jiujiang winter soybeans were traded at a price of 14 yuan and 6 jiao. Approximately 400 packages of customs-cleared raw peanuts for extraction and general merchandise were opened. Other corns, barley, and red grains were uniformly unopened.

Due to scarce purchases and sales in the Yangzhuang tea market this week, the process has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday's market was even more sluggish, but holders still firmly believe that production and inventory are both dry. The market sentiment remained steady as before, and the market atmosphere was still strong. Regarding Hong Kong export merchants' black tea, British demand is still urgent, so as soon as the weather clears, they plan to negotiate with sellers. As for domestic tea, buying interest from Chongqing and other regions is not obvious. As for Su, Xi, Chang, and other places, there are still inquiries, but unfortunately, the supply of old tea is not much, and transactions are narrow, so prices are remarkably high.

### Silk Prices Firm

The silk market situation continued to be sluggish, and transactions were deserted. Silk firms had more people inquiring for purchases and fewer people supplying. The public association allocated 35 small packages yesterday. It was heard that there were negotiations for raw silk exports yesterday, but no transaction was completed due to unmet prices. The inventory of domestic silk firms is very thin, and factories are also selling less. People are keen for profits, and most holders are watching the market. No transactions were heard.

Due to the difficulty in purchasing raw materials, finished products from silk and satin weaving businesses have become increasingly scarce. The inventories of various shops are still abundant, but many are unwilling to sell old stocks under price limits. There are no wholesale transactions in the market. Since purchasing with vouchers, sales at silk shops have become slightly less active, and most of the displayed colors are unpopular goods, so business has not been as prosperous recently as it was during the previous rush.

### Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee Approves Scholarship Quotas for This Year; Allocation Quotas for Each School to Be Decided by Review Committee

[Our reporter] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee met yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the fifth floor of the Shen Bao building to determine the scholarship quotas for students in various levels of schools for the first semester of the 1948 academic year, as well as the scholarship amount for each recipient. The total amount of scholarships is 150,000 gold yuan, and the scholarships will be awarded to 12,300 students. The allocation quotas for each school are to be decided by the committee at a review meeting.

Those present at yesterday's meeting included Chairman and Vice-Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Li Ximou, and representatives from various organizations. Chairman Pan first reported that the handling of scholarships this time was extremely strict. All schools whose free student quotas were not yet met were rejected when applying. When schools submit their applications, they must also report the total number of students in the school for the purpose of calculating the allocation ratio. Those who overreport will be dealt with by the meeting.

Number of Applications from Each School:

(1) Public colleges and universities applied for scholarships for a total of 1,393 students. (2) Private colleges and universities applied for scholarships for a total of 2,061 students. Among them, Daxia University has not yet submitted its application, and the free student quota for Guanghua University has not been met. (3) Public middle schools applied for scholarships for a total of 1,123 students. Among them, Gezhi Middle School and Tongji Affiliated Middle School did not report the total number of students. (4) Private middle schools applied for scholarships for a total of 1,705 students. Among them, 34 schools, including Minzhi and Zhengshi, did not submit a list of free students. 13 schools, including Guangcheng Pharmaceutical Vocational School and Xihua, did not meet their free student quotas. (5) Private primary schools applied for scholarships for a total of 3,558 students. Among them, Wenchang and Shanghai West Second School did not report the number of students. 16 schools, including Peimeng and Jiyang, did not meet their free student quotas. Chairman Pan believes that since school has already started for a long time, the distribution of scholarships cannot be delayed any longer. He hopes to conclude the work as soon as possible and allocate the funds that have already been raised first. If more donations are received later, another meeting can be held to review and distribute them. Subsequently, Secretary-General Zheng Jie reported that the committee had received a total of 100,636 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen in scholarships entrusted to it for distribution, along with funds directly distributed by donating organizations and pledged but not yet delivered, totaling approximately 150,000 yuan. The attendees discussed and determined the scholarship quotas for students at various levels of schools based on this 150,000 yuan, as well as the scholarship amount for each recipient, as follows:

Scholarship Quotas and Amounts: (1) Public colleges and universities: 600 students at 20 yuan per student, 300 students at 30 yuan per student. (2) Private colleges and universities: 1,000 students at 30 yuan per student, 300 students at 40 yuan per student, 300 students at 60 yuan per student. (3) Public middle schools: 800 students at 10 yuan per student. (4) Private middle schools: 800 students at 15 yuan per student, 400 students at 20 yuan per student, 300 students at 25 yuan per student. (5) Municipal suburban national schools: 5,000 students at 1 yuan per student. (6) Private primary schools: 1,800 students at 10 yuan per student, 700 students at 15 yuan per student.

Other Resolutions: Other resolutions were as follows: (1) Schools that overreport the total number of students will have their scholarships issued based on the actual number of students recorded by the Bureau of Education, and the Bureau of Education will punish the principals of those schools. (2) Schools that do not submit a list of free students will still be reviewed as usual. Qualified applicants will be notified to apply for free tuition from their schools. After the school's free quota is met, the meeting will review and issue scholarships. (3) Each school should submit the academic and conduct grades of scholarship recipients at the end of the semester for evaluation.

Vice-Chairman Li suggested at yesterday's meeting that, starting next semester, middle school and college students receiving scholarships should be required to fulfill some obligations, which will take the form of work-study. Attendees generally agreed with this principle.

### Shen Bao's Scholarship Procedures

The procedures for issuing Shen Bao scholarships are the same as those for the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, and each school must first submit a list of free students. Recently, some students from schools have inquired about the delay in issuing scholarships, thinking that they have been delayed. In fact, this is due to a lack of understanding of the procedures. We hope to urge the schools to submit the lists of names so that the work can be completed as soon as possible.

### Education Director Zhu Arrives in Guangzhou from Shanghai

### List of Foreign Universities Abolished by Order of the Ministry of Education

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] The Ministry of Education has recently abolished the list of foreign colleges and universities by ministerial order. This list was previously compiled based on surveys conducted abroad as a reference for guiding students studying abroad to enter foreign schools. The situation has changed since the war, and it is no longer convenient to use it as the basis for reviewing the qualifications of students studying abroad, so it has been expressly abolished. Although the current status of colleges and universities in Europe and the United States has been surveyed, there is no statistical list yet.

Finally, regarding the opening date of this year's Group B and C competitions, because the fourth football league has already begun, there are conflicts between teams and stadiums, and it is difficult to arrange the schedule. It was decided that the Group B and C competitions will be postponed until next April, and the competitions will begin after the end of the big football game. The third Mayor's Cup will also be held at that time. The League Handbook will be published soon, and teams will be notified to come to the meeting to collect it.

### Official Salary

— Zhu Lank

Since ancient times, being an official has been about serving the people, and although the goal is definitely not to get rich, at the very least, one must be able to solve the problem of eating. Therefore, the term "official salary," as the name suggests, simply refers to the living expenses of civil servants. Besides the official salary of civil servants, other things such as "tuition fees," "iron fees," and "envelope money" may have different names, but they serve the same purpose: they must be able to meet the minimum living needs in order to be considered reasonable. If the official salary of a civil servant cannot maintain a minimum standard of living, then it will inevitably affect the efficiency of their work, and in more serious cases, it will affect the prosperity or decline of the national fortune. The actual loss to the country is so great that it cannot be compensated for by reducing some budget figures.

The official salaries of past dynasties, as recorded in historical books, show that the official salaries of prosperous dynasties were generally higher than those of declining dynasties. In the Han Dynasty, after Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne and unified the world, the salaries of the Three Dukes of the Chancellor were 10,000 shi, the Lieutenant General was 2,000 shi, the Chancellor's Chief Secretary was 1,000 shi, the Court Commandant was 1,000 shi, and the County Magistrate was 600 shi to 300 shi. According to the Han scholar Gu's commentary, the so-called 10,000 shi actually represented 350 hu of grain per month, 2,000 shi was 100 hu, 1,000 shi was 90 hu, 500 shi was 77 hu, and 300 shi was 40 hu. Since the Song Dynasty, five dou were equal to one hu, but in the Han Dynasty, ten dou were equal to one hu, so even the lowest-ranking seventh-grade official had a monthly salary of 40 shi of rice.

After the Five Barbarian Invasions, which brought prolonged chaos, such as in the early years of the Later Wei Dynasty, there was actually no official salary system, so honest officials were extremely poor. The biography of Gao Yun in the History of the Northern Dynasties says: "Gao Yun had only a few thatched huts and wore patched robes. His house contained only salted vegetables, and he always ordered his sons to collect firewood for self-sufficiency." To be an official and be so poor was no better, if not worse, than the poor civil servants of today. The general officials of the time obtained their livelihoods from the wealthy. As long as they were good at cultivating relationships, they could do as they pleased. Their methods were quite clever. It was not until the eighth year of Emperor Xiaowen's Taihe reign that the system of issuing salaries was established, with each person receiving two bolts of silk and 2.9 hu of rice. The meager amount was incomparable to that of the Han Dynasty. Tao Yuanming's refusal to bend his waist for five dou of rice also occurred during that chaotic period.

After the chaotic period of the Five Dynasties, Zhu brought peace to the country. The official salaries of the Zhu Dynasty were: the Chancellor, the Privy Council Deputy, and the Privy Council Commissioner received 200 shi per month, the Military Commissioners of various armies received 150 shi per month, the Prefects received 50 shi per month, and the County Magistrates received 5 shi to 3 shi, with three grades. Compared to the Han Dynasty, this was still far behind.

The official salaries of the Yuan Dynasty were a system of mixed grain and salary. Salaries were determined by the size of the rank, and grain was determined by the complexity of the job. Salaries were higher, and grain was less. The Grand Tutor, Grand Preceptor, Grand Protector, and Left Chancellor received 15 shi per month, the Six Ministers received 8 shi per month, the Vice Ministers received 5 shi per month, and the Vice Principals to Doctors received varying amounts from 3.5 dou to 2.5 dou. This was somewhat like the current 3-dou rice ration for public school employees, but the amount was much larger than today.

The official salaries of the Ming Dynasty returned to a full-salary system of grain. First-grade officials received 87 shi of rice per month, from first grade to third grade the amount decreased by 13 shi to 35 shi, third-grade officials received 26 shi, sixth-grade officials received 10 shi, and seventh-grade to ninth-grade officials received varying amounts from 7.5 dou to 3 shi per month, still far less generous than the official salaries of the Song Dynasty.

Since the Qing Dynasty, the salaries of civil servants have deteriorated with each generation, becoming worse and worse. Today, from "selected" and "special" appointees to officials, except for those with special income, the difference is only between "slightly poor" and "destitute." Recently, the official salary has been pegged to a base of 40 gold yuan, but prices have not stabilized. The tragic future of civil servants is too painful to imagine.

### Morbid Training Institute

— Forgetting Self

After reading the article "The Maker of Idiots," I felt that the author wrote deeply about the current malpractices based on life experience and that it will surely win "a chorus of sighs."

That was an article about discussing secondary education. Here, I will talk about some practical elementary school education, although it is a matter of opinion, but it concerns the happiness of the next generation, so it seems that we cannot take it lightly.

I have traveled all over the elementary schools in Shanghai—excuse me for not quoting the lengthy names, because I am looking for the so-called "nationals," but I will not see adults entering school.—There are many children with pale faces or thin muscles, either congenitally deficient or poorly nourished later in life, and they have almost become annoying at home. So they are pushed to school.

After a series of "no credit for acquaintances" collection procedures, the school accepts the children and then performs the so-called "strict teaching and management" operation. Some even use the "emphasize the three subjects of English and mathematics" knife, and follow ancient methods. Although no one sees the process of concocting, only God knows what the intention is.

English is taught in the third grade, with memorizing, writing, and dictation. An eight-year-old child is forced to master a foreign language. How can he bear the heavy responsibility of the country!

In addition to Mandarin, there is also Chinese literature, plus measures. In addition to composition, there is also transcription, plus diary? Read a lesson, memorize a lesson, dictate a paragraph. Copy notes, check annotations. Some children write: "Bad! The place where heaven and earth are sacrificed." "Shui! Big lake." They are either inexplicable or vaguely understandable. Fortunately, they are not required to understand them thoroughly. They can just copy the same thing during the exam, not changing a single word, and they are considered good students.

In mathematics, there are written arithmetic, abacus, and supplementary difficult problems that jump over one or two years. There is no teaching of quick calculation skills here. Instead, there are countless difficult problems to make things difficult. Therefore, children's bodies and minds are dull. Schools are "serious" in the end.

Once a school has a "reputation," it is not afraid of being "full." There are narrow side rooms where nearly a hundred people are squeezed together. Some parents who are good at arguing insist on letting their children squeeze in, even standing to listen, which is very similar to Cheng Men standing in the snow.

A class lasts for three quarters of an hour or even an hour, which is said to be "genuine." Eight hours a day will certainly be more "attractive."

There is no method in teaching. This retro style is especially evident in "famous" private schools. As a result, children's physical fitness and habits are deteriorating. How can people not be worried?

What a sad, morbid training institute!

### Names and Places

— Lu Danlin

Regarding writing, especially writing related to historical events, personal and place names are necessary components of the text. Therefore, the interpretation of personal and place names varies. For example, "My friend Hu Shi" has already been criticized and need not be discussed. Other terms like "Mr.", "Jun", "Gong", "Zhang", "Weng", "Senior", "Madam", or "My Friend" are used depending on the relationship between the author and the subject and don't matter much. However, I advocate calling people by their given names directly, or first writing their style name, with the given name in parentheses, such as "Xu Jilong (Shi)". Afterwards, refer to them only as Jilong or Xu. If I have no relationship with them, for the sake of clarity and ease of recognition for the reader, I write their names directly, such as Xu Shichang, Zhao Erxun, Wang Yiyun, Qi Xieyuan, etc.

Currently, some people refer to officials of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, those who passed the imperial examinations, or bureaucrats from the Republican warlord era using terms like "Qing Bi", "Ke Jia", or their ancestral home, instead of writing their names directly. This kind of habit is a remnant of feudalism, such as Jia Wenzhong Gong, Yi Wenzheng Gong, Bing Zhenghui Gong, Ding Wenxiang Gong, or Zi Zhijun, Chou Zhongcheng, Yin Taishou, Mao Daling; or Chun Dianzhuan, Xia Taishi, Qiu Xiaolian, Dong Shangshe; and Zeng Xiangxiang, Weng Changshu, Kang Nanhai, Liang Xinhui, and so on. Such titles still appeared in the Republican era, which makes the revolution seem redundant. However, one point worth noting is that revolutionary figures with outstanding achievements did not like this practice, such as Chen Shaobai, Huang Xing, Hu Hanmin, Chen Qimei, Song Jiaoren, etc. No one ever called them Chen Xinhui, Huang Changsha (originally from those counties, but later collectively referred to as Changsha), Hu Panyu, Chen Wuxing, Song Taoyuan. During the period under the rule of the Northern Government, there were still titles like Yuan Xiangcheng, Li Huangpi, Feng Hejian, Xu Donghai, Duan Hefei, etc. However, no one within or outside the party referred to the Chairman of the National Government, Tan Yankai, or Lin Sen, as Tan Chaling or Lin Minhou, nor were the heads of the five Yuan referred to by their ancestral homes. From this point of view, it can be seen that society viewed the officials and gentry left over from the Manchu Qing Dynasty and the bureaucrats of the Northern Government in the same way.

After the collapse of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, from the beginning of the Republic of China to the collapse of the puppet state of Manchukuo, Puyi, even after he had become a so-called "emperor" in Changchun, still bestowed posthumous titles to some deceased former Qing officials, even "Wenzhong" for someone who had plotted a mutiny. At that time, Puyi was no longer the so-called "Great Qing Emperor"! Chen Shichen was not a subject of the puppet state of Manchukuo, so it is unknown on what basis Puyi posthumously named Chen "Wenzhong." This is truly a foolish person doing foolish things. And some people still follow Puyi's illegal pronouncements after the establishment of the Republic of China, which is truly incomprehensible.

Furthermore, some writers prefer to use ancient names for place names, such as calling Nanjing Baixia or Jianye, Zhenjiang Jingkou, Guangzhou Chuting, Wuhu Fanzi, Hangzhou Renhe, etc. This is reversing the times, forcing readers to consult old dictionaries to understand. In the 37th year of the Republic of China and still using this practice, it seems to be related to the times and thought. I cannot agree with this.

### Spring in Autumn

— Qian Dacheng

The day before yesterday, a friend told me that the crabapple blossoms in his house were blooming. (But not the autumn begonia, the so-called iron-stem crabapple, which blooms in spring.) Today, I happened to step into the backyard and saw that the peach blossoms were also budding. It is now the ninth lunar month of autumn. If viewed from the old perspective, this would be considered a disaster, perhaps something that could be recorded in the "Treatise on the Five Elements," under the category of plant anomalies. At the same time, people would sigh and lament, talking about the great principles of interaction between heaven and humans. Or some people would say that the weather has been too hot lately, causing plants to behave abnormally, which is not a big deal. The so-called tenth month is a minor spring. But unfortunately, it is still only the ninth month.

My personal opinion is that I am not surprised by this, but rather feel infinite hope. Now is autumn, and the people of the world are filled with the autumn chill, worried about future wars. But I believe that humanity will not be so foolish as to collectively embark on a path of suicide. The solution to humanity lies in humanity itself. The blooming of peach blossoms and crabapple blossoms in autumn already indicates to us that there is a breath of spring in autumn. "Spring is not my spring, autumn is not my autumn" - only the thoroughly pessimistic would say such things. We must strive, not just wait.

### Hollywood's Unsung Heroes

— Fei Yu

Hollywood's business relies on two things: stars and props.

Every film company has millions of dollars' worth of props of all kinds. These props are all collected by people who specialize in providing props. These people are all alert and resourceful. They are ubiquitous. As long as the director says he needs a prop, no matter how important or unimportant, they will always find a way to get it.

One movie scene needed a Spanish grand piano. A prop supplier managed to find one at an old lady's house, but there was no way to move it out. It turned out that a large window in the house had been sealed up after a burglary. Later, after spending a lot of money, the owner agreed to have the wall demolished. After the scene was filmed, the piano was moved back, and the wall was rebuilt. But then the director sent someone to say that the scene was not filmed well, and the piano needed to be used again.

Once, while a large crew was filming in the Mojave Desert, the director suddenly thought that the female lead needed a bouquet of flowers. Flowers? In a desert that hadn't seen rain in a month? But within two hours, the prop guy came with all kinds of flowers. He had stopped a train and bought them from the train.

Sometimes a few mosquitoes can also become a big problem. Robert Montgomery needed a few live mosquitoes in a new film, which was being shot in the dead of winter. The prop people searched every university and entomology institute, but all they could find were mosquitoes that carried malaria and yellow fever, so they couldn't be used. So they went everywhere looking for ponds with living mosquito larvae. When they found one, they brought the pond water back and put it in a greenhouse. Ten days later, Robert was filming with the mosquitoes in front of the camera.

In another film, the male lead had a scene where he was eating watermelon. The script was written in July, but the scene was not shot until January. So the prop people tried to preserve the watermelon. He first bought a dozen watermelons, waxed two, glued two, painted two, wrapped two in burlap, put two in the refrigerator, and put two on ice. A month later, only the two that had been frozen hard were good. But these two burst open as soon as they were exposed to room temperature and gradually turned into a soft, rotten mess. So he bought two more dozen, buried some in the ground, some in lime, and some soaked in water. A month later, they were all rotten. By then, watermelons were almost out of season, and he felt completely hopeless. He went and bought five more dozen of the best watermelons and preserved them using the different methods he knew. On the day the scene was to be shot, luckily, there was still one good one. He proudly took it to the director and told him the story of the watermelon. The screenwriter happened to be nearby and heard it.

"If I had known this would cause you so much trouble," the screenwriter said to him, "I would have just had the protagonist eat an apple."

These prop people are amazing guys, but they always hate the screenwriters and directors.

### Order

— Yi Jun

Anyone with teaching experience knows that maintaining classroom order is one of the most important and difficult issues. Good classroom order is the prerequisite for excellent teaching and also a sign of excellent teaching.

A classroom like a temple fair, with a cacophony of voices, is truly terrible order; but if the classroom is made to resemble an ancient tomb, gloomy and silent, it is also not what is considered good order in teaching. Therefore, Banlett said, "The symbol of good order in the classroom is not silence to the point of being able to hear a pin drop, but the sound of happy labor; not tense suppression, but strong activity." Therefore, "the management of order in the classroom is not about forcing activity, but about stimulating activity; not about prohibiting something or other, but about creating something or other."

Generally, teachers of the old model often strive to achieve "silence to the point of being able to hear a pin drop," at the expense of "suppressing activity" and "prohibiting something or other" for students, resulting in a lifeless classroom. - New-style teachers, on the other hand, often allow everything to become indulgent in order to make the students in the room express "the sound of happy labor" or "strong activity," trying to stimulate student activity as much as possible and "creating something or other" for them, opening the door to convenience; as a result, the classroom becomes a chaotic clamor.

The above two methods and situations are both strictly avoided in teaching. The ideal classroom order is: on the one hand, there is the sound of happy labor, and on the other hand, it is not chaotic and noisy. Achieving this state is the most difficult thing. In general, one gains on the one hand but loses on the other, and it is rare to be able to achieve both at the same time.

Now, let's broaden the perspective and apply it to social order as well. Relying solely on high-pressure tactics and not allowing people to engage in free activities is called a feudal approach; complete permissiveness, which fosters the arrogance and arrogance of the people, can also be said to be a distortion of democracy; the former is true feudalism, while the latter is false democracy, neither of which is the ideal of a new China and a new society. What is the ideal? It's very simple, to have both democracy and stability. But how to build this state? The current difficulty lies precisely in this.
