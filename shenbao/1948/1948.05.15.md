### Election of the Legislative Yuan President and Vice President to be Held the Day After Tomorrow; Voting and Ballot Counting Procedures to be Decided Today; List of Preparatory Committee Members of the Control Yuan Announced

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 17th during the sixth preparatory meeting. The fourth and fifth preparatory meetings will be held separately at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM on the 15th. The procedures for the election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, as well as the voting and ballot counting procedures, will be passed at the meeting on the 15th to ensure that the election can be held legally on the 17th. The 16th is Sunday, and the meeting will be adjourned for one day.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The third preparatory meeting of the first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution was held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:40 AM on the 14th. 411 legislators attended, with Wu Tiecheng presiding. First, the Secretariat reported on the minutes of the second preparatory meeting. Then, the discussion of the "Draft Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators" began. Legislators spoke fervently. Many believed that the draft procedures should include provisions for the removal of the President and Vice President. Some legislators argued that the "Draft Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators" was a procedural law to resolve the current situation, not a law, and should be discussed at the formal general meeting. The two sides debated fiercely without reaching a conclusion. Finally, Huang Yuren and 29 others proposed a temporary motion, arguing that the draft procedures should include "Procedures for Re-electing the President and Vice President." The chairman put it to a vote. Of the 434 legislators present, 292 voted in favor, which was a majority. It was resolved to hand over the original draft to the "Drafting Committee for Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators" for revision. It was decided that the drafting committee would continue to meet on the afternoon of the 14th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The National Government issued an order on the 15th: Appointing Liu Zhe as the Chief Commissioner of the Preparatory Committee for the Inaugural Meeting of the First Control Yuan, with Li Chongshi, Zhu Zongliang, Tian Jiongjin, Gu Fengxiang, He Kefu, Ma Yaonan, Li Sichong, Zeng Dao, Zhang Weihan, Wang Xinling, Li Zhengle, Wang Guanwu, Yang Zongpei, Liu Yantao, Cao Haosen, Wang Xuan, Yan Zhuang, Guo Zhongkui, Chen Yiying, Xing Senzhou, Li Zhaohuan, Mei Gongren, Li Buwei, Chen Hanzhen, Qiu Niantai, Cui Shuyan, and Yao Yuanchu as members of the Preparatory Committee.

[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] Control Yuan President Yu Youren has written to Chairman Chiang, requesting permission to retire. Chairman Chiang gave him three days to reconsider.

### Amendments to Legislative Yuan President Election Method; Adding the Clause of "Re-election"; Draft Committee Passed for Discussion at Today's Preparatory Meeting

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The Drafting Committee for the Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators held its fourth meeting at 3:30 PM on the 14th. Thirty-six drafting committee members attended, with Duanmu Kai presiding. They discussed the motion submitted by the third preparatory meeting that morning to add clauses for the re-election of the President and Vice President to the procedures for the election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators. There were two proposals forwarded by the preparatory meeting: one proposed by Huang Yuren, Qiao Pengshu, Gan Jiasheng, and others to stipulate clauses for the re-election of the President and Vice President. The added clause was: "If the President or Vice President of this Yuan is deemed incompetent, upon the proposal of more than one-tenth of the members, and with the approval of more than half of those present, a re-election may be held." The other was proposed by Wu Wangji and others, suggesting adding the following clause after the original eight items: "If the President or Vice President is deemed incompetent, upon the proposal of more than one-fifth of all members, and with the approval of two-thirds of the members present, a new election may be held." The chairman put it to a comprehensive discussion, soliciting the opinions of the attending members on the three items of "number of proposers," "number of approvals," and "wording of the added clause." Li Wenzhai, Jian Guansan, Peng Erkang, Wang Qiamin, Pan Chaoying, and others spoke in succession. Jian Guansan argued that the words "incompetent" should be deleted because it was difficult to explain what constituted incompetence. At the same time, to cultivate the fairness and justice of the Speaker, he should learn from the demeanor of the British Speaker, forget party positions, and prioritize the parliament. He hoped that this matter would be an unwritten rule and a standard of measurement for the re-election of the President and Vice President in the future. Peng Erkang, Gou Chaoying, and others spoke, all advocating for the stability of the Legislative Yuan and preventing the trend of overthrowing the President and Vice President at any time. If political tides are brought into the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan itself will fall into instability. Therefore, they advocated for more thorough regulations on the number of proposers and the number of approvals. Finally, it was passed to add "Article 8" after "Article 7" of the "Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators": "The President and Vice President of this Yuan may be re-elected upon the proposal of more than one-fifth of all members and the approval of more than half of the members present." The original "Article 8" "These procedures shall be implemented after being passed by the General Assembly" was changed to Article 9. This added clause is scheduled to be submitted to the fourth preparatory meeting for discussion on the 15th and Hu Shuhua was designated to report. The meeting adjourned at 4:20 PM.

### Association of Elected Legislators Releases Statement of Election

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The Association of Elected Legislators recently issued a statement raising several objections to the allegations made by the Young China Party's legislative candidates. The statement of the elected legislators was agreed upon by more than eighty legislators from Jiangsu, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Hebei, Liaoning, and other provinces and cities. They stated: (1) Some of them were non-partisan, and some were Kuomintang members who ran for office independently. They did not receive any support from the party headquarters during the election and were elected solely on the basis of their personal social standing and the support of voters. They were by no means the result of vote allocation. The Young China Party's legislative candidates claimed that the recent legislative elections were entirely the result of vote allocation by the Kuomintang and the government, which is at least an overgeneralization and is intended to taint the reputation of the elected legislators and insult the dignity of the voters. (2) Legislators should be trusted and supported by the majority of the people and elected through legal elections. The Young China Party's candidates repeatedly mentioned the three-party agreement and guaranteed quotas in their statements, which has deviated from the norm of democratic politics. It is already strange that candidates do not strive for voters but wait for the Kuomintang's guarantee and transfer. Even with the so-called vote allocation, the Young China Party also participated in election offices at all levels. How is it possible that these candidates cannot win over voters, and even cannot strive for vote allocation in election offices at all levels? (3) The legislative elections ended four months ago. If there was indeed any so-called vote allocation, the Young China Party's candidates should have exposed it earlier out of love for the Constitution and respect for democracy. Now, they did not do so, but waited until the guaranteed quota was not realized before they turned against each other with harsh words. This cannot help but raise doubts that it is purely for personal gain. At the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, a multi-party political system should be implemented. However, the development of political parties has its own established norms. If representatives of public opinion expect to be allocated, they will inevitably be rejected by public opinion. If they turn against each other because they did not receive the allocation, it is even less appropriate for a political party's style.

### Ma Hongda's Remarks in Lanzhou: Optimistic About the Northwest War Situation

[Our Lanzhou Correspondent, 14th] Ma Hongkui arrived in Lanzhou on the 13th, met with relevant leaders, and received dental treatment. He is scheduled to return to Ningxia within the week. Ma expressed great optimism about the war situation in the Northwest. He claimed that the bandit troops suffered heavy losses in the Lin You Mountain area, almost to the point of total annihilation. They will definitely be unable to spy outwards again in the next three to six months. However, the Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi bandit troops have been fiercely attacking western Henan in recent days. Their intention seems to be to echo the bandits in northern Hubei and southern Shaanxi. The National Army has long been aware of their plot and has made effective deployments. He praised the Longdong Army Corps for their effective killing of bandits, calling the Binzhou campaign the greatest victory since the suppression of bandits. Unfortunately, the Ningxia Army Corps had not yet come into contact with the bandits when they arrived from Sanbian, and the bandits had already collapsed and fled. Regarding the establishment of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Ma said that it has become a thing of the past, and he is old and weak and has no intention of taking on senior official positions again. If he can serve his hometown, he will be satisfied. Also, Ma Ji, Secretary-General of the Qinghai Provincial Government, took a children's song and dance troupe to Longdong on the 13th to comfort the troops.

### No Bandits in Funing City; County Magistrate Has Entered the City to Work

[Our Xuzhou Correspondent, 14th] Frequent victories have been reported from the front lines in northern Jiangsu. After Zhang Xuezhong's unit recovered Funing, they continued to deploy troops along both sides of the Tongyu Line to sweep south and north. According to a phone call from the front lines in Funing, as of the morning of the 14th, they have successively recovered the strongholds of Beisha (northwest of Funing), Dongkan (northeast of Funing), Goudun (south of Funing), and Chenyang Banhu on both sides of the Tongyu Line. There are no bandits within fifty miles of Funing City, and the county magistrate has entered the city to work.

### National Government Commends Personnel Who Died in Action Suppressing Bandits in Henan and Hebei

It is a pity and should be commended to show loyal spirit. In addition, Mu Yuntian, County Magistrate of Daming County, Hebei Province, participated in the War of Resistance, making many contributions. Later, he worked in the local area, led teams to suppress bandits, defended his territory with loyalty, and eventually died in action. It is a pity and should be commended to show loyal spirit.

### Suppressing Bandits in the Fujian-Guangdong Border Area; Chen Duca Killed

[Our Macau Correspondent, 14th] The military is redeploying in the Fujian-Guangdong border area, and troops are being transferred frequently. Bandit commander Liu Yongsheng and his chief Chen Ducai took the opportunity to operate. On the 9th of this month, they gathered more than 300 bandits armed with six light and heavy machine guns at Dalue Mountain in Pinghe, preparing to disrupt the border area on a large scale. The National Army learned of this and sent a large force to suppress them. They encountered the bandits in Niaolong Pit and fought for four hours. The bandits suffered more than 70 casualties, and Chen Ducai was killed on the spot. We captured two machine guns and many documents. Six officers and soldiers were killed or wounded.

### Issue of Quotas for Democratic Socialist and Young China Party Legislators; Chairman Hopes for Early Resolution; Summoned Zhang Qun and Others Yesterday for Inquiry

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] Chairman Chiang summoned Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, and others to his official residence at 9:00 PM on the 14th to inquire about the situation of the talks on resolving the issue of the quotas for the Democratic Socialist and Young China Party legislators. The Chairman also expressed his hope that this matter could be resolved as soon as possible. Lei Zhen took a night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM that night to exchange views with people from the Democratic Socialist and Young China Parties in Shanghai. Also, Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, Wang Shijie, Lei Zhen, and others discussed the issue at Wang Shijie's residence at 11:00 AM on the 14th. It is reported that regarding the issue of the Democratic Socialist and Young China Party legislators, under the premise of full cooperation between the Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, and Young China Party, the path to resolution will still be sought from the existing number of legislators. Efforts will be made to allow the Democratic Socialist and Young China Party legislators to reach a certain number as soon as possible, and the remaining numbers will be supplemented gradually. It is hoped that the legislators who have already been elected by the Democratic Socialist and Young China Parties will attend the Legislative Yuan meetings first.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, and Yu Jiaju of the Young China Party arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the 14th and immediately convened a Central Standing Committee meeting to discuss the issue of legislative elections and the future three-party cooperation methods. The meeting adjourned at noon and continued at 8:00 PM. When asked about the party's attitude towards the legislative elections, they said that it had not changed.

### Chairman Orders 500 Million to Reward Longdong Cavalry; National Army Recovers Dengfeng County

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] Military News Agency: This time, when Peng Dehuai's bandit troops invaded southward from northern Shaanxi and harassed central Shaanxi, the cavalry of Ma Jiyuan's unit of the Longdong Army Corps bravely fought the enemy and achieved rare brilliant results in the suppression of bandits over the past year, turning the situation in the Northwest from instability to stability. It has been learned that Chairman Chiang has telegraphed an order to allocate 500 million yuan in bonuses to encourage them.

[Our Xi'an Correspondent, 14th] The area bordering Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei provinces is becoming tense again. The bandits who were driven north by the Henan National Army from Jingziguan, and the Kong Congzhou bandit troops, about two brigades, who fled west from Xixiakou, have all fled to Xiping. One unit has fled into Fushui Pass, ten miles east of Shangnan County, Shaanxi, and there are attempts to continue westward. About two brigades of bandits in Yunxi, northern Hubei, fled into Xigoukou in Zhashui County, Shaanxi, and are engaged in fierce fighting with our local teams.

[Our Xi'an Correspondent, 14th] The remnant Peng Dehuai bandit troops who fled from Gansu into Shaanxi number only 7,000 to 8,000. One unit of about 5,000 fled into Malan and threatened to raid Sanyuan and Jingyang. The remaining unit fled through Heshui towards the central county. Our teams are cooperating with the National Army to encircle and suppress them in separate routes.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The National Army in Henan recovered Dengfeng County on the morning of the 13th and captured a large amount of supplies.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] After the recovery of Biyang and Tanghe, the National Army in Nanyang has launched mobile attacks. The National Army is now advancing victoriously to the southwest and is engaged in a fierce battle for Xinye. In addition, the bandits who crossed the Han River from Yun County and attempted to flee to Wudang Mountain have been blocked near Baliping.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Air Force here dispatched a strong formation today to attack western Nanyang, killing more than 100 bandit soldiers in Deng County. They also annihilated many bandits between Neixiang and Zhenping.

[Our Kaifeng Correspondent, 13th] Henan Chairman Liu Mao'en has been suffering from leg problems recently and has not received guests for a week. On the 13th, he specially met with this newspaper's reporter. In extreme pain, Liu responded to the reporter's questions about the aftermath of the fierce battles in western Nanyang, stating that the four counties of Zhenping, Neixiang, Xichuan, and Deng County in western Nanyang are not only strong fortresses in the southwest of the province, but also important military bases in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Shaanxi provinces. The bandits have paid heavy sacrifices over the years without breaking through. Their ambition to destroy the local armed forces in western Nanyang and spy on Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei has not died. Judging from their troop movements, it is known that they will launch another fierce attack on western Nanyang with a stormy momentum. At that time, the central government was repeatedly telegraphed, requesting that a large army be dispatched to defend the area. However, before the elite troops arrived, the bandits had already entered the house. The teams fought a bloody and arduous battle with 150,000 bandits with inferior equipment for nearly ten days. The tragedy and fierceness were unprecedented. It was not until the ammunition was exhausted and no reinforcements arrived that they were ordered to transfer to Hubei. As a result, all four counties in western Nanyang fell into the hands of the bandits. It is hoped that the supreme command will quickly dispatch a large army to encircle and annihilate them while the bandits are still catching their breath, remove the butcher's knife from the heart of the four provinces, and shatter their dream of spying on Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei.

### Drafting Committee of Legislative Yuan's Rules of Procedure; Heated Debate on "Exercising the Right of Consent"; Decides to Form Another Six-Member Subcommittee to Revise

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan's Rules of Procedure held its third meeting at around 3:00 PM on the 14th to continue discussing the initial draft of the rules chapter by chapter and article by article. Except for Chapter 8, "Exercising the Right of Consent," which was again the subject of lengthy and heated debate, and six people, including Bao Huaguo, Sun Guiji, Liu Butong, Qi Zhihou, Wu Wangji, and Chen Bosheng, were added to the seven-member subcommittee responsible for the main draft to integrate the opinions of the public and revise it, and a few other articles were also handed over to the subcommittee for textual consideration, the rest were passed after amendments. However, it will still have to wait until the fourth meeting of the subcommittee and the drafting committee at 3:00 PM and 8:00 PM on the 15th to deliberate and decide before it can be submitted to the preparatory meeting for discussion. At the meeting on the 14th, the convener committee member Qian Shuwu presided. As soon as he announced the start of the meeting, he continued yesterday's debate on the method of "exercising the right of consent." Those who advocated understanding the president's choice of candidate for Premier before exercising the right of consent were Bao Huaguo, Liu Minghou, Zhu Huiqing, Yang Yuqing, Peng Chunshi, Liu Butong, Sun Guiji, and Sun Shuqiao. Those who held opposing views were Zheng Yanfen, Chen Haicheng, Dai Xiujun, Zhao Pei, Zhang Duzhen, Chen Bosheng, and Chen Guyuan. The two sides were evenly matched and could not reach an agreement. The former still insisted that they could not exercise the right of consent without any basis or reason. Not only should they know who the president's candidate for Premier is, but they should also understand what his主張how and who he employs to carry out his主張how. The latter, in addition to still emphasizing that this kind of主張how has no basis in the Constitution, Zheng Yanfen also responded to the constitutional provisions. Bao Huaguo raised the argument that the cabinet is jointly responsible for this kind of主張how. He believes that consent and supervision are two parts of the Constitution. Article 55 only stipulates how the Premier is appointed as a matter before the establishment of the cabinet. Articles 57 and 58 stipulate that the cabinet is jointly responsible after the cabinet is established. The two sides debated fiercely for more than two hours. Although the proposal to maintain the original plan was rejected, the dispute over the revised text did not subside. In the end, no result could be obtained until 5:30 PM, when committee members were added to the main bridge subcommittee to revise all the articles of Chapter 8. In Chapter 9, "Hearing Reports and Inquiries," except for the provision that the submission of inquiries shall not be debated or inferred from facts, which was slightly discussed and decided to be handed over to the subcommittee for revision, the point of whether inquiries could be refused to be answered under certain circumstances was also debated before it was decided that responses could be withheld for the purpose of preserving national defense secrets or related international obligations. Chapter 10, "Reconsideration," and Chapter 11, "Minutes of Proceedings," did not have any special親定. In Chapter 12, "Order," some committee members considered the provision that "the number of members present who leave the meeting early shall not affect the calculation of the quorum" to be inappropriate. Xu Panyun advocated that if the number of people present is less than the quorum for the meeting when a member leaves midway, the discussion should be stopped immediately after the number of people present is checked at the proposal of a member. Chen Bosheng advocated that the discussion could continue, but no voting should be allowed. In the end, it was decided to hand it over to the subcommittee for revision. Chapter 13, "Committee Meetings," was passed smoothly. In Chapter 14, "Supplementary Provisions," the second half of the last article, "These rules shall be implemented after being passed by the meeting of this Yuan and sent to the President for promulgation," was deleted, and it was determined that the rules of procedure themselves do not need to be made into law. Finally, Ye Suzhong raised the question of whether the organization of the Committee for the Review of Member Qualifications and the election procedures for the President and Vice President should be included in the rules of procedure. Because the committee members all believed that it was unnecessary, it was not discussed. The meeting adjourned at 7:20 PM.

### Situation on Rehe Front Increasingly Tense; Contact Also Occurs Between Jinzhou and Jianping on the Beining Railway

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] Shi Jue flew to Ping yesterday to ask Fu Zuoyi for instructions. He flew back to Chengde by the same plane on the morning of the 14th. According to a spokesman for the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the National Army in Rehe has an absolute advantage. Even if the Communist bandits intend to open up a corridor from the Northeast to northern Shaanxi, they will eventually suffer heavy losses.

[Our Chaoyang Correspondent, 14th] Lin Biao is directing military affairs in Chaoyang.

Editorial

### After the End of British Rule in the Holy Land

At midnight on May 14, 1948, a long whistle sounded from the Government House in Palestine, announcing the end of thirty years of British rule in Palestine. After the British held a ceremony in Haifa to end their mandate, all military police stationed in the Holy Land have been concentrated in Haifa, preparing to withdraw back to their country. At the same time, the emerging Jewish state will be formally proclaimed on the 16th. Logically speaking, the liberation of the Holy Land and the birth of the new Jewish state are both preludes to a new era in the Middle East, and are worthy of celebration by the world. However, in reality, Jews and Arabs are still staging tragedies in the Holy Land to compete for the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway; and this tragedy is bound to intensify, and the Arab League countries are also in danger of being drawn into the vortex. Although the United Nations General Assembly is still discussing the Palestinian issue at Lake Success in New York, its only result can only be to appoint a Holy Land Conciliation Commission. The partition plan has been shelved, and no decision can be made on the trusteeship proposal put forward by the United States. In Washington, although they also attach great importance to the new developments in the Middle East situation, President Truman has repeatedly summoned Secretary of State Marshall to discuss countermeasures. Looking at the situation, they may not be able to discuss any foolproof plan. At most, they may only suggest to the UN General Assembly that the UN appoint a Palestinian commissioner to be responsible for mediating the Jewish-Arab conflict. Therefore, from today onwards, although British rule has come to an end, the Holy Land will still be plagued by war, which may spread and become a prairie fire in the Middle East!

Although the Palestine issue is a problem of religious and ethnic differences, if there are no external factors involved, the problem is ultimately simple, and it is not difficult to find a reasonable solution. To be honest, since the Kuomintang government ruled Palestine for thirty years, the conflict between Jews and Arabs has not stopped, and it has deteriorated to this point, which is the evil result of the struggle for power politics. British rule in Palestine has always adopted a "divide and rule" policy, not only failing to find ways to mediate the conflict between the two sides, so that they can live together peacefully, but instead using the contradictions of the Jewish-Arab conflict everywhere, pretending to be ambivalent, and placing itself in a pivotal position. Therefore, the British diplomatic authorities should bear some responsibility for the failure to resolve the Palestine issue for thirty years.

As for the United States, it seems that it has never had a consistent policy on the Palestine issue. At the beginning of the end of World War II, the attitude of the United States was clearly biased towards the Jews, advocating that Palestine should implement partition, and secretly supporting the Jewish Zionist movement. But recently, the United States has suddenly changed its attitude towards the partition plan, and advocated putting Pakistan under trusteeship. There are two reasons for this: one is the geographical factor. Because Palestine is not large, if it is divided into two countries, Jewish and Arab, neither of these two countries can meet the conditions of a modern country; this cannot be compared with the implementation of Indian-Pakistani partition in India. The second is the international factor. Because the United States' advocacy of the partition plan aroused the resentment of the Arab countries in the Middle East, and if the United States insisted on the partition plan, it would be impossible to implement, and it would inevitably arouse the anti-American sentiment of the people of the Arab countries, which would be enough to instigate the Arab countries to join the Soviet Union, and the United States has huge interests in the Middle East, especially the American investment in the Middle East oil industry. If it cannot win the friendship of the people of the Middle East Arab countries, then the interests of the United States in the Middle East will inevitably be hit first. Therefore, the United States had to abandon the partition plan and advocate trusteeship instead. However, the UN General Assembly has too many concerns about the trusteeship proposal put forward by the United States, and cannot discuss an appropriate solution, so it hesitates and has not yet made a decision. At present, it can only decide to organize a conciliation commission to mediate the Jewish-Arab conflict.

However, the prerequisite for solving the Palestine issue is to promote a ceasefire between the two sides. At the beginning of this month, the United States also wanted to take this path, and proposed a ceasefire plan to the Jews and Arabs. The methods were: (1) The United Nations Special General Assembly adjourned for ten days and suspended the discussion of the Palestine issue; (2) The Jewish and Arab parties should issue a comprehensive ceasefire order during the adjournment of the UN General Assembly; (3) The United Kingdom will postpone the end of the mandate, which was originally scheduled for May 15, by ten days; (4) President Truman will send a special plane to transport representatives of both Jews and Arabs and the American, French, and Belgian members of the United Nations Jerusalem Ceasefire Committee to Palestine to negotiate a ceasefire and submit a report within ten days. Once this plan was proposed by the United States, it was rejected by both Jews and Arabs. Looking at the four methods of transporting a ceasefire, we always feel that the United States' subjectivity is too deep, especially the extension of the British rule period is the most inappropriate. It is neither agreeable to the Jews nor Arabs, nor acceptable to the British authorities. Therefore, if the United States wants to propose a ceasefire method in the future, it must first consider whether this method is impartial to both Jews and Arabs.

The possible solutions facing the United States, in principle, are only three: (1) to maintain the original partition plan and strengthen or amend the implementation methods; (2) to abandon the partition plan and organize a unified and independent Palestinian state; (3) to temporarily implement trusteeship over Palestine. These three possible solutions can all be justified in theory, but there are difficulties in practice. Regarding the first one, in order to take care of the friendship of the Arab countries in the Middle East, the United States seems to be unwilling to advocate partition again. Regarding the second method, the so-called unified and independent Palestinian state is bound to be a country in which Arabs occupy a superior position. The legitimate interests of Jews are by no means guaranteed. Not only will Jews express opposition, but other countries will not express approval. Regarding the third type, the implementation of trusteeship is equivalent to a mandate. Not to mention that both Jews and Arabs will oppose it, even the United Kingdom is unwilling to "take chestnuts out of the fire" and suffer for others again. In short, the deteriorating situation in Palestine is enough to lead to a prairie fire in the Middle East. Since the United States cannot avoid reality and responsibility, it must take active and effective measures to ensure that the fire in the Middle East does not spread!

### Allied Forces' Policy of Supporting Japan; General Labor Union Sends a Telegram to Protest; Firmly Insisting That Aggressive Forces Should Be Thoroughly Destroyed

[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 14th] The National Federation of Labor Unions held its first temporary meeting of directors and supervisors on the 13th, and resolved the following important cases: (1) Expressing a solemn attitude in a telegram regarding MacArthur's policy of supporting Japan, (3) Telegraphing the Secretary-General of the British Transport and General Workers' Union to express approval of his proposal at the World Federation of Trade Unions, (3) All provincial and municipal general labor unions and national federations of industrial labor unions will, in the future, submit documents to the central competent authorities through the general union for review and transfer. The telegram sent by the association to Marshal MacArthur is as follows: To Marshal MacArthur, Honorable Sir, Japanese militarism and financial groups are the forces that destroy world peace and trample on the Far East. Therefore, the Allied governments repeatedly stated before and after Japan's surrender that they should be thoroughly destroyed. However, in the past year, the Allied Forces have repeatedly violated the original policies of the Allied countries, and the policies towards Japan have gradually changed. Among them, the abandonment of the Far East Commission's Document No. 230 plan, allowing financial groups to rise and rearming Japan, is the most worrying. China has been invaded by Japanese aggressors for as long as seventy years, and Chinese workers have suffered even more. Therefore, our country's five million organized workers cannot but raise a serious protest against the Allied Forces' policy of nearly sowing the seeds of aggression. Chinese workers sympathize with the Allied Forces' efforts to raise the standard of living in Japanese industry, but the current measures have exceeded this limit. The consequences will not only make Japan a terrible aggressive force in the economic field, but also become Germany after World War I in the military field, and have the possibility of making a comeback. This association, on behalf of China's five million workers, protests to the Marshal, and hopes that the Marshal can accept the opinions of the people and governments of the Allied countries and make corrections. This is our sincere prayer.

China can obtain 247,500 tons in the first half of this year.

### Regulations on Banning the Sale of Imported Luxury Goods; Ministry of Economic Affairs Sets Implementation Date for August 1

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 14th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted regulations for banning the sale of imported luxury goods, which will be implemented simultaneously nationwide from August 1. These regulations were drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs based on the outline of the "Strictly Enforce Economy and Save Expenses" method, and are the draft measures for banning the sale of imported luxury goods. The original plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, and once approved, it will be prepared for implementation as scheduled. The regulations stipulate that the luxury goods to be banned include items that are prohibited from import and temporarily suspended from import, but domestic goods are not included in the ban. For all banned items that still remain on the market after the announcement of these measures, they should be allowed to sell them off quickly on their own. If they are not sold out by the end of July 1948, they will be punished in accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing National Mobilization" once they are found, and they will be confiscated. This work will be managed by the Social Affairs Bureau in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, and by the county (city) governments in counties (cities). From August 1, 1948, the local police agencies will be convened or supervised to conduct general inspections or spot checks of stores, stalls, or other markets for buying and selling goods. Items seized should be sealed on the spot or sent to the competent authority for inventory and safekeeping. The competent authority should appraise them within five days. Those that are deemed not to be banned items or are domestic goods should be unsealed or returned immediately. The appraisal work will be carried out by an appraisal committee for banned items organized by the competent authority inviting three representatives from the local commodity tax bureau, the council, and the relevant trade association, who will be responsible for appraisal and make a record of the appraisal for future reference. If it is determined that they are indeed banned items, the appraisal personnel should be responsible for sealing them up and reporting them to the superior authority on a monthly basis for transfer to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for future reference. If there is any theft, replacement, or shortage, they should be severely punished according to law. Confiscated items, if no appeal is filed after thirty days have passed since the delivery of the punishment order, the competent authority should periodically invite local public opinion organs and various organs and legal entities to jointly verify the type and quantity of goods before publicly burning them, and report to the superior authority for transfer to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for future reference.

### Molotov's Trusted Advisor, Malik, Suddenly Flies to America, Carrying a Secret and Important Mission; Gromyko to be Recalled to Moscow

[Reuters, London, 13th] According to a British official spokesman in Berlin, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik left Berlin on the 13th and flew to London en route to New York, accompanied by Lobatenko, a key member of the Soviet Foreign Ministry. This sudden trip by Malik has aroused much speculation in London. Malik, formerly the Soviet ambassador to Tokyo, is one of the Soviet Union's leading experts on Far Eastern affairs. It is rumored that Malik's sudden trip to the United States is related to an urgent mission concerning the Korean issue. Secretary of State Marshall's remarks yesterday pointed out that Korea, Berlin, and Vienna are the three key points of friction between the United States and the Soviet Union. British experts who have had contact with Malik invariably regard him as one of the Soviet Union's most capable and promising young diplomats. However, a dispatch from Washington stated that a State Department spokesman said that to the best of the State Department's knowledge, Malik's trip to the United States was merely to join the Soviet delegation to the United Nations. The spokesman declined to comment on the possibility that Malik's trip was related to the recent exchange of views between the United States and the Soviet Union, but said that Malik's U.S. visa application was made before the United States initiated the exchange of views with the Soviet Union on the current situation.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] According to a report by the "Evening Standard" correspondent in Berlin, two mysterious Soviet envoys departed from Berlin yesterday and flew to New York. One of them, named Malik, is known as "Molotov's personal representative." Their mission is very mysterious. They stayed in the VIP lounge at the airport while transiting through London and refused to meet anyone.

[United Press, Lake Success, 13th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko will soon be relieved of his post as the Soviet Union's chief representative to the United Nations. Gromyko's position will be taken over by another Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Malik. Gromyko himself confirmed that he will leave his post as Soviet representative to the United Nations within a few weeks and return to the Soviet Union to take a long-delayed vacation. Asked whether he would return to his post when the United Nations holds its General Assembly in Paris this autumn, Gromyko shrugged and smiled, saying, "I know nothing." Even if this development is temporary in nature, it is enough to indicate a major change in the Kremlin's diplomatic personnel.

### U.S. Authorities Clearly Warn the Soviet Union That its Expansionist Policy Should Have Limits; The Soviet Union's Publication of Confidential Exchanges Has Three Effects

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Senior U.S. government officials said that the aim of U.S. foreign policy remains to inform the Soviet Union that its expansionist policy should have certain limits, and that exceeding these limits would inevitably risk causing tragic consequences. Since Moscow unilaterally published the contents of the confidential U.S.-Soviet exchanges of views on the current situation, the State Department has been engaged in reorganizing U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations in order to carry out a thorough overhaul.

U.S. officials did not specifically explain the "limits of Soviet expansion" that the U.S. government recognizes, nor did they characterize their geographical location, but pointed out that certain areas, including Greece, Iran, and Norway, are areas that the U.S. government considers to be of major strategic importance. The U.S. government will do its utmost to prevent these areas from falling under communist control. U.S. diplomats also believe that if Germany and Japan had known before World War II that certain of their actions would lead to war, they might have stopped such actions before it was too late.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The motivation behind Moscow's publication of the contents of the exchanges between Molotov and Ambassador Smith remains a mystery. Observers speculate that the Soviet move has three effects: (1) to alienate the United States from Western Europe in order to hinder the progress of the Marshall Plan and U.S. support for the Western European alliance; (2) to confuse American public opinion at a time when the U.S. Congress is debating military appropriations and military aid to the Western European alliance; (3) to provide propaganda material for global communists, pointing out that the United States rejected the Soviet Union's peace proposals and making people believe that the current tension is caused by the United States. The timing of Moscow Radio's publication of the full text of Molotov's statement and part of Smith's statement is particularly noteworthy. Moscow Radio broadcast the statement in the evening, so the official reactions from Washington or Europe would not be available until the next morning at the earliest, and the broadcast also came shortly after Ambassador Smith left Moscow for a vacation in France, clearly with the intention of denying the United States or the U.S. ambassador an immediate opportunity to explain. Therefore, before the United States had a chance to make a statement, the whole world knew that the Soviet Union had launched a peace offensive in the Cold War. In this regard, the Soviet scheme has obviously succeeded, and before Marshall made a statement, world public opinion, though not expressing relief upon hearing Moscow's broadcast.

### Truman Disapproves of U.S. Anti-Communist Bill

According to Dr. Wang Youqi, Professor of Anatomy at Shanghai Medical College, they have now requested the Ministry of Education and relevant parties through the Anatomy Society to expedite the formulation of regulations for the provision of corpses for physiological anatomy required by medical schools, including legal procedures and all technical conveniences.

If no one claims them after two months, they can be supplied to students for dissection. To this day, dead people are still precious items, with one corpse allocated to every six students.

### Sports Events Reach the Final Stage, Swimming Also Enters the Intense Competition, Three New National Records Continue to Appear

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the tenth day of the National Games. The men's and women's swimming competitions have been held for three days. The weather is beautiful, and new records are emerging one after another. There are three new national records broken: (1) In the men's 100-meter freestyle final, Wu Chuanyu from Indonesia achieved a time of 1 minute and 3.3 seconds. (2) The Hong Kong team achieved a time of 2 minutes and 35.6 seconds in the women's 200-meter freestyle relay final, both of which are new national records. (3) The results of the two groups in the men's 200-meter freestyle relay preliminary round also broke the national record. The men's 100-meter backstroke preliminary round and semi-final both broke the conference record. Today is the last day of the swimming competition, and all events will be completed. Judging from the results of the past three days, it is hoped that nine out of ten old swimming records will be broken, which is the most fruitful harvest of this National Games. The Hong Kong team still leads in the scores of both the men's and women's groups, and there is no doubt that they will win both championships.

The finals of the ball games have reached the final stage. The champions of soccer, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's singles tennis, men's and women's volleyball, and men's softball will be produced today. The unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere of the final round of the championship finals today is predictable.

In the international track and field competition, the Chinese representative team organized by the outstanding athletes of the National Games will hold a friendly competition with the Western United team organized by Western expatriate groups in this city at the track and field ground starting at 10:00 a.m. today.

### Hun Jianglong's Fighting Spirit Remains Strong, Water Performance Resembles a Dragonfly Skimming Water

Men's 200m Relay, Two Groups Dominate, Malaysian Chinese Team Achieves 1 Minute 57.6 Seconds

[Our Report] Yesterday's swimming events were held in the morning and afternoon. Among the three morning events, the men's 200-meter freestyle relay preliminary round was particularly outstanding. The competition process is described as follows:

Women's 100-meter Backstroke Preliminary Round: Divided into two groups, the top four from each group advanced. Huang Bixia from Malaysia won the first group, while Zheng Yanying, a 14-year-old young athlete from Guangzhou, won the second group. Zheng swam with good momentum, but her stamina was insufficient due to her young age, slightly affecting her performance. However, she was praised by the audience and received a warm applause.

Men's 200-meter Freestyle Relay Preliminary Round: Both groups broke the national record of 2 minutes 1.1 seconds, a major achievement of yesterday's event. The Malaysian Chinese team won the first group with a time of 1 minute 57.6 seconds, and the Guangzhou team won the second group with a time of 1 minute 59.9 seconds.

In the first group, the competition between the Malaysian Chinese team and Hong Kong was extremely fierce and exciting. The first two swimmers were almost evenly matched. In the end, Feng Zhaoyu of the Malaysian Chinese team had excellent speed, surpassing the Hong Kong team by a distance of seven meters. The members of the Malaysian Chinese team were Zhang Shoushan, Tan Qingren, Chen Nengde, and Feng Zhaoyu. The Hong Kong team consisted of Cai Liheng, Zhang Xianlin, Liu Dibing, and You Shikun.

In the second group, the swimmers entered the water after three false starts. Guangzhou took the lead after the second swimmer and maintained the advantage until the finish line, defeating the Navy team by a margin of three meters. The Guangzhou athletes were Chen Chaochang, Cai Guoqing, Luo Yurong, and Wu Nian. The Navy team consisted of Xu Heng, Wu Enhui, Liu Xinghua, and Liu Xinmin. The Indonesian Chinese Overseas Chinese team could not participate due to an insufficient number of representatives, which was regrettable to many. Indonesia had performed excellently in the short-distance events this time, and there was no doubt that they would have created a new record otherwise.

Men's 1500-meter Heat: The first group was held in the morning, with five participants. Chen Chuan from Guangxi withdrew halfway, and only four athletes reached the finish line. Liu Dibing from Hong Kong won first place with a time of 25 minutes 7.5 seconds, followed by Guan Huawen from Malaysia in second place, and another Hong Kong athlete, You Shikun, in third place.

In the afternoon swimming events, six events were held according to the scheduled order, among which the finals of the men's 100-meter freestyle and the women's 200-meter freestyle relay were particularly outstanding, both breaking the national records. Two water polo demonstration matches were not held due to the withdrawal of the Philippine Chinese and Guangzhou teams. The competition process of each event is recorded as follows:

Men's 100-meter Backstroke Semifinals: Divided into two groups, the top four from each group advanced. In the first group, the famous Shanghai player and the young Indonesian Chinese player Zhong Tiansheng faced off, inevitably leading to a fierce competition. However, after the turn, Lao Wang led all the way and completed the entire course in 1 minute 22 seconds. In the second group, Feng Zhaoyu from Malaysia dominated from start to finish, finishing nearly ten meters ahead of the second-place Philippine Chinese player Li Fanleng, with a time of 1 minute 17.7 seconds. The results of both groups broke the event record.

Diving Performance Preliminary Round: As the bell rang three times, the diving performance competition began. There were 14 registered participants, but only 10 actually participated. One person withdrew halfway, so a total of 9 people completed the entire competition. In yesterday's preliminary round, each participant performed eight dives from the low springboard, with four basic dives and four freestyle dives. The basic dives included: (1) Front entry (front swallow dive), (2) Running forward somersault entry (front scythe dive), (3) Standing back entry (back swallow dive), (4) Standing backward somersault entry (back scythe dive). Each participant chose four of their best freestyle dives and performed them with their best effort. The scores were determined by the subjective scores given by the three judges on-site, and the ranking of each person was determined by the total score. Among the nine divers who participated yesterday, Tan Qingren from Malaysia was the tallest and thinnest. However, when this diver dived, he was as light as a swallow. He ran on the springboard, and the pace was just right. He stepped on the end of the springboard with a light and appropriate force, and his body stretched and flew up, entering the water at a 45-degree angle without deviation, looking like a dragonfly skimming the water from a distance. The audience applauded thunderously. This was the highest-scoring dive in the basic dives yesterday. The thin Tan scored a lot of points in several basic dives, laying the foundation for his championship in the preliminary round. Chang Dexing from the Navy was short and sturdy, with a beautiful outline, in contrast to the thin Tan. This diver practiced the front and back swallow dives so naturally, like eating a simple meal. Who knew that when he went to the competition yesterday, his best style went wrong. Fortunately, he made up for the lost points in the three freestyle dives, including the front and back scythe and the front and back somersault. He needs to work harder today to compete with the thin Tan. Gu Jiaju from Guangzhou had a moderate build. His second dive, a front and back one-and-a-half somersault, was the highest-scoring dive in the freestyle dives yesterday. The Shanghai veteran Wang Anxiang has gained weight, and his body is not as agile as before. Deng Molin, a major general in the Army, reportedly won third place in diving at the 6th National Games. He relived his old dream after his military life. It seems that he lacks practice, and he chose several strenuous and unrewarding postures. He was at the bottom of the preliminary round. He should work harder today to show his heroic qualities.

### Shanghai Team Penalized and Suspended, Championship Situation Changes, Only One Football Decisive Battle Today, Police and Army Clash, Related to Championship Gain or Loss, Police Team Will Go All Out

[Our Report] In the football round-robin tournament of the National Games, since the Army team filed a protest and the Police team issued a statement a few days ago, the championship contention has encountered hidden reefs. The Judging Committee yesterday specially discussed this matter in detail. As a result, it was decided that the Shanghai team voluntarily abandoned the competition. According to the competition rules, they should be suspended from the competition, and all the results obtained by the Shanghai team in the round-robin finals will not be counted. After the announcement of this decision, the situation of the round-robin tournament has completely changed as follows:

Unit Played Wins Losses Draws Goals Scored Points

Police 2 0 0 1 1 1 point

Hong Kong 2 1 0 1 3 3 points

Army 2 0 1 0 0 0 points

The most affected by this are the Police and Army teams, each losing two points. Today's match between Hong Kong and Shanghai, due to Shanghai's disqualification, the Hong Kong team has a bye. The team will rely solely on the three points obtained in the previous two matches to compete with the Police for the championship. The Police and Army teams were originally scheduled to meet at the athletic field at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow. However, the Police team stated that the conference will close on the 16th, and they have already purchased plane tickets, and all team members are scheduled to fly back to Guangzhou on the morning of the 16th, making it difficult to participate in the competition within the above-mentioned time. Therefore, the conference has decided to reschedule the match to 4:00 p.m. today. If the Police team can defeat the Army team today, their score will be equal to that of the Hong Kong team. Whether they can win the championship will depend on whether their goals scored can exceed 2-0, otherwise it will be the same as the Hong Kong team, and there will inevitably be further disputes. As for the protest previously filed by the Army, it was officially returned by the conference yesterday. Today's victory or defeat of the team will directly determine who belongs to the champion and runner-up teams. Its importance is worthy of attention.

### Football Elimination Match, Dispute Arises in the Beijing-Hubei Match

Team Members Insult Referee, Disqualified from the Competition

[Our Report] Yesterday, there were only two elimination matches in the football competition. The Navy defeated the Philippine Chinese team 2-0, and Nanjing defeated Hubei 1-0. In the Beijing-Hubei match, the Beijing team scored a goal in the first half. In the last two minutes of the second half, two Hubei team members, Yan Zhenzhang and Zhu Yunong, were dissatisfied with the referee Zhu Quan's decision on offside, causing a dispute. The match could not be finished, and the Hubei team was ruled to have forfeited the match, ending abruptly with a score of 1-0. Afterwards, Zhu Quan submitted a report to the conference, stating that the Hubei team had insulted the referee. After deliberation, the Judging Committee decided to disqualify the Hubei team from this year's football competition and ban Yan and Zhu from participating in the next conference's football competition. Looking at the elimination matches, there are now only three teams left competing: Hai Ping, Sichuan, and Nanjing. The Navy will encounter them at Yi Yuan at 4:00 p.m. today. The Navy has a higher chance of winning. If the Navy can defeat Sichuan, they will face Nanjing again at the athletic field at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. After this match concludes, the champion of the elimination matches can be smoothly produced.

### Two Southern Speedboats Leave Shanghai's Slow Train Behind, Chen Zhennan Dominates 1500-Meter Freestyle, Wu Chuanyu Breaks National Record Again in Men's 100-Meter

The diving performance took a full hour and ten minutes. Immediately following was another fatigue bombardment, the second group of the 1500-meter freestyle heats entered the stage.

Looking at the list, fortunately, there were two southern speedboats, Chen Zhennan and Huang Jinhua, participating, supplemented by Luo Jinlong, the son of a Tianjin high-ranking official, and Huang Yunsen, Shanghai's slow train, for a total of four people. After swimming half the distance, Chen Zhennan left Huang and Luo behind by as much as 75 meters. Chen's absolute advantage and Huang Yunsen's backwardness had already determined the champion and last place. The problem was the two, Little Huang and Old Luo, who did not give way to each other, followed each other closely, and when the two changed breaths, one to the left and one to the right, they happened to face each other, watching each other's progress clearly, so that the entire pool of 30 laps almost fought to the end. In the last 50 meters, Little Huang was ultimately young and strong, and he unexpectedly still had a burst of energy left to prepare for the final sprint. Old Luo was finally defeated, falling behind by 5 meters. Turning around, the slow train Huang Yunsen was still leisurely paddling. No one could count how many laps he had fallen behind. However, he was not discouraged by his defeat. The starter actually aimed at the top of his head and fired a shot during his last lap. The slow train looked like it had just started a fire and accelerated to complete the entire course. When he got up, the Shanghai audience gave him warm applause. He represents Shanghai, and Shanghai lacks swimming champions. At least this sporting spirit is worth praising.

Men's 100-meter Final: This was the most watched event of yesterday's competition. It was held close to 5:00 p.m., and the temperature had dropped to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Fortunately, the water temperature remained around 76 degrees after being exposed to the sun. A total of seven people participated in the competition. Huang Changbei from Indonesian Chinese gave up due to illness. Wu Chuanyu from Indonesian Chinese, who had the best results in the preliminary and semi-finals, was the strongest. Liu Dibing from Hong Kong participated in the 1500-meter freestyle semi-final in the morning. Although he won the first place in the first group, his strength was inevitably dispersed, but he still had the determination to fight. In this competition, Wu Chuanyu and Yu Shundao from Indonesian Chinese occupied the two outer lanes, and Di Bing was in the middle. As soon as the gun sounded, Chuanyu and Shundao entered the water the fastest. The rest were almost indistinguishable, fighting for this moment of time. All that could be seen was that on the seven lanes, seven Hun Jianglongs were turning up white waves, and water splashed everywhere. After turning around at 50 meters, Chuanyu took the lead step by step, and Dibing followed closely. Feng Zhaoyu from Malaysia refused to fall behind and caught up head-on. The rest of the participants kept waving their hands and fighting to the end. As a result, Chuanyu still defeated Dibing by a margin of two meters and reached the finish line first, with a time of 1 minute 3.3 seconds, which was equal to his best record in the semi-finals, shortening the national record by 2.4 seconds. Some people said that Dibing and Chuanyu were not far apart, and the result should also break the national record. However, only one timer recorded the time, and the time recorded could not be officially recognized.

### Women's 200-Meter Relay Swim: Hong Kong Mermaids Achieve Excellent Results, Breaking National Record with 2 Minutes 35.6 Seconds

Only the Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Shanghai teams participated in the women's 200-meter relay race, which was temporarily changed to the final. The Hong Kong mermaids Huang Wanzhen, Huang Wansheng, Zeng Fengqun, and Gao Miaoling were all dispatched, and the championship was "certain." Everyone wanted to see to what extent the national record would be broken. The first swimmer, Huang Wanzhen, entered the water first as the gun fired, and was already six meters ahead after swimming 50 meters. The second swimmer, Wansheng, continued to work hard, and was more than ten meters ahead after 100 meters. The third swimmer, Zeng Fengqun, and the fourth swimmer, Gao, each used their best skills to sprint to the end, with a time of 2 minutes 35.6 seconds, breaking the national record, shortening the time by 3.2 seconds. They left the Taiwan girls behind by as much as 40 meters. All of the Hong Kong mermaids used freestyle from beginning to end, neat and beautiful. The Taiwan girls were all dark-skinned. They looked strong and sturdy, and could not help but pale in comparison to the Hong Kong mermaids. But compared to the Shanghai ladies, their strength was still a cut above, and they finally snatched the runner-up. Yesterday, the Shanghai team swam with a spectacular style. The first swimmer, You Huixia, swam freestyle, and the second swimmer, Zhang Xingyan, swam backstroke. When she was about to reach the pool wall, she was afraid of hitting her head, so she stopped two meters away from the pool and paddled to the edge of the pool. The third swimmer, Huang Zongying, also swam backstroke, and the fourth swimmer, Liu Tian, swam breaststroke. The entire course was all-encompassing, and the style was extremely free and easy. They finally made it to the end. Anyway, the third place was uncontested. Compared to the first place, they were lagging behind by 80 or 90 meters.

Men's 400-Meter Heat: Divided into two groups, the top four from each group advanced. It was already close to dusk, and each group had only five participants competing. After entering the water in the first group, Philippine Zhuang Meidao took the lead first, leading all the way. At 100 meters, he briefly competed with Hong Kong's You Shikun, but at 200 meters, Zhuang had already taken the advantage and finally led to the end, leaving the second-place Hong Kong's Huang Jinhua behind by ten meters, with a time of 6 minutes 4.6 seconds. The second group was again the world of Hong Kong's Chen Zhennan, with no one competing with him, completing the entire course in 5 minutes 50.7 seconds. Liu Dibing fought continuously, exhausted, and finished fourth, almost being eliminated.

### All Football Referees Resign Again

[Our Report] The Shanghai football referees decided last night to submit their resignations to the National Games Referees Group. They have decided not to referee the last two days, today and tomorrow. According to the referees, disputes have repeatedly occurred on the football field, and there is no guarantee for the safety of the referees. They submitted their resignations to Hao Gengsheng, the secretary-general of the conference, the night before last. After Secretary-General Hao's earnest retention, Commander Xuan of the security police also expressed his willingness to be responsible for ensuring safety. Only then did they dispel their intention to resign and reluctantly do their best.

At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, in the football elimination match between Hubei and Nanjing, the referee was Zhu Quan. Nanjing took the lead with a score of 1-0, and there was still one and a half minutes left, and the situation was quite tense. When the Hubei team attacked, the referee Zhu Quan ruled it offside, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the Hubei team. The captain immediately stepped forward to question Zhu Quan. According to Zhu Quan, at that time, a Hubei team player, number 12, punched him three times, and the momentum was very fierce. Zhu suppressed his anger and blew the whistle to end the match, and then reported the process to the referees group. The Shanghai referees believe that in this environment where there is no sportsmanship, lack of athlete spirit, and referees have no safety guarantee, they have no choice but to stop performing their duties and submit their resignations to the conference.

### A World of Fish-like Joy: The Zheng Sisters, Self-Taught and Making a Stunning Debut, Realize Their Aspirations, and Their Cherished Talents Bring Smiles

— Our Newspaper Reporter Hong Xucai

[Special Report from our Newspaper] Among the "new mermaids" produced this year, in addition to the Huang sisters from Hong Kong, there are also the Zheng sisters from Guangzhou, who have just begun to show their talent in this National Games but have already made a stunning debut.

Zheng Yanying is fourteen years old, and Zheng Xueying is thirteen years old, but the younger sister is taller and more robust than the older sister. They have only been swimming for a year, but they have achieved such amazing results, which makes people have to believe that this is a gift.

Playing by the Small River at the Door

Last year, the Zheng sisters were students in the second year of junior high school at Tianjin Cihui Middle School. They speak good Mandarin. The reporter asked them, "Who taught you to swim?" They shook their heads and replied, "No one taught us. There is a small river at the entrance of our village. We saw people swimming well, so we followed them and paddled around, and gradually we learned how to do it."

Five days last year, their father took them to join the Guangzhou swimming team. The instructor, Su Damo, believed that they were indeed talented and carefully trained them. Coincidentally, last year the Zheng sisters missed the start of the school year because their family moved to the countryside in Nanhai, Guangdong, so they temporarily stopped attending school. This created an opportunity for them to practice swimming fully.

Every morning at 8:00 AM, their father personally accompanied his two daughters, taking a sampan to the Guangzhou swimming team for practice, returning home at 5:00 PM. Although the round trip took four hours, they never stopped. Over the past year, their performance has improved rapidly, and their speed is astonishing.

Audience Goes Crazy at First Sight

Yanying specializes in backstroke, and Xueying swims breaststroke, each with their own strengths. On the first day of the swimming competition, Xueying participated in the preliminary round of the 200-meter breaststroke and won second place. Yesterday, Yanying participated in the preliminary round of the 100-meter backstroke and won first place. Among the swimmers, they were the youngest and shortest, but when they jumped into the water, their movements were agile and their postures were beautiful. For a time, the audience's applause and cheers were almost frantic. The fourteen-year-old Yanying was surrounded by adults taking photos and asking for autographs as soon as she got out of the water. Her trembling little hand wrote very well!

Such amazing achievements for young girls of thirteen or fourteen are truly rare talents. It is believed that if they are given time, they will surely shine in the sports world!

Winning the Championship is a Double Blessing

Since winning the championship, the new mermaids Huang Wanzhen and Huang Wansheng have been extremely proud and always smiling. Wanzhen is especially excited and happy. It turns out that Wanzhen has therefore obtained the opportunity to study in the United States. Yesterday, the Huang sisters' mother told reporters: Wanzhen loves music and is determined to study in the United States. As for her father, he insisted on sending his daughter to England, so the father and daughter could not agree. Because Wanzhen kept pestering him, the father made a wish: "If you participate in the National Games this time and can break the national record, then I will agree to you going to the United States." Now that Wanzhen has succeeded and returned with a triumphant song, the realization of her ideal is just around the corner.

Mom and Dad are Both Good

After receiving the good news of Wanzhen's success, her father sent a congratulatory telegram. He had already planned her itinerary. This autumn, he plans to take Wanzhen to England first to let her see the London World Games, and then send her to the United States to study.

Wanzhen's mother said: Although her daughter broke the national record, this result is not ideal. She will continue to have the Huang sisters practice hard and will never allow any arrogance or complacency. Let us look forward to the more brilliant light of this lucky pair!

### Men's Tennis Doubles Long and Arduous Battle: Police Team Wins Over Indonesia, Hong Kong Team Defeats Malaysia. The Indecisive and Fiercely Contested Match with Thrilling Scenes Left the Audience Restless.

[Report from our newspaper] The finals of the men's and women's tennis championships, Xu Weipei (Hong Kong) forfeited to Ye Guanxiong (Guangzhou) in the men's singles yesterday morning, and Wang Wenzheng (Police) forfeited to Tao Guanqiu (Police). Therefore, the focus of the tennis court shifted to the men's doubles round-robin final in the afternoon. Exhausting finals, endless rounds, a player has to hold a singles final in the morning and a doubles final in the afternoon, with limited energy, it is difficult to cope, so Xu Weipei Wang Wenzheng's abandonment of singles, to fully cope with doubles, is a smart way.

In the men's doubles final, Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng fought a five-set battle, defeating Indonesian players Chen Lichao and Li Wenxuan. The fierce battle lasted for three hours, with wonderful performances and thrilling moments. The division of victory and defeat was often at stake. Hundreds of spectators were restless. Chen Lichao and Li Wenxuan could have won but did not. Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng came from behind. This game was undoubtedly a major and exciting program yesterday. In another game, the Xu brothers Weipei and Runpei of Hong Kong defeated Malaysian players Xie Roberlin and Shan Zhen in four sets, winning three to one relatively easily. The doubles champion will be decided in a battle between Tao Wang and the two Xus. The results of yesterday's men's singles and doubles round-robin finals are listed below:

Men's Singles Round-Robin

Ye Guanxiong (Guangzhou) wins against Xu Weipei (Hong Kong) Xu forfeits

Tao Guanqiu (Police) wins against Wang Wenzheng (Police) Wang forfeits

Men's Doubles Round-Robin

Li Wenxuan and Chen Lichao Fall Short

The Tao Wang and Chen Li teams can be said to be evenly matched. Chen Lichao and Tao Guanqiu are of course the best, and their performances are also good. Smashing, blocking, and wonderful shots appear frequently. If Li Wenxuan's young experience was not enough, and he lost his temper, and accumulated touches on the net, Chen Lichao's team would have won long ago. Tao Guanqiu is also like this, Wang Wenzheng is exhausted, cannot run, and repeatedly touches the net to lose points, otherwise Tao Guanqiu's team would have won long ago. Tao Wang relied entirely on experience and seniority, and in the midst of difficult situations, sometimes outstanding shots emerged, opening up new paths. Chen Lichao powerfully counters, attacking Tao Guanqiu's backhand, Tao actually yielded to it, but unfortunately Li Wenxuan's combination was too weak and fell short, which was a pity for hundreds of spectators.

The first set was immediately stalemated, the Indonesian team scored three consecutive games, the police team also returned four games, the Indonesian team won two games, and took the lead again with five to four. Tao Wang tied at five, then scored two games, and it was already difficult to determine the victory or defeat in the first set with seven to five. After a set of battle, Wang Wenzheng was already showing signs of weakness, so in the second and third sets, Indonesians Chen Lichao and Li Wenxuan exerted pressure and easily won two sets with six to three and six to four, coming from behind with two to one. The general audience thought that the trend of victory and defeat had been divided, and there would be no problem. Unexpectedly, after a break and a restart, Chen Li took the lead with three to two in the fourth set. Because of Li Wenxuan's mistakes, he lost three consecutive games and pulled back a game, becoming four to five. In the tenth game, Chen Li presented a valuable "game point". Four to six, tying at two sets each. In the fifth set, Chen Li's momentum rose and took the lead with five to three. In the decisive game, after repeated "equal", the Chen Li team lightly lost one point of "set point" and "winning point" that determined the victory or defeat. In the audience, it was a sigh for those who could win but did not. Five to five, six to six, seven to five, and the police team Tao Wang finally won the final victory.

Xie and Lin Are Brave and Messy, the Two Xus Qin Kai

In the battle between the two Xus and Malaysia's Xie and Lin, Xie and Lin were brave and messy, blocking and smashing, and the ball was not grasped, and weakness could not win. Insufficient defense, let alone aggressive. After losing two sets with six to four, six to four, the Xu brothers were careless, and the two Malaysian players won back a set with eight to six. In the fourth set, the Xu brothers won again with six to two.

Women's Singles Round-Robin

Women's Doubles Round-Robin

Two Women's Singles Games: One Relaxed, One Intense

Yang Weibin won against Lu Yuanchun in the women's singles, extremely easily. In the first set, she won four consecutive games, and after losing two games, she won two more games. In the second set, Yang won six consecutive games to win a shutout. Yang Weibin is sure to win the women's singles championship.

Chen Jinshi took the stage and defeated Zhu Zhiying 6-1 in the first set with powerful long shots. In the second set, Zhu targeted Chen Jinshi's weakness of being bad at running, and attacked with long shots and short cuts, sometimes far and sometimes near. As expected, she pulled back a set 6-4. Zhu Zhiying won the first game in the third set, but unfortunately she could not calm down and was eventually defeated. However, Zhu Zhiying's performance yesterday was indeed quite wonderful and had exhausted all her energy.

The strength of the two women's doubles finals is very different, and the situation has become a competition for the championship.

### Women's Basketball Round-Robin: Shanghai Sure to Win Today, Indonesia Defeats Fujian Yesterday, Second, Third, and Fourth Place Awaiting Replay

[Report from our newspaper] The fifth act of the women's basketball round-robin, Indonesia met Fujian, which started at 2:00 PM yesterday in the gymnasium. In the round-robin, Fujian had a record of one win and one loss, while Indonesia had two losses in two games, but according to outdoor performances, Indonesia was originally a very strong team. After days of repeated competitions on the floor, they gradually became accustomed. The team took advantage of the speed of passing to win, and the overall connection was also more obvious than that of the opponent. Fujian has always been behind, only relying on Ju Cai, the two veterans' excellent shooting, to maintain a close score.

Yu Ying's Slanting Shot Finds the Net

When the two teams made contact, the Indonesian team launched a frontal attack. Xiuli scored first, and Xixi broke into the defense and pushed in a ball, tying at two each. Xiuli scored again, Jin Song fouled, and Xixi made both free throws, making it four to four. Xiuli performed brilliantly, waving and scoring, and Yu Ying broke the net with a slanting shot from the right corner. Fujian only scored one point from Lixiang's free throw, and Indonesia took the lead with eight to five in the first quarter.

Ju Cai Scores Three Consecutive Points

In the second quarter, Fujian's Lin Zhihui replaced Chen Lixiang, and Indonesia also replaced Guixin with Suqing. Huang Guiying fouled, and Suqing missed the free throw. Xiuli was tall and lurked under the basket, taking advantage of the opportunity to catch the ball and push it in. Ju Cai was angry and scored three consecutive points with the penalty, and Zhihui scored, ten to ten, Fujian tied the score.

Lin Tuniang took the stage, and Chen Lanying retired. Suqing scored two consecutive goals, and Xixi broke into the basket and scored, and Xingniang fouled. Ju Cai scored one point from the free throw, fourteen to thirteen, the situation was tense, Xiuli threw it in under the basket, and Ju Cai also scored a goal, sixteen to fifteen, Yu Ying re-entered the game and transferred Suqing down, Xiuli scored again, nineteen to sixteen in the second quarter, Fujian was still at a disadvantage.

Xiuli Scores Under the Basket

In the third quarter, Fujian's He Ruiqing transferred out Huang Guiying, and Indonesia's Guixin re-entered and replaced Suqing. Guixin stood and scored in the left corner, and Xiuli scored again under the basket, twenty-five to sixteen. He Ruiqing fought barefoot, Ju Cai threw and made two penalties, chasing to twenty-six to twenty. Yu Ying broke the basket twice, and Ju Cai scored a near-basket shot, thirty to twenty-two, ending the third quarter.

Xingniang Fouls Five Times

In the last quarter, Suqing was transferred out again, and Guixin was replaced. Fujian's Huang Guiying also replaced He Ruiqing, and Chen Lixiang also fought barefoot. Xiuli pushed in, and Xixi responded with a long shot. Indonesia's Li Xingniang fouled five times and was penalized. Chen Lanying took over, and Xixi scored a free throw and then scored another goal, thirty-two to twenty-seven. There were still four minutes left. Xue'e pulled her hand, Xiuli scored a free throw, Xu Xixi and Lin Tuniang double-fouled, both failed to make free throws, Xixi dribbled the ball alone to the basket and scored, and fought to thirty-five to thirty. Xiuli received a pass under the basket and jumped up and pushed it in, thirty-seven to thirty.

Suqing Scores a Goal

Indonesia switched to passing to consume time, Xixi threw and scored, and Suqing turned around and threw in a ball. Ju Cai fouled, Xiuli scored a point from the penalty, Lanying fouled, Xixi scored a free throw, and finished with forty to thirty-three. Indonesia won for the first time, with the same points as Fujian.

If Shanghai wins against the Philippines today, then Indonesia, the Philippines, and Fujian will each have two losses and one win, and the second, third, and fourth places will have to be decided again. If the Philippines team wins, then Shanghai and the Philippines will decide the champion and runner-up, and Indonesia and Fujian will decide the third and fourth places. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:

### Shanghai Should Win Against Philippines in Today's Women's Basketball Championship

— Our Newspaper Reporter Qian Changnian

[Special Report from our Newspaper] Today's women's basketball championship, Shanghai vs. the Philippines, will be held at 2:00 PM in the gymnasium. If the Shanghai team can win, it will be crowned as the basketball queen. Although the Philippines team has lost to Fujian once, if it can beat Shanghai today, it will still have a glimmer of hope for the championship.

I think that no matter in terms of psychological conditions, state, or even the use of tactics, the Shanghai team has more favorable conditions.

In terms of psychological conditions, the Philippines team can only win and cannot lose, and they lack experience - the battle against Fujian was a defeat for this reason. Shanghai's Huang Mingyuan and others are veterans who have been in the basketball world for many years and are better able to use their brains calmly. What's more, Shanghai has a fierce front line to give a warning, which can put the Philippines in a state of panic and weaken their combat power.

Secondly, in terms of state, the current Shanghai team deserves the title of being sharp in attack and solid in defense. Forwards Shi Zonglan and Huang Mingyuan both have the superb skills of dribbling deep into the enemy's basket and scoring with one hand. The shooting rate of the three forwards is also stable at an extremely high level. The guards have a tacit understanding of alternating marking, with few loopholes, and they have sufficient stamina. Zhu Jinyun is particularly outstanding. It can be assumed that she can take on the role of locking down Yang Xiuzhi, the key to the Philippines team's scoring. This can reduce the Philippines team's score.

The Philippines team's defense is not impenetrable, and the three forwards of the Shanghai team all have the possibility of scoring average points. Shi Zonglan's free throws are too unfamiliar, but fortunately, the relationship is subtle and will not affect the overall situation.

In terms of the use of tactics, the Shanghai team may wish to divide the forwards and guards into two combat organizations. The guards are responsible for restricting the activities of the Philippines team's forwards, especially Yang Xiuzhi, and must fully mark them. The forwards are responsible for scoring points. If the Philippines wants to win, unless the Shanghai team's guards cannot stop the activity of the Philippines team's forwards, resulting in a situation where the gains do not outweigh the losses, and they lose by a small margin. In fact, this possibility is extremely small. We place our expectations and trust in the Shanghai team's defense.

### Zhejiang Wrestler Shi Pingui Dies of Illness, Our Newspaper Collects Funds to Donate to His Family, Hoping that the Audience Will Actively Contribute

### Women's Volleyball Two Championship Matches: Taiwan Defeats Hunan, Shanghai Crushes Guangzhou; Yang Yu'er's Serve Wins Cheers from the Entire Audience; Shanghai Defeats Guangzhou with Utter Ease

[Our Report] The women's volleyball round-robin matches between Taiwan and Hunan, and Shanghai and Guangzhou, continued yesterday afternoon at the City Sports Field. As a result, Taiwan defeated Hunan with a score of 2-1, while Shanghai overwhelmed Guangzhou in straight sets.

In the first game, both sides had their strategic gains and losses, but Hunan was slightly better than Taiwan. This key was Zheng Peikun (left front row), the soul of the Hunan team. Her quick attacks and fast spikes caused Taiwan to lose the first set.

At the start of the second set, the very first ball ignited a fierce battle. After a prolonged struggle, Hunan, not good at long battles, lost the first point. After that, the left wing of Hunan's front row repeatedly lost ground, and Taiwan's right second row launched a large-scale offensive, continuously spiking, and finally Taiwan won back a set with a score of 21-10.

In the third set, both sides repeatedly tied, their skills making it difficult to distinguish their levels. For example, Taiwan had Yang Yu'er's spikes, while Hunan responded with Zheng Peikun's fast attacks. Although the Hunan team's serves were good, Chen Huaguang, the left-handed pitcher from Taiwan, was also not bad. After an eight-point tie, the Hunan team gained points through serves, gradually taking the lead.

Taiwan became chaotic due to rotation. When the score was 8 (Taiwan) to 11 (Hunan), the two generals of the left and right wings of the third row actually overlapped, losing the ball due to scrambling. Fortunately, when Yang Yu'er rotated to serve at 11-14, she displayed great power, scoring six points in a row, shocking the Hunan team and cheering the audience. In the end, Taiwan won the third set and returned in triumph. The battle conditions of the two games are recorded separately as follows:

Taiwan: Luo, Ni, Yang Yu'er, Gao Jingya, Chen Jinxi, Jiang Guizhi, Zhang Yuese, Yan Xiuying, Chen Meiyu, Chen Huaguang

Hunan: Zheng Peiji, Qin Benze, Chen Chunxiu, Liu Xingheng, Zeng Yuyuan, Liao Zhiqiang, Zheng Peikun, Liu Yunshan, Liu Zhulan

The match between Shanghai and Guangzhou was, in fact, the battle for the third and fourth places in the championship. The strength disparity was too great, and the battle was lackluster. At the beginning of the first set, the Shanghai team served, winning 15 points in a row, breaking the record of any volleyball game in this competition. As a result, the Shanghai team won the first set 21-4. By the second set, the Shanghai team won so effortlessly that they inevitably underestimated the enemy, so they were once tied by the other side, but in the end they still won another set with a score of 21-9, securing victory.

Men's Volleyball Losers' Match: Jilin Defeats Zhejiang

[Our Report] The men's volleyball losers' final between Jilin and Zhejiang took place yesterday morning. After the start of the match, the two armies repeatedly tied, making it difficult to distinguish who was better, but Jilin's serving skills were quite strong, so they defeated Zhejiang with a score of 3-1. The score of each game was 20 (Jilin) to 22 (Zhejiang), 22-20, 21-12.

### Men's Softball Losers' Match: Fujian Team Demonstrates Divine Power

[Our Report] The second week of the men's softball losers' match took place yesterday morning in Yiyuan. The Navy team only played five innings and easily defeated Henan with a score of 11-5. In another match, the Fujian team, which unfortunately lost to the Police team by one point in the first battle, demonstrated great power, fiercely attacking the United Logistics team, with a score of 21-0, creating the record for the most points scored in a softball match in this competition. They will compete with the Navy team tomorrow (16th) for the losers' championship. The Fujian team has many good players from St. John's University in the city, and should be able to win.

### Baseball Exhibition Match: Taiwan Wins Championship, Hard-Fought Victory Over Shanghai by 3-1

[Our Report] The men's baseball exhibition match final, Taiwan vs. Shanghai, was held at the Racecourse at 1:30 PM yesterday, with the famous referee Zhang Guoxun officiating. Both sides built deep trenches and high fortresses, taking every step with caution, and President Zhang Chaogui's excellent performance as the second pitcher was also exceptional. Neither side gained anything for as many as eight innings. Taiwan relied on a bunt in the fourth inning to get on base and score three points. Although Shanghai tried their best to counterattack, they only managed to score one point in the sixth inning by Liang Youwen. After that, neither side made any further achievements, and the combined team defeated their strong enemy by 3-1, winning the baseball exhibition match championship title.

### Guangdong Has Already Securely Won the Women's Softball Championship

Yesterday, they also defeated the Beijing team by 8-5

Gansu's Daughters Have the Same Spirit

[Our Report] Two women's softball matches were held yesterday morning at the General Assembly Athletics Field. In the first battle, Shanghai vs. Gansu, the Shanghai team was stronger, taking the lead at every turn. By the fourth inning, when they were leading by ten points, they thought they had victory in their grasp, and hastily replaced six starting players, so that other players would have the opportunity to play. The original intention should not be criticized. Unexpectedly, Gansu suddenly rose up and strengthened their efforts, taking advantage of the Shanghai team's slight arrogance and unstable formation, launching an attack, creating a bases-loaded situation twice. In the last three innings, the Shanghai team made frequent mistakes, and were forced to a 17-17 tie. Finally, thanks to Cheng Mulan hitting a point, they were able to avoid tying with Gansu. The generals of Gansu, although they don't have any special skills in the art of playing, their fighting spirit has always been the same, which is enough for each team to follow; if their skills are further honed, it will not be difficult to become a strong traveling team.

In the second battle, Guangdong continued their consistent style, defeating Nanjing by 8-5. The Guangdong team only has one battle left this morning against Gansu, which they should easily win, securing the long-term championship, and the softball championship has already become theirs.

### The People of Shanghai Are in for a Treat: One Feather in Wangu Yunxiao; Watching a Tiny Ball Game in the Large Gymnasium

[Our Report] The badminton exhibition match started at 7:00 PM last night at the City Gymnasium. Originally scheduled for eleven matches, only eight matches were held due to the absence of Guizhou players, with an additional Malaysia-China doubles performance. The Malaysia-China team, with the power of thunder, defeated all Hong Kong and Shanghai men's, women's, singles, doubles, and mixed players in an overwhelming manner, refreshing the eyes and ears of the Shanghai badminton community. It can be said to be the biggest win in this competition's exhibition match.

Malaysia-China's Playing Skills Are Excellent

In the two men's singles matches, Hong Dequan and Zheng Kunlin (Hong Kong team captain), who dominate Hong Kong and Shanghai, were defeated by Malaysia-China's Huang Bingxuan and Huang Defu respectively. The two Malaysia-China players are as still as a mountain, and as moving as a flowing river. Their hitting style is light and fast, coming and going unpredictably. They appear in front and suddenly are behind, causing Hong and Zheng to run around constantly, leaving them with no choice but to surrender. This is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai badminton.

Wonderful Performances: A Double Performance Was Added at the Last Minute; Two Huangs Collaborated to Battle Malaysia-China's Yang Decai and Huang Baolin; The Playing Skills of Both Sides Reached Their Peak; They Fought with All Their Might, So the Battle Was Thrilling; The Cheers from the Audience Never Stopped, Truly Creating a New Era for China's Badminton World. The Malaysia-China women's generals also completed their victories with ease. The results of last night's matches are as follows:

Men's Singles

Women's Singles

Women's Doubles

Mixed Doubles

### From the Diving Board to the Poolside

— Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong

Army Major General Performs Diving; "Flying Legs" Famous for Backstroke

[Our Special Report] With the swimming scores repeatedly breaking records, the number of spectators by the swimming pool is also creating new records. Although the gate at the entrance is heavily guarded, all kinds of miscellaneous people have their own ways of getting in. Especially during the diving performance, the sides of the diving board are crowded with people, so the command platform had to announce a suspension and ask the military police to clear the idlers in the vicinity, so the diving performance, which was originally scheduled to start at 2:10 PM, was not able to continue until 3:10 PM.

During the stalemate, the reporter's loud voice broadcast from the microphone: "The referee cannot work, the performance cannot be held, please clear the spectators on the right side of the diving board." At this time, some people in the stands applauded, some booed loudly, and others cheered strangely.

Several non-diving athletes sat on another diving board suspended in mid-air next to them to watch, high above, very comfortable, but unexpectedly blocked the view of the spectators in the stands behind, and they were unanimously booed down. The results of the diving performance were not outstanding, and the lack of a mermaid to participate failed to satisfy the audience's expectations. In addition, both water polo performances were temporarily abandoned. When the meeting was dismissed, a gentleman was heard sighing: "Unlucky! I spent 400,000 just to bask in the sun for a day."

The quality of the posture is judged by three referees. Each person prepares six long-handled wooden boards painted with numbers one to six. After each performance, they each hold up one board to indicate the score they gave. However, the opinions of the three referees are very inconsistent. Once, two of them each rated two points, but the other rated five points, and the audience laughed.

Army athlete Deng Molin, who participated in the performance, is a major general, and the reporter gave him a solemn introduction.

The first place in the men's 100-meter backstroke semi-final, Feng Zhaoyu from Malaysia, has all the hair below his thighs, and can be called "Flying Legs" in the true sense of the word.

The Hong Kong team broke the national record in the women's 200-meter relay race. The mother of the Huang sisters walked over with a smile to tell her girlfriend: "It broke the record again."

The Huang sisters, Gao, Ling, and Zeng Fengqun, the four relay race champions, were surrounded by photographers and autograph seekers after getting out of the water, and they were unable to cope. Just when they were embarrassed, the Hong Kong team leader "killed" into the crowd and escorted them out of the encirclement.

After a kind man asked them to sign the "brim" of his sports cap, he bragged to his friend: "This hat is full of fragrant names from the countries of women." He was very proud of himself.

Someone in the stands wriggled out of the railing and wanted to climb down. The command platform immediately stopped them loudly. The reporter first said: "People in the stands, don't jump down", and then added humorously in Sichuan dialect: "It's really not allowed!" The audience responded with laughter.

### Authorities Take Effective Measures to Lower Prices by About 20%

Commodity prices, which had been calm for more than a month, have recently fluctuated dramatically again. Most commodity prices have risen by more than 50%. Starting on the 13th, the government authorities have taken effective measures to curb the price surge and stabilize people's livelihood. The other day, the national bank had a huge shortfall of more than 1,200 billion, and decided to continue tightening the money supply. In addition to allocating materials, it also sold off a large number of materials. Rice, flour, cotton yarn, sugar, etc. continued to be sold off. Tax collection is still scheduled for today, and the amount will still be recorded. The other day, because the money supply suddenly tightened, many banks and firms did not balance their books until after 12 o'clock at night. Yesterday, commodity prices were suppressed by this, and it was announced that they had returned to a small level, averaging about 20%.

[Our Report] This time, the price surge was fierce, and the authorities decided to take powerful measures to stabilize prices. However, the person in charge said that the rumor that the bank had stopped lending was untrue. Yesterday, commodity prices had already fallen back. According to the observation of relevant people, the money supply will become even tighter in the next few days.

### The People's Relief Commission Continues to Sell Rice, and the Market Is Gradually Stabilizing; Flour, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cakes All Fall Back

Under the continuous sales of the People's Relief Commission, the rice market has shown signs of oversupply. Yesterday, the People's Relief Commission continued to sell in the North and South markets. The price of early rice sold in the South market was 5.45 million, but it sold very little, only 260 stones. The North market sold white japonica and indica rice. The price of white japonica was 5.5 million, and the price of indica was 5.3 million, with a total of 5,200 stones sold. Because of the tight money supply, the price of each commodity in free trading fell slightly, and the cargo owners sought to sell, but the sale was stagnant, and the price secretly fell by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. White japonica thin rice was 5.6 million, early rice was 5.5 million, and the arrival in the two markets was 5,970 stones.

Because the Central Trust Bureau continued to jointly sell flour with various factories, the price of various kinds of flour was reduced by 100,000 to 2 million yuan for delivery. However, because the money supply suddenly tightened, the tin price reported a small drop, and large households dumped it, the old car and soldier ships fell sharply from 2 million to 1.85 million yuan. Hongfeng Liancheng closed at 1.8 million, each falling by a huge amount of 270,000 to 300,000 yuan. Bran fell slightly by 120,000, and the factory price of wheat fell to 3 million, to 2.95 million yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Under the pressure of the tight money supply, cargo owners sold goods to realize cash, people's hearts were weak, and customers watched and did not buy. Soybeans fell sharply by 350,000 yuan. Corn and mung beans fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan each because customers did not buy them. Red sorghum fell by 200,000 yuan, and selected green transactions were sporadic. Sesame lacked a receiver and fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell sharply by 1 million to 1.2 million yuan.

The drop in edible oil was disastrous. Cargo owners took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and manufacturers also offered a lot. There was a lot of soybean oil on the market, opening at 13.5 million, and then falling to 12.5 million, a drop of 1.7 million yuan. Jiyitong raw oil also fell by 1.7 million yuan, raw rapeseed oil fell slightly by 1.5 million yuan, small car sesame oil fell by 2 million yuan, and soybean cake fell sharply by 160,000 to 170,000 yuan.

### Commercial Conditions in Various Places

Suzhou

[Our Suzhou dispatch on the 14th] Today's rice prices in Suzhou continued to rise. The market price of rough japonica rice was 5 million yuan, and the price of white rice was 5.65 million yuan. The door-to-door negotiated price was 5.75 million yuan. The above are all inferior goods, and the superior white rice has disappeared from the market.

Changsha

[Our Changsha dispatch on the 13th] Changsha rice prices soared, rising by more than 2 million yuan in two weeks. The price of superior rice has broken the 4 million mark. Hengyang and Xiangtan are even higher than Changsha. Hunan is a rice-producing area, and the soaring price of grain is a hidden worry.

### Taiwan Sugar Falls into the Allocated Price

Because the money supply was tight yesterday, the trend of the sugar market softened. The association divided the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar into 9.45 million yuan at first, then 300,000 yuan less, and 350,000 yuan less. The price of four-and-a-half white sugar was still flat due to the scarcity of goods, remaining at 11.5 million yuan. The price of 20 medium sand white sugar fell from 9.12 million yuan to 8.9 million yuan. Special allocation of coarse white sugar was delivered immediately at 8.9 million yuan to 6.6 million yuan, already falling into the allocated price.

The exchange of warehouse receipts was also lower than the allocated price. The 20th period coarse white sugar was delivered immediately at 8.9 million yuan in the morning and 8.75 million yuan to 6.6 million yuan in the afternoon. The exchange of delivery slips today was 9.23 million yuan in the morning, dropping to 9 million yuan, and the minimum was 8.75 million yuan in the afternoon. Next week's first period was 8.88 million yuan.

Local sugar was relatively flat. Shantou refined sugar was 6 million yuan, slightly lower by 300,000 yuan. Xinghua white sugar was 8.89 million yuan, the second was 8.5 million yuan, and 450,000 yuan less. Xinghua red sugar was 6.35 million yuan, and Qing sugar was 5.1 million yuan, slightly lower by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Hainan red sugar of high quality was 6.05 million yuan, and the second was 5.85 million yuan.

### Foreign Stocks and Consolidated Bonds All Plummet

Government bonds also fell back yesterday. Consolidated C opened at 270,000 in the morning, falling to 230,000, and then stabilized slightly. The turnover was only 4 million. Compared with the previous close, A and B fell by 28,000, Consolidated C fell by 47,000, Consolidated D fell slightly by 26,000, and Consolidated E also fell by 30,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks were prohibited from being freely carried out of the country yesterday, and the provisions have been announced. Also, due to the control of Hong Kong exchange telecommunications, the price fell a lot. Yisha opened at 4.65 million in the morning, and fell back to the 4.4 million mark before closing. Turnover was not smooth due to surveillance. Foreign firm gangs and Guangdong gangs were in, while securities gangs and money exchange firms were out. Compared with the previous close, the paper version of British-linked stocks fell by 15%, and other stocks fell by 10% each.

### Silk Prices Plunge Across the Board

The artificial silk market continued its sharp decline yesterday. The No. 120 Jin San Ma brand was offered at around 390 million yuan in the morning, but market sentiment was weak, and the price dropped to as low as 60 million yuan. The immediate price recovered to 70 million yuan at noon, and the forward price was 78 million yuan. In the afternoon, the market remained weak, opening at 72 million yuan and falling to 57 million yuan at one point. The market recovered slightly at the close, reaching 73 million yuan, still down 40 million yuan from the previous day. Factory silk also experienced a significant drop yesterday. High-quality raw silk opened at 12 bundles, priced at 520 million yuan, but the asking price dropped to the 500 million yuan level in the afternoon. D-grade was offered at 510 million yuan, but actual sales remained cautious. Furthermore, the 19th installment for allocated silk was due yesterday, and goods would soon be available, resulting in unusually quiet trading.

Silk fabrics also declined yesterday. Huaqiang Real Silk quilt covers closed in the morning with the immediate price dropping to 190 million yuan, and the forward price at 91.3 million yuan. Dachang checkered crepe fabrics were around 670,000 yuan in the morning, but the market remained sluggish in the afternoon. Other fabrics experienced drops of about 10%.

### Banking Institutions Continue to Show Inward Flow, with Dark Interest at 29%

Yesterday's clearing of bills and notes in the banking industry showed an inward flow of 92.92 billion yuan from the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury. Foreign banks also showed an inward flow of 42.05 billion yuan, leading to tight credit conditions. Among banking institutions, only the Bank of Communications showed a slight outward flow, while all others showed inward flows. The Bank of China had the largest inward flow due to receipts from yarn, cloth, and flour payments, totaling 45.85 billion yuan. The Central Bank showed an inward flow of 24.02 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications an outward flow of 5 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank an inward flow of 6.13 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau an inward flow of 10.85 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau an inward flow of 1.19 billion yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury an inward flow of 5.36 billion yuan. Large clearing houses had an outward flow of 58.16 billion yuan, and small clearing houses an outward flow of 76.8 billion yuan. The dark interest rate was 29%.

### Severe Environment, Tight Credit, Yarn and Cloth Prices Fall

Yesterday, the yarn market was effectively halted due to the authorities' investigation of yarn merchants' accounts and summons of responsible individuals on the previous afternoon and morning. Only off-market offers existed, and there was no standard market price. Buyer demand weakened, and sellers continued to sell, leading to lower asking prices. 21-count Shuangma yarn was offered as low as 220 million yuan. Later, with the China Textile Construction Corporation (CTCC) re-listing its yarn sales, offering fifteen types of coarse and fine yarns, the prices fell further. 21-count Shuangma yarn was offered at 200.8 million yuan, and 42-count Lanfeng yarn at 327 million yuan. Compared to the previous day's market, coarse and fine yarns across the board saw price drops ranging from 8.9 million to 24.5 million yuan. The cotton cloth market also suffered yesterday, as the authorities rigorously investigated yarn and cloth merchants, and the CTCC supplied large quantities of goods, leading to a sudden tightening of credit in the market. Gold notes declined, and yarn prices were lower, creating anxiety. Various parties rushed to sell. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially plummeted by 350,000 yuan. However, bargain hunters emerged, and short covering drove the price back up to 6.73 million yuan. Around 10:00 AM, merchants from Shanxi and Hankou, along with cloth merchants, raced to sell, causing a sharp drop to 6.58 million yuan, but there were few buyers. Near the close, market sentiment seemed stable, and prices rebounded to close at 6.6 million yuan, down 400,000 yuan from the previous day. Apart from 190 Shilin cloth, which remained firm, all other types of cloth experienced price declines. Ultimately, Longtou fine cloth saw even more fear, and spot offers fell to 6.5 million yuan, with sellers willing to sell at that price.

Furthermore, the CTCC's Longtou fine cloth permits were trading at a discount of 200,000 to 250,000 yuan. Sijunzi yuan bi ji was trading at a discount of 450,000 yuan, at 6.41 million yuan, with transactions occurring. Finally, it was trading at a discount of 300,000 yuan, and market sentiment appeared weak.

### Soybeans Exported in Batches to Repay Japanese Debt

[Our Report] The total amount of barter trade between China and Japan, managed by the China Trust Bureau, is estimated at around 40 million US dollars. The value of goods imported from Japan is about 25 million US dollars, while Chinese exports are only 15 million US dollars. Therefore, China has an overdraft of 10 million US dollars on the books, which needs to be balanced by exports. Recently, China shipped 2,100 tons of soybeans at a price of 172 US dollars per ton to repay the debt. In the short term, there are plans to ship 4,000 tons of soybeans and other goods from North China to Japan in batches to clear the entire debt. In the past, the Allied Economic Group had used the overdraft of this barter trade as an excuse to hinder the progress of Sino-Japanese private trade. Now, it is understood that an understanding has been reached, and the accounts of the two will be handled separately.

### Interest Rates on Treasury Bills in Five Major Cities Determined by National Bank Branches

The Central Bank has decided to simultaneously issue short-term treasury bills in major cities such as Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Nanjing. The bank has notified its five branches in Tianjin, Chongqing, and other locations to proceed accordingly. Regarding the determination of interest rates, the bank has authorized the managers of each branch to decide based on local conditions, without the need to establish a separate interest rate committee. The principal and interest on treasury bills sold in each location can only be redeemed in that location and cannot be transferred to other regions for redemption.

### Commercial Briefs

The Shanghai Camel Hair Industry Association is being reorganized by order, with Chairman Chen Youyun and others responsible for the preparations. This has now been completed, and a general meeting of members will be held on the 20th of this month at the Atlantic Restaurant on Sima Road to report on association affairs and amend the articles of association.

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhongkai and Hai ships arrived in port yesterday and the day before, respectively. They brought 4,000 tons of pig iron from Qinhuangdao, which were unloaded at Pier No. 8. Regarding the recent request from cotton merchants for the Yarn Tube Committee to increase the cotton purchase working capital fund, the committee has agreed to consider it. It is said that the key issue is the large difference between the purchase price and the market price. The date for the issuance of shares by the China Textile Construction Corporation is currently awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan's Committee on the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises. Due to the establishment of the new cabinet, it will take some time, and it is unlikely that the issuance will occur this month.

### Sharp Decline in Chinese Stocks, Slight Rebound at Closing Due to Short Covering

Chinese stocks were simultaneously plagued by both external and internal troubles yesterday, and selling pressure easily overwhelmed the market, leading to an uncontrollable decline. External stimuli were completely nullified, and market sentiment collapsed, but there was a slight rebound due to short covering at the close.

The market was weak from the start due to concerns about tight credit and unfavorable conditions. Yong Yarn opened low at 2860 yuan and retreated to 2705 yuan. It then rose to 2775 yuan, but sellers continued to flood in. Although brokerage fees were offered at 23 yuan and 27 yuan, the price still declined to 2710 yuan. No. 154 and others came in to absorb the selling, and the price recovered to 2775 yuan. No. 207, No. 65, No. 157, and No. 137 temporarily sold off, and off-market sentiment was bearish. Hong Kong Electric also fell. Near noon, the price dropped to a low of 2705 yuan, and it closed at 2730 yuan at noon. Except for Qinxing's new shares, which rose to the limit on their first day of trading, Xinyi fell by 10%, and Yong Yarn, Xinyi, Huafeng, Datong, and Jinglun fell by 5%, while the rest experienced slight declines.

In the afternoon, Yong Yarn opened slightly higher at 2780 yuan. However, a major account experienced problems with margin calls, causing panic to return, and a wave of selling soon began, driving the price down to a low of 2640 yuan. National banks showed significant inward flows, but they gradually covered their short positions, pushing the price up to 2750 yuan. No. 157, No. 197, and No. 183 sold again at 2710 yuan. No. 95, No. 22, and No. 232 held steady, and the market closed at 2725 yuan. The gains were significant, with Qinxing and Lianhua rising to the limit compared to the morning close. China Silk rose by 5%, as did Jingfu and Meiya. Rongfeng, Xinhua, Zhabei, Commerce, Jinglun, Huafeng, and Xinguang China-France rose slightly, while the rest experienced slight declines.

### Rhyme Categories in the Five Dynasties Printed Edition of the Qieyun

— Zhou Zumo

There are two extant rhyme charts from the Five Dynasties printed edition of the Qieyun: one is a fragment of a page in the collection of the Prussian Academy in Germany, containing characters from the "Han" and "Huan" rhymes of the level tone, obtained by Le Coq from Xinjiang, numbered T, L1015; the other is a set of seventeen pages obtained by Paul Pelliot from Dunhuang, which belong to this type of Qieyun, now preserved in the National Library of France. Each plate has side margins and dividing lines, and the number of plates is recorded at the end of each plate, which differs from the Song Dynasty woodblock books, which record the information in a line at the center of the plate. These seventeen pages were divided into four numbers by Pelliot: "2014," "2015," "4747," and "5531." The last page of "2014" is titled "Da Tang Kan Miu Bu Que Qieyun Yi Bu" (A Complete Qieyun of the Great Tang Dynasty with Errors Corrected and Omissions Filled), with other markings. There are nine pages of 2014, three pages of 2015, one page of 4747, and four pages of 5531. The rhyme categories preserved in each are as follows:

2014-3 Contains characters from the "Dong" and "Dong" rhymes

2014-4 Contains characters from the "Yu" and "Yu" rhymes

2014-6 Contains characters from the "Xian," "Xuan," and "Xiao" rhymes

2014-5 Contains characters from the "Xiao" rhyme

2014-8 Contains characters from the "Xiao" and "Hao" rhymes

2014-7 Contains characters from the "Qin" and "Yan" rhymes

2014-9 Contains characters from the "Zhi" rhyme

2014-2 Contains characters from the "Huan," "Shan," "Chan," and "Xian" rhymes

2014-1 Contains characters from the "Zhi" and "De" rhymes

2015-3 Contains characters from the "Dong," "Dong," and "Zhong" rhymes

2015-2 Contains characters from the "Qi," "Jia," "Jie," and "Hui" rhymes

2015-1 Contains characters from the "He," "Qia," "Xia," "Ye," and "Tie" rhymes

4747 Fragment Contains characters from the "Dong" rhyme

5531-2 Contains characters from the "Wei" and "Yu" rhymes

5531-1 Contains characters from the "Xie," "Hai," and "Hui" rhymes

5531-3 Contains characters from the "Xue," "Xue," and "Xi" rhymes

5531-4 Contains characters from the "Xi," "Mai," and "Mo" rhymes

The characters in these four numbers are quite different. After careful examination, they can be roughly divided into five types:

(1) The pages 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 of "2014" and "4747" belong to one type.

(2) Page 3 of "2015" belongs to one type.

(3) Page 4 of "2014," pages 2 of "2015," and pages 1 and 2 of "5531" belong to one type.

(4) Page 6 of "2014" and pages 3 and 4 of "5531" belong to one type.

(5) Page 1 of "2014" and page 1 of "2015" belong to one type.

The second and sixth of these six types are most easily distinguished from the rest. The first type has dense annotations and vigorous strokes, which is different from the fourth and fifth types, which have sparse annotations and soft strokes. The third type has rather clumsy characters and blunt strokes, which is the worst. Compared with the other types, it is not difficult to distinguish their merits. Since the fragment in the collection of Germany is only one page, let us leave it aside for now. However, since the seventeen pages mentioned above are relatively numerous, it is necessary to investigate whether they are all from the same book.

Let us first discuss the plate style: In the first type, page 3 of "2014" contains characters from the "Dong" and "Dong" rhymes on the upper and lower plates, and neither the beginning nor the end is complete. The upper plate is a handwritten replacement page, preserving the last eight lines, with the title "Second Plate" at the end. The lower plate is connected to the previous plate, starting with the character "Hong" in the first line and ending with the "Guai" initial, and it is woodcut, with eighteen lines. The upper part of each line from the sixth to the seventeenth is damaged. It turns out that the missing part is the fragment numbered "4747" by Pelliot, originally a leaf split into two. From the nineteenth line onward, it is again a handwritten replacement leaf, with twelve lines. Together with the previous lines, there are thirty lines in total. Page 3 of the second type, "2015," contains characters from the "Dong," "Dong," and "Zhong" rhymes, with nineteen lines, and the title "Third Plate" at the end. The characters and annotations collected on the lower plate are exactly the same as those of the previous type, so the two should be from the same book but different printed editions. The missing parts before and after can be complemented accordingly. The entire plate has thirty-four lines. In addition, in the first type, pages 2, 5, 7, and 9 of "2014" have the same plate style and characters. What remains is the end of the upper plate and the beginning of the lower plate, but the number of lines varies. The first and last parts of page 2 are incomplete in the photo, and the number of lines preserved seems to be slightly more. Without seeing the original object, it is impossible to speculate. Page 8 has fifteen lines, and it is very clear that it comes from the same plate as page 5. This is the general situation of the first and second types.

Pages 4 of the third type, "2014," and 1 and 2 of "5531" also contain the end of the upper plate and the beginning of the lower plate. However, page 2 of "2015" is a complete plate with thirty-four lines, which is the same as the number of lines per plate in the previous two types.

As for the fourth type, page 6 of "2014" only contains twenty-seven lines, while page 3 of "5531" contains thirty-four lines. Although there is some damage, it is definitely a complete plate. Page 4 of the same number only contains the last thirty lines, and the first four lines are still missing. Page 1 of the fifth type, "2014," contains the last sixteen lines of a plate, while page 1 of "2015" is a complete plate with thirty-four lines. Therefore, although the characters of these five types are different, they all have thirty-four lines per plate, which is well-known.

As for the system of these five printed editions, they are not completely the same. Roughly speaking:

(1) Page 3 of "2014," pages 2 and 3 of "2015," and page 1 of "4747" all have explanations listed before and fanqie (a type of phonetic transcription) after each initial. There are very few exceptions.

(2) Pages 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of "2014" and pages 1 and 2 of "5531" have the fanqie either before or after the explanations, which is not uniform. However, it is a common practice to have the fanqie before the explanation for the first initial of each rhyme (except for the "Chan" rhyme).

(3) In pages 1 of "2014," 1 of "2015," and pages 3 and 4 of "5531," the fanqie is always before the explanation, without exception.

Based on this, although the number of lines on the plates of these five printed editions is the same, their systems are still different and cannot be confused.

Now, let us further examine the content: The first and second types have the same line style and content for the "Dong" and "Dong" rhymes, so they should be regarded as one book, as mentioned earlier. If we combine the third and fourth types, the level tone rhyme categories that have numbers in the first type are: 2 Dong, 35 Hao, and 51 Yan. In the second type, it is: 2 Dong and 3 Zhong. In the third type, it is: 10 Yu, 13 Jia, 14 Jie, and 15 Hui. In the fourth type, it is: 31 Xuan and 32 Xiao. Based on this, we know that the rhyme system of these four types is completely consistent. The order of the level tone rhymes should be:

1 Dong, 2 Dong, 3 Zhong, 4 Jiang, 5 Zhi, 6 Zhi, 7 Zhi, 8 Wei, 9 Yu, 10 Chu, 11 Mo, 12 Qi, 13 Jia, 14 Jie, 15 Hui, 16 He, 17 Zhen, 18 Chun, 19 Zhen, 20 Wen, 21 Yin, 22 Yuan, 23 Hun, 24 Hen, 25 Han, 26 Huan, 27 Shan, 28 Shan, 29 Xian, 30 Xian, 31 Xuan, 32 Xiao, 33 Xiao, 34 Xiao, 35 Hao, 36 Ge, 37 Ge, 38 Ma, 39 Tan, 40 Tan, 41 Yang, 42 Tang, 43 Geng, 44 Geng, 45 Qing, 46 Qing, 47 You, 48 Hou, 49 You, 50 Qin, 51 Yan, 52 Tian, 53 Zheng, 54 Deng, 55 Xian, 56 Xian, 57 Yan, 58 Fan, totaling fifty-eight rhymes.

Although this is a conjecture, only in this way can we know that Xuan starts with thirty-one and Xiao starts with thirty-two in the fourth type, Hao starts with thirty-five in the first type, and Yan starts with fifty-one. Otherwise, if we say that the rhyme categories of the first and fourth types are different, with "Yi" after "Qi," no "Xuan" after "Xian," and the "Yan" rhyme also being "fifty-one," then it would not match the rhyme categories of the third type, which is unlikely. Moreover, the order of these rhyme categories from 35 Hao to 51 Yan is arranged according to the old order of the Qieyun by Lu Fayan. Although there is no concrete evidence, considering that the order of the entering tone categories in this type of rhyme book is still consistent with the old order of Fayan (see below for details), the level tone should also be based on Lu's system and not have been changed again. If this argument is not wrong, then although the printing plates of the first, second, third, and fourth types are different, the rhyme categories are undoubtedly the same.

As for the fourth type, although the systems of the level and entering tones are different, one has the Xuan rhyme in the level tone (2014-6), and the other has the Xue rhyme in the entering tone (5531-3). Xuan is the rounded-lip version of Xian, and Xue is the rounded-lip version of Xue. The classification of level and entering tones can correspond accordingly. In the Xue rhyme, under the Quan initial, there is the character "Chuan," annotated as: "Fine cloth. Also read as Zhi Quan fan." The character "Chuan" under the Quan initial of the Xuan rhyme has the same explanation and the correct pronunciation "Zhi Quan fan." This consistency is unlikely to be accidental. This probably indicates that the two printed editions belong to the same system of books.

As for the entering tone category of the fourth type and the fifth type, the systems are the same, but it is not easy to know whether they are from the same book. If we look at the number of rhyme categories, even if they are two printed editions of different books, the rhyme categories must be consistent. This is because the entering tone rhyme categories that have numbers in the fifth type are 26 Qia, 27 Xia, 28 Ye, and 29 Tie, 34 De. Before the Qia rhyme, there is also the He rhyme character, so He is 25. Before the De rhyme, there is also the Zhi rhyme character, so Zhi is 33. This numbering is only seen in the Tang Dynasty rhyme books. As for what the rhyme categories are before and after, it cannot be deduced without the fourth type of printed edition. The rhyme categories that have numbers in the fourth type are 10 Xue, 11 Xi, 22 Mai, and 23 Mo. However, before this Mai rhyme, there is also the Xi rhyme character. If Xi is 21, then the numbers for Xue and Xi do not match. If Xi is 22, then the numbers for Mai and Mo do not match. The numbers for either Xue and Xi or Mai and Mo must be wrong. Now, if we examine the third type (S.2071) of Wang's handwritten annotations and the Tang rhyme printed by Jiang Futou, the rhymes after Xi, Mai, and Mo in the entering tone are all He, Qia, Xia, Ye, Tie, Ji, , Duo, Zhi, De, Ye, Fa and other rhymes. If we follow this order, then 33 Zhi in the fifth type should be preceded by 32 Duo, 31 Yao, and 30 Ji, and 25 He should be preceded by 24 He, 23 Mo, and 22 Mai. Since the Mai and Mo rhymes are 22 and 23, the numbers for the Mai and Mo rhymes in the fourth type should not be wrong. The error is probably in the Xue and Xi rhymes. If we examine the rhyme categories above the Xue rhyme, there are not enough to make twenty. According to Sun Mian's Tang rhyme, there are only 17 rhymes from "Wu" to "Xue." If this printed edition has a "Yu" rhyme after the "Zhi" rhyme, as in the rhyme book cited by Xia Song's Guwen Sisheng Yun, then there are only 18 rhymes from Wu to Xue. The number for the Xue rhyme would only be 19, so it cannot be 20 either. This proves that there is an error in the numbers for Xue and Xi. Now, if we fix Xue as 19 and Xi as 20, then everything is consistent. Let's try to put the numbers in order as follows:

1 Wu, 2 Wo, 3 Zhu, 4 Jue, 5 Zhi, 6 Yu, 7 Shu, 8 Wu, 9 Zhi, 10 Qi, 11 Yue, 12 Mo, 13 He, 14 Mo, 15 Xia, 16 Xia, 17 Xie, 18 Xue, 19 Xue, 20 Xi, 21 Xi, 22 Mai, 23 Mo, 24 He (followed by 25 He, 26 Qia, 27 Xia, 28 Ye, 29 Tie of the fourth type. Further down are 30 Ji, 31 Yao, 32 Duo, 33 Zhi, 34 De, 35 Ye, 36 Fa—a total of 36 rhymes.)

Now that the order of the fourth type is clear, the order of the rhyme categories in the fifth type can also be obtained. By comparing the two, they can be connected. The fourth and fifth types are again a system of books.

Moreover, in the fifth type of printed edition, in the Qia rhyme, under the Qia initial, there is the character "Tao," annotated as: "Claw Tao. Also read as Ta Dao fan." If we examine the first type, page 8 of "2014," under the Dao initial of the Hao rhyme, there is exactly the character "Tao" under "Ta Dao fan," and the fanqie matches completely. Although this is a small detail, it is by no means accidental. The sound "Ta Dao" in the Hao rhyme is cut into Tu Hao fan, Xiang Ba's version and the Dunhuang version of Wang's rhyme make it Tu Gao fan, and the Song Ba version of Wang's rhyme makes it Tu Gao fan, but it is never Ta Dao. The entering fanqie of the fifth type and the level fanqie of the first type are exactly the same. The two are also books of the same type.

To summarize, these five different printed editions are not from the same book, but in terms of their content, the rhyme divisions are undoubtedly the same. Wei Jiangong mentioned this matter in his article "The Evolution of the System of Rhyme Books in the Tang and Song Dynasties" (published in the National Studies Quarterly, Volume 3, Number 1), which was written in the 20th year of the Republic of China. At that time, Pelliot's "5531" pages were not yet known, and it was not until the 25th year that Wang Yousan sent back photos from Paris, so I was able to make a copy. Last year, I received photos of Pelliot's "4747" from Wang Yousan, and after comparing and collating them, I further proved the teacher's theory, and I became more convinced that the teacher's brilliant insights were unattainable. Now, I have compared and collated the rhyme categories of the four tones of this type of rhyme book as follows: Level, Rising, and Departing Tones

1 Dong Dong Song 18 Chun Zhun Zhu 39 Tan Gan Kan

2 Dong Song 19 Zhen 40 Tan Gan

3 Zhong Zhong Yong 20 Wen Wen Wen 41 Yang Yang Yang

4 Jiang Jiang Jiang 21 Yin Yin Yin 42 Tang Dang Dang

5 Zhi Zhi 22 Yuan Ruan Yuan 43 Geng Geng Jing

6 Zhi Zhi Zhi 23 Hun Hun 44 Geng Geng Zheng

7 Zhi Zhi Zhi 24 Hen Hen Hen 45 Qing Jing Jing

8 Wei Wei Wei 25 Han Han Han 46 Qing Jiong Jing

9 Yu Yu Yu 26 Huan Huan 47 You You

10 Chu Yu 27 Shan Shan Jian 48 Hou Hou Hou

11 Mo Mu Mu 28 Shan Chan 49 You You You

Tai 29 Xian Xian 50 Qin Qin Qin

12 Qi 30 Xian Xian 51 Yan Yan

Ji 31 Xuan Xuan 52 Tian Tian

13 Jia Gua Xiao Tiao Xiao Zheng Zheng

14 Jie Hai Guai 33 Xiao Xiao Xiao 54 Deng Deng

15 Hui Dui 34 Yao Qiao Xiao 55 Xian Xian Xian

16 Hai Dai 35 Hao Hao Hao 56 Xian Kan

Fei 36 Ge Ge Jian 57 Yan Yan

17 Zhen Zhen Zhen 38 Ma Ma 58 Fan Fan Fan

Entering Tone

Wu Wo Zhu Jue Zhi Yu Shu Wu Zhi Qi Yue Mo He Mo Xia Xia Xie Xue Xue Xi Xi Mai Mo He He Qia Xia Ye Tie Ji Yao Zhi De Ye Fa

There are 58 rhymes in the level tone, 56 rhymes in the rising tone, 60 rhymes in the departing tone, and 36 rhymes in the entering tone. This is the largest number of rhyme divisions seen in the study of rhyming today. Moreover, its division into rhyme categories is the closest to the Tang Qieyun cited by Xia Song's Guwen Sisheng Yun and should be a rhyme book of the same system as the late Tang Dynasty. However, Xia Song's level tone has the Yi rhyme after the Qi rhyme and the Xuan rhyme after the Xian rhyme, with a total of 59 rhymes. This has Xuan but no Yi, so it is one rhyme short. In the entering tone, Xia Song has the Yu rhyme but no Xue rhyme, with a total of 35 rhymes. This has the Xue rhyme, so it is one rhyme more. The rhyme categories of the two have slight differences and are not completely the same. However, Xia Song's rising tone has the Xuan rhyme, while this has the Xuan and Xue rhymes in the level and entering tones, so this rising tone should also have the Xuan rhyme. Moreover, the fanqie of the rhyme categories in this printed edition, such as Yu and Yu both have Huan fan, Huan has Guan fan, Chan has Suo Jian fan, and Xian has Xian Dian fan, is different from the three versions of Wang's rhyme but the same as Xia Song's, which also proves that the two books are similar. However, the three initials Gong, Zhong, and Cong in this printed edition are all in the Dong rhyme, while the characters Gong, Zhong, etc., in Xia Song's book are in the Dun rhyme. One is based on Fayan, and the other is based on Sun Mian, and the selection of materials may have differed occasionally.

In the past, Wang Guowei once said: "The Tang Dynasty rhyme books, in terms of rhyme categories, are the same system as Lu Fayan's Qieyun, Sun Mian's Tang Yun, Xiao Xu's Shuowen Jiezi Zhuan Yunpu, and the rhyme book cited by Xia Yinggong's Guwen Sisheng Yun" (see Wang Guowei's Guantang Jilin, Volume 8, Li Zhou Qieyun Kao). That statement is correct. If we look at the divisions and combinations of rhyme classes, after Lu Fayan's Qieyun, Wang Renxu's Qieyun is in one category, Sun Mian's Tang Yun is in one category, and Xiao Xu's Shuowen Zhuan Yunpu and the rhyme book cited by Guwen Sisheng Yun, as well as this type of Five Dynasties printed edition of Qieyun, are in one category. The rhyme categories of Lu's rhyme book are based on the rhyme books of various schools of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. However, in the early stages of creation, there may have been incomplete analysis, so there have been subsequent additions since Wang Renxu. Lu's rhyme book lacks the rising and departing tones, which Wang Renxu added. Lu's book originally treated the open and closed categories of the four tones of the Zhen, Han, and Ge rhymes as one rhyme, but Sun Mian analyzed them. As it gradually evolved to this type of Five Dynasties printed edition of Qieyun, the distinctions became finer and the classifications more strict. Tracing back to its origins, it all started with Wang Renxu. Therefore, the title of this book, "Da Tang Kan Miu Bu Que Qieyun" (A Complete Qieyun of the Great Tang Dynasty with Errors Corrected and Omissions Filled), is sufficient to show its origins.

### Fundamental Problems of Indian Grammar Theory (Part 1)

— Jin Keming

The Sanskrit grammar text of the ancient Indian sage Panini, the so-called "Eight Chapters," is a remarkable book unmatched in the world, past and present. It is not only ancient, dating back more than two thousand years, but its form is also condensed into nearly four thousand algebraic formula-like verses, containing the entirety of the complex transformations of Sanskrit. Regarding the "Voice Master" mentioned in Volume 2 of the "Records of the Western Regions," and this book, which cannot be explained in a short essay and is mostly only touched upon in ordinary language books, I cannot discuss it further here. I only wish to explore the starting point of the theory upon which this grammar system of the ancestor of grammar studies in India for more than two thousand years is based. This may be of some help in understanding grammar studies and even Indian thought.

However, I must first briefly point out the characteristics of this grammar text. This can be divided into two aspects: First, it does not distinguish word classes and syntax according to semantics, but only analyzes the composition and changes of words and their connections according to morphology through sound changes. It only explains inflections (Accidence) and word formation. In addition, it includes all the "sandhi" rules of Sanskrit. Its own strictly organized grammar system is based on the observation and analysis of language phenomena, knowing only sounds. The Sanskrit word for grammar, "Vyakarana," also means analysis. Second, it focuses on the determination of the standard advanced common language (bhasa) of the time, and does not focus on the explanation of the ancient Vedic language (Chandas). It is also constrained by the habit of oral transmission through verses, so it reconstructs the results analyzed from the phenomena into a special logical system. At the same time, it follows the highest principle of brevity and conciseness and compiles a rhyme book that is difficult to reduce by even half a syllable. Readers, in addition to already understanding Sanskrit (which was not a problem at the time of writing the book), must first understand its special form, then discover its system, and then they can see that it is indeed based on long-term, meticulous analysis of language phenomena. Therefore, it has become an extremely difficult book to read, said to require twelve years of study.

Now, let me briefly describe its system: Apart from the "sandhi" rules between words, it is only an analysis of words, not of sentences. Therefore, inflection and word formation are compiled together. The nature of words is also not classified logically according to semantics, but only distinguished according to the phenomenon (sound) of morphology. Words are roughly divided into two categories: those that change and those that do not. Among those that change, the initial changes are noun endings and verb endings, and further changes are the formation of word stems that do not distinguish between nouns and verbs. The main component in this formation is the root analyzed to the end, the so-called "dhatu." What is added to the "dhatu" to make it a word, or to express all kinds of relationships such as nouns and verbs, are all "pratyayas." Here, it can be clearly seen that the "pratyaya" of a verb can be directly added to the "dhatu," while the "pratyaya" of a noun is always added after the "dhatu" has been added by another kind of "pratyaya," becoming various nouns and even adjectives, forming a compound word. It is obvious that only the root of the verb is ultimate. According to its terminology, the "pratyaya" of a verb is "tin," and verb inflection is based on "tin" as the ending, which is the old Chinese translation of "tinganta"; the "pratyaya" of nouns, adjectives, etc. is "sup," and its inflection is called "subanta." However, it originally did not care about the semantic distinction between nouns and verbs, regardless of part of speech, only distinguishing endings.

Since the analysis of words has reached the ultimate root, "dhatu," then grammar uses the "dhatu" as the basis to re-establish the rules of real language. If we talk about the analysis of phenomena, "dhatu" is the result; if we talk about the system of grammar, it is the starting point. Whether the "dhatupatha" attached to the Sanskrit grammar text, that is, the "collection of root explanations," is reliable; whether Panini's method and its results still have value from the perspective of modern people's knowledge and thought; etc., are still topics of much debate among modern European and American scholars, and cannot be discussed here. After briefly explaining the above facts, I will explore the theory about the root. As mentioned earlier, this theory is both the result of grammatical research and the starting point of the grammatical system.

### Confucianism and Chivalry

— Ji Yong

Han Feizi's "Five Moths" and "Prominent Schools" both say that in the Warring States period, Confucianism and Chivalry were the two most popular schools of thought. "Confucians disrupt the law with literature, and chivalrous individuals violate prohibitions with arms." Roughly speaking in today's words, it means those who use pens and those who use guns. At that time, the representatives of the gun-wielding class were the military strategists. Mozi advocated non-aggression, that is, specializing in redressing grievances. In order to realize his redressing of grievances, he had to accumulate his own strength in preparation for "armed mediation." Therefore, when Gongshuban was building cloud ladders for Chu to attack Song, Mozi could travel hundreds of miles with layered baggage and breathlessly run to the State of Chu to threaten the King of Chu. According to recent evidence, Mozi's disciples were organized and had a strong force, just like a religious group.

Confucianism is not like that. According to Hu Shih's research, Confucianism is synonymous with words such as "ru" (濡), "nuo" (懦), etc., meaning soaked, slow, and weak. Therefore, the inscription on the cauldron of Zheng Kao Fu has the words "bow at the first command, and stoop at the second command," fully expressing the tune of a slave. Whether this statement is true or not need not be discussed first, but it is a fact that Confucianists have always appeared in history as helpmates.

However, the emperors also looked down on Confucian scholars for this reason. Qin Shihuang did not understand political tactics well. He took that group of monsters who appeared to be Confucian scholars but acted like alchemists, brought them under Mount Li, and buried them all at once, causing a public outcry and becoming a case of eternal sin. The Han Dynasty was not like that. With Uncle Sun Tong, a descendant of the sage learning of the State of Lu, they naturally studied the psychology of intellectuals very thoroughly. Rather than killing them with a quick knife, it is better to use anesthetics. Thus, a Taixue doctoral student was enough for people like Liu Xin to fight desperately for, and a slight examination could make people like Dong Zhongshu dedicate their three years of study behind closed curtains. It is like throwing a meat bone down, and a hundred dogs wag their tails and bark and fight for it. It is truly ridiculous and pitiful. May I ask, what is the difference between the imperial examinations and fame since the Song and Yuan dynasties and this? The biggest difference is that the method is more complete and the net is more widespread.

In order to express themselves, Confucianists naturally had to eliminate "chivalry." Dong's dismissal of the Hundred Schools and honoring of Confucian scholars was a trump card. At the beginning of the Han Dynasty, there were still wandering chivalrous individuals with sincerity and courage, such as Zhu Jia and Guo Jie, who were of some help to Liu Bang's founding of the country. However, by the time of Emperor Wu, they were all eradicated. In this way, the emperor could live for ten thousand years without any worries, but the vitality of the country was also greatly weakened from then on.

Before humanity reaches the world of great harmony, it always needs a kind of opposing stability, that is to say, if there can be multiple forces in society that can check and supervise each other, it can certainly reduce many dark sides. We find novels like "Three Heroes and Five Gallants" very enjoyable, which represents the lack of these brave men who kill the poor, rob the rich, and aid the poor in society. "Water Margin" has such magic in society also because of this reason. Watching "The Pacification of Bandits" feels full of pent-up anger and makes no sense at all. Although Confucianists have seized a monopolistic position and power in society, they are often despised by the people and are not as popular as chivalrous individuals. This is because the Confucianists' own performance leads to the path of decline everywhere.

Mencius praised Tang and Wu and scolded Jie and Zhou as common men, which also has the meaning of chivalry, but the traditional view of the struggle between schools often obscures the bright side of truth, so the theories of Yang and Mo were greatly rejected. Later generations did not know how to promote their revolutionary ideas, but instead specially picked the emperor's welcome theory of respecting the monarch to chew on endlessly, which can be said to be extremely unreasonable! Accumulated brokenness will last a long time, and everywhere there are soaked and weak Confucians, and no longer see the strong and striving chivalrous individuals. The monarch and his ministers collude with each other, plus eunuchs and foreign relatives, there must be great chaos in the world and people will not be able to live. Historical facts are innumerable. It seems that Mr. Hu Hanmin once wrote an article saying that China has Confucianism but no Chivalry, which is a major shortcoming in thought. Looking at it today, doesn't it make people feel something again? The suffering of the people always needs to find an opportunity to vent. If it can be resolved sporadically, or it may not be like a mountain torrent breaking a dam, once it breaks out, it cannot be contained. This is also a way to draw firewood from under the pot. Therefore, fully developing the spirit of chivalry among the people (not the kind in "The Swordsman of Mount Emei," please don't misunderstand!), and cultivating students' sense of justice more when reading, may be a third of the way to healing a seven-year illness?

### Shi Zhaoji Resides in the United States

Reading Ling Xiaohan's "Talk Collection" in this newspaper on May 11, there was much nostalgia for Shi Zhaoji, a senior figure in the diplomatic world, saying that there was a rumor that he had returned to Daoshan (died). Recently, I received a single copy from the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development sent from the United States introducing the bank's general situation. On the page before the back cover, Shi's name is prominently listed in the list of consultants to the bank, in addition to Hoover of the United States and Sir Salter of the United Kingdom. According to reports, the Advisory Group has a total of nine consultants, elected at the Second Annual Meeting of the Bank's Board of Governors held in London in September 1947, with a term of two years. Shi is currently still serving in this position. The address of the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development is in Washington, D.C., USA, and Shi is currently residing in the United States. All those who care about Shi Weng (elderly man) can rest assured and send their blessings to Shi. (Jin Jin)

### The Sorrow of an American President

— Yu Chuang

The President of the United States is in a high position and holds great power, handling ten thousand matters every day. There is no such thing as leisure in life. When adversity comes, you cannot get rid of it, and after exhausting your efforts to deal with it in all directions, you may only attract more disputes.

The late American journalist H.H. Kohslaat had a prominent position in the political world during his lifetime and was highly respected by the Republicans at the time. Kohslaat participated in many important decisions within the party. According to Kohslaat, the President is actually something that can be done but should not be done.

One night, he went to the White House to visit President McKinley. The President said with great sadness: "For the past two weeks, I have never been able to sleep more than three hours a night. The parliament must force us to declare war on Spain. In fact, the Spanish fleet has already entered the territorial waters of Cuba in South America, and we are completely unprepared. We don't even have the ammunition to fire a salute on the Atlantic coast!"

The President said this, worried and anxious, and actually cried like a teenager!

Kohslaat silently put his hand on the President's shoulder without saying a word, but the President shed tears like a spring, unable to restrain his grief. Gradually, the President recovered. Kohslaat wanted to comfort him and said: "In this extraordinary period, any measures taken by the President will surely be supported by the whole country."

But the President did not answer. He just raised his head and asked Kohslaat: "Are my eyes red? Will others see that I have just cried?"

Kohslaat felt that it was inappropriate to continue to perfunctorily, so he had to admit that the President's eyes seemed to have a slight glint of tears.

The President said uneasily: "But I have to go to my wife right away, what should I do?" It turned out that the President's wife was hosting VIPs in the neighboring room, and many guests were present. The President should naturally also greet them.

Kohslaat came up with a plan. He advised the President to "hum" loudly before entering the neighboring room. The sound should be loud so that everyone could hear it. The effort should be sufficient so that there would be a little tear in the eyes due to "blowing the nose"! Pretend to have a cold, and everyone will not be suspicious.

Kohslaat stood quietly and watched the President solemnly stand up, walk into the neighboring room in big strides—pause slightly at the door, "hummed" loudly, and then went to greet the guests...

Sadly, President McKinley's mood was already like this at the time, but not long after this incident, he actually died at the hands of an assassin!

### Hitting and Swearing

— You Mojun

I don't know what kind of motive swearing originated from, or what its origins are. I don't know about other countries; as for our great Republic of China, it certainly existed in ancient times. In the Book of Documents, there are Gan Oath, Tang Oath, and Mu Oath. Regardless of the authenticity of these texts, one always feels a bit murderous and blustery when reading them now. Generally, they are always scolding people for being wrong and deserving to be killed and beaten! Those who are killed and beaten probably also have great articles that are grand and plausible, but due to traditional relationships, it is inconvenient to publish them, so Confucius simply deleted them to rectify people's hearts. Descending to later generations, this swearing trend gradually became popular among the people and turned into curses against the gods. After a group of heroes gather in a restaurant or a desolate temple to swear to the gods, there is always a great scene of killing well and hitting well that unfolds. Accordingly, the side effects of the word "oath" are: large-scale joint fighting, and small-scale secret punches!

According to the explanation of the word "oath," Shuowen says, "It is a restraint." The Book of Rites, Qu Li, also says, "An agreement of faith is called an oath"; the commentary says "Use words to mutually restrain each other as a basis for trust." Playing with the word "mutual," swearing is not a unilateral action. In other words, both parties must be willing to mutually restrain each other in order to obtain "trust," and only then is the oath effective. Like the oaths currently in circulation, the oath is only a one-sided, wishful thinking imposition, forcing people to obey; the object of the oath knows that not swearing is not enough to satisfy selfish desires, so they have no choice but to be perfunctory and swear randomly, making this kind of ceremonial phrase of being willing to receive the most severe punishment become children's "lip service," who is willing to follow it reverently!

Furthermore, the word "can" (餐) is composed of "zhe" (折) and "yan" (言). According to the Six Scripts Explanation, the intention of creating this word is "to use words to reduce one's crime." I don't quite understand how to reduce it. The word "zhe" is composed of "hand" and "jin" (斤). "Jin" is an axe, a tool for killing or hitting people. With a hand holding an axe, standing high above "yan," it can be proved that oaths are intended to use violence to overthrow empty words; otherwise, why put "yan" under "zhe"!

On the opening day of this National Games, there was an item in the program in which athletes took an oath. Under the watchful eyes of the public, the ceremony was quite grand. However, what followed was that the newspapers reported daily that unfortunate events such as athletes beating referees were publicly staged under the watchful eyes of the public. Didn't they all take oaths? No, they did. But why are there so many fighting incidents? After thinking about it again and again, I can only blame the word "oath" for being too strange!

### Reply to Director Zhang Wei

— Zhang Yiqu

Tilting is difficult and half-painted sky, Lan and Hu drink with certainty; Poetic heart is like two springs in a good time, waiting to nurture the grass and trees in the mountains.

Lofty and does not sink or float with the vulgar, passing by is gorgeous and allows to leave or stay; The human world has a clear distinction between the turbid and the pure, and the Kangquan River flows forever.

Occasional Feeling

Zhuzhou Huawu is a battlefield, the will of heaven and the hearts of the people are both shocked; Away from the chaos, a hundred poems express my feelings, and I remember the years of peace most clearly.

The spring breeze deliberately floats in the void, the floating world retains the floating glory; The bright peach blossoms have all passed before my eyes, and are even more lightly entrusted to the east flow.

### 

Dong Kang, an 82-year-old former Jinshi from Changzhou, was arrested after the victory because he had held a puppet position. He was then released on bail for medical treatment due to old age and illness. He passed away on the 2nd of this month. Although the case has not been concluded, it will not be pursued, because this old man's experience is considered "understandable." The authorities have deeply understood this, so he was able to escape the cage early and sleep peacefully under the window. The reason why it is understandable is that he is truly old and truly poor. He has been living alone in the old capital for many years and has long been far away from the officialdom, which is different from the situation of the Wangs and other pseudo-officials who have always been active.

Dong's style name is Shoujing, from Wujin, Changzhou Prefecture. He was a Juren in the Wuzi year of the 14th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. In the following year, Yichou, he joined the meeting list and was appreciated by the directors Li Hongzao and Pan Zuyin. They originally planned to list him at the top, but because of a small flaw, he was placed at 47th place. However, his article was still selected and engraved in ink to show his excellence. He was only twenty-three years old, a young age to have passed the imperial examinations. According to the old custom, this year's Fenli Ganza is Wuzi, which is exactly sixty years from his Xiangju, and he could have "re-banqueted the deer's cry." After becoming a Jinshi in Yichou, he was assigned to the Ministry of Justice as a chief. During the Guangyi period, he went from the "Old Ministry of Justice" to the Dali Yuan (the old Dali Temple was changed to a new system and a new name). After the founding of the Republic of China, he rotated between the Minister of Justice and the President of the Dali Yuan and became a senior figure in the legal world. Although he had many years of official experience, the legal world was more clear and cold compared to other departments. Dong had a very deep scholar's temperament. He devoted himself to the study of inscriptions and books, was keen on addiction, and was good at appraisal. He had the name of "Old Antique" and was admired by the old experts in Liulichang. Even the Japanese who prided themselves on archaeological Sinology respected him as a god. Dong once traveled to Japan and competed with antiques, earning a surplus to make up for his expenses. He lived in the West Brick Hutong next to Fayuan Temple in the south of the city. The residence was temple property, and he rented it for thirty years, living with monks and gradually becoming poor. When Song Zheyuan was the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, someone spoke for him, and he began to be assisted with 1,000 yuan to lubricate his dry rut. After the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese puppet regime organized a government, with so-called supreme three committees: "Administration," "Political Affairs," and "Judiciary." In fact, only "Administration" still had "puppet affairs" to do. "Political Affairs" was said to mean "legislation," but there was nothing to do, and it soon disappeared into thin air. It started as neither a donkey nor a horse, and then became a fox, which was very ridiculous. The "Judiciary" Committee was also large but useless, as if it existed or didn't exist. Old Dong was put on stage as a façade because of his seniority in the legal world, and he was paid a salary every month, although it was not small, but it was of the "dry repair" type.

Many old people were caught up in the whirlpool in this chaos. The Wangs were all seventy years old, while the Dongs were all eighty. In ancient times, "longevity" and "fortune" were often mentioned together. Those with high longevity were called "human Rui" (瑞, auspicious omen). However, the French Petain is ninety-two years old this year (the Western calendar must be fully calculated, which is equivalent to ninety-three years old according to the Chinese way of counting years), and the sentence of "life imprisonment" is equivalent to wishing him "eternal life." Recently, I heard that he could not stand the iron windows of the desolate fortress and applied for a retrial. Leaving aside the law and discussing life, it is also a very interesting thing.

### Idle Talk about Heroes

— Bai Chu

The hero in the Chinese consciousness is mostly a "superman." This "superman" does not refer to the hero's talent and virtue, but to his right to enjoy. A certain behavior is not allowed for ordinary people, but the Chinese hero must try it, and after the hero tries it, the management or enforcement personnel not only have no choice but to apologize to him. Who dares to break ground on Mount Tai and interfere with the hero's actions? Therefore, the hero is the one who smokes heavily in the theater; the hero is the one who can move freely while others queue up to buy tickets for the car. The Chinese concept of a hero is only this.

Heroes are naturally great. But in China, all the friends and things of a hero are great. Heroes can naturally enjoy privileges, and heroes' friends can do the same. At least, in an awkward situation, reporting the hero's name will solve all problems. We often see many people who like to say: "So-and-so treats me like this, so-and-so is someone to me," and so on. These so-called so-and-sos are the names of heroes, and those people hang them on their lips every day, or it is one way to increase their own value.
