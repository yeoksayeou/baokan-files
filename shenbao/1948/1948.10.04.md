### The Far East Marshall Plan. The US Officials have Finished the Draft. The Total Amount is Several Billion US Dollars, Targeting China, India, and the Philippines. It is Planned to Obtain Aid Funds from US Investors.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] According to the Washington Forward Times here, some members of Congress have secretly learned about the so-called Far East Marshall Plan of several billion US dollars, which has been drafted by a dozen government officials. This plan will be implemented with US funding. It is reported that the main steps of the plan are targeting China, India, and the Philippines, while Japan is not included. The current plan does not want Japan to obtain actual funds for production. The goal of the plan is to triple steel and electricity production, double cement and textile production, increase coal production by 5%, and cotton production by 25% in the East within ten years. The entire plan is quietly proceeding as a result of three economic conferences held by the United Nations in Shanghai, Baguio, and Ootacamund in the past two years. However, it is noteworthy that when the designers of the plan formally contacted the US State Department about the Far East aid plan not long ago, it is said that the State Department advised them not to think about submitting an appropriation request to Congress but indicated that American private investors and banks might be interested in the plan. The Forward Times also stated: The most annoying problem is how to obtain American assistance. Since most of the money taken from American citizens has already been promised to the European aid plan, internationalist factions in Congress are feeling distressed, fearing that the new Republican government will be indifferent to this new plan of tens of billions of US dollars used for the future of Asia. However, the designers of the plan are still hoping to obtain aid funds directly from American investors.

### Proposal to Make up for the Financial Deficit and Save Foreign Exchange. The Legislative Yuan Will Include it in the Eighth Meeting Tomorrow for Discussion.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The eighth meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 5th. The government proposals included in the agenda for reporting matters include the draft revised Organic Law of the Civil Aviation Administration submitted by the Executive Yuan for review, the Colonization Law draft, and the proposed revision of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Demobilization. In addition to the cases not discussed at the previous meeting, the newly listed discussion items include four cases: (1) The Legal Committee's report on the draft regulations for the organization of the Committee for Reviewing the Qualifications of Drafters. (2) The Social Committee's report on the review of the draft Civil Servants Insurance Law. (3) Huang Tong and others' proposal for nationalizing land, common farming, calculating capital for interest, calculating labor for remuneration, using spare capacity for work, cooperative sharing, integrating workers and farmers, and uniting society as one family. (4) Yang Baodong and others' proposal to formulate measures to make up for the financial deficit, implement savings, and reduce foreign exchange in order to stabilize the economy and strengthen the foundation of the country.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] Legislative members Yang Baodong, Yao Tingfang, and 31 others recently submitted to the Legislative Yuan a "Proposal to formulate measures to make up for the financial deficit, implement savings, and reduce foreign exchange in order to stabilize the economy and strengthen the foundation of the country," which has been included in the agenda and is scheduled to be discussed at the regular meeting on the 5th. The proposal pointed out: More than a month after the currency reform, the economy is gradually stabilizing, and prices are also stabilizing, which is a good phenomenon unprecedented since the Anti-Japanese War. However, the country's finances still face many difficulties, and the task of suppressing the rebellion has not been completed due to (1) huge military expenditures, (2) a large and costly administrative organization, and (3) the extravagance of various institutions, which are extravagant and waste public funds. Therefore, it is proposed to formulate seven points of measures to make up for the financial deficit and save foreign exchange: (1) There are too many vacancies in the army, which greatly affects combat and military discipline. It is now proposed that the government organize a military discipline inspection team, with members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan participating in the organization, to separately inspect whether their combat is diligent, whether the number of people is sufficient, and whether the discipline is strict, and report truthfully to determine rewards and punishments, and order all vacancies to be filled or all funds to be returned to the national treasury. (2) All administrative institutions that are not significantly related to the war and national construction and that are duplicative should be abolished or merged. (3) The number of personnel in each institution should not be increased beyond the pre-war number. (4) The government's income and expenditure are inconsistent, estimated at about 30% to 40%, and the government organization is layered and redundant, with many redundant personnel and reduced efficiency, so all personnel should be reduced by 30% in order to match income and expenditure. Those who are laid off should be those with weak abilities and those who have families to return to and will not cause poverty. (5) Due to the expansion of the war zone and the turmoil in the countryside, talents are concentrated in the cities, resulting in an oversupply of people in the cities, while there is a lack of talents in the local areas, and government orders are difficult to implement. All laid-off personnel should be assigned to local agencies in order to strengthen local construction. (6) Except for necessities such as food and cotton yarn, the import of other unnecessary goods such as tobacco and cosmetics should be absolutely prohibited or significantly restricted. (7) Gasoline is a major consumer of the country's foreign exchange, and officials at all levels and wealthy merchants use cars to go to entertainment venues, travel to scenic spots, and transport students. Such consumption is huge and should be strictly prohibited. Therefore, it is stipulated that during the period of suppressing the rebellion, except for the heads and deputy heads of agencies and the post, medical, police, and construction companies due to official business needs, they may use official cars and transportation cars, and the people may ride public buses. All other public and private cars in the country should not be issued licenses and prohibited from use.

### Completion of Revised Budget for the Second Half of the Year; Revenue and Expenditure Approaching Balance; No Additional Budget Needed if Prices Remain Stable

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 2nd] Following the currency reform, the revised central government ordinary and special budgets for the second half of the 37th year, using the Gold Yuan, have been drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and execution. According to reliable sources, the revised Gold Yuan budget was not simply a conversion of the original figures into Gold Yuan. Due to the implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Matters, the government's revenues and expenditures have significantly increased. The ratio of increased revenue to increased expenditure varies depending on the actual circumstances. On the revenue side, in accordance with the regulations for reorganizing finances and strengthening economic controls, government tax revenues have surged, particularly from national tobacco and alcohol taxes, income tax, salt tax, stamp tax, commodity tax, and customs duties. Stamp tax revenue in the new budget is almost thirteen times higher than in the original plan. National tobacco and alcohol taxes and income tax revenue have increased by about tenfold. Revenue from the sale of U.S. military surplus materials, lend-lease materials, enemy and puppet industry materials, and Japanese reparations materials under the special budget revenue item is calculated in U.S. dollars. Due to the increased U.S. dollar exchange rate, the revenue figures are also significantly higher. In addition, the sale of shares in state-owned enterprises, which was not included in the original budget, is now included. Based on the overall figures, the government's revenue in the revised budget for the second half of this year is estimated to be about four times the original budget. The ordinary budget's revenue and expenditure can still maintain balance, while the difference between special budget revenue and expenditure is about 20%. The government will devise other ways to compensate for this difference. U.S. aid of $400 million is not included in the above revenue items. Therefore, the deficit in the special budget can be covered with ease if U.S. aid is used effectively and expenses are reduced. On the expenditure side, for the same reasons, there has been a similar increase. The largest expenditure is the increased salaries for civil servants, teachers, and military officers and soldiers, which are about four times the original budget, in accordance with the regulations for reorganizing finances and strengthening economic controls. The operating expenses of various government agencies, after conversion to Gold Yuan, are very small and difficult to cover. Starting from September, these have also been adjusted separately, generally increasing by about 70%. Generally, the calculation standard is based on the number of employees, about ten yuan per person per month. Those exceeding this amount will be reduced, and those below will be increased. According to this calculation, it will increase by about five times. In the revised budget, the largest source of revenue for the ordinary budget is commodity tax, accounting for over 29%. Salt tax and customs duties are next, each accounting for over 17%. Income tax accounts for over 10%, stamp tax accounts for over 8%, and national tobacco and alcohol taxes account for over 5%. The largest expenditure is managed by the Ministry of National Defense, accounting for over 30%. Debt service expenditure accounts for over 18%. Finance and education expenditures each account for over 9%. Food and judicial administration expenditures each account for over 5%. The largest source of revenue for the special budget is revenue from the sale of state-owned property and materials, accounting for over 47%. Debt service revenue (part of which needs to be compensated) accounts for over 46%. The largest expenditure is managed by the Ministry of National Defense, accounting for over 67%. The Ministry of Food manages over 11%. The Ministry of Communications manages over 7%. Although the revised budget has undergone significant changes compared to the original budget, due to the sharp increase in revenue and the reduction in expenditure, the ordinary budget even has a surplus, and the deficit in the special budget has also decreased proportionally. The overall budget is closer to balance than the original plan. If prices do not fluctuate greatly during the year, this budget is expected to be executed as planned without any additional budget.

### Editorial: Appealing to World Opinion?

Starting today, the United Nations Security Council will begin to address the accusations made by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France regarding the Berlin crisis. It is reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin will all personally participate in the "public discussion" of the Berlin crisis. Although Western countries have requested the Security Council to take effective action on the Berlin issue, which has created a "threat to peace," even if the Soviet Union does not withdraw from the United Nations or refuse the Security Council to handle the matter, it will certainly exercise its "veto power," preventing the Security Council from reaching any results. Anyone with a little international knowledge knows that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France's appeal to the Security Council regarding the Berlin crisis is of no practical use. Even the diplomatic authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France understand that this move is merely a diplomatic offensive and do not hold excessive expectations.

However, from another perspective, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France's appeal to the United Nations regarding the Berlin crisis, publicly accusing the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin as an act of violence that violates the Charter and threatens world peace, marks the first time in the past three years that the United Nations Security Council has handled disputes between the five powers. This particularly demonstrates the seriousness of the Berlin crisis, which has indeed reached a point where both sides must show their cards, making its significance very significant. Especially in recent days, Paris has become the center of world politics. The news broadcast from there seems to be filled with gunpowder, making the world, less than three years after the war, seem to be on the brink of war again. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, who participated in the Moscow negotiations from beginning to end, also said: "U.S.-Soviet relations have reached a very critical state."

Ambassador Smith's words are by no means alarmist, but a warning to both sides, who are moving toward extremes. In the magnificent Palais de Chaillot, in addition to hearing Soviet representative Vyshinsky's slamming of the table and cursing of "warmongers," we also heard British Foreign Secretary Bevin's condemnation of the Soviet Union's lack of sincerity for peace. He even openly advocated regional alliances, saying: "Because we cannot expect the United Nations to operate on a world-wide basis, we must proceed on a regional basis." French Foreign Minister Schuman and Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak also echoed their support for the Western countries. This shows the tension in the emotions of the representatives of various countries, and the "appeasement policy" toward the Soviet Union is already an impossible fact. Looking at the emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the five Western European countries, they resolutely decided to establish a joint defense headquarters and appointed British Chief of the General Staff Field Marshal Montgomery as the Supreme Commander of the Five-Nation Allied Forces. Obviously, Western Europe has embarked on the road of preparing for war as a precaution. How can this not cast a shadow of war over people's hearts?

But will the Berlin crisis lead to a new war? We can only observe this issue from two aspects. From the perspective of the Soviet Union, we have ample reason to believe that the Soviet Union does not want to use the Berlin incident as the starting point for a war, but only wants to use this incident as a diplomatic tool. First, there is currently no sign that the Soviet Red Army is prepared to take extraordinary action, nor is there any indication that the Soviet Union is sending large armies and military supplies to Western Europe. Moreover, various transportation lines from the Soviet Union to Western Europe have not yet been repaired. At this time, fighting would be absolutely unfavorable to the Soviet Union. Second, if the Soviet Union wants to attack Western Europe, it must use a large number of troops and equipment. At present, the Soviet Union has not yet fully met this condition. Not only has the rearmament not been completed, but the arms industry is also inadequate. Third, according to intelligence obtained in Washington, the Soviet Union is actively preparing for war, not preparing to take the offensive, but preparing to take the defensive. Fourth, the situation within the Iron Curtain is not stable. No matter where the Soviet Union attacks Western Europe from, its rear is unsafe. The situation in Yugoslavia has already been made clear, and even Poland and Czechoslovakia are unreliable. Therefore, from any angle, the timing, location, and popular support are not suitable for the Soviet Union to wage war against the United States at this time.

Looking back at the United States, although it is also filled with calls for "preventive war," and hawks believe that atomic war is "the sooner the better," those who advocate this behavior are in the minority. Because the blood of World War II has not yet dried, most people yearn for peace. Although the United States no longer adopts a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union, which is a common and consistent position of both the Democratic and Republican parties, it will certainly not take preemptive action and challenge the Soviet Union at this time. Therefore, Secretary of State Marshall's proposal to bring the Berlin issue to the Security Council does not necessarily mean that the United Nations should take action against the Soviet Union's actions that threaten peace. In reality, it is merely a diplomatic offensive. However, whether appealing this matter to world opinion can achieve the expected results and reverse the negative trends in the world is a major test of modern civilization.

### Tianjin and Beijing Authorities Study Comprehensive Rationing of Daily Necessities; Starting with Food and Cloth to Control General Prices

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 3rd] Under the guidance of Zhang Lisheng, the Tianjin and Beijing authorities are conducting concrete studies on whether to fully implement the rationing of daily necessities. Merchants' disregard for controls has made the managing authorities feel acutely that they are facing a critical juncture. Tianjin and Beijing may start by fully rationing food and cloth to control general prices, while also promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas of Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei through the exchange of cloth for food. Although the grain price problem has been very serious recently, the reason why the authorities have not taken hasty measures is that they admit that merely treating the symptoms cannot solve the problem. A batch of grain merchants in Tianjin and Beijing have obtained loans from the national bank (2 million Gold Yuan in Tianjin City) to purchase grain in rural areas. The authorities have decided that the cloth currently available and to be produced by Tianjin Textile Mill will no longer be a target for speculation. It can have 500,000 bolts of cloth and 2,000 bales of yarn per month for civilian use in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei, and use it to exchange for raw cotton. The government will regularly control 10 million Gold Yuan as grain purchasing capital.

### Xu Kan Discusses Prices in Sichuan and Yunnan: Factors Causing Artificial Price Increases Gradually Eliminated

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Xu Kan, the Director-General of Budget, returned to Nanjing on the 2nd after completing his inspection tour of Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming a month ago. Xu met with reporters on the 3rd to discuss the implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Matters in Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, and other places, as well as providing on-site guidance. During his three-week visit, he observed that the general situation in various places was that the people were enthusiastically supporting national policies, and representatives of the people, comrades from the party, and leaders from all sectors of society were doing their best to promote and assist in the implementation. In particular, the chief military and political leaders in various places were determined to thoroughly implement the central government's orders and were striving to promote them in the face of difficulties. However, the actual situation in remote areas and vast rural areas was not the same as in urban areas. In terms of implementation techniques, some discretion had to be exercised. Every time I arrived in a place, I first investigated the actual situation in detail, listened to the opinions of all parties, and followed the central government's orders to discuss concrete and feasible measures with the local military and political leaders, and then put them into practice. Therefore, efficiency has gradually increased. Regarding the surrender and declaration of gold, silver, foreign exchange, and foreign exchange assets, after my arrival in these places, I repeatedly persuaded and urged all sectors of society to participate more enthusiastically in the exchange and declaration. In Kunming alone, as of the most recent date, the value was approximately US$15 million. The cities of Chongqing and Chengdu also had similar amounts, which shows the people's enthusiasm for loving the country. As for prices, I emphasized in various places the sufficiency of the reserve for the new currency guarantee, the strictness of the limited amount of issuance, and the government's determination to stabilize the new currency and control prices, in order to eliminate the general public's past mentality of valuing goods over currency. I also instructed the responsible authorities to strengthen management and guide idle capital into the right track, while suppressing interest rates to reduce production costs and increase production. At the same time, I investigated and prohibited hoarding, cracked down on speculation, and dredged cargo transportation, focusing on the regulation of materials, so that various factors causing artificial price increases in the past have gradually been eliminated. At present, the general situation in society has a good phenomenon, and the bumper harvest in Sichuan Province this year is a major boost to stabilizing people's hearts and stabilizing prices.

### China Branch of ECA Announces Execution of Aid to China: Rice, Flour, Cotton, Industrial Parts, Petroleum; Approved Allocation of Over US$118,950,000

[Our Dispatch] According to an announcement on the 3rd by the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), details of the progress in executing the US$275 million plan to aid the Chinese people's economy since the establishment of the branch are as follows:

A total of 105,000 tons of rice and flour have already arrived in China.

A total of 305,000 bales of cotton have already arrived in China or have been loaded for shipment.

An allocation of US$22,250,000 is planned for industrial parts.

An allocation of US$22,000,000 is planned for petroleum.

The total for the above items is US$118,950,000, including materials and supplies that require foreign exchange to purchase, thus enabling China to save on foreign exchange expenditures.

The ECA is deeply concerned about the utilization of materials and funds, and hopes to achieve maximum efficiency in utilizing resources, so as to make the greatest contribution to the economic recovery and self-help of the Chinese people. It also plans to take appropriate steps to avoid materials shipped to China from being left to rot in warehouses.

The above principles are being put into practice by the ECA in the following areas:

(1) Food: The ECA has so far spent US$20 million to purchase rice and flour, including 7,000 tons of rice shipped from Bangkok this week. All rice comes from Siam, while flour comes from the United States.

From July 1st of this year, the above-mentioned food will be used to supplement the Chinese government's grain reserves to maintain the rationing system in the six cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shantou. As of September 27th, the ECA has distributed a total of 71,645 long tons of rice. As of September 25th, the ECA has distributed a total of 10,150 long tons of flour. The remaining food that has already arrived in China is being distributed and rationed.

The ECA guarantees, through the rationing plan, that the food shipped to China is reasonably distributed to all citizens in the cities where it is rationed. At the same time, the ECA hopes to stabilize prices in the cities it assists. The ECA plans to supply 40% of the rationed rice by April 3rd of next year, with the remaining amount to be planned by the Chinese Ministry of Food.

(2) Industrial Parts: An allocation of US$22,250,000 has been planned for parts to assist the following fourteen projects: Guangdong-Hankou Railway, Beijing-Tianjin Railway, Taiwan Railway, Yangtze Power Company, Kailuan Coal Mine, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, National Resources Commission's Central China and South China Power Plants, Jibei Power Plant, Chongqing Power Plant, Hankou Power Plant, Taiwan Power Company, Beijing, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and Qingdao Power Plants, and Customs Anti-Smuggling Work.

The above projects were selected after detailed inspections by the industrial investigation team led by Mr. Stuart of the ECA, and were approved after careful examination by the Chinese and American governments and industrial experts, in order to ensure that each project can enhance China's economic self-sufficiency and the welfare of the Chinese people.

The parts plan includes materials worth hundreds of millions of dollars and large-scale economic installations. Its utilization requires a planned management system to ensure that everything is carried out according to scientific procedures. Therefore, a unique system has been created in the history of foreign aid programs to ensure the success of this plan.

Each parts plan must, with the consent of the ECA, employ an appropriate engineering company to complete the plan at the most economical cost and in the shortest possible time. The engineering company submits a service pledge to the ECA for the designated project, which must be countersigned by the executor of the application plan, guaranteeing that the plan is based on a thorough technical investigation and is expected to produce the expected results with the highest efficiency and at the lowest cost.

The pledge must be submitted to an advisory and supervisory engineering company appointed by the Chinese government for review. This advisory and supervisory engineering company is responsible for advising and supervising the joint committee for industrial construction and parts programs of the U.S. Aid Council and the ECA, and will discuss with the project engineers the methods of purchasing materials and other issues related to the various projects.

The purpose of the above procedures is to ensure that all plans are handled carefully by experienced experts.

(3) Petroleum: The ECA's plan aims to subsidize the continuous import of petroleum products to meet the essential needs of the Chinese people. If the source of these products is obstructed, China's industry and public utilities will be affected, which would suffocate the economic life of cities and surrounding villages.

The ECA has already paid US$22,000,000 for the first and second phases of petroleum allocations. This amount will be used to reimburse the Central Bank for the foreign exchange spent on subsidizing the import of 530,000 tons of petroleum between April 3rd and October 3rd of this year.

The above-mentioned US$22,000,000 includes the purchase of the following petroleum shipped to China (in metric tons):

Aviation Gasoline 23,842

Automotive Gasoline 44,868

Lubricating Oil 8,081

Engine Oil 590

Crude Oil 98,261

Kerosene 33,514

Fuel Oil 194,367

(4) Cotton: The 305,000 bales of cotton that the ECA has already shipped to China or loaded for shipment are worth a total of US$54,700,000. After twelve weeks of discussions between the ECA and the U.S. Aid Council, an agreement was reached on the method of distributing 70,000 bales of cotton to textile mills. Relevant parties deeply believe that the cotton shipped to China must benefit all the Chinese people and not be monopolized and profited from by any one part. Therefore, the U.S. Aid Council and the ECA strictly supervise every step of the process from the time the U.S. cotton leaves the warehouse until it is made into yarn and cloth and supplied to the final consumer.

The distribution of cotton is based on the total number of spindles in use in China. The recipient textile mills must meet the standards and methods of production stipulated by the Chinese government and approved by the ECA.

After extensive investigation of the manufacturing costs of various textile mills, the ECA has formulated a cotton-to-yarn/cloth ratio. Based on this ratio, the competent authorities will allocate sufficient raw cotton to the textile mills under reasonable profit conditions in exchange for the yarn or cloth produced. This exchange ratio is under strict review at all times and can be modified if necessary.

The distribution of cotton and the promotion of yarn and cloth at home and abroad are handled by the Joint Textile Management Committee. The ECA regularly sends representatives to the committee. All allocations of cotton, distribution of finished products, and revisions of exchange ratios must be approved by the ECA before implementation.

Currently, 50% of the finished products (yarn or cloth) are used for export to earn foreign exchange for purchasing raw cotton, while the remaining is for domestic consumption.

Under the tentative US$70 million cotton plan, the ECA will supply more than half of China's foreign cotton needs this year. This plan of the ECA is particularly important in assisting China's increased production and economic recovery.

### On the Eve of the Security Council's Discussion of the Berlin Incident, the Soviet Union Expresses Willingness to Reopen Negotiations; Marshal Sokolovsky Explains That Berlin is Not Actually Blockaded; Western Policy of Dividing Germany is the Main Cause of the "Crisis"

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 3rd - The Security Council will discuss the explosive Berlin issue when it meets on the 4th. At that time, representatives of all countries will brace themselves to face this serious trial. At the same time, the Political Committee will continue to deliberate on the issue of atomic energy, and the Economic Committee will begin to discuss the report of the Social and Economic Council. Therefore, next week will be one of the most tense and serious weeks of the General Assembly.

[United Press, Berlin, 2nd] Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, declared on the 2nd that the Soviet government is prepared to continue negotiations on the Berlin incident in accordance with the agreement reached with the three Western powers in Moscow on August 30th. Sokolovsky said that the "actual resolution" depends entirely on whether the United States, Britain, and France are willing to resolve it. Sokolovsky outlined the Soviet Union's position on Berlin in a white paper of more than 10,000 words. Western authorities believe that this is the prelude to the Soviet Union's justification for the Berlin issue in the Security Council meeting on Monday. Sokolovsky denounced the Western countries' policy of "dividing Germany" as the culprit of the Berlin Cold War. He particularly denounced the currency reform of the Western Allies as the immediate cause of the "so-called Berlin crisis." Sokolovsky also stressed that there is actually no blockade of Berlin, but he again suggested supplying food and coal to the residents of West Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 2nd] Marshal Sokolovsky told editors of Soviet newspapers tonight: "The Western Allies are unwilling to have an agreement on the Berlin issue. They want to use the 'Berlin crisis' to divert the world's attention from their policy of dividing Germany." Sokolovsky continued: "If the Western Allies do not want Berlin to become an outpost for attacking socialism and democracy, the Berlin issue would have been resolved long ago. At present, Berlin has become a base for the Western Allies to attack the economic and political life of the Soviet zone. The Western Allies have attempted to undermine the currency system in Berlin and have taken various other aggressive measures. The decision of the three-nation conference in London in March to divide Germany is the real cause of the 'Berlin crisis.' The Western Allies' decision to establish a divided West German government is the direct cause of the breakdown of the Allied Control Council and a major blow to the Berlin four-power administrative structure. The unilateral currency reform in West Germany in June, and the subsequent attempt to make the West German mark legal tender in Berlin, immediately triggered the so-called 'Berlin crisis.'" Sokolovsky continued: The Western Allies insist that the Soviet Union should lift traffic restrictions between Berlin and West Germany, but they are unwilling to abide by the agreement reached in Moscow, namely that the restoration of traffic should proceed in parallel with the cessation of West German mark circulation in Berlin. Sokolovsky pointed out in particular that at the breakdown of the four-power commander-in-chief talks in Germany on September 7, the Soviet authorities suggested: (1) Lifting all restrictions on railway and highway traffic; (2) Sixteen trains per day between Helmstedt and Berlin, three of which for military use. Sokolovsky concluded: In fact, there is no so-called "blockade of Berlin." Berlin residents can obtain everything from the Soviet occupation zone, including coal for winter, but due to the opposition of the Berlin City Council controlled by the Western Allies, Berlin residents cannot obtain supplies from the East Zone. In the talk, Sokolovsky also pointed out that the breakdown of the four-power commander-in-chief talks on September 7 was due to the stubbornness of General Clay, the commander-in-chief of the US Army. Participants requested four days to draft a joint report to their respective governments, but Clay did not want such a report.

### U.S. Senior Military Authorities Plan a 50-Year National Defense Plan to Address Atomic Warfare with the Soviet Union as the Target

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] U.S. senior military authorities have recently drafted a 50-year national defense plan based on the belief that the Soviet Union will be able to produce atomic bombs in 1952 and complete intercontinental atomic rockets in 1977. The leaders of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff warned on the 2nd that they believe the defense needs of the atomic age will develop in three stages over the next 50 years. They will request Congress to appropriate $15 billion for the first phase of national defense for the 1950 fiscal year.

Three-Stage Implementation

The three stages are as follows: (1) The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff expect that the Soviet Union will not have atomic bombs before 1952. During this period, the United States can develop an overwhelming atomic superiority, but cannot compete with the Soviet Union's land forces. It is estimated that the Soviet Union has more than three million armed personnel. (2) From 1952 to 1977, this will be the most severe stage, when the Soviet Union and other countries may manufacture atomic weapons and long-range strategic air forces capable of bombing American cities. (3) After 1977, in this stage, the Joint Chiefs of Staff expect that intercontinental atomic rockets, gas clouds, death rays, and other amazing weapons will appear. Military leaders believe that civilization may be destroyed during this period. The current purpose of the U.S. Chiefs of Staff plan is twofold: First, to have sufficient military power ready for immediate mobilization to support U.S. diplomacy in negotiations with the Soviet Union. Second, to build armed forces for the second stage when the Soviet Union possesses atomic bombs.

### Zhang Pengchun's Speech Supports the Declaration of Human Rights

The Soviet Union Attacks it as Reactionary

[Central News Agency, Paris, 2nd] Following Foreign Minister Wang's speech, Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun again delivered a speech in Chinese today. Zhang stated in the Third Committee this morning China's position on the draft Declaration of Human Rights. Zhang declared that China supports the draft Declaration of Human Rights in its current general form, but emphasized that this declaration should be a simple document for the general public, not a lengthy document for jurists. Zhang delivered this speech in fluent Mandarin and a scholarly tone.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The Soviet Union attacked the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights on the 3rd, denouncing it as "reactionary and oppressive." Poland and Belarus supported the Soviet Union. This declaration will be put to a vote at the current General Assembly.

### Many Obstacles to the Formation of a Group of Near and Middle Eastern Countries

[Central News Agency, Paris, 2nd] Persons close to the delegations of Egypt, Turkey and Greece replied to a question from a Central News Agency reporter, saying that the United Press report that 12 countries in the Near and Middle East (including Afghanistan, Egypt, Abyssinia, Greece, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and Yemen) are taking steps to establish an Eastern bloc within the framework of the United Nations is a great exaggeration. They also said that there are many obstacles to the establishment of such a bloc.

(1) The United Kingdom and the United States are the masterminds behind this bloc plan. Now the 12 countries concerned oppose the UK and US policy of partitioning the Holy Land, and the fierce opposition from the Arab side alone is an insurmountable obstacle. (2) The UK and US are eager to encourage the establishment of an Eastern bloc, intending to use the bloc as an anti-Soviet bastion in the Middle East to protect their oil interests at present, and to use it as a military ally in the future in times of war. However, well-informed Egyptian sources pointed out, "We do not intend to be tools for the UK and US oil interests, nor do we want to fight against the Soviet Union."

### The Socialist Party Refuses to Support Hitoshi Ashida; the Fate of the Cabinet is Sealed; the Socialist Party Meeting Today Will Determine the Fate of the Government

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The changes in the Japanese political situation have shown a sharp turn in recent days. The second three-party meeting, which was decided at the previous three-party meeting to be held on the 4th, has now been cancelled. It will be replaced by a liaison meeting between cabinet ministers from the Socialist Party and party executives. The Socialist Party members in the cabinet, Kato and Nomizo, and the Socialist Party's Diet Affairs Committee Chairman, Saikubo, all insist on the resignation of the cabinet. Important executives of the Socialist Party said that even if the next regime falls into the hands of the extremely conservative Liberal Democratic Party, it will not be obvious. The Kurisu incident occurred in the Ashida cabinet, and there is no face to face the people of the country. It is expected that the resignation of the cabinet will be won in the liaison meeting on the 4th.

As for the timing of the resignation, it is generally predicted to be before the Socialist Party holds its Central Executive Committee meeting (to be held on the 7th). At present, Ashida and the Democratic Party are in an extremely difficult and passive position, and will not be able to change the political situation.

[Another Dispatch] The Japanese Democratic Party held an emergency executive meeting in the Diet building on the 2nd. Ashida and Inukai attended and exchanged views on how to deal with the political situation in the future. Most people still insisted on separating Kurisu's personal criminal behavior from the Democratic Party government's problem. They also strongly encouraged Ashida to continue to summon the courage to take responsibility for the government. However, it is rumored that Ashida's attitude seems to have become negative, but it is still too early to predict whether it is because he fears that Kurisu's criminal problem will be related to Ashida. In short, the power of the Socialist Party, the largest friendly party, is now unwilling to continue to support the Ashida cabinet, so its fate has been sealed.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 3rd] Today, all the editorials of Tokyo newspapers unanimously demanded Ashida's resignation.

### The United States Appoints Sebald as Minister to Japan

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] Although the officials did not disclose the information of the talks between French Foreign Minister Schuman and British Foreign Secretary Bevin this morning, according to information obtained by the agency, the two foreign ministers exchanged views extensively on the foreign issues currently facing the two countries. In addition to the Berlin incident to be discussed by the Security Council next Monday, they also discussed various issues related to the common interests of the five Western European countries and the organization of the European Federation. Bevin was assisted by British Ambassador to France Harvey and Robert, the special envoy to the Soviet Union.

### US and British Generals Approve the Enlistment of Spain into Joint Defense; US Military Committee Returns Home

[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 2nd] Spanish officials today admitted that the talks between Franco and US Military Committee Chairman Clay here focused on the Spanish military potential. Spanish newspapers all carried long articles saying that US and British generals, including General Montgomery, all agree that Spain should join the Western European group.

Among the arrested military personnel were General Yookhsing, the former commander of the First Military District, and Sathantanon, the director of the Bangkok Arsenal. During the search, gunfire was exchanged around the Ministry of National Defense, but fortunately no one was injured. At the same time, the domestic situation is also calm. This incident seems to be limited to the military.

[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 3rd] Police authorities here arrested twenty civil and military officials on the night of the 2nd for launching a coup to overthrow the Phibunsongkhram government. The names of these arrested officials are kept extremely secret. It is reported that some of them were officials in the Phannarong cabinet that was overthrown in the November 1947 coup.

### Cabinet Reshuffle in Albania

### The Yugoslav Communist Party Publicly Criticizes the Soviet Union for Pressuring Yugoslavia

Forcing it to Take a Path That Does Not Suit the National Conditions

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 2nd] The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ began publishing documents today of mutual attacks between the Communist Information Bureau and the Yugoslav Communist Party. The newspaper said that the Hungarian and Romanian governments have begun to oppress the Yugoslav minorities in their respective countries, while the Yugoslav government will never discriminate against the Hungarian and Romanian minorities in Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ accused the Soviet Union of deliberately underestimating the achievements of socialist construction in Yugoslavia, misinterpreting the nature of the Yugoslav revolution, and spreading accusations of Yugoslav nationalism. The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ said, "In fact, they want to pressure Yugoslavia to take a path in its revolutionary process that does not suit Yugoslavia's national conditions, and want to make Yugoslavia take a step backward instead of moving forward." The newspaper denied that there was any similarity between the Tito incident and the Polish Gomulka incident. Gomulka was one of the leaders of the Polish Communist Party and was also accused of deviating from the Marxist line. The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ concluded that the dispute between the Communist Information Bureau and the Yugoslav Communist Party was due to the Information Bureau's unwillingness to understand the true nature of the Yugoslav revolution.

It was decided that the city would be divided into thirty-two districts, and all warehouses and storage facilities, regardless of their nature, would be inspected, with the principle of minimizing disruption. Yu Shuping will oversee this work. (2) The supply of small vegetable markets and fish markets is inadequate.

(3) The first economic control conference for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and Beijing and Shanghai cities, originally scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 7th, will proceed. With the expansion of economic control scope, inspection efforts should also be expanded to ensure comprehensive coordination. (4) Random checks on registered materials of various trade associations will commence in the coming days, after all necessary procedures are completed.

[Another report] A spokesperson for the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office announced to Central News Agency reporters at 8 PM on the 3rd: (1) The Inspection Committee held a routine meeting at 10 AM on the 3rd. Concrete decisions regarding the general inspection of materials throughout the city have been made, and a full-scale rollout will commence in the coming days.

Regarding the issue of increasing rice supply, Supervisor Chiang announced that merchants transporting rice to Shanghai are permitted to purchase soap and cloth to take back after selling their rice in Shanghai. The yarn and cloth market will temporarily suspend trading, but yarn and cloth will still be supplied as usual to those who need it. Legitimate requests can be submitted by the various trade associations to the manufacturers for purchase. Mr. Chiang also declared that prices, except for those related to increased taxes, will remain unchanged according to the "August 19th" price limits. Shanghai has sufficient inventory to meet demand, and the price control policy will not be changed. Responsible persons from the various trade associations unanimously expressed their support for this policy on the spot.

### Prices of Thirty-Three Kinds of Domestic Cigarettes Approved; Cigarette and Paper Shops Throughout the City Reopen Today; Prices of Yizhong and Imported Cigarettes Being Approved

[Report from our newspaper] The new market and wholesale/retail prices of cigarettes after the tax increase were approved yesterday by the Social Bureau, based on adjusted proportions, for thirty-three kinds of domestic cigarettes, including Golden Mouse. The new prices are 90% to 120% higher than the original prices. All cigarette stores and paper shops throughout the city, which had been closed for two days, were notified by the association to reopen for business today and sell at the new prices. The prices of various brands of Yizhong cigarettes (White Tin Pack, Three Cannon Towers, Great Britain, Old Knife Qianmen, etc.) have not yet been approved because the company requested an increase in the factory price to adjust for foreign exchange differences. The prices of various foreign cigarettes (including canned and packaged cigarettes such as 555, 39, Morris, Old Gold, Lucky Strike, etc.) are also being submitted to the Economic Control Supervisor's Office for approval and have not yet been agreed upon, so valley cigarette stores are temporarily suspending sales.

Although yesterday was the Social Bureau's regular weekly holiday, the Economic Administration Department continued to work as usual. Deputy Section Chief Zhou Weixin of the Price Management Section summoned representatives from the Cigarette Industry Association and the Cigarette, Soap, Candle, and Match Business Association to deliberate on the new prices of cigarettes after the tax increase. The calculation principle is based on adding a 76% finished product tax and a 19% tobacco raw material tax to the August 19th price, plus a foreign exchange difference calculation. Except for White Horse and Horseshoe domestic cigarettes, whose new prices have not been approved because the manufacturers have not submitted reports, the new prices of the thirty-three approved domestic cigarettes are as follows: (All in Gold Yuan)

### Getting Drunk Not Easy; New Restaurant Wine Prices Approved

[Report from our newspaper] The Sauce Wine Business Association submitted its proposed new wine prices, based on the adjusted proportions of goods, to the Social Bureau for approval. It is reported that the Social Bureau has approved the following: First-class sorghum wine at 54 cents per catty (August 19th price 32 cents), second-class at 48 cents per catty (original price 29 cents), and third-class at 44 cents per catty (original price 26 cents).

### Limited Gold Jewelry in Silver Shops; Transactions Cannot Proceed

Since the announcement of the new financial plan, the silver jewelry business has virtually come to a standstill because bars of silver cannot be melted down for processing. Apart from earning handling fees by exchanging old gold for new, most large and small businesses have limited reserves and rarely exchange gold jewelry for cash. As a result, those with cash are switching to purchasing diamonds and jewelry, causing a sharp rise in jewelry prices. According to insiders, to maintain storefront operations, larger silver shops such as Fang Jiuxia, Qiu Tiandou, and Yang Qinghe still sell dozens of wire rings weighing five to six fen each, at the price limit plus a handling fee, and they are all pure gold. The amount sold by each store depends on the amount received, but unless the authorities allow the melting of old gold jewelry, transactions in the industry cannot proceed.

### The Dead's Money and Wealth Are抢夺; Demand Exceeds Supply at All Tin Foil Shops; Increased Taxes Lead to Demands for Price Increases

[Report from our newspaper] The city's Foil Business Association has submitted new prices, based on the adjusted tax rate proportions, to the Social Bureau due to the increase in commodity tax on tin foil. Before the Social Bureau approves the adjustments, all foil shops are still selling at the original prices. According to industry insiders, because cigarette stores have been closed recently, merchants from the surrounding countryside who come to Shanghai to purchase cigarettes are shifting their focus to tin foil and rushing to buy it, resulting in a shortage of production at foil factories. Some foil shops are already limiting purchases, restricting customers to one piece of paper foil or one box of folded paper ingots per person.

### Overview of Work at the Shanghai High Procuratorate; Over 10,000 Cases Handled in Three Years; No Defendants Released on Bail Have Escaped; Only 30-Odd Cases of Traitors Remain Unresolved

A responsible person from the High Procuratorate gave reporters an overview of the work of the procuratorate since its establishment: The procuratorate was established in October 1945 and, as of the end of May this year, has handled a total of over 12,000 criminal cases, of which over 11,000 have been closed, averaging over 300 cases per month. Among these, 2,176 cases of traitors were received, of which 2,122 have been closed. As of the end of last month, only 30-odd cases remained to be investigated. The unresolved cases of traitors are currently being actively investigated by the responsible prosecutors to gather evidence, with the aim of completing the investigation within this year. The procuratorate is extremely cautious about prosecuting cases. Those for whom evidence is confirmed are prosecuted according to the law. Therefore, of the 1,753 defendants prosecuted by the procuratorate, only 109 have been declared innocent, accounting for 6% of the number of prosecutions. The detention of defendants is also determined according to the severity of their crimes. Those whose cases are not serious are not easily detained. Therefore, defendants have not been detained for some time. All those who are granted bail have their bail procedures handled by clerks dispatched by the procuratorate, to demonstrate seriousness. Miraculously, no defendants released on bail have escaped in the past three years. The procuratorate strives for speed in handling official documents. All routine documents are handled as soon as they arrive and are never backloged. The former French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Valléry, once personally visited the Chief Prosecutor of the procuratorate, Mr. Du Baoqi, to thank him because his official documents to the procuratorate were always replied to within 48 hours. As a sign of respect, he presented Chief Prosecutor Du with an honorary membership in the French General Association. It is reported that Mr. Du is the first judicial officer in China to receive this honor.

### The Psychology of Favoring Goods Over Currency Needs to Be Corrected; Unprecedented Frenzy of Panic Buying; Canvas Shops All Lower Their Iron Gates; Medicine Stores Issue Orders for Delivery Ten Days Later

[Report from our newspaper] Since the authorities implemented the price control policy, formal market transactions have become sparse, while retail stores are filled with customers, with limited space available. The reasons for this are nothing more than the loose monetary policy and the fact that citizens had accumulated astonishing amounts of US dollars and small gold bars in the past. After complying with the authorities' orders to exchange them for Gold Yuan, due to the deeply ingrained concept of favoring goods over currency over the past few years, the public regards the August 19th price limits as unprecedentedly low prices and are vying to purchase and store goods. Some items, such as medicines, wool yarn, meats, and fabrics, are becoming the target of scalpers and carting gangs due to either short supply or seasonal needs. Where there is profit, they flock like ducks to water. As a result, long snake-like lines of these individuals can be seen everywhere on the streets. Yesterday was Sunday, and the streets were even more lively. Passersby were carrying large and small packages, returning fully loaded. Most silk and cotton fabric shops had their iron gates tightly closed, posting signs saying "Sold out today, please come early tomorrow." Wool yarn shops switched to selling leather goods. Cigarette and foil shops have been closed for two days due to tax increases, and addicts are flocking to foreign goods stalls to purchase and smoke cigarettes from military ration boxes. The most prosperous businesses are department stores and shoe and hat shops, with employees sweating profusely and unable to keep up with demand. The most ridiculous situation is that of restaurants specializing in dim sum, which cannot even supply noodles after 9 AM. Furthermore, due to today being the first day of the lunar month, all medicinal wines, pills, and elixirs at the more famous Chinese medicine shops have been crowded and purchased completely. Some stores are even saying that they cannot produce enough and are issuing orders to customers, with delivery to be made ten days later. This kind of herding mentality and rush to buy has been around for a long time, but recently it has become even more rampant. This is certainly due to the prevailing psychology of the general public, but how to balance supply and demand to adapt to the unprecedented purchasing power of citizens requires careful consideration and prompt action by the economic control authorities.

### Pacification and Construction Team Holds Tea Party; Hosts Police Bureau Chiefs and District Heads

[Report from our newspaper] The Pacification and Construction Team held a tea party at the Lido Hotel yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, hosting district heads from various districts of the city and chiefs of various police bureaus to connect and exchange ideas. Over a hundred guests attended, including the Chief of the Police Bureau, Yu Shuping. The leader of the Pacification and Construction Team, Wang Sheng, first expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of the various districts and bureaus and said that the Pacification and Construction Team is assisting those in charge of grassroots politics in building a new Shanghai, and asked for their guidance. Then, the bureau chiefs and district heads spoke, praising the achievements of the Pacification and Construction Team's work and presenting various opinions. Some believed that more emphasis should be placed on propaganda to change the psychology of merchants and increase production to alleviate the recent shortage of goods. Others raised issues of work coordination, which should be properly addressed, or suggested that the Pacification and Construction Team should pay more attention to fundamental issues and not worry too much about minor details. Some felt that the "pacification" work had already achieved considerable results and that more efforts should be made in the "construction" aspect in the future. Chief Yu Shuping said that since the Pacification and Construction Team came to Shanghai, the Police Bureau has received assistance from many comrades in economic control work, resolving many difficulties. The working spirit of the Pacification and Construction Team members has also enhanced the enthusiasm of the Police Bureau personnel and improved discipline. He expressed hope for continued close cooperation. Leader Wang responded. The tea party ended at around 5 PM.

### Authorities Planning Methods; To Control Important Pharmaceuticals

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Ministry of Health recently received a report from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau that Western pharmacies in the city have no stock of important medicines such as penicillin, and are investigating whether anyone is hoarding or manipulating prices. The Ministry is dispatching personnel to conduct a thorough inspection with the Police Bureau, and is drafting detailed methods to strictly control the sales of various important medicines. Director Zhang and others are planning to come to Beijing soon to discuss the matter.

### Investors Shifting Targets; Real Estate Industry Flourishing; Real Estate Industry Association Responds to "Ten Thousand Buildings" Movement; Raising Funds to Purchase Over Five Mu of Vacant Land on Dunxin Road to Build Houses

[Special Report from our Newspaper] The August 19th currency reform has injected a shot of adrenaline into Shanghai's long-paralyzed real estate industry. From an objective perspective, market fluctuations in various industries have been reduced to a minimum under the weight of controls. However, speculative capital spilling over from the stock market and gold/US dollar exchange must find a home. As a result, real estate has once again become the darling of investors.

However, the real estate that is the darling of investors is still limited to the following two types: (1) vacant houses that can be lived in, and (2) vacant land on which houses can be built. It is estimated that real estate that meets these conditions accounts for only about one-fifth of the total real estate in the city. Supply is limited, and there are few sellers but many buyers, so it is no wonder that prices are rising higher and higher. Since August 19th, the rate of increase in prices of this type of real estate has reached a recent high of double, from an initial two or three percent. Apart from this type of real estate, other types, such as vacant land in factories or slum areas, and occupied lane houses and apartments, have not only not seen an increase in prices, but even transactions are rare.

Shanghai West is the Hottest, Prices Rising by 100%

According to conservative estimates, the recent rate of increase in land prices is highest in the Shanghai West district, with an average increase of 40% to 100%. For example, vacant land in the best section of Yuyuan Road in Shanghai West currently has a market price of about 80,000 yuan per mu, equivalent to forty large gold bars. Even slightly inferior land costs about 40,000 yuan per mu. The section of Daxi Road near Jing'an Temple costs 70,000 yuan per mu, and even further west it is cheaper, but the lowest price is close to 30,000 yuan per mu. Other areas such as Dunxin Road cost about 40,000 to 60,000 yuan per mu. It is said that even the vacant land on both sides of Jinji Road, the only way to Longhua Airport, is now selling for 30,000 yuan per mu.

The land prices in other districts, ranked according to the size of the increase, should be Hongkou District, Nanshi District, Zhabei District, and Shanghai East District. Although the rate of increase in these areas is not as fierce as in the Shanghai West District, the best land, depending on the quality of the location, has also increased by as much as 100%, and the worst has increased by at least 20%. As for the central area, houses have long been densely packed, and vacant land is as rare as phoenix feathers, making it the most difficult to find and the most expensive.

Building 10,000 Houses Within Six Months

With land prices increasing daily, transactions are naturally flourishing. According to Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau, before August 19th, the bureau handled less than ten real estate transfer cases per day. After August 19th, the number of transfer cases has increased daily, and recently the number of transfer cases per day has increased to more than twenty. Therefore, judging solely from the number of transfer cases at the Land Administration Bureau, the transaction volume of real estate after August 19th has increased by double. The most common transactions are for one or two mu of vacant land.

To cooperate with the emergency financial and economic measures, the Land Administration Bureau has recently implemented policies to encourage speculative capital to invest in real estate, especially in building houses. Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau has stated that the recently established Shanghai Municipal Housing Construction Promotion Committee has decided to promote a "Ten Thousand Buildings" movement within six months. This movement aims to complete the construction of 10,000 new houses in various districts of the city within six months. Various preferential treatments will be given to homeowners who build houses, such as: (1) exemption from land value tax for three years, and (2) exemption from house tax for one year. If houses are built within six months of purchasing land and sold within one year, they will be exempt from land appreciation tax. At the same time, the municipal government will do its best to provide various conveniences for the water and electricity facilities and transportation conditions of new houses. Recently, it is also planned to divide new residential areas in the five districts of Shanghai West, Nanshi, Zhabei, Shanghai East, and Pudong. Housing must be built in these residential areas within a specified period. If housing is not built within the specified period, a vacant land tax will be levied. This vacant land tax will be levied at three times the land value tax and will increase to ten times within a year and a half. This is a kind of pressure on landowners, forcing them to take the path of building new houses, which is also an aid in solving the city's housing shortage. Director Zhu expressed full confidence in completing this "Ten Thousand Buildings" movement.

New Organization of the Real Estate Industry

The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association is now taking the lead in responding to this "Ten Thousand Buildings" movement. The committee, collectively supported by the association's members, has now formed the first investment group, which has purchased over five and a half mu of vacant land on Dunxin Road, with a transaction price of approximately 200,000 yuan. This group plans to invest another 400,000 yuan in this piece of land, planning to build forty single-family houses or twenty double-family houses. The design of the houses is currently being studied and is expected to be completed within three months. This can be said to be the prelude to the entire movement, and it is hoped that investors will respond and help solve the city's housing shortage problem.

Judging from the current favorable objective environment, the real estate industry, which has been dormant for many years, will surely have a future of recovery. At best, the authorities only need to control housing rents related to people's livelihoods. In addition, the price of real estate itself, in a situation where the price of everything else is limited but real estate is not, will have sufficient room for activity, making it easier for real estate to become a target for speculative capital.

### Taiwan慰劳團 Attends Welcome Tea Party; Represents Taiwanese Compatriots in Expressing Hope for Pacification

[Report from our newspaper] The six-member Taiwan Provincial慰劳團 has arrived in Shanghai. Various circles in the city held a tea party at the Shanghai Club yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome them. Zhang Fang, leader of the Central Plains慰劳團 who recently returned from慰劳troops in the Central Plains, and Deputy Leader Dui Renzhao, were also invited to attend to report on their experiences. The Taiwan慰劳團 included团长Huang Liandeng, Provincial Councilor; Deputy团长Huang Zhenqiu, Section Chief of the Department of Social Affairs;团员Chen Tianshun, Chairman of the General Labor Union; Li Junyao, Director of the Provincial Farmers Association; Xu Shixian, Standing Director of the Women's Association; and Qiu Zhangmei, Section Chief of the Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang. Representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal参议会, the General Labor Union, and other units in the city also attended.

Bringing Donations; Sugar and Tea Abundant

First, Fang Zhi introduced the two sides. Then, 团长Huang delivered a speech, stating that Taiwan Province has been able to progress steadily in recent years thanks to the soldiers on the front lines pacifying the country. The 6.5 million compatriots in Taiwan Province, to express their respect for the loyal and brave soldiers, specially formed the慰劳團, bringing donations from all walks of life, including 300 boxes of white sugar, 40 boxes of black tea, 20 boxes of cigarettes, 4 boxes of cigars, and 100 brocade banners, intending to go to the Xu, Bian, Ping, and Fan areas to慰劳troops. He said that Taiwanese compatriots are eagerly hoping for the early success of pacification and wholeheartedly support the government's measures such as military grain requisition and currency reform. Rumors that Taiwanese compatriots are seeking trusteeship or independence are purely fabricated rumors. Taiwanese compatriots believe that this would insult their sincerity in striving to return to the motherland for nearly a century. He further said that he was greatly pleased to see that the extravagant situation in society had been greatly reduced since he came to Shanghai, and hoped that people on both sides of Taiwan and Shanghai would work together towards the goal of nation-building under the same living standards. Subsequently, Huang Zhenqiu, Chen Tianshun, and Li Junyao delivered speeches, stating that all circles in Taiwan Province are burying themselves in construction work, and that there have been good achievements in agriculture and industry since the restoration. They hoped to contribute to the pacification work and achieve victory as soon as possible.

Zhang Fang and Xie Renzhao Talk about慰劳Troops Experience

Finally, Zhang Fang and Xie Renzhao reported on their experiences in慰劳troops in the Central Plains and put forward points to note in慰劳work: (1) Bring more medicines and medical supplies and donate them to wounded soldier hospitals. (2) Bring more books and magazines to enrich the lives of soldiers on the front lines with spiritual food. (3) Interact more with lower-level cadres and soldiers in various units. (4) Listen more to civilian reports to exchange opinions between the front and rear people. The Taiwan慰劳團 expressed its acceptance, and the meeting ended at 15:00.

慰劳團 Goes to Beijing

The慰劳團 has taken the night train to Beijing last night. After consulting with the Ministry of National Defense and the慰劳总会 to determine everything, they can start their journey. The entire itinerary is expected to take 45 days.

### Military Friends Association Reorganization Completed

Emphasis on Cultural and Recreational Activities

Regarding various news reports about the Military Friends Association yesterday, the spokesperson of the association's committee clarified that the association is now jointly managed by people from all walks of life and various party, government, and military organs. It has expanded its foundation and fundamentally changed from a private business nature to serving military friends entirely. All operations emphasize military cultural and recreational activities. Currently, they are preparing for reading rooms, reading groups, music concerts, poetry clubs, calligraphy and painting clubs, literary clubs, lecture series, travel agencies, and group weddings. As for the restaurants, tea houses, and salons that were originally privately operated, they have been completely transformed to serve military personnel. The Chinese and Western cuisine tea house is managed by Wei Yingjing, the former director of the Chongqing Anti-Japanese Construction Hall, who also serves as the director of the association's recreation department. Rumors that the Oriental Hotel and Central Hotel have contracted the operations are absolutely untrue. The salon is managed by Kuniaki Kuko, a resident Japanese technician, and fully maintains an oriental atmosphere. As for the association's working policy, it intends to focus on the "Diligent and Frugal Nation-Building Movement," striving to achieve "civilian life in the rear and soldier life at the front."

### Gunshots at Dusk in the Southern City: Bandit Attempts to Resist Arrest, Shot in the Back

[Reported by this Newspaper] The Penglai Police Precinct in the southern city received a tip-off yesterday at dusk that two bandits were planning to rob a certain store in Zhongshipi Lane in the city at night, and were currently having tea at Xinglong Tea Garden at the intersection of Lujiabang Road and Daxing Street in the southern city. Precinct Chief Wu immediately ordered the Criminal Division to investigate and apprehend them. Division Chief Li Dazhi personally led officers Lu Jifeng, Li Xianwen, Bian Xicheng, Li Fengyong, Chen Hailin, and others to the tea garden. Unexpectedly, the bandits spotted the police officers arriving and immediately tried to escape. Officer Lu gave chase and captured one bandit, Shi Jinshan (from Chongming, 31 years old, residing at 182 Qufu Road), on the spot. The other bandit fled to Dadian Street and was about to turn into the intersection of Jiangyin Street when the police officers caught up. At a distance of about twenty feet, they shouted for him to stop. The bandit ignored the warning and reached into his pocket for a Browning pistol, preparing to turn around and fire to resist arrest. Officer Bian Xicheng, seeing this, immediately opened fire, hitting the bandit in the back. The bullet went through his stomach and exited through the front. He staggered a few steps before falling to the ground, spitting blood from his mouth, barely breathing. He dropped the gun he was holding (with five bullets inside) on the side of the road. He was rushed to the police hospital. Upon checking his ID, he was identified as Shen Weixin, 31 years old, from Chongming, residing in Xuejiaku, Zhenru. It was discovered that his real name was actually Yang Ximeng, a former cook who had committed numerous thefts in his hometown of Leming and was wanted by the police.

### Refugees Relocating to Jiangxi: Implementation Stage Reached, First Batch of 3,500 People to Begin Registration Soon

[Reported by this Newspaper] The Municipal Government is organizing resettlement teams to relocate to Jiangxi to cultivate wasteland to provide relief for refugees who have fled to Shanghai. This plan has now reached the implementation stage. The Shanghai Relief Committee originally planned to resettle 5,000 families in the first phase, with each family consisting of four people, totaling 20,000 people. After discussions with the Jiangxi Provincial Government, they will first send 3,500 people. The Relief Committee has prepared a budget, including building sheds after arriving at the destination, purchasing farm cattle, furniture, tools, and six months' worth of staple and non-staple food, totaling 180,420 gold yuan. After six months, the sweet potatoes and other crops they plant will be able to support themselves. The Relief Committee is currently raising funds for this project and will soon send personnel to Jiangxi to prepare everything. After returning to Shanghai, they will begin processing registration and sending people off.

Capacity for 70,000 Refugees

According to investigations, there are currently as many as 788,900 acres of wasteland in Jiangxi Province. Assuming that each person cultivates ten acres, it may be possible to accommodate 70,000 refugees. The first batch of 3,500 people is scheduled to be allocated to the following reclamation sites: Dexing 200 people, Dean 100 people, Yongxiu 500 people, Zixi 100 people, Lichuan 100 people, Chongren 100 people, Lean 200 people, Jikoushui 300 people, Anfu 1,100 people, Taihe 300 people, Wan'an 200 people, Nanfeng 100 people, Guangchang 200 people.

Universal Survey Implemented

Because resettlement in Jiangxi is one of the main decisions of the city's relief efforts, in order to prevent a small number of professional refugees from attempting to stay in Shanghai and live a life of dependency, a universal survey will be conducted on refugees who do not participate. All (1) those who have been certified by a doctor to be physically and mentally healthy and capable of working, (2) those who have engaged in agriculture for more than three years and have been certified, and (3) those who are between the ages of sixteen and forty-five without special or obvious symptoms of illness, should participate in the resettlement. Otherwise, they will be sent back to their hometowns within a specified period.

### Completion of the Entire Caobin Road

Northern Section of Construction Completed

Caobao Road, a major road in the western suburbs, starts from the Shanghai-Minhang Highway in the east and connects to Hongqiao Road and Qinghu Road in the north, serving as a major communication line for Caohejing and Qibao towns in the suburbs. In recent years, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has carried out phased construction. The entire road's bridges and the section from the Shanghai-Minhang Highway to Qibao Town have been renovated and completed, allowing for smooth traffic. However, the northern section from Qitou Town to the Hongqiao-Qinghu Road section has not yet been completed, causing inconvenience for vehicles traveling north. Last year, the bureau prepared a budget and planned for construction, which was only approved this year. At that time, due to a large discrepancy in the budget, the project almost came to a halt. However, thanks to the efforts of the bureau in charge, they managed to cut costs, reduce standards slightly, and utilize mechanical road construction, eventually achieving completion. That section of the project was completed yesterday.

### Weather Forecast

Shanghai: Cloudy, hazy, clear strong northwest to north wind, possibility of showers in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the evening. Three-day temperature: Minimum 20.6 degrees Celsius (69.0 degrees Fahrenheit), maximum 24.1 degrees Celsius (75.3 degrees Fahrenheit)

Weekly Economy

### General Prices: Prices Recover from Weakness, Most Rise to Limit

Approximately forty days have passed since the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. The deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency held by the people was originally set for the end of September, which could have been considered a conclusion, but it has now been extended by another month to the end of October. Looking at the situation in the month or so since the implementation of the new economic plan, there are still many areas that urgently need improvement. Generally speaking:

(1) It is estimated that the amount of idle capital in Shanghai currently exceeds 400 million yuan. It is also reported that the method of remitting funds from the Northeast to the interior has been abolished, and it is expected that a large amount of capital will flow to Tianjin and Beijing, and then to Shanghai. The authorities have not been able to effectively channel idle capital, which remains a major threat to the plan.

(2) Since the implementation of price controls, because of the rigid regulations, the relationship between some finished products and raw materials has not been reasonably adjusted, which has a significant impact on increasing production. At the same time, due to the different price levels between this port and other ports, goods from this port are attempting to escape abroad, while raw materials and local products from other ports are unwilling to come in.

(3) The authorities seem to be very slow in managing and utilizing the assets of Chinese people abroad, while being very active in implementing the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency from the people at home. In contrast, not only does the handling appear unfair, but also in today's urgent need for foreign exchange, the government's relaxation of this aspect gives people a sense of putting the cart before the horse.

The trend of market prices last week initially showed weakness due to the authorities' control and the holding of a general registration of materials, causing public anxiety. However, prices quickly rebounded and mostly reached the price increase limit. Some goods even experienced a shutdown or semi-shutdown state.

In the cotton yarn market, Blue Phoenix yarn still had no trading activity. 21-count Double Horse yarn initially saw a low price of 760 yuan due to the registration of inventory, but from Tuesday to Friday, it stood firmly at 783 yuan. 관頭细布 experienced more fluctuations, with a low of 26.4 yuan on Monday and Tuesday and a high of 28 yuan on Thursday.

In the grain market, the price of rice increased due to rising prices in the producing areas, creating a reverse price phenomenon. Sources were scarce, and high-end goods disappeared from the market. The market prices for white rice in both the North and South markets remained at 20.78 yuan and 20.9 yuan. The flour market was completely stagnant, and only a small number of miscellaneous grains were traded, with many entering a semi-stagnant state. The edible oil market was strong, with the price of Qingdao Jisheng oil remaining unchanged at 59.9 yuan throughout the week. The trend of daily necessities also showed some positive signs. On Friday, Gu Ben soap stood at 26.8 yuan, an increase of 1.2 yuan compared to the previous weekend's 25.6 yuan. Beautiful matches stood at 119 yuan on the weekend, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous weekend's 117 yuan. Due to the scarcity of deliveries, cigarettes were in short supply, and more miscellaneous brands were seen on the market.

In order to strengthen economic control, the Executive Yuan meeting decided to expand the scope of the established Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and three supervisory areas, and add one more area in Central China. The areas are as follows: (1) Shanghai area: Shanghai, Nanjing, and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; (2) Guangzhou area: Guangzhou and the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian; (3) Tianjin and Beijing area: Tianjin, Beijing, and Qingdao, and the provinces of Hebei and Shandong; (4) Hankou area: Hankou, Chongqing, and the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Jiangxi. Regarding strengthening economic control, controlling materials, and holding comprehensive distribution matters, President Weng convened relevant officials for a discussion to exchange opinions. It was believed that the situation in various regions was very good, but there were still the following phenomena:

(1) The strict implementation of economic control in Shanghai has caused the prices of some important industrial raw materials in Shanghai to be lower than those in the producing areas, which has led to a tendency to cut off sources of supply, which has a significant impact on production. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the implementation of economic control comprehensively in the major regions.

(2) Due to the different levels of various price limits set on August 19 in the major regions of the country, some exceeded the reasonable prices at that time, while others were not enough to maintain costs. Both will be adjusted according to their actual situation to achieve balance and avoid the escape of materials.

(3) Although the people in various regions are very fond of the new currency, the increase in bank deposits has not reached the ideal level. In order to strengthen people's confidence in the gold yuan, the issuance of gold yuan should be particularly tightened, and the past measures of issuing to make up for deficits should be eradicated. Regarding the control of materials and distribution issues, it was believed that the supply side should formulate methods to strengthen the control of materials by the Economic Management Committee, and the government should purchase from the producing areas. On the distribution side, the non-comprehensive distribution system should continue to be implemented, and major daily necessities for the people should be rationally distributed in major cities. However, the purchase of materials should be done by region and at appropriate prices, without stimulating prices in the producing areas. At the same time, loan policies should be coordinated to encourage merchants to purchase, so that the source of materials is sufficient.

Regarding the Shanghai Economic Management Authority's general material registration, it ended at 6 PM on September 29. The types and quantities of registered items announced are as follows:

(1) The Edible Oil Business Association has 484 members who registered a total of 101,357 市担 (shi dan, a unit of weight) of soybean oil, raw oil, rapeseed oil, cooked raw oil, sesame oil, green oil, and ordinary oil, with each 市担 weighing fourteen catties.

(2) The Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association has 319 members who registered a total of 83,837 bags of soybeans.

(3) Over 2,180 boxes of artificial silk, over 800 dan of raw silk, and over 420 pieces of various cotton yarn and threads.

(4) The state-owned textile construction companies belonging to the Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai registered over 220,000 shi dan of cotton, over 1.25 million pounds of wool, over 1.5 million bolts of various cotton cloths, and over 14,000 pieces of cotton yarn, excluding semi-finished products. The amount of cotton yarn and cloth stored by private yarn factories belonging to the association in Shanghai was not announced.

(5) As of September 29, the Cotton Cloth Business Association had received 1,482 registration forms from its members, totaling 1,465,267 bolts of cotton cloth, 521,083 sections, 175,508 yards, 2,402 meters, 16,162 pounds, and 839 bed sheets, equivalent to approximately 2 million bolts.

Following the general material registration, a general material inspection was initiated. The inspection method was divided into 32 districts according to the Shanghai police district division. The items decided for general inspection were rice, edible oil, flour, cloth, yarn, paper, wax, and cotton, coal, and motor oil (referring to gasoline and diesel) among industrial raw materials. The inspection date was originally scheduled for three days, but it has now been decided to shorten it as much as possible, possibly completing it within two days. The authorities previously permitted passengers to carry contraband, but due to the activity of single smugglers and the organized transport of contraband out of the country, causing significant losses of materials, it was decided to temporarily suspend the application of that regulation.

According to the Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People, the deadline for the redemption of gold, silver, and foreign currency was originally set for September 30. It has now been decided by the Executive Yuan to extend the redemption of gold and foreign currency to the end of October, and the extension of silver, silver dollars, and silver coins to the end of November. Before the announcement of the extension of the exchange last week, the people were extremely enthusiastic about exchanging gold and banknotes. The national banks exchanged over 20 million to 32 million yuan of gold yuan every day. According to statistics, in Shanghai alone, from August 23 to September 30, the amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency exchanged totaled 372,482,715.8 yuan.

### Currency and Finance: Loose Monetary Policy Continued to Intensify Last Week, Sharp Increase in Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Exchange Leading to Outflow of Gold Yuan, Overabundance of Notes Inside and Outside the Industry, Difficult to Float Short-Term Funds

The loose monetary policy in Shanghai continued to intensify last week. Before the currency reform, the monetary policy still showed a cyclical pattern of alternating looseness and tightness. However, after the reform, the supply and demand of funds became unbalanced. The supply came continuously, but the demand hesitated to move forward. As a result, the excess of idle capital has been accumulating day by day. The factors that determined the continued loose monetary policy last week include the following:

(1) The deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency was approaching the end of September. The general public was still unaware that the authorities had decided to extend the original deadline for another month. As a result, the number of exchangers greatly increased, and the supply of gold yuan added another strong force.

(2) Although national banks and bureaus received payments such as sugar tax during the week, they also had large expenditures for purchasing materials. As a result, the clearing of notes was still in deficit every day. By Friday of last week, the banks and bureaus had been in deficit for 20 consecutive days. The total deficit has reached more than 40 million gold yuan. Such a long period of deficit is a first since the victory. Of course, it has played a significant role in supplying funds to the market.

(3) The war in the north became more intense, and idle capital flowed south again. On Monday, the authorities decided to cancel the quota limit for remittances from the Northeast. Naturally, under the principle of safety first, the amount of remittances from the north to Shanghai can be imagined.

(4) As September ended and October began, various industries needed cash for expenses such as paying salaries. Also, due to the convenience of carrying gold yuan, the flow of cash southward has been very strong in recent days. However, due to the ample reserves of chips in Shanghai, there has been no sign of shortage.

(5) Since the previous week, the number of short-term treasury bills sold has been quite considerable, totaling more than 50 million yuan. However, compared to the 400 to 500 million yuan or more of idle capital in Shanghai, it is like a small witch seeing a big witch. Only a little more than one-tenth of the chips could be recovered. The effect on tightening the monetary policy was minimal.

(6) On Monday of last week, the Yida Chang Money Shop in Shanghai was ordered to suspend business. On Wednesday, the Shanghai branch of the Yunnan Mining Bank also voluntarily closed down and withdrew from the note clearing house due to sluggish business. It is not difficult to speculate that as a result of strengthening financial controls, the demand for funds has been hesitant to move forward, which has blocked part of the path for idle capital. The long-term loose monetary policy is inevitably related to this.

Since some of the reasons for the loose monetary policy could not be fundamentally eliminated, idle capital formed an undercurrent and drilled through any gaps. Interest rates fell frequently, and note holders often had difficulty floating short-term funds. The officially posted interest rates for money shops last week were lowered again on Friday (October 1st). The deposit interest rate was 1.5% (originally 1.8%), the loan interest rate was 4.8% (originally 5.7%), and the interbank lending rate was 3% (originally 3.9%). The hidden interest rates last week were generally between 4.5% and 6%, with the lowest even reaching 3%, generally falling below the official interest rates of money shops. However, longer-term lending had higher monthly interest rates, such as 1.5 角 (jiao, a unit of currency) for half a month and 1.8 角 for more than a month. This also reflects the general view of the financial future, which is not optimistic. The discount interest rates for cargo groups also continued to decrease, generally at 2 yuan per day. On Wednesday, it even dropped to 1 yuan at one point, equivalent to only 3% interest.

National banks and bureaus continued to experience successive deficits last week. From Monday to Friday, the total deficit was 10.93 million yuan, a decrease of only over 200,000 yuan compared to the same period in the previous week.

The clearing results of foreign banks varied from day to day, with deficits and surpluses. While there were deficits on Wednesday and Friday, there were surpluses on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. However, the total for the five days was a surplus of 2.39 million yuan, a decrease of 1.69 million yuan compared to the same period in the previous week.

Commercial banks and money shops continued to have ample funds last week, with overabundance of notes being widespread. Interbank lending came to a halt. The clearing results of commercial banks and money shops after number 60 in Shanghai from Monday to Friday totaled a surplus of 6.16 million yuan, but this included a deficit of 170,000 yuan from the Taiwan Bank during the same period. Therefore, the actual indirect clearing of commercial banks and money shops should be a surplus of 6.33 million yuan, an increase of over 1.7 million yuan compared to the same period in the previous week.

As for the inland exchange rates of commercial banks last week, there was not much fluctuation. The Guangzhou exchange rate remained at 24 yuan, the Xiamen exchange rate at 20 yuan, the Hankou exchange rate at 10 yuan, the Chongqing exchange rate was 10 yuan on Monday and increased by 2 yuan to 12 yuan on Wednesday, the Kunming exchange rate was 12 yuan, and the Tianjin exchange rate was 5 yuan.

Also, the Hong Kong gold market fluctuated slightly. On Monday, the price of gold per tael (a unit of weight) was 308.75 Hong Kong dollars. It suddenly rose to 315.5 Hong Kong dollars on Tuesday. On Wednesday and Thursday, it fell back to 309.5 Hong Kong dollars. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong showed a downward trend. It was 5.23 Hong Kong dollars on Monday and Tuesday, and then shrank to 5.19 Hong Kong dollars on Wednesday and Thursday.

### New York Exhibition of Modern Chinese Painting: Introducing the Excellent Traditions and Creative Spirit of Our Nation, Opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Double Tenth Day

[News from New York via Airmail] The exhibition of modern Chinese painting, after six months of preparation, will open at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York this Double Tenth Day. This international art exhibition will be held for two consecutive months. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the most famous and first-class art museum in the United States, with a rich and exquisite collection of Eastern and European art works, comparable to the Louvre Museum in Paris and the British Museum in London. This Chinese painting exhibition held in the museum will surely cause a sensation in the United States and attract the attention of people from all walks of life, which is expected.

According to reports, in January of this year, the painter Wang Yachen was ordered by the Ministry of Education to go to the United States to investigate art education, and was entrusted by Zhang Daofan, the chairman of the International Cultural Cooperation Association, and Pan Gongzhan, the chairman of the Chinese Cultural Relics Research Association, to bring more than 120 paintings by modern Chinese masters. Thirty-two units, including Chinese art schools and associations, participated in the exhibition. A pre-exhibition review was held in Shanghai. At that time, the principle was to "rather be short of good quality than to accept bad quality" and to strive for perfection.

After arriving in the United States, with the assistance of Ambassador Gu Weijun, Consul Zhang Pingqun in New York, and Alan Priest, the director of the Eastern Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a preparatory committee for the exhibition was established, and the pieces were reviewed again. Alan Priest proposed to the museum's board of directors and was approved, deciding to hold a public exhibition on our country's National Day this year.

All the cataloging of the exhibited paintings, the selection and printing of target illustrations, and the exquisite printing design of the entire catalog were all presided over by Alan Priest, and the expenses were also borne by the museum. The exhibition catalog also has prefaces by Ambassador Gu, Lin Yutang, and Alan Priest.

Recently, Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan Chen Lifu visited the United States and provided detailed guidance, stressing that this exhibition must represent the entire landscape of modern Chinese painting and be able to express the excellent traditions and creative spirit of our nation.

It has recently been decided to hold a pre-exhibition on October 8, and 4,000 invitations have been sent to invite people from all walks of life in New York and its surrounding cities to visit. Ambassador Gu and Consul General Zhang will preside over the opening ceremony. (Wang Yaqian)

### "Prosperous Age" and "Alarmist Words"

— Lei Ting

I once read a book called "Alarmist Words in a Prosperous Age." The original author was a Taotai (circuit intendant) who advocated saving the country through industry. This work was written after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, when China's paper tiger had long been exposed. As a result, new slogans were shouted particularly loudly, and this author was naturally one who "arose in response to the times." As for his motivation for writing, whether it was purely out of love for the motherland or contained a sense of opportunism, I am not prepared to explore it further here. However, some of the plans he advocated may seem like clichés now, but at the time they were quite "relevant to the times." What particularly caught my attention was the title "Alarmist Words in a Prosperous Age."

To call China after the Sino-Japanese War a "prosperous age" was, of course, a scholar's cleverness, but in an autocratic era, one had to be so "opportunistic." While the source of "alarmist words" seems to come from the idiom "be mindful of danger in times of peace," with the meaning of preventing crises and consolidating the "prosperous age," the fact that "alarmist words" could actually arise in a "prosperous age" where everyone thought they were "safe" suggests that the author was somewhat worthy of pride, and the autocracy of the dying Qing dynasty was somewhat naively endearing.

Taking the current situation, after the War of Resistance against Japan, there was the suppression of bandits, with flames of war raging and refugees scattered everywhere. On the international front, there was both the Cold War and hot wars. Even if we could close ourselves off, it would not be enough to call it a "prosperous age," which cannot be denied. However, what about our "alarmist words"?

Summarizing the books and newspapers I can see (of course, for economic and time reasons, I see very little), they are nothing more than:

(1) Blindly praising and singing praises; (2) Slanderous abuse with ulterior motives; (3) Cold cynicism disguised as humor; (4) Fruitless messing around with antiques; these are still the better ones. In addition, things like women's legs, the daily lives of singers or stars, and the sensationalism of yellow journalism fill the pages of some publications.

In the autocratic era, there were still "alarmist words," but we are fortunate to be born in today's democratic era, where there are only nice-sounding words, poisonous words, boring words, and nauseating words. This is a cruel contrast. One fears danger even in times of peace, but we, in a situation as precarious as a pile of eggs, are still leisurely and self-satisfied. What a shameful numbness this is!

Of course, crying all day long or shouting from the sofa cannot save the precarious situation. Even the soldiers suppressing bandits on the front lines need to rest and have fun, right? However, it is most important not to abandon one's own work. Given the current situation, is the primary work of cultural figures who occupy leading positions in society today to blindly praise and be echo chambers, to spread rumors and abuse, to dig up old corpses, or to be intoxicated by the cherry lips of singers and women's legs?

Mr. Lu Xun seems to have given a speech in Hong Kong called "The Silent China." This is still a powerful lesson today because what he hoped for was not the chaotic and boring sounds mentioned above, but the true voice of the people. We now truly need the true voice of the people!

"Alarmist words" is not a pleasant term, but the effect of "alarmist words" can promote the realization of a "prosperous age." The meaning of "honest advice is unpleasant to the ear" lies here, not there.

### Strange Will

— Fan

A bizarre Englishman instructed his family in his will to bury him properly in a solid mausoleum. The reason was that he did not want his relatives to eat him. His reasoning was: "The worms in the soil will eat me first, then the ducks will eat the worms, and then my relatives will eat the ducks."

### "Dining Late Is Like Eating Meat"

— Shou Niu

Since the price controls of August 19th, pork has become almost extinct in the vegetable market, and beef is also difficult to buy. Nowadays, it is not easy to eat meat, and one cannot help but think of the ancients' saying "dining late is like eating meat." At first glance, this method is indeed very clever, but upon closer inspection and trying it out, it will make you laugh or cry. Eating after starving for half a day, even without meat, you will naturally feel that it tastes better than usual, even with meat. Leaving aside the many physiological issues, let's first say that this sentence came from a high-ranking official—"walking slowly is like riding a carriage, dining late is like eating meat." For a senior official to live so frugally, in today's Chinese situation, cannot be considered bad, but the problem is that since he does not ride in a carriage or eat meat, why does he still harbor the idea of eating meat as the highest standard? It can be seen that he still wants to eat. This is like saying that I don't dislike eating meat, but I just don't eat it, and then I come up with such a clever method to prove it to the emperor. There is a bit of flattery in this, as well as a bit of Ah Q spirit, and unknowingly, he reveals his true colors. If you don't eat meat, why not simply advocate vegetarianism—why "like eating meat"? If this gentleman were born now and became some kind of committee member promoting frugality, he would definitely show off his skills and might even come up with some even more ridiculous tricks.

Confucius seemed to pay much attention to nutrition. He thought it was good to eat meat, so he sang loudly, "At seventy, one is not satisfied without meat," without any embarrassment. But when he himself "did not know the taste of meat for three months," he grumbled endlessly and complained loudly. This lack of shame, genuine honesty, is rather endearing.

### Following and Responding to Inspector Yao's Poem Sent by the Hatchling

— San Mu

Life is not a hundred years, and fullness is just halfway. Alas, this thunderbolt hand, old and still holding a bald pen. Will it not flatter the world, can it be said to be self-pleasing? Intoxicated, he laughs at gain and loss, the bright moon shines on my wrist. Marquis Yao is now a public figure, thinking of his loose collar and hair, sending new poems from afar, with stirring words for mutual sighing. We guard our poor bones, willing to change with human affairs? Going out and laughing to the west, the jingling tassels are so brilliant. Originally not a midday golden pearl, why use green to forge? The end of the world is worth , the autumn air is even more faint. Killing all over the nine lands, groups have bitter escapes. The many men of our time are empty and fragmented, and I myself am true, covering my ears and bidding farewell to order, and I will forget Wei and Jin in a drunken state, what other Han can I have!

### A Trace of Smoke

— Ze Shi

Throughout the year, I only buy two things: cigarettes and books. Therefore, I don't ask or hear about rice prices or firewood prices, but I do know about cigarette prices. When prices fluctuate, I often say that my life will be shortened by a few years due to the rising cigarette prices. The price is secondary, for example, if Qianmen brand cigarettes cost several million per pack, as long as the price doesn't fluctuate for a year or so, those who want to eat them can buy them, and those who don't want to buy them can leave. What's frightening is that morning and evening prices are different. At 10:00 AM, a pack costs a million, and at 3:00 PM, it costs 1.25 million, giving you a sense of anxiety sooner or later, which I think can shorten my life. Now it's good, some cigarettes have a fixed price, the same last month, the same this month, and the same next month. If I have three jinyuan in my pocket, I can get a pack of Qianmen at any time, and I'm at peace of mind, which will definitely prolong my life.

However, I heard that better cigarettes or popular cigarettes are not easy to buy. I have not experienced this myself, but only know it indirectly. Originally, I bought five packs of Qianmen today and casually asked the clerk, "Is it moldy?" Who knew that a customer buying four cartons of a certain cigarette laughed and said, "It's hard to buy, and you still ask if it's moldy." I also laughed and said, "Do you mean that it's okay if the cigarettes that are hard to buy are moldy?"

"Of course."

"Then do you want my moldy cigarettes?"

"Yes, I want as many as you have."

Another clerk inside also laughed and said to me, "You're buying them to smoke, so you have to ask if they're moldy. He's buying them to do business, so he only cares if there are goods, not if they're moldy."

Oh, so that's how it is. I don't want to blame this cigarette trafficker for his immorality, knowing that he earns money without caring about the health of his customers, because I know that the dignified Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan also supplies the people with a large number of moldy cigarettes and has earned a reputation for virtuous governance. I only blame my own confusion: I still discuss good or bad in the autumn of scarcity.

But this is not only true of me personally, but probably also true of the 400 million compatriots. Everyone is hoping for and welcoming stable prices, but complaints are also everywhere: Parker 51 fountain pens are no longer available, only roosters are available for sale, and if you go a little late, there are none left, etc. These complaints are human nature, but there is one thing that everyone doesn't think about much, and that is that in extraordinary times, if you want stable prices, goods must be scarce. If you want to buy cheap things in extraordinary times and have everything available, it is practically impossible. Why? The reason is very simple: we are a country that relies solely on foreign goods, single gangs, or smuggling to have all the beauty and perfection. Now that prices cannot be raised arbitrarily, there is no profit to be made, so all the single gangs, import businesses, and smuggling tycoons are changing industries one by one, and all goods are becoming scarce. Hiding good things and not selling them is secondary, and those who hide them will eventually suffer losses. I tell friends who do pen business: the most popular Parker in the United States is no longer the 51, but the 102.

There are countries in the world where things are cheap and everything is available, but the Chinese have to think about it, who told you that you can't make a 102 fountain pen yourself?

### Letter to American Congressmen

— Chen Xiang

American congressmen constantly receive letters from all kinds of people. Besides the serious ones, these letters also have no lack of interesting ones. Now I extract and translate several to share with the readers of this publication. (The names of the recipients and senders have been omitted.)

I know that you have the privilege of sending letters for free.

I am now sending you all my New Year's cards, please send them for me, how about that?

Thank you.

I voted for you three times, I think you are admirable. Please send me nine hundred dollars immediately so I can buy a refrigerator and repaint my car.

P.S.: I voted for you three times in the 1946 election.

All my friends collect photos of movie stars, but I want to be different, so please send me photos of twelve congressmen. Please choose carefully, with the best funny faces.

Please do something for my house - my roof is leaking.

When there was a storm last night, I was eating dinner, the roof leaked so badly that my soup overflowed three times.

Please introduce a bill, or give a speech, or do something. If this continues, I really won't be able to remember who you are.

### Identifying Jewelry

— Ji Yun

This newspaper reports that diamond lottery tickets are about to be issued, and experts have identified and evaluated the prices of the confiscated property in detail. A friend occasionally mentioned that it is not easy to identify treasures. Mr. Wang, who was present at the time, said that assessing the value is definitely not something that those who are not familiar with market conditions can do. If it is only to distinguish between true and false, it is still simple, so he described the method of identification. Mr. Wang is experienced in the pawnshop business, so his words may not be wrong. A brief record is as follows:

Gemstones: Dip a bamboo strip in water and put it on the gemstone. If the water floats on top and spreads out and flows unevenly, it is fake. If it does not spread and gathers like a dewdrop, it is real.

Jadeite: Use a gold tool to grind it. If gold filings can be ground out, it is real. Otherwise, it is fake.

Agate: Grind the agate into powder. If it is not hot, it is real. If it gets hot, it is fake.

Amber: Rub the amber in the palm of your hand until it gets hot. If it can stick to mustard seeds, it is real. Otherwise, it is fake.

Pearls: Place the pearl in a dark room and stand far away to look at it. If it can emit a faint light, it is real. If it is dark and grayish, it is fake.

Crystal: Use Ruizhou fire stone to grind it. If it does not leave any traces, it is real. Otherwise, it is fake.

Ivory: If the grain is natural and curved, it is real. If the grain is clear and straight, it is fake. Also, if it does not change color when coated with sulfuric acid, it is real. If it changes to bamboo stone color, it is fake.

The above points are questioned by contemporary appraisers, is it true or not.

### Thinking About Rickshaws

— Suo Bei

I have always admired the fearless spirit of "rickshaw kuangsheng" (a popular respectful term for drivers). Under the circumstances of being attacked by vehicles from all sides, "Mr. Rickshaw" can often disregard his own safety and boldly stop the rickshaw with a wave of his arm and make a big turn. His spirit of seeing death as returning home and serving bravely is indeed not easy. Unfortunately, once this spirit is "extended to others," passengers are often left in a state of shock and are in mortal danger. For example, when a large truck is about to devour them, "Mr. Rickshaw" recklessly pushes the front half of the rickshaw through, as if the passenger's life in the back half of the rickshaw is none of his business. Thus, the passenger is the first to be sacrificed. Not long ago, on Seymour Road, a rickshaw that was running rampant suddenly braked. As the rickshaw shook, a female passenger happened to fall under the wheels of a trolleybus and was decapitated!

Even so, the popularity of rickshaws has not waned, and it was once called "mandarin duck affairs," which shows that there are many brave passengers in Shanghai. Therefore, after the currency change, all prices were frozen, but rickshaw fares jumped several times. What used to cost 400,000 yuan now costs at least four jiao. It is not uncommon to ask for more than one yuan for slightly longer distances. What's more, these "Mr. Rickshaws" are strict and selfless, with the same work ethic as the meat vendors in the vegetable market. I don't like to see their "faces," especially when it's raining heavily or the wind is blowing. So I only take rickshaws occasionally, and always on sunny days. During strong winds and rain, I would rather sacrifice my clothes and wait for the tram because I hate the bamboo tapping of "taking advantage of others' misfortunes"!

In the past, the catchphrases of "Mr. Rickshaw" were: How much does a pancake cost? How much does rice sell for? Now, pancakes still cost 60,000 legal tender each, and household rice prices have not changed in February. The rickshaw fares have not changed, why do the fares still rise like this? In the past, rickshaw fares were about 10% higher than buses or trams. When tram and bus fares went up, they followed suit. But now, not only have tram and bus fares not risen, but rickshaw fares have soared several times! What is particularly noteworthy is that this phenomenon of sky-high prices has not stopped to this day. In recent weeks, every two or three days, rickshaw fares are bound to be higher than the previous two or three days.

What is the reason for this? The only reason "Mr. Rickshaw" has is that the police fines have increased. But does that mean they get fined every day? Recently, I read in the newspaper that the police have reduced fines because of this. But will that be enough to lower the high prices that they have become accustomed to? Probably not.

In fact, the problem is that "if you don't ride, there will be someone else who will." Just like in the vegetable market, as long as you hide them and don't sell, the customers will succumb: "Okay, okay, the price will be as you say."

This phenomenon is caused by a few wealthy consumers who don't care and don't haggle. Thus, "asking for sky-high prices" is unrestrained, and the black market has emerged in response.
