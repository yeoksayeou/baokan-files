[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a luncheon at his official residence on the 30th for Zhang Qun, Yu Hongjun, Yu Dawei, Weng Wenhao, and Shen Yi, seeking their advice and holding discussions. According to well-informed sources, Wei Demai (Wedemeyer) recently sent a document to Chairman Chiang, offering suggestions on finance, resources, transportation, and other matters. The document included proposals for reforming our currency system, developing resources, and constructing transportation infrastructure, with particular emphasis on improving water conservancy in South China. After receiving the document, Chairman Chiang immediately instructed experts to formulate opinions. It is reported that the issues discussed at the Chairman's luncheon on the 30th were related to this matter. Late in the evening, reporters selectively inquired with the attendees, but they were unwilling to disclose any information, although they did not deny it either.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] On the 28th, Secretary of State Marshall held his first direct, formal discussion with the head of our technical delegation, Bei Zuyi, regarding the US aid to China plan. The plan is currently under review by President Truman's National Advisory Council. It is expected that the plan, after undergoing the necessary review by the Bureau of the Budget, will be finalized in the short term. Subsequently, it will be submitted to President Truman for final approval, after which Truman will submit the plan to Congress, possibly with a special message requesting prompt passage. However, it is not yet known when the plan can be completed and passed, or the details of the procedures by the Bureau of the Budget and Truman. No information is available regarding the nature of the plan and when it will be submitted to Congress.

[Further Dispatch] Premier Zhang Qun's statement on China's ten economic reform plans was published by various newspapers in Washington on the 29th, but without comment. The Washington Post's headline was "China Proposes Self-Help Plan." The Times Herald reported "China Guarantees Fiscal Reform." None of the newspapers published the full text. Furthermore, when a reporter inquired with Marshall about Premier Zhang's plan, he declined to comment, but said that the ten plans would be considered, without providing detailed explanations.

### Our Country Should Pay Close Attention to the US Economic Recovery Plan for Japan; Committee of Participating Councilors Passes Important Motions at Regular Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Committee of Participating Councilors of the National Political Council held a regular meeting on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Mo Dehui. First, the Secretariat read a written report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the content of the report can be found in another article). Then, Gu Zhenggang was invited to report on the recent social administration facilities and the situation of refugee relief. Subsequently, the committee discussed and passed the following motions:

*   Yu Nanqiu and others proposed that the government adjust the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants monthly according to the cost of living index and maintain the original in-kind allocation method to increase work efficiency.
*   Wu Xu and others proposed that the government reconsider the in-kind allocation method for public school teachers and civil servants. It was resolved that the above two motions would be discussed together and forwarded to the government for attention.
*   Wu Zhaoxu and others proposed: That the government promptly adopt effective measures that address both the symptoms and the root causes to salvage the crisis in North China and win back popular support. It was resolved to pass the motion and forward it to the government for prompt action (the measures are listed in another article).
*   Wu Zhaoxu and others proposed: That the government instruct the Executive Yuan to reconsider the return of the ownership of the Mentougou coal mine. It was resolved to pass the motion and forward it to the government, instructing the Executive Yuan to carefully consider it.
*   Yu Nanqiu and others proposed that the government pay close attention to the US economic recovery plan for Japan. The resolution was amended and passed, requesting the government to pay close attention. (The motion pointed out: Before the peace treaty is finalized, we should not unilaterally and actively support the enemy country. Passively maintaining the livelihood and developing light industry in Japan is acceptable, but actively restoring it to pre-war levels, especially producing three million tons of steel annually, is tantamount to arming Japan. If this matter is realized, then the United Nations will have been placed outside the equation by the United States. How can this be allowed! It is proposed that the government instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay close attention and report to this committee at any time with any concerning developments.)

Regarding the selection of members of the Executive Yuan's Special Donation Supervision Committee to participate in the National Political Council, Lu Qian, Jiang Yong, and Jin Weixi were selected.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Submits a Written Report to the Committee of Participating Councilors

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The written report submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Committee of Participating Councilors is roughly divided into four points:

*   The Kowloon and Shamian incidents are currently under negotiation between China and the United Kingdom. Our government is demanding the release of the arrested residents in Kowloon. Regarding the Shamian incident, the Ministry of Interior has sent personnel to investigate. Regarding the losses suffered by foreigners, they will be handled in accordance with international practice after a thorough investigation.
*   The process of signing the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement.
*   The situation of handling the return of overseas Chinese from the Federation of Malaya and Singapore. After consultations and agreement between the two parties, 8,000 overseas Chinese from the Federation of Malaya and 6,000 from Singapore will be repatriated. The first batch of 3,000 overseas Chinese returning to Singapore will have their entry procedures processed in early February.
*   Regarding the mediation of the Indonesian conflict, we have decided to send ten military officers from the Ministry of National Defense to Batavia to participate in the Allied mediation. The Ministry of National Defense is currently studying suitable candidates.

After these measures are approved by the Political Affairs Conference, they will be promulgated to local governments for implementation.

### Sino-British Negotiations Show No Development

### It Will Take Half a Year to Transport the American Ships Purchased by Our Country

[Central News Agency, Manila, 29th] According to Rear Admiral Moore, commander of the US Naval Base at Subic Bay in Zambales Province, it will take at least one year for the Chinese government to completely transport back the surplus US Navy ships and other floating equipment that it recently purchased from the US Foreign Liquidation Commission in Manila.

### Lin Chongyong Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing to Discuss the Concentration of Large Amounts of Capital in Hankou and to Consult with the President of the National Bank of China on How to Use It

[Our Newspaper] Lin Chongyong, Director of the Hankou Financial Management Bureau, arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on the 27th of this month, met with the authorities to report on the establishment of the bureau in Hankou, and arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 30th after completing his official business. Lin told reporters that his mission in Shanghai was to meet with President Zhang and Vice President Liu of the National Bank of China to consult on how to use the large amount of capital in Hankou to put it on the right track and to ensure reasonable protection for productive enterprises. After the establishment of the Hankou Financial Management Bureau, it shut down 47 illegal private banks. In order to facilitate the aggregation and management of funds, the three clearing houses in Hankou were merged into one. There are a total of 58 banks in Hankou, including national banks, 38 legal private banks, and 21 private banks temporarily permitted to operate by the Ministry of Finance. The exchange volume of various banks and private banks at the National Bank of China used to be 60 billion per day, but it has now increased to about 300 billion. The daily interest rate for loans used to be 9 or 10 yuan, but after management, it has now fallen to 7 yuan. The daily interest rate for Class A current deposits used to be 4 yuan, but it has now fallen to 2 yuan or 1 yuan. The deposits of various banks and private banks in the National Bank of China this month are about three times that of last month, and the concentration of funds is a good phenomenon. The task ahead is to guide funds into normal channels. (Continued in column 1, page 2)

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 30th] A large amount of floating capital from the Northeast is flowing into Tianjin and then being transferred to Shanghai and Hong Kong. The Tianjin Financial Management Bureau has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request instructions on preventing the inflow of capital from the Northeast into Tianjin.

### Indian Spiritual Leader Gandhi Assassinated; When the News Broke, Indians Wept Aloud; The Flames of War Are Likely to Spread Throughout India

[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] Indian spiritual leader Gandhi was shot three or four times in the chest by an assassin on his way to a prayer meeting at 5:00 PM Indian Standard Time on the 30th and died on the spot. The assassin was a young man who fired at Gandhi from a very close range. About 500 people were waiting for Gandhi to speak at the prayer meeting. Gandhi walked from his residence, the Birla House, to the wooden platform for speeches in the prayer meeting, supported by his two granddaughters. When the crowd saw Gandhi arrive, they stepped aside to make way. Suddenly, a young man, aged between 20 and 30, wearing a khaki uniform, drew a gun from his waist and fired four shots at Gandhi. Because the incident happened so suddenly, the crowd did not immediately understand what had happened. They only saw that Gandhi's white shirt was stained with blood from his neck to his abdomen. Some women fainted in shock, while others rushed to support Gandhi. Some of the braver women held Gandhi tightly until the police arrived.

When the news broke, the entire Delhi was shocked. Nehru and other cabinet members, as well as Indian Governor-General Mountbatten, immediately received the bad news by telephone. Shops in Delhi were smashed as soon as the news of the death was heard. A large number of troops and police were dispatched to maintain order in the city. People from all walks of life gathered in the streets, and some wept aloud. In front of the Birla House, the crowd was packed, and some shouted "Down with the Muslim murderers!" However, the authorities have not yet announced the identity of the assassin.

[United Press, New Delhi, 30th] After Gandhi's death, his body was even thinner than after his hunger strike. The assassin of Gandhi is believed to be an extremist of the Indian race, possibly belonging to a faction opposed to Gandhi's movement to promote peace between India and Muslims. With Gandhi's death, the flames of war may spread throughout India, and the two races of India and Muslims will inevitably kill each other.

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 30th] According to eyewitnesses, the assassin of Gandhi mingled with people in the prayer meeting. He was short, wore a khaki uniform, and did not attract attention. The uniform may have been purchased from a store selling surplus US military supplies. He suddenly pulled out a pistol and quickly fired three shots, hitting Gandhi's vital organs. (All news about Gandhi's assassination is published on page 3.)

### Sun Liren Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] General Sun Liren, Commander of the Army Training Command, flew from Taiwan to Shanghai at 3:50 PM yesterday. He will go to Nanjing in the next few days for instructions and return to his post a week later. According to Sun's aides, the current goal of military training in Taiwan is still to strengthen the coordination of various departments and improve the standard of the army. There are no plans for organizational changes. There are currently more than ten US military officers and soldiers in Taiwan, acting entirely as advisors to assist our country's training work. Regarding the speculation that the US advisory group plans to train new soldiers for us, there is no new information to report, and in fact, the US itself has not yet made a decision on this policy. Regarding the report by a foreign news agency that a Taiwanese guerrilla force attacked the National Army in Taichung, it is completely unfounded.

### Our Government and the Public Express Shock; Dean Dai Pens a Eulogy in Tears; Dean Yu Also Writes a Short Essay to Express Condolences

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] After the news of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi reached this city, people in the capital expressed extreme shock. Dean Dai Chuanxian deeply mourned and wrote a eulogy: "Ancient country of ten thousand years, gave birth to a great sage, saving people and the world, sacrificing life. People's hearts do not return, heaven's will is uncertain, alas Mr.! Benevolence and righteousness are exhausted." After writing, he could not stop his tears. The original eulogy will be handed over to the Nanjing Central Daily for printing and publication. Dean Yu Youren was also extremely saddened by the news and wrote a short essay to express his condolences: "A most benevolent and compassionate Gandhi died tragically in broad daylight. I mourn for the humanity of the world. Tagore said: 'Gandhi is another name for sacrifice.' It is known that sacrifice is Gandhi's spirit, and the world has long recognized Gandhi as a saint of sacrifice. So, is Gandhi's assassination a success or a failure? I say: Gandhi's spirit can also be compared to the world, so that people in the world seeking freedom, independence, peace, and democracy will gain a kind of awakening, and the future of India will inevitably have many Gandhis rising up to act?" Zhang Daofan had accompanied Chairman Chiang on a visit to India and was very familiar with Gandhi. He expressed great shock and grief after hearing the news. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao said in response to an inquiry from this newspaper that he had also learned of the bad news from a broadcast in the Philippines. Our government is extremely shocked and saddened by this. Gandhi was the spiritual leader of all the people of India, representing the soul of India. Now, in the midst of national division and turmoil, this great change has occurred, and he has sacrificed his life for peace, which is truly regrettable. India is our country's fraternal nation, and Gandhi's spiritual model is admired by the world. Although the truth of the assassination is not yet known, in any case, we sincerely hope that our brothers in all of India, regardless of India and Muslims, will deeply understand the unfinished ambitions of the eternal Gandhi, and urgently hope for peace and stability. As soon as our Ministry of Foreign Affairs receives a confirmed report, it will send a telegram of condolences.

### The Four-Province Pacification Conference Concludes; Key Officials from Various Provinces Will Return to Their Posts Today; After the Bandits in the Tongguan-Luoyang Area Are Cleared, Transportation Will Resume

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 30th] The Four-Province Pacification Conference concluded satisfactorily on the afternoon of the 30th. Concrete decisions were made regarding military and political coordination, regional suppression, and the division of powers between provinces and pacification zones. The provincial chairmen and pacification zone commanders attending the meeting rested only after 2 AM every night for the past three days, demonstrating the intensity of the work. A grand entertainment evening was held at the Xuzhou Army Headquarters on the evening of the 30th. Also, Nian Feipeng arrived in Xuzhou from Nanjing on the morning of the 29th to attend the Pacification Conference.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th] The matter of abolishing the Wuhan Headquarters and establishing a Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Central China is getting closer to reality. It is widely rumored that Zhen Jingtong will be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Headquarters, a statement that is somewhat consistent with Xu Zuyi's remarks.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 30th] Headquarters News: The 164th Brigade of Pan Wenhua's troops has increased defenses in Shashi, and there is no fear for the defense of the Yangtze River. Pan recently came to Chongqing from Yichang, and he is seriously ill and refused to see visitors.

[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 29th] Tang Enbo inspected the troops stationed in Zhengzhou and inspected the city defenses on the 29th.

### Dong XianGuang's Speech

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After learning of the sad news of Gandhi's assassination, Director of the Executive Yuan's News Bureau, Dong XianGuang, issued the following statement:

The Chinese government deeply felt shocked and grieved about this bad news. This spiritual leader of this generation had just said goodbye to us while the world needed his hard work. The loss of this leader is a great blow to the Indian people at the time when India's freedom struggle is about to be completed. Gandhi was the creator of India's freedom. If India did not have his wise leadership and selfless sacrifice, I am afraid that its political achievements would be far less than today. Gandhi himself was the symbol of the highest ideals of his nation. Gandhi died at the time when he led the people to make the final struggle for unity. His spirit of sacrificing for the country and the nation is a great example for mankind. All Chinese people mourned after hearing this sad news, because Gandhi was a great Asian, and his ideals were eternal lessons for all ages.

### The "Alliance" between China and the Philippines Has Been Denied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied on the 30th that a certain senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hinted in a report from Manila Radio that China and the Philippines would form an "alliance" in the near future. The spokesperson commented on this matter and said: "We have never heard of anything like that."

### Our Immigration to the United States This Year Has Not Yet Reached the Quota

A US State Department Official Declares

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] A US State Department official said that as of June 30, the annual immigration quota from China had not been met. According to immigration regulations, the annual immigration quota allocated to China is 105, of which 75% is set aside for Chinese immigrants from China, and the remaining 25% is for overseas Chinese around the world, including Hong Kong. The official said that for undisclosed reasons, very few Chinese people enter the United States under the quota, while on the other hand, there are a large number of applications from overseas Chinese to be included in the quota. It is estimated that there will be no vacancies to be filled by applicants within five years.

### Civil Servants Continue to Receive Rations of Coal, Sugar, Oil, Salt, and Cloth

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Regarding the issue of rationing daily necessities, according to news from the Ministry of Economic Affairs:

*   The method of rationing daily necessities to public school teachers and civil servants has changed slightly. Starting in February, each person will receive three dou of rice per month at no cost. In the past, eight dou were rationed at a fixed price. The rationing of coal, sugar, oil, salt, and cloth will continue to be carried out in accordance with past methods.
*   Grain from US aid supplies will be rationed at a fixed price starting on March 1. Rationing to all city residents and public school teachers and civil servants is also being considered.
*   The method of expanding the scope of rationing daily necessities beyond public school teachers and civil servants to the cultural sector, and even to city residents, was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and has been sent to the National Economic Commission for review. However, the commission, in view of the fact that the work will be extraordinarily complicated after the scope of rationing is expanded, and that it will be difficult to fully control the materials, has shelved the plan.

### Guangzhou Headquarters Approves Plan to Jointly Suppress Communist Bandits on Hainan Island

### The Legislative Yuan Will Reconvene on February 5; Will Discuss the Issue of Adjusting the Salaries of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants Again; Liu Zhiping Writes to Premier Zhang Qun to Bitterly Complain About the Improper Measures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Legislative Yuan adjourned for a month in January and is now scheduled to reconvene on February 5. When the first general meeting of the Legislative Yuan this year is held, the issue of adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants will be discussed again. The adjustment method decided by the Executive Yuan this time is very different from the initial recommendations of the Legislative Yuan. Some legislators believe that they cannot remain silent and once gathered to nominate the original proposer, Liu Zhiping, to write to Executive Yuan Premier Zhang Qun, bitterly complaining about the inappropriateness of this method. When the Legislative Yuan meets on the 5th, it will also conduct detailed research based on the opinions of various committees. The main points of Liu's letter to Premier Zhang are as follows:

Regarding salaries, the base salary of 30 yuan for civil and military officials is already quite low, but prices are galloping like wild horses, and the cost of living index has been stuck at the same number for three or four months. Is it possible for them not to worry about food, clothing, housing, and transportation? I believe that the salary paid by the government to public school teachers and civil servants should at least enable them to "maintain integrity." Otherwise, those officials with poor learning and ability will inevitably be corrupt if they get the opportunity.

The purchase of daily necessities should not be cancelled. I believe that if the government wants to equalize the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants in various places, it may gradually expand the rationing method to provinces and cities other than Beijing and Shanghai.

Regarding the wages of workers, the Executive Yuan's adjusted number this time actually assessed the original wages of technicians at a maximum of 40 yuan and a minimum of 20 yuan, and the wages of laborers at a maximum of 18 yuan and a minimum of 6 yuan. This is extremely unreasonable, because the higher wages of technicians are due to years of diligent service, which has increased each time it is tested. Now the government is erasing the achievements of their past work and reducing them all at once, which is unfair and should be quickly remedied.

Please consider carefully the downsizing of the organization. The trend of using people for private gain should be eliminated first, and those with concurrent positions should be laid off first. All those qualified to be civil servants should be registered, and if the government implements downsizing, it must have a thorough plan beforehand and must never add people while laying off people.

I know very well that an increase in the treatment of civil and military officials may mean an increase in the burden on the common people, but even if the government does not increase the burden on the common people, there are still ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The so-called increase in revenue is not an increase in taxes, but the most important thing is to requisition the domestic and foreign properties and deposits of large and small corrupt officials. The so-called reduction in expenditure, the most important thing is still to severely punish corruption and not let most of the people's hard-earned money flow into the private pockets of corrupt officials.

The Premier should think about the clean civil and military officials and improve their work efficiency. He should not let them live a life of starvation. I hope that the Premier can quickly come up with a way to change this situation and no longer make the civil and military officials across the country complain.

### National Army in Jinbei Enters Hunyuan

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th] The Datong National Army attacked Hunyuan on the 26th of Zhen He's troops, and the progress was rapid. The bandits were overwhelmed and defeated. By noon on the 27th, they had defeated the bandits entrenched in the county and entered the county seat.

### Reduction of the Northeast Headquarters' Scope: Chairman Chiang's Telegram Orders Wei Lihuang to be Responsible for All Military Affairs; Fan Hanjie Flies to Beiping via Jinan to Shenyang

[Our newspaper, Jiyang, 30th dispatch] The Northeast Headquarters has decided to reduce its scope, taking on the responsibility of administrative and economic supervision and command. In addition to the Director's Office, it will have three groups: the first group will be in charge of military affairs, headed by Chief of Staff Dong Yingbin; the second group will be in charge of political affairs, headed by Deputy Chief of Staff Dong Yanping; and the third group will be the secretariat, headed by Secretary-General Peng Jiqun. The number of personnel at the headquarters will be reduced from several thousand to four or five hundred. The headquarters will move to the First Guest House for its offices. The entire original headquarters building will be occupied by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Another adjacent building, formerly the site of the Chief's Office, is now the Political Affairs Council.

[Another dispatch] The Chairman recently telegraphed the local Standing Committee, stating that Wei Lihuang is responsible for all military affairs and troop reorganization and assessment in the Northeast. According to a military official who spoke to reporters, the situation in the Northeast today is not one of earth-shattering change, but a serious and arduous problem awaiting our resolution.

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 30th dispatch] Fan Hanjie, with his children and entourage, flew from Nanjing to Beiping this morning. He landed in Jinan for eighty minutes and arrived in Beiping at 2:40 PM. After disembarking, he immediately went to Yimuyuan for a banquet hosted by Wu Qihwei. In the afternoon, he went to the headquarters to visit Li Zongren. Fan will stay in Beiping for one or two days before going to Jinan. According to Gan Peilin, Chief of Staff of the headquarters, Fan's mission in Jiaodong has come to an end. As Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, he will be transferred to the Beining Railway. No separate organization will be established there, and his First Army Corps has already arrived at its designated new defense area.

[Another dispatch] Part of the bandit forces at Jinzhou on the Beining Railway are gathering from Xinlitun and Dahushan towards the Goubangzi area. On the night of the 28th, they invaded and occupied Goubangzi. The defending troops retreated westward to Shishan Station. Currently, the bandits have completed a cross-sectional force in Beizhen, Goubangzi, and Panshan on the Xiaoying'an Line, and are blocking the National Army's reinforcements.

[Our newspaper, Tianjin, 30th dispatch] The direct passenger train service on the Tianjin-Jinzhou section of the Beining Railway has been interrupted for over a month. The Railway Bureau has recently decided to resume service from February 1st.

[United Press, Beiping, 30th dispatch] Shenyang report: The highest leaders of the Communist bandits in the Northeast held a meeting in Boli, Jilin. Lin Biao and Li Lisan attended. The meeting resolved to expand the Communist bandits in the Northeast this summer and equip them with mechanized forces. It is said that the Communist bandits have decided to organize another 300,000 mobile troops, plus three support teams, and a mechanized army division and two assault detachments.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 30th dispatch] The National Army's Shi Jue unit, after defeating the main force of the Bandit Army's 14th Military District in Xinglong, entered Gubeikou with elite troops and is now deploying between Miyun and Tongzhou to eliminate the remaining bandits. The Pinggu Road is becoming increasingly stable, and trains and military vehicles pass daily without hindrance. The counties along the road are expanding construction work with the support of the National Army.

Editorial

### American Loans to China and the Opening of Inland Waterway Navigation Rights

The plan for American loans to China is currently under discussion in Washington. Secretary of State Marshall and Mr. Bei Zuyi of the Chinese Technical Mission have met several times. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan has also announced ten self-help reform plans, indicating that American loans are gradually becoming a reality. The Chinese government and people are naturally grateful for the goodwill of our American friends. However, the English-language "China Daily News" recently published an editorial entitled "How to Make American Loans Effective," proposing the opening of China's inland waterway navigation rights as a condition for American loans, which we cannot remain silent about.

The "China Daily News" editorial argues that China should first implement various internal reforms before the United States provides loans. Otherwise, past loans have been a waste, and future loans will still be a waste, and China's self-help ability will be further hindered. Our government should accept these suggestions. However, the newspaper's proposal to open inland waterway navigation rights, as stated in its original text, "China must abide by international practices regarding inland waterway transport. Currently, due to the interests of a few Chinese shipping merchants, abnormal restrictions are imposed on foreign ships, which not only weaken China's transport convenience but also increase transport costs," makes us feel as if we are not living in the modern era. Has the equal new treaty between China, the United States, and Britain become a worthless piece of paper?

The "China Daily News" is a newspaper run by Americans. Although its views may not represent the unanimous opinion of the American government and people, it clearly points out that it is the consensus of the American business community in China and a carefully considered conclusion. If so, we believe that the minds of the foreign "taipans" in Shanghai of the 19th century need to be changed.

China does need loans and foreign aid to carry out its work of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. We will deeply thank anyone who sympathizes with us and helps us, and we are willing to work hard to be worthy of our friendly countries. However, we will never accept preconditions that interfere with our internal affairs or humiliate our country. Hasn't the US State Department repeatedly stated that American aid to Europe and China will not interfere in other countries' internal affairs or infringe upon their sovereignty? American businessmen in China are well aware of the Chinese situation. How can they not understand the US policy towards China? In recent years, they have mistakenly equated state-owned enterprises with bureaucracy and corruption, and have repeatedly advocated preventing the expansion of state-owned enterprises. They have also advocated restricting the power of trade associations and amending the provisions of the Factory Law. Aren't these interventions in our internal affairs? They openly advocate opening inland waterway navigation rights, isn't that infringing upon our country's sovereignty? As for their reasons for opening inland waterway navigation rights, they really do not "understand the Chinese situation" and are even distorting the truth and confusing public opinion.

We believe that opening inland waterway navigation rights infringes upon sovereignty, but they insist that it is an international practice. If it were an international practice, the Qing government would not have had to solemnly list the opening of inland waterway navigation rights in the treaty when signing unequal treaties, and we would not have had to write the abolition of inland waterway navigation rights into the treaty when we abolished unequal treaties later. Even if we take ten thousand steps back, even if the opening of inland waterway navigation rights is indeed an international practice, countries with infant industries also need to implement protection policies. Whether or not to adopt customary practices is our prerogative. All human beings are originally equal, but it is extremely unfair to force a child to fight an adult. In the past, Britain and Japan, with their superior financial resources, expanded their shipping businesses in China. With the weakness of Chinese shipping merchants, they could not withstand their attacks. Moreover, there was the so-called Yangtze Conference, which used its power to suppress smaller shipping merchants, preventing them from rising. At that time, Yangtze River shipping was almost entirely controlled by British and Japanese foreign firms. Therefore, during the period when unequal treaties existed, China's shipping industry could not develop. After the victory, when navigation rights were recovered, in just over two short years, the tonnage of Chinese ships jumped from the remaining 100,000 tons to over 900,000 tons, and it is still continuing to increase. This should be regarded by our friendly country, the United States, as the best example of China's self-help. If you really want to help China with construction, you should give China's shipping industry the opportunity to develop and designate part of the loan for the purchase and construction of ships to enhance China's transportation capacity. You shouldn't just be acting as a pawn for the British and making the opening of inland waterway navigation rights a prerequisite for the loan.

Now that the tonnage of Chinese ships has reached over 900,000 tons, it is safe to say that there is sufficient capacity for transportation along inland rivers and coastal waters, and even overseas transportation can be undertaken in part. The recent transportation of Japanese reparations materials and the transportation of Hainan Island minerals to Japan by the Chinese shipping industry is clear evidence of this. This is a contribution of the Chinese shipping industry to the country to obtain foreign exchange to meet urgent needs, and it should also be sympathized with by our friendly country, the United States. In the past, the reason why China's foreign trade was often in deficit was because of the high freight and insurance costs for exported goods, which consumed a significant amount of foreign exchange. If China could transport its own goods to foreign countries, and the goods sold to foreign countries were not F.O.B. Shanghai but C.I.F. New York or London, then international trade would not be too much in deficit. Some foreign businessmen blame the shrinkage of current exports solely on the lack of transportation tools. This is also a deliberate excuse and not the true reality. The shrinkage of exports need not be denied, but the biggest reason is still the technical issues of foreign exchange listing and export management, which is a well-known problem. Secondly, there is the obstruction of inland transportation. The inland areas have been disrupted by the Communist bandits, and transportation has been completely destroyed, so various exportable local products cannot be concentrated at the ports. Although the current ships have been requisitioned by the government for many missions, there is still more than enough to maintain commercial transport along the Yangtze River and the coast. Currently, there is not a shortage of ships for the goods, but a shortage of goods for the ships. We know that many British merchant ships sailing on inland rivers have already been transferred to Chinese merchants, and some have even nominally hung the Chinese flag. The United States originally did not have ships sailing on inland rivers, and there is no possibility of increasing transportation tools now. The "China Daily News" said that this "weakens China's transport convenience," but we don't know what they mean by that.

The increase in transportation costs is also a fact, but may we ask if other public utilities have increased? Even the public utilities run by British and American legal entities, such as electricity, telephone, tap water, gas, streetcars, and buses, have all increased monthly, and the extent of their increase is probably even greater than the increase in ship fares. Each time they increase their prices, they always use the high prices of oil, coal, materials, the cost of living index for employees, and the exchange rate as reasons. Doesn't the operation of ships have to be affected by these factors? According to our statistics, the increase in fares has not kept pace with the prices. Try comparing the fares at the end of 1946 with the fares at the end of 1947. How many times have they increased? Then compare the price index at the end of 1946 with the price index at the end of 1947. How many times have they increased? Then you will know that our judgment is not fabricated out of thin air. It is hard to believe that if foreign ships sailed on inland rivers, the fares would drop, because foreign ships would also be affected by the prices of oil, coal, materials, the cost of living index for employees, and the exchange rate. Even if we compare the current freight costs between Shanghai and Hong Kong, the freight charges of British merchant ships are not only no lower than those of Chinese merchants, but are much higher. According to our investigation, the freight charges for Chinese merchants shipping goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong are only 1.2 million yuan per ton, while British merchants require HK$112, and also require Hong Kong drafts. Otherwise, even if calculated at the black market rate, it would be about three times higher than that of Chinese merchants. Therefore, the "China Daily News"'s statement that it "increases transport costs" is not credible at all. If foreign merchants, in order to suppress Chinese merchants, continue to use the old tricks of the former "Yangtze Conference" to achieve the goal of dominating China's shipping industry, this is a "trust" tactic. How can our China, which follows the Three Principles of the People, allow this? The "China Daily News" opposes monopolies. Why does it particularly favor the return of British shipping merchants and not see this? If it is for the sake of the United States itself, then the former Russell & Company is a precedent. There is no need to compete with British shipping merchants.

In short, China certainly needs loans, but it needs international sympathy even more. China certainly needs foreign aid, but it needs to maintain its own sovereignty even more. Otherwise, if diplomacy goes astray and sovereignty is once again lost, it will arouse the people's indignation. We hope our government will pay attention!

### Lin Chongyong Talks to Reporters About the Crackdown on Illegal Financial Institutions in Hankou

(Continued from page one) Regarding the handling of illegal financial institutions, Lin said: These illegal financial institutions were all established after the victory, due to the laissez-faire attitude of the managers and the government's failure to fully implement laws and regulations at that time. These financial institutions have considerable financial resources and specialize in speculative trading, driving up prices, which greatly harms people's livelihoods. According to the total capital in Hankou, it is only 400 billion, and more than half of it is in the hands of illegal financial institutions. They also openly have an exchange in the Money Industry Association, with a daily exchange volume of over 200 billion. Legal and licensed financial institutions have another exchange in Zhengtai Financial Institution, with an exchange volume of only 100 billion. The legal commercial banks only have an exchange volume of 60 billion per day in the exchange of the National Bank. After the establishment of this bureau, the first thing it did was to merge the two exchanges into the exchange of the National Bank to unify authority and facilitate management. The execution of this plan initially aroused resentment, but now it has gradually subsided. The good influence of this move is obvious. Prices have gradually stabilized as a result. For example, white rice, which originally sold for 1.05 million per dan, has now fallen to 920,000. Currently, more than half of the closed financial institutions have applied for liquidation procedures. The deadline for application has been set for February 9. General Cheng Qian, director of the Wuhan Headquarters, is also very concerned about the handling of these follow-up matters. In addition to cracking down on the activities of illegal financial institutions, the work of the Gold Management Bureau also includes cracking down on the illegal business of legal financial institutions.

### Chongqing Tobacco Industry Representatives Arrive in Nanjing to Petition for Tax Reduction

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 30th dispatch] Chongqing cigarette manufacturers, due to the excessive tax increase by the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, have sent representatives Zhou Wuquan and Zhang Keqiang to Nanjing to petition. They held a reception for reporters on the evening of the 30th to explain the purpose of the petition, saying that the first tax increase of the 37th year by the Taxation Administration was particularly heavy in the Chongqing area, with an average tax increase of 300%. Other areas and foreign companies only increased by 100%. The government provides British and American tobacco companies with raw materials such as cigarette paper and tin foil at official prices in four installments per year, and also provides preferential measures such as "official fixed market price foreign exchange," "low-interest loans," and "tax account credit." The factories in Chongqing lack the above-mentioned preferential treatment. Now the factories in Chongqing are facing the biggest crisis. They hope that the government can quickly improve the tax system, reduce the tax rate, and provide fair treatment so as to maintain their survival and avoid the serious social problem of unemployment for more than 100,000 people. They visited Director Jiang Shuge of the Taxation Administration on the 30th and explained everything. Jiang expressed great sympathy, but said that the tax rate was determined by legislative procedures and could be requested to the relevant parties when the tax is increased next month. They will continue to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance on the 31st.

### Qingdao Industry Petition Delegation Arrives in Nanjing to Call for Five Matters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th dispatch] The Qingdao Industry Petition Delegation, consisting of Yin Zhizhong, Nian Mingting, and four others, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 30th. They will request the Executive Yuan's Economic Affairs, Social Affairs, and Finance Departments, as well as the National Resources Commission, to supply fuel, increase the foreign exchange limit, and open production loans. The delegation held a reception for the press at 4 PM today. Delegation leader Yin Zhizhong reported on the current difficulties of Qingdao's industry, stating: "There are currently a total of 1,266 factories in Qingdao, which is half of the peak period in the past. Less than 40% of the existing factories are operating, and some of them are still half-operating or intermittent. On the eve of the Lunar New Year, the industrial sector is really unable to continue to maintain the difficult situation. Therefore, we have come to Nanjing to appeal and request: 1. To approve a 50% reduction in all taxes. 2. To request the Fuel Management Committee to allocate 20,000 tons of coal per month for industrial use. 3. To request the opening of north-south wheat transportation. 4. To request the opening of production loans and the issuance of 150 billion yuan of emergency loans to Qingdao City before the Lunar New Year. 5. To increase the foreign exchange limit to 2 million US dollars."

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 30th dispatch] The Beiping-Tianjin Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group officially concluded on the 30th and held its final group meeting. Chief Supervisor Li Si and various committee members told reporters that the group has been established for more than five months and has received a total of 3,024 documents.

### Remains of Two Military Officers Who Died in Siam Will be Returned for Burial

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 30th dispatch] The remains of two of our military officers who infiltrated Siam in 1944 under the instructions of the British military authorities stationed in Kandy (in Ceylon) and those responsible for economic warfare and were killed have been transported from southern Siam to this place in order to be transported back to the motherland for burial. These two heroes are Major Guo Riren (32 years old, Cambridge University graduate) and Captain Ma Kewu (30 years old, Army University graduate). They were ordered by our government to assist the British military in Kandy in planning the offensive against Siam and Malaya. They flew to the sea near Phang-nga (in southern Siam) at dawn one day in 1944 with two soldiers, weapons, and a radio in a seaplane, and then landed in a rubber boat. However, in a hurry, they forgot to bring drinking water, so they entered a village in search of water under the pressure of thirst and were discovered. The local police and soldiers did not know their identities, so they surrounded their camp in the night and soon shot the two heroes to death one after another. Their bodies were buried on the beach, and the other two soldiers were arrested and imprisoned. They took the opportunity to return to the country after the war.

### Implementation Details for the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Approval of Cotton Purchase and Yarn Distribution

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee drafted six implementation details to achieve the goals of unified purchase and unified sales through contracted spinning and contracted weaving. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now approved two items: cotton purchase and yarn distribution. The details are as follows:

(A) Implementation Details for Cotton Purchase: These details are formulated in accordance with Articles 2 and 8 of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations. This Committee will establish agencies in major cotton collecting and distributing markets and cotton-consuming areas throughout the country to purchase cotton. When necessary, it may designate areas and entrust other institutions and cotton yarn millers' trade associations to handle purchasing matters on its behalf. The purchase price of cotton will be determined by this Committee based on the cost of cotton production, quality, transportation, and other factors in various regions. A fair price for standard grade cotton will be determined as the standard for pricing various types of cotton, and adjustments may be made at any time based on local production, transportation, and market conditions. The moisture content of cotton shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Preventing Adulteration of Cotton, promulgated on March 23, 1936, with 11% as the legal standard and 12% as the final limit. The quality content shall be in accordance with the provisions of the same regulations, with 0.5% as the legal standard and 2% as the maximum limit. The grades of cotton are determined based on the color, amount of impurities, and quality of ginning, and are divided into six grades: 1. Superior grade, 2. Second superior grade, 3. Medium grade, 4. Second medium grade, 5. Inferior grade, 6. Second inferior grade. The above grades are based on the medium grade as the standard. The fiber length of cotton is determined by the average staple length of each batch of cotton and is divided into seven grades, as follows (unit: inches): 1. 1 1/16 inches (including 1 1/16 and above), 2. 1 inch (including 1 inch to 1 1/32), 3. 15/16 inches (including 15/16 to 31/32), 4. 7/8 inches (including 7/8 to 29/32), 5. 13/16 inches (including 13/16 to 27/32), 6. 3/4 inches (including 3/4 to 25/32), 7. 11/16 inches (including 11/16 and below). The above fiber grades are based on 7/8 as the standard. All firms and merchants engaged in the cotton trading business shall sell the cotton they purchase to this Committee's cotton purchasing agency or other entrusted agencies and entrusted yarn millers' trade associations at the prices determined locally, and shall not hoard or sell privately. The transportation and re-export of cotton shall be subject to the transportation certificate issued by this Committee, and the areas of implementation will be announced at any time. All yarn millers in cotton-producing areas that have not been designated for contracted spinning may apply for registration and, after approval, purchase cotton locally with the purchasing certificate issued by this Committee at the price stipulated by this Committee, limited to the amount used for three months of storage. All factories located in non-cotton-producing areas that have not been designated for contracted spinning may apply for registration and, after approval, this Committee will allocate and sell cotton at the stipulated price at any time, or issue a purchasing certificate and designate an area for self-purchase according to the price and quantity stipulated by this Committee. These details may be amended at any time with the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs if there are any incomplete matters. These regulations shall be implemented after being submitted to and approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

(B) Implementation Details for Yarn Distribution: These details are formulated in accordance with Articles 2, 4, and 8 of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations. The distribution of cotton yarn is targeted at cotton yarn reprocessing factories or their trade associations and yarn merchants that have been registered and qualified by this Committee. Before the registration and investigation of the cotton yarn distribution accounts in the preceding paragraph have been completed, the cotton yarn reprocessing industry will temporarily take the trade association's distribution accounts as the target, and the yarn merchants will temporarily take the distribution accounts that have been registered and qualified by the China Textile Construction Company as the target. If the Textile Construction Company has not registered yarn merchants locally, the business names reported by the trade association will be temporarily used as the target. The distribution of cotton cloth is targeted at cloth merchants and dyeing factories that have been registered and qualified by this Committee. Before the registration and investigation of the cotton cloth distribution accounts in the preceding paragraph have been completed, the distribution accounts that have been registered and qualified by the Textile Construction Company will be temporarily used as the target. If the Textile Construction Company has not registered cotton cloth distribution accounts locally, the manufacturers reported by the trade association will be temporarily used as the target. The registration of yarn and cloth distribution accounts shall meet the following conditions: A. Having joined the local trade association, obtained a membership certificate, and registered with the competent authority and obtained a certificate. B. Having paid taxes or declared to the tax authorities and obtained a certificate. C. Production factories with factory buildings, equipment, and production tools that are in operation. D. Yarn and cloth merchant companies with business premises and business equipment that are in operation. The application form in the preceding paragraph shall be stamped and certified by the trade association, and then submitted to this Committee for review. After investigation, a registration certificate will be issued. Small-scale or handicraft weaving households, legal groups, and cotton yarn reprocessing factories and cloth merchants in various places where this Committee has not set up distribution agencies may register with this Committee in the name of the local trade association or legal group, stating the production equipment, yarn count, capital amount, and turnover, and a registration certificate will be issued after approval. The amount of yarn to be distributed to cotton yarn reprocessing factories or other trade associations shall be determined by this Committee based on their production equipment and yarn requirements. The amount of cloth to be distributed to dyeing factories shall be determined by this Committee based on their production equipment and cloth requirements. The amount of yarn and cloth to be distributed to yarn merchants and cloth merchants shall be determined by this Committee based on the yarn and cloth supply and demand situation. Yarn and cloth distribution shall be based on the method of quotation and sales. When distributing yarn and cloth, each yarn and cloth distribution account shall report its willingness to pay and the quantity it is willing to purchase, and apply for distribution. Then, this Committee or the local office shall determine a reasonable price and quantity with reference to the reported price and market conditions. Cotton yarn reprocessing factories have priority in purchasing yarn. When necessary, this Committee may entrust reputable yarn and cloth merchants with retail stores in major cities to sell yarn and cloth on its behalf, and the relationship between the rights and responsibilities of the two parties shall be stipulated in the entrustment contract. If the cotton yarn purchased by cotton yarn reprocessing factories or their trade associations and yarn merchants, or the cloth purchased by cloth merchants and dyeing factories, is not paid for or picked up within the specified time after approval, the distribution may be suspended for a certain period or the registration may be revoked, depending on the circumstances.

### Gandhi's Assassination Mourned Worldwide Nehru Announces National Mourning Attlee Calls on India and Pakistan to Resolve Remaining Differences

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcasting: Washington News, Truman deeply regrets Gandhi's assassination, believing that Gandhi's death is a tragic loss to the whole world.

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 30th Broadcasting: Prime Minister Attlee will deliver a broadcast speech tonight, begging India and Pakistan to resolve their differences. After Gandhi's assassination, riots have broken out in Bombay, and the situation is chaotic.

[Reuters, London, 30th] The news of Gandhi's assassination shocked the entire British government and people. The British government will immediately issue a statement expressing its condolences and sympathy to the Indian people. The British government will also issue a similar statement through the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. The Indian High Commission in London immediately lowered its flag to half-mast, and the High Commissioner refused to see guests. Generally speaking, there is a fear that Gandhi was the keystone of India, and that once he is gone, it will be more difficult to restrain the rioters. Cables from Lake Success and Washington all show the shock of the people there. United Nations officials unanimously condemned the atrocity and expressed hope that it would not hinder peace in India.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 30th] Indian representative to the United Nations, Aiyangar, declared today that Gandhi's assassination was "the greatest tragedy in our country's history. I deeply hope that our country can survive this major blow. There are still many leaders who will definitely be able to turn the country from danger to safety."

[Associated Press, Manila, 30th] After hearing the news of Gandhi's assassination, Philippine President Roxas said, "My heart is filled with sorrow. A great man in the world has now died." British Minister to the Philippines, Folger, also said, "This is truly abhorrent."

[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] Two hours after Gandhi's assassination, Prime Minister Nehru, with a heavy heart, announced to the crowd gathered outside his residence that India would enter a period of national mourning starting at midnight on the 30th. When Gandhi's assassination occurred, Indians ran to tell each other, and the news quickly spread throughout the country. For a time, the sound of "The Father of the Nation has been assassinated, quickly spread the news" was heard everywhere. All India Radio also announced the news of Gandhi's assassination to all of India, and the bulletin said: "We must announce with extreme sadness that Gandhi passed away a moment ago. Gandhi was shot three to four times on the way to prayer at 5:00 PM this afternoon. The bullets hit his chest, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot."

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 30th] After Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated tonight, the government here immediately convened an emergency meeting, chaired by Premier Nehru. The local police hurriedly implemented security measures to prevent new riots between different religious groups. The old district of Chandni Chowk, which has always been a hotbed of unrest, is now under strict patrol by mounted police.

[Agence France-Presse, Karachi, 30th] Government circles and Muslim people received the news of Gandhi's assassination with great resentment. Gandhi was regarded by them as the only surviving person who could use his great spirit to move the people of India and Pakistan and enable the two countries to achieve understanding and friendship. Therefore, all political circles feel that the unexpected death of this old man is a sign of danger for the future.

### Gandhi's Life: Struggling for Peace and Freedom Three Imprisonments and Four Fasts

[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869. He studied at Rajkot, Bhavnagar, London, and other places. In 1889, he obtained a lawyer's license and practiced law in South Africa for as long as seventeen years. He successively led the passive resistance movement of Indian immigrants in South Africa, and finally reached a solution agreement with General Smuts in 1914. He returned to India in 1915, and in 1918 he began his non-cooperation movement. In 1930, he launched the movement to abolish the salt law. He was detained by the British authorities on May 5 of that year and was released on January 26 of the following year. In 1931, he repeatedly negotiated with the Governor-General of India and finally concluded the Delhi Treaty. In the same year, he attended the Second Round Table Conference as a representative. In 1932, he was imprisoned again, and he fasted for a week in prison. Later, he fasted for three weeks to demand improved treatment for the untouchable class before he was released from prison. After his release from prison, he launched a civil disobedience patrol movement. In 1933, he was imprisoned again. After his release from prison, he announced another fast, asking the public to support the movement to oppose the untouchable system. In 1934, he withdrew from the active leadership of the Congress Party and instructed the Congress Party to accept government positions under the new reform guidance system. He himself continued to guide the policies of the Congress Party in the village of Sevagram, the headquarters of his rural construction work. Later, he led the movement to fight for freedom of speech, writing, and action, until 1942 when he announced the cessation of this movement. Gandhi's ideal was for the British to withdraw from India, which became a reality on August 15, 1947. On January 12 of this year, he fasted again to call for peace between India and Pakistan, and ended the fast five days later. Afterwards, he expressed his hope to live to 130 years old so that he could continue to serve the people of India. A week ago, when Gandhi was addressing a prayer meeting, a homemade bomb exploded twenty yards away from him, but he was not injured and continued to speak as if nothing had happened.

Impasse in India-Pakistan Problem Indian Representatives Insist on Ceasing Fire First Lake Success, Ranjan Hoff's Suggestion Fails to be Implemented

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 29th] As India continues to insist that stopping the Kashmir war is a prerequisite for holding a plebiscite, the Security Council seems to agree to both simultaneously in order to resolve the India-Pakistan dispute. The President of the Council, Ranjan Hoff, proposed two motions at the opening of the meeting today: one called for a plebiscite, and the other called for efforts to stop the war. Both tasks are to be undertaken by a three-person mediation committee that has not yet been established. China, the United States, Britain, France, and Canada all strongly support Ranjan Hoff's proposal, but the Council failed to take action today due to a lengthy speech of opposition by the Indian representative.

[Also Dispatch] Our representative Jiang Tingfu told the Central News Agency reporter today that the Chinese delegation hopes that the Security Council's handling of the India-Pakistan dispute will be resolved and that an on-site investigation can be conducted as soon as possible. Jiang, our permanent representative to the United Nations, returned to the United Nations headquarters today after leaving here for two months.

### French Parliament Approves Recall of Large Franc Notes All Banks Resume Operations Yesterday

[United Press, Paris, 30th] The French National Assembly approved Premier Schuman's proposal this morning to recall the large 5,000 franc notes. It is estimated that the amount of these francs in circulation reaches $1,399.3 million. The National Assembly also decided by a vote of 320 to 284 that these francs will no longer be the legal tender of France. Schuman said that if his proposal was rejected, his cabinet would resign. Faced with the threat of the cabinet's resignation, the deputies voted to pass the proposal. Some observers believe that if the French cabinet collapses, it will accelerate the decisive struggle between the Communists and the de Gaulle faction for power. The Parliament's Finance Committee had previously rejected the government's proposal, but the National Assembly overturned the Finance Committee's rejection by a vote of 320 to 288. Those who supported the government were Schuman, the Popular Republican Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Central Independent faction.

### UN Mission to Korea to Hold General Meeting to Decide Policy

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 29th] The United Nations Mission to Korea is currently awaiting developments in the Korean situation. It is reported that some members of the mission are awaiting instructions from their respective governments before formally responding to the Soviet Union's rejection. The mission, citing the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate, is scheduled to hold a plenary session within days to discuss the future course of action for the mission. Some members believe that since the United Nations has not authorized the mission to hold a general election solely in southern Korea, the matter should be submitted to the United Nations Committee for deliberation, and they believe that the United Nations Committee should formulate quantitative measures based on the mission's recommendations. At the same time, the mission's Second Subcommittee continues to solicit opinions from Korean leaders.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 30th] According to qualified Korean and American observers here, unless the United Nations Mission to Korea can establish a unified Korean government, or reach an agreement before the Soviets withdraw their troops, the resolution of the Korean issue will inevitably lead to bloodshed and tragedy. The intense emotions of mutual hatred created in the two occupied zones are historically bound to lead to war.

### US Rejects Soviet Protest Over Construction of Air Base in North Africa

Soviet Union Protests US Naval Vessels Stationed in US Ports

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The US State Department today presented a memorandum to the Soviet Union, rejecting the Soviet protest against the US Air Force reopening the Manarah Air Base in North Africa.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] President Truman stated today at a press conference that it is absolutely necessary for Congress not to make substantial cuts in the amount of aid for the Marshall Plan. He said that reports that a congressional committee plans to reduce the initial 15-month aid budget of $6.8 billion by a substantial $2.3 billion would turn the recovery plan into a mere relief program. He added that if the United States cannot implement the recovery plan, it would be better not to take any action at all. He declared with the utmost seriousness: "The welfare of the United States and the welfare of the whole world are closely tied to this one thing. I cannot describe it in more emphatic terms. World peace depends on the recovery and independence of Europe. In other words, it depends on the success of the Marshall Plan. I believe that spending $17 billion to buy peace is not too high a price." The President also expressed hope that Congress would pass the entire four-year and one-quarter aid program for Europe and that it should not vote on each year's plan individually.

[United Press, London, 30th] TASS reports that the Soviet Union has formally protested, arguing that the presence of the US Navy in Italian seaports violates the Italian Peace Treaty. TASS stated that the above protest was lodged on the 28th by Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, with US Secretary of State Marshall, less than 24 hours after the Soviet Union protested against the Anglo-American decision to re-establish air bases in Libya. The US State Department has not yet commented on this.

### Allied Headquarters Spokesman Denies Existence of "Invisible Government" in Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] General MacArthur's headquarters spokesman, Steve   Prope, today denied the existence of an "invisible government" in Japan. He stated at a press conference: "It is unfortunate that some quarters have the mistaken impression that there is a kind of underground, invisible government in Japan." He added: "However, it is clear that there are indeed unhealthy forces at work in Japan that influence the government, and this is not unique to Japan. Behind the government of any country, there are unhealthy political forces."

### Emperor Hirohito's Poetry Competition Hints at Japan's Future

"Spring is Approaching, White Snow Melts"

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 30th] Japanese newspapers today published poems from the "New Year Poetry Party," an old Japanese tradition hosted by the Imperial Palace authorities, with the theme set by the Emperor.

(Poetic meaning) Some people believe that this poem hints that Japan is still facing difficulties, but will have a bright future.

The First Stroke Wrote Good News on My Heart

The life of someone involved in politics is made up of a series of contradictions. I have deeply tasted the flavors, but nothing has been longer, more successful, or more important than the struggle to win trade agreements. When I first gave a speech in Congress calling for lower tariffs and fewer trade restrictions, I was thirty-six years old; when we finally achieved victory in 1934, I was already sixty-two. The temporary victory of lowering tariffs when the Underwood Act was passed in 1913 was greatly affected by the outbreak of the World War, and as soon as the Republican Party took power in 1921, they immediately tore it to pieces.

When I returned from Montevideo, I discovered two things: on the one hand, the President approved of the trade agreement plan and expressed his support; but on the extreme opposite side, he appointed George Peek, during my absence, to chair a committee to adjust foreign trade relations. Peek, who had served as Director of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, distrusted the measures of lowering tariffs and advocated establishing a prohibition of commerce around the country to implement the policies of the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. If his theory were implemented, it would mean the demise of the trade agreement policy. This appointment occurred one week after the establishment of the Commercial Policy Executive Committee.

I immediately joined the Commercial Policy Executive Committee and began working on drafting the Trade Agreements Act. I found that there was a unanimous opinion in the committee that Congress should authorize the President to establish reciprocal trade agreements. Everyone believed that only this kind of government-implemented agreement could succeed. If the treaty contained a large number of most-favored-nation tariff provisions and had to be submitted to the Senate for approval, there would be no hope of success.

I believe that in my country's foreign policy, the economic aspect is on one side, and the political aspect is on the other, but the two are closely related. It seems impossible to me to develop friendly relations with other countries in the political sphere without abandoning the provocation of other countries' hostility in the economic sphere. How can we cooperate with them to promote peace when we are fighting them economically? When I entered the State Department, I found thirty-four formal and strong diplomatic protests in the State Department's archives, which were filed by no less than thirty-four countries after the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Act. Their protests were not limited to words. They considered prohibiting their exports from entering the United States to be tantamount to prohibiting trade. In anger, they retaliated with international actions.

When I returned from Montevideo, I went straight to the point, preparing to submit the trade agreement plan to Congress and pass it. By the end of February 1934, we had completed the Trade Agreements Act. Ironically, our opponent Peek actually provided us with considerable practical assistance. The original draft was too long and too complicated. Peek suggested, "Shorten the bill to two or three pages, and the chances will be better." We followed his advice, and he was right.

On March 20, the bill passed the House by a vote of 274 to 111; on June 4, it passed the Senate by a vote of 57 to 33. In both the House and the Senate, the strong opposition to the Smoot-Hawley Act was helpful to us.

At 9:15 PM on June 12, I personally witnessed the President signing the bill into law in the White House. Each stroke of the President seemed to write good news on my heart. The long struggle I had waged for many years to establish a reciprocal trade policy and reduce tariff wars had finally achieved final victory.

What is the Trade Agreements Act? Based on my experience in Congress and the State Department, I feel that the public is more likely to grasp and is more interested in the many broad political actions of our government in foreign affairs than the difficult-to-understand economic actions. It is not too difficult to understand a diplomatic protest, a political treaty, the recall of an ambassador, or the recognition of a new government. However, it is indeed difficult to understand the interrelationship between foreign commerce, tariffs, currency exchange, and debts.

The Trade Agreements Act itself is simple and fundamentally includes three key points: trade agreements can be negotiated without first submitting them to Congress; tariffs can be reduced by up to half, provided that our country obtains equivalent concessions from other countries. The tariff reduction measures apply equally to all countries that do not discriminate against us.

The first two points need no explanation. The third point is a subject that has caused considerable controversy. This is the so-called unconditional most-favored-nation clause. This wording is not the most appropriate. It gives the impression of obtaining or granting preferential or special treatment. In fact, it only means: "I will not treat you worse than I treat the best, as long as you do not treat me worse than you treat the best."

As for reducing tariffs, the meaning is very simple: when we reduce the tariff rate on certain goods imported from Country A, we also reduce the tariff rate on the same goods imported from Countries B-Z, as long as Countries B-Z give us the same low rates and the same amount of freedom for our exports as they give to any other country (the so-called Countries B-Z refer to countries other than Country A—Translator). If Country B imposes higher taxes or more restrictions on our products than on products imported from any other country, then Country B must also pay the high tax rates stipulated by the Smoot-Hawley Act on our exports—which is the pinnacle of learning in American history.

In practice, we have always implemented the most-favored-nation principle in a conditional form until 1923. This means that when we sign a tariff treaty with Country A, our tariff reduction measures do not apply to Countries B-Z unless Countries B-Z agree to give us the same concessions that Country A gives us. Secretary of State Hughes during the Harding administration began to implement this principle in an unconditional form.

The conditional form of the most-favored-nation principle has proven to be a failure. Why? The trade between any two countries and the trade between one of those countries and another country are never the same in terms of products or quantity. If we reduce certain tariffs on Country A in exchange for Country A reducing certain tariffs on us, it is difficult to explain what is being exchanged for Country A's reduction of a certain tariff rate on us. Therefore, we cannot go to Country B and say: "We are willing to give you the same low tariff rates that we give to Country A, as long as you can agree to give us the same low tariff rates that Country A gives us." Country B may not be interested in the goods stipulated in the agreement we have with Country A. This system also creates endless negotiations with many countries.

Therefore, the Trade Agreements Act will declare that an unconditional policy must be implemented. But some people argue that this is equivalent to giving people some rights without any corresponding gains. They would say, "You have reduced the tariff rate on horses, seeds, and whiskey imported from Country A, and you have obtained from Country A a reduction in the tariff rate on our exported cars, wheat, and lard. That's great! Then you go to Countries B-Z and give them the low tariff rates we gave to Country A—but you don't get anything in exchange! That's not okay!"

But the fact is that we can strike many exchanges. Countries B-Z can get the same low tariff rates that we give to Country A if they do not discriminate against us. Country B has always or only applied the lowest tariff rate to Countries Y and Z, but if Country B wants to enjoy our low tariff rates, it must give us the same tariff rates that it gives to Countries Y and Z. Therefore, the use of the name unconditional most-favored-nation is quite likely to cause misunderstanding. Other countries obtain our low tariff rates, not without conditions, but on the condition that they give us equal treatment.

In fact, this principle has earned American exporters hundreds of millions of dollars.

In the first two years after the establishment of the trade agreement, our exports were estimated to be worth as much as $265 million due to the equal treatment and non-discrimination guarantees we obtained from other countries.

Others would argue that extending the tariff reduction measures, in addition to the country with which we have already signed a trade agreement, to other countries would inevitably lead to a large influx of imports. They say, "Reducing the tariff rate on shoes imported from Country A may be appropriate, but if Countries NB-A also ship shoes to our country at the same tariff rate, shoes will flood our market."

The answer is that Countries B-Z do not all manufacture shoes for export. Perhaps only one or two countries export shoes, and possibly less than Country A.

If Country A is our main competitor in a certain commodity, and we can allow Country A to reduce tariffs without harming our own producers, then our producers are unlikely to be harmed by the competition of imports from Country B or Country C. Because in terms of supply, they are ultimately secondary.

In fact, countries that export to our country are always the main exporters of a certain commodity or certain commodities. Due to climate, traditional technology, or the location of raw material production, they are better suited to produce these items for us, better and cheaper than other countries.

Therefore, when negotiating trade agreements, we pay special attention to reducing the tariffs on these types of products, while ignoring other products, because these products are not our main exporters to us. In this way, we can obtain the greatest tariff steps from Country A for our own exports, while our imports from Country A are concentrated on the items in which it has the most inventory. As for the products that we neglect from Country A, they can be obtained through negotiations with other countries, with everything focusing on the main exporting country. This approach is called the "finding the main supplier" approach.

Since 1916, I have always believed that economic warfare breeds political warfare, and non-discriminatory trade can reduce the possibility of war. The Trade Agreements Act was passed in 1934, but the following year, war broke out in Africa, three years later in Asia, and five years later in Europe. Therefore, some people may say, "Look, trade agreements cannot prevent war."

Of course, I have never claimed that trade agreements are a panacea for preventing war. Moreover, at the time the trade agreement was passed, Hitler had been in power for a year and a half and was frantically carrying out armaments; Mussolini had been in power for almost twelve years and was planning the Abyssinian War; Japan had entered Manchuria for almost three years and was preparing to withdraw from the naval limitation treaty. The free commerce promoted in the trade agreement was of no use to these countries because they had already adapted their commerce to the needs of war.

If something like the Trade Agreements Act could have been passed in 1922, instead of the Fordney-McCumber Act, as I urged in several speeches I gave during World War I, the situation might have been different.

When I was a child on a farm in Tennessee, we had two neighbors—let me call them Jenkins and Jones—who were hostile to each other. For many years, they had harbored ill feelings towards each other—I don't know why. When they met on the road, in town, or in church, they always glared at each other coldly and never spoke.

Later, one spring, when Jenkins needed mules to cultivate the land the most, one of his donkeys kicked up its heels. At the same time, Jones lacked corn to feed his pigs. As luck would have it, Jones had finished cultivating and had a mule idle, while Jenkins had a barn of corn. A friendly third party brought the two men together, and Jones let Jenkins use his mule in exchange for corn for feeding the pigs.

As a result, these two enemies, who had harbored old grudges, soon became the best of friends. A common transaction and a normal neighborly relationship made them realize each other's economic needs and finally reconciled.

Yes, the war still came even though the trade agreement was signed. But it is a fact that the war did not break out between the United States and any country with which we could negotiate a trade agreement. With very few exceptions, it is also a fact that all the countries that signed trade agreements with us were united with us against the Axis. Political ties are based on economic ties.

### Order for Dissolution Allowed to Be Postponed, Tongji University Ordered to Resume Classes in Full; Vice Minister Hang Issues Written Statement; Severely Criticizes Illegal Actions and Orders Separate Disciplinary Actions

[This Newspaper] The incident in which a small number of unruly elements from the Tongji University student unrest surrounded and beat Mayor Wu the other day has shocked both China and foreign countries, and the central authorities were particularly angered upon hearing the news. Executive Yuan Chief Zhang Qun and Education Minister Zhu Jiahua specially dispatched Education Vice Minister Hang Liwu, along with Secondary Education Director Wu Zhaotang, carrying the order to dissolve Tongji University, to Shanghai yesterday morning to handle the school's strike. President Ding Wenyuan personally went to the North Railway Station yesterday morning to welcome Hang, reported in detail the situation of the students surrounding and beating Mayor Wu the previous day, and the municipal authorities' assistance in handling the aftermath, and requested that Hang temporarily postpone the announcement of the dissolution order, saying that he would persuade the students to resume classes immediately. After President Ding left, Hang began to investigate the details of the incident. At 4 PM, he convened a meeting of university presidents at the International Hotel, attended by Ding Wenyuan of Tongji, Zhang Yi of Fudan, Cheng Xiaogang of Jiaotong, Zhu Jingnong of Guanghua, Ou Yuanhuai of Daxia, Hu Dunfu of Datong, and Hu Wenyao of   and Ling Xianyuan of Shanghai. Hang inquired about the situation of each school separately and gave instructions on rectifying academic ethics. After the meeting, the entire group went to Mayor Wu's residence to express their condolences to the mayor. He then received reporters and issued a written statement as follows: "The current turmoil caused by some students of Tongji University not complying with the law has been dragging on for more than ten days. The school authorities and faculty members have been able to maintain a strict and appropriate approach, which the Ministry greatly relies on and has repeatedly dispatched personnel to Shanghai to assist. Until yesterday (the 29th), a small number of unruly elements incited the crowd, overstepped the bounds, and even insulted the mayor. This kind of illegal behavior is not allowed in any country. The central authorities attach great importance to it. In order to safeguard education and rectify academic ethics, the Ministry has decided to take strict measures and thoroughly rectify the situation. I came to Shanghai this morning, already carrying the order to dissolve Tongji University. However, according to President Ding of the school, the students have shown considerable remorse, and he requested a temporary postponement of the dissolution order. Therefore, President Ding has announced to the striking students that they must all resume classes immediately, otherwise they will comply with the dissolution order. Regarding the instigators from other schools, the security organs have provisionally allowed each school authority to bail them out, to be summoned and present at any time. In order to rectify academic ethics, the Ministry has ordered each school authority to investigate the circumstances and take separate disciplinary actions. As for the students who were arrested for assaulting people and other criminals, in addition to the responsible organs of the city severely punishing them according to law, the school will still wait for the investigation to be completed before taking further action. Furthermore, according to the results of the inspection among the students yesterday, in the Tongji strike incident, not only were there non-Tongji students involved, but some were not students at all. It is now clear that the school turmoil today is a planned策动 by villains. The endurance and sense of responsibility of Mayor Wu and others in yesterday's unfortunate incident are admirable. Today, I have represented Executive Yuan Chief Zhang and Minister Zhu to express my condolences." Hang also stated that tomorrow (the 31st), Tongji classes will take attendance by name, and if it is found that anyone is absent from class without a reason, the school will severely punish them.

### Five Medical Students at Tongji Suddenly Announce Strike Yesterday; Students in Other Two Colleges Mostly Return to Normal

[This Newspaper] Tongji University students partially resumed classes yesterday, but five students in the medical school, instigated by unruly elements, suddenly announced a strike again. The school was still trying to persuade them until late at night. More than ninety Jiaotong University students who stayed in the Qimei Road Engineering College of the school the previous night were finally claimed by the person in charge of the school and left yesterday afternoon. Most of the students of the college were not in the college, and the students who stayed in the college mostly gathered in the dormitory to talk about the conflict with the police the previous day, with a leisurely attitude. Some students were still running around on the field, ignoring reporters' interviews. Propaganda documents all over the walls have been torn down, and the classrooms inside and outside have not yet been cleaned. The huge campus presents a desolate scene. There were only two classes of students in the classrooms upstairs, refusing reporters to take pictures. Dozens of resident doctors in the college stayed in the college for food and accommodation yesterday, chatting with students from time to time, looking quite close. The gate of the college was guarded by doctors, and students entered and exited with certificates. At the Faculty of Law at the end of Sichuan Road, most of the students had gone to class, but they were in twos and threes, and their spirits were very scattered. Dean Xu Daolin personally took attendance in each class to count the number of students attending class and sent it to President Ding for review in the evening. However, the five students in the medical school, who had never been on strike, declared a strike for the first time yesterday, claiming to show support for the students who had suffered, due to the instigation of unruly elements. Despite the professors of the college trying to persuade them in many ways, they were still at an impasse until late at night.

### Hoping Parents Restrain Their Children to Focus on Seeking Knowledge and Loving the Country: Various Organizations Publish a Letter to Students' Parents

Yesterday, 25 organizations in the city, including the City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the China Industry Association, the National Federation of Commerce, the National Seamen's Union, the Banking Association, the City Federation of Trade Unions, the Journalists' Association, the City Education Association, the City Farmers' Association, and the Lawyers' Association, issued a letter to parents of students in secondary schools and above in the city regarding the Tongji University student unrest incident. The original text briefly stated: "We believe that since students have been sent to school to study, the school authorities should naturally bear the responsibility of discipline and education. However, the supervision of parents at home should not be neglected. Especially when school facilities are not yet perfect and school guidance is not yet comprehensive, parents should pay special attention to the cultivation of their children's character and the advancement of their studies, and should never completely let them go. We believe that your parents will agree with this point. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, student unrest has occurred continuously in universities across the country, involving strikes, marches, and even large groups of people going to Nanjing to petition. Even if we do not talk about the destruction of social order and tranquility, the loss to the studies of these students is truly incalculable. If we continue to act in such a confused and reckless manner, how can the country entrust these students, who are being used and acting recklessly, with important national tasks? How can we hope that they will recognize their own responsibility to the times? The country is currently facing many troubles, and the suppression of chaos and the building of the nation require talent urgently. We feel that young students are the backbone of the next generation of the country. In order to cherish their future and save the national crisis, we once again appeal to your parents with twelve-thousandth sincerity, hoping that each of you, in your capacity as parents and with the feelings of fathers and brothers, will immediately restrain your children. Focus on seeking knowledge when attending school, and base youthful actions on loving the country. Young people in a democratic era should abide by the law and be models for the public. In particular, they must not fall into the traps of conspirators, be exploited by others, or willingly be puppets, leading to personal ruin and disgrace, and being abandoned by the public. This is not only the glory of fathers and brothers, but also the great fortune of the country and the nation."

### Director of Education Bureau Issues Statement

Li Xike, the Director of the Education Bureau of this city, issued a statement yesterday regarding the student unrest, saying: "Since last summer, students in various schools in this city have been making trouble under various pretexts, stirring up unrest, and taking increasingly extreme actions. Even a few secondary school students have participated in it. Recently, students from the two schools have even assaulted and insulted local administrative leaders. If this trend is not rectified, education will inevitably go bankrupt. Not only will I fail to live up to the heavy trust of the team leader, but I will also have no way to face the country and the nation. Young students are inherently pure, but they are led astray by a small number of people with ulterior motives, acting impulsively and losing their reason, which is truly regrettable. Principals and teachers, bearing the responsibility of education, should patiently guide and skillfully lead students to bring their actions back on track. Students from public and private schools in this city who participated in yesterday's overstepping actions have been ordered to return to their respective schools and should be punished according to the severity of their circumstances as a warning to others. From now on, I hope that the principals and teachers of all schools will share the difficulties of the times, restrain students, and maintain academic integrity. This is what I earnestly hope for."

### Distinguished Guests Gather, Humble Home Shines

[Report from Our Newspaper] The conflict between students of Tongji University and the police on Qimei Road the day before yesterday suddenly turned the Kanglong Wine Shop, where distinguished guests gathered, into a lucrative business. Its daily revenue reached more than 6 million yuan, exceeding its usual daily revenue by five times. The elderly couple, Qu Caiyun, were all smiles as they received the frequent patronage of officials from the municipal government and leaders from all walks of life, considering it a rare and grand occasion. Yesterday, the municipal government sent staff member Zhang Naimin to deliver cigarettes and food expenses, totaling 762,000 yuan, and awarded an additional 200,000 yuan as a reward.

After receiving the money, the elderly couple repeatedly expressed their gratitude. Afterwards, they also requested the municipal government to assist in installing electric lights, and the staff member agreed to help them find a way with the Public Works Bureau.

They also telegraphed the original telegram to various provinces, cities, and organizations across the country, requesting a consistent response. The original telegram stated: "To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, Executive Yuan President Zhang, and Education Minister Zhu:

### Ironclad Evidence of a Conspiracy to Assault the Mayor at Four O'Clock: Dozens of Arrested Students Are Currently Being Interrogated

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the police局, the number of students arrested in this incident totaled dozens. Currently, because it is still under investigation, the names have not been announced yet. However, according to reporters, many of them are imposters of student representatives, and one or two of them were found with propaganda documents of the 共匪 and credentials as liaison officers during this riot. Gong Shao羆, a student from Tongji, was found with an iron box, which contained a slip of paper that read "Strike the Mayor at Four O'Clock," which coincided with the time when the Mayor was assaulted the day before. This shows that this riot was a planned conspiracy. In addition, those arrested included eleven students who had already been expelled from the school, but most of them were lawless elements who disrupted order, obstructed official duties, and assaulted the Mayor. They will be transferred to the court and the garrison headquarters for interrogation in accordance with the law, depending on the severity of the circumstances after the investigation is completed. Education Minister Zhu钧鉴, The environment in Shanghai has always been extremely complicated. Since Mayor Wu took charge of Shanghai's administration, he has always maintained a peaceful and impartial attitude, as well as a spirit of perseverance and struggle, exhausting his efforts and responding to difficulties, so the community has been stable and public opinion has been unified for more than a year. In the past,奸匪 repeatedly launched labor unrest and student unrest in Shanghai, attempting to disrupt the order of the entire city, but all failed under Mayor Wu's careful prevention and control. However, yesterday, a student unrest occurred at Tongji University in this city. Mayor Wu was invited to mediate, but he was assaulted and insulted by the students, which caused the entire city to feel pain and shocked both China and foreign countries. After investigating the Tongji students, it is reasonable that they did not comply with the regulations and formed a department representative assembly, and the principal did not recognize it. The students disregarded the overall situation, besieged the principal, and threatened to strike. It is also reasonable for the principal to expel the main perpetrators in order to maintain school discipline. However, the students forgot their duty to study, made a lot of noise, demanded to collectively petition in Nanjing, and even opposed the government, and their ulterior motives are obvious. After the student crowds gathered, Mayor Wu persuaded them bitterly from morning to night, and even gave up eating, but the students, after making noise and ignoring them, finally took violent actions and assaulted and insulted the Mayor. The various circles in this city, in addition to expressing their deep condolences to the Mayor for suffering such adversity and their deep respect for his spirit of faithfully performing his duties and serving the country with sincerity, and witnessing the youth nurtured by the country, at the time when the country is beginning to implement constitutionalism, in this international cultural center, a few dregs have staged this strange drama of blatant lawlessness, barbarism, and riot, which makes people feel pain for the future of our education and worry for the future of our nation. The various organizations in this city, representing the citizens of the city, deeply believe that education is the lifeline of the country, and academic integrity is the prerequisite for education. Today, the corruption of academic integrity has reached an unbearable level. Noise and strikes have become commonplace, and offending superiors and assaulting teachers have also become a common practice. The spread of the decadent trend will lead to the demise of teachers' ethics and the bankruptcy of education. I respectfully request that the competent officials be ordered to forcefully reverse the tide and strictly rectify it, so that young students can move towards the right track and the foundation of the nation can be laid here. As for the violent actions of the Tongji students this time, it is obviously a separate conspiracy, attempting to disrupt the country, and the ambitious elements who impersonate students and spread chaos, as well as the destructive elements who have been found to have奸匪 evidence, are even more unforgivable, and I pray that you will order a thorough investigation and severely punish them to maintain discipline and the foundation of the country.

### Actively Dredging the Suzhou River to Ensure Smooth Flow of Rice and Grain Sources

Mayor Wu, considering that the city will implement a comprehensive rice rationing and voucher purchase system starting in March, and in order to enrich the stock and channel grain sources, previously instructed the Public Works Bureau to entrust the Dredging Bureau with the task of dredging the Suzhou River, so as to avoid temporary congestion of rice boats. Since the start of construction, the Dredging Bureau has regularly dispatched one dredger, one tugboat, and four mud barges to carry out construction in the river. Currently, the project has progressed from the mouth of the river to the section from Sichuan Road Bridge to Henan Road Bridge. In order to meet the actual needs, the bureau has intensified the dredging of the important river section from the mouth of the river to Maigen Road Bridge. If there is any urgent need in other sections, ships will be temporarily transferred to carry out dredging to facilitate grain transportation.

### Technician Legislator Election: Zeng Yangfu Takes the Lead, Chen Ganqing of Shanghai Receives the Most Votes

### Mayor's Face Swollen, Head and Waist Aching: Chairman and Madam Concerned and Telegraph Comfort One After Another: People from All Walks of Life in This City Visited the Municipal Government to Express Condolences

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu was surrounded and insulted while dissuading Tongji University students from petitioning in Nanjing the day before yesterday (the 29th). He rested at his official residence yesterday and did not go to the municipal government to work. He consulted a doctor yesterday, and the doctor advised him to lie down and rest for one or two days. Currently, the mayor has swelling in his temples and cheeks, and feels pain in his head, brain, and waist. Chairman Chiang was greatly angered upon hearing the news and immediately sent a telegram of condolence. Madam Chiang also telephoned Mayor Wu personally at 6:00 PM yesterday to express her condolences. Mayor Wu's wife answered the phone, reported the details of the mayor's injuries, and conveyed her greetings. In addition, leaders and representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai went to the municipal government and the official residence to express their condolences in an endless stream. It is believed that such an outrageous action was instigated behind the scenes by conspirators, and they unanimously demanded that discipline be rectified and academic integrity be revived.

### Chairman Infuriated and Determined to Punish the Culprits

Chairman Chiang's original telegram of condolence is as follows: "Urgent. Shanghai Mayor Wu. Confidential. I am very surprised to hear that you were injured in Tongji. I am very concerned about your injury. Please reply! Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten note. Zishifu seal" According to Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of Education who rushed to Nanjing from Nanjing, "The Chairman was extremely angry after hearing about the illegal actions of the students and insisted on severely punishing the perpetrators." Also, after Mayor Wu 　 returned to his official residence from Tongji at 2:30 AM yesterday morning, he reported the handling process to President Zhang by long 　 telephone at 3:00 AM.

### Condolences from All Circles

Yesterday, around 11:00 AM, many people went to the Municipal Government to express their condolences, including Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Xu Jiyu, Du Yuesheng, Ge Jechen, Wu Yun Chu, Li Renzai, Shui Xiangyun, Ding, Feng Youzhen, Zhou Maicheng, Wan Lin, Tang Chengzong, Chu Shun, Ma Shao, Xi Yushu, Jiang Pingfan, Tian Shujun, Yu Wen, Fan Shouyuan, Wang Ziyang, Wang Gongkuan, Yang Shoubei, Bu Xian, Yang Fusheng, Li Yunliang, Zhang Zhongyuan and over fifty others. In addition, Ma Guoying, a student from Wei Yu Elementary School, presented a small flower basket. Hang Liwu, the Vice Minister of Education, also attended. The Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian represented the city in receiving them at the auditorium.

### Speaker Pan Delivers Two Speeches: The School Authorities Should Bear Responsibility

Speaker Pan stood up and delivered sincere words of condolence twice, roughly stating: Mayor Wu being beaten by students of Tongji University has caused Shanghai citizens to feel deeply sorry and indignant. However, when the students' actions exceeded normal boundaries, Mayor Wu still strictly instructed the police "not to open fire." Despite being injured, he did not fall into the conspiracy of the communists. Until late at night, he earnestly advised the students to resume classes. His great spirit of caring for students is truly worthy of our respect. The few students who committed the violence should be severely punished according to the law. The rest of the good students, I believe, will be inspired by the Mayor's spirit and realize their mistakes. Speaker Pan also stated that the principal should bear full responsibility for this incident. Tongji students have been on strike for two or three weeks. Mayor Wu went to persuade the students not to petition in Nanjing, from morning until late at night, but the principal was not at the school all day and only arrived around 6:00 PM after the Mayor was insulted. We should demand that the government punish such irresponsible school authorities. Furthermore, Commander Xuan asked the principals of various schools to take their students back late last night, and entrusted Chen Baotai to go. At that time, the Mayor was talking with Tongji professors and student representatives, advising the students to send ten representatives and form a small group for easy consultation. Unexpectedly, some students still did not understand, and continued to incite violence, shouting and rushing forward. Stones and wooden sticks flew everywhere. The Mayor's hat was knocked off, and the right side of his head was hit four or five times with a wooden stick. The Mayor was pushed to the ground, and the students punched and kicked him. Yet, the Mayor still tried to stand up and prevent the police from taking action. The police were moved to tears by the situation. Although the Mayor was humiliated, he said in an extremely gentle manner: "Insult is one thing, mediation is another." He never ceased to mediate and persuade. And he instructed the representatives: "Hand over the students who insulted the Mayor. The expelled students must leave the school. Resume classes immediately tomorrow." Finally, Commander Xuan believed that the students' actions of beating and insulting the Mayor had already gone too far, and that students from various schools were mixed together. He ordered a search of the students' ID cards. The students were taken back by the principals of their respective schools and placed under observation at the school. The Mayor considered the insult a small matter and the resumption of classes a major one, and continued to earnestly persuade the students. Most of the students were inspired by the Mayor's spirit and expressed remorse, promising to resume classes today. However, the principals of several schools could not be found. If it is said that this was a free off-campus activity for the students and the schools cannot interfere, how can this be the way to run national education? If such a phenomenon exists in national education, what can we expect for the future? Last time, Jiaotong University students beat Deputy Bureau Chief Li. The incident has been brewing for some time, it is not something new. In order to get to the root of the problem, all circles in Shanghai should ask the government to rectify the discipline. If education is not strict, it is the teachers' laziness. If the academic atmosphere is not good, the principals and teachers should all bear the responsibility. Moreover, the Tongji student unrest has gone beyond normal boundaries and should have been disbanded long ago. However, the Mayor was magnanimous and only demanded that classes be resumed. Except for those who beat and insulted the Mayor on the spot, who will be dealt with according to the law, the rest will not be pursued. Therefore, if Tongji students still do not resume classes today, the government should be asked to disband the school immediately and demand that the Ministry of Education investigate and replace all irresponsible principals of national universities.

### Chairman Fang Recounts What He Witnessed

Chairman Fang described in detail what he had witnessed, saying: After learning that Mayor Wu had personally gone to Tongji, I immediately accompanied Deputy Chairman Cao Zun. It is estimated that from 11:00 AM to 3:00 AM, the Mayor spared no effort to maintain order and ensure stability in Shanghai, even at the expense of going without food. This is truly worthy of the respect of all citizens of the city.

### Secretary-General Shen Expresses Gratitude on Behalf of the Mayor

Secretary-General Shen expressed gratitude on behalf of Mayor Wu, roughly stating: The turmoil at Tongji University has been brewing for two or three weeks. A few days ago, the Mayor learned that the students were planning to go to Nanjing to petition, which could affect the city's security. He was very anxious and sent people to persuade them, saying that there was no need to go to Nanjing. The student representatives came to see him and asked the Mayor to personally explain the situation. The Mayor went to the school yesterday, but he did not expect the students to behave in this way. He was injured, hoarse, and exhausted. He is still unable to get out of bed today. Hearing that representatives from all circles have come to express their condolences, the Mayor is very grateful and specifically instructed me to express his gratitude to everyone.

### Xu Jiyu and Others Request the Maintenance of Discipline

Xu Jiyu said: Student unrest may be unavoidable from time to time, but it has never been heard of that students would beat and insult the Mayor. Such actions are not like students acting like students, and schools not acting like schools. They are practically approaching riotous mobs. Such schools should not exist. Today, we should not only ask about the Mayor's condition but should also further express concrete opinions. To maintain Shanghai's security, the existence of riotous mobs cannot be tolerated. Wang Xiaoyu said: The form of student unrest is becoming increasingly intense, which is chilling. I have just returned from Nanjing and immediately instructed my children not to blindly follow. Mayor Wu has extraordinary talent and should deal with extraordinary changes and endure extraordinary humiliation. However, the government's discipline should be maintained, and the students' parents should also be responsible. Li Yunliang said: Mayor Wu's insult this time was not the students' insult, but the communists' insult through their hands, a direct insult to the Mayor, and an indirect insult to all Shanghai citizens. Jiaotong University and Tongji University used to have a very good academic atmosphere, but now they are being instigated by the communists, who are using the students' names to cause trouble. Shanghai citizens should express their righteous views.

### The Ministry Is Determined to Rectify the Academic Atmosphere

Vice Minister Hang Liwu said: This unfortunate incident is not only heartbreaking but also embarrassing. I am here with a disbandment order. Because Mayor Wu, despite being insulted, still gave the students until 2:00 PM on the 30th to resume classes, otherwise he would disband the school. As for the students from other schools who participated, they will be dealt with separately. I fully accept Speaker Pan's various opinions. The Ministry is determined to rectify the academic atmosphere of various schools. I am very willing to learn from everyone's valuable opinions.

Finally, Li Renzai, Wang Xianqing, and student representatives spoke one after another and expressed their condolences. The meeting adjourned at 12:40 PM.

### A Communications Officer of the Garrison Command is Accused of Manslaughter

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Su Qingwen being accused of manslaughter was transferred to the Criminal Division of the District Court for trial yesterday. Judge Zeng Zuwei is in charge, and the trial is scheduled for February 5th. Su was originally a communications officer at the Eastern Economic Research Institute and was later transferred to the Garrison Command as a communications officer.

A quarrel broke out between the two sides. Zhang took out a pistol to threaten Su. The gun was taken away by onlookers. When Su saw that Zhang had no gun, he chased and beat him. Zhang fled to the window and was punched in the chest by Su, causing Zhang to fall out of the window. He died from serious injuries. The police station sent him to the court for trial.

[Reported by this newspaper] The North Sichuan Road Police Branch received a tip-off a few days ago, saying that bandits were hiding in its jurisdiction.

They arrested two bandits in a nearby wooden shed on the spot. According to their confessions, their names are Zhang Douzhao and Yang Jinlong. A pistol, four bullets, and a magazine were found in Yang's pocket. They were taken to the police station for interrogation. They confessed to armed robbery and admitted to gathering bandits in Ningbo and committing multiple robberies. In November last year, they robbed the Zhang family in Qingshui Lake, Zhuang City, Ningbo, of hundreds of thousands of yuan and came to Shanghai. Soon after, they met their friend Zhang Ketian, who introduced them to the fugitive Zhi Fang.

### Zhejiang's Offshore Fisheries: Strengthening Coastal Security to Protect People's Livelihoods and Economy

[Reported by this newspaper from Hangzhou on the 29th] Zhejiang is the most developed province in China's fishing industry. Among the nine coastal provinces, it is unmatched except for Guangdong and Shandong. The fishing grounds, covering more than 40,000 square nautical miles between 27 degrees 10 minutes and 30 degrees 40 minutes north latitude, have intricate and deep harbors and a series of islands, including Nanbeiyu outside the Feiyun River and Ao River estuaries, Yuhuan Islands outside the Ou River estuary, Taizhou Islands outside the Jiaojiang and Jinqing port estuaries, Nantian and Yushan outside Sanmen Bay, Hanshan outside Juehan, and the Zhoushan Islands outside Xiangshan Port, Yong River estuary, and Hangzhou Bay. The vastness and quality of the Zhoushan fishing grounds make it the center of China's East China Sea fishing industry. The better seaports include Changzhi Port in Zhoushan, Shipu in Sanmen Bay, and Wenzhou in the Ou River estuary as the three major centers.

According to accurate statistics from the Zhejiang Construction Department, the province currently has

11,797 fishing boats of all sizes, 100,000 sea fishing households, 72,352 fishermen directly engaged in fishing, and 3 million people indirectly dependent on fishing for a living. The main catches are four types: large and small yellow croaker, ribbonfish, and cuttlefish (squid). Other catches, such as pomfret, eel, shark, croaker, flounder, jellyfish, and laver, are also abundant. The total catch in 1946 was 2,726,340 dan. The winter fishing season in 1947 was also abundant. The spring fishing season (from February to June in the lunar calendar) accounts for about one-third of the annual catch, and the winter fishing season (from September in the lunar calendar to January of the following year) accounts for two-thirds of the catch, so the total annual catch may exceed last year's.

Zhejiang's large yellow croaker is produced in the Juyu Port and Huang Dayang areas. From the vernal equinox to Lesser Fullness every year, from southeast to northwest, boats using large pu nets, small double nets, and drift nets

fish with the tides

. The output value is about 500 billion yuan (calculated at 10,000 yuan per catty, the same below). Half of them are collected by the fishing factories in Daishan and Juyu Mountain to make dried fish, which are transported fresh or salted to Ningbo, and then sold to the east and west of Zhejiang, and transported to Shanghai to sell to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Most of the small yellow croaker is concentrated in Shenjiamen, Zhoushan Islands. From late winter to early spring, large nets are used to catch them in Sheshan Yang, Taohua, Liuheng, Langgang, etc. The annual output value is about 800 billion yuan, and the sales are the same as large yellow croaker. The ribbonfish fishing grounds are in Dinghai, Changtu, and other places. From the beginning of September to the middle of November in the lunar calendar, large double boats and Fujian hook boats are used for fishing. The annual output value is about 300 billion yuan, and the sales are as above. The output value of cuttlefish is about 100 billion yuan. From February to June in the lunar calendar, trawls, cuttlefish cages, and illuminated boats and cuttlefish rafts are used in the Taizhou Islands and Zhoushan Islands for fishing, and they are sold to Jiangxi, Fujian, and various parts of Southeast Asia. The annual output of other fishes, such as pomfret, is also in the hundreds of billions of yuan. In Zhejiang's economic resources, offshore fisheries do occupy an important part.

Fishermen's lives,

apart from being more dangerous, are more prosperous than those of salt workers and farmers. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were affected by the Japanese blockade at sea, and fishing was blocked in many ways, causing harm to their livelihoods. Moreover, many fishing boats were lost, numbering 3,544. Since the victory, the Relief Administration has, at the request of various fishing groups, allocated a large amount of shipbuilding timber, and the provincial government plans to set up shipyards in Ningbo and other places to build wooden boats for relief. However, due to transportation, funding, and jurisdictional issues, progress is slower than that of a snail. The government's so-called relief: fishing loans, is also very pitiful. During the winter fishing season last year, the Agricultural Bank of China lent a total of only 1 billion yuan in Zhejiang, namely 300 million in the Wenzhou area, 200 million in the Taizhou area, and 500 million in the Ningbo area. Later, there were a few that were carried out independently by local banks. Not only are the procedures complicated, but they can only borrow 10 to 20 million, which is far from enough, so the fishermen have to rely on usurious loans. A large boat's seasonal fishing trip costs about 100 million (not including the cost of adding fishing gear). Like this

winter fish season

with abundant production, each boat can get 100 to 200 dan to 500 to 600 dan, and the market price per dan is 1 million yuan, which can make several times the profit, so they are very willing to borrow capital at high interest rates. However, during this fishing season, two hurricanes sank more than 30 fishing boats, and swept all the lives and wealth into the ocean. This is the greatest misfortune for fishermen. Anyone who has read the French novel "An Iceland Fisherman" can easily imagine the tragic emotions of these unfortunate fishermen.

Since the restoration, the government has indeed made considerable efforts in alleviating the suffering of fishermen. The establishment of fish markets is a major construction. Originally, the

greatest exploitation

of fishermen was the fishing industry, which lent capital to fishermen and forced them to buy catches at low prices, thereby making huge profits. Now, the government has established fish markets, although they are still jointly run by officials and merchants. This level of exploitation has at least been reduced a lot. What the fishermen are most eager for from the government at present is maritime security. Due to the insufficient strength of the coastal security forces themselves, the vast area, and the fleeing and lurking of pirates, it is not easy to capture them. The navy and the offshore police have failed to cooperate thoroughly. Security is always a difficult problem to solve. Fishermen have no choice but to be "ticketed" by the pirates when going out to fish, using money to accept the pirates' "protection." There is also the phenomenon of "smuggling with the connivance of anti-smuggling" occurring in the coastal areas. Therefore, how to ensure maritime security in order to protect the lifeline of the people's livelihoods and economy in the coastal areas of Zhejiang is the greatest hope of the fishermen and also a major responsibility of the government.

### He Yushu Arrives in Wuxi to Inspect Rice Market Transactions

[Reported by this newspaper from Zhenjiang on the 29th] He Yushu, Director of the Provincial Department of Land and Food, recently stated that Wuxi is not only a source of grain for Nanjing and Shanghai, but also a large warehouse in the southeastern half of the country. The fluctuation of grain prices is of great importance to military rations and people's food. On the 28th, he personally went to Wuxi to supervise market transactions and decided that the central government, the provincial government, and local governments would jointly try to suppress grain prices to prevent the surge during the Lunar New Year. It is also reported that in order to cooperate with the central government in promoting grain production and enrich military rations and people's food, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has selected 22 counties and cities in the south and north of the Yangtze River and divided them into grain production areas, including the Zhenchang, Susong, Huaiyang, and Xuzhou areas.

### Li Keming: Same Surname, Same Name, Double Case

[Reported by this newspaper from Qingpu on the 29th] Li Keming, the leader of the 2nd Group of the "People's Liberation Army Qing Song Brigade," was arrested by the county authorities in Zhujie Xinqiao on November 6th last year. At the beginning of this year, the Songhu Garrison Command also arrested and sent a bandit leader named Li Keming to the county for filing, forming a double case. After interrogation by the military law office, it was learned that the latter was indeed a bandit leader, and the former was a hooligan from Zhushu, with the same name. A few days ago, Wu, the wife of the fake bandit leader Li Keming, was arrested for being involved with bandits. She specifically submitted a request to the county government for bail for her husband. The county government, according to the report, stated that although Li Keming of Zhujie was not a bandit leader, he usually relied on his power to bully and oppress the local area, and was a hooligan and traitor who could not be easily forgiven. Therefore, he will continue to be detained.

Shops and residents along the way hung national flags and firecrackers resounded, with enthusiastic emotions. The recruits wore new grass-green cotton uniforms and were full of energy and happiness. The heads of various institutions all walked to the station to see them off in accordance with the law.

[Reported by this newspaper from Changshu on the 29th] Due to the urgent deadline for the conscription work here, the township heads of each district are doing their best to achieve success.

[Reported by this newspaper from Guangzhou on the 29th] According to reports from Lechang County: The rich bituminous coal mines in Lechang County, according to surveys, if they can be mined in large quantities, can meet the needs of the whole country for ten years. Before the war, the mines were organized by the provincial government to attract investment, and the Yuebei Coal Mine Company carried out mining on a considerable scale, but since the Japanese occupied Guangdong, they were completely destroyed. After the restoration, the Resource Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Government cooperated in investing and renamed it Lingnan Coal Mine Company. New equipment was installed, and excavation began last winter, and three coal caves have been formed. A large amount of equipment has now been shipped in and ordered to increase production to meet the needs of the Yuehan Railway. Song Ziwen has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to allocate 100 billion yuan to expand the Gouyadong branch line from Pingshi to the mining area. Once completed, the coal needs of the three provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei can be fully supplied.

### Jiangyin Autonomous Demonstration Town: The Town Mayor is a Woman

[Reported by this newspaper from Jiangyin on the 29th] Yangku in Dongxiang was originally a fortress city, built during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty to defend against Japanese pirates. It was demolished at the beginning of the Republic of China. The town's population and commerce are the crown of Dongxiang. County Magistrate Xu Wangshu designated it as an autonomous demonstration town and appointed Xia Yizhi as the town mayor. Xia is a woman, 46 years old, graduated from Southeast University, and served as a member of the Design and Assessment Committee of the Hunan Provincial Government. She has been serving as the town mayor for more than a year and has devoted herself to grassroots work in the local area. The county government has high expectations for her. She has put the most effort into searching for and arresting drug addicts and strictly prohibiting gambling. In order to set up a rural hospital, she rented the old site of the former Jixing pawnshop. When digging a well, she found a large number of hidden gold and silver ornaments. Because Mo Tingfu, a former pawnshop shareholder, has physical problems, he insisted on returning all of them, which has not yet been resolved.

### Heavy Snowfall in Haizhou: Snow Accumulates to One and a Half Feet on Level Ground, Unprecedented in Decades

Disaster Victims Freeze to Death; Boat Crew Drowns

[Our Haizhou Correspondent, 24th] From the 22nd onward, Haizhou experienced heavy snowfall for two consecutive days. On the morning of the 24th, the weather finally cleared, with snow accumulating to a depth of one and a half to one and two-thirds feet on level ground, an unprecedented snowfall in decades. Automobiles were unable to run, and prices of goods soared. Among the refugees from Xinpu and the impoverished, numbering over ten thousand, many were dying from cold and hunger each day.

### Flour Prices Rise in Bengbu, Creating a Black Market, Affecting the People's Food Supply; Representatives from Various Industries Petition

[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 28th] With the cold weather and approaching end of the year, there is extreme panic regarding food supplies in northern Anhui, presenting an unsettling situation. The number of refugees in the market town is no less than one hundred thousand, suffering from both hunger and cold, a truly unbearable sight. The Xinfeng flour mills have repeatedly increased flour prices, gradually creating a black market that affects the people's food supply, arousing public indignation. Although the municipal government has strictly suppressed prices, they continue to outwardly comply but inwardly resist, showing no concern for the poor. The directors and supervisors of over forty industry guilds in the city once gathered to discuss countermeasures, appointing Ding Fowu, Xia Xiangzhai, Mu Daomei, and four others as representatives to petition in Nanjing, preparing to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Ministry of Food for the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate and severely punish them. According to statements made by Fowu and others, Bengbu is located near the north, and most residents consume wheat-based foods. Northern Anhui is traditionally a wheat-producing area, and the transportation of coal from Huainan is also more convenient than elsewhere. Since the raw material prices for flour production are lower than in Nanjing and Shanghai, the price of flour should also be lower than in Nanjing and Shanghai. However, the Shixing and Xinfeng factories have been blinded by profit, disregarding the livelihood of the people, and during this period of suppression of rebellion, they single-mindedly manipulated prices, raising the price of each bag of flour from 420,000 to 645,000 yuan within half a month, and frequently halting sales to deliberately create a black market, not only hindering the people's food supply but also promoting social unrest. They have decided to go to Nanjing on the 28th to petition and request the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate, and they will not stop until their goals are achieved. It is learned that the municipal authorities have intervened to mediate and will strictly suppress flour prices to maintain the people's food supply, but it remains to be seen whether the Shixing and Xinfeng factories will comply.

### Kunshan Self-Defense Team Soldiers Disrupt Restaurant, Arrested

[Our Kunshan Correspondent, 29th] Shu Chunguang, a platoon leader of the Self-Defense Corps, and Chen Dingzhen, a soldier, created a disturbance at the "Yijia Chun" restaurant on the morning of the 27th.

### Jiangsu Province's Provincial-Level Agencies Adopt Monthly Staff Reduction Method

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 29th] Staff reductions in Jiangsu Province's provincial-level agencies are inevitable as they have received orders from the central government. Yesterday, this reporter specifically inquired with a personnel official from the provincial government, who stated that the province's provincial-level agencies are complying with central government orders, stipulating a monthly reduction of 5 percent, requiring a 25 percent reduction within five months. The province originally intended to consider the actual situation of each agency and make a one-time reduction, but due to various difficulties, it has been decided to adopt a gradual monthly reduction method. Based on the current number of personnel in each agency, approximately 800 to 900 people will need to be reduced. The methods for compensating those laid off and issuing severance pay are currently being carefully considered by each agency and will be decided after being submitted to Chairman Wang for approval. It is also learned that there is talk of downsizing the provincial government, with plans to reduce it to four departments (Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction) and three offices (Secretariat, Land and Grain, and Accounting). According to informed sources, although the Ministry of Interior Affairs has drafted a "Provincial Government Reform Plan" for the adjustment of provincial-level agencies, it was not promulgated due to the imminent constitutional government. Regarding the adjustment of provincial-level agencies, the Ministry of Interior Affairs has no other instructions, so it is unlikely to be realized before the establishment of the constitutional government.

### 1947 Statistics for Elementary Schools in the City

38 Municipal Schools with 535 Classes Added; Over 300 Private Schools with Over 1,400 Classes Added

[Dahua News Agency] The Municipal Education Bureau announced that the city's national schools have not reached the standard of one school per district, and there are still not enough places for all school-age children who wish to enroll. Therefore, the 1947 work plan will continue to focus on increasing the number of national schools and classes, admitting as many school-age children as possible, and encouraging private individuals to establish schools. After a year of effort, the increase in national schools has been limited by funding, and the expected goals could not be achieved. However, the increase in private elementary schools has been considerable. This year, 38 national schools with 535 classes were added, accommodating 22,718 students. 330 private elementary schools with 1,446 classes were added, accommodating more than 53,000 students. In total, there are currently 321 municipal elementary schools in the city with 3,546 classes and 161,596 students, an increase of 20% compared to last year and approximately 300% compared to the time of victory. There are currently 1,162 private elementary schools with 5,051 classes and 232,014 students, an increase of approximately 30% compared to last year and approximately 40% compared to the time of victory. The percentage of school-age children attending school has reached over 86% (the number of schoolchildren in the city has increased by more than 20% this year, so while there are more children enrolled, the percentage of school dropouts has been limited). In addition, the percentage of national education funding in the city's municipal funding has increased nearly doubled compared to before the war, while the number of students in municipal elementary schools has increased more than 165% compared to before the war (there were 62,151 students in municipal elementary schools in the spring of 1947).

### Teachers College Relocation to Beijing and Upgrade to University Movement; Students in the Deep Mountains of Nanyue Make Appeals Again

[Our Nanyue Correspondent] The National Teachers College of Nanyue in Hunan Province has repeatedly appealed to the authorities for the "Relocation to Beijing and Upgrade to University Movement." Recently, a declaration to strike in wait for orders was issued. The original text is as follows:

"Now we express our hopes and desires with grief and prayer.

We know that striking is a painful measure. However, due to the compulsion of circumstances, we have no choice but to resort to this last resort. We remember that when a strike was brewing last year, the Ministry of Education gave us a considerable response, but a year has passed, and hope has once again become a bubble. Therefore, today, we vow to again fight for the minimum living conditions of this college with heavy sacrifices.

In the current stage of "Education First in the Period of National Construction," sacred and great responsibilities have fallen on our shoulders. This group of normal school students are not only receiving this professional training to engage in the practical work of education, but also bears the important mission of studying education academics. We deeply feel the difficulty of future responsibilities and the hardship of the current environment, and we cannot but appeal, request, and protest. The strike is an expression of the entire action!

The National Teachers College, which grew out of its own blood and tears during the Anti-Japanese War, although traveling and displaced along the road, has indeed taken on a sacred responsibility in education. This excellent and nationally-oriented higher normal education institution should have moved to the capital and expanded its scale after the victory. However, due to the prejudices of one or two people in charge, it was placed in the deep mountains of Nanyue, suffocating our breath, restricting our development, and depriving us of the responsibilities we bear and the rights we deserve. Nanyue is just a Buddhist jungle and a scenic spot, not a place where higher education institutions can develop. In the past year or more, we have not only endured many material hardships, but also the original professors have left one after another, and the newly hired professors have been unable to move forward. In addition, diseases have spread, giving us great spiritual blows. Who is to blame? It is the fault of the mountain! We want this college to have an ideal future, and the only way to do that is to leave Nanyue and move to Nanjing as soon as possible!

Since higher normal education is a kind of professional training and bears the important mission of cultivating teachers for secondary schools and educational administrators and studying educational academics, it should be given corresponding cultivation and reasonable development. This college has undergone nine years of hard work, and all aspects have shown excellent results. The facts are there, and there is no need to repeat them. If China wants to have brilliant achievements in education in the future, it is necessary to establish several large-scale normal universities. Concerned about the future of national education and mindful of the important mission of this college, we hope to immediately upgrade to a university!

We are unwilling to say that the government has any prejudice against education! We are unwilling to say what percentage of the national budget is allocated to education! However, all the faculty and students of this college are already in an extremely difficult situation. We are ragged and hungry, but we bear heavy responsibilities. We have hope, we have confidence, but this college cannot get to actively engage in construction. This is all because of insufficient funding! In the midst of soaring prices, what is the use of 100,000 yuan per month for non-staple food and 3,000 yuan per year for lamp oil! What is the use of 100,000 yuan per term for pocket money and 400,000 yuan per year for uniforms! This is all the Ministry of Education's "generous kindness" to us that is "beneficial but not costly"! Education is inherently a poor career, but it should not be frozen and starved. Education needs stability and should not be without development. Confining us in the secluded valley of Nanyue without giving us the minimum living conditions, is this the national education plan? This time, President Pi went to Beijing, carrying only our basic demands, but the negotiations were fruitless. We should protest against the authorities' neglect of education!

Since Nanyue is not a space for us to survive, and there are higher normal colleges in neighboring Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces that can develop border education, it is not necessary for this college, which is national in nature, to stay in Nanyue for a long time. More than a year of mountain life has given us too much pain and made us sacrifice greatly. Today, it has reached an intolerable time. We have started a strike on January 14th and will wait for orders and will not stop until we get a reasonable response! In order to fight for the necessary conditions for survival, we do not hesitate to pay this heavy price, but we only consider striking to be a painful measure!"

### King of Tennis Goes Pro: The Brilliant Record of Kramm's Life

[Special Article from This Newspaper] Former US Davis Cup main player and amateur tennis champion Jack Kramm went pro last October, and has since been touring the United States with the contemporary professional tennis leader Riggs, fighting head to head. To date, in a total of twenty-one encounters, Kramm has won twelve times, temporarily taking the lead.

The news of Kramm's transition to the professional world had been rumored for a long time, until early August of last year, when Kramm himself provided an answer: "I will maintain my amateur tennis player status until 1947." Because within that year, Kramm still had to shoulder two major tasks: from August 30 to September 1, he served as the top player in the US team at Forest Hills, and competed with the strong Australian team to defend the "Davis Cup"; secondly, in the Forest Hills International Tennis Tournament held from September 5 to 14, he had to fight to maintain his "men's singles throne" title.

### The American People Hold Understanding

The American people mostly have an understanding attitude towards Kramm's preparation to enter the professional world, because the year before, Coetzee and Van Rlot relied on their own strength to return the "Davis Cup," which had been lost for many years, from Australia back to the United States, and this great achievement still makes them grateful. At that time, it was rumored that the professional world was willing to offer 50,000 US dollars to ask Kramm to go pro. - Another saying is that Riggs (the current international professional tennis champion) once told Kramm, advising him to give up his amateur status, guaranteeing that he would be able to harvest 50,000 US dollars for him within a year. Therefore, in order to defend last year's Davis Cup for the United States, Kramm, in his personal capacity, had in fact lost a considerable "annual salary."

This twenty-seven-year-old, golden-haired California boy, six feet one inch tall and weighing one hundred and sixty-eight pounds, has already become a father, so he has to strive for a position for the happiness of his family, and Kramm had to consider that cash wealth that tempted him to go pro.

Kramm's biological father worked for the "Union Pacific Railroad Company" for thirty-five years. No matter how difficult the situation, he would definitely try to provide him with a development opportunity for his son's innate love of sports. When Kramm held a basketball in his hand, Old Kramm built a basketball court in the backyard for him; if he saw that the son was interested in baseball, the father would play with him.

When Kramm was twelve years old, once, he returned home from a football game with a bruised and bleeding nose. His mother was shocked to see this and quickly used three dollars and fifty cents to buy him a tennis racket, and they played together as father and son.

### Kramo's Posture: Planning to Open a Shop in the Future

Now that Kramo has become famous in one fell swoop, he plans to raise funds in the future to open a "Sports Equipment Shop," with his father acting as manager. He says, "In the business world, the old man's mind is better than mine."

Before the war, Kramo studied at the University of Southern California. He currently has no intention of continuing his studies. Newspaper articles on tennis and some books on hunting experiences summarize his current reading time. For half his life, he has single-mindedly pursued one firm and sincere idea: "I want to become the best tennis player in the world."

Long before he reached the age of sixteen, Kramo had already gained the opportunity to compete against veteran predecessors such as Van Rines, Tilden, and Pan Lai, receiving their guidance. Van Rines even provided coaching matches twice a week – a necessary course for the birth of the second generation of California tennis, with Van imparting to him "attack and power."

At the age of seventeen, Kramo won both the "All-American Youth" and "All-American Schoolboy" singles championships and was ranked as the tenth-best player in the United States. He was also hailed as the reincarnation of Van Rines because Kramo's appearance closely resembled Van's. Kramo also partnered with another California tennis player, Schroder, in doubles, winning the national championship for two consecutive years. At that time, he was only nineteen years old, but he was not satisfied with this.

In 1943, he reached the All-American singles final but unfortunately lost to Schroeder due to skin poisoning. After that, he joined the Coast Guard and experienced five Pacific landings, holding a racket for thirteen months.

The year before last, he went to England to participate in the Wimbledon tournament. Due to a skin disease outbreak, he lost to Czech player Trolley, but Kramo himself made a statement saying that it was Trolley who defeated him, and it had nothing to do with the skin disease. He did not resort to excuses, nor did he need to shirk responsibility. Later, facts proved that in the Lynn Hill Conference in September of the year before last, he indeed won the singles championship, creating the great achievement of winning five singles matches and losing only one set. In December, he and Schroder attended the Davis Cup, winning back the championship for the United States and establishing indelible merit.

### Having Achieved His Long-Cherished Wish, He Announces His Retirement

Last July, the Wimbledon Cup was held in England. As a result of the global players competing, the men's singles championship was still held by Kramo. London newspapers praised him as one of the best players in Wimbledon history. From August 30th to September 1st, Kramo and his old partner Schroder represented the United States team in the defense of the Tai Cup against the Australian team, achieving a complete victory in singles, defeating the Australian team by four to one. On September 14th, in the Lynn Hill All-American Lawn Tennis Singles Championship final, he defeated Parker by three to two, retaining the championship. Having achieved his long-cherished wish, Kramo used this brilliant record to transfer to the professional world. (Qian Changnian)

With Strong Strength, It Once Greatly Defeated Incas; Basketball Committee Arranges Confrontation Schedule

In order to improve the level of basketball in this city, the Basketball Committee had previously telegraphed to invite the Canadian Red Rose team to Shanghai, but the team declined due to vacation reasons.

As a result, Duros easily defeated Incas by more than 20 points. Its strong strength can be imagined. The Basketball Committee revealed that it is already arranging the confrontation schedule and will soon decide to have the leading strong teachers in Shanghai compete against it.

### Application Cases for Finished Product Acquisition: The Fourth United Branch Started Handling Yesterday

Preliminary Review by the Industry and Banking Bureau and then Transferred to the United Headquarters for Review

In order to rescue manufacturers in this city who are generally facing difficult situations, the government previously drafted "Measures for Shanghai National Industry and Banking Bureau to Collect Finished Products from Manufacturers on Behalf of the Government" by the Fourth United Office as an emergency measure to cope with the Lunar New Year. The Fourth United Office held a meeting the night before last, presided over by Hua Gongyun, to convene the responsible persons of various industry and banking bureaus to discuss technical matters related to the implementation of the acquisition of finished products from manufacturers. Cai Gongchun, Li Renzai, Huangfu, Diao Minren, Fang Tinghua, Ma Jiping, Sun Rui, Qian Zuling, Pan Zhonglin, and others attended. It was resolved that starting yesterday (30th), the various industry and banking bureaus will conduct a preliminary review first, and then transfer it to the Fourth United Headquarters for review. It was also decided that starting on the 2nd of next month, the Fourth United Branch will hold a meeting every afternoon to exchange views and review these application cases. The deadline for application is the 7th of next month. The application forms for various manufacturers have been printed and can be obtained from the industry and banking bureaus as soon as possible.

[Report from this newspaper] After Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan issued a statement on US aid for self-help a few days ago, both China and foreign countries paid close attention. Among the ten items set for the implementation of financial and economic reforms, the fourth item is "The stirring of supplies must be strengthened and the scope of the section must be expanded to prevent speculation and sharp rises in prices." According to this statement, it is heard that the government will implement stricter controls on daily necessities such as rice, fuel, and cloth in the future in order to grasp materials and stabilize prices.

### Correcting Resolutions of the Cotton Spinning Industry: Chairman Yuan Issues a Statement, Believing That the Government Cannot Accept Six Opinions

[Report from this newspaper] Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Management Committee issued a statement on the resolutions of the Cotton Spinning Association, saying: The resolutions of the general meeting of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association regarding the various management rules of this office are unreasonable and should be corrected as follows:

The resolution of the general meeting of the members is that entrusted spinning and weaving should be carried out by contract, and it is difficult to accept anything that exceeds the scope of entrusted spinning and weaving.

The central government's decision to implement full control of cotton yarn and cloth this time is an integral part of the overall policy of economic suppression of chaos. Since the government has added controls, it can exercise everything by command. From the government's point of view, it must be thoroughly implemented and no obstruction or resistance is allowed. How can it be regarded as an ordinary commercial event and requested to be carried out by contract? Its unreasonableness is obvious.

Recommending representatives to draft and publish a declaration on the crisis of this industry.

The government is always supporting and caring for the national textile industry. The reason why I came out to preside over this time is also based on this idea, hoping to make this textile industry increasingly prosperous while still managing it. At the beginning of my tenure, I have sincerely told my colleagues that there is no intention of destroying or exploiting them in the slightest. What is stipulated in the various implementation rules of this committee has absolutely taken care of the interests and status of manufacturers. The declaration of the textile crisis is really an unnecessary worry.

Recommending representatives to state their opinions and requests.

In order to seek thorough cooperation and integrate officials and businessmen, I have tried my best to adopt opinions that can be accepted within the possible range. Facts have proven that the association's various requirements in the past have been met, and there is no need to say more. The six opinions raised by the Sixth District Association this time are close to coercion. From the government's point of view, it is really impossible to accept them. I have to express my deep expectations to all members of the association. The heads of the association's factories are mostly well-known and enlightened figures in society. They should have already clearly distinguished between public and private matters, and not completely focus on their own private interests, just like the previous joint distribution and price negotiation work, which are often opposed. Therefore, it is hoped that the association's few members who do not understand very well can be enlightened at any time to avoid misunderstandings.

There is no need to set up resident factory specialists, which is considered a waste of national funds and breeds malpractices. Whether the implementation of management policies can be thorough depends on whether the management methods are suitable. In order to understand the working conditions of each factory, this committee has stipulated that personnel should be stationed in the factories, but the association publicly opposed it on the grounds that there is no need to set them up, which is ridiculous. Moreover, this committee is extremely strict in the assessment, selection, and training of the personnel to be stationed in the factories. They have not yet been dispatched. How can they know that there will be malpractices? As for the waste of national funds, it has nothing to do with the manufacturers and there is no need to use it as an excuse. This is completely a statement that does not understand the position and despises the government.

Raw cotton in each factory is scarce and needs to be replenished urgently. If the Yarn Management Committee cannot supply it in time, they will be forced to stop work, and the Yarn Management Committee should be fully responsible for the serious consequences.

This office's unified purchase of raw cotton is to supply the needs of each yarn factory. The second quarter's cotton allocation and the General Office's cotton have already been transferred and allocated by the Central Bank. In the future, this committee will take over and, of course, will allocate it according to regulations. If we talk about being forced to stop work at this time, it is obviously an alarmist statement, obstructing important political affairs, and attempting to undermine the implementation of comprehensive management. If this kind of situation occurs, this committee will have to enforce the law in order to implement administrative orders.

In short, this committee hopes that all members of the Sixth District Association will cooperate sincerely so that this textile industry can thrive and sweep away the previous habits of seeking exorbitant profits and disregarding the overall situation. This is what I sincerely desire.

### Representatives of the Cotton Spinning Association Visited Chairman Yuan Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] Tang Xinghai, Rong Hongyuan, Rong Erren, Guo Dihuo, Liu Jingji, Wang Zhuyi, and others from the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association visited Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Management Committee yesterday morning at 11:00 am to present their opinions and request that they be accepted. Chairman Yuan expressed that reasonable consideration could be given, and immediately instructed the responsible department to discuss with the Sixth District Association at the Yarn Management Committee this morning at 10:00 am in order to reduce obstacles and facilitate progress.

Another report: In order to start the management of cotton yarn and cloth business and seek cooperation and contact with various places, Chairman Yuan Liang of the committee specially invited important personnel from the municipal government, the garrison headquarters, the Central Bank, and the Social Affairs Bureau to the meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 pm to discuss everything, and exchanged views with Chairman Fang Zhi and Speaker Pan Gongzhan at noon.

### Board Meeting of the Textile Construction Corporation Scheduled for This Afternoon

[Report from this newspaper] The China Textile Construction Corporation is scheduled to hold a board meeting this afternoon at 3:00 pm. Chen Qitian, chairman of the company, will come to Shanghai this morning and preside over the meeting this afternoon. It is heard that in addition to reporting on the production and sales business of the Textile Construction Corporation in the past year, issues such as the company's fuel treatment will also be discussed at the meeting.

### Cotton Yarn Slightly Increased; Fine Cloth Slightly Rose

Yesterday, in the cotton yarn market, the Textile Construction Corporation opened for sale as usual, and the allocation was reduced. In the market situation, due to the still loose money supply, buyers took advantage of the low price to absorb some, and the local dealers also made up for some of their positions. However, the weaving factories' appetite was mediocre, and the market trend rose circuitously. By the time of closing, dealers sold out their profits, and it fell slightly.

Finally, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to rise by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 58.8 million yuan. Bao Guang rose by 800,000 yuan. In addition, 20-count Shuang Ma, 16-count, Guangming, and 10-count and other grades all stopped falling and rose. However, the prices of 40-count and 32-count grades fell mostly because they were still stagnant.

Yesterday, in the cotton market, the morning opening transaction was very clear. Then, the Hankou dealers absorbed 30 to 40 pieces of Si Junzi serge, and the price rose. However, by the noon closing, retail investors sold out. The local dealers were reluctant to absorb them due to the approaching end of the period, and the market was not supported. North Road buyers slightly purchased 12-pound Wu Fu and other fine cloths. As a result, the prices of Blue Chicken Caiqiu and other grades of fine cloths rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan and 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Serge and Zhigong also rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The rest of the cloths showed little rise or fall.

Raw Cotton Stagnant

Yesterday, the raw cotton market was stable. The Textile Construction Corporation had already opened prices, but private yarn factories still had no intention of entering. There were not many transactions by colleagues, and the transaction was stagnant again. The price was slightly soft, and the transaction was 660 bales. The delivery price to the factory was 6.25 million for Jingyang, the spot price was 5.993 million for Lingbao, 6.03 million for Jingyang, and 1.25 million to 1.26 million for Zhoupu seed cotton.

### Rayon Slightly Decreased; Factory-Managed Silk Goods Were Soft

The rayon market initially showed a revolving pattern yesterday, but as a result, it decreased slightly. The opening price of 120-count Xu Zi Right Light was 89 million yuan in the morning, and there were also transactions at 95 million yuan. Later, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, the closing price fell to 70 million yuan. There was not much change in the afternoon, and the final selling price was 77.5 million yuan.

Factory-managed silk market was slightly weak yesterday, and the transaction was still rare. There were no transactions for various grades of goods with orders, and the asking price was similar to the previous day. For spot goods, the first-class five-dan head was purchased by Mei Ya for five bales yesterday at a price of 91.5 million yuan. The high-end retail price was around 1 million yuan, and the mid-range retail price was around 90 million yuan, with only a few bales traded.

The price of 20-count Golden Double Chicken (poor quality) was 32.5 million yuan per piece, which did not exceed the negotiated price range.

### Shanghai Stocks Opened Flat and Weak; Buying Sentiment Turned Strong at Closing

Shanghai stocks still stood high at the opening price yesterday due to the two-day interest price. The pre-market was weak and unable to rise, and most of the time was spent in weakness. The same was true in the aftermarket. Before the closing, the strength of Nos. 148, 43, and 193 bought back, and the market ended at a high price.

The morning opening was still weak. Yong Yarn debuted at 730 yuan and 727 yuan. After the opening, it gradually rose from 727 yuan and 752 yuan to 747 yuan and 767 yuan. The off-market interest price still opened at 3.3 cents and 3.75 cents, falling back to 735 yuan and 754 yuan. Nos. 89 and other numbers continued to buy spot and forward, and the price rose again to 748 yuan and 770 yuan. However, Nos. 130 and other numbers closed at a high price, and the noon closing still retreated to 733 yuan and 757 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the five-year decline limit had a rebound, lowering it by 10%. China Textile Datong Tongyi underwear was still flat, and the rise and fall of the remaining stocks were small. The forward stock Jingfu rose slightly, Xin Guang was still flat, and the rest fell slightly. The off-market prices of various unlisted stocks were still flat and weak.

In the aftermarket, Yong Yarn was sold from 746 yuan and 764 yuan to 743 yuan and 762 yuan. The difference in national bank exchange was limited, rising to 749 yuan and 768 yuan. No. 36 and other numbers were still sold, and they retreated to low prices of 742 yuan and 759 yuan. Nos. 148 and other numbers bought spot, and No. 193 also strongly bought forward. Once the reverse started, the buying momentum suddenly became strong, rising to high prices of 761 yuan and 780 yuan. Nos. 157 and other numbers applied pressure again, retreating to closing prices of 755 yuan and 779 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning closing, the spot stocks Yong Yarn, China Textile, Xinhe, China Silk, Commercial Press, Xin Guang, Lu An, China France, and Xinhua rose slightly. Wu He rose by half, Tongyi, Mei Ya, Hua Feng, Jingfu, Qin Xing, and Zhabei rose by half a percent. Hua Xin was still flat, and the rest fell slightly. There were no transactions in the forward stocks Hua Guan and Mei Ya, and the rest rose slightly. Various unlisted stocks in the off-market still showed a flat and weak state.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Stagnant

Government bonds were stagnant yesterday with little change. The unified Bing opened at 66,000 in the morning, falling from 67,000 to 62,000, and then revolved around the closing price of the previous day. Compared with the previous closing, Jia, Yi, Bing, and Wu were all flat, and the unified Ding fell by 1,000 yuan. The transaction was only 3 million.

Foreign stocks were mediocre yesterday, with little change. Hong Kong Electric did not change. Yi Yarn opened at 56,000 in the morning, and then weakened slightly. Foreign firms absorbed, and Guangdong firms supplied. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yi Yarn, British Union, Huadefeng Paper, Yi Beer, Shipping, and Steel fell slightly. Ye Guang Tram and Telephone showed little change.

### Wuxi Commodity Prices Rebounded

[Report from Wuxi, 30th] After He Yushu approved the price limit of white rice to be raised to 1.35 million, the National Bank issued more than 5 billion yuan again, and the money supply eased, so commodity prices rebounded. White rice was 1.417 million, Yangxian rice was 1.397 million, Buxian rice was 1.337 million, Baiyuan was 1.487 million, Japonica rice was 617,000, Yuan rice was 645,000, flour was 650,000, soybean oil was 3.44 million, cotton yarn was 35.4 million, and wheat was 1.63 million.

### Chebai Clearing Plate Fell

Due to the price of the combined allocation of the fifth and sixth phases of the He Company on Thursday, although the adjustment increased by 60,000 yuan, the chips increased, and Huaba was all available, so the market fell instead. For example, the lowest discount for a stack of semi-white was 45,000 yuan, and later it was 30,000 yuan. Other Shangluo were between 120,000 yuan. The association's clearing plate was 1.655 million yuan for spot 24 coarse white, 120,000 yuan for small. The price of 4.5 white bagged was 1.68 million yuan, and the price of 20 Taiwan sand was 1.63 million yuan, 30,000 to 40,000 yuan for small. The price of Shanti green was 1.45 million to 430,000 yuan, the price of Chichi was 1.4 million yuan, the price of Diao Qing was 1.378 million yuan, the price of Shunde Qing was 1.42 million yuan, and the price of Wen Qing was 1.33 million to 1.29 million yuan.

Tea Market Steady and Smart

The various domestic teas that were fiercely hoarded by local and foreign buyers yesterday were still active in the market due to the still strong buying sentiment. In terms of prices, the sellers insisted on a firm stance due to the scarcity of goods. Although they did not continue to advance, they were still more stable than before. Looking at the future, it still looks promising. As for the foreign-owned tea market, the situation has always been calm, because exporters are still hesitant, and the owners are also holding on. The market is standing firm.

### Cigarettes and Soap Continue to Fall Due to Oversupply

Yesterday, in the cigarette market, the prices of non-industry goods fell at the morning opening. Many who were short on funds sold out. It was also heard that Yongtaihe, Huacheng, and other factories would have a large number of shipments. Colleagues' absorption turned sluggish. As a result, the price of ten British Old Knife Two Cigarettes continued to fall by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The rest of the Chinese and foreign cigarettes also fell, ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan.

In the daily necessities soap market, due to the end of the month and the approaching end of the general period, the funds were locally short. Floating households stopped entering and turned out, and there were also sales of goods of the same quality. There were plenty of chips, and all parties were reluctant to enter, so the market was unable to rise. As a result, the prices of Gubben Arrow Knife Two Soaps fell by 10,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. In addition, the prices of Meili Henry and other soaps also fell slightly. The markets for Guanghua and Xiangmao soaps were firmer. Matches were also stagnant in sales, and both new and old brands fell. The price of kerosene was too high, and many people sold it off, so the market was flat and weak.

### Industrial Oil Sales Stagnant

In the industrial raw material market, the approaching end of the Lunar New Year and the approaching end of the general period made it difficult for various parties to trade actively, and the asking price frequently fell. The listed price of Moon Brand caustic soda was 48-49 million, but there were still no transactions. Coconut oil was slightly bullish, trading at 6 million yuan. The ground price of Vaseline was still firm, but the price of potassium persulfate had fallen by 20%.

Due to weak overseas telegrams, the local market for tung oil was still called, and the market was low. Merchants with sufficient volume still asked for 3 million yuan, and Fu Xihong asked for 3.5 million yuan, a discount of slightly more than 10%.

Due to the excessive annual sales of candle making shops, the price of Wuheben asphalt was 4.8 million per load, and the price of shredded snow was 4.5 million. Although the price was low, the transaction was still light.

Since soap factories rarely bought large quantities of beef tallow, the asking price for Bengbu oil was 4.23 million yuan, and Taotao oil could also be bought for an additional 200,000 yuan. The market was relatively strong.

### Insurance Association Held a General Meeting Yesterday

The Insurance Industry Association held a general meeting at 3:00 pm yesterday in the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. More than 200 people, including heads of various agencies and member representatives, attended. Chairman Luo Beichen delivered a speech and reported on the association's measures in the past year. Then, many proposals were discussed and dispersed at 6:00 pm.

### Rice Market First Weak then Firm; Oil Market Store Appetite Turned Eager

Yesterday, a total of more than 11,000 stone of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The market was first weak and then firm. The price of Japonica rice and indica rice was flat, and the price of Baiyuan rice was slightly weaker by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The price of flour fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Bran was actually sold out and cleared, and it was lowered by another 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were fiercely acquired by Shanshan and Xiamen, and the price rose sharply by more than 30,000 yuan. Huangdou Minwei continued to be acquired by oil factories. The local market was also strong, and Doudou rebounded by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Kedu added 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Northeastern soybeans were uniquely sought after, and the price soared by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

Tea beans were the most stagnant, falling sharply by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Red beans rose and fell abruptly, rebounding by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Jidou was still lightly traded, and continued to weaken by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was stagnant, dropping by 10,000 yuan. Corn Beiyang turned active, and the transaction was slightly smoother, rebounding by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The groundnut transaction turned active, and rebounded after weakening, rising by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Tianjin sesame was strongly absorbed, with demand exceeding supply, and the price of high-quality goods rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

The store appetite for the oil market turned eager, from weak to firm. Soybean oil rebounded by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, raw oil soared by more than 100,000 yuan, and Qing oil and sesame oil rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The supply of wheat was very scarce, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Another report: The Rice Commercial Association of this city held a board meeting on the afternoon of the 29th and resolved to issue an emergency notice, urging all colleagues to abide by the statutory profit, that is, the profit of the door sales price shall not exceed 6% of the market price cost on that day, and requested the Standing Bureau to rationalize the proposal that the retail price of rice shall not exceed 1.5 million yuan.

Literary History

### An Exploration of the Structure and Sources of Sima Qian's *Records of the Grand Historian*

— Wang Liqi

In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, The Biography of Dayuan, the Grand Historian said: "The *Yu Benji* says that the Yellow River originates from the Kunlun Mountains…" In the Hereditary House of Wei, the Grand Historian said: "I have read the Hereditary Houses saying…" Zhao Yi's *Gaiyu Congkao* argues, based on this, that "The names *Benji* (Basic Annals) and *Shijia* (Hereditary Houses) both have their origins; only the name *Zhuan* (Biographies) was created by Sima Qian himself." Yu Wanhu's *Loubitan San* states: "Xu Guang's commentary on the Biography of Lord Pingyuan quotes the Biography of Lord Wei, saying: 'Zhao Huiwen Wang's younger brother.' Thus, the name *Zhuan* also has its origins."

Now, examining the arguments of Zhao and Yu, all are open to discussion: In the *Chronological Table of the Three Dynasties* of the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the single-volume *Suoyin* (Collected Explanations) states: "Emperor Lin Xin, or Feng Xin, is written as Zu Xin in the Basic Annals, which is an error." *Xi Ben* is actually *Shi Ben* (Book of Generations), which the Lesser Sima changed to avoid the Tang taboo. In the Zuo Commentary, year 21 of Duke Xiang, it says: "Yi Yin exiled Tai Jia and served as his prime minister." Du Yu's commentary states: "Tai Jia was Tang's grandson." The *Zhengyi* (Correct Meaning) says: "That Tai Jia was Tang's grandson is recorded in the *Shi Benji* (Book of Generations Annals)." Thus, *Shi Ben* had an *Annals* section to record the genealogies of emperors and kings, which was an old style of the *Zuo Commentary*. In the Hereditary House of Tian of Qi in the *Records of the Grand Historian*: "Duke Zhuang died in the tenth year, and his son Tai Gong He took the throne." The *Suoyin* states: "According to the *Xi Ben* (Genealogical Book) and *Xi Jia* (Genealogical House) (variant name of the Shi Ben), from Chengzi to the destruction under King Jian, there were only ten generations." In the Zuo Commentary, year 3 of Duke Huan: "Duke Wu of Quwo attacked Ji, camping at Xingting; Han Wan drove the chariot, and Liang Hong was the right-hand warrior." The commentary states: "Duke Wu was the son of Zhuang Bo of Quwo, and Han Wan was the younger brother of Zhuang Bo." The *Zhengyi*: "That Duke Wu was the son of Zhuang Bo, and Han Wan was the younger brother of Zhuang Bo, is recorded in the *Shi Ben Shijia*." Also, in the Zuo Commentary, year 2 of Duke Min: "He established Duke Dai with Lu Qian Cao." The commentary states: "Duke Dai's name was Shen." The *Zhengyi*: "Duke Dai's name was Shen, is recorded in the *Shi Ben Shijia*." Also, in the Zuo Commentary, year 11 of Duke Xiang: "The ancestors of the seven surnames and twelve states." The commentary states: "Actually thirteen states, saying twelve is an error." The *Zhengyi*: "Seven surnames and thirteen states, is recorded in the *Shi Ben Shijia*." Also, in the first year of Duke Ding: "Established the Yang Gong." The commentary states: "The Yang Gong was the son of Bo Qin." The *Zhengyi*: "That the Yang Gong was the son of Bo Qin, is recorded in the *Shi Ben Shijia*." Thus, the name *Shijia* also comes from the *Zuo Commentary*, not created by Sima Qian himself. The *Book of Han*, Biography of Sima Qian, eulogy says: "Therefore, Sima Qian relied on the *Zuo Commentary* and *Guoyu* and excerpted from the *Shi Ben*." (The *Book of Later Han*, Biography of Ban Biao, says, "The Grand Historian Sima Qian excerpted from the *Zuo Commentary* and *Guoyu*, and revised the *Shi Ben*.") This shows that it was well known. As for Xu Guang quoting the Biography of Lord Wei, this was probably also from the *Shi Ben*. The Hereditary House of Wei in the *Records of the Grand Historian* says: "The grandson of Huanzi was called Wenhou Du." The *Suoyin*: "The *Xi Ben* (genealogical book) says: 'Huanzi gave birth to Wenhou Si.' Its biography says: 'Ruzi Lei was the son of Wei Ju.' This is also different from this genealogical line." It is clear that *Shi Ben* contained biographies. And the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Biography of Boyi*, the first entry, the Grand Historian says: "I am saddened by the intentions of Boyi. Having seen the lost poems, one can feel his unusualness; its biography says: Boyi and Shuqi..." The *Suoyin*: "According to its biography, it is the *Outer Commentary of the Han Poems* and *Lüshi Chunqiu*. Its biography says..." Thus, the category of *Liezhuan* (Biographies) was probably also based on earlier precedents. The *Book of Sui*, Biography of Wei Dan, records Fan Hua's words: "The *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the writing is too brief, and it often misses the forms of events. The contemporary imitations are therefore too short. *Annals and Biographies* is a transformation of what was done by the historians Ban and Ma; it comprehensively gathers the events and meanings of an era, thoroughly understanding them. Later scholars see this as superior, so they continue to write in this style." (This probably comes from the Preface to the *Book of Later Han*.) The general idea is that "In ancient books, anything recording events, establishing arguments, and interpreting classics was called a *Zhuan*, not solely recording the deeds of one person; that which solely records one person as a *Zhuan* began with Qian." (From *Notes on the Twenty-Two Dynastic Histories*.) Wei Zong's statement that the "Annals and Biographies style was a transformation of what was done by Ban" is extremely insightful.

Zhao Yi's *Notes on the Twenty-Two Dynastic Histories* says: "The Records of the Grand Historian made ten tables, imitating the genealogical records of officials, complementing the annals and biographies." Shen Tao's *Tong Yidouzai Suibi* says, "Table (表) is like saying 'genealogy (谱),' a phonetic transformation." Now, I believe both Zhao and Shen's statements are correct. The *Book of Liang*, Biography of Liu Yao, quotes Huan Tan's *Xin Lun*: "The Grand Historian's *Chronological Table of the Three Dynasties* runs sideways and diagonally upward, all imitating the Zhou genealogies." (Also see the *Treatise on Tables and Calendars* in the *Shi Tong* and the Introduction to the *Tongzhi*.) That the Grand Historian created tables based on Zhou genealogies was already said by the Han people. Now, examining what the Grand Historian himself said he used, the Preface to the *Chronological Table of the Three Dynasties* says: "I have read genealogical records; since the Yellow Emperor, all have years. Examining their historical records and the transmission of the Five Virtues from beginning to end, the ancient texts are all different and contradictory. The Master did not discuss and order their years; how could this be empty? Therefore, using the Five Emperors' tight records, the *Shangshu* compiled generations, recording from the Yellow Emperor to the Gonghe Regency, as the *Chronological Table*." The Preface to the *Chronological Table of the Twelve Feudal Lords* says: "The Grand Historian read the *Spring and Autumn Annals* historical records and genealogies." It also says: "The Han prime minister Zhang Cang recorded historical records of the Five Virtues." And also: "Genealogical records only record generations and posthumous titles; their words are brief, wanting a complete view of the important points is difficult." The Grand Historian's Autobiography says: "The Three Dynasties were long ago, and the years cannot be examined. They were probably taken from genealogical records, I heard they were based on this, so I roughly deduced and made the *Chronological Table of the Three Dynasties*, the first." It also says, "After You and Li, the Zhou dynasty declined, and the feudal lords monopolized power; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* did not record everything. But genealogical records comprehensively recorded the waxing and waning of the Five Hegemons. Wanting to see the order of succession through generations, I made the *Chronological Table of the Twelve Feudal Lords*, the second." All of this can be examined to see the source of his materials and the reason for his style.

As for the "Treatises", the *Suoyin* to the *Treatise on Rites* says: "Treatises are the general name for the Five Classics and Six Arts. These eight treatises record the great structure of the state; Ban Gu called them *Zhi* (Records), Zhi meaning recording." The *Zhengyi* also says: "The Five Classics and Six Arts are all called 'Shu' (Treatises)." The *Treatise on Treatises and Records* in the *Shi Tong* says: "Laws, rites, music, customs, mountains, and rivers, are sought in writings, originating from the Three Rites. And when Ban Gu and Sima Qian wrote history, they separately created Treatises and Records. Examining what they recorded, they mostly followed the Rites Classics. And outside of the Records and Biographies, there are things not fully covered; single words and phrases are fully recorded here. Speaking of their thoroughness and breadth, one truly believes in the author's vast knowledge." Now, I believe that the explanations of the *Suoyin*, *Zhengyi*, and *Shi Tong* are quite acceptable. Most of the Five Classics and Six Arts are books explaining institutions and laws; the Grand Historian's Eight Treatises, not only is their grand name based on the classics, but the sources they drew upon can also be found in the classics. After Ban Gu's book, there were those who directly explored the meaning of the Grand Historian's name of "Treatises" and called them "Dian" (Canon); their name is closer to the ancient usage than Ban Gu's *Zhi* and Cai Yong's intention.

The above describes several aspects; regarding the exploration of the structure and sources of the Grand Historian's book, perhaps one can gain some understanding. And the *Wenxin Diaolong*, *Treatise on History*, says: "Extending to the Grand Historian Tan, the world only holds to brevity; Zichang continued his ambition, discerningly ordering the emperors' actions. Comparing to Yao's calling [officials] to the Canon, their positions mix with the middle-ranked worthies; emulating the classics in binding titles, their writing is not like the original sages. Therefore, he took his model from the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, generally calling it *Annals*. The title of *Annals* is also a grand title." The Qing scholar Yan Shishu, continuing Yan He's explanation, argued that the Grand Historian's Basic Annals took its model from the *Lüshi Chunqiu*; also see *Yuan Xiang Tong Yi Lu*, volume two. Zhang Xuecheng of Kuaiji, in his *Xiaochou Tongyi*, also said, "The book of Lü is what Sima Qian took as his model: the Twelve Basic Annals imitate its Twelve Monthly Records, the Eight Treatises imitate its Eight Overviews; the Seventy Biographies imitate its Six Discussions; thus, there is also a slight bit of eclecticism." These are all baseless arguments.

### Two Letters Discussing "Yu Yi"

— Hu Shi

Mr. Yang Shuda Sends to Mr. Qian Xuantong

Mr. Xuantong:

The other day I heard Mr. Hu Shi explain that the "Yu" character in "Yu Yi Cai Pin, Yu Zhao Yu Zhi" etc. is "in what place" and that the tone is extremely similar. But in translating "Yu" as "in what place," I do not know how Mr. Hu explains the character "Yi". I think that the character "Yu" still maintains the meaning of the word "zai" (in), while the character "Yi" can have the explanation of "what place." Further, "Xia zui qi ru tai" (How can we blame Xia?), "Jin wang qi ru tai" (How can the current king be thus?) Sima Qian translates "Ru Tai" as "Nai He" (What to do). In the Book of Han, "Ru he bu kuang" (If they were not to correct him), in Fa Yan, "Yan min zhi zi qi ru tai" (What can be done about the sons of Yan Min?) "Ru Tai" all have the meaning of "Nai He." Considering the character "Tai" from the perspective of "mu" (eye), it already has the meaning of "He" (what, which), then the character "Mu" and "He" have the same sound, and it also ought to have the meaning of the character "He." Having the meaning of "He" can also be extended to have the meaning of "what place." (Such as the character "Yan") Thus, "Yu Yi Cai Pin? Yu Zhao Yu Zhi. Yu Yi Qiu Zhi? Yu Lin Zhi Xia" the character "Yu" in the above and below sentences can be uniformly explained, and the character "Yi" has more basis, and will not become redundant. I do not know what you and Mr. Hu think.

I have proven before that the character "Yu" has the meaning of the character "Yi." (Within the Supplement to Examples of Doubtful Ancient Phrases) Then, in reverse, the character "Yi" can also have the meaning of the character "Yu." If one translates "Yu" as "What Place," and also translates "Yi" as "Yu," it would be too entangled. What do you say? I wish you health, Shuda

Mr. Qian Xuantong Sends to Hu Shi

Shi Zhi:

Yang Yufu wrote to me to discuss the issue of "Yu Yi." I think he has great insights. The sentence he cited, "Yu Yi Qiu Zhi, Yu Lin Zhi Xia," is very worthy of study. The character "Tai" in "Ru Tai," previous people seemed to all think that it was the transformation of the character "He," although it can be barely said, the sound (yun) seems to be still a bit off. ("Tai's" ancient sound is in the Ying Niu Hai Yun, and its value is approximately [blank space], "He's" ancient sound is in the Xia Niu [blank space] Yun, and its value is approximately [blank space].) If the character "Yi" has the meaning of "He," then the character "Tai" does not need to be [blank space] with the character "He." "Yi" was written in ancient times as [ancient character], and "Tai" was written as [ancient character], with Mu (eye) making the sound. The character "Si" is sometimes written as "Shi," all of which can be used as evidence that the two characters can be used interchangeably. But I do not know if Mr. Yang's proof still has heterodox meaning in it? What is your opinion? I hope you will enlighten me. Your younger brother Xuantong (1922, 10, 3)

More than twenty years ago, I began to study the empty words in the Book of Poetry. At that time, I pointed out that the sentences "Yu Yi Cai Pin, Yu Zhao Yu Zhi" (Where to gather artemisia? In the marsh and on the islet), "Yu Yi Yong Zhi, Gong Hou Zhi Shi" (Where to use it? In the service of lords and dukes), and other such sentences were all questions in the first sentence, and answers in the second sentence. Where to gather artemisia? In the marsh and on the islet. Where to use them? In the service of lords and dukes. This was agreed by a group of friends. But at that time, I especially paid attention to the many examples of the character "Yu" being used as an adverb, such as "Yu Fei" (Fly), which means "Fei Yan" (fly where), fly to what place. "Yu Gui" (Return), which means "Gui Yan" (return where), return to what place. Therefore, I initially argued that "Yu Yi" was a kind of inverted ancient grammar, the same as "Shi Yi" (therefore), "He Yi" (why), and "Suo Yi" (the reason). "Yu" is "what place," or "what," and "Yi" is an inverted preposition. This statement seems even more plausible in the "Shao Nan Cai Pin" chapter of the Book of Poetry, "Yu Yi Sheng Zhi? Wei Kuang Ji Ju. Yu Yi Xiang Zhi? Wei Qi Ji Fu." (Where to put them? In baskets and hampers. Where to offer them? In pots and pans). The grammar of these two places, "Yu Yi" and "He Yi," is very similar.

Later, Mr. Yang Yufu learned of this statement and wrote to Mr. Qian Xuantong, suggesting that the character "Yi" be interpreted as "He" (What), while the character "Yu" remains a preposition. This statement seems easier to understand than my original proposal, so Xuantong and I later accepted it. Hu Shi, 1948, 1, 23

### On the "Playing the Xiao for Funerals" Theory

— Xing Gongwan

Yu Zhengxie's "Gui Si Cun Gao" (Collected Manuscripts from the Year Gui Si) (part of the Zheyun Congshu Series), volume eleven, in the section "Playing the Xiao for Funerals," states:

The Records of the Grand Historian, Hereditary House of Zhou Bo, says: "First, he made a living by weaving thin mats, and often played the xiao for people's funerals." Ru Chun's Jiejie (Collected Explanations) says: "Entertaining guests at funerals with music, like actors." Chen Zan says: "Playing the xiao to entertain guests at funerals is like musicians." The Suoyin says: "The Zuo Commentary says 'singing at the bier,' like today's funeral dirges, the singers often hold the xiao and pipe." The annotation in the Book of Han, Biography of Bo, Shigu uses Chen Zan's explanation. Now, according to Suoyin, it is correct. The xiao is not a panpipe, but a vertical xiao, also called a bugle; referring to the reed of the xiao, blown to make sound; this was the funeral ritual of the Qin and Han dynasties, not for entertaining guests with music. The two meanings of "bugle" are: one is a short xiao. The Song Shu, Treatise on Music, says: "Bugles are short xiao and nao songs." Guo Maoqian's Yuefu Jieti says: "Bugles are short xiao and nao songs; , horizontal blowing, Qi Jiao and so on." The other is the name of music. The Book of Han, Biography of Han Yanshou, says: "Drum carts, bugle carts, and various imperial procession bugles," Chen Lin's proclamation says: "Ascending to high hills and beating drums and bugles." Zhao Sheng of the Song Dynasty's Chaoye Leiyao says: "Bugles are the Taichang music of the Ministry of Rites. Generally, refined music is played at the military gate and the front of the camp, without bells, chimes, xun, zhu, qin, or se, only drums, cymbals, nao, [blank character], flutes, and fifes." Funeral processions use short [blank character] to regulate movement; and to prevent the dead from causing harm, not for entertaining guests with music. Later, bells and jingles were used. The Jin Shu, Treatise on Five Elements, says: "During the time of the Duke of Haixi, Shou Xi sang funeral dirges, shaking a large bell." Also, during the Liang Dynasty, Xie Jiqing held a bell and sang funeral dirges. According to the Tang system, the funeral dirge singers wore sackcloth similar to those who wailed and took the place of mourners. In Li Wa's Biography in the Taiping Guangji: the second-rate vendors of funereal instruments were better able, and advanced holding bells, also to regulate movement. Summarizing Yu's opinions, he believed that

1. The short xiao is also called a bugle, and bugles have two meanings, one is short xiao and nao songs.

2. Funeral processions use short xiao to regulate their movement.

3. Funeral processions use short xiao to regulate their movement, and later, bells and jingles were used.

These are all errors from the wise despite a thousand considerations. According to Guo Maoqian's book, the lyrics of bugle songs contain eighteen Han nao songs, none of which are funeral dirges. And in the collection of Xianghe songs, there are thirty-two ancient songs, including "Hao Lu" and "Hao Li." The Tongzhi, Yue Lue, says: "Also called 'Heaven and Earth Funeral Songs,' also called 'Funeral Procession Songs.'" The Jin Shu, Treatise on Music, says: "All the existing ancient lyrics of music chapters are street songs and ballads from the Han Dynasty: 'South of the River Can Pick Lotuses,' 'The Island Bears Fifteen Children,' 'Ballad of White Hair,' and the like, which were later gradually adapted into orchestral music, which is the 'Xianghe' songs." The Song Shu, Treatise on Music: "'Xianghe' is an old Han song; strings and bamboo harmonize with each other, and the conductor sings." Therefore, funeral dirges emphasize singing, but in terms of their harmony, Zhou Bo's playing of the xiao was still related to the funeral dirge. The xiao played by Zhou Bo (and what Wu Zixu played when begging for food in the Wu market as recorded in the Records of the Grand Historian) may have been a short xiao, but it does not necessarily mean that it was a bugle. Yu's reason for interpreting the short xiao as a bugle is probably due to the idea that "funeral processions use short xiao to regulate movement" being entrenched in his mind. Because it "regulates movement," it uses the music played at the military gate and the front of the camp. But in fact, funeral dirges are used when "setting out the coffin," and funeral dirges are also used when performing the ritual of "ancestral sacrifices" at home, as the Song Shu (volume sixty-nine), Biography of Fan Hua, says:

Ye was promoted to the position of assistant minister of the Ministry of Personnel. In the winter of the first year of the Yuanjia era, the Pengcheng Prince's concubine died, and as she was about to be buried, on the night of the "ancestral sacrifice," colleagues and former subordinates all gathered at the Eastern Mansion. Hua's younger brother, Guangyuan, was then the libationer of the Ministry of Education and was on duty that day. Ye, along with Wang Shen, a subordinate of the Secretary of Education, and his younger brother Guangyuan, stayed up, drinking heavily in the middle of the night, opening the north window and listening to funeral dirges as entertainment. Pengcheng Yikang was furious and demoted Hua to the position of prefect of Xuancheng.

Moreover, in the Han Dynasty, wedding banquets also used funeral dirges to add to the fun, as Ying Shao's Fengsu Tong (cited in Yulan, volume 552) says

In the capital, at wedding banquets and festive gatherings, after the drinking reached its peak, funeral dirges were used as entertainment. This has nothing to do with regulating the movement of funeral carriages. Since funeral dirges emphasize singing, and the xiao player cannot sing at the same time, Yu Xi shaking the bell, Ji Qing holding the bell, and the singer in Li Wa's Biography advancing holding the bell, all involve singing on one side and shaking the bell on the other. Shaking the bell is to keep time for the song, not to regulate the movement of funeral carriages (the funeral dirge singer in Li Wa's Biography ascends the platform and sings, and there is no funeral carriage following). Therefore, the bell is not a substitute for the short xiao. Sima Zhen said: "The Zuo Commentary says 'singing at the bier' (this is in the eleventh year of Duke Ai. Du Yu's annotation: 'Singing at the bier is a song for sending off the funeral.') is like today's funeral dirges, the singers often hold the xiao and pipe." This indicates that in the Tang Dynasty, people still harmonized with funeral dirges with the xiao and pipe, which is what is meant by "strings and bamboo harmonize with each other," which is also what is meant by "playing the xiao for funerals"; and advancing holding the bell is what is meant by "the conductor sings." However, in later generations, it seems that there were very few who harmonized with the xiao and pipe, so in Li Wa's Biography, he only praised him for harmonizing with the funeral dirge singer. Furthermore, as the Book of Later Han (volume ten), Treatise on Rituals, says:

According to rituals, upon ascension... the Yu Lin orphans and Ba Yu selected sixty singers to form six rows, with eight bell directors holding bells.

These eight people were singers, and the sixty people were harmonizers. Zhuangzi, Da Zong Shi, says

Zi Sanghu, Meng Zifan, and Zi Qinzhang were friends... When Zi Sanghu died, before he was buried, Confucius heard of it and sent Zigong to attend to the funeral arrangements. Some arranged music, some played the qin, harmonizing and singing, saying: "Alas, Sanghu! Alas, Sanghu! He has reverted to his true state, and yet I still consider myself human."

Cheng Xuanying annotates "attending to" as "providing for the funeral arrangements"; and "arranging music" should also be the "weaving thin mats" mentioned in the Hereditary House of Zhou Bo. Cheng's annotation also says

"Alas" is the sound of the song. "Sanghu" and following is the harmonizing phrase. "Yi" is the harmonizing sound. Therefore, the ritual of funeral dirges existed before the Qin and Han Dynasties. The Tan Gong records that when Yuan Rang's mother died, he climbed a tree and sang. Also, when Zhuangzi's wife died, he also sang while knocking on a basin. These all have their background in customs. However, Confucianism, regarding funeral rites, emphasizes "grief in countenance and sorrow in weeping" (Mencius, Teng Wengong); therefore, the Book of Rites, Qu Li, says: "If there is a funeral in the neighborhood, do not sing in the alley," and the Analects also says: "When the Master ate beside someone mourning, he never ate his fill; when the Master cried on this day, he did not sing." (Huang Ben connects these two chapters) Therefore, the custom of funeral dirges is incompatible with the spirit of Confucianism, and it is not recorded in the classics. Confucianism, regarding contemporary customs, "transmitted but did not create," only rationalized them; and everything that did not conform to its spirit was rejected. In terms of funerals, killing animals to send off the dead (Youzi, Treatise on Rites), burning them, exposing them, dressing them in firewood and abandoning them in ditches (Liezi, Yang Zhu), were all rejected by Confucianism, and it had its choices and its theories. Judging from what is recorded in the Da Zong Shi, it should be a type of funeral dirge, and the Records of the Grand Historian's Zhou Bo playing the xiao and Zhuangzi's "some played the qin" refer to the harmonization of strings and bamboo; Yuan Rang's knocking on the tree and Zhuangzi's drumming on the basin are the holding of time. This custom, although not accepted by Confucianism, was rationalized by Daoism.

This custom was still popular during the Yuan and Ming dynasties, so the Water Margin (chapter twenty-three) records the proverb "The coffin has come out, ask for the funeral dirge singer's money." (The transcription of this was completed on the 28th of the ninth month of the thirty-sixth year.)

### The Sources of Material for *The Scholars*

— Ji Xianlin

Of all Chinese novels, apart from *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the one I like most is *The Scholars*. Usually, when I read miscellaneous books, I write down anything related to *The Scholars*. Now, looking at my notes, I have written quite a lot. Many of these items have been noticed by other scholars as well (see Lu Xun's *Xiaoshuo Jiuwen Chao*, Kong Lingjing's *Zhongguo Xiaoshuo Shiliao*, and Jiang Ruizao's *Xiaoshuo Kaozheng*). But there are still a few items that no scholar has noticed before, and in my opinion, these items can give us more insight into the question of the sources of material for *The Scholars*, so I will transcribe them below and discuss them.

You Tong's *Genqi Zaji* says

When Yuan Yian was the prefect, he spent his days enjoying himself with Weiqi and singing operas. The chief official satirized him, saying: "I heard that in your office, all one hears all day is the sound of Weiqi pieces, the sound of flutes, and the sound of operas, is that so?" Yuan said: "Yes, I hear them. In Your Honor's office, there are also three sounds all day." The chief official asked what sounds. Yuan said: "They are the sound of the abacus, the sound of the steelyard, and the sound of the board." The chief official was greatly angered and impeached him, causing him to lose his position.

Chu Renhuo's *Jianhu Ji Shiji*, volume one, also records the same story:

It was also heard that when Mr. (Yuan Yian) was in Wuchang, a certain circuit intendant said: "I heard there are two sounds in Your Honor's office: the sound of the singing boy and the sound of the opera." Mr. replied: "Your Lordship also has two sounds: the sound of the steelyard and the sound of the bamboo cane." The intendant remained silent, and before long Mr. hung up the impeachment memorial.

Both of these notes are about Yuan Yian, and are probably based on facts. The eighth chapter of *The Scholars* also has a similar story:

The former judicial commissioner Xiang said: "I heard there are three kinds of sounds coming from inside Prefect Guan's gate." Wang Shoudao said: "What three kinds?" [the] son said: "The sound of reciting poetry, the sound of singing, and the sound of opera." Prefect Wang smiled and said: "That's exactly what Zhao is thinking." [the] son said: "When the old gentleman shows his true colors, I'm afraid the sounds will change." Prefect Wang said: "What sounds?" The son said: "The sound of the battle-staff, the sound of the abacus, and the sound of the board."

There are two possibilities here: Prefect Wang Shoudao either alludes to Yuan Yian, or alludes to another person, and Wu Jingzi borrowed Yuan Yian's story and applied it to him.

Yuan Mei's *Suiyuan Shihua*, volume four, says

There have been many talented women in the past who could write poetry, why are there so few now? When I was the magistrate of Jiangning, there were two women from Songjiang named Zhang, living in a nunnery, who claimed to be related to Wen Min Gong. The elder sister's name was Wanyu, married into the Cheng family in Huaibei, but she did not get along with her husband and privately escaped. The magistrate of Shanyang sent a document to have them apprehended. When I released them, Wanyu presented a poem in the hall, saying: "In the depths of the lake, there are fragrant-sounding flowers, mistakenly entered the house of a Huaixi merchant, met the Bai Sima of Jiangzhou, dared to tell her grievances to the Pipa." I suspected that it was written by someone else, so the woman asked for a face-to-face test. I used the dry tree in the courtyard as the topic. The woman said: "Since Your Honor has allowed this handmaiden to write poetry, poets do not kneel. May I have paper and brush to write a poem while standing?" I allowed it. She leaned against a chair and wrote quickly, saying: "Standing alone in the empty courtyard for a long time, facing the sun every morning. Who can plant it, and move it to the backyard to be fragrant?" Before long, Magistrate Feng of Shanyang came, and I asked what to do with the Zhang women, saying: "This matter should not be decided by divorce; however, a talented woman marrying a vulgar merchant is not fitting. Therefore, release her from the crime of escaping, and let her return home." I asked how he knew she was talented. He said: "She presented a poem, saying: 'Weeping, I tell the gods and magistrates, please allow me to return to my homeland. In the future, I will transform into a Sichuan crow and bring blessings to your side.'" Feng was originally from Sichuan.

Isn't this exactly the female poet Shen Qiongzi written in chapters 40 and 41 of *The Scholars*?

Duan Chengshi's *Youyang Zazu*, volume one, says

At the end of the Tianbao era, Jiaozhi [tribute] dragon brain, shaped like silkworm. Persians said old dragon brains came from the tree joints. [Blank] was called the Dragon's Brain of Luck by the Forbidden City. The emperor only bestowed ten pieces on Lady Yang. The fragrance permeates more than ten paces. One summer day the Emperor and the imperial prince came to [blank] one evening to have He Huaizhi play the Pipa alone. Lady Yang would stand in front of the board and watch. The Emperor was about to lose several stones when Lady Yang put the Persian puppy on the Emperor's side. The puppy got on the board and messed up all the stones and the Emperor was very happy. At that time the wind blew Lady Yang's neckerchief on to He Huaizhi's hair band and after a long time it came off. When He Huaizhi returned he was unusually conscious of the fragrance and put it inside a silken sack. When the Emperor regained the palace he missed Yang very much and He offered up the band, recounting events of the day. The Emperor opened the bag and wept saying: "This is the luckiest fragrance".

The fifty-third chapter of *The Scholars* also has a similar story:

Chen Muna was about to lose again. Lady Ping held the black-and-white cat.

[The Cat] leapt over. The chess pieces were ruined. The story is exactly the same as Yang's. I don't believe that this is a co-incidence but that Wu had intentionally borrowed it.

The above are three examples. From just these three examples, I think that we should revise our previous understanding of the sources of material for *The Scholars*. People generally believe that the characters in *The Scholars* are mostly real people. Jin He's postscript in Shangyuan opened a list. Since then, others have made similar speculations. I do not deny that many of the characters in the book are allusions to real people; but if one says that since the people are real, the events should also be real, then there is a problem. The story of Zhang Tiebi is completely copied from *Guiyuan Congtan*, which other scholars have already pointed out. In the third example above, we pointed out that Lady Ping's story was copied from Yang's story. These are just two examples, but in fact, there are definitely more than just these two places where *The Scholars* borrows from previous notes or novels. From this we can see that Wu Jingzi is not simply trying to write biographies for these people in *The Scholars*, he is writing a novel, like other novelists. In previous novels or notes, as long as he saw useful material, he collected it and [blank] it into his own book. If readers truly believe that everything written in this book is about real people and real events, and listen to Jin He's words and search through [blank] Qian's collected essays, then it will be in vain.

### Commonplace

— Nian Hong

During wartime, a plane unfortunately crashed in the northwest. After fifty-two hours, an air force headquarters reconnaissance plane discovered the wreckage. Immediately, personnel were dispatched to land and search for the pilot's whereabouts. In this vast expanse of desert, the pilot's body was found about two *li* away from the plane, with two bags of dried rations beside him. However, the veins in his wrist were bitten through, and his mouth and tongue were covered in bloodstains. It turned out that because he could not get a drop of water for three days, even though he was fortunate not to have died when the plane crashed, he eventually bit through his own veins in his desperate thirst, hoping to drink a mouthful of blood to moisten his throat. The pain of thirst without water is imaginable.

In the mid-18th century, when British power was actively expanding in India, the Indian Governor-General of Bengal imprisoned one hundred and forty-six British people in a small room, no more than a *fangzhang* (approximately ten square feet) in size. This room had only two small window openings. After one night, when the British government negotiated for their release, only twenty-three people near the small window openings came out alive. The remaining one hundred and twenty-three people all suffocated to death. The expressions of pain on their faces were beyond description. This is the famous "Black Hole of Calcutta" in history.

Legend has it that in ancient times, there was a cruel chieftain in Africa who imprisoned his prisoners, providing them with food, drink, clothing, and shelter, but forbidding them from sleeping. He tried various methods to prevent the prisoners from closing their eyes. After two days, the prisoners became extremely exhausted. Even under the lash of whips, they still fell soundly asleep. Finally, in less than four days, these poor people died under this particularly cruel form of torture. At the time of death, their two eyes bulged out, filled with bloodshot veins, and their entire bodies' blood turned black, resembling a *yaksha* ghost.

Water, air, and sleep are all the most common and ordinary things. We who live by the sea never suffer from a lack of water. You can breathe in and out as much as you want, and the air is inexhaustible. Eight hours of sufficient sleep every night also seem to make us unaware of the suffering of lacking sleep. However, the more commonplace and ordinary things in the world are, the more important and indispensable they are. As the saying goes, "Only when you are sick do you realize the true value of health, and only those on the verge of death understand the loveliness of life." Today, everything is expensive. If water and air also had to be bought with money, there would certainly be no shortage of people hoarding water and air, and it can be guaranteed that it would be easier to get rich than hoarding rice and firewood. Unfortunately, fate plays tricks on people. If food were like the water of the Huangpu River, wouldn't the disputes in the world be greatly reduced?

Humans are born to enjoy freedom from want. The Creator has given us water, air, and time, which we can take and use as we please. But we still need one indispensable thing – bread. This requires the cooperation of all mankind so that everyone can avoid deprivation.

### Truman's Secretary

— Mao Yi

Fifty years ago, Charles Griffith Ross and Harry Truman attended the same school in Independence, Missouri. Only a few desks separated them. Today, they both work together in the President's Office of the United States, separated by only two doors. Their lives were closely linked together in their youth, and they understood each other deeply. However, when people asked Ross how he and Truman addressed each other, he replied apologetically, "I call him Mr. President, but he only calls me Charlie."

Ross's office has a thick oriental carpet, a black stove, bean-green walls, and photos of his two children hanging on them. In addition, there is a large photo of his predecessor, Steve Early, and two photos of Truman. From his window, there is a view of a lawn, pleasing to the eye. The overall style of the room is calm and peaceful, which matches Ross's personality.

His blue eyes are gentle, but not docile. He is thin and a little stooped. His chin is slightly prominent, and his nose is quite large. His personality is mostly expressed in his chin, although his eyes also express part of it. If necessary, he can be tenacious, but he can also be gentle. This is all expressed in his eyes.

Ross was originally a journalist. In 1931, he wrote an article criticizing the administration of then-US President Hoover, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. Before entering the White House in 1945, he was a senior editor at the *St. Louis Post-Dispatch* and a prominent figure in the American press. He originally had no intention of going to the White House. This change of job meant leaving his beloved work and a decrease in income – the newspaper's annual salary was $35,000, while Truman only paid him $10,000.

President Truman firmly invited him to serve as his new secretary, but Joseph Pulitzer, the owner of the *Post-Dispatch*, did not want to let him go. Truman was forced to call him, saying that the invitation was an order issued in his position as President. Later, the *Post-Dispatch* reported on the front page: "Truman Kidnaps Ross."

The strength that Ross could provide for Truman was obvious. He had one of the most intelligent political minds in Washington, and he also had the special ability to accurately predict reactions. He gave Truman a broad understanding of many people. At his almost daily press conferences, he solved many problems for his master.

Ross arrived at the office every morning at 8:30, visited the President an hour later, and then handled the day's affairs. His most important task was to speak on behalf of the President at press conferences. Ross had worked in the news industry for forty years, and he knew the habits of journalists well. Therefore, he knew how to cater and how to avoid, and his answers were appropriate.

Before entering the White House, Ross had spared no effort in praising Truman's promotion to President. In April 1945, he wrote in the *Post-Dispatch*: "People call Truman an ordinary American, but he is actually stronger than ordinary people. He is not an insignificant person. He may not become a great president, but he will definitely become a good president."

Fifty years ago, from Independence to Washington, Ross and Truman have always been friends sharing the same boat. Americans say that the two of them are the "No. 1 Team" in the United States.

Mr. Chu Anping, editor of the *Observer Weekly*, said in his article "We Suggest the Government Investigate and Announce the White Paper Rationing Situation": "As far as this magazine is concerned, when we started publication in September 1946, the price of paper was only 25,000 yuan per ream, but now it has risen to about 1.5 million yuan, an increase of about 60 times. However, our selling price when we started publication was only 500 yuan per copy. Even with the current selling price of 7,000 yuan per copy, the selling price of this magazine has only increased 14 times. This is a definite fact that the price of paper has increased 60 times in the same period, while the selling price has only increased 14 times, and the contrast is so strong that people cannot help but feel shaken after seeing it. Unless the sales or selling price of newspapers, books, or magazines can increase proportionally to the price of white paper, they will eventually be drained of blood and sweat and collapse."

The facts cited by Mr. Chu are all facts, but it is not very reasonable to argue that the selling price of newspapers, books, and magazines should increase proportionally to the price of white paper, that is, if the price of white paper has increased 60 times since September 1946, then the price of newspapers, books, and magazines should also increase 60 times. Because we know that white paper is only one component in the making of a newspaper, book, or magazine. In addition, there are manuscript fees, typesetting costs, etc., all of which are indispensable. Unless the expenses of a newspaper, book, or magazine increase proportionally to the price of white paper, it is quite unreasonable to increase its selling price solely according to the price of white paper, which has increased the most. This is definitely not what our cultural circles should do or say.

Logically speaking, manuscripts are the most important raw material for books and periodicals. Readers spend money to buy books and magazines to read articles, not to look at white paper. Therefore, the value of articles should be above white paper. This was indeed the case before the war. Some magazines—such as *Life* and *China Youth Weekly*—paid manuscript fees of more than ten yuan per thousand words, which meant that the value of a writer's thousand words could buy two or three to four or five reams of white paper. Normally, it was three to five yuan per thousand words, which was also the price of one ream of paper. But what about now? White paper is one of the items whose price has risen the most crazily since the war, and the painstaking efforts of writers are afraid that it is difficult to compare. But considering manuscript fees together with typesetting costs is always fair and reasonable, not a writer's wishful thinking, right? What is the reality? I know that before the war, typesetting costs were only five or six cents per thousand words, and the most common manuscript fee was three yuan per thousand words, which was about six times the typesetting cost. Now, typesetting costs are more than 80,000 yuan per thousand words (I don't know if it has increased recently), but which bookstore, magazine, or newspaper generally pays 400,000 to 500,000 yuan per thousand words for manuscripts? I know that currently, most manuscript fees are lower than typesetting costs, and there are few that are higher than typesetting costs. It is rare to pay manuscript fees that are twice as high as typesetting costs, "from beginning to end." That is to say, typesetting costs have increased about 40,000 to 50,000 times compared to before the war, while manuscript fees have generally increased only 30,000 to 40,000 times.

So, how many times has the selling price of magazines increased compared to before the war? In fact, it has generally increased 140,000 to 150,000 times, which is exactly the same as the price of typesetting. It is less than white paper (about 300,000 times if 1.5 million is used) but more than manuscript fees. That is to say, writers have a hard life and have to pay for white paper with their hard work.

However, the fate of writers is determined by publishers. If publishers do not intend to despise writers, manuscript fees can at least be increased in proportion to typesetting costs. Of course, in this way, the selling price may have to be increased, and the burden on readers will increase. However, readers should increase this burden, because if they have to increase the burden due to the increase in the price of white paper and typesetting costs, they have an even more unshirkable duty to increase the burden due to the increase in manuscript fees—they originally spent money to read articles.

The current plight of authors with ridiculously low manuscript fees is, to be honest, entirely because publishers simply do not have authors in mind. The best evidence is that every time they increase the selling price, they always say, "This magazine has to increase its price from this issue due to the soaring price of paper (or the sudden increase in printing costs)." They have never said, "This magazine has increased its selling price from this issue because manuscript fees have increased from the previous issue." It seems that articles are simply an insignificant thing for magazines, and authors are either immortals who do not eat earthly food or wealthy people with billions of assets.

But even if the authors are immortals or wealthy people, publishers should do their best to reasonably increase manuscript fees. If the immortals or wealthy people do not want them, they can donate them to refugees. What's more, most authors themselves are refugees.

The current manuscript fees are so ridiculously low that I dare not say that publishers are exploiting authors, but it is undeniable that they are bullying authors—if authors had a trade association like the printing industry and said that they wanted a certain number of yuan per thousand words, otherwise they would not write, I think publishers would only have the "yes, yes" method, right?

Jie Zitui did not speak of emoluments, and emoluments did not come to him. Scholars are ashamed to argue for manuscript fees, and it is not surprising that manuscript fees do not increase because of this. But from now on, the sounds of culture, culture, what, what will be no different from officials taking office for the sake of the country and the people.

A three-year-old child, Jamie, fell into a well near his home. There was very little hope of saving him and preserving his life. The wellhead was only two feet in diameter, and below four feet, the diameter of the circle shrunk to fourteen inches. The surrounding area was sandy soil, and if stirred, it would collapse into a hole. Below twenty-two feet, the wellhead diameter shrank again, leaving only eight inches: only as thick as a bacon pipe. The child had fallen into the narrowest part of the well.

His father shone a flashlight down and only saw the child's head. He wanted to throw a rope down and pull him up, but he was not successful; the child was too young and did not have the strength to hold the rope firmly. He was gradually suffocating to death.

The well was too narrow, and ordinary adults could not go deep after climbing a few feet. It was also inconvenient to dig the well casing, as the sandy soil was too loose. Once it collapsed, it would be like burying the child alive.

A seventeen-year-old youth, Li Liciman, volunteered to go down the well to save the child. He admitted that he was small and could fit into the narrow well casing. He held the child in his arms, with a rope tied around his waist in advance, waiting for the people on the ground to pull him up. Liciman went down for the first time (head first, upside down), and at a depth of fifteen feet, his shoulders and hips were already tightly against the well wall. Light was cut off, he could not see the child at the bottom of the well, and he felt dizzy. Due to the lack of air, he almost suffocated to death. The people on the ground reluctantly pulled him out.

Two minutes later, he tried again. This time, he reached a depth of eighteen feet. He supported himself with his hands, twisting his body, trying to go a few feet further to reach a point where he could grab the child's hand. But before he could get close to the child, he fainted and was lifted up again. On the third attempt, he grabbed the child's wrist. The people waiting above slowly pulled up the rope, and Liciman and the child escaped the cage of the well casing. Liciman felt dizzy, had a headache, and his skin was scraped, but he recovered his strength after a few hours.

This spirit of courageous action immediately received a reward. The Carnegie Hero Fund Commission awarded him a silver medal and $500 in cash. Before awarding the prize, the Carnegie investigator had to investigate the depth and diameter of the well and had to have a report signed and sealed by the rescuers. If they had any doubts about the facts, the investigator had to re-enact the performance of rescuing people from the well, throwing a model child to the bottom of the well and personally going into the well head-down to try it out.

A canoe capsized in Halifax Harbor. At that time, Mrs. McCabe, who was recovering from a recent illness and was still very weak, was standing on the shore, witnessing the tragedy at the prime age of thirty-six. Two teenagers in the canoe were struggling in the water. Mrs. McCabe disregarded everything and waded into the water, swimming close to them. One teenager had already sunk and was unconscious. She dived into the water and grabbed the teenager. At that time, a child on a boat in the harbor also heard the alarm and came to rescue. McCabe dragged him close to the small boat and bravely pushed the unconscious teenager onto the boat. Then she went to rescue another teenager and also pushed him onto the rescue boat. Her arms were numb, and she was exhausted, but she automatically climbed onto the small boat and helped the child carry the two almost drowned teenagers to the shore. The two teenagers were fortunate to be reborn, while she, with her weak body, suffered from the cold and dampness and had to recuperate for a long time before recovering.

The Fund commended Mrs. McCabe's bravery, awarding her a bronze medal and $500 in cash. She could use it to buy some furniture that she urgently wanted to purchase.

The English novelist Thackeray said, "Bravery never goes out of style." This is why the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission considers it their unshirkable duty to commend those who act bravely.

### A Flicker That Does Not Extinguish

— He Ku

*Crown Magazine* has a column that is often seen but not noticed, called "New Interpretations of Words," which uses a different perspective to interpret a word. For example, for "sofa," their interpretation is: "A chair that is hard to find empty and not sit on." The interpretation of golf is "A game of hitting a small ball into a gap in a big ball that is billions of times bigger than it." This kind of new interpretation, in addition to being particularly insightful, contains elements of wit, sarcasm, and cold laughter—but it seems vulgar as soon as it is said.

I don't know if it was George Bernard Shaw who said that Chinese people do not understand humor (including wit, sarcasm, and cold laughter) very much. I don't remember clearly, but in short, I have heard such a criticism. In fact, if you pay attention, Chinese people really understand the way of wit, sarcasm, and cold laughter. Perhaps our wonderful articles cannot be widely published, and few people are willing to translate them enthusiastically, so that these wonderful texts can spread to the West. Therefore, foreigners believe that Chinese people do not understand humor. Still, look, Chinese people like to look at the author's signature first when reading an article. If it is Lao She or Lao Xiang, that's good, it must be a humorous article, and it must be "words with a meaning within the meaning." Little do they know that Lao She and Lao Xiang also use other pen names to write. Because the signature is not familiar, they look at it and leave. It is also one of the reasons why good articles are placed in front of them but not read and are unknown.

Recently, we saw an example of "New Interpretations of Words"-style humor in action in our city's case of a certain lawyer suing the post office in court for a debt that was too small to be smaller. The reason I don't mention the name of the certain lawyer is not to publicize him, so as to prevent others from associating it with the lawyer's desire to show off, etc. I think this kind of lawsuit, in the eyes of people who study law, is a completely correct action, although the court has already ruled that the certain lawyer lost the case. The loss of this case was inevitable, because the Legislative Yuan had already disputed this matter with the Executive Yuan, and as a result, the postal rate increase passed by the State Council could be implemented without a legislative procedure. Therefore, the failure of the certain lawyer's lawsuit was inevitable. We are not talking about governance, regardless of success or failure. Looking at the actions of the certain lawyer alone, it is simply lovely humor, doing "New Interpretations of Words"-style work on violations of the situation on the *Crown Magazine*! Zhuangzi said: The sun and moon come out, but the flicker does not extinguish. In terms of its prosperity, is it not difficult? Something that ordinary people disdain to do and are unwilling to do is actually done by someone "willing to play a play with a stone mortar on their head," just like the flicker that does not extinguish, bursting out a lively spark in this world that lacks vivid interest.

### Method for Cultivating the Mind

— Wang Baili

Reading *Tea Leisure Talks* by Ruan Wushan, there is a passage on the method of cultivating the mind that says: "Duke Zhang Wenduan of Tongcheng once said: I have obtained a method in the past five or six years, allowing my body's five senses and hundreds of bones to go through worries, joys, troubles, and hardships. I only guard the square-inch land of my spiritual palace, building it into a city, firmly closing the four gates, not allowing any thoughts of worries, joys, honor, disgrace, advance, retreat, rise, fall, hardship, life, death, gain, or loss to sneak into it. If there is a slight gap, and it enters for a moment, I immediately drive it away, and continue to firmly guard it. As for external sounds and appearances, I only allow them to drift with the waves and belong to the clouds, floating and sinking with worries and joys." This so-called firmly guarding the four gates is the meaning of Mencius's "unmoved mind," which is known to be difficult. According to my notes in *Old Learning Hermitage Notes*, there is also a similar record that says: "My maternal uncle, Zhongjun, was eighty-five or six years old and extremely healthy. He said that he had an epiphany when he was young from reading the *Thousand Character Classic*, namely the four words 'mind moves, spirit tires.' Throughout his life, he never moved his mind when encountering things, so he did not decline in old age." Therefore, Duke Zhang Wenduan's method of cultivating the mind may have originated from the four words "mind moves, spirit tires."

### "Time is Money"

In Chicago, a stockbroker, fell in love with an illiterate young woman. During a hunting trip, the broker proposed to the woman. The broker made special arrangements to send her to school to study, but when the woman had received a considerable education and had learned some social etiquette, the broker changed his mind. The young woman sued him for breach of promise.

"Her lawyer sent a letter requesting a sum of money to compensate for the loss. Paying is okay—but there is one item among them," he complained, "that seems excessive."

"What is this item?" asked a sympathetic friend.

The broker said dejectedly, "She is asking for compensation for the loss of time spent studying to improve her mind—$3,000." (Lei)

### Zhu Zhifeng

— Zheng Guoyi

At the end of the [Ming Dynasty], Li Zicheng, a military commander, killed Zhou Ji, the grand coordinator. Subsequently, he attacked Xuanfu, and among those who died for their country was the governor, Zhu Zhifeng. Zhou Xinfang's play, "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," also incorporates the story of Zhu Zhifeng. There is a biography of Zhifeng in the History of Ming, which differs slightly from Zhou Xinfang's version. Xinfang elaborates that he died by slitting his throat, while the History of Ming states that he actually died by hanging himself. Dramatic performances and historical facts do not necessarily have to be completely consistent. The important thing is that Zhu Zhifeng's loyalty and integrity are propagated through the drama, and his virtues are fully expressed. There is no need to quibble over the actual facts. However, the meaning of the name "Zhifeng" is quite puzzling. In Xinfang's play, the character "Feng" is read as "Ping," presumably because he could not find a suitable explanation and simply pronounced it as the "Feng" in "rushing at a tiger without weapons and crossing a river without a boat." However, when I read the biography of Zhu Zhifeng by Governor Wang Zhufu (Yan), it states: "Zhu Zhifeng, whose courtesy name was Dezhi, was a Jinshi in the fifth year of the Tianqi reign. In the early years of the Chongzhen reign, the roving bandits plundered everywhere. The Governor's wife, Madam Feng, died cursing the bandits. The Governor memorialized the Emperor, saying: 'A wife serving her husband is like a subject serving his sovereign. My wife does not betray me, how dare I betray my country? I wish to serve my country as my wife serves our family. I request to change my name to Zhifeng.' It is said that the Governor's original name was Zhiyuan." From this, not only can we correct the mistake of reading "Feng" as "Ping," but we can also understand that the name "Zhifeng" originated from "being grateful for his virtuous wife and changing his name to express his devotion." Therefore, I dare to discuss it here, hoping that those who appreciate drama will understand its origin.

Fengsheng said, "I am not afraid, it doesn't matter." Yunqing said, "Don't be too careless. I think it's better for you to talk to Qihuan, tell her you have the right to cancel the divorce agreement, and declare that you can bind her. Even if she comes to your house in the future, she cannot be treated as the legal wife. It's most reasonable for someone of your status to say these words." Fengqing shook her head and said, "It's meaningless. Stolen sesame cakes don't taste good. I won't do that. Besides, it's beneath my dignity to negotiate with an actress, and it's not worth the effort. I won't do it. I don't think Zhuzhai would do such a foolish thing either." Yunqing was very disappointed that she couldn't persuade Fengsheng. After a while, she said again, "You can call Zhuzhai over and ask him if this is true." Fengsheng said, "Why should I ask him? Would he tell me? I'll just see what happens!" Yunxiang saw that she firmly refused and knew it was useless to say more, so she said, "I'm just telling you not to be careless about this. If he succeeds, it will be difficult for you to deal with." Fengsheng said, "I'm not afraid. Anyway, I'm going all out, I'm not afraid of anything. Even if Zhuqi is willing to come back, I don't think it's useful. In short, my relationship with him is not good. What's the point of living together!" Yunqing saw that she was so resolute, so she said, "I came specifically to tell you this news today. If you think you have it under control, I don't need to worry about you!" Fengsheng said, "Thank you. As long as he doesn't short me on my monthly living expenses, I won't trouble him." Yunqing said, "Maybe the thirty million yuan he gave you this time was allocated from Qihuan's hand." Fengsheng said, "I don't care about that. As long as it's given to me by him, it's his money, and I have no responsibility for how I spend it." Yunqing saw that she was so nonchalant and knew that she couldn't be utilized. After chatting for a while, she went home. When she got home, she thought about this matter carefully and felt that if Zhuzhai continued to meddle, by the time the matter was a foregone conclusion, there would be no way to solve it. Even if Zhuzhai's family opposed it, it would only cause a family conflict. It might even incite Zhuzhai to take Qihuan to the south. Zhuzhai often said that he had no prospects in Beiping and had long intended to go south. If this really prompted him to go south, it would be fulfilling their wishes. The only regret was that in a moment of excitement, she had pushed Fengsheng and Zhuzhai to divorce, never expecting such a big mistake. Yunqing had the most meticulous mind and was usually the most strategic, but today, no matter how much she thought, she couldn't come up with a clever solution, which made her restless and unable to eat. Old Mrs. Zhang saw this and knew that she was upset about Zhuzhai's matter. She wanted to tell Zhuzhai's father, Xu Yuru, several times, but Yunqing strongly stopped her, saying that even if Yuru knew, it would only create more family entanglements. If the two of them were still determined, they would eventually get together.
