[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Ministry of Industry and Commerce reports: In order to control exports and fairly allocate export quotas, the United States has sent a letter requesting our country to submit the required quantities of various materials to be purchased from the United States from July of this year to June of next year.

Except for building materials and miscellaneous items (including items such as wax and empty cans for milk), which are not currently needed, all other items meet our country's needs. The required quantity forms have been compiled into a summary table by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce based on the data submitted by various government agencies and private manufacturers, and the Commercial Counselor stationed in the United States has been instructed to negotiate with the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This summary table is only for the U.S. to refer to when determining national quotas.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Li Gan, Counselor of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated when meeting with reporters on the afternoon of the 15th that although the U.S. aid of $400 million is far from meeting our country's needs, if used properly, it will still be of great help to our country's current unstable economic situation. Li went to the United States in December of last year due to matters related to U.S. economic aid to China, and has now returned to the country to report to the authorities on various issues related to aid to China. He is en route through Tokyo, and will return to the United States to continue his mission after returning to the country. Li revealed that of the $400 million in aid to China, $60 million has been temporarily earmarked for construction expenses. A detailed plan is being prepared to allow our country to use the aid funds to purchase goods from foreign countries and sell them to private industrial businesses. The profits obtained will be placed in a special account. A portion of the deposits in the special account can also be used for construction, but most of it should be frozen in order to absorb the legal tender circulating in the market and curb inflation in our country.

### Legislative Yuan Passes the Organization Law of the Examination Department; Examination Law to Be Read for the Third Time in the Next Session; Two Proposals, Including the Organization of a慰問團慰問團慰問團Consolation Delegation, Have Been Rejected

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The 20th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 16th. President Sun Ke convened the meeting at 9:30 AM. After passing the minutes of the previous meeting, the meeting proceeded according to the agenda to discuss matters and handle cases as follows: (1) The proposal from the 21-member committee to draft the organizational regulations for the Legislative Yuan's war zone military and civilian慰問團慰問團慰問團consolation delegation for public decision was rejected by a majority of committee members, who believed that the motion was originally proposed for the Central Plains war and the time limit has passed. Moreover, the government has been actively promoting post-war relief work in the Central Plains, and there is no need for the Legislative Yuan to form another war zone慰問團慰問團慰問團consolation delegation. After half an hour of debate, the proposal was finally rejected with 249 votes against (out of 358 committee members present). (2) The proposal by Wang Zhaorong and others to request the Executive Yuan to telegraph the Shanghai Municipal Government to immediately release the students arrested on June 6 in order to maintain human rights was opposed by many people, including Lu Jingshi, who believed that the Legislative Yuan should not force the Executive Yuan to not punish spies and professional students under the guise of protecting human rights, which would undermine the Legislative Yuan's stance on suppressing rebellion and implementing the constitution. As a result of the vote, the proposal was also rejected with 270 votes against (out of 369 committee members present). (3) The Legislative Committee reported on the draft organizational law of the Examination Department. After Zhang Jinjian, convener of the Legislative Committee, explained the review process, the second reading was carried out item by item after brief discussion, and with the consent of the attendees, the third reading procedure was omitted, and the draft was passed without objection. (4) The Legislative Committee reported on the review and amendment of the draft Examination Law. After Liu Minghou, convener of the Legislative Committee, explained the review process, the meeting was adjourned due to the late hour. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon and began the second reading of the draft Examination Law, discussing it item by item. The committee members debated fiercely on the point in the draft that stipulated that the old examinations for provincial and district civil servants should be held in each province and district, and that candidates should be limited to their place of origin. In the end, the original proposal was maintained, and the provision that civil servants who passed the examination may be trained if necessary was deleted. In addition, there were only textual amendments. The second reading was completed at 7:00 PM in the afternoon, and it was decided that the third reading would be carried out at the next Yuan meeting before adjourning. The other cases listed on the agenda were not discussed and will be continued at the 21st meeting on the 17th.

### Few People and Many Affairs in the Legislative Yuan

Committees and Staff Work Late into the Night

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] A spokesman for the Legislative Yuan said: "Recently, despite the scorching heat, the legislators, the Budget Committee, and the staff of relevant units have been working late into the night, and they have no time to take care of the usual Sunday holiday. Especially at the beginning of the implementation of the constitution, various laws, regulations, and rules need to be reviewed, formulated, and sorted out by the Legislative Yuan. Judging from the number of staff and the work situation of the various units of the Yuan, there is a general feeling of 'few people and many affairs'. However, due to quota restrictions, transferees from various parties have not been able to be accommodated as much as possible. Recently, some people have advocated reducing the number of staff in order to save expenses, and the intention is good, but according to the actual needs, not only should it not be reduced, but it should also be appropriately increased in order to accelerate work efficiency and reduce the overwork of the existing staff."

Others believed that the case could first be handed over to the foreign affairs authorities for thorough investigation and research. If the government has indeed failed to conclude a treaty of peace with Japan after a long time, the General Assembly will decide to submit an impeachment case or a correction case. After voting, the latter was rejected, and it was decided to submit a report for discussion at the General Assembly on the 17th.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] A Nanjing newspaper reported a message saying: "In the future, in the peace conference with Japan, our country may, when necessary, give up its veto power, which has been confirmed by officials. However, the abandonment of the veto power is conditional, that is, our government believes that certain issues can be resolved through prior consultation." When reporters inquired with the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the answer was: This news is absolutely untrue. Our country's attitude towards the peace conference with Japan has been clearly declared by Vice Minister Ye Gongchao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in his statement to the Central News Agency on the 4th. The last sentence also emphasized: "Our government still maintains its consistent position, so that China can maintain its special position in the peace conference. Only in this way can we hope to realize a treaty that we believe can guarantee China's interests and world peace." He believed that in any occasion, Minister Wang or any official would not have considered or even confirmed the content of the newspaper's report. Reporters believe that after Ye Gongchao's statement, the Chinese government may not easily make efforts to promote the convening of the peace conference, because in such a world situation, this move is neither necessary nor possible.

[United Press, Beiping, 15th] Chu Xichun, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, told reporters from the United Press on the 15th that North China is the main fortress of democracy against communism. If this industrial and agricultural area falls, not only China but the whole world will suffer a serious blow. North China urgently needs economic assistance, which can be obtained from the US aid to China plan, but in fact, North China has been in a passive position, and it is often heard that 90% of US aid will be given to South China. North China needs assistance more than other places because North China is the key to the future of the Central Plains and South China. He also said: We do not need military assistance, what we need is economic assistance. We believe that the United States should assist Europe, but the communist threat there is not as serious as in North China. If China and its manpower and resources are controlled by the Communists, it will have a serious impact on the whole world. He has drafted a plan and presented it to the government to dig 300 wells and other agricultural improvements, but this does not need to be assisted by the United States, it can be paid for by selling the surplus materials purchased from the United States. We hope that the United States relief fund can be used for construction projects that are beneficial to the people and improve the people's living standards. He regretted that Stillman did not come to Beiping when he came to North China.

Editorial

### Power Politics and the Korean Tragedy

The tragedy of Korea is destined; the division of Korea is unavoidable. This is a major crisis in the Far East, a major upheaval in the Yellow Sea era. The arrival of this crisis and the rise and fall of the waves will be triggered by the division of Korea into North and South. According to recent news from Seoul, the Korean National Assembly formally passed the draft constitution on the 12th of this month and decided to start organizing a democratic government from the 14th. The United Nations will hold a general assembly in September and will take action based on the report of the delegation supervising the Korean elections. On the 11th, North Korea also announced that its constitution had come into effect and set the 25th of next month for a general election to establish its so-called North Korean People's Government. At the same time, Moscow and North Korean radio stations are fiercely criticizing South Korea and the United States; Seoul Radio is also scolding North Korea. The situation shows that the division of Korea into North and South has become an inevitable situation; the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea has moved from the Cold War to the brink of war. The evolution and development of this situation will have a significant impact on the Far East and China and is worthy of attention.

Korea, also known as Joseon, is one of the areas with the most disputes and conflicts after the war. We have pointed out that the creation of these disputes and conflicts is due to the secret diplomacy of the Cairo Conference, the Potsdam Conference, and the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, which have made a big mistake, no less than arranging a tragedy for the future of Korea. Although the Cairo Conference in October 1943 provided a guarantee for the independence and freedom of Korea initiated by China, it is a pity that "the decision to make Korea free and independent in due course" is because "independence" and "freedom" have temporal restrictions and cannot be granted within a certain period of time, so this guarantee is no less than half a failure. In particular, it was ridiculously wrong for the Potsdam Conference to decide to divide Korea along the 38th parallel north latitude, with the US and Soviet troops occupying South and North Korea respectively, instead of adopting a mixed occupation method, which invisibly divided the cecum of Korea, leading to the consequences of today's division. At the Yalta Conference in 1945, the Soviet Union further made territorial demands on some islands of the Korean Peninsula, and President Roosevelt was also forced to agree. In December of the same year, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference decided that the United States and the Soviet Union would occupy North and South Korea respectively, and a joint committee would be organized by representatives of the military command to assist in the establishment of a Korean Provisional Government, and then build a unified democratic and autonomous government. However, before Korea is fully independent, it still needs to go through five years of trusteeship. At first, the Korean people opposed the trusteeship and the division of the country by the US and Soviet troops, fully demonstrating the spirit of national independence, and then followed the US and the Soviet Union, and left and right factions rose in politics, as well as middle factions who were neither pro-American nor pro-Soviet. The US and Soviet troops built a fence on the 38th parallel north latitude, and Korean political parties also established fortresses under this fence, arguing with each other and opposing each other.

From a geopolitical point of view, geographical separation determines political separation, and the separation of South and North Korea seems to have been destined by power politics. From the establishment of the US-Soviet Joint Committee in Seoul in March 1946 to the passage of the seven resolutions by the UN General Assembly on November 14 last year, there was little harmonious atmosphere between the US and the Soviet Union, but the geographical division between the North and the South was deepened. After the adoption of the UN resolution, the Soviet Union refused to cooperate; the work of the Korean Committee established in accordance with the UN resolution in South Korea was even met with contempt by North Korea, placing the representatives of the committee in an embarrassing situation. The committee initially wanted to harmonize the North and South Korean factions, but later fully supported South Korea, and even became a campaign team for the South Korean election on May 10. The parliament of South Korea, with the support of Syngman Rhee and Kim Seong-soo, etc., is going to establish a conservative government, and its diplomatic purpose is to be pro-American. The North Korean constitution has already been completed. According to Kim Il-sung's political line, the government to be established through general elections is a communist government, and its internal and foreign affairs are completely dictated by the Soviet Union. Under these two extreme situations, the middle factions such as Kim Gu and Kim Kyu-sik are in the most tragic situation. On the one hand, they are saddened by the tragedy of the division of their motherland and intend to reverse the situation, and on the other hand, they lack the open and aboveboard attitude of politicians. They still cannot help but follow the trend and turn to the North Korean forces. Some people say that the left turn of Kim Gu, Kim Kyu-sik, etc., is a failure of the US rule in Korea. Recently, the United States has felt the distress of being in a dilemma in its policy towards Korea, all of which are errors caused by adopting a passive policy towards Korea and the Far East.

The so-called South Korea is the area south of the 38th parallel north latitude on the Korean Peninsula; this area accounts for two-thirds of the total Korean population, and most of its production relies on food. The only armed force in South Korea is a 30,000-strong police force and 23,000 US troops. The US military occupies South Korea, spending nearly 250 million US dollars a year, which is paying a heavy price to defend this half of the straight intestine. The United States is indeed temporarily considering a way to withdraw from South Korea. As long as the US-Soviet relations improve, the United States will inevitably withdraw from South Korea. As for North Korea, it is the area north of the 38th parallel north latitude on the Korean Peninsula, which is larger than South Korea, but the population accounts for only one-third of the total Korean population. It also has most of Korea's industries and produces the electricity needed for the country. North Korea is very well-armed and can have a 125,000-strong People's Communist Army, supported by 50,000 Soviet troops, with well-trained troops and strong weapons. If we compare the strength of North and South Korea, once something happens, the US army's position in Korea, which is far from being outnumbered, will be extremely fragile. The United States handed over the responsibility of defending South Korea to the UN Committee to replace the US military government, which is very different from the policy towards Japan, indicating the weakness and retrogression of the US policy towards Korea. As a result, the weaker the US policy, the more Korean political parties turn to North Korea. North Korea takes one step forward, and South Korea takes two steps back. The failure of the US ruling policy in South Korea is almost a foregone conclusion.

Looking at the trend, the division of Korea into North and South is unavoidable. The emergence of two governments means that a civil war similar to that in Greece is almost approaching Korea. From the 11th and 12th of this month, it shows that the short-handed encounter between the two Koreas is already on the string. In short, the evolution and development of this situation will be extremely unfavorable to the peace of China and the Far East. Therefore, we want to call the attention of US and Soviet politicians: they should be responsible for the division of Korea and the performance of the Korean tragedy. The fire on the Greek Peninsula was not set by the Greeks, but by the powers holding spears who burned the historical, civilized, and material civilizations of Greece. The current situation in Korea is the same as the crisis in Greece. It is not the 30 million Korean people who will destroy Korea and burn Korea, but the powerful who talk about geopolitics, military strategies, and situations!

### Security Council Issues New Ceasefire Order, Condemning Holy Land War Threatens Peace; Arab and Jewish Sides Prepare to Accept Unconditionally

[U.S. Information Service, Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations Security Council tonight approved the U.S. resolution by roll-call vote. It calls for the Arab and Jewish sides to cease hostilities within three days. The Security Council approved the nine-point resolution section by section, but the final approval awaits a vote on the entire resolution. Representatives from nine countries voted in favor of the provision to cease hostilities within three days. Syria voted against, and Argentina abstained. The section on the threat to peace posed by the situation in Palestine was approved by a roll-call vote of eight to one, with two abstentions.

[United Press, Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations Security Council passed a proposal tonight ordering the Arab and Jewish sides in Palestine to cease hostilities within three days. In Jerusalem, an unconditional ceasefire must be implemented within 24 hours. The new ceasefire order is stricter than previous resolutions. Any party, Arab or Jewish, that disregards this order will be seen as disrupting world peace. In that case, the Security Council must immediately consider various measures to implement the ceasefire order. The new resolution also stipulates that the United Nations mediator, Count Bernadotte, will supervise the ceasefire and continue to mediate between the Arab and Jewish sides. Soviet representative Malik expressed opposition, believing that Bernadotte was attempting to undermine the partition plan. British representative Jebb stated that the Security Council should pay full attention to Arab complaints about the unfair implementation of the previous truce agreement. While Britain supported the U.S. proposal, it did not recognize the Arabs as aggressors.

[Reuters, London, 16th] Reports from Cairo and Tel Aviv indicate that both the Arab and Jewish sides are expected to accept unconditionally the new ceasefire order passed by the Security Council, which will take effect on Sunday night. This is a significant boost for the frequently criticized prestige of the United Nations. The Arab League has reportedly notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations that it may not be able to implement a truce in the Jerusalem area starting tomorrow, but Israel has ordered its commander in the Jerusalem area to begin an indefinite truce within twelve hours. When news of the ceasefire resolution passed by the Security Council reached Arab capitals, the public was agitated. Students in Cairo marched in opposition to accepting the truce, chanting "Down with America." However, high-level authorities clearly intended to comply with the Security Council resolution. Arab League Secretary-General Azzam acknowledged at a press conference that Arab countries had no choice but to accept the truce to avoid sanctions. Jews in Tel Aviv cheered upon hearing the news, viewing it as a complete hope for peace. Meanwhile, Count Bernadotte has prepared to leave Lake Success and return to Palestine to supervise the implementation of the new truce. British representative Jebb stated that in the current difficult stage of the Palestine issue, hesitant steps would be a fatal blow to the entire international peace mechanism. U.S. representative Jessup expressed hope that this truce would not be wasted again to avoid losing this last opportunity. The Egyptian representative declined to comment pending instructions from Cairo. A British Foreign Office spokesperson acknowledged that the renewed ceasefire had brought optimistic hope but felt that a lot of work was still needed to sort out the entire issue.

### Soviet Representative to the Security Council, Gromyko, Returned Home Yesterday; New Representative Malik Attended Meeting for the First Time

### Soviet Union May Further Blockade Austrian Capital

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] According to information revealed on the 15th, Western countries are currently studying the possibility of the Soviet Union following the example of Berlin and ordering restrictions on traffic in the Vienna area of ​​Austria. Authoritative sources said that if the Soviet Union suddenly did this, the United States, Britain, and France "would not be surprised." Although Vienna is also under the control of the four powers, it is located deep within the Soviet occupation zone, mirroring Berlin.

### President Truman's Message to Congress, Calling for a Special Session of Congress; Republicans Said This Move is Purely Political in Nature

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Most Republicans were angry on the 15th at President Truman's request to convene a special parliamentary session on July 26.

[United Press, Washington, 15th] President Truman returned to the White House today and immediately, with the "national interest" as the top priority, formally requested Congress to convene a special meeting on the 26th of this month. The Republican Party scoffed at it as a kind of "downward policy", "借尸还魂" and "trickery".

Some Democratic councillors also expect that the meeting may not be successful. Others called it a positive action. This special meeting can be regarded as an unexpected gain for the Democratic Party convention, or it can determine this year's presidential election campaign. However, Du's political enemies also have no weak opportunities to speak in Congress, and Congress can still pass various bills that the president opposes. At the time when Congress is adjourned, the people across the country feel that holding a special meeting is of no avail. According to Democratic Vice President candidate Barkley, the president's decision is brave and justified, while Republican Senate Speaker Vandenberg said that this is the last gasp of the full-term government, which is entirely due to political action.

### U.S. and British Pacific Fleets to Hold Joint Exercises; British Headquarters to Move from Hong Kong to Singapore Next Month

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 16th] Seven warships of the British Pacific Fleet, led by Commander-in-Chief Bowyer, will sail to Japan at the lower side to participate in exercises with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Bowyer's flagship is the Ten Thousand Smooth Patrol Ship "London", and the other ships are the Ten Thousand Smooth Patrol Ship "Sussex", the destroyers "苏克", "康斯登斯", "柯莫斯", "康 特" and "哈特". Bowyer will take the opportunity to bid farewell to the Allied leaders in Japan, as the headquarters of the British Pacific Fleet will be moved from Hong Kong to Singapore at the end of August. According to the Daily Chronicle, the official organ of the Soviet Military Government General 文机, Soviet aviation experts believe that the scope of the air corridor from West Germany to Berlin is too wide, and the Soviet authorities have decided to restrict flights in the corridor to ensure safety. Germans close to the Soviet Military Government said that the漏洞 mentioned by the Soviet political official is the air response between Berlin and West Germany. According to the German political official, "After the Western countries received the Soviet reply, no matter what action they take, the Soviet Union's policy towards Berlin will never change. It would be a big mistake to think that the Soviet reply meant that Moscow was willing to discuss the German issue with the four powers. Western powers are willing to hold such negotiations, and the Soviet Union may agree, but the Soviet Union will never take the initiative. The real meaning of the Soviet Lingwen is that the request to lift the blockade has been definitively rejected. Early full Soviet control of Berlin has a significant impact on the Soviet Union, just as the maintenance of the Soviet Union's power in the Balkans and its control over the Tartar Nair reflect on the Soviet Union's policy in the same way. Berlin is the center of Western European political, economic, and transportation, and it must be controlled by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union will never relax its efforts to force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin. Sokolovsky has brought Stalin's latest instructions from Moscow and will strictly implement them. The hasty discussions currently underway in Western countries will not affect the Soviet Union's policy in Germany, because the Soviet Union's policy in Germany has long been definitively determined."

The General Confederation of Labor's softened stance was likely based on these reasons.

### Moscow Plans to Implement Severe Sanctions Against Yugoslav Communist Leaders

[Reuters, Dispatch from London, March 15th] London diplomatic sources are convinced that Moscow has abandoned all hope of overthrowing or reforming Marshal Tito at the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress next Wednesday and has therefore begun planning to impose severe sanctions on Yugoslav Communist leaders. Today's communiqué, published in the capital of Romania by the Cominform, contained scathing attacks on the four leading Yugoslav Communists, stating that the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress, convened under a reign of terror, cannot be considered to represent the true opinions of party members. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union and the Cominform's actions to impose sanctions on the Yugoslav Communist leaders are not far off.

### Soldiers Cause Trouble at Two Theaters; Grenade Attack Causes 21 Deaths and Injuries; 23 Suspects Arrested and Transferred to Garrison Headquarters After Interrogation

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Incidents of soldiers causing disturbances at theaters have been occurring frequently lately. Although the authorities have repeatedly tried to prevent them, the situation has actually become more serious. Last night, the Grand Theater on Jiujiang Road and the Gong Stage on Zhongzheng East Road, two major Peking opera theaters, were once again the scenes of soldiers from passing troops gathering to cause trouble due to not being able to watch the performances, even throwing several hand grenades, resulting in a tragic incident with more than a dozen deaths and injuries. A dispute also occurred at the Golden Grand Theater on Jinling East Road, but it was quickly resolved. When the hand grenades exploded at the Grand Theater and the Gong Stage, many passersby were unfortunately injured, and the audience was greatly frightened. After the incident, military police and police flying squads maintaining order arrived upon hearing the news and arrested 23 soldiers who caused the trouble at the two locations. They were interrogated by the First Battalion of the Military Police Regiment this morning and transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for handling.

At 8:00 PM last night, after the evening performance at the Grand Theater began, more than 20 soldiers from a passing youth army, led by Ma Chi and Xia Jie, came and demanded free admission to watch the performance. The resident military police and theater inspector Xia Xiongzhang informed them that the regulations for entertaining soldiers were on Sundays, and free admission was not allowed at other times. The soldiers left unhappily. About 40 minutes later, they gathered 60-70 people and, led by Ma Chi and others, returned to the theater to force their way inside. The military police quickly stopped them. While the two sides were arguing at the theater entrance, someone among the rioting soldiers threw a hand grenade, which exploded loudly on the sidewalk east of the gate. Dong Xing, a 31-year-old electrician from Ningbo, was watching an advertisement there and was killed on the spot. In addition, the shrapnel injured theater employees Liu Jinfa, Fan Hengda, Fan Xianzhang, Chen Yungeng, Wu Xijiu, and passersby Tan Kexiang, Pan Lichang, Chen Xinhuang, Chen Wensheng, Chen Ruiyou, Sun Hongwei, Xu Zhengshi, Sun Gui, Chen Rubao, Feng Kerong, Zhu Lilihong, Sun Xikang, and others. There was chaos as people screamed and fled. The Old Gate Branch Bureau received the report and dispatched officers led by Chief Zhao to the scene. The garrison brigade and military police also sent troops to the scene, but the soldiers who caused the trouble had already scattered, and only one suspect, Soldier Sun Deming of the 202nd Division, was arrested. The dead and injured were immediately taken to Renji Hospital.

The incident at the Grand Theater had just come to an end when another incident occurred at the Gong Stage at 10:45 PM. The theater was staging the White Snake Legend last night. After the performance began, soldiers from the Youth Army and other passing troops entered the theater one after another, and almost all the back row seats were occupied by them. Near the end of the performance, dozens of Youth Army soldiers wanted to enter the theater to watch the performance. The theater staff refused them entry because the seats were full and the performance was about to end. Unexpectedly, they forcibly pried open the iron gate and rushed in. Fearing that trouble would arise, the theater urgently telegraphed the military and police authorities. The military police and garrison personnel and police flying squads maintaining order at the Grand Theater were ordered to transfer to the Gong Stage. When they arrived, the play had ended, and the audience was exiting through the emergency exits on both sides. When the soldiers in the theater saw the military police arrive, they became greatly dissatisfied. Amid the boos, a loud bang suddenly came from the first seat in the seventh row. A soldier threw a hand grenade on the ground and it exploded. Yao Zhongfang (male) and Zhu Xianlan (female), two spectators nearby, were injured by the shrapnel. Other spectators who had not yet left the theater were terrified and fled in panic. The military police immediately arrested the soldiers in the theater suspected of causing trouble. At that time, more than 280 soldiers who had watched the performance had gathered outside the theater gate, and some had retreated into the Great World through the emergency exit. In the chaos, another hand grenade exploded in the Great World. To prevent the situation from escalating, the military police fired several shots into the air as a warning and maintained strict vigilance. Seeing that the situation was not in their favor, they dispersed reluctantly.

Among those arrested by the military police at the scene were Soldiers Xiang Guoying, Su Zongsheng, Tao Yunshu, Xiong Shaogui, Liu Xiaozhong, Liu Xiangyang, Huang Xinglong, Wu Guozheng, Chen Yumei, Chen Xianyi, Tan Dehua, Lin Guocheng, Wu Jichang, Li Xiangying of the Youth Army Independent Brigade, Staff Sergeant Wang Lexiang of the Armored Headquarters Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office, soldier Dong of the Youth Army 208th Division, soldier Yu Mingfang of the 21st Reorganized Division, as well as soldier Wei Yufu of the Tongshan Regiment Area arrested in front of the Gong Stage, Cai Aisheng, a member of the Jiading Militia, and Min of the Second Ordnance Depot of the Ministry of National Defense, and 22 others. Together with Sun Deming, arrested in front of the Grand Theater, they were all taken to the First Battalion of the Military Police on Fengyang Road at 11:30 PM. That night, they were interrogated in five groups by Battalion Adjutant Zou Li and others one by one. According to the confession of Youth Army soldier Tan Dehua, the companion who carried the hand grenade was bugler Yang Shuyun, but he had escaped in the chaos. The interrogation was completed at 1:00 AM this morning. The suspects, along with their written confessions, were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for handling.

When the incidents occurred, the theaters were extremely shocked. The Theater Guild planned to hold an emergency meeting at the Queen's Theater that night, but because the internal losses of the Grand Theater and the Gong Stage were still minor and it was already late, the meeting was rescheduled for today to discuss everything. It is also reported that the security authorities notified the commanders of various troops passing through Shanghai last night not to allow their subordinates to go out starting today.

[Another report] Last night, one hour after the incident at the Gong Stage, an injured soldier was admitted to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. He claimed to be Yang Shaoyun, and was injured by shrapnel from a hand grenade in the Great World. Because the injuries were quite serious, and his life was feared to be in danger, the hospital, out of caution, telegraphed the military police team. The team believed that this person's name was only one character different from the Yang Shuyun mentioned in Tan Dehua's confession, and suspected him of throwing the grenade. An investigation is currently underway. The military police arrested suspects at the Gong Stage and loaded them onto a garrison vehicle.

### Wu Ren Cang to Be Buried This Afternoon; Chen Guofu Comes to Shanghai to Preside

Chen Guofu and his wife arrived in Shanghai by the Triumph train at 10:30 PM last night, specially to preside over the burial of Wu Ren Cang, the late director of the Central Trust of China. When he arrived at the station, he told reporters that Director Wu was honest and upright, serious in his work, and only knew public service, not private gain.

### Those Helped Help Others; Dai Ciding Determined to Remember the Source of the Water; Responds to the Shenbao's Scholarship Campaign

Over the years, the Shenbao's "Reader Scholarship Fund" has helped many poor students, allowing them to complete their expected course of study in extremely difficult circumstances.

Now, these students may already be in society, beginning to contribute their academic abilities and serving the community.

Yesterday, we received a letter and a donation of 5 million yuan from a student who had previously received assistance from the Shenbao's "Reader Scholarship Fund." In his letter, he said:

"Editor: When I was in school, I was forced to drop out of school due to family financial difficulties, but the Shenbao's 'Reader Scholarship Fund' helped me, allowing me to avoid the misfortune of dropping out of school. Now I work in a government agency in Xuzhou, and my life is relatively stable. In order to thank you for the assistance you gave me in the past, I have saved 5 million yuan from my daily expenses and donated it to the scholarship fund to help poor students who are coming after me... Dai Ciding bowing"

Although 5 million yuan is not a large sum, remembering the source of the water contains boundless deep feelings!

I hope that every reader can embrace the mentality of feeling the hunger and drowning of others, donate more, so that the "Reader Scholarship Fund" can be launched smoothly!

### Preliminary Court Hearing of the Dance Hall Riot Case - Defendants All Claimed They Didn't Use Violence - Reporters Will Be Called as Witnesses; Trial May Conclude Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Second Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday presented the tensest situation since the start of the student movement trials. Eighty-three dance hall employees were accused of threatening to destroy the Social Affairs Bureau because of the ban on dancing. Except for Tang Zongjie, Hu Yunyuan, Yang Lili, and six others who were investigated by the District Attorney's Office, but found insufficient evidence, and Zhang Mao Mao, who was under fourteen years old, who was not prosecuted but instead called as a witness outside the court, the remaining seventy-three, including Zhu , were all prosecuted for obstructing official duties. Yesterday, the District Court increased the number of armed bailiffs for special security. The seating arrangements for reporters from various newspapers once caused a minor disturbance.

Judge Zhong Dada announced the opening of the court at 9:05 a.m. First, Li Jianying, the Chief of the Songshan Road Police Station who was present at the scene, testified about witnessing the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau. Then, the court successively summoned dance hostesses Rong Yingfeng, You Lingling, and Jin Ying, a prospective dance hostess who shouted "Show Courage!" at the Social Affairs Bureau (Jin Ying once claimed to be a female student and said she was persuaded by her "little sisters" to become a dance hostess, but she did not have a dance hostess license). All three defendants denied the statements they made at the police station. Afterwards, all the defendants claimed that they arrived at the Social Affairs Bureau after 4 p.m. and denied having destroyed anything. The police officers who were present at the scene testified yesterday that since so much time had passed, their memories of the faces of those who destroyed things were vague and they could not identify them. Only Zhang Maosheng, an employee of the Social Affairs Bureau, testified that Luo Ying, a dance hostess from the Victory Dance Hall, removed the wooden sign from the secretary's office and used it to smash glass and other objects. Luo Ying herself testified that she did not use violence and was arrested that day because her hair was disheveled.

Four Principles for Detaining Suspects

The members of the Flying Fortress Team who testified yesterday mostly said that at the time, they arrested suspects based on the four principles given by their superiors: (1) those with mud on their hands and feet; (2) those whose clothes were torn; (3) those with wounds on their faces; (4) those with disheveled hair. However, the defendants said that they were arrested mostly because they did not have their national identity cards or employee membership cards.

In the morning, a total of thirty-seven defendants were questioned before the court temporarily adjourned.

The trial resumed at 2 p.m. Zhu Fei, the most suspected person, was the first to be questioned. Zhu Fei had stated at the police station that a misunderstanding occurred in front of the Social Affairs Bureau due to the petition, leading to a crowd rushing in and destroying office items upstairs, vividly describing the situation. Other defendants also testified that they saw Zhu Fei destroying things. In court yesterday, Zhu Fei overturned his original statement, saying that at the police station, he could not bear to see the other defendants being tortured, so he stepped forward to confess. He elaborately said that his two statements contradicted each other. Judge Zhong refuted this, stating that the two statements were consistent and there were no contradictions. Zhu frequently said: "This is not the truth."

Sun Zhimin Used Photos as Evidence

Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, and Meng Yan, who were elected as representatives of the presidium at the meeting in New Wonderland, all said that they did not conspire to destroy anything and did not express any opinions during the meeting. Cha Ruili and Yang Lili, who separately testified that they saw Sun Zhimin and Meng Yan go to the second floor of the Social Affairs Bureau, were both denied by Sun and Meng as being acquaintances. Jin Meihong also testified that she tried her best to dissuade the crowd from rioting and said that a photo published in the Shen Bao could prove this. The questioning of all the defendants was completed at 3:40 p.m. At 9:30 a.m. this morning, the trial will resume in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court. More than twenty lawyers will展开辩论, and reporters and photographers who were present at the scene on the day of the incident will be called to testify. The trial may conclude tomorrow.

### Sidelines of the Opening of the Dance Hall Riot Trial

Yesterday's opening of the dance hall riot trial at the District Court drew dozens of relatives of the dance hall employees to the court to listen. Relatives without admission tickets gathered at the entrance of the District Court, peering in, reminiscent of entering a deeply guarded mansion.

A special feature of yesterday's trial was that witnesses, including members of the Flying Fortress Team and employees of the Social Affairs Bureau, gave identical answers to questions about which dance hall employees destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, saying that because time had passed and clothing had changed, they could not accurately identify them. The defendant dance hall employees generally said "I don't know," "I didn't know," "I didn't hit anyone" to the judge's questions.

Inside and Outside the Iron Bars - Two Different Appearances

The detained employees among the defendants all had hair past their ears and were shabbily dressed. Those who were released on bail still had their hair styled and shiny. Dance hostesses, whether detained or released on bail, were all simple and unadorned, without makeup.

Hong Xiaoping, a dance hostess who was not prosecuted, arrived at the court in full dress to listen, wearing Crome limited glasses, looking quite elegant. In the audience, she frequently greeted lawyers and her sisters in distress.

Qin Xianfen, who was released on bail, wore thick nearsighted glasses, looking more like an innocent female student than a dance hostess. According to her statement, the reason for her arrest was that a woman wearing glasses was seen hitting people and destroying property, but it was not her.

By noon, only half of the seventy-three defendants had been questioned. Everyone present was hungry, and a humorous note was passed in the lawyers' section: "Today is the opening of the dance hostess trial. Those attending the voluntary defense should be treated to lunch by the Shanghai Women's Association."

### Minor Incident in Court - Reporters Compete for Seats

The District Court opened yesterday with strict security, restricting photographers from taking flash photos and placing reporters' seats next to the audience seats, far away from the judge's bench, making it difficult to cover the trial. All the reporters withdrew in protest. Later, Huang Yanju, the Chief Clerk of the Court, came forward to mediate and agreed to allow reporters to take photos as usual in the court and moved their seats closer to the lawyers' section. With this, the minor incident was resolved.

They hoped the representatives would be assured and asked them to convey their condolences to the family of Qiu Yongkuan and to Li Chuanyin himself. The representatives were satisfied and dispersed.

### Lobotomy (II) - New Achievements of Young Doctor Liu Mingduo

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi

[By airmail from Qingdao, 12th of this month] He made a forced analogy: "It's like having four wires through which electricity flows; now, if you cut off one or two wires, the electricity can still continue to flow." He continued: "Some physiologists do not differentiate between regions of the frontal lobe of the brain, and regard the entire part as the spiritual master, but in fact, the extent of frontal lobectomy is more important than the area being removed!" Therefore, he said: We can think that mental illness is very likely the result of an abnormal frontal lobe synthesis capacity or an abnormal transmission connection in the frontal lobe.

Dr. Liu Mingduo quoted and selected the research results of general scholars. He mentioned that in 1936, 之Noniz used frontal lobectomy to treat a patient whose diagnosis was unclear, and the result was very good. Since then, brain surgeons have followed suit and tried it on epilepsy and schizophrenia, with particularly significant effectiveness for catatonia. Therefore, the reasons for using frontal lobectomy to treat schizophrenia and epilepsy may be due to: (1) changes in blood flow, (2) changes in lymph circulation, (3) changes in the transmission route, etc. When epilepsy occurs, the blood vessels are surrounded by glial cells, thus causing vasospasm and causing anemia, which is the real reason for seizures. Some scholars explain that patients with mental illness often have abnormal movements due to illusions and hallucinations. Yes, these hallucinations and illusions are due to the abnormal interaction of the patient's previous experiences and knowledge. If this abnormal interaction is relaxed, the illusions and hallucinations can be eliminated immediately.

"And frontal lobectomy can accomplish this task." He concluded: "So this is beneficial for patients with mental illness." Therefore, "most brain surgeons currently advocate using frontal lobectomy to treat patients with schizophrenia, mental illness with hallucinations, agitated mental illness, and severe pain caused by untreatable diseases such as cancer. They particularly advocate using lobectomy for patients with schizophrenia who are not effectively treated with insulin shock and electroshock."

"However," he also said: "This surgery is still in the experimental stage. As far as I know, there are still very few cases with results after surgery."

### Four Salt Police Officers in Jinshanwei Forcibly Purchased Rice Straw and Assaulted People

[Report from Our Newspaper, Jinshan, 14th of this month] The third squadron of the salt police stationed in the west gate of Jinshanwei city has always had local people provide straw at low prices, and salt police officers often forcibly purchase straw and give extremely low prices. The villagers carrying straw all regard the west gate as a dangerous place. On the 10th of this month, four police officers from the salt police squadron went to the home of Ma Quansheng, a resident of Xicang in the seventh bao, to purchase . Quansheng's mother first gave them one load, but the salt police officers wanted to more than fill the gap and insisted on buying two loads. When Gao's mother argued slightly, she was escorted to the salt field office and brutally beaten. When her son Quansheng heard the news, he went to request her release. The four salt police officers then hung up Quansheng and his brother's wife and beat them. The town's militia learned of the incident and requested the release of Gao Quansheng's mother and brother's wife, but the salt police's attitude was tough. They immediately gathered police officers, armed with guns and live ammunition, as if facing a formidable enemy. Fortunately, Liu Zhi, the captain of the second security mountain team of the county, came forward to mediate, and the salt battalion finally agreed to release Gao and the other four. However, they were covered in salt injuries and their lives were at risk. It is said that they have already requested justice from the local public opinion organs.

### Strange Customer at a Restaurant in Hangzhou - Eats a Full Meal and Doesn't Pay - Willing to Give Away Six-Year-Old Daughter - Officer Teng Generously Helps with Travel Expenses

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Hangzhou, 15th] A tragic incident occurred in Hangzhou on the 14th at noon, involving a man exchanging his daughter for a meal. Xie Yaohui from Ganzhou, Jiangxi, brought his six-year-old daughter to Duoyichu Restaurant on Yanling Road for lunch, consuming over 1.3 million yuan worth of food. When the waiter asked for payment, Xie claimed he had no money and offered to give his daughter to the restaurant unconditionally. The restaurant staff criticized him for ordering food when he had no money. Xie argued that he had raised his daughter to the age of six, and giving her away for a full meal was not excessive. The restaurant, considering his unreasonable argument, took him to the Second Branch Bureau. Xie confessed: He is 33 years old, a retired military officer. Seven years ago, after getting married, he had this daughter, named Xiaofu, who is now six years old. After retiring from the military after the victory of the war against Japan, he was unemployed for many years. His wife, unable to endure hardship, eloped with a general-level officer, leaving him and his daughter to depend on each other. He arrived in Hangzhou from Ganzhou five days ago, staying at Lake View Hotel No. 18. He had run out of travel funds and was penniless. Therefore, he planned to give his daughter away and go to Shanghai alone to seek work. The bureau, recognizing his situation, released him after he wrote a letter of repentance. An officer named Teng at the bureau also donated 500,000 yuan for his travel expenses.

### Floating Capital Enters Various Markets - Prices Once Again Rise Across the Board

[Report from our newspaper] After two days of stability, prices in this city rose across the board again yesterday. Prices of cotton cloth, rice, and daily necessities all increased by more than 10%. According to analysis by relevant sources, the main reasons for the price rebound are as follows: (1) A batch of floating capital from North China, estimated at around 4 trillion, which had previously been frozen, has now entered the market. (2) The Four Banks yesterday approved production loans for cooperative enterprises, amounting to about 3 trillion, which will be disbursed within days. (3) The cost of living index released the day before rose by nearly 100%, affecting the cost of factories and indirectly stimulating the prices of daily necessities.

Hua stocks experienced another all-around surge yesterday afternoon. Yongsha was sold at an additional 700 yuan after hitting the daily price limit. Due to floating capital, the price of cotton cloth rose, and hoarding was rampant. Stockholders were reluctant to sell, and the market soared, with Longtou fine cloth approaching the 4,000 mark. Due to firm rice prices in Wuxi and no further price drops, coupled with easing credit, stockholders were reluctant to sell easily, and the prices of all grades of rice rose universally, with top-grade white rice exceeding 30 million. Other daily necessities all rose due to the increase in the cost of living index and factories adjusting their wages.

Furthermore, the black market interest rates in this city were unprecedentedly high yesterday. The black market interest rate for cotton yarn once reached as high as 1,400 yuan per thousand, and the stock market interest rate also reached as high as 900 yuan per thousand. The general market interest rate was 5 jiao, and the interbank day loan interest rate also reached as high as 3 jiao. However, although interest rates were high, prices still rose, which shows that people are optimistic about the market, and merchants are willing to borrow at high interest rates to purchase goods. This is a characteristic of the current price surge and may indirectly indicate an impending economic crisis.

### Rice Prices Rise Uniformly - White Jing and Bo Dao Return to the 30 Million Mark

The rice market rebounded again due to rising quotations in Wuxi and the overall increase in prices of other goods. Although credit was tight, stockholders held firm on prices. Prices rose by 2 million yuan in the early market, but some stockholders, unable to withstand the pressure of tight funds, sold more goods at the close, leading to a slight pullback, but still an increase of about 1.5 million yuan. At the North City Market, Jing Bo Dao and Yang Xian all returned to the 30 million mark, with special-grade Gao Jing reaching 33 million. At the South City Market, Songjiang Bo Shao was 30 million, Bai Yin Yuan was 30 million, and crude Xian rice mills still had strong demand, adding 1 to 2 million. 4,369 stones of goods arrived at the two markets.

Flour Continued to rise, opening immediately with the rice prices above, the goods circle rose, the holding person held very strong.

Miscellaneous grains All-round soaring, under the agitation of rising rice prices and other goods in the circle, people's hearts were very firm. Due to high prices in Hankou and large exchange water, the price of yellow beans was not suitable for planning, and the seller was very light. The opening price of Zha beans was 14.5 million, and then the price of oil cakes rose, and then increased by 1 million, and the closing was tired. The corn rose by 3 million, the Qing Gang Naxi took, and the clumsy beans added a million. The Yuan wheat North Gang had an office, which was up 2 million. The green bean sales were very dull, slightly increasing by 1 million, and the sesame seed was raised by 2 to 3 million. The raw benevolence was absorbed by the Guangdong Gang, and jumped up by 5 to 6 million.

Edible oil Continued to rise, due to the consistent rise in raw materials such as soybeans, and the overall increase in the price of other goods, the scattered households were strong, and the suction was very strong. Although the oil factory has opened, it is still in short supply. The opening price of soybean oil increased by 10%, which was 66 million. The amount of floating was more than 1 million, and it returned to a low of 1 million, and the Shang Ya increased by 5 million.

### Stagnation of Fur Exports - The Industry Makes Two Major Demands

At present, China's fur industry has encountered a severe crisis, especially on the export side, where losses are too great, and merchants generally regard the foreign market as a path of fear. There are two reasons for this situation: (1) The legal exchange rate of the national currency against the US dollar is too low. Although there is a certificate price, it is almost half the price of the black market foreign exchange. Moreover, farmers' thinking is stubborn, and they use rice prices as a measure. Before the war, a pair of yellow wolves could be exchanged for one stone of white rice, but now they can only be exchanged for five dou, so they try to increase the selling price as much as possible, which affects the export quantity. (2) After the Foreign Exchange Audit Office of the Central Bank promulgated the measures for the settlement of foreign exchange for consignment exports, it has severely hit the consignment method adopted in recent years. As fur is subject to seasonality, if the exchange settlement is limited to a certain period, merchants cannot actively strive for normal market prices. At the moment, the industry hopes that the government can implement a fur export self-defense program. (1) The method of limiting the settlement of foreign exchange to three months should be revised, and it is hoped that the deadline will be extended as much as possible. (2) The price of the certificate must be increased so that the exchange rate of the foreign exchange obtained can adapt to the price and cost of living index.

### Cash Shortage in Southwest Provinces

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market Shows a Promising Trend - Fine Yarn Price Jumps by 200 Million Yuan Compared to the Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was favorable due to the environment and the revitalization of non-industry materials. The hearts of the people suddenly became firm, and the Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, and Guangdong gangs, as well as new buyers and short covering, all rose together. The market was full of buying interest, but the money supply was still tight, and most transactions were for next-day funds. The initial opening of 42s Blue Phoenix jumped to around 150 million. Later, the price rose again as the stockholders held firm. At the near close, those who were squeezed by funds slightly sold off, and finally ended at 1.65 billion yuan, rebounding 200 million yuan from the previous day. Next-day delivery also squeezed up 150 million yuan. Due to the large supply and sale of 21s Double Horse yarn, the current exit rebounded 190 million, and the tomorrow exit was up 140 million. The remaining various counts of coarse and fine yarns also increased by 1-200 million or more. Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation was due to the sharp increase in the index, the increased cost of manufacturers, the imminent issuance of large banknotes, and the raging dust. Although the money supply was still secretly tight, the rumors of floating capital arriving in Shanghai were circulating, and the Sichuan, Han, Hunan, and Tianjin gangs all absorbed it, and new buying and hoarding were active, and the stockholders took the opportunity to turn the price, and the market suddenly became strong.

The initial call price of Longtou fine cloth was 37 million yuan. Later, due to the secret absorption of financial gangs, it gradually rose to the 40 million mark. The search was very short, and finally ended at 39.5 million yuan, a squeeze of about 15% compared to the previous day. Five blessings, blue chickens, trumpets, children, and other grades of fine cloth also rebounded by 1-20% or more. In addition, bib cloth, coarse cloth, and color cloth and shilin cloth also flourished in the market.

Also, Zhongfang yesterday sold 245 pieces of cotton yarn on behalf of the yarn tube association in the market, recovering 29,481,000,000 yuan. Another 810 pieces were auctioned, recovering 106.15 billion yuan.

The situation of cotton distribution in Wuxi yarn mills

[Report from our newspaper] The yarn tube association has spread that the cotton stock of Wuxi factories is insufficient. Yesterday, the spokesperson actually stated: "The Wuxi factories that have successively signed contracts with the association to handle cotton distribution and yarn exchange include Tiantong, Gongtai, and Xinyi. The ones that are approved by the association to issue cotton purchase certificates and decorated with their own purchases include Dehua, Tianyuan, Yuankang, and Zhenxin. Recently, Jinxin has applied to the association for cotton distribution, and the investigation procedures are being handled. Another Qingfeng was approved for distribution the month before, but more than half a month has passed, and they have not come to the meeting to handle the signing procedures, and have automatically given up. From this, it can be seen that the shortage of cotton stock in the factories in the area may not be as rumored. However, the wood association has a supply plan for the cotton used by each yarn factory, and has ordered the six district associations to report the number of cotton stocks and cotton used by each member factory in Wuxi.

Also, since Wang Lansen, acting chairman of the yarn tube association, has been in charge of the association, he is determined to carry out reforms. He has sent a letter to Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and intends to transfer Ma Lianfang, a specialist commissioner from the ministry, to the association as the deputy director of the transportation department.

If it is necessary to establish secondary schools, the priority should be junior high schools, simplified normal schools, or junior vocational schools. It was decided not to approve the establishment of high schools and the Shaanxi Education Department has been notified to comply.

### From Public Order to Physical Assault and Verbal Abuse

— Suo Bei

In Shanghai, no one doesn't shake their head when public order is mentioned.

Let's start with the streets: When traffic police are on duty in the streets, pedicabs and "yellow cabs" proceed in order, albeit reluctantly and impatiently. But once these officers are off duty, all vehicles proceed side-by-side, chaotic and disordered.

Next to tram and bus stops, even under the supervision of armed military police, queues are sometimes impossible to form, because those who "physically assault" and "verbally abuse" are never restrained. Everyone probably remembers that right after the victory, some passengers on Shanghai trams were accustomed to climbing in through the windows and jumping out through the windows. Even today, there are those who demand that the vehicle stop before reaching the stop, and there are also cases of beating the driver and assaulting the ticket seller. In the past month, such disputes have been reported repeatedly in the newspapers.

Let's talk about theaters: After the victory, the authorities implemented a beneficial policy, which was that all theaters would assign seats. However, at the beginning of the implementation, many difficulties were encountered. Although the numbered seating system has now been successfully established, incidents of physical altercations in theaters due to some people's lack of orderliness seem to be extremely commonplace news.

As for the small number of ordinary citizens who are willing to abide by order, they mostly belong to the "weak minority". They certainly hate the breakdown of order, but they are also powerless to do anything about it, so they are also very good at "becoming accustomed to it". Nowadays, they especially seem unwilling to interfere. In the past, if someone smoked on a tram or in a theater, many others would come forward to boo him a few times or say a few words to show disapproval. This phenomenon has disappeared now. As for the good habit of giving up seats to women and children on trams, it has also become less common recently.

It is said that from August 1st, the "ban on spitting" will be strictly enforced, but in today's Shanghai, where there is "physical assault and verbal abuse," this measure is causing people to be nervously concerned that it might trigger a few more "three-legged iron rooster" performances.

Not long ago, an article by a foreign reporter said: "From Shanghai to Tokyo, it is like ascending from a chaotic world to a peaceful paradise." Is this statement excessive? Everyone should ask themselves!

### American Soldiers' Illegitimate Children Left Overseas

— Kuan Nai

During World War II, the total number of illegitimate children born to American soldiers serving overseas with local women reached about 500,000. Except for a very small number who were able to reunite with their biological fathers, most of these children have been "forgotten".

Where have these children been left? A rough estimate is as follows: (1) North Africa, 5,000; (2) mainland Britain, 22,000; (3) Italy, 10,000; (4) Belgium, 5,000 in Brussels alone; (5) Germany, France, and Austria, a total of 63,000; (6) China, Japan, Australia, and other Far Eastern countries, a total of about 200,000.

The US government has not yet developed a specific plan to address this issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin formally stated in Parliament that "Britain had requested the US government to provide financial assistance to these illegitimate children of American soldiers left in Britain and their mothers, but ultimately no agreement could be reached." (This article is adapted from this month's "Reader's Digest").

### Clever Pigs

— Song Pu

We often hear the insulting phrase: "You stupid pig!" In fact, that is wrong. Pigs are not necessarily all "stupid." Clever pigs are not few in number, but they have not been noticed by people all along. Here are a few examples:

Some hunters in the United States have domesticated and trained piglets to help people find truffles in the woods. They are called "hunting pigs."

The French often take pigs to the forest to find truffles and other fungi. These fungi are hidden deep in the roots of trees, and there is no sign of them from the ground. However, the pig's long nose can smell the fragrance. After sniffing it out, it will dig down with its nose. The person collecting the fungi must drive the pig away in time, otherwise the fragrant fungus will be eaten by the pig.

In the past, there was a famous pig in an American circus that could count the number of cards. The owner gave it a card printed with a number, and it would tap the ground with its front feet. The number of taps was always the same as the number on the card. Although the circus owner would make a signal, it is still a rare feat that it could know the number of times it was tapping.

### "Fake Newspapers"

— Hai Si

Since the "fake newspaper" can satisfy at least two conditions, the film can become a real and complete historical document and an exciting story. One is that every piece of news must be consistent with its time period, and there must be no news about "atomic bombs" appearing in the background film, as that would violate the time period.

In order to meet these two conditions, Hayes has established a newspaper archive, collecting hundreds of newspapers from all over the world, the earliest of which was published in 1769. With this archive, he is able to coordinate the fake news needed in the film with the real news that occurred at the same time. For example, when he "edits" a "screen newspaper" with the death of the great thief John Dillinger as the headline, he inserts a picture of a flood in China in the newspaper, because both events happened in 1934.

However, because the audience never has time to read all the news other than the news that the director wants to convey, Hayes uses his newspaper archive to fill in the gaps, casually throwing in random fragments. Sometimes, the subtitles of two "screen newspapers" with different headlines are actually the same. Of course, the audience will not notice this "minor flaw".

Now, in addition to newspapers, Hayes's archive also contains more than 10,000 posters and phone books, hundreds of legal notices, and thousands of postcards. Upon receipt of a notice, he can immediately supply or compile an Irish horse racing ticket, a Mumbai menu, a medical diploma from 1840, or a sticker on a Greek wine bottle - and of course, the "screen newspaper".

### Near Works of Xia An

— Ye Gongwei

With wine, I can complete the scene beyond the world, embracing the accumulated moss in the cold, empty mountain; from now on, I will no longer talk about the matter of harmonizing the soup, but only be happy with the plum blossoms.

I heard that a branch of plum blossoms is sold for a million coins, a strange thing in the world that is difficult to express in words; since spring colors are not abundant, they are only found in tall buildings and wide houses.

Titled on the old brush with the Korean name Bang Lang Guan engraved by Li, the artistic workshop of the Wang family is carefully made

When will the magic brush be used to spread the army's message? The fallen king has been homeless for a long time today! It is tragic to see Bang Lang become collapsed earth, and the blood-stained Jifeng is as chaotic as hemp.

### The Eighty-Two Year Old Hanlin Scholar Mr. Cao Shuyan

— Shulu

The continuing of a marital bond of eighty-two year old Hanlin scholar Cao Yuanbi (Shuyan) of Wumen is a delightful story, and has been widely reported in newspapers both north and south. I read in the "Ling Xiaohan Pavilion Conversations" published in this newspaper on the 11th of this month a clarification of the title "Old Hanlin Scholar" applied to Cao, stating that one who passes the imperial examination but does not enter the Hanlin Academy should not be generally called a Hanlin scholar, and that people often do not distinguish between the two, which is indeed correct. However, Cao's being called a Hanlin scholar is not incorrect. According to records, Cao was a Jinshi in the Jiawu year of the Guangxu reign (the "Conversations" stating the Yiewei year is also an error). At that time, calligraphy was highly valued in the palace examination. Cao, due to a vision problem, could not write in proper regular script, so he was not included in the palace examination and was instead employed as a secretary in the Grand Secretariat. Later, in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, Chen Qitai, the Governor of Jiangsu, submitted a memorial presenting Cao's early work "Annotations and Explanations of the Classics of Rituals," citing the precedent of Wang Weiyun who was awarded the title of Compiler of the Hanlin Academy by imperial decree for his book written as a Juren. Cao was also granted the title of Compiler of the Hanlin Academy by imperial edict, and the original book "Annotations and Explanations of the Classics of Rituals" was sent to the Ritual Studies Institute for study. Details are recorded in the Qing Veritable Records. Cao's second elder brother, Fuyuan, also served as a Compiler of the Hanlin Academy and later as the Circuit Intendant of Kaigui Zhengxu in Henan, acting as the Governor. Brothers both in the Hanlin Academy, their family was prominent and a respected clan in Wumen. (The eldest brother, Yuanheng, known as Mr. Cangzhou, was famous as a physician and was once summoned to diagnose the illness of Emperor Dezong of Qing. A cousin, Yuanzhong, served as a Reader in the Grand Secretariat and was known for his erudition, authoring works such as the "Jianjing Studio Collection," etc.) The "Conversations" only knew about his initial position but did not examine that he later obtained the distinguished Hanlin position. Furthermore, the "Conversations" stated that he was respected by famous public officials and dignitaries for his expertise in literary composition, textual research, bronze and stone inscriptions, and book editions, but did not mention Cao's profound knowledge of the classics, making him a prominent figure in the country. His published works include "Annotations and Explanations of the Classics of Rituals," "Explanations of Zheng's Commentary on the Zhou Yi," "Supplementary Corrections to the Collected Explanations of the Zhou Yi," "Annotations and Explanations of Zheng's Commentary on the Classic of Filial Piety," "Zhou Yi Studies," "Classics of Rituals Studies," "Collected Works of the Fuli Hall," and more than ten other works such as "Poetry on Learning," all beautifully written and meticulously carved, representing monumental works. Even at his advanced age of over eighty, he still diligently studies at his desk, writing "Annotations and Explanations of Zheng's Commentary on the Book of Documents," demonstrating his clear mind and serving as a spiritual beacon like the ancient Lu Palace. As for the matter of continuing his marital bond, it seems to be surprising, but it is not known that Cao is blind and had a close, lifelong friendship with Tang Wenzhi, and they suffered from the same illness. In his daily life, he needed constant support and care. Since the passing of Madam Wang, more than ten years ago, his cousin Zhang Hong (also known as a Jinshi and the author of "Sequel to the Flower in a Sinful Sea") from Changshu has accompanied him day and night. He originally had no intention of remarrying, but his cousin suddenly passed away this spring at the age of seventy, leaving him lonely and helpless, which led to this unprecedented decision. Therefore, Cao wrote in a letter to a friend, "Continuing the marital bond is a way to continue my life, and it is an innovative approach in the world," which shows his suffering. The writer lives near Cao's residence, so I know the details and record them to inform the readers.

### "Newspaperman" of the Film Capital

— Mao Yi

The next time you watch a Hollywood movie, if there is a close-up of a newspaper on the screen, please pay attention to the name of the newspaper. It is probably not one you are familiar with, and even Americans have never heard of it. This is true for every film.

To know the truth behind this, one should ask Er Hayes, the editor, publisher, and printer of these newspapers that only appear on the screen. Hayes is a lean, smiling printer who specializes in printing things for the screen. The newspapers, posters, advertisements, telegrams, menus, theater tickets, and legal notices used in various film studios are almost all handled by him alone.

When a newspaper is to appear on the screen, it must be fictional to avoid legal disputes that might arise from using real newspapers. At the same time, special attention must be paid to the production of anything that the audience has time to read, such as headline titles, to avoid viewers with fast reading speeds "seeing through." For example, in a film set during World War I... Zheng Ji

### A Record of the Changhong Society

— Zheng Jiyun

There are many art groups in Shanghai. Those that I know of include the Pinghua Society, the Qiuying Society, and the Hanzhiyou Society. Their literary and artistic works have been widely circulated and provide ample evidence. The Changhong Society also has a long history and continues to exist to this day. Many of its members are elders, especially Shen Xinhai, who inherited the mantle of Qian Huian and enjoyed a great reputation for decades. Zhu Liangcai was also a prominent figure in the society. Although he has passed away, his works are passed down through generations and treasured as precious artifacts. At that time, the members often visited Huhainan, where Shen Xinhai's talented student, Xie Xian'ou, lived in Hejia Branch Street near the Dananmen, not far from Shen. They frequently visited each other to discuss art, enjoying many mornings and evenings together. They then formed the Changhong Society, which was established in Xie Xian'ou's home, and published the Changhong Painting Collection. During the recent incident, the Japanese invaders committed atrocities, and the Dananmen area suffered even more severe devastation, and the Changhong Society was reduced to ashes. Xie Xian'ou fled in a panic, not knowing where to go. After barely catching his breath, he tried to restore the society. At that time, Shen Xinhai had not yet passed away. The society's location was initially on Gordon Road, and then moved to the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road, facing Aili Garden across the street. It used art to gather friends, and the members numbered in the dozens, all renowned artists of the time. This summer, an exhibition of fan paintings was held, featuring landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds, everything was available. It is said that a fan exhibition will be held soon, and the society's affairs are flourishing, which is gratifying.

### Prison in China

— Gongsun Wu

Zhang Taiyan was imprisoned in Shanghai Prison for three years due to the Subao case. In his prison diary from the Guimao year, he stated that he was thirty-six years old at the time, which was forty-six years ago. The prison officials at the time, both Westerners and Chinese, have mostly passed away, but some of Zhang Taiyan's old friends still know a little about the matter. All prisoners had work to do. Zhang Taiyan was initially assigned to the dining hall, washing dishes. Later, due to his frail constitution, he was reassigned to sewing. The prison life of a great master was no different from that of convicted criminals today. People in prison like to read Buddhist scriptures. Zou Rong also often asked Zhang Taiyan to explain Buddhism to him. Zhang Taiyan taught him Buddhist logic, saying that learning it could relieve his worries for three years. Zou Rong was young and angered by the inhumane treatment of prisoners by Westerners, and he soon became ill and died. Zhang Taiyan had already glimpsed the Buddhist scriptures, "delving into the Avatamsaka Sutra, the Nirvana Sutra, and other sutras." Since being imprisoned, he "specialized in the books of Maitreya and Vasubandhu. This is a method that begins with analyzing terms and ends with rejecting terms. The path of entry is similar to my lifelong practical learning, making it easy to adapt. After understanding this, one can reach the profound interest of Mahayana Buddhism. I privately believe that the profound words of Shakyamuni far surpass the philosophers of the late Zhou Dynasty, and the teachings of Cheng and Zhu are even less worthy of discussion." This is how he described himself. Then, not seeing the outside world for three years does not harm one's studies.

### 

The imperial examination system has a miraculous effect in breaking down class barriers. The so-called "ten years of hard study by a cold window, a moment of fame," the so-called "three-foot waves in the Yu Gate, a thunderclap on the plain," the so-called "becoming famous overnight throughout the world," are all realistic slogans. How could it succeed so much? Then there are subtle technical applications at work.

The county exam, the provincial exam, and the metropolitan exam each had several rounds, and if one failed in one exam, one took it again. Often one would be tested until one's hair turned white and one's face became wrinkled, one's brush became blunt and one's ink dried up, not knowing how many questions one had gone through, how many words one had written, but the most important thing was the eight-legged essay. The topics of the first round came from the Four Books, and the scriptures and policy questions in the second and third rounds were just embellishments. The examiners mostly chose based on the Four Books essays, so the scholars at that time often said, "The three rounds are led by the first, the first is led by the first essay, and the first essay is led by the first eight lines." The senior gentlemen who were the examiners had developed this way when they took the exams, and once they were examiners, they also used this method to select scholars. This tradition had been going on for hundreds of years. Therefore, scholars in "cold windows" first had to carefully study and practice the Four Books and Zhu's annotations, as well as the model examination essays and test poem of their predecessors. Next were the Five Classics, and then books on history and geography were used for reference. Each province and each examination was the same, with a uniform pattern. Acquiring or borrowing these materials was not difficult, far from the heavy tuition fees of later schools. Compared with school enrollment, there were a few popular sayings in the early years of the Republic of China: "The children of the minister, president, prime minister, and bank CEO are PhDs who study abroad; the children of high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants are university students; the children of ordinary officials and merchants graduate from middle and elementary schools; poor children have no books to read." It was also said, "A degree is for the aristocracy." This was inevitable, and there was no denying it. But in the scientific era, this problem did not exist. The few books and articles prepared by the poor and impoverished were the same as the few books and articles needed by the rich and wealthy. Even if they had the ability to provide their younger siblings with a great academic education to become old PhDs, they would still be "useless in the imperial examination field" and would be in an equal opportunity with those from cold windows to win a place on the list.

Because high officials and the senior members of the Hanlin Academy were accustomed to speculation and able to communicate their intentions, they also established a "official paper" restriction, that is, for the children of high officials or members of the Hanlin Academy, the number of examinees was first checked for each exam, and a certain quota was set. If the quota was exceeded, they were not allowed to be selected, and they were not allowed to be included in the top eighteen candidates, to prevent people from powerful families from taking advantage of their superior positions and hindering the career paths of impoverished scholars. As for the enforcement of the law against those who cheated (in the Shunzhi and Xianfeng dynasties, there were major imperial examination cases, and the chief examiners were beheaded or exiled), the chief examiners cherished their reputations, valued literary talent, and adhered to the principle of impartiality, hoping to establish literary and moral connections, and mostly did not accept bribes and were not greedy. With legal sanctions above and mental satisfaction in their hearts, although cheating in the imperial examination could not be completely eliminated in practice, the impression of "impartiality" and "uprightness" was extremely deep and widespread, and it could grasp the hearts of the people nationwide and concentrate their faith, which was by no means accidental.

The social significance is as described above. However, from the perspective of academic culture, it was completely outdated. In addition to stereotypical essays, calligraphy, and poetry, some things about history and geography were not clear. Even in the era of seclusion, it was not enough. (Among them, those who excelled in economics and politics and established fame, such as Zeng and Li, were due to their individual talents and application, and not due to the power of the imperial examination's eight-legged essay and small regular script.) What about the trend of the world's cultural progress? It was certainly a "relic." The reason why I describe it in detail is that, firstly, this kind of spirit of "equality" and system is an important record in history; and secondly, the current mechanism for selecting officials, has some connection with the imperial examination and is of reference value. As for the current examination, it is based on school education and aims at genuine talent and practical learning. The reporter also has many years of experience in school life and school examinations, and will discuss them in another article.
