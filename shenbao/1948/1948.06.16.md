### Wen Wenhao Answers Legislator Inquiries, Explains Military, Financial, and Diplomatic Principles, Specific Questions to Be Answered Individually in Writing

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Premier Wen Wenhao of the Executive Yuan, in the 12th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th, gave an oral address as a general reply to the inquiries from various members regarding the administrative policies during the 9th, 10th, and 11th meetings of the Yuan. Mr. Wen first expressed his gratitude for the corrections made by the members and resolved to make every effort to pay attention to the improvement and effective implementation of the administrative policies. He also declared twice at the beginning and end of his reply that this general reply was decided after consultation with the heads of various ministries and commissions, focusing on the interpretation of major principles. Specific questions will be answered individually in writing successively. He stated that the administrative policy was the direction of administration formulated at the beginning of the constitutional government's Executive Yuan taking office, and the details of the plan will be submitted in the budget.

### Improve Treatment, Intensify Training, Clarify the Conscription Policy, Implementing Both Conscription and Recruitment, the Organizational Law of the Ministry of National Defense Is Under Revision

Military aspect: 1. How to establish a national defense military system, the organizational law of the Ministry of National Defense is under study and revision, and once the drafting is completed, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan. However, during the period of suppressing the rebellion, military actions are extremely important. This matter has been approved by the President. The basic principles of the revised organization of the Ministry of National Defense stipulate that "The Minister of National Defense is responsible for military policy and administrative responsibilities, and the Chief of General Staff is the chief of staff of the commander-in-chief and the administrative officer of the Minister of National Defense, responsible for the planning and guidance of military affairs." "The Chief of General Staff shall execute military orders according to the President's orders, and execute military administration according to the Minister's orders, or according to the Minister's instructions."

2. How to enhance the combat power of North China and Central China, (1) Unite the people, boost morale, command properly, intensify training, and replenish equipment. (2) Improve treatment, clarify rewards and punishments, and provide sufficient supplies to outstanding troops. (3) Allocate weapons and ammunition and intensify training to support the establishment and strengthening of local armed forces. 3. How to supplement manpower and prepare military rations, in order to cope with the increasingly expanding communist bandits, it is necessary to conscript soldiers. However, the household registration is not clear, and the Baojia chiefs are inevitably disturbing the people. In the future, we will strengthen the organization, clarify the conscription policy, and at the same time adopt recruitment methods, implementing both conscription and recruitment to broaden the source of soldiers. We will also do our best to improve the treatment of soldiers. As for the preparation of military rations, which requires 40 million dan per year, in order to avoid increasing issuance by purchasing, we can only continue to levy grain. The Grain Department is actively urging its subordinates to eliminate malpractices.

### Reform of the Monetary System to Draft a Plan, State-Owned Enterprises Issue Stocks, Diplomatic Efforts to Urge the Soviet Union to Fulfill the Treaty

Financial and Economic Aspects: During the period of suppressing the rebellion, military expenditure is huge. The ordinary budget can be expected to be balanced, but the special budget is bound to be insufficient. In order to increase financial resources, in addition to requesting the Legislative Yuan to assist in increasing tax revenue, a part of state-owned enterprises will be sold to increase revenue. The reform of the monetary system involves too much. We will do our best to formulate proper measures. In the shortest period, responsible authorities will invite experts to complete research and preparation, and formulate a plan to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for a secret meeting to discuss the implementation. The methods of stabilizing prices by selling materials and tightening issuance in the past will continue. At the same time, issuing stocks of state-owned enterprises, circulating US aid materials, issuing treasury bonds, increasing production, and strengthening exports will all be used to stabilize the lives of the people in the rear.

Diplomatic aspect: The Sino-Soviet border is extremely long and the relationship is very important. Although we paid a great price for the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union also bears many obligations. If we faithfully abide by it, the Soviet Union must also fulfill its obligations. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet relationship still needs to be improved. It is not a mistake of the treaty, but a failure to fulfill it. I have repeatedly negotiated and protested against the Soviet Union's failure to fulfill the treaty. In the future, I will continue to adhere to my position and continue to seek a solution, and will never humiliate the country. As for the Japanese issue, our policy is to prevent the revival of Japanese aggression and to prevent Japan from becoming communist. This is the same position as the United States. Regarding the request for compensation, the Executive Yuan has a Compensation Committee responsible for the details. The detailed compensation plan has been handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct representatives in Tokyo and Washington to implement it effectively, and has never been neglected.

Mr. Wen admitted the bad phenomena pointed out by the members, such as the political atmosphere being too dull and the efficiency being too poor, and explained that the reason was that too much was involved in employing people. However, he has the confidence to serve the country with loyalty. Although there are many difficulties, he lacks the corresponding necessary ability, and he is determined to work hard to break the current situation, and hopes that the Legislative Yuan will provide support in terms of legal system and facts, concentrate efforts under the great goal of suppressing the rebellion, and complete the task. Finally, he sincerely stated that he had no intention of advocating high theories when formulating the administrative policy, and will formulate a schedule and implement it in order. He also hopes that the members will give more advice and work together to shoulder the difficult task.

Of the 3 trillion yuan of tax revenue, commodity tax is still the first, increasing tenfold compared to the budget for the first half of this year, totaling 1 trillion yuan. Customs duty is second, totaling over 700 billion yuan. The budgets for other taxes have also increased eight to ten times compared to the budget for the first half of this year. Among them, the stamp tax budget has increased the most compared to the budget for the first half of this year, being twelve times higher. The budget for direct taxes has also reached over 400 billion yuan. The figures for this tax revenue budget were individually negotiated by Wang Yunwu with the heads of various tax agencies. Although it is still unknown whether the expectations can be met in reality, Wang Yunwu has repeatedly encouraged the heads of various tax agencies to strive to achieve the figures listed in the budget.

It is also learned that the Ministry of Finance will improve the tax rates for various taxes. The tax rates for customs and salt taxes will be adjusted. At the same time, the procedures for collection will also be simplified and improved as much as possible. The Executive Yuan is satisfied with the revenue budget for the second half of the year listed by the Ministry of Finance and hopes that it can be effectively implemented. As for the expenditure budget, it is being prepared by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and its amount still exceeds the total of the revenue budget.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Ministry of Finance held a ministry meeting at 3 pm on the 15th. All Vice Ministers, Directors-General, and Directors attended. Wang Yunwu delivered a speech, encouraging the increase of tax revenue and hoping that all colleagues would be responsible at each level and fulfill their duties. It was rumored that Wang Yunwu had submitted his resignation, but relevant parties pointed out on the 15th that this was not true.

### Principal Financial Officials Must Report Private Property Before and After Taking Office. The Legislative Yuan Resolves to Refer the Original Proposal to the Committee for Review. Another Twenty-One Members are Appointed to Review the Plan to Save the Nation from Crisis.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The 12th meeting of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 15th, chaired by Sun Ke. The meeting opened at 9:10 am, passed the minutes of the previous meeting, and decided to refer the government proposals submitted by the National Government's Legislative Yuan to various committees for review. Then, the Executive Yuan Premier Wen gave a reply to the inquiries from the legislators regarding the administrative policies. At 10:15 am, Mr. Wen concluded his half-hour speech amid applause and withdrew with the heads of various ministries and commissions. The Legislative Yuan then began the discussion of the agenda. The cases handled throughout the day are as follows: (1) Zhao Huimo and others proposed to request the Executive Yuan to strictly order principal financial officials to report their private property. The resolution was to refer it to the committee for review. (2) Huang Jianzhong and others proposed to amend the articles of the Legislative Yuan's organizational law and the organizational laws of the Legislative Yuan's various committees to revise the provisions regarding the hiring or appointment of specialists and staff. The resolution was to retain it. (3) Hu Qiuyuan and others proposed to form a special committee to review the gains and losses of the country's governance since the victory, in order to prepare for reforms and save the nation from crisis. The resolution was to appoint one person from each of the twenty-one committees to conduct a joint review, formulate measures, and then submit them to the Yuan meeting for discussion. The afternoon meeting ended at 6 pm.

The measures listed in the proposal to request the Executive Yuan to order principal financial officials to report their private property are that the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank must truthfully report the amount of their personal property when taking office and leaving office, and strictly prohibit relatives within two degrees of kinship from engaging in related businesses during their tenure. Those who have served in these two positions during the National Government period are also required to report the amount of property before June 20th of this year and attach an explanation. During the discussion of this case, only one or two people spoke out against it. The majority of opinions also advocated expanding its scope to all military and political leaders in various Yuan, ministries, commissions, and local areas.

### Sun Ke Requests Attention to the Speed of Handling Cases

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Since the establishment and opening of the Legislative Yuan, the progress has been very slow. Only three cases were handled throughout the day on the 15th. President Sun therefore asked the members to pay attention to efficiency at the end of the meeting on the 15th, saying that if the meeting is conducted at a speed of one case every two hours, there is no hope of a recess this summer, and it also affects the administrative side. Many cases have value for establishment and should be submitted for review. It is best to express less opinions before the review and leave them for discussion in the review committee to avoid delaying the Yuan meeting. Finally, it was decided that in the future, when each case is first brought up for discussion, the proposer will explain the reasons first, then the opponents will speak, and then the supporters will respond, in order to facilitate the meeting.

### US Spokesman in Tokyo Responds to Protests from All Sectors in Shanghai

[American News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] A spokesman for the US political advisor to Japan issued a public statement today, stating that the protest statement recently signed by 288 leaders from industrial, commercial, educational, and other sectors in Shanghai regarding the occupation of Japan is based on distorted facts. The spokesman's statement clarified the most important points raised in the protest letter from all sectors in Shanghai.

We believe that if the signatories of the anti-American "protest letter" were aware of the true facts, they would not condemn the American authorities in Tokyo for neglecting to maintain full control over Japan to ensure that it could not engage in military aggression.

### Regulations for Exercising Supervisory Power, the Control Yuan Will Discuss and Formulate Them at the Third Meeting Today, the Meeting Regulations Were Amended and Passed in Full

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The third meeting of the Control Yuan is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 16th to discuss the formulation of regulations for exercising supervisory power, the organizational law of various committees, and the organizational regulations of the Control Yuan's administrative office.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The second meeting of the Control Yuan was held at 9:30 am on the 15th, chaired by President Yu. First, the secretariat read the minutes of the first meeting and the three telegrams of respect and condolence from the general assembly to the national soldiers suppressing the rebellion, the refugees in various regions, and the overseas Chinese. Then, the draft meeting rules of the Control Yuan were discussed, and the chairman of the review committee, Zhang Weihan, explained the review process. Committee member Tang Honglie advocated discussing them chapter by chapter in order to be quick and have a focus, which was unanimously agreed. The first chapter, general principles, was discussed first. Many people expressed their opinions, but the opinions were concentrated on Article 3 (which was Article 4 in the discussion on the 14th, now adjusted to Article 3). In the article, divided into several points, one is the Yuan meeting time, one is the number of attendees, one is the difference between the plenary meeting (also the annual meeting) and the monthly meeting, etc. After more than two hours of discussion, at 11:50 am, someone proposed to ask the chairman to summarize the opinions and submit them for a vote. After a vote, there were no changes to the text of Article 3 except for the deletion of eight characters. After extending the time, the first chapter was voted on article by article, and when it came to Article 3, someone proposed that a provision for "closed meetings" should be added. Many people agreed, but in the end it was considered that it could be included in Chapter 4, "Meetings". Then, the discussion continued, and all ten articles of the first chapter were passed without dissent. The text of the third article as amended and passed is recorded as follows: "The meetings of this Yuan shall be held once a month, and shall not be held unless one-fifth or more of all Control Yuan members are present. A decision shall be made with the consent of more than half of those present, but the meeting in March each year shall be a general annual review, and must have the attendance of more than half of all members."

The meeting continued at 3:30 pm, and the meeting rules were discussed chapter by chapter. By about 6 pm, the entire case had been passed. The afternoon meeting was still chaired by President Yu, and at 4:45 pm, Mr. Yu left in advance, and Deputy President Liu continued to preside over the meeting. The more heated discussion in the meeting was also the most important part of the whole case, about the following points: (1) In Chapter 4 (Meetings), add a clause for closed meetings. Liu added Article 20 after Article 19, the text of which is: "The meetings of this Yuan shall be open, and when necessary, on the proposal of the chairman or the attending members, and with the consent of the attending members after consulting the chairman, it may be announced that the meeting will be changed to a closed meeting." (2) Chapter 7 (Exercise of the Power of Consent) was discussed for a long time, and there were many opinions. Some people believed that a provision for the consent power review committee should be added separately. For a time, speakers were very enthusiastic, but when it was put to a vote, it ultimately failed to pass due to the small number of votes. Only Article 40 (the original Article 39) was slightly amended, and its text is: "The exercise of the power of consent shall have the attendance of more than half of all Control Yuan members, and its resolution shall adopt a secret ballot method." (3) The chapter name of Chapter 8 was changed from "Minutes of Meeting" to "Meeting Minutes". (4) In Article 46 (the original Article 45) in Chapter 9 (Order), most people expressed dissatisfaction with the words "warning to stop" and changed it to "reminding them to pay attention." The rest were passed without dissent, and the meeting adjourned at 6 pm.

### Bandits Withdraw from the Periphery of Changchun, Claiming That the Cost of Attacking Changchun Is Too High, So They Transfer Their Forces

[This newspaper, Fanyang, 15th] The bandits on the periphery of Changchun withdrew on the 14th in separate routes. The bandit's Independent 7th, 8th, and 9th Divisions fled back to Kalun, Yinma River, and Ponizi in the east of Changchun. A part of the Independent 10th Division retreated to Datun in the southwest of Changchun. The 6th Column retreated to the Changchun Fort, Hengtoushanzi, and Danantun area in the south of Changchun. A part of the 1st Column retreated to the west of the Dafangshen Airport. The reason for the bandits' withdrawal is that there is insufficient food and ammunition, and the supply is difficult. However, it has not yet been determined whether it is a feigned retreat. However, more than a thousand bandits raided the Green Park in the urban area of Changchun on the night of the 14th, and fierce battles were still raging until the morning of the 15th.

Editorial

### Starting with the Difficulties of the Machine Industry

At the beginning of the foreign exchange reform, the authorities were rumored to have a plan to largely or completely liberalize the import of production equipment, allowing it to be purchased with self-provided foreign exchange. This newspaper once wrote an article praising this idea. This is because such equipment is the mother of all industries. Some imported machinery cannot be used because accessories are difficult to obtain, while some machinery that has already been ordered is being used as an excuse to set up factories and start production in Hong Kong. In order to protect national industry and promote domestic production, it is only reasonable to encourage the import of production equipment.

However, amidst the shortage of production equipment and the calls for welcoming foreign goods, there is also a contradictory phenomenon that must be given serious attention, namely, the machine industry in this city is on the verge of extinction. It is said that there are about 900 factories in this industry, large and small, with 20,000 machine tools and about 60,000 workers. Due to the decline of industry, especially the contraction or relocation of the textile industry, their manufactured goods are selling poorly, and there is too much inventory, resulting in a very difficult situation. This can be explained by the following reasons:

(1) The so-called production equipment is limited in variety. Some departments cannot manufacture domestically and have to purchase foreign goods, while at the same time, other departments are experiencing overproduction for the reasons mentioned above.

(2) The accessories for originally imported machines cannot be supplied domestically and still need to be sourced from abroad.

(3) There is a class of manufacturers who trust foreign machines far more than domestic products, preferring to buy foreign goods rather than domestic ones.

We believe that the above two points, (1) and (2), are easily solvable factual problems. Apart from allowing the machine industry to gradually improve over time and find ways to solve them, the state should earnestly promote domestically produced finished products that can now be substituted, expand their sales, and alleviate their current difficulties. This will also help cultivate this unique basic industry in the country. The methods are: 1. State-owned factories should give priority to using domestic goods to promote them; 2. When applying for the import of production equipment, any domestic products that can be substituted should be strictly reviewed and rejected; 3. Private factories should be persuaded to use domestic goods.

In the past, there was a vehicle manufacturer whose products were quite excellent. Although they were gradually adopted by officials and merchants, it is said that the process of persuading them to purchase and try them was very difficult and painful. Last year, domestically produced locomotives in a certain area were finally manufactured with great difficulty, but it seems that no one paid attention to them. Looking at these kinds of examples, it can be seen that the development of the machine industry in its infancy is indeed not easy. However, at this time when finished products are stagnating and unable to be maintained, everyone should think further ahead and jointly maintain this fragile foundation in order to develop domestic products, reduce unemployment, and reduce the waste of foreign exchange funds.

It is said that since the victory, the industry's output has mostly been supplied to the textile industry. In March of this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs convened a textile machinery manufacturing meeting, which originally had a plan to manufacture 200,000 spindles and 7,000 looms within a year and a half. It is hoped that this plan can be effectively promoted. At the same time, the Textile Control Commission should change its focus to increasing production and not tie itself up, making manufacturers shy away. In this way, not only will the difficulties of the machine industry be easily resolved, but the prospects of the textile industry will also be easily restored to their original prosperity. It is said that there is now a proposal to reform the Textile Control Commission. We believe that simply changing the organization, changing the name, and moving personnel will not have much effect. It is better to change the policy and focus on increasing production. Genuinely helping manufacturers to solve their difficulties and not simply increasing their burdens is somewhat in line with Premier Weng's policy statement on strengthening production, using the most effective solutions, and stabilizing prices.

Premier Weng also mentioned hoarding and evading capital, and the government is discussing countermeasures, which is naturally something everyone eagerly hopes for. However, in terms of production equipment, one aspect is that there is too much inventory and it cannot be sold, while another aspect is that factories are relocating to the south to purchase foreign equipment, allowing a large amount of capital to flow abroad. In this regard, we must appeal to the government to promptly implement the above-mentioned remedial measures to cooperate with the current national policy.

Premier Weng is very concerned about the danger of inflation, believing that if the national treasury cannot increase its income, it will inevitably issue more currency, and the market will collapse. It seems that there is a chance to stop inflation in the future. This is naturally something everyone is happy to hear. But I don't know if he has fundamentally changed his loan policy. If he still follows the old habits and starts with ordering and purchasing goods, then we ask that domestically produced equipment that is unsalable and closely related to the national economy should at least be considered in the same way as daily necessities. Do not abandon it simply because it is not profitable at the moment. Because the purpose of state-owned banks in providing loans is originally to increase production and support industry, and they should not only aim at making profits by disguising hoarding. Since production equipment is the foundation of all industries, and the loans it needs are larger and longer in duration, if state-owned banks do not come out to support it, the industry may collapse completely. If state-owned banks turn a blind eye to the crisis in the machine industry, it may not be an appropriate measure that "takes the interests of the people as its own interests"!

### Penicillin Switched; Distilled Water Kills Sick Child; Careless Loss of Life at Wuxian Public Hospital; Family Insists on Refusing to Collect the Body

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 15th] The Wuxian Public Hospital has been established for more than a year. Thanks to the enthusiastic donations from local gentry Yan Xinqi and others, the equipment is complete, and it has long been known as the best in the counties along the Shanghai-Nanjing line. However, recently, due to a case of switching medicines for hospitalized patients, local people have been gossiping, and the hospital's reputation has been greatly reduced. On April 17, a military officer Zhao, whose son Lianming, four years old, suffered from epidemic meningitis, came to the hospital for treatment. Although the hospital had no isolation ward, it rashly admitted him and instructed Zhao to purchase penicillin solution himself and hand it over to the hospital for daily injection. However, the illness did not subside. Zhao suddenly discovered that the medicine had been switched. On May 1, he secretly marked the medicine bottle, which confirmed that the medicine bottle had been switched. After asking a doctor to determine that it was distilled water, Zhao questioned the hospital. After repeated negotiations, the hospital pointed out that the person responsible was the head nurse Xu Meiyu, who was dismissed after writing a letter of repentance and secretly sent to the Wudi Inspection Office for investigation and detention. Zhao's son died on the 6th of this month, and his family refused to collect the body. The hospital purchased a nanmu coffin and reported it to the Inspection Office for inspection before directly collecting and storing it in the funeral home. The family still refuses to collect it. All parties concerned are tight-lipped about the truth of the case. The hospital's board of directors once planned to convene a meeting of directors to discuss the solution, but because the directors were pessimistic about the future of the hospital, both meetings were adjourned. Various sectors of society have criticized the responsibility of hospital director Zou Sitai and are closely watching the Inspection Office's handling of the case.

### Pay for Officers and Soldiers Issued in Three Installments According to One-Third of Cost of Living Adjustment

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] After the salaries of officers and soldiers nationwide are adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index, they must be issued in three installments, which easily causes misunderstandings among the troops who do not know the truth. According to the relevant authorities of the Logistics Command: The cost of living index can only be calculated after the Executive Yuan approves it in the middle and late part of the month. Therefore, the next month's funding for various military units cannot be fully issued in one go. However, in order to take into account the actual needs, it is issued in installments. For example, the funding for July is first pre-issued in early June according to the amount given in May.

### The Mystery of Yang Mei Remains Unsolved; Yang Sen Declares He Will Not Stop Testing; States She Has Become a Research Subject for Scientists Worldwide

[This Newspaper's Chongqing Dispatch, 15th] Mayor Yang Sen firmly believes that Yang Mei does not eat. According to his original plan, he intended to send medical personnel to accompany Yang Mei back to her original home in E'du to continue the examination and to conduct in-depth research on the environment of Yang Mei's origin, such as grass and water. He deeply feels that Yang Mei's special physiological structure may affect her lifespan, so finding a suitable place for Yang Mei's residence is the most important condition before research. Later, due to the unrest in E'du and Shizhu, he feared robbery by gangsters or accidents, which has delayed the plan until now. Yang Mei now lives in Chongqing, and he has an inescapable duty to be Yang Mei's guardian. Outsiders do not understand the truth and speculate a lot. His daughter, Yang Wanyun, who is currently studying at Jindai University in Beijing, recently wrote a letter from Beijing saying, "Dear Dad, the Beijing newspapers often talk about your opinions on Yang Mei, some of which are not very good, of course. I hope you can be a little careful to avoid unfounded satire. But I'm not very clear about what's going on with Yang Mei. I hope you can tell me something." Yang described this with witty remarks, fully revealing his soldier's forthright and frank personality. Because Yang Mei is a woman, he is determined to study the mystery of her not eating to the end. His wife also advised him that he could not finish managing national affairs, so why bother with this? However, if the mystery of Yang Mei is not solved one day, he will never give up. He also expressed dissatisfaction with Zhuo Songdai's strange attitude towards Yang Mei. He once accompanied his wife to visit Yang Mei. Yang Mei reported to him in person that she wanted to go home. When asked why, she replied that after returning home, she could sell a chicken and a pig to buy cloth to sew clothes. Although Yang Mei does not eat, she still has the feminine nature of loving beauty and likes daily cosmetics such as floral fabrics, lipstick, powder, and leather shoes. He immediately advised her not to worry, that his wife could send her everything. But Che Songdai showed displeasure nearby. It is clear that Zhuo does not want any organization to have close contact with Yang Mei. Yang also solemnly told this newspaper reporter: He has the responsibility to uncover the mystery of Yang Mei's not eating, and will start to move Yang Mei from Zhuo's residence in Jiulongpo to an ideal location suitable for Yang Mei's living environment within days. Yang's sole research with this newspaper reporter resulted in the most suitable place being the Shantung Forest Garden in the suburbs of the city. There is Yue River there, allowing Yang Mei to enjoy the mountains and rivers, wear cloth clothes, and go barefoot without any restraint, as she likes. The house is also spacious enough to accommodate experts and researchers. In addition, the location is remote, so even if Yang Mei wants to buy something to eat, it is impossible. However, the so-called guardians such as Zhang Lao Tai Tai and Ran Xiao Jie are refused to accompany her. Yang Mei is already familiar with and has a good impression of female police officers and nurses. With their accompaniment, loneliness can be reduced, otherwise loopholes are inevitable and people will still be suspicious. Yang emphasized that Yang Mei can no longer be privately owned by any individual. She has become a research subject for scientists all over the world, so the city government has the responsibility to protect her and will never allow any examination that would harm Yang Mei's body and mind. According to Hu Xianwen, the dean of Zhongzheng Hospital, although the technical committee for studying Yang Mei has not actively carried out its work, he has close contact with the heads of various hospitals in Chongqing and is fully prepared for the next step of clinical examination of Yang Mei. They welcome American experts Glaci and Roth to Chongqing, but before they arrive in Chongqing, Chongqing medical scientists should at least have a preliminary research result, such as chemical analysis of blood and urine, and various examinations of bacterial physiology, as a reference for further in-depth research by Chinese and foreign experts. Therefore, it is believed that it is the best measure to first move Yang Mei to Zhuo's residence in Jiulongpo in terms of the environment. The technical committee will hold a meeting within days to discuss the steps in detail. Once Yang Sen instructs the Bureau of Health, Yang Mei's next step of examination can be made more thorough by breaking away from the shackles of her previous guardian.

Whether the congressmen have achievements in this, the last week of the 80th Congress, will have a significant impact on the 1948 political campaign. President Truman has repeatedly criticized what he calls "the second worst Congress in history." In his speech in Los Angeles, he asked members of Congress to continue to meet until the price control bill and the housing bill were resolved, but Republican leaders are proceeding with their own plans to adjourn on June 19. The dynamics of the Senate and House of Representatives are listed below:

(1) The House Rules Committee reluctantly passed the conscription bill for young people aged 19 to 25 and submitted it to the House. In fact, the passage of this bill before the House adjourns has already been decided. The Senate has already passed a similar bill.

(2) The Senate passed and returned to the House a bill extending the reciprocal trade agreement for one year. The bill places some restrictions on President Truman's power to reduce tariffs. The House previously passed a bill giving Congress the power to veto tariffs and is expected to accept the Senate's opinion.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The United States took action on the 14th to strengthen its air force and maintain its mission in a better world geared towards national defense.

Funds for the expansion of the air force have already been allocated, and the bill will provide for the establishment of an air force of seventy regular groups, with a total of 502,000 service personnel. President Truman has just signed a bill for new construction for the Army and Air Force, which stipulates that the Army ground forces may use 3,803,000 yuan for housing and other facilities on the Mariana Islands, and the Air Force may use 5,376,000 US dollars for barracks and other facilities. In addition, another 3,690,000 yuan was allocated to improve the US military camps in the Philippines.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] The Senate Appropriations Committee approved 3,812,000,000 US dollars for the Navy's expenses in the next fiscal year, which is an increase of 125 million US dollars compared to the amount approved by the House of Representatives.

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Army Secretary Royal and Chief of Staff Bradley today urged the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee to restore 492 million yuan of the 600 million yuan cut by the House of Representatives from the Army's budget. Bradley emphasized that today's world situation requires an expansion plan, and appropriate national defense is still the best guarantee for survival under peaceful conditions.

[U.S. New Development Office, Washington, 14th] Congress today overrode the President's veto and, by a more than two-thirds vote, enacted legislation amending the U.S. Social Security System. This new law increases relief funds for the elderly, blind, and dependent children in each state, while at the same time depriving a considerable number of groups, including salespeople, truck drivers, and traveling car drivers, of the right to old-age pensions. The override of the President's veto was first taken by the House of Representatives with a vote of 297 to 75, followed by the Senate's vote of 65 to 13, thus causing both houses to enact legislation by a more than two-thirds majority, regardless of the President's veto.

### Frontline in Palestine is Quiet; Mediation Work is in Progress; Arab Suggestions Will Hardly Be Accepted by the Jewish Side

[This newspaper's news] London, 15th Broadcast: Bernadotte arrived in Cairo today to explore the possibility of a permanent ceasefire in Palestine with Arab leaders. It is said that although both sides have slightly violated the ceasefire, this is an inevitable phenomenon at the beginning.

[United Press, Cairo, 15th] The six-and-a-half-month war in Palestine saw complete silence on all fronts for the first time yesterday. The United Nations mediation team is stepping up its efforts to promote a lasting peace between the Arab and Jewish sides during the four-week truce. Mediator Bernadotte has completed his deployment on Rott Island and flew to Cairo today to meet with Arab leaders on peace talks, and then flew to Tel Aviv on the 17th to meet with Israeli authorities. At the same time, political and military leaders of Arab countries gathered in Cairo this morning to decide on a policy to deal with the peace talks. The first thing that Berne needs to decide is whether the Arab and Jewish sides are willing to hold a roundtable meeting on Rott Island. As of now, neither side has changed its attitude.

[Reuters, Cairo, 15th] Highly reliable sources here claim that in the future peace negotiations on Palestine, the Arab side will suggest imitating the Swiss federal system and establishing a federation in Palestine composed of several regions enjoying great autonomy, with each state sending representatives to the central committee. This central committee will be controlled by the Arab ethnic group, and the federal foreign affairs will be handled by the central committee. It is expected that the Arab side's suggestion will hardly be accepted by the Jewish side, because the Jewish side has previously clearly stated that it will never accept any suggestion that does not allow it to enjoy full national sovereignty.

### Before the Soviet Union Has Peaceful Sincerity; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Will Not Be Convened

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office declared that the government had no knowledge of Marshall's proposal to convene a new meeting of the four-power foreign ministers. Well-informed sources emphasized that this meeting would never be convened, because the U.S. authorities recently stated that unless the Soviet Union has concrete guarantees to prove that the meeting is constructive, it should not hold talks with Moscow again.

[United Press, London, 15th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said on the 15th that Britain and the United States had reached a tacit agreement that they must consult with each other before deciding on actions in the Middle East. "Both sides clearly understand that any action by one group immediately affects the other country."

[United Press, Haifa, 15th] British officials announced on the 15th that all British troops would withdraw from Palestine within the next ten days. The United Kingdom is now accelerating its withdrawal.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The current position of the United Kingdom is to maintain a detached position and let Bernadotte find a solution to the Arab-Jewish question. Diplomatic observers here believe that the main difficulty in holding peace talks between the Jews and Arabs will be the question of the existence of the State of Israel.

Abdullah has accepted Ibn Saud's invitation. This is the first visit by a member of the Hashemite royal family of Jordan to Saudi Arabia in 20 years. The two royal families have not interacted since Saudi Arabia took over the Hajjat area controlled by the Hashemites within Saudi Arabia 20 years ago. The meeting between the two kings will be the prelude to rebuilding the friendship between the two countries, and also an important step for Arab countries to abandon their past suspicions and strengthen their unity against external forces.

### Blockade of the Holy Land Coastline; Egypt and Syria Reject U.S. Protests

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 14th] The Arab League blockaded the coastline of Palestine, and the U.S. lodged a protest. According to McDermott, the press liaison officer of the U.S. Department of State, Egypt and Syria have replied to the U.S. and rejected the U.S. protest. The U.S. government believes that since the other side has not formally declared war, the blockade is unnecessary. Currently, U.S. ships are not evading this blockade line.

### Burma Tends to Be Pro-Communist; Britain Expresses Deep Concern

[Reuters, London, 15th] Burmese Prime Minister Tejkin Nohyesterday delivered a speech that would make Burma Sovietized. The British government does not intend to make any formal statement until it has obtained accurate reports from its embassy in Burma. However, non-official people have expressed extreme concern over this drastic change in Burma. Observers believe that Tejkin Noh's speech may be related to the recent increasingly active communist activities in central Burma and the Malay Peninsula. At the same time, it also shows that while Western powers are focusing all their attention on Western Europe, the Far East Communist Information Bureau has made considerable progress under its hard work.

### Municipal Government Rice Price Review Meeting Decides; Rice Price Controls to Be Restored Today; White Rice May Exceed 10 Million Per Stone

Rice prices have been soaring for days. Mayor Wu Guoguo and Committee Chairman Ren Zhuwei Xianqun, in order to completely eliminate the rise and stabilize grain prices, specially convened relevant parties at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 5:00 p.m. on the 15th to hold a rice price review meeting. After careful study by all parties, it was unanimously agreed that rice prices cannot be allowed to soar out of control and that it is necessary to impose restrictions. Therefore, it was finally decided that starting from the 16th, the price control method would be adopted as before, and the price of top-quality white rice should not exceed 10 million yuan per stone. If there are any cases of exceeding the price limit after the implementation of the price control method in rice shops in this city, citizens can report them as much as possible or refuse to purchase. When selling rice, rice shops must also record the names and addresses of citizens who purchase rice in detail to prevent multiple purchases and hoarding, and to facilitate spot checks by the competent authorities. It is reported that Mayor Wu immediately notified the People's Food Allocation Committee and the Police Bureau of this method after the meeting. If rice shops violate the rules, in addition to the police station being responsible for sending them to court for legal processing, the People's Food Allocation Committee may also revoke their rice allocation qualifications.

### People's Food Allocation Committee Dispatches 100 People Today; To Cooperate with Economic Police to Enforce Price Controls

Committee Chairman Ren of the People's Food Allocation Committee also made a statement to reporters after the meeting, saying: The actual rice consumption of this city is 640,000 stones, and the current allocation volume is 500,000 stones, a difference of 140,000 stones. The government has decided to supply half of this shortfall, which is 70,000 stones, and the rest will be supplied by rice merchants. The rice supplied by the government will be sold every other day, 6,000 stones each time, at a price of 9.2 million yuan per stone. The rice supplied by the market will be limited to 9.8 million yuan, so the maximum price limit must not exceed 10 million yuan. Finally, Ren also stated: The People's Food Allocation Committee is still affiliated to the Municipal Government, and the rumor that it will be transferred to the Ministry of Food is not true. He himself has dispelled his intention to resign and is determined to take on this difficult task again. There will be absolutely no problems with the supply of allocated rice in Shanghai in the future. The selling price of household rice will also be rationalized and will not be calculated based on 95% of the market price. Ren also emphasized that the price limit of 10 million yuan per stone is officially announced by the Municipal Government and will be strictly enforced. The People's Food Allocation Committee has decided to dispatch 100 people starting from the 16th to cooperate with the economic police to thoroughly investigate rice shops and strictly enforce price controls.

### Fuel Supply Cut Off; Hai Sui Steamer Suspended; More Ships Will Be Unable to Set Sail Today and Tomorrow

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Sui steamer, originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Xiamen at noon on the 15th, was unable to depart due to a lack of fuel, causing passengers to complain. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the bureau had long felt the difficulty in fuel supply. Several months ago, it had repeatedly petitioned the higher authorities for assistance in resolving the issue. On April 24, the Executive Yuan specifically convened a meeting in Beijing for this purpose, resolving that the Diesel Allocation Committee of the Import and Export Management Committee would allocate 9,000 tons of diesel to the bureau every month starting from May. However, after repeated consultations and urgings, the Diesel Allocation Committee has not yet complied with the order to allocate the fuel. Recently, the Mei Foo Oil Company specially sold 5,000 tons of diesel to the bureau to meet the urgent need, and an application was made to the Central Bank for foreign exchange settlement. However, the application procedure was quite complicated, and it was not until the afternoon of the 11th of this month that the Central Bank allowed the foreign exchange settlement. However, since the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method on June 1, the bureau's fuel consumption also requires a foreign exchange settlement certificate before it can be settled with the Central Bank. However, the acquisition of foreign exchange settlement certificates is quite difficult, so it has not yet been completed, causing the Hai Sui steamer to be unable to depart. The Linsen, Haikang, Haiyue, Xilin, Hai'e, Haidian, and other ships will also be suspended today and tomorrow due to a lack of fuel.

### Traffic Interrupted in Xujiahui District for Seven Hours Yesterday; Ordnance Bureau Workers Caused Trouble on Bus, Destroying Vehicles and Assaulting More Than a Dozen People

[Report from Our Newspaper] Workers from the Shanghai Repair Office of the Ordnance Bureau of the United Logistics Headquarters in the city caused a conflict with employees of the Public Utilities Bureau's public buses yesterday after refusing to purchase tickets. They then gathered in the Xujiahui district to make trouble, destroying five public buses and one police car, and assaulting more than a dozen ticket sellers and drivers. When military police gathered, the workers fired machine guns and Thompson submachine guns to resist arrest. Fortunately, the targets were inaccurate, and the military police also exercised restraint and did not retaliate, avoiding a major disaster. Traffic in the area was suspended from 12:30 PM until 8:00 PM. All the injured were sent to various hospitals for emergency treatment, including two seriously injured people who may be in danger of death.

At 6:30 yesterday morning, a worker wearing blue work clothes was riding on the Route 5 public bus running between Caojiadu and Jing'an Temple. When the bus was halfway, ticket inspector No. 35, because he had not purchased a ticket, inquired with him. The worker then showed a temporary ID card from the "Ordnance Bureau of the United Logistics Headquarters." Because the ticket inspector was not a soldier, he asked him to buy a ticket, but was refused. While they were arguing, the bus stopped at the Huashan Road intersection of Jing'an Temple. At that time, a vehicle of the Ordnance Bureau was also full of workers and stopped there. The worker got off the bus and called several colleagues from the vehicle, intending to drag the ticket inspector away, causing a dispute. Within a few minutes, more public buses arrived, and the drivers and ticket sellers also gathered and reasoned with the other party. The Jing'an Temple Police Station learned of the incident and sent police to take four workers from the Ordnance Bureau to the station. After mediation, they were released, but the worker who refused to purchase the ticket, Pan Liliang, was detained by the Jing'an Temple Military Police for interrogation.

Gathering Workers to Cause Trouble on the Road

This matter could have come to an end, but the released workers were unwilling to give up. After returning to the repair office, they gathered many workers and drove a military truck loaded with stones to the vicinity of Gao'an Road at around 11:00 AM. When a Route 15 public bus with license plate number 544 approached, the workers threw stones at the bus without asking any questions. There was chaos, and the passengers fled in all directions. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured, but ticket seller No. 555 and No. 290 were injured, and driver No. 763's head was broken by a stone. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the soldiers sped away. The injured were immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

Many Ticket Sellers and Drivers Injured

At 12:30 PM, the workers escalated their actions, gathering more than a hundred people, riding in three large trucks, and driving to the vicinity of Tianyaoqiao in Xujiahui. They then got out of the truck, holding iron bars, iron cones, and other weapons, and walked to the Route 15 public bus station on Hengshan Road and the Route 5 public bus station at the entrance of Jiaotong University, destroying all five buses parked at the two locations. At the same time, they broke the heads of ticket seller Geng Weimin No. 84 and driver No. 926, seriously injuring them. They were sent to Zhongshan Hospital for emergency treatment. In addition, driver Zhang Jiyu No. 744, ticket seller Chen Xiao No. 544, and Lu Zhao'an No. 1032 were also severely beaten and injured. Ticket inspector Pang Peixiang No. 73 was thrown into the river and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Two other drivers were forcibly dragged by the perpetrators to Tianyaoqiao and boarded the truck to escape. The Jing'an Temple Military Police, the First Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters, the Xujiahui Police Station, and the Flying Fortress rushed to the scene after receiving reports, and rescued the two drivers from the truck.

Machine Gun Firing, Fortunately No Disaster Occurred

Unexpectedly, in the chaos, a police car with license plate number 133 from the Xujiahui Police Station was also destroyed. Then, when the military police chased to the vicinity of Hamannan Road and Xietu Road in Longhua, they were suddenly shot at with thirty or forty rounds from machine guns and Thompson submachine guns pre-set up by the Fourth Bureau. The military police were caught off guard and immediately lay down to hide. An officer then ordered that no retaliation was allowed. Fortunately, the other party's targets were inaccurate, and no major disaster occurred. Otherwise, the deaths and injuries would have been unimaginable. Afterwards, the workers retreated to the United Logistics Headquarters Repair Factory, the former site of the Military Governor's Office on Longhua Road.

Nineteen Workers Arrested and Handed Over

While the workers were wantonly destroying vehicles, the military police arrested the perpetrators Zhu Huitang, Hu Zhilai, Diao Guoxian, Li Weiquan, Hong Jinrong, Zhou Shaochun, Chen Jiekang, Chen Chongqing, Chen Guisheng, Li Jinpei, Feng Qiuquan, Gao Yipeng, Cai Baofu, Huang Qiulin, Feng Guozhang, Sheng Anxiang, Shou Renan, and Wang Genyin, totaling eighteen people. They are currently being detained at the Xujiahui Police Station and will be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for strict handling this morning. The main offender, Pan Liliang, was also transferred by the Jing'an Temple Military Police to the headquarters for handling together.

Decided on Four Aftermath Measures

After the incident, Wu Duo, Chief of Staff of the Port Command, Li Guochen, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ordnance Bureau of the United Logistics Headquarters, Pan Longyun, Captain of the Third Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters, Ye Qing, Captain of the Jing'an Temple Military Police, Xu Linhai, Supervisory Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, Zhang Zhen, Chief of the Xujiahui Police Station, and Wang Zongshan, Head of the Transportation Section of the Public Utilities Bureau, held a meeting to discuss the aftermath measures. It was decided that: (1) The main offenders and accomplices will be investigated and handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for strict handling; (2) The Ordnance Bureau will compensate the Public Utilities Bureau for the loss of vehicles; (3) Bear the medical expenses of the injured; (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. If there are any deaths due to injuries in this incident, another meeting will be held to discuss the matter.

This matter was finally resolved at 7:55 PM, and traffic, which had been suspended for nearly seven hours, resumed at 8:00 PM.

After investigation, the public transportation company lost 150 pieces of glass, 34.3 million yuan in ticket stubs and cash, and 50 million yuan in repair costs for the Xujiahui ticket booth.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Presidential Office, Arguing That Property Tax Bill Should Not Be Established

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Legislative Yuan's discussion of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations, cabled the Legislative Yuan, strongly stating the reasons why the tax cannot be established. Now, the Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In case of a hasty decision, it will inevitably lead to more confusion, and a motion for reconsideration should be made to show balance. Only the President can exercise the constitutional power to convey his political views in advance and properly guide the situation. With this consistent belief, the Chamber of Commerce specifically telegraphed the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office, stating the reasons why the property tax bill should not be established, and requested that it be forwarded to the President for a wise decision.

### Tongji Student Protest Case: Eight Defendants Found Not Guilty, Prosecutor Files Appeal

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Tongji student protest case, the eight defendants Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Wang Zongshu, Zhou Yongzhi, Zhang Jingyao, Sun Kema, Qu Yuping, and Wang Weixin were accused of disrupting public order. The High Court acquitted them and exempted them from punishment on the 14th of this month. Prosecutor Lin Houqi refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. The reasons are as follows: (1) Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Wang Zongshu, Sun Kema, Wang Weixin, and Zhang Jingyao: Huang and Pan were the chairmen of the Tongji student protest delegation, and the presidium was the leader of the protest team. The presidium issued orders for students to rush out of the school gate, causing the order at that time to fall into chaos. The defendants should be responsible for the crime of publicly gathering and using violence and coercion. The defendant Wang Zongshu was a member of the Standing Committee, and the defendant Wang Weixin was the commander-in-chief of the protest delegation, both of which are supported by evidence. The defendant Zhang Jingyao admitted in the police station that he held a protest flag and rushed towards the surrounding police officers and was arrested on the spot. The defendant Sun Kema crossed the ditch to beat Mayor Wu. Not only did Zhu Yifu's testimony clearly prove it, but the defendant also admitted in the police station that he was impolite to the mayor. There is no doubt that these people jointly carried out acts of violence and coercion in public. The original judgment held that they were all specific students and there was no situation of continuous increase, which did not meet the requirements for a public gathering. If that is the case, then all riots by troops or workers would not meet the requirements for a public gathering, and the legal interpretation is inappropriate. Moreover, the original judgment did not investigate whether the thousands of people who gathered were all students, and it was also based on speculation. Although their criminal behavior also violated the crime of obstructing official duties, the crime of disrupting public order cannot be abandoned. (2) Qu Yuping and Zhou Yongzhi: The investigation found that the defendant Qu Yuping was the one who beat the mayor at that time, as testified by witness Zhang Jugong on record. During the initial trial, he mistakenly identified another person as the defendant, because the time had passed for too long and his memory was unclear. The original judgment held that Zhang Jugong and the defendant were familiar with each other, and his testimony was inconsistent, so it was deemed unreliable, which was a misunderstanding. Since the defendant did beat Mayor Wu, there is no doubt that he should bear the responsibility for publicly gathering and implementing acts of violence and coercion. As for the defendant Zhou Yongzhi, witness Jiang Hong testified: "I heard that Zhou Yongzhi pushed the mayor down, which was a very proud thing to do." Combined with the testimony of witness Zhu Yifu: "Zhou Yongzhi rushed over the ditch," it is clear that he participated in the violence. Taking a step back, even if the defendant did not beat Mayor Wu, but at that time the mayor was standing by the ditch when the students were beating him in a dangerous situation, and the defendant suddenly rushed over from the thirtieth team across the ditch (see the defendant's statement), it is also clear that he had reached the degree of implementing coercion, and it is difficult to excuse him from the crime of publicly gathering and implementing acts of violence and coercion. The original judgment acquitted them all, which is inappropriate.

### Children's Sympathy: Students of Soochow Academy Elementary School Donate Snack Money to Bethany

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Bethany Orphanage began soliciting funds for the construction of a new site, donors have been very enthusiastic. Our newspaper received a letter from the Children's Service Society of Soochow Academy Elementary School yesterday, which stated: "We read about the Bethany Orphanage in the newspaper and felt very sad. Our teachers also told us about the lives of those orphans, and we were very moved. God has given us parents to take care of us and good schools to study in. We cannot forget to love those children without parents. Therefore, we decided to save five days of snack money, put it together, and send it to you, sir, to be forwarded. This 5.7 million yuan is not a large amount, but we hope it can comfort those children, and we also hope that children in other schools will do the same, so that the children of Bethany can have a new home to live in as soon as possible."

### Cheng Cangbo Returns from Abroad, Gives Speech Yesterday on Today's World

[Report from Our Newspaper] Legislator and News Paper Publisher Cheng Cangbo, who attended the World Press Conference, gave a speech at the Zhapu Road Cultural Hall at 2:00 PM yesterday, talking about his observations of Europe and the United States, titled "Today's World." Cheng listed the conspiratorial activities of communists in various European and American countries. Although Stalin declared that the Third International had been dissolved, in fact, the underground activities of the Third International have intensified. Fortunately, various European and American countries have seen through their deceit and have risen up to stop them, such as the failure of the Communist Party in Italy and the passage of bills by the US Congress to punish Communist Parties that mislead the country. In short, today's world is not the only country suffering from the Red Scare. The conspiracy is actually aimed at the entire world. Moreover, from all aspects, communism cannot coexist with other ideologies because it denies all factors other than material, and it denies human nature and personality. Today, the United States is leading the Western democracies in the fight against communism. Leftists use the collapse of American capitalism for propaganda. In fact, the general material life in the United States has reached a very high level. Although prices are higher than before the war, the multiple of wage income is still higher. Moreover, its federal legislation is gradually moving towards the road of socialism, so the United States shows no signs of decline or corruption. When I (Cheng said himself) returned to China, I passed through San Francisco, where a "I am an American" festival was being held. Americans were proud to be Americans, and their firm self-confidence was admirable. I especially call on all compatriots across the country today. We should also be proud to be Chinese, take responsibility for ourselves, and believe that our Republic of China will achieve prosperity and freedom.

### Hengfeng Road Bridge Opened to Traffic Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The opening ceremony of the Hengfeng Road Bridge in the city was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. A white cloth banner was hung in the center of the bridge, with the words "For the Opening Ceremony of the New Hengfeng Road Bridge, Prosper the City and Benefit the People." Red and green ribbons were hung at the southern end. Residents gathered at both ends of the bridge, reaching thousands of people. The ceremony was presided over by Mayor Wu. Attendees included Zhao Zukang, Xu Ji**, Chen Baotai, Ouyang Zunming, Li Ximou, Wang Shengshan, Xiang Changquan, and Ding Guitang. After Mayor Wu led the ceremony, he delivered a speech stating: During the former concession period, the various constructions in the city can be said to be complete. However, during the enemy's period, there was only destruction and no construction. After the victory, everything was waiting to be done. At present, the most important problem in the city is municipal construction. Generally speaking, the restoration of Nanshi focuses on the construction of docks, and the restoration of Zhabei focuses on the construction of bridges. The completion of the Hengfeng Road Bridge is just one of the construction plans."

Then, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, reported on the construction process and expressed three hopes: (1) Citizens must love the bridges (2) Other bridges can be built in order. (3) The Zhabei West District hopes to gradually complete the urban planning and road system. Zhao said: The construction of the Hengfeng Bridge is based on the principle of economic practicality. It is not as beautiful as the Sichuan Road Bridge and the Henan Road Bridge, but the bridge body is strong. The total length of the bridge is 52.73 meters, the span of the side holes is 10.36 meters, and the middle three holes are a total of 105 feet wide. The bridge is 17.47 meters wide, including an 11.89-meter carriageway and a 2.179-meter pedestrian walkway, which can accommodate four cars in parallel. The total cost of labor and materials is more than 3 billion yuan in national currency.

At 10:25, after the speech was completed, Mayor Wu presided over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The music was melodious, and the citizens on both sides applauded and cheered. Mayor Wu led the way in a car, followed by the vehicles of the heads of various agencies. The opening ceremony was then completed.

### Affected by the Rampant Rise in Off-Site Prices, Rice Price Hikes Continue Unabated: Grain Administration Authorities Once Dumped 6,000 Shi of Rice on the Market

[Our Report] Rice prices continue to rise relentlessly. Yesterday, the retail price was 11 million yuan per shi, and there is still a continuing upward trend. Yesterday, the grain administration authorities sold 6,000 shi of rice to supply the market, but this was like a drop in the bucket and could not stop the rising trend.

After Guan Jiyu, the Minister of Food, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, rice merchants in the city were wary and rice prices were temporarily stable. However, Minister Guan hurriedly returned to Beijing after consulting with Mayor Wu. Even Ren Xianqun, the chairman of the Shanghai People's Opinion Survey Committee, was unable to meet with Minister Guan.

Yesterday morning, Ren Xianqun, chairman of the People's Opinion Survey Committee, Huang Jiaju, a specialist committee member of the municipal government, and Gu Mingzhai, chief of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau, were stationed at the market. At the opening of the market, Chairman Ren announced the sale of 6,000 shi of rice, with 3,000 shi each for the north and south markets, at a price of 9.2 million yuan per shi. Public sentiment tended to weaken and asking prices fell. However, around 10:00 AM, prices for all commodities outside the market rose sharply. Cigarettes and soap rose by 20%, and gold and paper money also strengthened. At the same time, the money supply was too loose, and promissory notes were flying around in the market. Rice prices then rose again. The grain officials stationed at the market sighed at their inability to do anything.

Yesterday's rice prices in the North Market: Top White Japonica 10.3 million yuan, Thin Indica 10.02 million yuan, Early Rice 10.005 million yuan, Sheep Xiang 10.03 million yuan. Rice prices in the South Market: Top White Japonica 10 million yuan, Medium Thin Indica 10 million yuan, Early Rice 9.9 million yuan. Arrivals in the North Market were 1,885 shi, and arrivals in the South Market were 3,046 shi, for a total of 4,931 shi. The amount of rice supplied was 6,000 shi.

Flour prices followed the rise of all commodities and soared again. The Central Trust Bureau still did not release any flour, which further strengthened public sentiment. The loose money supply further fueled the buying trend. Army Ship Flour alone rose to 3.5 million yuan, and Old Car Flour to 3.51 million yuan, up 260,000 to 300,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng were also available, with the former at 3.35 million yuan and the latter at 3.4 million yuan. Large-bag wheat bran was 3.05 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan, and wheat opened at 4.7 million yuan.

The price of miscellaneous grains did not fall. Public sentiment remained strong, and sellers continued to raise prices. Soybeans rose by over 300,000 yuan. Hankou New Beans closed at 5.9 million yuan. Corn prices were expected to rise further, increasing by about 400,000 yuan. Although the sales of mung beans and red sorghum were not high, prices also rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan due to the support of sellers. The arrival of new broad beans was still high, and consumer appetite waned, causing the market to stabilize. Yuan wheat rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Sesame prices were only slightly firm yesterday after rising sharply the day before. Uncooked peanuts from Guangzhou lacked consumer interest and fell by 500,000 yuan.

Edible oil prices continued to rise, and the market was even firmer at the close, with even higher prices. Although sellers initially raised prices along with the rise in grain prices in the morning, prices at the close were 500,000 yuan higher than at the opening. Dachang New Soybean Oil opened at 23.7 million yuan, and Datong Soybean Oil closed at 24.3 million yuan, up about 1.6 million yuan. Jittong Crude Oil was 32 million yuan, up 2 million yuan. Crude vegetable oil opened at 22.5 million yuan and rose to 23 million yuan later in the market. Small Car Sesame Oil rose again to 32.8 million yuan, and soybean cake rose by 180,000 to 190,000 yuan.

### Rumors of Authorities Taking Decisive Action: Chinese Stocks Weakened Near Closing

Chinese stocks had an upward trend yesterday but fluctuated. Although Yong Yarn reached a new high, it was extremely vulnerable near closing. This was attributed to rumors that the President would take decisive action and that state-owned stocks would be listed.

The market opened strong in the morning. There were reports that the Minister of Finance had resigned. Yong Yarn opened high at 3,980 yuan, but was sold down to 3,935 yuan. Due to the unusually high demand for yarn and cloth, it rose to a new high of 4,020 yuan. Agency fees opened high at 33 yuan and 37 yuan, but retreated to 3,920 yuan. However, foreign stocks and yarn and cloth prices remained strong, and there were some rebounds. The market advanced again to the 4,000 yuan mark before becoming volatile due to tightening credit and a rebound in yarn and cloth prices. It retreated to 3,930 yuan and closed at 3,940 yuan, the same as the previous close for Rongfeng and Huafeng. Xinyi rose by 10%, Zhongfa rose by 5%, and other stocks saw minor fluctuations.

After the evening news reported that US loans had been restored to their original amount, Yong Yarn retreated to 3,910 yuan immediately upon the opening of after hours trading, and was even sold down to 3,840 yuan. The National Bank's trading volume was not high, only over 1 trillion, but this was only the amount of deposits from the same industry. The market gradually rebounded and advanced to a new high of 4,040 yuan. Rumors spread that the President had issued a written directive to take decisive action on the market, and it fell to 3,890 yuan at closing. After the close, the market continued to weaken. Zhongfa also saw a pullback after reaching its limit up. Compared to the morning close, Zhongfa rose by half a percent after reaching its limit up, Jinglun fell by half a percent, Tongyi and Yonggong were flat, and other stocks saw fluctuations. Off-market, unlisted stocks saw mixed performance, with the Bank of China halting its rise and returning to flat.

Government bonds were initially weak but later bullish yesterday. Tong Bing opened at 470,000, fell to 440,000, and rebounded to close at 495,000 near noon. Compared to the previous close, Jia, Yi, and Ding each rose by 35,000, Bing rose by 50,000, and Wu rose by 45,000. The trading volume was about 4 million.

The upward trend in foreign stocks expanded yesterday due to increasing external stimulus. Rubber stocks were in high demand, with few sellers. English Rubber at 2.2 million yuan had buyers, and Langelands at 1.45 million yuan had buyers. Galanda at 120,000 had transactions, and the market was very active. Individual investors were selling, while foreign merchants were buying up Jardine Matheson and Paton quite a bit. Ewo opened at 6.38 million yuan in the morning and rose to close around 6.55 million yuan. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson and Wing On rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly.

New shares of the National Goods Company are scheduled to be listed today, with a trading unit of 1 million shares.

### Exchange Settlement Certificate Price Rises to 630,000 Yuan

[Our Report] The price of exchange settlement certificates rose again yesterday, from 580,000 yuan at the opening to 630,000 yuan, with the exchange rate calculated to be 1,104,000 yuan. The trading volume was also high.

### Ministry of Economy Instructs Three Measures for Registered Cotton Yarn Cases

[Our Report] The Yarn Control Committee, in handling violation cases, previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Economy to establish a committee to review violation cases. The Ministry of Economy has issued instructions regarding the punishment for failing to register cotton yarn.

(1) For those who fail to apply for registration after the deadline following the public announcement, the committee will issue a warning or suspend allocation, depending on the severity of the circumstances, and still order them to apply for registration within a specified period.

(2) If, after the specified registration period, they still fail to register and there is no evidence of hoarding or speculation, the committee will submit a detailed account of the facts of the case, along with the case file, to the Ministry for approval and punishment in accordance with the law, and then hand it over to the committee for execution.

(3) If, after the public announcement or specified registration period, they still fail to register and there is evidence of hoarding or speculation, they should cooperate with the local competent government authorities (the Social Bureau in Shanghai) to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations for cracking down on hoarding and speculation of important daily necessities. The committee will actively proceed with the handling of the matter after receiving the above instructions, it is said.

### Yarn Control Committee Continues to Dump Cotton

[Our Report] The Yarn Control Committee, in order to assist the Central Bank in tightening the money supply, has continuously sold a total of 58,000 dan of cotton from May 19th to June 15th. It is currently discussing with the Central Bank to continue selling cotton to stabilize cotton prices, it is said.

### Bullish Sentiment Leads to Constant Buying: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Repeatedly Reach Highs: Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Continues to Rise to 66 Million

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw constant buying from all sides due to the still loose money supply, and sentiment within the market was largely bullish. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by about 30 million at the opening. Subsequently, with both new buying and short covering, and strong interest from Tianjin, Guangdong and other regional traders, the market frequently flew to new highs, and closed at a new high price of 590 million yuan, a further sharp increase of 66 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other coarse and fine yarns also rose by more than 10%.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw prices continue to soar as yarn prices continued to fly high, and the market was awash with capital. There was a large amount of hoarding and buying, and short covering was urgent. Large traders were active, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened 600,000 higher due to frequent positive news, and sellers were only willing to sell at that price. Subsequently, as buying interest from regional traders slackened, the market trended weaker, but it was immediately heard that dyeing factories and the oil industry were secretly buying up large quantities, the market was strongly bullish, and the market once again set a new record of 118 million yuan.

After 10:00 AM, traders from Tianjin sold at high prices, and over-the-counter traders also sold to take profits, while the Textile Construction Bureau allocated supplies, leading to a temporary decline mid-day. As the price of goods outside of Textile Construction Bureau continued to rise, the people's hearts and minds were again strengthened, Dragon Head cloth finally returned to close at 114 million yuan, a sharp increase of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other medium and low-grade fine cloths, as well as fine twill, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, colored cloth, shilin cloth, serge and other markets, also flourished.

### After the Announcement of the New Exchange Settlement Measures: Export Industry Provides Opinions: Several Technical Issues Must Be Resolved

[Our Report] In order to understand the impact of the new exchange settlement rules stipulated in Circular No. 134 on the export industry, the Export Control Committee recently invited more than 20 export industry leaders to exchange views, presided over by Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Department. The export industry believes that the new exchange settlement method is more reasonable in principle, and the interests of the import and export industries can be balanced as a result. However, in order for this method to achieve the expected results, several technical issues must be resolved reasonably, such as whether the issuance of import licenses can be coordinated with exchange settlement certificates, and whether the Central Bank can adjust its position so that exchange settlement certificates can have reasonable prices, etc. Summarizing the opinions of various exporters, the most important points are as follows: (1) Technical issues of exchange settlement certificates: (A) The 7-day deadline is too short, please allow a reasonable extension; (B) The designated banks should agree on reasonable prices according to the supply and demand of exchange settlement certificates to allow free buying and selling; (C) Importers should be allowed to retain the foreign exchange of their permitted imports, and more import licenses should be issued to seek a balance; (D) The exchange rate of the Balance Committee should be frozen, or the exchange settlement certificate should be annotated with "This certificate will be settled at the exchange rate of the Balance Committee on the same day" to avoid losses to exporters who have not sold their exchange settlement certificates when the exchange rate changes. (2) Export visa system should be adopted to prevent underreporting of prices; (3) Packing loans should be continued; (4) Procurement methods should be continued; (5) Smuggling should be eliminated; (6) The yarn and cloth industry provides opinions that the new exchange settlement method should also be applied to yarn and cloth exports; At the same time, there are too many export appraisal agencies, and their unification should be sought. Exporters also hope that the Export Control Committee can maintain contact with the export industry in the future and communicate opinions from time to time.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 14th] Large numbers of northeastern students are entering Guan. Beiping Provisional University held its first preparatory committee meeting on the 15th to prepare for classes. However, there is still no progress on funds.

The pre-university class of Jinzhou Provisional University arrived on the 13th with 487 students, who applied to Beiping Provisional University. The authorities of the Provisional University stated that they would not accept them, and the problem of private schools accepting them has not been resolved. Due to the increasing number of students coming to Shenyang Liaodong College, Women's College of Arts and Sciences, and Normal College, and the inability to provide food and lodging, registration has been suspended. Many temples are already overcrowded, and new arrivals are sleeping on the streets. The principal of the Provisional University, Hou Jingshu, has not yet appeared due to the lack of funds, and is scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 15th to meet with Minister Zhu for instructions. Over a thousand students are only getting thirteen taels of corn flour per person per day. A special report has been published to express dissatisfaction with Hou.

Those who are not admitted will be allocated to the Provisional High School. (3) It is requested to allocate the Shuncheng Prince's Mansion and Fengzeyuan in Zhongnanhai as school buildings. (4) It is requested that the Ministry of Education order the Provisional High Schools in Beiping and Tianjin to give priority to hiring teachers and staff from the pre-university classes of the three northeastern universities and Changbai Normal School in Jinzhou.

### Liǎngjiāng and Zhōngqīng Swimming Pools to Open on Schedule: Liǎngjiāng: This Sunday; Zhōngqīng: July 1st

The Liǎngjiāng Women's Physical Education College swimming pool on Wèi Jīmài Road was opened to the public last summer and was well received. Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been oppressively hot, and swimming enthusiasts have visited several times in the past week. The site has been undergoing repairs to the water pump and internal renovations, which have taken time, and it has not yet opened. It has now been decided to officially open on Sunday morning of this week at 10:00 AM, which is expected to be a grand occasion.

Another report states that although the Zhōnghuá Youth Association swimming pool on Sìchuān Road is small, it cultivates nearly a thousand new talents every year. The warm water swimming season has just ended, and the swimming pool is undergoing repairs and preparing for this summer's swimming season. However, due to the sharp rise in prices this year, the association is facing great difficulties, especially as the cost of water, electricity, labor, and pool water chemicals has exceeded last year's by a hundredfold. The budget for expenses, including repairs, has reached 1 billion yuan. Considering the burden on participants, the fees cannot be too high, so the association's thousand-person swimming program this summer will be reduced to a maximum of 600 people to save costs. It is reported that the association's swimming pool will be open from July 1st to the end of August. The swimming classes are still divided into beginner, intermediate, advanced, self-study, women's, and group classes, using the latest accelerated scientific teaching methods. Registration will begin on the 20th of this month at the association's inquiry office. Anyone who has a medical certificate proving that they have no heart disease or infectious diseases can participate. Detailed regulations are available on file.

### World Games Delegation Accused of Inappropriate Measures: Sports Circles in Beijing File Complaint, Petitioning Minister of Education Zhū for Thorough Investigation

[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing] Forty-two members of the Nanjing sports community, including Chén Jūnmó, Xú Rǔkāng, and Yuán Zhònglián, expressed dissatisfaction with the various measures taken by our country's World Games delegation and petitioned Minister of Education Zhū Jiāhuá, requesting a thorough investigation, withholding passports, and strict review. They also requested that the secretary-general of the delegation, Dǒng Shǒuyì, publicly respond. The points of criticism in the letter to Minister Zhū are as follows:

Creating Pretexts to Place Personal Connections

(1) The selection of World Games athletes has qualified standards and strict restrictions to avoid indiscriminate participation. However, the delegation, which has nothing to do with the actual competition, is creating pretexts to arbitrarily place personal connections, resulting in a number far exceeding the number of athletes. Apart from the football team, which has already left the country, the three teams for basketball, track and field, and swimming have only 14 athletes in total, while the delegation staff includes over ten positions such as the head of the delegation, secretary-general, consultant, leader, instructor, manager, secretary, Chinese secretary, English secretary, head coach, staff, assistant staff, and attendants, totaling twenty to thirty people. Among them, only seven or eight are sports professionals, while the rest are either merchants or businessmen. It is said that these people are seeking to go abroad for other commercial purposes. If this is the case, it will only become an international joke.

Deceiving the Government, Engaging in Self-interest and Collusion

(2) The former Ministry of Education had plans to organize a World Games sports observation group, but as the World Games delegation is about to depart, there is no news of the observation group. What benefits can so many non-sports personnel in the delegation bring to the future of Chinese sports, other than sightseeing and pursuing their private purposes? It is said that some of them are going abroad at their own expense, but the delegation is creating pretexts for them and securing passports, which is a waste of foreign exchange and deceiving the government. The organizers are suspected of engaging in self-interest and collusion.

Raising Funds Without Authorization, Taking Foreign Planes

(3) The Ministry of Education has already subsidized the delegation with US$25,000. The organizers of the delegation are expanding the organization without authorization. On the one hand, they are claiming insufficient funds and soliciting donations everywhere, but the amount received has not been made public. On the other hand, they are unwilling to accept the preferential treatment of China National Aviation Corporation and are taking foreign planes, spending over US$9,000 more. The purpose of this is baffling.

Literature

### The Authenticity of Literature

— Tāng Kuāngyíng

Didn't Tolstoy say that art is a beautiful lie?

Perhaps it's because they excessively believe in art, that in novels, plays, and various stories, authors intentionally exaggerate many colors, making readers like spectators in front of a magician, being subjected to sleight of hand and told enormous lies. In the meantime, it is precisely because everyone has this idea in their minds: "This is just a fictional construct from the writers' pens!"

Those who take literature as social realism inevitably get seen as the biggest fools. Everyone thinks that the lack of authenticity in literary content seems to be a foregone conclusion. In fact, in recent years, everyone has been merely praising the greatness of this era. In terms of literary works, we have novels depicting the heroic battles on the front lines, works depicting the exchange of light and darkness in the rear, and many writings filled with nostalgia and talent. But in the midst of all this, is there a new god that is realistic enough? That is a big question mark. The saying that art is the biggest lie is their creed. So, only some people are hiding in dark corners, shouting "Enough, enough" at the endless flow of works; while some writers rarely think that their pens are merely cameras, and even though they capture mountains, rivers, grass, and trees on film, they lack a soul inside.

Originally, art or literature is a record of social consciousness and the image of the social reality, expressed through words; it should be a record of life. Writers solemnly take it to the heart, and whether it's the universe or a tiny fly, there is a spiritual sustenance, so that art does not become a soulless, exquisite photograph, but has its own inherent authenticity.

Some people say that the appreciation of literature is multifaceted. An archaeologist only knows to pay attention to broken bowls and shattered porcelain, a history enthusiast only cares about the age and background of the work, while an aestheticist only cares about the richness of the words. Therefore, those who argue against it insist on this point, arguing that although literature is a realistic depiction of facts that may occur in society, it cannot be said that literature has no existence at all apart from this element. This statement seems to have a few distorted reasons on the surface, but after revealing it, this is actually another deception. Whether it is broken bowls and shattered porcelain in the hands of an archaeologist, ancient poetry and songs in the hands of a historian, or a hymn in the hands of an aestheticist, but those as literary works, in a certain period of time in the past, undeniably reflect the image of the social consciousness and the social reality of that era. For example, the fragments of paper in the Dūnhuáng Thousand Buddha Caves today are merely historical relics in the hands of an archaeologist, but in the hands of a social scholar, they are also a living record of that era.

In fact, looking back at the various records in the history of Chinese literature, realistic depictions were regarded as the standard by some progressive literati thousands of years ago. Although in this distant history, the literature praising feudalism and the emperor was too bloated, some places were inevitably exaggerated in literary displays; but great works of literature are often a reflection of the real environment and the social persecution. Confucius' Spring and Autumn Annals, Qu Yuan's Lisao, and Zuo Si's Rhapsody on the Three Capitals are all persecutions of reality and critiques of society, but each person's literary techniques are a bit different, but their goals are the same.

Therefore, today, some scholars, after carefully examining the current literary environment in China, believe that the May Fourth Literary Revolution did open up a new situation in the Chinese literary scene, which had been dull for so long, but because of subsequent complacency, some shallow scholars only brought in some foreign literary dregs, and destroyed and scattered the inherent strengths of Chinese literature. This is really not a harsh statement. It has been more than twenty years from the May Fourth Movement to now. Although this time is not long, it is not short either. Even if the literary world before the May Fourth Movement was chaotic, we should now have drawn a clue. Moreover, we estimate that the impression given to people by this eight-year sacred War of Resistance, in all aspects, will not be reduced compared to the situation in the May Fourth era. So now there should be a more amazing and novel discovery in the reform of literature in our country. However, where is the so-called literary discovery today? Although works are being manufactured in the literary factory, what else is there besides becoming a literary disaster, glittering and dazzling?

However, to bring the topic back, in this era, the social turmoil and the attachment of material conditions for some writers are an irreparable regret for literature. Writers often cannot achieve a balanced development in emotion and writing because they are forced by these two conditions. The so-called balanced development of emotions and words is like what Ms. Bīng Xīn said in her book "To Young Readers": "When words are more than emotions, and emotions are more than words, it is not the time to write an article." Because when emotions cannot control words, words lose their authenticity; when words lose emotions, emotions lose their existence; words and emotions are a body and soul, and the writer's pen is the breathing tube between this body and soul.

After the victory, everyone sighed in disappointment, wondering why there were not more great works with authenticity being produced. In fact, because of the constraints of the two conditions above, writers are afraid to persecute reality; because it is something that cannot be done for a poor writer who only cares about food and clothing and has no time to settle down. In the eyes of onlookers, it is something that writers do not do; but they are neglecting that this era is using a giant lever to press on the backs of writers to make them prostrate and submit?

We certainly recognize that this era is great, and we certainly recognize that art is not a beautiful lie; we certainly recognize that writers should try their best to describe the things that may happen in this great era, and describe its living authenticity; but we also have a more important request: that writers should have a more powerful guarantee in life.

### My Family's Flower

— Shòu Juān

——Violet, Miscellany

The great Confucian scholar Zhōu Liánxī of the Song Dynasty wrote "On the Love of Lotus," giving the highest praise to the lotus flower that emerges from the mud without being stained. He was truly a confidant of the lotus flower, so later generations nominated Lord Liánxī as the Flower God of June for the twelve months of the year. I, in my humble life, am content with simplicity and have never had the ambition to attach myself to the powerful. However, I am happy to associate myself with flowers and trees, simply because my surname is Zhōu, and the ancestral hall name passed down through generations happens to be "Love of Lotus." Therefore, I must attach myself to this noble flower and unceremoniously call it "My Family's Flower."

The lotus has the most aliases: Fúlián, Fúróng, Water Zhī, Òuhuā, Water Yún, Water Dàn, Water Brush, Zézhī, Yùhuán, and the most common is Hèhuā. Now everyone commonly calls it Lotus or Hèhuā, and no longer uses other names. The lotus also has a particularly large number of varieties, including the Twin Lotus, Four-Faced Lotus, First-Class Lotus, Thousand-Petaled Lotus, Double-Decked Lotus, etc. There are also other bizarre and wonderful varieties that have long been unique and impossible to collect. It is unknown when the lotus began, but it does have a birthday, which is the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar. It is also unknown who decided this day for it. The custom in Wú calls this day the Guānshù Festival. Ladies in the Wú region often take painted boats with flutes and drums to view the lotuses in the Lotus Pond outside Fēng Gate. Nowadays, life is difficult, and everyone no longer has such leisure and elegance. The poet Xú Hóngzhāi of the Qing Dynasty wrote two poems on the birthday of the lotus: "The summer heat subsides before the lotus leaves in the wind, and the river flows at the mouth of the lotus pond; today is the lotus' birthday, and my wife and I open the boat together." "The official of Jīntán, Duàn Chángqīng, sings quietly in the wind; strange, his face is as beautiful as the lotus, and he was born on the birthday of the lotus." Flower historians can use this as material.

Throughout ancient and modern times, the poems, prose, lyrics, and allusions about the lotus flower are too numerous to count. In the future, when I am in a better mood, I plan to compile a special collection to promote my family's flower. The oldest prose is the "Memorial to the Throne from the Hundred Officials Congratulating on the Auspicious Thousand-Petaled Lotus" by Cui Rong of the Tang Dynasty. Mǐn Hóng of the Han Dynasty and Cao Zhi of the Wei Dynasty each have a "Lotus Rhapsody." The oldest poem is probably the anonymous ancient poem "Crossing the River to Pick Lotus, Many Fragrant Herbs in the Orchid Marsh, Who to Give What Is Picked, My Thoughts Are on a Distant Road..." As for the several great poets of the Tang Dynasty, almost all have a "Lotus Picking Song," which is even more beautiful.

One day after the lotus' birthday last summer, my brother Táo Lěngyuè returned to Sūzhōu from Shanghai. Brother Chéng Xiǎoqīng hired a boat and invited me and brothers Fàn Yānqiáo and Hé Shìxīn to go to the Lotus Pond to view the lotuses. Although we did not go deep into the pond, we did see many graceful white lotuses, appearing unstained by dust, making people sigh like Lù Lǔwàng, "This flower is truly fit to be in the Jade Pool." Zhōngshān Park is not far from my home. There are two lotus ponds in the park, one large and one small, planted with red lotuses, which are bright and lovely. I have visited twice to admire them, lingering and forgetting to return when looking at the clusters of green canopies and red buds. As for the lotus pond under the Mei Qiu of my home, although there are white and light red varieties, more than a dozen bloomed last year, but the area is too small, and only two or three bloom at the same time, which is not enough to satisfy the eye. The old Four-Faced Guānyīn was extinct during the occupation period. Last spring, several red lotus branches were transplanted from the park, which grew leaves but did not bloom. I can only wait until this year. Senior fellow villager, Mr. Pān Jìrú, collects and plants potted lotuses, with as many as seven famous varieties such as Layered Terrace, Sprinkled Gold, and White Lotus with Inlaid Edges. I went to admire them and found them difficult to describe. Old Mr. Jì promised to give me some roots next spring, which made me overjoyed. My old friend, Brother Jiǎng Yínqiū, also promised to transplant one or two twin lotuses and Four-Faced Guānyīn from the Kě Garden in the library. He also said that he has an old friend, Mr. Lú Bīnshì, who is the only expert in Wúzhōng who cultivates bowl lotuses, and can bloom red and white lotuses in a small bowl. He pre-arranged to give me a bowl as a table decoration for the Hall of Love of Lotus when the lotus flowers bloom this year. Last summer, in memory of my late wife, Fèngjūn, I specially planted famous varieties of Phoenix Immortals (Balsam) outside the Phoenix Coming Ceremony Room. After autumn, they still bloomed brilliantly, so last year can be said to be the year of the Phoenix Immortals, and this year should be the year of the lotus. If the results are not bad, then on the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, I will definitely invite worthy friends to raise a glass to celebrate the birthday of my family's flower.

So you also once picked up a pen to contemplate

Carrying the burden of life and embarking on a new path

You said what else can you say to me

Surely afraid of being tormented by emotion

The foolishness of love has already fallen before your eyes

Just wanting to get rid of the worries of the distance

But it makes you feel fear again

Enduring the pain and wandering in the wilderness

Just like a young deer escaping the hunter

It is difficult to find a secluded valley

Borrow an oar from wisdom

Learn from that small boat going against the current

Fully loaded with a boat of clear sorrow

Remotely pointing to the dawn of the end of the world

You will steady the rudder of reason

I said why say anything more

Wait until the fading years grow old

Instruct the surroundings to leave a piece of silence

To recognize this accidental infatuation

Who takes love as the truth

No need to pick up a pen to contemplate anymore

The universe will always contain mystery

### Writers and Pain

— Dōngfāng Jìbái

The works of many great writers, ancient and modern, East and West, are produced from the author's distress and sorrow, and they want to conquer pain through literature and art. —Lafcadio Hearn

Using pain is the extreme of literary creation—there is no greater requirement. Conversely, those who do not know this pain can definitely not—never can write great works. —Lafcadio Hearn.

What can give an artist the most powerful expressiveness is probably pain. —Romain Rolland

All geniuses are melancholic. —Aristotle

Too much sorrow leads to emotion, too much joy leads to tastelessness. —Xiè Zhēn

### The Death of a Rose

— Yìn

Sending you a flower

A freshly picked rose

See how fragrant it is

Because it

Just left the soil, sunlight, and rain

But by tomorrow

It will wither

And finally fade

Having left the rain, sunlight, and soil

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

Recent Italian Literary Scene

From the outside, Italian bookstores appear very appealing, filled with beautifully bound art books and travel guides in cheerful colors. However, upon entering, one is often disappointed, as the books on offer are much the same as in other European countries. A stranger seeking to understand the general trends and interests of the Italian intelligentsia will primarily find titles like "Amber," Hersey's "Hiroshima," and novels by Koestler, who recently visited America from England. This enthusiasm for foreign works is common throughout Europe, and Italy is no exception. They translate not only English, French, and American works, but also modern German and Soviet literature. They publish numerous Soviet plays, essays, and short stories, as well as collections of individual authors, such as the collected works of Ehrenburg, and even translated a history of Russian literature. Works by modern German writers such as Jaspers and Weill are also widely translated.

Italy's interest in foreign works is much greater than that of England and France. This is partly because after twenty years of Fascist oppression, they are eager to catch up on what they missed. Years ago, Megaro's "The Achievements of Mussolini" and Heiden's "Hitler" were republished, alongside biographies of figures like Ilya Ehrenburg and Stalin.

Writers who were banned by Mussolini in the 1920s and 30s have once again aroused great interest among readers. Names such as Salvemini, Sturzo, Sforza, Nitti, and Borgese have regained prominence in the Italian literary scene.

Among the anti-Fascist writers is Antonio Gramsci, whose literary works are only now becoming known, though he died ten years ago. Before Mussolini came to power, Gramsci was a member of parliament. He was later imprisoned under Fascist rule and remained incarcerated until 1937. He was released due to serious illness and died shortly after. It is said that the reason he had to be imprisoned was to "prevent a mind like his for twenty years." But even though the Fascists isolated him from the outside world, they could not paralyze his spirit. In prison, he continued to correspond with friends and write. His collection of letters has been published and hailed as a masterpiece of Italian literature.

These letters are notable not only for their political ideas but also for their literary technique. The letters discuss philosophy, history, and economics, his thought bridging the gap between Croce's idealism and Karl's materialism. His letters will become an important source for understanding the Italian intellectual class of the last thirty years. Especially admirable is his perspective on life and scientific objectivity. Despite external pressures and worsening illness, he retained the strength of a hero, fighting against danger and refusing to be dragged down by it.

In pure literature, two books are noteworthy: one is Carlo Levi's "Christ Stopped at Eboli," which has already been translated into English. The other is Giuseppe Berto's "The Sky is Red," written by the young author while still a prisoner of war. It seems to have been influenced by Erskine Caldwell’s "God's Little Acre," with each chapter describing the reconstruction of a bombed city.

Italian novels do not pay much attention to new psychological methods or stylistic experiments; they focus more on content than form.

### Reader Consultation Legal Advice

Abundant Wealth is Often a Curse for Descendants: Mother and Son Turn Against Each Other Over Inheritance

Lin Baocheng asks: My friend, Mr. Jia, has always had a poor relationship with his mother (Yi). In the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Jia's father passed away, and Yi intended to separate from Jia according to the will (Jia was already married at the time). However, Jia's income was insufficient to support his wife and child, so he was unable to carry out the separation. After Jia's father's death, all of the inheritance remained in his mother's hands. Now, Jia is requesting a division of the property and has a few questions: (1) The will does not specify the amount or nature of the inheritance. Now, Yi claims that she has already consumed it all. Can Jia deny this? (2) Is the eldest son not responsible for the living expenses of his mother and younger brother if he has not received any inheritance? (3) If the two brothers have not separated their households, is it legal for the younger brother to falsely claim that the elder brother's property is part of their father's inheritance and demand a share?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers:] (1) Since the will does not specify the inheritance and there is no evidence of the amount of the inheritance, Jia cannot claim to divide his father's inheritance from his mother, Yi. (2) Since Yi is Jia's mother, Jia has a legal obligation to support her. Whether or not Jia has the ability to support her is a matter of fact. If Yi is unable to support herself and Jia is able to support her but deliberately fails to do so, he is guilty of abandonment. (3) The younger brother cannot falsely claim that the elder brother's property is part of their father's inheritance and demand a share.

### Contribution

— Qian Wen

Since the legendary Yellow Emperor invented the south-pointing chariot, the Chinese nation has made many contributions to mankind; the recent victory over the invading countries is also a contribution.

After the victory, what other contributions are there? During the war, others created many novel things, not to mention the atomic bomb. Even defeated Germany produced rocket weapons that the victorious nations had to learn from and improve. Others invented DDT and the jeep, things that even our young children can name. What do we have? We have nothing much to boast about in modern times. However, we have never led but have always followed, and we are not too far behind. So, when others see flying saucers in the sky, we also see them, proving that we are not too far behind. As for observing solar eclipses, I heard that middle school students can participate. There was no report after the observation because the weather was not good, and it was not the observers' fault.

Suddenly, I thought of the pandas that were going to fly to America a few years ago. Pandas prove that our country has vast land and abundant resources, just as others have unearthed someone or other, and we have unearthed a Peking Man in Zhoukoudian. These are all contributions. Among our various contributions in the past three years, the most earth-shattering is "the egg standing up on the first day of spring." This is the first major discovery after the victory, and it belongs to us. Although this discovery makes Einstein laugh, all scientists are honest, and they cannot deny the phenomenon. Perhaps one day in the future, when the egg-standing phenomenon proves to be consistently successful, a wise man among us will come forward and propose the principle of egg-standing, spreading it to the world. At that time, we can tease Mr. Einstein a bit and say, "What's so special about the theory of relativity? Please study my theory of egg-standing." At this time, our new discoveries and new inventions will create new glory. As it is now, it seems that none of Einstein's assistants or close disciples are Chinese.

Pandas are originally a kind of national glory. We originally had more national glories, but they are gradually becoming inferior to pandas. Silk-spinning silkworms, fur-providing beasts, wool, leather, pig bristles, sausage casings, bird feathers, eggs, horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, pigs, and others are either of poor quality or small in quantity. They are not enough for domestic use, and exports are not smooth, so they are indeed less popular than pandas. Our roosters can lay eggs, which is also a novel product, but unfortunately, it is rarely seen. However, raising a rooster that lays eggs is not without glory. Who dares to say that we will not select the best breeds and keep the good ones, so that all the roosters in the world will not crow but lay eggs?

Of course, we must also mention Miss Yang Mei. Recently, the scientific community's explanation for her not eating is that her body contains chlorophyll. Animals have amphibians, and originally the biological world has two-life forms, one body that combines the abilities of both animals and plants. Moreover, this kind of creature is a human being, and humans are the most intelligent of all things, which is not a false statement. This kind of person is born in our country, is this not another kind of national glory? Now, 470 million people are eagerly awaiting the arrival of American aid food, and one in 470 million people can live without a grain of rice or wheat. Our country is indeed abundant in things (humans are living things), and it may make an incredible contribution to academic research, but unfortunately, it makes no contribution to the stomachs of our compatriots!

I hear that all countries around the world are working hard to increase production, but our country's contribution to people and to ourselves is only a few kinds of information that were included in the records of omens and portents by the historians of previous generations.

### The Largest News Agency

— Mao Yi

"W.H. Smith & Son" on Portugal Street in London is one of the world's largest news agencies. It sells more than one million newspapers every day. The sales volume of weekly magazines is close to two million copies.

The business of Smith Company is now not limited to newspapers and magazines. It has expanded to books, stationery, circulating libraries, printing, group purchases, advertising, and binding. It has a total of 1,500 bookstores and newsstands, and another 58 wholesale branches.

Its book department regularly stocks 80,000 different kinds of books, with a total of nearly one million copies. The book collection in each branch is also comparable to this number. Another one million books are circulating in the various libraries. More than 500 branches have rental departments. In addition, the company repairs about 100,000 fountain pens every year.

The head office receives an average of 30,000 letters per week. The annual cost for newspaper subscribers is nearly £50,000. The stamp duty on receipts is £1,000 per year, which shows the prosperity of its business.

The date of establishment of Smith Company cannot be verified. It was probably in 1792, when Henry Walton Smith and his wife Anna were running a small paper shop. Their son, William Henry, later expanded the business a bit. When it was passed down to his son, William Henry II, he obtained the exclusive rights to set up newsstands on the railway lines, so the business developed rapidly and grew by leaps and bounds.

The company employs more than 10,000 people, many of whom have served for more than 30 years. Their positions are not without opportunities for advancement. The company encourages loyal service by promoting colleagues. Many people who were newsboys many years ago have become senior executives of the company. This spirit of Smith Company, regardless of origin, increases the hope and efficiency of its employees, which is one of the factors for its business development.

### Presented to Guo Linshuang

— Zhu Nianzu

Mr. Guo Linshuang raised funds for the Guang Zhao Association's People's Hospital, and the famous Cantonese opera actresses Li Xuefang and Zhong Fenghua performed famous plays such as Wang Baochuan and Chu Bawang for charity. This poem is to commemorate the event.

The Guo family in Fenyang has a beautiful demeanor,
Playing in the red carpet is also talented.
I suspect that the general descended from the sky,
And the beauty lowered her voice to persuade him to drink before the horse.

It is difficult to combine the bronze pipa and golden thread,
Such fame and glory cannot be compared with the capital.
A song of Yangchun originally had a purpose,
Heroic loyalty and hometown feelings.

Elegant tunes invade the humble lanes,
Across the river, I sadly listen to the sound of a girl's voice.
Lingnan's Xiao and flute have an extraordinary sound,
Singing alone in Jiangdong is also a magnificent chant.

### A Trip to Lingyin Temple

— Banmeng Laoren (Old Man Half-Dream)

Recently, there was a Master Juzan, whose writing style was magnificent and whose poetry was also profound. The abbot of Lingyin Temple, Quefei, asked him to compile a gazetteer of Lingyin Mountain. Master Juzan then printed a small gazetteer of Lingyin, which included: "The Calling Ape Cave is located under Calling Ape Peak. It is initially wide, but gradually narrows as you go deeper. Sometimes you have to crawl on the ground to pass. The ground is all fine sand. You walk about a mile, and when your strength is exhausted, you can come out. There is an inscription by Emperor Qianlong on the wall." I have been to Lingyin many times, and I have visited all the nearby caves, but I have never seen a cave that can be entered for a mile. Reading his description, my curiosity was aroused again, so I went down the mountain, took a public bus, and arrived at the Lingyin Mountain gate. After getting off the bus, I sat for a while on a stone in the Chuncong Pavilion. There was someone selling prayer beads with a shoulder pole, and the price was very cheap, so I bought one. When I took it and played with it, it scattered all over the ground. A little boy picked it up for me, but it was still not enough. Passing the Herun Bridge, commonly called the Second Mountain Gate, it is the shared mountain gate of Lingyin and Tianzhu. Bai Juyi's poem says: "One mountain gate becomes two mountain gates, and two temples are originally separated from one temple." The scene is very different now, and Tianzhu is too far away from here. Entering the Longhong Cave, there is a Ligong Pagoda at the entrance of the cave. Turning to the Thread of Sky, also known as the Jade Tree Cave, the top is transparent, and you can see the sky light. Turning again to the Stalactite Cave, a large stone hangs upside down, like a lotus flower hanging down, hollow and exquisite, with Buddha statues carved all over it, a wonderful scene. When walking, if you are not careful, you can bump your head and forehead. However, among these caves, whether there is a cave that requires crawling for a mile, I searched everywhere but could not find it. There are many doors in the cave, going in and out, with grotesque rocks in a dense formation, in thousands of shapes and forms. Judging from the words "flying from afar" in Feilai Peak, it is very consistent. The people of Hangzhou do not organize the scenery, nor do they add any titles, so visitors cannot delve into the location. They glance at it and pass by, and even if they compare it with the book, there is no way to divide it clearly.

In front of Lingyin Temple, there is Cold Spring Pavilion to the east and Zhaolei Pavilion to the west, built along the stream, all leaning against Feilai Peak. Crossing the stream bridge and going west, ascending about one hundred and several tens of steps, there is a pavilion called Cuiwei, which is a scenic spot in front of Lingyin. I wanted to climb up the mountain road from Cuiwei to reach the top of the peak, but I could not find it. So I went down the pavilion and returned to the Stalactite Cave, turned behind the mountain, found a path to climb up, and ascended to the top of Feilai Peak. The peak is not high. There are two tombs of fallen soldiers built on it. From the top of the peak, going forward, there is a path going straight down. I wanted to turn to the front of the Lingyin Mountain gate, and it was already close, and the tea house was in sight, but the road was slippery and the rocks were rugged, and there was nowhere to put my feet, so I had to turn back to the top of the peak, return to the Stalactite Cave, and return to Longhong before reaching the front of the Lingyin gate. Sitting near the releasing life pond and listening to the gurgling sound of the spring, my legs finally recovered. There is a stone cave under the water of the releasing life pond, exquisite and transparent, and the water makes a sound in it, called Zangliu Cave, but I do not understand what the words "Zangliu" mean.

The beauty of the stone walls of Feilai Peak, and the lush trees in front of Lingyin Temple, and the sound of the springs contending, this scenery is the first among the lakes and mountains of Hangzhou. Those who travel to Hangzhou and visit Lingyin will get the essence of it. But like the top of Feilai Peak, there are not many trees, and there are no pavilions and buildings to decorate it. It is like a beauty, only seeing her face, and her misty temples and wind-blown hair, nothing at all, and brocade clothes and skirts, even less to talk about, which is a pity. For the sake of Lingyin, it seems that a broad road should be opened from Cuiwei Pavilion to ascend to the top of the peak, and trees should be planted all around the peak, and pavilions and buildings should be added to the beautiful places, so that there will be a view of fairy mountains and pavilions, and a natural picture will be better accompanied by human power.

### Small Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

A person without faith is a wanderer in thought, homeless.

Eternal smiles are made of eternal patience.

Only the things that are never obtained will not be lost.

Even if a robber lives next door, it is not necessarily terrible; what is terrible is that there is a small thief in the house.

### Universality of Art

— Zhao Jingshen

The various branches of art, such as literature, painting, calligraphy, sculpture, music, drama, etc., each have their universality, so it is often the case that one person can excel in several kinds of art. Recently, I saw the art exhibitions of three painters, and I felt that this statement was correct.

Yu Yang's Wang Shuxi came all the way from Bengbu to Shanghai to hold an art exhibition. He is not only good at painting and calligraphy, but I can see that he is also very accomplished in literature. Therefore, he writes the characters of Wang Xizhi's "Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Collection" the most, and also Fan Zhongyan's "Yueyang Tower Record," Ouyang Xiu's "Drunken Pavilion Record," Du Fu's poems, etc. His paintings include Yuanming appreciating chrysanthemums and Fang Weng's fan. Because he is accomplished in literature and art, his paintings are different from the ordinary, and have the style of "literati painting."

Hai Ning's Qian Junsong is even more needless to say. More than ten years ago, I said this in "Literati Silhouettes": "He understands music, has compiled song collections and operas, and is also a master of cover design, and can also carve stone seals. Occasionally, when he is in the mood, he will write you a letter with a full page of seal characters." This shows that his carving and writing are not something he has done for a day or two. Recently, I also saw his paintings. I like him the most because he can create his own composition and break the tradition. When others paint peony paintings for the middle of a hall, they always leave some "sky space," but he just comes up with a full page; otherwise, he will come up with a pine tree, and specially leave half of the writing space or sky space on it. The "Old Man's Lonely Tree" is also quite unique.

Wu County's Fan Boyan is the son of Shaoyun, with a deep family background, and has seen many famous paintings. He is also a versatile person. He sings old men in Kunqu Opera, and his voice and strength are very abundant. He can also play large sets of pipa. Now I have also seen his Chinese paintings, and landscapes are the best. I most appreciate and love his "Holding a Cup to Enjoy the Moon," "Evening Mooring on a Misty River," "Pine Spring," and "Pine Creek Egret," which I think are very spiritual and have a artistic conception. I don't know why, but I especially like his pine trees.

I am a layman to painting, and all that I have said above can be regarded as the impression of a literary person who does not understand painting.

### 

In March, after reading the book "Slow Records of the Master of Yi Garden," the publisher did not specify who "Yi Garden" was, so I made a special study and found that it was the work of Chen Chong (Liuzhou) of Yizheng, published in this edition. A letter was received by airmail from Mr. Zhao Shixian a few days ago, which was very gratifying, and he also transcribed a letter from Chen to Weng Tonghe, which I also found very interesting. However, the two letters were written to my younger brother, Yishi, and it seems that he mistakenly thought that my brothers were one person. It is said that in the years before the incident, the Tianjin Guowen Weekly had a "Lingxiao Yishi Notes" that was often published, and the editor printed the two pen names in a straight line, and "Lingxiao Yishi" looked like a signature, so that those who read the article "Lingxiao Hange" elsewhere mistakenly thought it was Yishi, and the two letters were mistakenly sent, and there were many twists and turns, and it was still necessary to declare at any time. Thank you for copying the letter from Chen to Weng, the top line calls "Senior Uncle Ping Gongbao," and the content is quite simple. At that time, Weng was no longer in a key position, and it was only a private greeting. First of all, condolences were offered for the death of Weng Zengyuan, which is what the letter said: "The matter of Brother Zhongyuan is truly amazing." Zengyuan's name was Zhongyuan, and he was Tonghe's nephew. He was the top scholar in the Guihai year of Tongzhi two years, and he was a junior to Chen. Chen was the messenger of the previous Renchen year, so he only called Zengyuan "Brother Zhongyuan" and called Tonghe "Senior," because he was Bingchen in Xianfeng, three years earlier than Chen. Suzhou is famous for its many top scholars. According to statistics, in the three hundred years of the former Qing Dynasty, Jiangsu Province ranked first in the country in terms of the number of top scholars, and Suzhou Prefecture ranked first in the entire province. In the thirteen years of the Tongzhi Dynasty, there were six examinations in total, and the Jiangsu scholars ranked first in four, and Suzhou ranked first in three of the four, namely Changshu Weng Zengyuan (Guihai), Wu County Hong Jun (Wuchen), and Yuanhe Lu Runxiang (Jiasu). The remaining three were Xu Fu (Rensu) of Jiading, Jiangsu, Chong Qi (Yichou, father of the Tongzhi Queen), and Liang Yaoshu of Guangdong.

The prosperity of the Weng family of Changshu is comparable to that of the Pan family of Wu County, both of which are outstanding in Suzhou. Weng Tongsu, whose courtesy name was Shuping, later named himself the Old Man of Song Zen and the Old Man of Ping, was the youngest son of the great scholar Weng Xincun, whose posthumous title was Weng Wenzhong. Xincun was a scholar in the Dao Guang Renwu year, the same year as Chen Chong's father, Jiashu. His sons Tongsheng and Tonghe were also scholars, and Tongsheng and his nephew Zengyuan (i.e., the son of Tongsheng) were also top scholars. However, after Zengyuan won the top prize, he was dismissed from his hometown due to illness, and lived in the forest for more than ten years and died, making him the most unfortunate of the top scholars. He did not actually pass the provincial or metropolitan examination, but was granted the honor due to his grandfather and father, and he became famous in the palace examination and won the top prize. He passed away in Dihai, and the old man Yu Yue of Quyu wrote a eulogy couplet: "Three autumn cassia, three spring apricots, all bestowed from heaven, only occupying the top of the golden turtle;"; "Grandson of Wenzhong, son of Wenqin, what is the meaning of returning to lie in the mountains, and finally resigning from the Green Field Hall." The Pan family of Wu County included Pan Shien (the top scholar of the Qianlong Guichou year), Pan Shihuang (the third place scholar of the Qianlong Yimao year), and Pan Zuyin (the third place scholar of the Xianfeng Renzi year). In addition, there were many scholars and scholars, which do not need to be recorded in detail. Zuyin's style name was Boyin, and his hao was Zhengqi. His provincial examination was also bestowed by grace. He ranked third in the Renzi examination, two years earlier than Weng Tonghe, and was a senior scholar. In the early years of the Qing Dynasty, the two were officials of the first rank, and they were both leading figures in the literary world of the capital, and the literary world called them "Weng Pan"; my brother Yishi often said that they should be called "Pan Weng", and Weng should not be added to Pan's name. I said that the title "Pan Weng" sounds like the name of one person, which is easily misunderstood.

The prosperity of Suzhou's top scholars reached its peak in the Tongzhi period, and prosperity declined. There were thirteen examinations in the Guangxu Dynasty, but there was not a single Suzhou scholar. (There were two top scholars in Jiangsu Province, namely Huang Siyong of Jianning in the Gengchen year, whose style name was Shenzhi, and Zhang Jian of Nantong Prefecture in the Jiawu year, whose courtesy name was Jizhen, neither of whom were from Suzhou.) Lu Runxiang of the Jiasu year was the last of the Suzhou scholars. Lu served as the emperor's teacher with the appearance of a top scholar, and died in the fourth year of the Republic of China. His student Wang Yitang mourned him and said, "The peaches and plums of the public's gate fill the world," "The mourning of the teacher is better than the winning of the imperial court." Yitang is not worth mentioning, and his writing is also mediocre, but this couplet is not bad.
