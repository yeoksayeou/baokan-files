### Fierce Battle Unfolds in Anshan Urban Area; Air Force Assists Garrison in Hand-to-Hand Combat with Bandits; National Army Concentrates in Western Liaoning, Situation Improves

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 19th] After a week of offensive and defensive battles in Anshan, bandits broke into the city on the 18th, immediately launching street fighting. Fierce battles erupted in the Tiexi Steel Smelting Plant, Rail Steel Plant, and various machine casting factories. The fighting reached a climax at night. On the 19th, the Air Force repeatedly flew over the urban area to assist in the battle. The garrison is currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the bandits. Contact was maintained with this location until the afternoon, with the fiercest fighting underway in the evening.

[Another Dispatch] In the Battle of Anshan, the bandits, with a main force or part of it from five columns, namely the Second, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth, totaling about 50,000 troops, began attacking outlying strongholds on the night of the 16th. They then completed the encirclement and bombarded the city with over thirty artillery pieces. After seven days of fierce fighting, the battle has entered its final stage.

[Another Dispatch] Amidst the tense situation in southern Liaoning, a new situation is brewing in western Liaoning. National Army troops are massing in a certain area, and it is widely believed that the situation in the Rehe-Western Liaoning corridor will soon change. Icebreakers are gathering in Huludao and Yingkou (Yingkou has thawed). The National Army in Yingkou is also shelling the ice surface in the harbor to facilitate navigation. The bandits in Liaoyang are showing signs of wavering. Communist bandits are also gathering in Xinmin and Dahushan, with a portion heading south to reinforce Goubangzi. On the 18th, over one column of Communist bandits had gathered between Goubangzi and Beizhen, and they continue to amass. To prevent the National Army from advancing eastward, the Communist bandits intend to strike the Daling River again. The situation along the Daling River has been extremely tense at night in recent days. The National Army between the Daling River and Jinzhou is currently strengthening its defenses. The First and Tenth Columns of bandits and another bandit unit in western Shenyang are now gathering in the Kaiyuan area of northern Shenyang, with intentions to probe Tie嶺.

### Turkish Newspaper Reveals Soviet Conspiracy: Encouraging the Chinese Communists to Seize Shenyang and Establish a Red Capital; Northeast's Seriousness No Less Than Germany and Greece

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 18th] The Turkish Democratic Party's official newspaper, "Power," stated: The Soviet Union's most important expansion plan at present lies in communizing China. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party is plotting to seize Shenyang and make it their red capital. The newspaper continued: If Shenyang falls into the hands of the Communist Party, the entire Northeast of China will be controlled by the Communist Party. Since losing their old base in Yan'an, the Communist Party has not had a fixed capital. Therefore, they are now plotting to establish a new red capital in Shenyang. From our point of view, Germany and Greece seem to be the powder kegs of the Third World War, but we must not forget the China problem. To date, the Communist Party in China has consistently received Soviet equipment more than the aforementioned two countries. Moreover, the Communist Party-controlled areas of China border the Soviet Union, unfortunately making the situation in China even darker than before. The competitive and antagonistic situation created by the United States and the Soviet Union in China is more serious and larger in scale than in any other region of the world. The Soviet Union's support and equipping of the Chinese Communist Party may be the most important item in the Kremlin's foreign expansion plan, its development is serious and affects world peace.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 19th] The National Army in this area is quite uneasy about the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea. According to an official, the Soviet Union will turn Korea into the Yugoslavia of Asia. Both official and unofficial sources deeply believe that this new development may trigger active assistance from Korea to the Chinese Communists, especially in the Northeast, and it is feared that the Chinese Communists may thus acquire an air force.

### Northeast Natives Residing in Peiping Host Ma Zhanshan and Others; Ma Explains Mission to Capital

[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 19th] The Peiping Northeast Native Association hosted Ma Zhanshan and others at the European and American Alumni Association at 2:00 PM on the 19th, with over a hundred people in attendance, including Ma Zhanshan, Xing'an Chairman Wu Huanzhang, and Ma Yi. During the gathering, in addition to Ma explaining his mission to the capital upon summons, he also responded to the request of fellow Northeast natives to present three points to the central government: (1) Expedite the increase of troops and restore civilian armed forces; (2) Increase food sources; (3) Improve the Northeast economy and stabilize the exchange rate between circulating certificates and legal tender. Ma also stated that he would not return north if his objectives were not achieved in the capital. He reviewed the reasons for the failure in the Northeast, stating that the military and civilians could not cooperate. To save the Northeast in the future, it is necessary to organize the people and take root in the Northeast. Finally, he emphasized that without the Northeast, there is no North China; without North China, there is no China, his words were extremely impassioned.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 19th] General Ma Zhanshan told the Associated Press exclusively on the 9th that 300,000 of his old troops were "stranded" in the uninhabited areas of the Northeast. If the government were to arm them, he was prepared to lead these 300,000 men to fight the Communist bandits in their homeland. He said that if the Northeast National Army could hold out for "two or three months," he could equip and organize his troops within that time, and this plan could change the situation in the Northeast. He also said that the Communist Party's rear today is under the control of the Northeast landlords. After being purged by the Communist Party, they united and fought for survival as Red Beards, but they are not really Red Beards. "Their total number is between 300,000 and 500,000. If the government reaches out, they will all submit."

We have the convenience of railway transport, and the bandits will be severely attacked if they come.

### The Difference Between the Policies of the Nationalists and the Communists: Wu Tiecheng Refutes British Newspaper Commentary

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 19th] Last week's editorial in the London Times commented on the policies of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, stating that there was not much difference. The newspaper believes that the policies of both parties seek one-party dictatorship, cannot escape the implications of nationalism, and are unwilling to have a democratic political system. The only difference lies in the class interests they represent and the different people who support them. A Central News Agency reporter visited Wu Tiecheng regarding this matter and asked him to comment. (Continued on page 2, column 1)

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese Technical Advisory Group, said that President Truman's message to Congress on aid to China was "good in scope." After arriving here, he submitted China's recommendations to the State Department for reference. When asked if he was satisfied with this, Bei replied, "Yes, and no." Bei was unwilling to explain the content of his recommendations to the State Department, only saying that the amount of aid proposed by Truman was not as much as China wanted. When asked if the amount proposed by Truman was sufficient to achieve its designated goals, Bei replied, "No amount is too large for China, the current amount only satisfies part of our hope." When asked if the amount proposed by Truman could be satisfactory to China's needs, Bei replied, "It depends on how the detailed measures are implemented." Bei also stated that his recommendations to the State Department involved reforming China's monetary system, but he was unwilling to express his opinion on Truman's failure to mention this matter.

### Bridges Urges Military Aid to China; Believes President's Plan "Inadequate"

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] After President Truman requested Congress on the 18th to pass a limited economic aid to China plan of $570 million, Republican spokesmen immediately criticized the plan as "inadequate" because it did not include military assistance. The President acknowledged in his special message that his recommendations could do no more than delay China's economic disintegration, and carefully avoided requesting military assistance for Chairman Chiang in the anti-Communist civil war. This omission was severely criticized by Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Bridges is the strongest proponent in Congress for military and economic aid to China. He said: China's post-war difficulties have gone beyond the scope that economic aid can reverse. He urged people to pay attention to General Wedemeyer, former presidential envoy, who strongly urged his Appropriations Committee to provide Chairman Chiang with military supplies. He said: "If the United States allows China to fall into the hands of the Communists due to negligence during the same period, then the billions of dollars spent to prevent the spread of communism in Europe will be meaningless." Bridges continued: The United States should send a strong and direct representative to protect its interests in Nanjing.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Former Republican Congressman from New York, Fish, suggested on the 18th that Allied Commander MacArthur should fly back to Washington soon to testify in favor of aid to China. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee: "If our aid to China is delayed until half a year, until June, it will be too late to be effective."

### Ambassador Stuart's Letter to the Chinese People: Economic Aid to China Provides an Opportunity for Revival, but the Main Strength Still Lies with the Chinese People

[United States Information Service, Nanjing, 18th] United States Ambassador to China, Stuart, issued a letter to the Chinese people this afternoon. The full text is as follows:

You have learned from President Truman's statement to Congress that the United States intends to help the Chinese people. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to explain to you the various objectives that determine the United States' policy toward China and the problems it raises. Because I was born in your country, grew up in your country, and am no less concerned about your country's welfare than you are, I would like to try to explain it from this standpoint.

Fortunately, what the United States government and people expect of China is also what all sincere patriotic Chinese people are now striving for: China's freedom and independence, domestic peace and prosperity, and the establishment of a truly modern democratic government. This is all that we Americans expect.

The common goal is how to help the civilians who have suffered the most from the civil war since the victory of the War of Resistance. What they ask for is to enjoy peace and engage in productive activities under a government that cares about their welfare.

Specifically, the focus of the problem is to improve the welfare of the general public and protect them from the threats of extreme reactionary selfish elements and extreme radical violent revolutionary means. Both of these groups are well-organized, and both believe that party and personal interests are far more important than the interests of the poor people.

We Americans believe in democracy and believe that if the time is right and there is enough time, democracy will surely prevail in China. From a negative point of view, a democratic government can guarantee the people's freedom in their daily lives and freedom from fear. From a positive point of view, it can also create an environment in which wiser and more progressive leaders can educate and assist ordinary citizens in many ways to understand their obligations and rights in a democratic life, and put it into practice in accordance with the spirit of the rule of law, without following personal preferences, and through constitutional procedures. According to the lessons of Chinese history, the masses are willing to follow wise leaders who they trust and who have good character. If the old Chinese democratic methods are used as modern constitutional procedures, then the corruption or incompetence in the national, provincial, and local governments can be gradually eliminated, and replaced by people who are freely elected by the people to perform public duties for the public good.

I have been with Chinese students for a long time, so I deeply understand their patriotic ideals. Whether they have graduated, served in the government, engaged in education, run businesses, held other jobs, or are still studying at school, they should lead by example in this patriotic work. With their selfless example, they will be able to overcome the other extreme of only knowing how to be loyal to the party, not tolerating other political beliefs, using violent means, attempting to destroy public and private property, and inflicting the terror of robbery and war on innocent people in order to achieve their tyrannical goals.

We Americans, under the leadership of Mr. Marshall, have done our best to prevent the development of the current situation and the suffering it has caused to the Chinese people. However, in view of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples and the firm belief that the economic welfare of the Chinese people will promote world happiness, we intend to use the Economic Aid to China Plan to give the Chinese government and people another opportunity to begin building China's economic revival and stability.

But the responsibility for the work, at its core, still lies with the Chinese people themselves. No matter how much material assistance the United States provides and how many expert advisors there are, it will not be enough to meet the needs of China's political stability and economic revival. The main strength is still the Chinese people, and there must also be a sincere determination to sacrifice oneself for the benefit of the public.

The meaning of freedom and democracy should not be misunderstood, but now it has been confused by various interpretations. Under a totalitarian system, there is no possibility of freedom of thought. Anyone who intends to think freely will either be controlled or purged.

A democratic government is not only a government for the people but also a government by the people. In this democratic spirit, the people should constantly supervise the government with enlightened public opinion to prevent officials from abusing their power. Therefore, there must be freedom of speech and publication, and freedom to freely interview or fairly report news. In the works of a totalitarian system, these freedoms cannot exist. On the contrary, the news becomes a tool of scientific propaganda, using infinite slander and repeated disregard for the truth to extend its efficacy.

The dangers facing China today can only be overcome by the joint efforts of all selfless citizens. For this, there must be vision, courage, and determination. We hope that China's patriotic elements who are loyal to freedom, together with all sectors of the country, will take constructive and gradual steps to promote the unity and peaceful progress of the entire country.

U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart.

There are No Currency Loan Negotiations Between China and the United States

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Ambassador Stuart held a press conference at his official residence at 3:40 p.m. on the 19th, releasing his "Letter to the Chinese People" in his personal capacity and answering reporters' questions. He said that 510 million of the loan to China could be used to purchase important materials such as food, fuel, and machinery, while the other 60 million would be used for selected construction projects, but it was not specified that it must be used for the restoration of the Yuehan Railway. As for the purchase of military equipment, it is not within the scope of this loan. However, if China has sufficient financial resources, it can purchase the imported goods that it urgently needs. Ambassador Stuart affirmed that there are currently no negotiations between China and the United States regarding loans for the stabilization or reform of China's currency system.

### Agricultural Loans Will Be Opened Ahead of Schedule

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The person in charge of the Four Joint Offices said: The Four Joint Council will reconvene on the 21st, and the issue of opening up loans can be decided. Agricultural loans are now imminent and can be processed ahead of schedule. Zhang Jia'ao will report on the agricultural loan plan at the meeting. The date of opening up industrial loans has not yet been decided.

[Another cable] Supervisors Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, Li Xiaoting, and others have made suggestions to the government regarding the opening up of loans for legitimate industry and commerce, advocating that in order to maintain the survival of legitimate industry and commerce, industrial loans should be opened up conditionally, but after the loans are opened, efforts should be made to avoid the abuses of past loans.

The world-renowned U.S. aid to China plan was finally submitted to Congress by President Truman on the 18th of this month. This presidential message, which is thousands of words long, is a historical document, whether in terms of Sino-U.S. relations or Far Eastern peace. We have repeatedly read the full text of the message and summarized the main points of the entire article as follows: (1) Emphasize the sincere friendship between China and the United States, and express sympathy for the difficulties and tests that China has suffered over the years; (2) Request Congress to approve $570 million as the aid to China plan before June 30, 1949; (3) To implement this aid to China plan, China and the United States should sign an agreement, which will be subject to various conditions; (4) If the United States believes that the assistance it provides is not being handled in accordance with the agreement, or if the United States believes that the Chinese government's policies are not in line with the U.S. use of assistance to help it achieve economic self-sufficiency, then the United States will naturally reserve the right to stop assistance; (5) Although the U.S. aid to China plan is the best way for the United States to take at present, China's revival still depends entirely on its own self-help.

After reading President Truman's message, our first feeling is that the U.S. policy toward China, whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, whether it is the late President Roosevelt or the current President Truman, or even the future Democratic Party president, is consistent in principle, with only slight differences in emphasis and urgency. Before President Truman proposed this aid to China plan, everyone saw that the U.S. aid to China was all talk and no action, and they could not help but feel disappointed. Therefore, many people who had a half-baked understanding of the United States speculated about President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, saying that the U.S. foreign policy was "silent first and then Asian," or that the United States intended to support Japan in the Far East to counter the Soviet Union. Now that we have seen President Truman's message, we can completely understand it. President Truman not only cherishes the sincere friendship between China and the United States, but also deeply sympathizes with China's unfortunate experiences in recent years. At the same time, he recognizes China's greatness, not only because it is a vast country with a large population, but also because it has a long history and culture and has become an important factor in international relations. China's stability, strength, and progress are of great importance to the security and peace of the Pacific and the world. President Truman's understanding of China can represent the common view of the U.S. government and the public, which makes us more confident that no matter what the outcome of this year's general election, even if President Truman fails to be re-elected and the leader of another party becomes the master of the White House, the U.S. aid to China policy will not change. Therefore, we cannot but express our gratitude for President Truman's good intentions, and it is only reasonable that we should no longer have any dissatisfaction.

However, if we put aside theory and talk about the actual effectiveness of this plan, we cannot help but express considerable doubt as to whether President Truman's aid to China plan will be effective and achieve his intended goals. Because President Truman intends to allocate US$570 million within eight years to aid China, the purpose is to give the Chinese government time to breathe in the midst of economic decline, so that it can find ways to establish a more stable economic situation. However, after studying the content and procedures of the U.S. aid to China plan and looking at China's actual situation, although we are not defeatists, we still do not believe that US$570 million is as powerful as a god. What's more, in terms of the amount, the amount of aid to China is only US$57 million. Even if it can be quickly approved by Congress, China will not be able to obtain substantial assistance until after July 1, and it will take a year to obtain the full amount of US$570 million. In view of the urgency of China's needs, the U.S. aid to China plan is not only insufficient, but also too late in terms of time. We really dare not make a hasty judgment on its effectiveness.

In terms of China's current situation, economic difficulties are certainly the most serious problem facing China. President Truman also said in his message: "The Chinese government and people are still suffering from the double pressure of civil war and rapid economic decline. The difficult situation caused by Japan's occupation and blockade during the eight years of the War of Resistance has now been made more serious by internal strife. The continued obstruction and destruction of major transportation routes by the Communist army has further deepened the losses suffered by transportation and production equipment during the War of Resistance." However, we still cannot but tell President Truman and the U.S. government and the public that China's current problems are not only economic problems, but also military and political problems, which are mutually causal with economic problems. If we do not understand the truth of the matter and want to treat the symptoms but not the root cause, it will not be the way a good doctor treats a disease. President Truman also said: "The United States is extremely concerned about the continued economic decline in China; we hope that the environment in China will enable U.S. assistance to be effective and used in a constructive way for construction and reconstruction. We may be able to help China alleviate the current economic decline, so that the Chinese government has another opportunity to take the necessary steps to establish a more stable economic environment." If U.S. aid to China is limited to this and no other steps are taken, then President Truman will be greatly disappointed. Therefore, Republican members of Congress pointed out that President Truman's aid to China plan did not include military aid and unanimously pointed out that this plan was "insufficient." For example, the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bai Liqi, said: "China's difficulties after the war have exceeded the scope that economic aid can reverse the overall situation."

However, the United States is a democratic country, and all domestic and foreign policies must be based on public opinion. President Truman's aid to China plan is still subject to discussion in Congress. If members of Congress have opinions, they can not only express them freely, but also amend and supplement them. What's more, the amount of US$570 million specified by President Truman is also a provisional number, which can be increased at any time. We hope that the members of the U.S. Congress will recognize the seriousness of the situation in China and urge the government to step up the work of aiding China at any time, especially to assist China in reforming its currency system.

Finally, we still have to say a few words to the Chinese government. President Truman's aid to China plan has been proposed. Judging from the political atmosphere in Washington these days, it will undoubtedly be approved by both the House and the Senate. It can also be asserted that the amount of aid to China will only increase and will not decrease. We should certainly know how to be grateful for the continuous assistance from the United States, but the most important thing is not to forget the basic national policy of "self-help": we must never have the slightest dependence on foreign aid. During the War of Resistance, let alone, just take the period after the victory as an example, the U.S. aid has been flowing in continuously, and it cannot be said that it is not much, but we have not been able to use this precious assistance as a starting point for national construction and revival. This is really a major mistake in our country, which has disappointed our friendly countries and led foreigners to criticize us for being corrupt and incompetent. The past cannot be changed, but the future can be pursued. We must change the past political style, work hard to govern, rely on our own efforts, and make good use of this precious U.S. aid. Whether it is materials or U.S. dollars, we must use it completely for the revival of our country's economy, and we must not waste a single bit. We must know that only "self-help" can make U.S. aid effective!

### Content of U.S. Aid to China Proposal

(Continued from the previous page) Section 4 A The President may provide aid to China in the form or procedure prescribed in Section 3 without requiring reimbursement, or may make loans in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Section B. The National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems will serve as the President's advisor when the President decides whether such assistance is without reimbursement or is in the form of a loan, and determines the term of such loans. Whether any assistance given to China for the purpose of achieving the objectives of this Act should require China to repay, whether it should be repaid in money or other consideration, and if so required, what the conditions should be, will depend on China's ability to repay without jeopardizing the completion of the objectives of this Act? Assuming that it is decided that China can only be required to repay a portion of the assistance under this Act, then, where practicable, the prices specified in Section 3, paragraph A, clause (1), subparagraph 2 should be used as repayment.

B When it is decided to provide assistance in the form of a loan under the provisions of this Act, the President shall allocate to the Export-Import Bank of Washington the funds to be used for this purpose. The Bank, without being bound by the provisions of the Export-Import Bank Act (Public Law 59-529), as amended in 1945, shall extend and manage loans in accordance with the President's guidance and the terms prescribed. The administrative expenses necessarily incurred by the Export-Import Bank in handling such loans may be reimbursed. The Bank shall deposit in the U.S. Treasury all odd sums received from the repayment of principal and interest on such loans.

Loans extended by the Export-Import Bank of Washington with funds allocated to the Bank by the President shall not be counted in determining whether the Bank's principal loans and guarantees have reached the prescribed limits at any time, as determined under Section 7 of the Export-Import Bank Act (Public Law 59-529), as amended in 1945.

Section 5 Before any assistance may be made available to China under the powers under this Act, an agreement shall be entered into between China and the United States, subject to the restrictions and provisions of this Act, in which China shall provide guarantees to achieve the objectives of this Act, to improve commercial relations with China, and such other guarantees as the President may deem necessary.

A Effective use of any materials authorized under this Act, and the pricing and terms of distribution of such materials, shall be based on the principle of promoting the objectives of this Act.

B To the extent possible, initiate financial, monetary, budgetary and administrative measures to create a more stable currency situation and to enhance China's ability to achieve economic self-reliance.

C When any materials or services are provided to China by any means interfered with by this Act other than on a payment basis, an equivalent amount of Chinese legal tender shall be entered in a special account under terms agreed upon by the Governments of China and the United States. This special account, together with the unused portion of the deposits made by China in accordance with Section 6 of the Resolution on Relief to the Peoples of War-Affected Countries (Public Law 84, 80th Congress), must be reserved for the purposes agreed upon by the Governments of China and the United States, and the balance remaining on this account on June 30, 1949 must be used in China for purposes agreed upon by the Governments of China and the United States, and approved by this Act or the Joint Resolution.

D At least every quarter after the date of the agreement, a complete list of all actions taken by the Government of China under the agreement shall be published, including the use of funds, materials and services obtained under this Act, and such list shall be transmitted to the United States.

E Promptly provide relevant reports at the request of the United States to assist the United States in determining the nature and scope of future actions under this Act.

R Use all media in China (including government wireless) to continuously publish reports to inform the ultimate consumer of the use, source, nature and quantity of all materials authorized under this Act.

G Materials provided under the authority of this Act shall not be exported or permitted to be transported from China without the consent of the U.S. Government.

H Strive to obtain the highest possible production and distribution of local products; no measures shall be taken to sell, distribute or use materials included under this Act that are sufficient to reduce the supply of local products or to reduce the sources of supply from countries other than the United States.

I Permit representatives of the U.S. Government, including congressional committees approved by the House or Senate, and representatives of U.S. newspapers and radio stations, to observe and report on the distribution and use of commodities obtained under this Act and the special items prescribed in Section G of this section.

J Facilitate the sale of materials to the United States for stockpiling purposes, at mutually agreeable times and on reasonable terms. Such materials are those needed due to a lack of or possible lack of resources in the United States itself; at the same time, such materials are also available in China after proper estimation of reasonable demand for domestic use and commercial export to China.

### The Difference Between the Policies of the Kuomintang and the Communists (Continued from the previous page)

Mr. Wu said first that the newspaper mistakenly believed that the Kuomintang's one-party rule in the past 20 years was the same as the Communist Party's class dictatorship, which obviously ignored the propositions and efforts of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the creator of the Kuomintang.

Mr. Wu also said that although there were Communist rebellions and Japanese aggression in the past 20 years, the Kuomintang never relaxed its preparations for the implementation of democratic politics in the midst of internal and external troubles. Before the war, the National Assembly Hall was already built in Nanjing, and during the war, the National Assembly Hall was also built in Chongqing. This alone is enough to prove that the Kuomintang will never regard one-party dictatorship as a rule. The Communist Party, however, is unwilling to participate in the National Assembly, opposes the Constitution, and does not allow the existence of opposition parties.

Mr. Wu finally pointed out that The Times published a report from its Beijing correspondent last Wednesday, in which it described the Communist Party's tyranny in China, saying that "the Communist Party only seeks to control the lives of all the people with a one-party class dictatorship, even to the extent of the people's family private lives." This practical observation is a perfect explanation of the difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang.

### 苏澄虞镇等地 米价涨风未战

[Our Suzhou, 19th dispatch] The rice market here has not calmed down from the price surge. Today, all stalls have raised prices by 20,000 yuan. The head of the Social Affairs Section of the county government is stationed in the market all day to oversee transactions. However, the grain merchants turn a blind eye, continuing to whisper and trade on the black market. County Magistrate Wang Jiefo has returned to the city from Chenmu, where he was leading the suppression of bandits. Concerned about the people's food supply, he has decided to go to the rice market tomorrow morning to summon the grain merchants for a reprimand and thoroughly investigate the black market situation.

[Our Jiangyin, 19th dispatch] Due to the high prices in the Wuxi market, the rice industry has delayed opening for business. The off-market price is over 2 million yuan. The county government implemented emergency measures on the 19th, setting a price limit of 1.7 million yuan for white rice and limiting each person to one dou (a unit of dry measure). Officials have been dispatched to investigate everywhere. However, grain merchants claim a lack of reserves and hope to open up supply sources in order to stabilize prices.

[Our Changshu, 19th dispatch] The rice price surge here is quite fierce. The market remained deadlocked and unopened on the 19th, and the black market even exceeded the 2.2 million yuan mark. The county government is making efforts to suppress the rise and will, if necessary, sell off accumulated grain to curb it.

[Our Zhenjiang, 19th dispatch] Price fluctuations in Zhenjiang are severe. Foreign indica rice opened at 2.1 million yuan today. Bean oil is 54,000 yuan per jin (a unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kg). Sugar and foreign sundry goods continue to rise in price. Furthermore, the Zhenjiang Price Evaluation Council has recently approved an increase in pork prices to 46,000 yuan per jin and bean oil to 52,000 yuan per jin.

[Our Bengbu, 19th dispatch] After the Bengbu grain market opened, grain prices suddenly surged wildly, causing public unrest and chaos. Long-grain rice is now knocking on the 4 million yuan mark. Wheat is at 3.75 million yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure) due to frenzied buying by flour mills, leading to an easing of credit. Flour prices have soared as a result, currently at 960,000 yuan per bag. The black market is rampant, and the prices of all other goods are soaring.

[Our Hankou, 19th dispatch] The rice price surge has not been curbed. San Tong machine-milled rice remains high, reaching 2.7 million yuan.

[Our Guangzhou, 19th dispatch] Grain prices here soared wildly all day on the 18th, breaking through the 2 million yuan mark per 100 market jin (a unit of weight). Prices of all goods are skyrocketing, creating a truly terrifying situation.

### 穗市场骚动

私校学费二千亿 纷购金钞起风浪

[Our Guangzhou, 19th dispatch] Due to the financial fluctuations in Shanghai and the impact of the current situation, turmoil has broken out again in the market here. The Hong Kong dollar has risen even more frantically, jumping from 337 to the 400 mark. Gold has also risen from 1,170 to 1,380. The prices of other goods have generally increased by 50 percent. According to Gao Fang, director of the Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau, this phenomenon is entirely caused by psychological factors. He recently received unconfirmed information that yesterday, the 18th, various private primary and secondary schools used the 200 billion yuan in tuition fees they had collected to purchase gold and foreign currency for storage in order to avoid losses, leading to a market where demand exceeds supply. He stated that he will thoroughly investigate this matter. He also stated that the bureau's research results after 50 days of operation in the Guangzhou financial market are: (A) Guangzhou is actually a receiving and payment port rather than a place for investment, so it provides no assistance to industry and commerce. (B) Credit is scarce, with daily bill exchanges totaling less than 500, in stark contrast to the expansion of credit in Shanghai. (C) The Hong Kong dollar's damage to the national currency is particularly severe. Industry and commerce are entirely based on the Hong Kong dollar, and the national currency has been relegated to the status of a subsidiary currency. The future is truly unimaginable. The bureau is currently addressing these issues to improve the situation.

### 韩故师表 遗属惨剧

家无积蓄恤金渺茫 长子韩永涵突自杀

[Our Beiping, 19th dispatch] Han Yonghan, the 15-year-old eldest son of Han Zengdong, the commander of the 88th Division of the 71st Army who died in the Battle of Siping last year, committed suicide with a pistol yesterday. Yonghan was a sophomore at Huilin High School in Beiping. After his father's death, he was extremely grief-stricken. Furthermore, the family had no savings, and there was no news of the only source of support, the pension. His mother had published an announcement in the Ta Kung Pao, questioning Chen Mingren, titled "General Chen Mingren, Please Take Note," which read: "We have received a letter from the adjutant's office of the current 71st Army stating that the pension for the late commander Han Zengdong of the former 88th Division was received during your tenure. We are unsure how this pension was handled and are extremely perplexed. If you are preserving it on our behalf, it has been more than half a year, and we are afraid that you are overburdened. We are sincerely grateful. Furthermore, the government provides pensions to commemorate heroes and support their families, not to be used for other purposes. Although we are orphans and widows, we are still capable of managing it ourselves and dare not presume upon your authority. We hereby publish this announcement to express our sincere thanks and request a reply as soon as possible." It was signed "Han Cao Lanfang." Many days passed without a response. Yonghan, already grieving his father's death, felt the hardship of the family's life and suddenly became disillusioned with life, committing suicide with a Browning pistol. The bullet entered from his right chest, but because the bullet was small, it did not exit. He was discovered and sent to Peking University Hospital, but he died due to excessive blood loss. Han's wife, Cao Lanfang, has two sons and three daughters. Yonghan was the eldest. Although young, he acted like an adult. Last year, he went to welcome his father's spirit in Panjin and did not sleep for three days and nights, suffering a mental blow. Today, he finally committed suicide due to grief and his circumstances, a truly tragic event.

Air Force Tiger General: The Death of Gao Youxin

At 3:35 PM on February 13, "a great star fell on the railroad tracks east of Wuhu Bridge in Nanjing—a magnificent air hero, silently extinguished the sparks of life under the wheels of a train!

This is the tragedy of Gao Youxin. In the Air Force, Gao Youxin represents a respectable name. He was only 32 years old this year. Ever since he dedicated himself to the Air Force at the age of 19, he has always been the pride of the Air Force. He admired Gao Zhihang and was also known as "Little Gao Zhihang." He was brave, alert, passionate, and straightforward. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he created the most glorious record in the history of the Chinese Air Force: personally destroying over a hundred enemy aircraft, accumulating 275 combat merits, and receiving as many as 15 medals. He can be called a tiger general! After the victory, he did not rest and continued to sweep away the evil atmosphere for the motherland. He did not die in the sky fighting enemy bandits, but he died in an improper place, which is a great pity.

Gao Youxin was born in a middle-class family in Jin County, Liaoning Province. He lost his father early and was raised by his widowed mother and his uncle, Gao Yongen. His mother was a devout Christian, and the spirit of Jesus's love influenced him in his youth. When the Battle of Gubeikou broke out in 1935 and Tianjin and Beiping were threatened, he had just graduated from the Tianjin Rotary Club Middle School and resolved to join the Air Force, believing that the Air Force was the best way to serve the country. He was only 19 years old at that time. Because he loved sports in school, he was very strong. On July 1 of that year, the Air Force Officer School recruited eighth-term students in Tianjin, and he was admitted in one fell swoop. On September 1, he enlisted in Nanjing for training. By August 1936, he was receiving elementary flight training at the Guangzhou Branch School. In April 1937, he was receiving advanced flight training in Jianqiao, Hangzhou. That year, on August 13, the Shanghai Battle broke out. Jianqiao Aviation School first moved to Nanchang, Jiangxi, then to Xiaogan, Hubei, and then to Liuzhou, Guangxi. In November, it arrived in Kunming to receive advanced flight training. He was flying a fighter plane, receiving training on one hand and serving on the other. On September 24, 1938, Japanese planes bombed Kunming for the first time. He had not yet graduated, but he flew a Hawk 3 fighter plane into the air to meet the enemy, demonstrating excellent performance and making a name for himself.

On December 1, 1938, he officially graduated from aviation school and was transferred to the Lanzhou Fighter Training Corps for training. In 1939, he was assigned to Chongqing as a second lieutenant in the Fourth Group. The Fourth Group was founded by Gao Zhihang and was also known as the "Zhihang Group." Gao Youxin, who was full of heroism, often expressed his ambition to others: "To be the second Gao Zhihang—"

He did not fail his ambition. Later facts proved that he was as great as Gao Zhihang; and summing up Youxin's life achievements, he even surpassed Zhihang. He always charged forward in every battle, making the enemy tremble with fear. In 1940, he was promoted to first lieutenant squad leader of the 21st Squadron of the Fourth Group, responsible for defense in Lanzhou. On one occasion, when enemy planes launched a large-scale attack, he piloted a Russian-made E15-3 fighter plane and shot down as many as three enemy planes, establishing a special merit. The name Gao Youxin became familiar to people all over the country.

In 1941, he was promoted to captain deputy squadron leader of the 21st Squadron due to meritorious service. He returned to Chongqing from Lanzhou to participate in the Battle of Defense of Greater Chongqing. On March 1 of that year, the enemy began using Zero fighter planes, which were superior in performance to the E15 and E16 models used by our country. Therefore, that period was when our Air Force was at its greatest disadvantage. Gao Youxin was wounded in an air battle on one occasion.

In 1942, the Fourth Group went to Kunming and then to India to receive American training, using the latest P-40 fighter planes, turning the disadvantage into an advantage and forcing the enemy's Zero fighters to dare not show their faces. At this time, Fu Youxin was already the captain of the 22nd Squadron of the Fourth Group, fighting alongside the American 14th Air Force led by Chennault, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces north and south of the Yellow River.

Gao Youxin was promoted to major deputy group leader of the Fourth Group in 1943. On one occasion, while flying a plane to bomb the enemy forces in Henan, he was hit by enemy artillery fire and had to parachute once. Unfortunately, he parachuted into a communist-controlled area. At that time, the communists were still ostensibly "cooperating." However, the "cooperation" involved presenting conditions to the Air Force Headquarters, requiring a large sum of money as the price for allowing him to be redeemed. He was held under house arrest there for three months before returning to Chongqing.

He was injured three times and parachuted three times in his life. He always turned misfortune into good fortune.

Gao Youxin, who was young and had a great reputation, had a very tragic love life. In the spring of 1939, he met Ms. Liu Moran, a top student at Southwest Associated University. Ms. Liu was revered as the "Queen" at the university. Hero and beauty, love at first sight. In the summer of 1942, the wedding was held at the Lixing Society in Chengdu, and the guests gathered together, and many people envied them—but the creator is jealous, and more than two months after the wedding, the bride died of tuberculous meningitis. In addition to the grief of the groom, he disappeared from the entertainment venues and devoted all his fiery enthusiasm to his work. On the eve of victory in 1945, the United States invented the faster P-15 fighter plane, which was used to sweep through the enemy forces shaking in the north and south of the Yangtze River, and was invincible. This was the most prosperous era of our Air Force.

Victory! The whole country rejoiced. Gao Youxin welcomed the glory of victory and held his second wedding in Chongqing. The other party was Ms. He Lingling, a 17-year-old girl from Hunan, who was the granddaughter of He Jian, a member of the Central Committee. Soon after, the Fourth Group moved from Chongqing to Beiping, and the new couple visited the ancient capital together. In the winter of that year, the communist bandit He Long's troops launched a large-scale attack on Suiyuan and Baotou. Gao Youxin fought in the air and made another great contribution. Because of his bravery in combat, when the communist bandits in the Northeast launched a large-scale attack in the spring of 1946, the Northeast also needed him. He then went from Beiping to Shenyang. This time, Mrs. Gao did not go with him, and the tragedy was planted there!

### 共产势力企图控制希腊 美决不袖手坐视 马歇尔顾问特发出警告 必要时将考虑派遣武装部队赴希

[United Press, Louisville, 18th dispatch] Henderson, Secretary of State Marshall's senior advisor on Greek affairs, warned the Soviet Union and its satellite countries on the 18th that the United States would not stand idly by and allow Greece to fall victim to international communism. US officials went on to state that, if necessary, they would consider sending their own armed forces to Greece. He reported that the Administration would soon request Congress for greater military assistance to Greece and strongly implied that financial assistance alone would not be enough. He stated that communist guerrillas commit the most outrageous and even obscene acts every day. Unless these guerrillas are eliminated in the near future, the Marshall Plan will fail in Greece and be seriously threatened throughout Europe.

[Reuters, Washington, 18th dispatch] Washington observers believe that Mr. Han's words are nothing less than a warning to Moscow and the Balkan countries that if they support the guerrillas in Greece, the US government will make equal efforts to support the Athens regime. Henderson also stated: "The United States will not stand idly by when foreign aggressors deprive Greece of its territorial integrity and political independence."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall declared today that President Truman will decide on the amount of increased aid to Greece and Turkey before the 20th and will travel to Florida soon, but Marshall refused to disclose details of the issue.

[Associated Press, Thessaloniki, 19th dispatch] Greek military authorities announced today that they have obtained evidence proving that guerrillas have been ordered to detain personnel of the UN Permanent Observer Corps and treat them as prisoners of war.

### 对巴勒斯坦分治问题 美立场大体决定 英重申不参加执行任务

[United Press, Washington, 18th dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall warned that the effectiveness and even the existence of the United Nations depends on decisive action on the issue of the partition of Palestine. He declined to specify what action he believed the United Nations should take, but said that the US position was largely determined and that the US representative would present it when the Security Council begins debating the Palestinian issue. He confirmed that the US ban on the shipment of weapons to the Holy Land was under consideration, but would not be implemented.

[Reuters, London, 18th dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin told MPs in the House of Commons that the defense of the city of Jerusalem was the responsibility of the UN organization, not the British government. He also reiterated that British troops would not participate in the implementation of the Palestine Partition Plan or any solution not jointly accepted by Jews and Arabs.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th dispatch] British Colonial Secretary Jones told reporters here today that he expected the unrest in the Holy Land to worsen after Britain ends its mandate over Palestine on May 15. At that time, the Arabs will use force more openly to resist the partition. Jones also said that a widespread civil war would have broken out in Palestine long ago without British security forces stationed there. Britain has been striving to avoid conflict between Jews and Arabs from a position of impartiality. Britain has not been able to accept all the requests made by the United Nations to it because it must handle the important task of withdrawing from the Holy Land itself. The two main points that Britain cannot accept from the UN organization are the opening of Jewish immigration ports and the date of the UN Committee's arrival in the Holy Land. Britain is well aware that the opening of immigration ports will lead to more serious civil war. Asked whether Britain accepted the principle of needing international forces to implement the partition, Jones replied that he had warned the UN organization in October last year that the Arabs would oppose the partition, so the use of force to implement the partition was extremely necessary. Therefore, if the UN organization has the determination to implement its resolutions, it must be given appropriate military equipment. This matter should now be decided by the Security Council.

### 托管理事会讨论 耶城设国际市

伊拉克代表中途退席

[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th dispatch] Iraqi representative Qari Di protested the plan to make Jerusalem an international zone at the UN Trusteeship Council today. He considered the UN General Assembly's plan to be illegal, and that the plan was only a suggestion, so it had no binding effect. If the Trusteeship Council proceeds to implement the plan, it will be a violation of the Charter and an infringement of the rights of stakeholders. He also pointed out the following points: (1) The UN Charter does not provide for a trusteeship system for Jerusalem; (2) Britain, as the mandatory power, has not submitted a trusteeship agreement; (3) The General Assembly therefore has no right to propose a trusteeship agreement; (4) The Trusteeship Council itself cannot be the trustee; the Trusteeship Council can only be the supervisor, and the trustee must be one or more countries. He believed that the Trusteeship Council has no right to deal with the plan of the international city of Jerusalem. The Iraqi delegation could not participate in this discussion, stated and then exited the meeting.

### U.S. Representative Arrives in England to Attend Three-Power Conference

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] The U.S. Ambassador to England, Douglas, and the U.S. representatives attending the London Three-Power Conference on the German problem, all arrived here by plane from Washington today.

[Reuters, London, 19th] Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to meet with U.S. Ambassador to England, Douglas, today to discuss whether or not to include the Benelux countries in the Anglo-American-French discussions on the German problem. The Benelux countries all hope to fully participate in this conference, but British officials are opposed to their participation. If the Benelux countries are not invited, the realization of the Western European Union plan will inevitably suffer a blow. London officials revealed that the issue of whether or not these three countries will participate will not be decided before the Three-Power Conference convenes on Monday.

### U.S. Foreign Aid Plan to Be Handled by Consolidated Agency

### U.S. Bans Export of Old Weapons and Ammunition

State Department Stops Issuing Export Licenses

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The State Department has announced a ban on the export from the United States of any ordnance, ammunition, or war materiel that has been sold by the government as scrap. The State Department's announcement stated: Before World War II, and during the period between the wars, individuals and companies in the United States sold weapons, ammunition, and war materiel that had been used in World War I and sold as scrap to foreign countries, placing the U.S. government in an extremely awkward position. In order to avoid a similar situation arising from the war materiel of World War II, the State Department has decided to no longer issue export licenses for any ordnance, ammunition, and war materiel that has been sold by the government as scrap.

### Declaration by Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia: West German Plans Threaten Security; Advocate Continued Four-Power Control of Germany

[Reuters, Prague, 18th] The foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia issued a declaration after a two-day meeting in Prague, protesting the unilateral solution being pursued in western Germany, stating that a West Germany as a separate political entity undermines the foundation of European security. The declaration also stated that dividing Germany is detrimental to its neighbors and also to Germany's peaceful progress. The declaration further protested the priority given to Germany in the Marshall Plan for reconstruction, demanded the fulfillment of the reparations claims of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, and solemnly warned that Germany has transformed from a center of chaos into a new tool of aggression. The three foreign ministers also decided to continue exchanging information and opinions on the German question.

The full text of the declaration, which is two thousand words long, states that the three countries share completely identical views on all issues concerning Germany. The development of the situation in Germany has deviated from the principles stipulated in Potsdam and Yalta, and Germany's recognition of these principles is a necessary condition for achieving peace in Europe. The division of Europe into two opposing blocs makes West Germany a tool of power politics and encourages the revival of disguised German nationalism and militarism. Such phenomena may become the source of the first attack on Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, and ultimately on the entire Europe. The governments of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia solemnly protest the violation of Allied obligations and actions taken without the approval of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and demand the full implementation of the provisions of the Potsdam and Yalta agreements regarding the exchange of views between the great powers and other Allied nations on the exercise of their authority in Germany. While the three governments recognize the importance of restoring Germany's normal economy, they are deeply concerned about the plan to prioritize the reconstruction of Germany at the expense of Western Europe, which could endanger the economy of Western Europe in peacetime. Giving priority to Germany's recovery runs counter to the principles of equality and justice and is intended to establish a West German state with vast military capabilities. The declaration continues, stating that the recent reduction in Czechoslovakia's and Yugoslavia's reparations program is insufficient to compensate for the losses suffered by the two countries due to German aggression. Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia were the first victim countries of Hitler's aggression, and in resolving the German problem, the most important interests of European countries must not be harmed; otherwise, Germany will transform from a center of chaos into a new tool of aggression. The three governments are deeply aware of the cooperation of the Allied nations during the war, acknowledge the contributions of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia in the war, and believe that four-power control of Germany, and consultation with Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia are the surest guarantee of lasting peace and security in Europe. The declaration also called for the punishment of war criminals and the cessation of propaganda by Germans returning to Germany that obstructs peace. Foreign Minister Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, Foreign Minister Modzelewski of Poland, and Foreign Minister Simić of Yugoslavia held a joint press conference to read out the aforementioned declaration. Masaryk also stated that the three governments will informally inform the Western three powers of the results of this meeting.

### North Korea Organizes People's Republic; U.S. Government Still Seeking Confirmation; Marshall Announces at Press Conference

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Marshall stated at a press conference today that, regarding reports of the organization of a People's Republic in North Korea, the U.S. government has not received any information other than what was broadcast by North Korean radio. Therefore, it is currently impossible to confirm the aforementioned report.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] Lieutenant General Dean, U.S. military governor of South Korea, held a press conference at 10:00 a.m. today and answered reporters' questions as follows: (1) Reporter: What are the Governor's thoughts on the establishment of the People's Republic of North Korea? Answer: I have not heard of the official establishment of a government in North Korea. What I have heard is that the People's Committee of North Korea is currently discussing a draft constitution. I believe that North and South Korea must be unified, and must also be unified economically. I hope that in the future, a government including the majority of the Korean people can be established; (2) Reporter: There are reports that Soviet occupation forces are withdrawing from North Korea. Will U.S. forces also withdraw? Answer: I am not an official of the occupation forces and cannot answer this question.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 18th] Menon, chairman of the United Nations Commission on Korea, stated in a broadcast speech in New York last night that he does not believe that North Korea can establish a new government. If it is true, it would be extremely shocking. However, the Korean people cherish independence and will not tolerate such an act that undermines independence.

### Incident of U.S. Officer Being Insulted; Hodge Issues Protest Letter

Says U.S. Forces in South Korea Will Take Action

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 19th] General Hodge, commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, protested to Colonel General Korotkov, commander of Soviet forces in North Korea, yesterday in a letter regarding the intimidation and insult of two U.S. military liaison officers in Pyongyang by Korean police, stating: This is not only a disregard for the representatives he appointed, but also a great insult to the U.S. military. According to reports, this incident occurred on the 8th of this month during a rally of the Korean People's Army in Pyongyang. General Hodge's letter was sent to North Korea on the 18th and involved officials of the North Korean civilian police and the so-called "People's Army." Hodge's letter stated: "At the time, there were several Soviet officers and soldiers who witnessed [the incident] and knew that Your Excellency was responsible for protecting the liaison officers I sent from any violence, yet they did not step forward to intervene. Therefore, I hope that Your Excellency will immediately investigate the actions of the Soviet and Korean military and civilians involved, punish all those responsible, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again." The letter concluded by stating: U.S. forces in South Korea will take appropriate action in response to this.

However, regarding the issue of Ireland's division into two parts, North and South, he hopes it will be resolved as soon as possible in a spirit of understanding and in the interests of both Britain and Ireland. Costello also expressed his hope to strengthen the relationship and goodwill between the United States and Ireland, as the relationship between the United States and Ireland has traditional ties.

### Prosecutor of International Tribunal Says Emperor of Japan Will Not Be Held Liable for War Crimes; Reading of Indictment Against War Criminals Completed

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The prosecutor of the International Tribunal stated this morning when reading his indictment against Japanese war criminals that, according to the old Japanese constitution, the Emperor, who held "all power of the government," is not responsible for war crimes. The Japanese policy of aggression that caused war crimes was proposed, advocated, and established by 25 war criminals. They were the Emperor's advisors and the country's decision-makers.

The prosecutor pointed out that the war criminals themselves have testified in court that the Emperor only acted on the advice of his advisors and was "unable" to oppose the decisions and recommendations on various issues. The prosecution also stated that the power exercised by the Emperor was ultimately used by the war criminals, so the war criminals must bear full responsibility for the war crimes caused by Japan's policy of aggression. U.S. Assistant Prosecutor Horwitz said when reading the general indictment on the responsibilities of the war criminals: None of the war criminals have previously been charged for actions they took directly while in office. The prosecutor said: If the actions of Kenji Doihara and Seishiro Itagaki were only to carry out military attacks in compliance with the orders of the General Staff, then their crimes in China would not have been charged. They are only accused of engaging in activities that incited acts of aggression and caused the Japanese government to adopt aggressive plans. The prosecutor also said: Koki Hirota and Toshio Shiratori may apply to invoke diplomatic immunity, but they are charged entirely because they stopped performing their "diplomatic missions" and led Japan to join the Axis. The prosecutor continued: War criminals can be divided into several categories, some of whom obviously have close relationships with each other, while others do not have significant relationships with each other, but regardless of their differences, they still have one thing in common, that is, they were unanimously engaged in formulating Japan's policy of aggression, which is an "international crime." The prosecutor confirmed the responsibility of the war criminals, saying: If the defendants who held the final political power to formulate Japanese national policy did not provide active support or tacit acquiescence, the war crimes might not have occurred. The prosecution's general indictment began on the 11th of this month and was only completed this morning near noon. The reading of the separate indictments against each war criminal will begin this afternoon for the trial of war crimes.

### Prosecutor Lists Japanese Atrocities in China

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Prosecutors at the Far East International Military Tribunal, when submitting a general indictment on Japanese atrocities this afternoon, said: Japanese officials were fully aware of the Nanjing Massacre, and in fact this was part of the policy implemented by the Japanese government. Although the Japanese government paid close attention to this atrocity, it adopted an indifferent attitude and took no action, so that this matter would not be repeated throughout the war against China. When the prosecutor described in detail the massacres, tortures, rapes, and other unimaginable atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China, the foreign and Japanese people in the audience appeared to be unbearable to hear. Iwane Matsui, the commander of the Japanese army during the Nanjing Massacre, looked uneasy in the defendant's box, his mind seemingly recalling the scene at the time. He frequently bit his fingers to conceal his embarrassment.

### Verdict on Japanese War Criminals to Be Announced Within Seven Weeks

Keenan Speaks After Arriving in Washington

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Chief Prosecutor Keenan of the Far East Tribunal arrived here today from Tokyo. It is said that the verdict on the Japanese war criminals will be announced within seven weeks, and the reasons for the prosecution by the prosecution team are very sufficient. He plans to stay for several weeks and then return to Tokyo to hear the verdict. Keenan declined to speculate on the court's ruling as to whether the Japanese war chiefs would be sentenced to death, saying that it was not his place to comment on the court's actions.

### Antarctic Territory Triangular Dispute: Argentina Issues Strong Statement, United States Still Strictly Neutral

[United Press International, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 18th] Amidst the competition of Argentine, Chilean, and British fleets rushing to the south of Cape Horn to争取 sovereign rights over Antarctic land, Argentine Undersecretary of Technology, Illicoin, officially issued a statement on the 18th, informing European countries that Argentina does not recognize the existence of European colonies or territories in Antarctica. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall previously stated that the American Security Zone stipulated in the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance signed last year does not include the disputed Antarctic region. Illicoin expressed disagreement with Marshall's opinion. At the same time, Chilean President Videla, currently in Antarctica, warned, "Outdated European imperialism, if intending to seize this land through aggression, is tantamount to infringing upon all American nations."

[Associated Press, Santiago, Chile, 18th] Chilean President Videla, disregarding British protests, formally established a second military base in the Southern Ocean today. According to Chilean Chief of Staff Montalva, this move is the initial step in building Chile into a Pacific power.

[Reuters, Santiago, Chile, 18th] The United States continues to maintain a strictly neutral stance on the Antarctic sovereignty dispute between Britain, Chile, and Argentina.

The Sword of the God of War Hangs Over Our Heads

Since we could not expect good performance from the Konoe Cabinet, we certainly could not expect anything more from the Tojo Cabinet, which was formed after October 17th. Tojo had served as Minister of the Army. After becoming Prime Minister, he remained an active-duty army officer. He was a typical Japanese officer, with narrow, rigid, and inflexible thinking. He was stubborn, wishful-thinking (foolish), forceful, and had considerable drive.

The new Japanese Foreign Minister, Togo, was a typical official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Within his profession, he was a good technician, but his views were quite narrow and did not allow for broad observation.

At the same time, I began to notice the urgency in Tojo's attitude towards our talks. Konoe had urged us to quickly accept his conditions, but one of his goals was to use our agreement with him to remain in office. Tojo also wanted to act quickly, but his goal was different from Konoe's. I believed that if an agreement could not be reached, he was prepared to act, which meant initiating war.

This sense of urgency, almost a frantic action, attempted to force us to reach an agreement, giving Tokyo everything it wanted; this sense of urgency continued until the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident. We detected this intention within days of Tojo seizing power. At that time, a telegram from October 21st to Nomura was intercepted, and the translation was delivered to my desk, stating: "Regarding expressing opinions and clarifying our position, our country has said almost everything that can be said. We feel that we have reached a point where, apart from asking the United States to reconsider its views, we cannot take any further positive action. Therefore, we request that at an appropriate time, you or Wakasugi (Counselor of the Japanese Embassy) should directly explain to the United States that our country cannot spend more time discussing these issues."

The Tojo government's sense of urgency continued to increase. On November 3rd, Foreign Minister Togo instructed the former Ambassador to Germany, Kurusu, to come to Washington, clearly to assist Nomura in negotiating with me. We immediately took all possible steps, at the request of the Japanese government, to expedite his flight across the Pacific.

On the same day, Ambassador Grew sent me a telegram with his opinion. He believed that if our negotiations failed, Japan might engage in a self-destructive act of desperation.

In the intercepted telegrams, we discovered a deadline for the first time. Togo stated in his telegram to Nomura on November 5th: "Due to various circumstances, the completion of the signing of all agreements by the 25th of this month is absolutely necessary. I know this is a difficult order, but under the current circumstances, it is an unavoidable order. Please fully understand this point and prevent Japanese-American relations from falling into chaos."

In our view, there was only one explanation: Japan had already set its war machine in motion, and if we did not accept its demands by November 25th, Japan had decided to resort to war.

Therefore, at the U.S. Cabinet meeting on November 7th, I issued a severe warning about the current crisis. In this solemn meeting, the situation in the Far East occupied all of our minds. As usual, the President began the Cabinet meeting by first reviewing the situation himself, and then seeking opinions from appropriate personnel or requesting cabinet members to offer their assessments. But this time, he directly asked me if I had anything to discuss.

I spoke for about fifteen minutes, pointing out the crisis in the entire international situation. I also detailed the progress of our negotiations with the Japanese side.

I concluded, "In my view, the situation is extremely critical. We should watch out for Japanese military attacks at any time and in any place."

After a moment of silence, the President went around and sought the opinions of each cabinet member. They all agreed with my assessment of the crisis.

The Cabinet unanimously agreed that the dangerous situation should be emphasized by senior officials in their speeches so that the people of the whole country could prepare for this development. In the following days, the President, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Undersecretary of State Welles all delivered powerful speeches on this issue.

Although Nomura continued to reiterate Japan's peaceful intentions, the intercepted telegrams sent to my desk told a different story. One of the telegrams, dated November 14th, was sent from Tokyo to the Japanese representative in Shanghai, explaining what might happen in China if our negotiations failed. The telegram stated: "We will completely destroy British and American power in China. We will take over enemy concessions and interests in China (customs and mines)."

On November 15th, Kurusu arrived in Washington. On November 17th, Nomura accompanied Kurusu to my office. In my view, Kurusu seemed to be the opposite of Nomura. Neither his appearance nor his attitude inspired trust or respect. From the beginning, I felt that he was very cunning. From the intercepted telegrams, the information we constantly received, and the analysis of the Japanese attitude in our talks, we already knew Japan's intentions. Therefore, it seemed impossible that Kurusu did not know the Japanese government's plan and his mission when he left Japan. He was sent to Washington with one of two goals: one was to use all possible pressure and enticement to force us to accept Japan's conditions, and the other was, after failing in this regard, to use negotiations to relax us until Japan was ready to complete its attack.

When introducing Kurusu to me, Nomura also handed me a statement from the Japanese government. We had requested the Tojo Cabinet to confirm the points that the Konoe Cabinet had already agreed to. This statement from the Japanese government accepted our request.

After a brief conversation, I accompanied the two envoys across the street to the White House for a meeting with the President. The situation could not be more urgent at this time. Just the day before, Nomura had received a telegram from Tojo confirming the November 25th deadline. We had also intercepted this telegram.

The telegram stated: "According to Your Excellency's opinion, we should patiently wait and see the turn of the war situation. But I am sorry to say that the current situation has made it impossible for us to do so. I have proposed a deadline for settling these negotiations and cannot change it. Please understand this point. You also know how short time is; therefore, do not allow the United States to divert our attention and continue to delay the negotiations. Force them to seek a solution according to our proposal. Please make the greatest effort to facilitate an immediate solution."

Things had become such that we had to sign the document specified by the Japanese side, or else accept all the consequences.

Neither in that White House meeting, nor in the discussions between Nomura, Kurusu, and me over the next three days, did the new Japanese envoys offer any new suggestions.

The intercepted telegrams from Tokyo had undoubtedly proven that a crisis was imminent. Nomura had received instructions to evacuate Japanese residents in the United States, and he had also received a new telegram code, the method being: he could listen to Japanese shortwave news broadcasts and pay attention to the reports on wind direction; from this, he could know whether Japan would break off diplomatic relations with the United States, the Soviet Union, or Britain. The telegram also told him to destroy all codes, secret documents, etc., after hearing this report.

Then, on November 20th—Thanksgiving—Nomura and Kurusu gave me a new set of proposals, which, on the surface, were very extreme. The intercepted Japanese telegrams told us that this was Japan's final proposal. This was a "take it or leave it" ultimatum.

Although the Japanese proposal was so absurd in nature that no responsible U.S. official could dream of accepting it, I felt that my reaction should not be too intense, so as to avoid giving the Japanese side an excuse to break off negotiations.

On November 21st, Kurusu came to see me alone. I asked Kurusu whether he himself or Nomura had any suggestions to offer for a peaceful resolution to the whole problem. He replied that he did not.

After Kurusu's visit to me and his statement that there were no further proposals on this issue, I doubled my warnings to Washington authorities and individuals (including General Stark), pointing out that Japan might take action at any time.

Diplomatically speaking, the situation could be said to be hopeless, but on our part, we were trying everything we could to seek a peaceful solution in order to avoid or delay war. Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Staff Marshall, and Chief of Naval Operations Stark were all people I frequently contacted. They all requested more time to prepare American resistance. On the one hand, Japan demanded a showdown with us. We stood firm for our principles. The Japanese side also did not yield, and tried their best to coerce us into accepting their demands.

On November 21st and 22nd, we prepared to put forward a counter-proposal. We drafted a temporary agreement, to which would be attached an outline of a permanent agreement.

We strived to draft an outline of a peace agreement, including ten main points, to be attached to the temporary agreement. Generally speaking, my colleagues and I had reached the end of our rope in trying to salvage the crisis.

Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau drafted a solution in his department and sent it to me. Although this was another example of the Secretary of the Treasury overstepping his bounds and attempting to take on the work of a second Secretary of State, some of the points were good and were therefore incorporated into our final draft.

The telegram intercepted from Tokyo to Nomura and Kurusu on November 22nd had extended the deadline from November 25th to the 29th. After the deadline, it would be war. The telegram stated: "Adhere to our established policy and do your best. To facilitate the solution we need, you should spare no effort. There are many reasons why we must resolve U.S.-Japan relations before the 25th that are beyond your ability to imagine, but in the next three or four days, if you can complete negotiations with the U.S. side, if the signing can be completed before the 29th (let me write it again—the 29th), if the exchange of notes can be completed, if we obtain the understanding of Britain and the Netherlands, in short, if all things can be completed, then we have decided to wait until that day. This time we mean what we say. The deadline absolutely cannot be changed. After that, things will happen automatically."

"After that, things will happen automatically." Under the shadow of this sentence, we worked desperately for the next two weeks, trying to secure peace, or at least more time.

About an hour after my meeting with the British, Chinese, Australian, and Dutch envoys (then on November 22nd), Nomura and Kurusu came to my residence to see me. Seeing these Japanese representatives arrive at my home with smiles, politeness, and a very friendly appearance was almost a dreamlike environment. Since I knew from the intercepted telegrams of Japan's malicious plan, and understood that Kurusu and Nomura also knew the same information, it was painful for me to talk to them in the same tone and with the same attitude. They sat there, bowing constantly, Nomura sometimes chuckling, and Kurusu also smiling, but in their minds was a thought: if we did not say "yes" to Japan's demands, their government would launch a new invasion within days, sooner or later engaging in war with the United States.

On November 24th, we intercepted Tojo's telegram to Nomura, stating that the previous deadline was November 29th, Tokyo time. Therefore, the sword of the God of War was hanging over our heads, and would erupt after the scheduled time arrived.

### Enthusiastic Support for the Troops, Banquet Celebrating Victory

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the Qingpu County Chamber of Commerce, considering that the national army and local forces had made special contributions in suppressing bandits and effectively maintaining security in the Jiangnan region, held a banquet to celebrate and entertain them. The 20 million yuan in troop support funds raised by various circles in Songjiang has already been distributed yesterday. The Songjiang Security Team received 10 million yuan, the Self-Defense Force received 6 million yuan, and the Police Bureau received 4 million yuan.

The Military Friend Circulating Service and慰問 Team of the Army Friend General 社 of this city is scheduled to rush to Qingpu this morning to participate in the local mass troop慰問 conference at noon today.

### Landing Plan of Bandit Ding Foiled, Corpses Transported to Qingpu and Heads Displayed to the Public, Captured Bandits Detained Awaiting Interrogation, Meritorious Troops to Be Recommended for Awards by Military Authorities

[Reported by this newspaper] The communist bandits of Ding Xishan's unit, who had been rampaging in the Songjiang-Qingpu area, have been completely annihilated after five days of encirclement and suppression since landing in Punan. In the battle of Youbang District, Qingpu, on the 18th, the national army and local teams, under the joint command of Gao, the regimental commander of the 5th Regiment of the Youth Army, and Xing Zuoyuan, the deputy regimental commander, Zhang Shujin, the battalion commander, and Liu Jing, the magistrate of Qingpu County, exerted their maximum power, thwarting the bandits' attempt to establish a command headquarters in Jiangnan to threaten the security of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The rumor that Ding Xishan had been killed has been confirmed. The results of the battle include the capture of seven Thompson submachine guns, one carbine, four light machine guns, three grenade launchers, fourteen rifles, one full-auto/semi-auto rifle, 125 hand grenades, ten bayonets, and ten ammunition clips (with live ammunition). These weapons are extremely sophisticated and are currently stored in the Qingpu County Government. In addition, the captured senior bandit officers include Tang Jingyan (alias Zhang Wang), the "Deputy Commander of the Jiangnan People's Liberation Army Column," Secretary Zhou Yongxing, Propaganda Section Chief Yu Jinzu, Administration Section Chief Wu Jian, Combat Platoon Leader Ji Chunyue, and squad leaders Zhang Ketong, Qian Juemin, medic Zhou Zhimin, signalman Wu Hai, machine gunners Zhou Yongkang, Luo Xiaobing, grenadiers Jin Yinman, Zhang Jinrong, cook Pan Weichao, and soldiers Xu Hexiang, Xie Guoju, Chen Xuezeng, Ma Aniao, Zhang Youcai, Hu Laixing, Luo Ada, Shi Xingfa, Shen Shijun, Sun Azhao, Yu Zide, Pan Xianfa, Chen Caimai, Hu Yincai, Zhang Jin, Lu Mingbao, Wang Kaihua, Yang Abu, Zhang Akang, Lu Dongtian, Yang Zhonghuang, Lin Mingtong, Cai Ping, Li Zhikang, Chang Zicheng, Jiang Fuquan, and Dong Changgen, totaling forty-two people. All of them are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but they were all trained in the Soviet Northern bandit area and sent here. They are currently being held in the Qingpu Police Bureau. A preliminary interrogation will be conducted in the next few days, and the authorities will then decide on how to handle them. The meritorious troops will be recommended for awards by the military authorities.

### Ding's Corpse Dressed in a Long Robe, Died from a Bullet in the Mouth, Insignia Discovered

The thirteen bandit corpses that were killed on the spot in the battle were transported to Qingpu yesterday, including the corpse of bandit leader Ding Xishan. He had a flat head, was wearing a long robe and silk cotton padded clothes, and had a jade seal with the three characters "丁錫山" (Ding Xishan) engraved on it (see photo). It is known that the name used by Ding among the people of Punan was always the character "山" (Shan), but according to the captured bandits, Ding always used the character "三" (San) in the bandit area. Ding's head was hung on the top of the Gengcheng Gate in Qingpu for public display at 11:45 yesterday morning. A young man named Shen from Songze Village in Qingpu, who had been arrested and persecuted by Ding during the enemy-puppet period, rushed to watch after hearing the news, applauded with joy after seeing it, and said that it was definitely the bandit Ding. The head was taken down at 4:10 in the afternoon and sewn back onto the body. Ding died from a bullet in the mouth. According to the national army who witnessed it at the time and the captured bandits, Ding and Tang Jingyan split into two groups due to the encirclement and suppression, each leading a part of the bandits to resist stubbornly in the graves. Later, as the encirclement shrank to within 100 meters, the target became closer and exposed. Xu Dengfang, a first-class soldier sniper from the Fourth Battalion of the Second Regiment of the National Army, swam across a small river and bypassed the back of the base of one of Ding's units, fired a shot, and immediately hit the bandit Ding. Ding and the captured bandit officers were all wearing civilian clothes, which it is said they had changed into by borrowing rough clothes from local farmers, in preparation for escaping after knowing they would be surrounded.

### Purpose of Landing

The purpose of Ding's unit landing in Fengxian in batches this time was not only to harass Songjiang and Qingpu, but to attempt to gather old troops and establish the "Jiangnan People's Liberation Army Headquarters" at the old nest of Guanyintang in Chonggu, Qingpu, and then gradually expand and threaten the security of Nanjing and Shanghai. They planned that if this plan encountered obstacles or they could not survive, they would move to Dianshan Lake or Tai Lake, or go to the eastern Zhejiang area, until they finally realized their plan. However, they did not expect that after landing, they would be followed and pursued by the 152nd Brigade of Fengxian, and then be ambushed by various troops, and captured. According to the captured "Deputy Commander" Tang Jingyan, their equipment was complete when they left Northern Jiangsu, but after landing and being pursued, many people deserted and scattered along the way, so some of the weapons were lost. The remaining bandits were mostly veteran communist cadres, selected and formed by the communist areas in Northern Jiangsu before departure. Their combat effectiveness was quite high, so they were able to maintain the battle for several hours or more in encounters. When Gao, Deputy Commander Xing, and Magistrate Liu of the Youth Army interrogated them yesterday, the captured bandits were still deluded, which shows how deeply they had been poisoned.

### Deputy Regimental Commander of the Youth Army Reports Details of the Encirclement and Suppression

Xing, the deputy regimental commander of the Youth Army who was responsible for commanding the battle, gave a detailed battle report at the Qingpu County Government last night, stating: "On the 17th, the bandit army窜抵 Phoenix Mountain. At noon, Zhang, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion stationed in Chonggu, transferred the 4th and 5th companies and the Qingpu Security Team to ambush them. The 5th Company also transferred to Zhujiejiao to deploy defensive positions for the mountain and lake ports. At the same time, Xing also personally led the 2nd Company from Nanxiang to Qingpu to reinforce. That night, the bandits fled west to Tianma Mountain, and it was reported that they had forcibly requisitioned three civilian boats in Xuxiang, intending to enter the lake. The 5th Company immediately sealed off all ports. At that time, the Songjiang Security Team also arrived. At dawn on the 18th, after confirming the bandits' whereabouts, they launched an encirclement. They made contact near Nanyoubang, with the 5th Company attacking from the west, the 4th Company attacking from the north, and the 2nd Squad of the Qingpu Security Team exerting pressure from the east. At 9:00, the 9th Squad attacked from the southwest. At 10:00, the Songjiang Security Team joined the attack from the north, and the battle situation became intense. The bandits relied on their complete weapons and complex terrain to resist stubbornly for a long time. Near noon, the bandit leader Ding Xishan was shot and killed, and the bandits began to waver. In a panic, they threw hand grenades, but because the ground was wet due to rain, most of them did not explode. The national army, fearing that they would be caught in a stalemate, delaying until dark, and giving the bandits a chance to escape into the lake, and that it would be difficult to start 淸剿, ordered the firing of mortars, and the bandits fell one after another. By 2:30 in the afternoon, the national army had reduced the encirclement to a small area, and shouted and the officially ended.

### Commander Xuan's Remarks

Xuan 　吾, the Commander of the Shanghai Garrison, told reporters yesterday: (1) The communist bandit Ding Xishan's unit's disturbance of several counties in the 　备 district was an attempt to establish a base in Pudong in order to further disrupt the security of this city. Now that it has been completely cleared, its attempt has been thoroughly crushed, and the security of this city has become more consolidated. (2) In this 淸剿 operation, the Garrison Headquarters planned the whole process, with the national army as the main force, and the security teams of various counties cooperated, achieving the expected results. From the time the communist bandits landed until they were 肃淸, they could not stay in their disturbed areas for more than three hours. The national army and various local teams worked closely together, leaving the bandits no room to breathe, weary of running around, and finally 全歼ed. (3) The communist bandits once had the intention of escaping from Dianshan Lake, but the 202nd Division of the Youth Army rode five ships in advance to ambush them, and then pressed the communist bandits into Anzhuang to encircle them, achieving complete success. Personnel who contributed to this battle will be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for rewards. (4) He has ordered the 202nd Division of the Youth Army and the 　 government of Qingpu to thoroughly interrogate the captured bandits. Those who are 　 important will be sent to the police 　 for interrogation, and those who are secondary will be detained in the Qingpu County Government to await punishment. The weapons that were seized 　 　 be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for inspection. It was also learned that Commander Xuan received a telegram from the Ministry of National Defense on the 19th, allocating an additional infantry battalion of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, which will come to Shanghai today to strengthen the 防卫 force of the 备区.

### Ding Bandit's Opportunistic and Changeable Nature; Repeated Reversals

[Our Dispatch] Ding Xishan, who has entrenched himself north and south of the Pujiang River for a decade, is fickle and unpredictable, sometimes an anti-Japanese hero, sometimes a traitorous collaborator, and finally a defector to the communist bandits. He is from Wujiaqiao, Zhuangxing, Fengxian County, the son of a farmer. He has four brothers: the eldest is named Pinshan, the second Jinshan, the fourth Yishan, and Xishan is the third, so he is also known as Xisan. He received no education and was violent by nature from a young age. As an adult, he did not engage in honest work, but idled his time away, specializing in associating with local ruffians. Later, he joined a kidnapping gang and was arrested and imprisoned in 1931 due to a case. In 1937, when the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, the enemy occupied Shanghai. Ding took advantage of the chaos to escape from prison and formed a sworn brotherhood with Li Qimeng and more than ten others who were imprisoned together. They hid in the countryside south of the Pujiang River and operated under the self-proclaimed title of guerrilla commander. By the early spring of 1938, their manpower and weaponry had accumulated to several hundred, and they established relations with our government authorities, being appointed as the Third Detachment of the Loyal and Patriotic Army of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee. In July of the same year, it was reorganized into the Eighth Detachment, and He Xingjian, a special commissioner from the Loyal and Patriotic Army Headquarters, was stationed in Ding's unit for guidance. At that time, the Japanese army also paid considerable attention to him, and from time to time sent troops to encircle and attack him. Later, the instructor He Xingjian was induced to join the enemy, and Ding then in September 1939

defected to the puppet regime. His unit of over a thousand men was reorganized into the "Peace and National Salvation Army 12th Route Army," with He as commander and Ding as deputy. Later, the traitor He was executed by personnel dispatched by the headquarters, and Ding then appointed himself as commander. At that time, he established his headquarters on the Great Western Road in Shanghai, specializing in kidnapping wealthy merchants and extorting huge sums of money to expand his troops. By the late summer of 1940, he was reorganized into the Puppet 13th Division, with himself as the division commander. His influence spread to more than ten counties, including Songjiang, Fengxian, Baoshan, Qingpu, Wujiang, Pinghu, Chuansha, and Nanhui. At its peak, his unit consisted of four brigades, totaling 20,000 men. Because he was excessively arrogant, he was resented by the enemy and did not get along with the traitor Ye. He was imprisoned in eastern Zhejiang. The Japanese army kept a very close watch on him, and Ding was unable to do as he pleased, deeply suffering, and his strength gradually weakened. Therefore, he thought of

turning against them, but before the plan could be carried out, his subordinate Song Lizhi betrayed him and had him detained by Japanese troops and escorted to the puppet capital. Li interceded for him, and he was spared death and imprisoned in Jiangxi. In 1943, Ding made friends with Zhou Shixiong, He Zhong, He Ying and others, a total of twelve people, disguised themselves, forged official documents, tricked their way out of prison, secretly returned to Punan, reorganized his old troops, and staged a comeback. In 1944, he re-established contact with the Loyal and Patriotic Army Headquarters and was summoned back to the rear for reorganization and training. In April of the same year, he returned to Punan to prepare to assist the American landing. In August, the Japanese surrendered, and Ding's unit was initially reorganized into the 11th Column of the Loyal and Patriotic Army's Special Operations Detachment, and later reorganized into the Traffic Police, serving on the Jiaoji Railway in Qingdao, with Ding as the captain of the Traffic Police Brigade. Soon after, he was dismissed from his post due to a case, and immediately began to communicate secretly with the communist bandits. The Ministry of National Defense, believing that he had connections with the bandits, issued an arrest warrant last year, and Ding fled to northern Jiangsu and formally defected to the bandits.

### Seven Casualties Among Officers and Soldiers in the Campaign to Suppress Ding's Bandits

[Our Dispatch] In the recent campaign to suppress Ding's bandits, on the side of the National Army, the youth army squad leader Mei Jibao and one soldier of the Qingpu Security Brigade were killed in action. The platoon leader Dong Hui, squad leader Wen Liewen, and soldier Liu Zunyao were seriously wounded. Squad leader An Pingya and soldier Zhang Wenjiang were slightly wounded.

### Rental Standards; Many Parties Oppose; Calculated According to Index; Land Administration Bureau Drafts Overnight; Submitted to Municipal Council for Discussion

[Our Dispatch] The municipal government convened a meeting of representatives from relevant agencies and organizations yesterday at the municipal government to discuss the issue of rental standards in the city, with over 40 people attending. Director Zhu chaired the meeting. During the meeting, the representatives exchanged opinions vigorously, with many opposing the calculation of rent based on the cost of living index. Speaker Pan appealed on behalf of the citizens that rent must be restricted. He stated: Rental standards must be formulated, but calculating them according to the cost of living index is very unreasonable. Because the income of the majority of workers and shop employees in this city is not based on the cost of living index, they will inevitably be unable to bear the burden. The Rental Ordinance stipulates that the government has the right to designate the maximum amount of rent, and it is hoped that the municipal government will fulfill this.

Yesterday's meeting was for discussion and exchange purposes, so there was no concrete decision, but Director Zhu guaranteed that it would not increase the burden on citizens. The opinions of the representatives can be summarized as follows: (1) It is indeed necessary to regulate rents in this city, but rental standards should not be calculated according to the cost of living index. A more reasonable basis should be researched and determined as the base figure for rent. The so-called reasonable basis is divided into two types: A. Use the average of the current actual rents in this city as the basis. B. Based on the average cost of living index of workers and employees, make an appropriate discount. (2) The adjustment of the rental base number may be considered once every three months. (3) The rental standards for public school employees should be based on the average of the net rent index for employees and workers in the previous three months, and the news and cultural circles will also be given the same preferential treatment. (4) The rental standards for commercial buildings can be slightly higher and should not be rigidly restricted. Director Zhu stated that the Land Administration Bureau will refer to the opinions offered by the above parties and draft the maximum rent amount overnight, submitting it to today's municipal council meeting for approval, and then sending it to the Fifth General Assembly of the Participating Council for final approval.

### Period of Parole for Sick Prisoners Not Included in Sentence

[Our Dispatch] For prisoners who have been convicted and are serving their sentences, if they are released on bail for medical treatment due to illness, whether the period of parole should be included in the sentence has been submitted by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. After research by the Unified Interpretation Law Conference of the Judicial Yuan, according to the provisions of Article 59, Paragraph 3 of the Prison Execution Law, the period of parole due to illness should not be included in the sentence. The municipal court has recently received this instruction. According to this interpretation, the treatment period for the currently paroled traitorous collaborators, such as Wen Lanting and Yuan, will be calculated separately.

### Ding Bandit's Old Influence in Punan Will Also Disappear Invisible; The Three-District Security Commander Talks About the Bandit Elimination Process; Military-Civilian Cooperation Achieves Brilliant Results; It Is Expected That the Communist Bandits Will Not Dare to Disturb the Coast Again Within Three Months

[Our Dispatch] Xie Chengbing, the Commissioner and Security Commander of the Third District of Jiangsu Province, and Zhu Changzhong, the Deputy Commander, returned to Songjiang from Qingpu yesterday morning. When reporters interviewed them, both stated with excitement and delight: "The Shanghai news media's continuous reporting of the true bandit situation, dispelling rumors, and stabilizing public morale have greatly helped this bandit elimination." The reporter also congratulated them on their success and inquired about the post-war arrangements and their thoughts on this Ding bandit invasion. Commissioner Xie stated: The large number of Ding Xishan's old troops in the Punan area and the thickness of their latent influence were well known. Since Ding's defection to the bandits, we have been overly concerned about this. In particular, the counties under the jurisdiction of the Third District are adjacent to Shanghai City. Ensuring the security of the Third District can stabilize Shanghai City. Now that the invading Ding bandit troops have been completely wiped out, it proves the strength of the Third District's garrison and the strictness of the public's self-defense organizations. Furthermore, this incident should serve as a warning to the military and civilians in Jiangnan in the future. As for the losses to the rural areas caused by this pursuit of Ding's bandits and the destruction by artillery fire, investigations will begin immediately, and the government is preparing to provide relief or compensation. Finally, he stated in a very optimistic tone: It is expected that within three months, the communist bandits will definitely not dare to disturb the coast of the Third District again, and Ding's bandit's old influence will also disappear invisibly. Deputy Commander Zhu also elaborated in detail on the military deployment for this bandit elimination. According to him, one hour after the bandits landed on the 12th at dusk, the Security Command received a telephone report from Wanghai Township, Qianjiaqiao Town. Upon receiving this alarm, the Command first telephoned the Songjiang County Government, but when they telephoned the Fengxian County Government for the second time, the telephone line was cut. The telephone lines in various towns and villages in Punan were also out of order, proving that Ding's bandits had made arrangements before landing. However, the telephone lines in various towns were immediately restored the next day, and the National Army and the Security Team began to pursue, exhausting the bandits and giving them no time to attend to other matters. As for the tactics used in this battle, the Command had three principles: (1) The village self-defense team, led by the village head, was responsible for closely following the bandits' tracks and reporting their whereabouts to the Command at any time using the village telephones. (2) The county and town self-defense teams were responsible for blocking. (3) The security teams from all areas concentrated their main forces to encircle and annihilate the bandits. This tactic was very successful. Since the 13th, the Security Command has always been fully aware of the bandits' whereabouts. It was originally planned to annihilate them in the Tianmashan area, but contact was lost between Zhujiahang in Punan and Tianmashan in Pubei. Later, this plan could not be realized. The former was disconnected after eight hours and the latter after four hours. The village heads of the two places have now been detained by the Security Command for interrogation. However, according to their confessions, the village head of Zhujiahang took sick leave, so no one was responsible. The village head of Tianmashan, after the bandits fled into the Tianmashan area, led his troops to follow the wandering bandits, forgetting to report. Both are excusable and will be treated leniently. As for the invading bandits, in addition to Ding and his personal followers, the rest were all veteran cadres of the communist bandits, each of whom was qualified to serve as a company commander. Ding's intention was to come to Punan, gather his old troops, and establish a new base. However, after landing, they were pursued everywhere by the National Army and the Security Team, giving them no chance to rest. Although the 152nd Brigade of the National Army did not catch up in the final battle of annihilation in Anzhuang, they had been closely following the bandits and pursuing them ever since they landed on the coast of Fengxian, to Shenjiajiao, to Yanduntou, across the Pujiang River, across the railway, and finally to Tianmashan. Their contribution cannot be ignored.

The provincial government sent a team to disarm them, and the troops were reorganized to Taizhou. Then I was changed to the artillery battalion commander of the Second Column. After Li Changjiang defected to the puppet regime, I left, and then served as the chief of staff of Huang Xianping's regiment headquarters. Soon after, I left again, planning to establish an independent regiment in Qihai, with 3,000 to 4,000 guns. In the spring of 1941, Tao Yong of the New Fourth Army came and confiscated the guns, and I served as his director (Tenth District of Nantong). Not long after, I went to the Tonghai District to serve as the head of the People's Defense Corps, with about 100 guns. During the rural cleanup campaign, I served as the puppet guard regiment commander. After Li Shiqun's death, the New Fourth Army sent someone to contact me. In 1943, I pulled the troops to the New Fourth Army to serve as the commander of the First Division's Independent Regiment, and later as the deputy commander of the United Resistance (commander Huang Yufeng). After the United Resistance was merged, I served in the work of turning against the puppet army. Not long after, I returned home and worked in a transportation company in Donghe, and then served as the commander of the New Fourth Army's Northern Jiangsu Coastal Defense Command, with a defense zone from Tongzhou to Chongming, with about two regiments of troops.

Joined Ding last August

Q: How did you join forces with Ding Xishan? A: In August last year, Ding Xishan went to Yandong in northern Jiangsu, taking about 20 people to meet Tao Yong, but he did not meet him. He met me, and we discussed expanding in Jiangnan. At the end of the year, he contacted Guan Wenwei, the commander of the Central China Military Region of the Communist Party, and established the Jiangnan People's Liberation Self-Defense Column, with Ding as the commander and me as the deputy commander. This was requested by Ding and agreed to by me.

Q: What task did Guan Wenwei give Ding? A: No task.

Q: What was the plan for coming here? A: The plan was to come here, and Ding Xishan prepared to take in old troops, expand his strength in the areas of Nanhui, Chuansha, Fengxian, and Songjiang, and operate in Taihu Lake, opening up a base in Jiangnan.

We joined forces and retreated west to Wujiaqiao in southern Punan for one night, crossed the railway to Huaqiao Station. Because the township office had a self-defense team and saw many vehicles, we went north to Songjiang Sheshan, Tianmashan, Beisan, and passed through Xuxiang, where we recruited the "Third Sister" who was a local woman, and went to Yunshan Lake and then to Taihu Lake. The next morning, we were attacked by the National Army in Anzhuang.

Q: How many people participated in the battle? A: When we checked the number of people in Xuxiang, there were only 56 people. About this number participated in the battle.

### Knowing That Defenses Were Tight, Ding's Bandits Walked Right Into the Trap

Q: What instructions did Guan Wenwei give you? A: At that time, Guan did not advocate for Ding to come because this place is the triangular area of ​​Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, and the central government would not neglect it. Because Ding insisted, the plan was a military dispute to expand his strength.

### There Is a Black Market for Air Freight in Beiping; The Insider Story of the Reported Malpractice; The District Prosecutor's Office Regularly Summons the Heads of the Two Companies

[Our Dispatch] The case of the Beiping Office of China and Central Airlines being reported for raising freight rates without authorization and being suspected of malpractice is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. It is reported that the reporter is a certain military agency in Beiping, which reported to the Military Affairs Bureau of the National Government. The content of the report is that the planes of China and Central Airlines transported goods to Taiyuan, Shanxi. Because the outskirts of Taiyuan were harassed by communist bandits, land transportation was inconvenient, and merchants tended to use air freight, resulting in the aircraft being in greater demand than supply, so they arbitrarily increased freight rates, entrusting H Ji and Hua Mao freight companies to increase the original 2,000 yuan per kilogram to 21,200 yuan per kilogram. The actual black market freight rate is as high as 50,000 yuan per kilogram. According to the investigation, the 21,200 yuan per kilogram was approved by the head office, but the 50,000 yuan was a private price increase. According to the investigation by a military agency, the so-called H Ji and Hua Mao freight companies are also fictitious names to facilitate collusion between superiors and subordinates. Ding Chuanen, the prosecutor in charge of the case, went to China Airlines a few days ago to question Liu Anping, the acting director of the business department, and Jiang Nengxiang, the head of the freight department, who were important persons involved in the case, and scheduled a hearing on the 24th of this month to investigate. Liu Jingyi, the general manager of China Airlines, Xu Xin, the director of the Beiping Office, Chen Zhuolin, the general manager of Central Airlines, and Wang Bingnan, the director of the Beiping Office, will be summoned to court for questioning.

At the same time, there are still some items that can be shipped to the mainland, which can reduce foreign exchange expenditures, such as paper.

Zhang also mentioned that in the future, Taiwan's rice production will increase, which can help the mainland solve the food problem. Because Taiwan used to export hundreds of thousands of tons, but it needs to replenish fertilizer. He also mentioned that Taiwan's agricultural administration and water conservancy can be used as a reference for the mainland. In particular, rice-producing provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Fujian have sent personnel to study the lessons that can be learned and should be used as much as possible.

Furthermore, Zhang took a train to Beijing last night.

### European Diary (3)

— Li Hanhun

Naval Academy

A brief review of the history of science and machine development provides a deeper understanding of the fundamental reasons for Britain's industrial success. From science to industry, from industry to commerce, from commerce to the exploration of overseas markets, and from the protection of overseas markets to the development of the navy, Britain has earned the reputation of being the "Lord of the Seas." Although there was not enough time to see the full picture of the "Lord of the Seas," thanks to the prior arrangements made by the embassy, I was accompanied by Military Attaché Chen Wuxunying and a liaison officer from the British Admiralty. I was very pleased to visit the Royal Naval Academy, an important institution for naval education.

First, we went to the office, where the president explained the history of the Royal Naval Academy. According to him, "The Naval Academy is located on the site of a royal palace that was built 500 years ago. In 1610, a new palace for the queen was built; in 1640, the English king was exiled and a republican government was established; in 1660, the monarchy was restored; around 1700, during the Anglo-Spanish War, the king and queen, mindful of the hardships of naval officers and soldiers, donated this palace as a naval hospital, which was later converted into a convalescent home for elderly officers and soldiers, and the treasury continued to fund its construction. Later, the elderly officers and soldiers were given pensions instead, so this palace was used as the school site. The office where we are sitting is the former dining room of the English king." He then led us to view the various furnishings in the room and explained the charts on the walls. In the corner of the room was a large clock made in 1680, antique in color and still accurate. In the reception room inside the door were the names of the past presidents, and the right room was filled with portraits of senior naval officers from the Nelson era, which were very impressive. We went out to see the wharf used by the king and queen, and the splendor remained.

St. Paul's circular-style Queen's Palace is the center of the entire school. To the left, right, and front, there are magnificent buildings. To the left is the dining hall and science laboratory. The ceiling of the dining hall is adorned with magnificent murals. On the main seat in the main hall is a painting depicting the entertainment of King George II of England and his three generations, which took 19 years to complete and cost the painter 6,000 pounds. It also depicts the painter reaching out to ask for money, which shows the British sense of humor. To the right is the chapel and staff school (the staff class for officers above the rank of colonel is not permanent), which I did not see in detail. The school's regular class is located elsewhere, and unfortunately I did not have time to visit it. To the left and behind the Queen's Palace stands the Greenwich Observatory, the world's standard time, which I also only saw from a distance, which was a great pity.

After touring the school for a week, we discussed issues such as the ratio of land, sea, and air forces and the importance of the navy after the war. Although the scope was too broad and not all the details were covered, I learned that the highest number of soldiers in Britain during this war reached more than five million. Since the demobilization began on September 18, 1945, it is estimated that by the end of March 1948, the total number of land, sea, and air forces will be 937,000, including 527,000 in the army, 263,000 in the air force, and 147,000 in the navy, which is about three times more than before the war. It also proved that in the future, maritime traffic must be maintained effectively through the cooperation of the sea and air.

It was summer vacation and a weekend, so I was unable to hear lectures in the classroom and various exercises, which I was very unhappy about. After a brief visit, I discovered vitality in the ancient world. Culture and military force are presented side by side. In the past, Britain's dominance at sea had its own reasons.

Oxford University

Huang Bingjun drove, Military Attaché Han Junchang accompanied us, and Jufang prepared notebooks and went straight to Oxford. From the urban area to the countryside, the plains were vast, quiet, and peaceful, which was very pleasant. Soon we arrived at our destination and visited Mr. Xiong Shiyi. Mr. Xiong has written extensively, especially the play "Wang Baochuan," which is famous in Europe and America. The host was hospitable and asked about our health. Then he asked his family to prepare a meal and took on the task of being our tour guide.

Oxford is a famous university district in England. Everywhere you look, you see schools. Oxford was founded more than 1,260 years ago, 20 years earlier than Cambridge. The cultural center with a history of 700 years has been continuous, profound, and ancient. No wonder the British are proud of this. Most of the buildings in the school are old buildings from four or five hundred years ago. The new buildings also strive to imitate the ancient style, so they are full of antique charm. The style is mostly a large courtyard in the middle, surrounded by houses, like a manor in Beiping. Sometimes it is also surrounded by walls with battlements on them, which look like bunkers from a distance. All the crumbling bricks and old tiles, broken boards and dilapidated doors are preserved with great care. Even the accumulated dust on the windows and the cobwebs on the lamps are not willing to be wiped away. Visitors either admire its traditional spirit or criticize it for being too conservative. Although it is a matter of opinion and there is no need to force agreement, it is truly commendable to recall the traces of culture and stimulate the feeling of ancient times.

Oxford has 25 male schools and 5 female schools. Each school has its own independent organization and each has its own president. The so-called Oxford University is actually a general term for these 30 schools with different natures and contents. It unifies the examination and the awarding of degrees. In addition to their own dining halls, dormitories, classrooms, and libraries, each school also has its own chapel, with pointed roofs standing like towering peaks, forming a grand spectacle. Among them, the one that was converted from a church into a school 600 years ago is especially magnificent. Walking into the smallest chapel, I discovered the architecture of a famous artist from the 17th century, which was very exquisite.

There is a horizontal table in the dining hall, which is the professor's seat. Below, the dining tables are arranged in straight rows, with students sitting opposite each other. Students must wear uniforms when eating. Teachers and students do not have to be present every day. Each person has their own dormitory, with a study, bedroom, and cleaning room, all beautifully decorated. Students can live outside the school, but they must live in the school for a certain period of time. After a considerable period of indoctrination. The classroom facilities are simple, with few seats. Some students never enter the classroom all year round. There are classrooms where only two or three people sit.

Oxford University professors do not emphasize form, but emphasize spirit and character cultivation. Each student must choose two tutors, one for academics and one for character, emphasizing both academics and character. Sometimes students gather in the professor's home, and the professor smokes a cigar and does not say a word, and the students sit quietly and think, which is leisurely and fascinating, and the indoctrination is also in it. Deep thought and long-term consideration, quiet and leisurely, have the style of an ancient gentleman and the style of a scholar, which cannot be understood by the petty and shallow people of small countries.

As we walked and talked, we saw several professors coming out of the chapel, wearing red, blue, and black robes to distinguish their subjects. The students wear uniforms of varying lengths. There is order in complexity, and unity and harmony in chaos. The thoughts and preferences of teachers and students can be reflected in their clothing.

We visited the naked white stone memorial statue of the poet Shelley who died in the desert; and the writing desk used by the author of the British Dictionary. We also saw the castle built during the Roman occupation. After thousands of years, only the old fortress remains. Actors are filming an ancient play. We entered the library full of volumes, the degree-granting office surrounded by ancient stone statues, and the graduate school for professors to study. Antique in color and full of treasures.

Finally, we took a car around an elegant street, which is the most beautiful street in England. Leisurely and quiet, it adds to the thoughts of the elegant tune of stringed instruments.

The car returned to Xiong's residence at around 2:00 PM. After lunch, we drove back to the city and visited the botanical garden. The garden is too large, so we only chose to visit the tropical plant section. The glass rooms were full of them. The collection is vast and the facilities are complete. In the bitter cold region, tropical plants are transplanted and can thrive. One cannot help but admire the greatness of science and artificiality. Jufang is especially interested in this because she studies agriculture.

Eton School

If Oxford and Cambridge are representative of the highest institutions of learning in England, then Eton College should be the model of secondary education in England. Due to time constraints, I was unable to visit Cambridge. I heard that Cambridge and Oxford are not much different in scale, but I regret not being able to visit them in person. Eton is very worthwhile to visit. Thanks to Military Attaché Lai Wu Mingtang for coming to pick us up, Military Attaché Han Junchang was also happy to go, so we traveled together.

Eton School is a famous aristocratic school, founded in 1440 by King Henry VI of England. Up to now, more than 500 years have passed, and the scenery and appearance remain the same. As for the classrooms, the wooden pillars, wooden walls, and long tables and benches were all made of wood seized when Spain was defeated in 1600. They are antique in color and shiny. The knife carvings are like chaotic threads, either as titles or as arbitrary drawings, which can be compared to our country's "toilet literature." As for the chapel, the antique colors are mottled and are all treasures. The paintings on the walls are all from 1470 and are especially worth appreciating. Each has a memorial hall to commemorate the 1,157 people from the school who sacrificed for the country during World War I. The school has 27 dormitories and many attached houses, currently accommodating 1,130 students. The deep courtyards and winding alleys have deep connotations. The various buildings in the school are either lacking in light or the walls are painted or peeling off. The courtyard inside the gate is paved with gravel and broken bricks, which is uneven and difficult to walk on. Is this to echo the cobwebs and dust on the lamps at the entrance of Oxford University? The conservatism has reached this point, probably to indoctrinate the students, so that they can recall the past and stimulate their feelings of ancient times?

British students are admitted to schools based on exams, not qualifications. They can take the high school entrance exam at the age of 11 and the university entrance exam at the age of 18 (17 during the war), so they often hire private tutors and do not attend primary and secondary schools and take the exam in time. However, the children of nobles mostly attend Eton School. They must register at birth and enter the school at the age of 7. Eton has a very close connection with Oxford and Cambridge. Those who graduate from Eton and study natural sciences mostly enter Cambridge, and those who study social sciences mostly enter Oxford. Oxford and Cambridge are like the continuation of Eton.

Eton School is not famous for its complete facilities or high level of education, but for its special emphasis on appearance and character cultivation, in order to prepare for future diplomatic negotiations and service to the country. As soon as you leave the vicinity of the school, you will see young gentlemen in high hats and swallow-tailed coats walking on the streets. When you come into contact with them, you will feel that they are polite. Those who go from this school to Oxford and Cambridge will easily become great gentlemen and rise to prominence. In the past, the British giants who galloped on the stage and called for wind and rain mostly came from this school. It is said that 17 prime ministers have come from Eton, and other high-ranking officials are too numerous to count. The school is not entirely aristocratic now, but even the uniforms that are often worn are not something that poor children can afford. However, as times change, today's British dignitaries are no longer exclusively occupied by the aristocracy.

Windsor Castle

After visiting Eton School, we visited Windsor Castle. The palace was built in 1583 and is magnificent in scale, resembling a fortress. There are many old cannons inside, three of which are marked as being obtained from the Chinese war, presumably looted during the Eight-Nation Alliance's invasion of Beijing. A part of the palace is designated as a residence for retired officers (who can live there for life). Although there are strict restrictions and it cannot accommodate many people, it is intended to encourage morale and maintain military morale, and the intention is very far-reaching. Unfortunately, it was a Sunday and most of the departments were not open, so I did not have time to visit them all. The guards in the palace were as still as puppets, and the salutes were especially mechanical. The palace is built on a small hill, overlooking the city and village, and the scenery of the gardens is excellent. Although the palace is beautiful, does the Duke of Windsor, who was abandoned without pity, add luster to this palace?

We took a car to visit Windsor Park. The park is about six or seven miles away from the palace, with distant villages and nearby trees, and the scenery is natural. It used to be a hunting ground for the imperial family, but now it is a place for commoners to visit. It is impossible to find the wild boars and deer of the past, but the lush forests and grasses are still worth recalling. The suburbs are clean, the houses are sparse, and the tranquil scenery is abundant.

At the same time, in order to strengthen supervision such as silkworm seed production at silkworm seed farms, it has been decided to divide the province into six districts: Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiangyin, and Yixing. Each district will have a supervisory station, and supervisory personnel from each experiment station will be assigned to the station to conduct constant supervision.

### Inauguration Ceremony of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Nanchang Yesterday

[Central News Agency Nanchang 19th] The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall here was destroyed in the war. Nationalists in Jiangxi raised funds to complete this palace-style building today and renamed it Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. The entire building covers an area of 98 square meters, with vermilion lacquered door pillars and a pair of stone lions, carved beams and painted pillars, showing grandeur and magnificence.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Rao Xiang Section, Speed up Supplementary Driving Equipment

[Our newspaper Shangrao 15th] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's Rao Xiang section route was originally rushed for construction and the funds and materials were exhausted, only to seek its communication first, and everything was not perfect. Since the connection to Nanchang, the Rao Xiang Section Engineering Office has focused on improving the route and supplementing driving equipment. Various general sub-sections were ordered to do road work with all their strength, and rush repair teams and temporary road teams were established to assist in rush repairs to ensure safety. At the same time, the water supply and driving equipment were sped up and supplemented. However, the funds and materials have not yet been fully allocated. Of the 14 billion yuan approved by the Railway Bureau in January, only 9 billion yuan was allocated. Of the 25 billion yuan approved in February, it has not been allocated. In addition, the incentive-based salary final bonus has long been exhausted; materials and tools are also felt to be insufficient. Recently, only 78 hand-pushed flatcars, 52 lifting machines, and 5 hand-cranked cars have been allocated, which is far from the original approved number. Under these circumstances, although the work spirit of the engineering supervisors on the line is still very good, they all feel that it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. Therefore, the Director of the Rao Xiang Section Engineering Office has urgently requested the Railway Bureau to quickly supplement the 30 billion yuan of construction funds that should be supplemented, and allocate 100 flatcars, 30 lifting machines, and 11 hand-cranked cars, along with other tools, in order to speed up the completion of the full line's opening to traffic. Also, the entire Hangzhou-Nanchang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened to traffic, and all passenger and freight loading and unloading rates and in-station handling rates have been adjusted and implemented from today.

### Anhui Northern Refugees Holding Guns to Rob; Wuxi Self-Defense Force Recovered Six Bandits

[Our Newspaper Wuxi 17th] Recently, bandits in the four townships have been pretending to be self-defense team members. In the name of catching young men, they have肆意searched villages, causing villagers to have sleepless nights. On the evening of the 14th of this month, in Zhang Daguxiang, Zhouxin Town, Naxiang Town, nine bandits, claiming to be dispatched by the town office to conscript eligible young men, all made up their faces, carried two rifles and one pistol, knocked on doors one by one. The young men in each household heard the sound and scrambled to hide. The bandits took the opportunity to enter and loot, returning fully loaded. The next morning, more than 20 residents of the village, their shock subsiding, inquired each other and realized that they had been deceived. However, the valuable clothing and items of each household had all disappeared. On the evening of the 15th, bandits suddenly visited Linxiang, a neighboring village, and attempted to loot using the same methods. At that time, the residents of the village, knowing that it was a Chang brand, were alerted by the braver ones who climbed onto the roof and rang the gong. The bandits, knowing that the matter was exposed, fled into the water one after another. However, the self-defense teams of nearby townships and towns had already received the news and carried weapons to pursue them, but they were not captured. Yesterday morning, He Wenyuan, the mayor of Nanqiao Town, suddenly received a report that more than 20 refugees from northern Anhui were forcibly plundering and causing trouble door to door in the 15th Bao. He immediately ordered the self-defense team to search and arrest them separately, and unexpectedly captured seven bandits, Zhao Yujian, Liu Futong, Zhang Xinping, Lu Wansen, Zhang Yulian, Fang Lianzhong, etc., in the nearby mulberry fields. After being interrogated by the team leader, they all confessed to the robbery without denial, and have now been transferred to the police station for investigation and handling.

### Counterfeit "Xiaozhilong" Medicine Tablets; Principal Offender Released on Bail Without Guarantee and Detained

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 18th] Wang Wenbai and Han Wende, the principal offenders in the case of counterfeiting "Xiaozhilong" medicine tablets produced by Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, were brought to court again by the Local Procuratorate on the 17th for further investigation. The counterfeit medicines were sent to the Drug Bureau for testing. After the interrogation, Wang Wenbai was ordered to post bail with two guarantors, 10 million yuan in cash bail, and 20 million yuan in face-to-face bail. Han Wende was ordered to post bail with one guarantor, 20 million yuan in cash bail, and 30 million yuan in written bail, and was allowed to be released on bail. As a result, he was detained again because he could not provide bail.

### After the Zhengren Incident, Principal Lin Yimin's Determination to Resign Remains Firm

[From our correspondent in Nanchang, 19th] Zhengda University Principal Lin Yimin's determination to resign remains firm. Education Department Director Zhou Bangdao visited and tried to dissuade him on the 18th to no avail. Zhou also telegraphed the Ministry of Education to urge him to stay. Zhengda University's power plant needs light diesel fuel. With the help of various parties, it can now be maintained for three months. The morale of the military in this incident relates to the rectification of the school's atmosphere. Lin does not have ill feelings with the majority of students and faculty. Lin stated that since he took over as president of Zhengda, he has strived to enrich internal facilities and the welfare of staff and students. In the recent half-year, the Ministry of Education has allocated over 2 billion in temporary funds, all of which has been used to repair existing school buildings and add books and equipment, making the faculty lineup much more substantial than in the past. There are now more than 80 professors, 1,263 students in the entire school, and about 40,000 books. Recently, in clearing up past accumulated cases, it was discovered that during Principal Hu Xian's term in the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], a batch of instruments was purchased from the United States, with a value of US$20,000 at the time. These instruments have been stored in Shanghai for several years. It has now been decided to send someone to retrieve them. This is a new initiative since Lin took over at Zhengda, as it had been forgotten because so many years had passed and no one had investigated. Lin concluded by saying that preparations were being made to build a new campus in Lushan. A campus design committee and a campus fundraising committee have now been established. Wang Lingji has agreed to solicit donations from various provinces. Lin also plans to launch a fundraising campaign among domestic and foreign individuals when attending the National Assembly, hoping that people from all walks of life will establish a century-old foundation for Zhengda.

### Drought and Insect Disaster in Zhejiang Province, Relief Funds Allocated

### Wuxi Tax Bureau Audits Business Tax, Shops Close One After Another

[From our correspondent in Wuxi, 18th] The county tax collection office, in order to simplify the collection method for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948] business tax, divided it into eight grades last month and ordered all industries to fill out reports for random inspection to determine the tax amount for each grade. At the beginning of the month, 28 industries, including hotels, silk factories, Chinese medicine shops, cigarette shops, steel, and native tobacco, submitted their lists. After receiving the lists, the tax office immediately sent personnel to conduct random inspections, while at the same time setting a deadline for industries that had not yet reported to do so. At that time, it was approaching the end of the lunar year, and various industries expressed dissatisfaction. Upon seeing this, the tax office suspended the process. Today (the 18th), the tax office sent out a large number of staff again to audit the account books of Chinese medicine shops, silk factories, steel, cigarette, and native tobacco industries. In the afternoon, the audit reached the most bustling area of North Main Street. At Tongfeng Timber Company, the manager happened to be in Shanghai on business, and the staff did not dare to take responsibility, so the account books could not be inspected. The auditors ordered a daily settlement and set a three-day deadline for submitting the account books, but to no avail. They immediately stated that they would come again for inspection at 8:00 a.m. the next morning. It is unknown how, but this caused a misunderstanding. Instantly, all the shops on North Main Street closed early. Before long, shops in the surrounding areas also closed one after another. The auditors who were conducting inspections elsewhere had no choice but to return and report the situation. After learning about this, the reporter set out to investigate and saw that the shops were silent and unanimous in their attitude, with no disturbances.

### Jiangsu High Procuratorate Issues Arrest Warrant for Pseudo-County Magistrate Zang Dongcheng, etc.

### Wujin Launches Suppression Campaign, Furongwei Blockaded

[From our correspondent in Wujin, 18th] A certain youth army unit of the 23rd Suppression Command stationed in the Qishuyan district, together with the local security team and local militia, has blockaded Furongwei on all sides. Boats and pedestrians are not allowed to pass through. A mobile unit has been dispatched to search the village and conduct strict household registration checks. The blockade and search are still in progress. The express boat directly from Wubei to Jiaoxi has suspended operations for several days.

### Focus of Mass Organization and Training: Strict Baojia System

[From our correspondent in Nanchang, 17th, via airmail] The general principles of mass organization and training in the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi were detailed in yesterday's dispatch. Regarding general mass organization and training, a strict baojia system will be implemented. The measures are roughly as follows: (1) Conduct household registration checks; (2) Organize household registers and national identification cards; (3) Implement joint guarantee and joint responsibility agreements; (4) Implement joint guarantee agreements for township and baojia chiefs; (5) Establish covert voluntary surveillance; (6) Establish a police network in all cities and towns; (7) Conduct household registration checks and organization, and implement surveillance. Provinces, cities, and counties

should strengthen and enrich existing people's organizations such as farmers' associations, labor unions, chambers of commerce, education associations, elders' associations, journalists' guilds, women's associations, veterans' associations, drama industry associations, various industry guilds, and various hometown associations. Organizations that have not yet been established should be organized immediately, taking into account the actual situation, and assistance and guidance should be provided separately. Training should be conducted in stages, and meetings should be convened from time to time to expose the crimes of bandits and spies, publicize government laws and regulations, and inquire about the presence of hidden bandits and spies within these organizations, so that they can cooperate with the bandit suppression military operations and participate in the suppression of the rebellion.

Provincial, county, and municipal governments should also convene cadres from various people's organizations to conduct short-term training, lecturing on the meaning and laws of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, preventing spies, and how to lead the general public, assist the army in suppressing bandits and preventing bandits, and consolidate local order, so that they can truly understand reality and serve with dedication.

In provinces, cities, and counties where prostitution has not been banned, brothel industry associations should be organized to unify the management and training of their members, so that brothel personnel have a sense of maintaining social order and paying attention to spies and criminals, and to inspect from time to time whether there are hidden bandits and spies active within.

Senior middle school students and primary school teachers in each province, city, and county should be organized into

youth work teams according to their schools. Junior high school students should be organized into youth work auxiliary teams, and personnel should be dispatched regularly to guide their military training and provide training through seminars, group discussions, and current affairs discussions.

Collect and train out-of-school youths from bandit areas. Provinces should conduct investigations and registrations, designate appropriate locations, conduct district-based training, and assist them in returning to school, transferring to other schools, or finding employment. When necessary, they should also be led to participate in the work of suppressing the rebellion.

Train workers in various industries, such as dock workers, cart drivers, sedan chair carriers, boatmen, teahouse, restaurant, hotel, and bathhouse workers, etc. According to their distribution areas, they should be gathered and trained regularly within the scope of their

labor, so that they have an awareness of maintaining society and cooperating in preventing spies. Opportunity should be taken to organize them separately into various task forces such as stretcher transport and engineering to meet military needs.

Provincial, city, and county civil servants should have their training methods formulated by each province. All civil servants in various agencies, regardless of gender, should be trained, and the heads of each unit should be personally responsible for supervision and guidance.

Regarding the organization and management of refugees, the local party, government, and public opinion organizations should organize

refugee guidance offices. For refugees entering various localities, except for those who already have fixed occupations and are incorporated into the baojia system, the rest should be designated locations, centrally organized, and issued refugee certificates for management, repatriation, and the dispatch of personnel to provide life guidance, job introductions, and handle refugee spy prevention work.

Beggars and vagrants should also be managed separately and given job introductions as appropriate. The old, weak, disabled, and those unable to support themselves should be assisted and accommodated by the social affairs bureaus of each province and city. Civilian vocational training centers should be established so that beggars and unemployed vagrants can learn a livelihood and be able to support themselves independently.

The ultimate goal of mass organization and training in the current stage of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation is to stabilize areas by mobilizing the masses, utilizing manpower, and preventing espionage to assist the army. In areas adjacent to bandit areas, the focus is on how to lead self-defense forces, strictly organize local organizations, prevent sporadic bandit activity, and assist the army in suppression.

### People Allowed to Mine Gold in Hunan's Mining Areas

[From our correspondent in Nanjing, 19th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently received a report from the Hunan Provincial Department of Construction stating that the gold mining areas previously held by the Gold Mining Bureau in Hunan have long been inactive. It was requested that they be opened up to facilitate private operation. The Ministry has now verified that these gold mining areas were approved for preliminary exploitation by the bureau in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Gold Mining during Extraordinary Periods. If the procedures for applying for mining rights were not completed by the end of March of the 35th year of the Republic [i.e., 1946], the original cases can be cancelled separately, and people can be allowed to mine according to law, in order to increase gold production.

During the period of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, the Northwest Highway facilitates troop deployments, troop replenishment, and the completion of rear service facilities, so as to consolidate the national defense strength of the Northwest. The picture shows a certain division passing through Longdong. (Photo sent by our reporter Song Lin)

### Zhou A'lai Transferred to District Procuratorate for Gathering a Crowd to Destroy the Luyangqiao Station

[From our correspondent in Jiading, 17th] Zhou A'lai, a resident of Luyang Township in the county, returned to his hometown on the Xihu train the day before yesterday. When he got off at Luyangqiao Station, he had a dispute with the ticket inspector Guan Jie because he was slow to hand over his ticket. Zhou then abandoned the items he was carrying at the station and left in anger. The station later found out Zhou's address and returned the items intact. Unexpectedly, Zhou suddenly gathered a crowd to cause trouble, destroying the station's desks, benches, and glass, and severely beating and injuring the ticket inspector Guan Jie. The station immediately telegraphed the county government, which dispatched police to suppress the situation and arrested Zhou A'lai, the leader, and transferred him to the district procuratorate for interrogation.

### Mentougou Coal Mine Issue Enters New Stage of Resolution

[From our correspondent in Beiping, 19th] The long-pending Mentougou Coal Mine issue may recently enter a new stage of resolution. The Englishman McBain is scheduled to return to Beiping on the 23rd and 24th, at which time he will bring back the British shareholders' opinions on the recovery of mining rights. The newly established Mentougou Mine Management Committee here will also hold a symposium this week to have in-depth discussions on improving Mentougou coal production.

### Death of Air Force Hero: Gao Youxin, Continued from Page 2

One early spring evening in the Northeast, snowflakes were falling. The elevator of a certain large building in Shenyang was ascending, but the door of the elevator was broken. After the elevator ascended, the door remained open. A junior officer was standing at the door, waiting for the elevator to come down. At this time, an Air Force Major entered from outside the door. The night was hazy, and the lights in the room were not very bright, but the junior officer who was already in the room recognized that this was Squadron Leader Gao Youxin and immediately stood at attention and saluted. Gao Youxin returned the salute. He saw that the door of the elevator was open and thought that his subordinate was letting him enter the elevator first. So, he took a step forward. Immediately, a sound of something heavy falling was heard loudly. Gao Youxin fell down, falling quite deeply. His head was bleeding, and his brain nerves suffered extreme shock. He lost consciousness.

Shenyang lacked medical equipment, so he was sent to Beiping for treatment. Mrs. Gao was by his side, and his condition seemed to improve a bit. At this time, he resigned from his position as Squadron Leader of the Fourth Squadron and was reassigned as a staff officer of the Air Force Headquarters. Later, he went south from Beiping to Mrs. Gao's hometown, the banks of the Xiang River—Changsha, Hunan to continue recuperating. A year passed, and his condition improved even more. For the sake of a quick recovery, in the summer of the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947], Gao Youxin, who was injured, was sent by the Air Force Headquarters to the United States for further treatment. He lived in the home of Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief General Mao Bangchu in the United States, where his life was stable, and he could focus on medical treatment. After examination by famous American doctors, it was felt that his illness did not require surgery and would slowly get better. Mrs. Gao in her hometown of Changsha often received telegrams, which were very comforting. After half a year in the United States, Gao Youxin had almost completely returned to normal and had gained much more weight than before. General Mao Bangchu smiled and said to him, "I think you can take on a new position again."

Everyone was looking forward to a new Gao Youxin. In December of the 36th year of the Republic, he took an American transport ship back to China, traveling for more than forty days. After arriving in Shanghai, he went to his relatives' house at 27 Henry Road. He held several hundred American dollars in his hand and said to his relatives, "Please give these few hundred dollars to Lingling. I'm afraid I won't be able to see her!" After saying that, he looked sad and kept muttering to himself that he had some kind of bad smell. His relatives were very surprised. They offered him accommodation, but he refused, even more so being worried. That night, he was found at the Air Force Xinsheng Society. There he met colleagues who had returned to China with Gao Youxin and learned that the transport ship they were on had encountered a major storm during the journey. Gao Youxin's brain nerves, which had almost recovered, suffered a strong shock again and went wrong.

"This is a kind of phobia. Patients often have feelings of inferiority," said Dr. Su Zonghua, a famous neurologist in Shanghai, when his relatives took him to see him. "I have treated several people with this disease. They need to rest well." Dr. Su estimated that it would take about three to five months. He would need to get injections and take medicine every day and should hire two special nurses to live with him. It would cost about 70 million yuan per month. "This way," he said, "he will get better."

However, Gao Youxin did not immediately do what Dr. Su said. Then, Mrs. Gao rushed from Hunan to Shanghai to meet him. She accompanied him to Nanjing to continue applying for leave to the Air Force Headquarters. The Air Force Headquarters conveniently sent him to the Central Hospital for treatment. Strangely, the doctors at the Central Hospital could not diagnose Gao Youxin's condition. His appetite decreased greatly in the hospital, he lost weight, he only slept, and he didn't want to talk.

Mrs. Gao went back to Shanghai twice. The second time was to come back for the Lunar New Year. She had originally planned to spend the Lunar New Year in Shanghai with Youxin, but Gao Youxin asked a Dr. Ma, "Can I go to Shanghai for the New Year?" Dr. Ma said, "How can you even think about celebrating the New Year in your condition!" As a doctor, he didn't know that some things should be avoided in front of patients, or at least should be said more tactfully. This sentence was so painful to Youxin's wounded heart!

So, Mrs. Gao returned to Shanghai alone to spend the Lunar New Year at her relatives' house. She looked worried. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, she received a phone call from Youxin in Nanjing, and her mood was slightly relieved. On the second day of the Lunar New Year, Youxin, who was alone in Nanjing, went to his uncle Gao Yongen's house to pay a New Year's visit. Only his aunt was at home and made him a cup of tea. Youxin took it in his hand, and the glass cup suddenly shattered. His aunt jokingly said, "This cup of tea was for me to drink anyway."

On February 13 (that is, the fourth day of the Lunar New Year), a friend of Gao Youxin invited him to lunch. After the meal, he sent him back to the hospital. During the New Year, the hospital was cold and deserted. He couldn't stand the loneliness and slipped out alone. He walked to the vicinity of Wulao Bridge. He stopped and took a breath of fresh air. He felt very tired and prepared to return. Not far away, a small train was speeding towards him. He realized that the place where he was standing was too narrow and too close to the tracks. He wanted to jump to the other side of the tracks. He was confident that his long jump skills were very good. But who knew that on an afternoon after a rainy clearing, the soil was loose and he couldn't exert any strength. After he jumped, he fell down, falling right on the tracks. The speeding train pressed on him like Mount Tai. The driver didn't have time to brake, and the wheels had repeatedly run over the body of our air hero. Several hours later, the Central Hospital finally sent a car to pick up the body.

That night, Mrs. Gao in Shanghai received an urgent phone call urging her to go to Nanjing immediately. After she arrived in Beijing, she fainted several times. She was only twenty years old and became a widow! Youxin left her only a daughter who was just one year old.

Chairman Chiang read the newspaper in Lushan and learned of Gao Youxin's death, expressing deep sorrow and sending a wreath. Senior officials from various central ministries and commissions also sent wreaths and eulogies. A memorial service was held in Beijing on the 16th, and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou personally came to pay his respects. The public burial was scheduled for March 29. The bones of a generation of heroes will be buried in the Cemetery of Air Force Martyrs behind Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum!

Gao Youxin's mother now lives in Tianjin. His sister is not yet married and is the director of a nursery at Tianjin National Normal College. One younger brother is studying at university in Tianjin. His mother is over sixty years old this year. We can imagine how sad and angry she was when she heard of the death of her beloved son!

### St. John's University Rectifies School Spirit; Limits Students to Written Answers to Four Questions

[Our Newspaper Report] As the winter vacation is about to end, schools are preparing for the new semester. St. John's University in this city has not yet decided on the opening date due to the issue of rectifying the school spirit. The school was originally scheduled to open on the 17th of this month, but was later planned to be changed to the 23rd due to some reason. However, the school has not officially announced it as of yesterday. The school's board of directors, administrative meeting, and faculty meeting have held multiple meetings to discuss this issue. They all believe that the school cannot be stable at present, and would rather delay the opening date to actively rectify the school spirit. The board of directors stated that if necessary, the school will be temporarily suspended. The suspension time is authorized to the school authorities to be determined based on the school's stability. The school previously issued a "Letter to Students' Parents" asking them to admonish students not to participate in extracurricular activities, and a "Letter to All Students" (see below), limiting them to answering the following four questions in writing by tomorrow, otherwise, it will be regarded as automatic withdrawal: (1) Can the student union represent your personal opinions? (2) Do you need the student union? (3) Should the student union constitution be approved by the school? (4) Are you willing to abide by the oath you took when you entered the school? The original text of the school's letter to all students is as follows: "Our school takes light and truth as its motto, and refines academics to cultivate talents as its purpose. In-class assignments and extracurricular activities complement each other, and there is freedom of speech and assembly within the school's norms. Unfortunately, during the winter vacation on January 29, some students voluntarily participated in the Tongji University incident. Then, at the graduation ceremony held by our school on January 31, the student union staff did not consult with the school in advance, and rashly, at the request of a few students, used coercive means to force the school to allow its representatives to enter the venue and report on the Tongji incident. On the next day, without the school's permission, they convened off-campus students to hold a meeting on campus. This kind of action not only clearly violates the school rules, but also violates the school's purpose of running the school. In addition to the student union bearing full responsibility for this, in order to rectify the school spirit and benefit the students, our school specially asks you to answer the following questions (see above) before the next semester starts. We hope that each student will mail the answers with your name to the principal's office of our school before the 21st of this month. This matter concerns the future of each student's studies, so you must pay close attention. If you discard it and do not reply, you do not need to come to the school to register next semester."

The meeting also stipulated the number of students per class in municipal night schools: (1) Each ordinary elementary, intermediate, and advanced class must recruit 50 students to open a class, and the number of students in class at ordinary times must be more than 30. (2) Each vocational class must recruit 40 students to open a class, and the number of students in class at ordinary times must be more than 25. Classes that do not meet the above standards will not be opened.

### Basketball League Reorganizes Schedule; Hualian and Qingbai Both Triumph; American Soldiers on Both Sides Suffer Defeat

After the unfinished schedule of the Three Basketball League was reorganized, it was held according to the new schedule last night. There were two games in Group A1. The first game started at 6:30 PM. Qingbai played against the American Military Police. Qingbai won 65-42. In the second game, Hualian played against the American Air Force. Hualian won 64-50. Both foreign soldiers were defeated.

Qingbai Defeats American Military Police

In the first game between Qingbai and the American Military Police, after the touch, the American soldiers, Mr. Smith, scored under the basket, scoring the first basket. Qingbai A Cai immediately returned the favor. At that time, the American soldiers seemed to be divinely helped, and Xiao successively scored to lead 8-2. Qingbai counterattacked, Zhuo Guorong made a free throw, and Xianglong Dayun Baokun broke through the basket one after another to exceed 9-8. Afterwards, the two sides fought back and forth, and the scores fluctuated, which was quite tense. After 16 ties, there was a close situation of 21-20. The first half ended, and Qingbai took the lead by one point with 24-22. Changing places to fight again, Qingbai fully attacked, and Xianglong Dayun Junbing all had wonderful structures. The score difference gradually increased. After 31-22, the American soldiers showed a slight rise, but Qingbai's pressure was not relaxed, and they led all the way. When time ran out, Qingbai defeated the American Military Police 65-42.

Hualian Wins Against American Air Force

Hualian played against the American Air Force next. Hualian's main general Li Zhenzhong stayed in Hangzhou and did not return, and could not attend. In the battle between the two armies, the American soldier Ol挥挥挥 waved his hand in, and Heck scored a point with a free throw to lead 3-0. Wu Chengzhang scored under the basket, and Zhang Liangxiong added icing on the cake. Hualian instantly exceeded. Fushan scored a free throw, Adi scored, and Xiangcheng broke through the basket to get a lot of points. At 11-3, the Air Force changed generals, but there was still no turning point. Hualian still led until the end of the first half, with Hualian leading 29-14. After the break, the two formations rounded again. Xue Chong and Song Yuan fell and added four points. The foreign soldiers immediately changed generals, but it was still ineffective. Xue Chong and Fushan successively made free throws, and Song Yuan added icing on the cake, leading remotely with 37-14. Li Meng broke through the basket, and Song Yuan immediately pulled back. After 55-32, Hualian Zhang Liangxiong replaced Bao Songyuan, and the foreign soldiers took the opportunity to rise and gained a little, but soon the overall situation was manipulated by Hualian again. In the last two or three minutes, Hualian was not too much, and Bowler O'Neill scored four goals in a row, and finally lost to Hualian 50-64.

### Liangjiang Women's Sports School Decides to Restore the Middle School Department Next Semester and Expand This Season

Liangjiang Women's Sports School on Weidemai Road in Jiangwan, this city, was founded 25 years ago and has a long history. Thousands of graduates serve in various places and make great contributions. After the victory, the school's buildings and bases were gradually negotiated and recovered. The existing sports facilities, such as swimming pools, skating rinks, gyms, and various sports grounds, are being repaired and constructed in sequence, and it has been decided to restore the middle school department next semester. In order to meet the needs, the school first established a middle school on the original site of the sports school, which has been running for three semesters. Because the environment is quiet and the management is serious, the students are very developed. The original four-story western-style building at No. 4 Ximen Daji Road of the school has also been recovered, and a second campus has been added, with an attached primary school department and kindergarten. This semester, the two campuses will expand enrollment at the same time and set up 100 free places for poor students. All outstanding youths from poor families can apply for free tuition.

### Grand Occasion of the Winter World Games: 28 Countries Participate with Thousands of Male and Female Athletes Competing for Championships in the Snowy Swiss Alps

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Switzerland] In February 1948, the Fifth Winter World Games were held in the village of St. Moritz in the Swiss mountains. Due to the difficulty in purchasing foreign exchange, travelers from various countries were short on funds. Although the number of visiting tourists was not as large as the Second Winter Games in 1928 before the war, the opening ceremony on January 30th at 10:00 AM, led by Swiss President Celio, was attended by as many as 915 male and female athletes from 28 countries across five continents. Raising flags and torches, they paraded in formation, their colors bright and their attire splendid, creating a grand and memorable moment. The competitions, lasting for nine days, were divided into the following eighteen categories:

Competition Programs

(1) Ice Hockey, with the most frequent matches, held daily; (2) Men's and Women's Individual Figure Skating; (3) Mixed Pair Figure Skating; (4) 500-meter (half-kilometer) Speed Skating; (5) 1.5-kilometer Speed Skating; (6) 5-kilometer Speed Skating; (7) 10-kilometer Speed Skating (the above seven items are on ice); (8) Skeleton Speed Racing; (9) Two-Man Bob-Sleigh Races; (10) Four-Man Bob-Sleigh Racing; (11) 18-kilometer Cross-Country Skiing; (12) 50-kilometer Skiing Cross-Country; (13) 40-kilometer Skiing Relay Race (10 kilometers per person); (14) Men's and Women's Individual Downhill Race; (15) Slalom Race; (16) Ski Jumping (the above three items have individual and combined events); (17) Skiing Military Patrol and Shooting; (18) Skiing Cross-Country, Downhill, Shooting, Fencing, and Equestrian Five-Event Competition (the above eleven items are on snow).

Ice Hockey Abandoned

An unfortunate incident occurred at the beginning of the competition: two ice hockey teams from the United States arrived to participate, but they could not reach an agreement. The host country was unable to mediate, so this event had to be abandoned. The Swiss ice hockey players were also unable to showcase their skills, and everyone felt like heroes without a battlefield. Although the Soviet Union did not formally send a team of athletes to this Winter Games, they selected ten sports experts, male and female representatives, and flew from Prague to St. Moritz to observe.

Worthy of Promotion

Our great country, China, has many famous mountains with snow in winter. If we could once hold Winter Games competitions, it would attract tourists from all over the world and create new opportunities for national benefit and people's welfare through intangible exports. The advantages are countless. It would not only promote health and cultivation internally but also promote prosperity and culture externally. The way the local authorities in the Swiss mountain village managed this event, the ski runs and horse trails, the hockey and skating rinks, the 50-kilometer straight-run ski trail, the ski military patrol trail with the highest point at 3,000 meters above sea level, the slopes and jumps for downhill and jumping combined competitions, the special station for the latest sports medicine, and the more than 800 wireless army stations in the high mountains and deep valleys for broadcasting reporters to report on the spot – the layout and planning of these facilities are something that enthusiastic entrepreneurs should take the opportunity to pay attention to and study in advance.

### Provinces Prepare to Participate in the National Games: Anhui Province Sends Basketball Team; Gansu Province Limits Athletes to 30

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Hefei, 19th] Anhui has decided to select a basketball team to participate in this year's National Games. However, due to the financial difficulties of various regions in the province, the provincial games will be postponed.

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Lanzhou, 19th] Due to financial constraints, the number of athletes from Gansu participating in the National Games has been repeatedly reduced and has not yet been decided. Therefore, the centralized training scheduled for March 20th cannot be realized. According to Education Director Song Ke, the total number of athletes, team leaders, and staff will be limited to no more than 30 people. The cost of sending these 30 people will exceed 10 billion. The Education Department is currently re-preparing the budget based on this standard.

### Import Quota List for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons: Officially Announced by the Import Control Commission; Average Number is About 30% Less Than the Fourth Season

[Our Dispatch] The Import Control Commission officially announced yesterday the import quota list for goods in Category (II) of the Fifth and Sixth Seasons (February to July of the 37th year). Shen Zouing, Director of the Quota Allocation Office of the Commission, received reporters at the Bank of China at 3:30 PM and provided supplementary explanations on the import quota list for this period. The main points are: Diesel, wool, rubber, lubricating oil, and lubricating grease, various unregistered vegetable tanning extracts, washed film, and other items in the quota list for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons are about the same as in the Fourth Season. Cotton, grain, coal, Chilean nitrate, sulfuric acid, and other fertilizers are not included and will be determined by the government based on national needs. In addition, the import quotas for other goods are smaller than in the Fourth Season. The lack of foreign exchange funds both inside and outside the government has made it necessary to reduce quotas, which is unavoidable. The average number for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons is superficially about 30% less than in the Fourth Season, but if the excluded goods are included, the actual reduction is only a little over 10%. The combined publication of the import quotas for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons has two purposes: one is to coordinate with the national budget, and the other is to publish it every six months so that manufacturers can make longer-term plans. Whether import quotas should be directly allocated to factories or transferred by importers depends on the nature of the imported goods. For goods with scattered users inland, which cannot be directly allocated to factories, they are allocated to importers, such as film, gasoline, lumber, and hardware. Conversely, goods such as wool and wood pulp can be directly allocated to factories. Regarding the rumors that some importers sell quotas for profit, Shen believes that this is impossible because the Commission is very strict in registering importers. Registered importers must have regular business dealings abroad, and the current quotas are based on certain criteria. The issuance of licenses must be based on purchase contracts, so there is little possibility of fraud. The detailed figures for the quota allocation of various imported goods are attached below: (Unit: Thousands of US Dollars)

Goods Amount

1. Gasoline, petroleum ether, and light gasoline 5,000

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise; Social Affairs Bureau Changes Sales Method; Standard Calculated Based on Daily Sales Reports

[Our Dispatch] The Rice Market Management Committee received instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to change the method of selling rice. The details are as follows: (1) From now on, the amount of rice allocated to each rice shop for sale should be based on the quantity listed in the daily sales reports submitted in December of the 36th year. (2) The amount of rice allocated to each rice shop for sale should be based on the average daily sales quantity reported in December of the 36th year. (3) Rice shops that have not obtained a grain dealer business license or have not submitted daily or monthly reports in the past will not be allocated rice.

Another dispatch: The rice market continues to rise. Yesterday morning, due to the high price of rice from Wuxi, the market price limit was raised to 1.95 million yuan. People remained anxious, and owners raised prices again. The early rice market opened at 2.09 million yuan. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau began to sell rice and changed the method to allocate rice according to the average daily sales quantity of each rice shop in December. The standard for wholesalers was the sales quantity reported in December, and the price remained at 1.75 million yuan. In this way, the allocated amount was sufficient for needs, and people's minds were relieved. There were many who sold, and the market declined. Early rice retreated to 2.05 million yuan, white glutinous rice was traded at 2.12 million yuan, and thin rice and Xiang rice were each at 2.1 million yuan. White Yuan reached as high as 2.25 million yuan, still 350,000 yuan higher than the previous days. At the close of the market, due to the strong rise in miscellaneous grains, the market situation became even tighter, and owners stopped selling again. According to inquiries in the afternoon, more than 12,000 piculs of rice were allocated yesterday.

Flour, Oil, and Miscellaneous Grains Continue to Rise

Flour and bran are rising sharply, because the price in Wuxi has risen, which has affected this place. Owners rarely sell, and retailers are eager to buy, not hesitating to pay high prices, so owners are shouting prices to the sky. Old car flour opened at 960,000 yuan and once reached the 1 million yuan mark, eventually trading at 980,000 yuan. Naval vessel flour was 970,000 yuan, a huge jump of 100,000 yuan each from the previous day. Although there were not many transactions, the market was very strong. Bran also rose sharply by about 100,000 yuan. A large bag of bran was 620,000 yuan in the morning and even higher at 630,000 yuan in the afternoon. Wheat factory price was 1.3 million yuan. The edible oil market, due to the sharp rise in Wuxi, affected the Shanghai market. Owners were shouting prices to the sky, and there was an unprecedented surge. Everyone unanimously expected high prices, and retailers competed to buy. Soybean oil rose the most sharply. Dachang New Datong opened at 4.8 million yuan, each up 450,000 yuan. Jiton raw oil reappeared at the 5 million yuan mark, at 5.25 million yuan, an increase of 350,000 yuan. Raw vegetable and sesame oil each rose by about 400,000 yuan, and small car sesame oil broke through the 6 million yuan mark. Soybean cakes rose sharply by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Miscellaneous Grains: All rose, especially sesame. Soybeans rebounded and rose. Under the absorption of Guangbang, the price of raw kernels in Zhongguan jumped 100,000 yuan, and the price of high-grade goods rose sharply by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Hankou white sesame reached as high as 3.07 million yuan, a huge jump of more than 400,000 yuan compared to yesterday's market. All grains rose, but corn fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.

### Sugar Sales Strong and Prices Rise; Taiwan Sugar's Allocation Price Increases

Taiwan sugar was allocated as usual yesterday, but the price increased by 75,000 yuan due to the increase in the value of Taiwan currency to 104-109. The education fund increased by 10,000 yuan, and rock sugar increased by 100,000 yuan. The current quota is based on 70% of the quota in the fourth and fifth periods of last year, about 25,000 bags, all 180#2 grade granulated white sugar. Rock sugar from Taiwan was all canceled due to the large number of applicants. The association's allocation and transactions to the north were very smooth and continued to rise, with the highest increase reaching 10%. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar rose from 2.85 million yuan to 950,000 yuan in the morning, 40% white sugar was 2.9 million yuan, grass bag oily goods were 2.45 million yuan, and 20 medium granulated white sugar was 2.36 million yuan to 400,000 yuan.

### Domestic Tea Remains Firm

Recently, the foreign tea market has been in a state of quietness. The reason is that the production cost of Chinese tea continues to increase, while the price of tea abroad is gradually decreasing. Under this situation, exports cannot recover.

Due to the continuous outflow of domestic fancy teas from this street and Hakka merchants, the buying interest remains strong. However, buyers are hoarding goods due to scarcity, and the asking price is becoming more and more aggressive. At the close of the market, negotiations between the two sides had not yet been successful, and transactions were difficult to carry out. However, the momentum remained the same, and the market rebounded again.

### Huge Difference in Transactions by Banks and Bureaus, Totaling 518.7 Billion

[Our Dispatch] The national banks and bureaus had a difference of 518.7 billion yuan in transactions yesterday.

The main items in the difference were the proceeds from the sale of cotton yarn, the settlement of foreign exchange, and the rice funds.

### Management Measures for Remittances and Cash Transportation: Gold Management Bureau to Implement Starting Tomorrow

In order to cooperate with the control of finance, tighten credit, and strengthen the implementation of preventing excessive concentration of inland funds in cities, the Ministry of Finance has formulated four management measures for remittances and cash transportation from various places to Shanghai and Guangzhou, in order to avoid hindering the circulation of funds for legitimate industrial and commercial activities. It is learned that the above measures have been ordered by the local Financial Management Bureau to be implemented from the 21st, and a public notice was issued on the 20th, ordering all banks and companies to comply. The contents of the measures are excerpted as follows:

(1) For remittances from local national bank branches, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks to Shanghai and Guangzhou, and remittances from national bank branches, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks in Shanghai and Guangzhou, if the total amount exceeds 200 million, the details should be listed daily and sent to the local Financial Management Bureau or the local Central Bank for verification. The Financial Management Bureau or the Central Bank may notify the remitting bank to stop accepting remittances from a certain remitter or to stop paying to a certain payee if deemed necessary.

(2) The amount of funds that local national bank branches, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks request from the Central Bank for interbank transfers each month should be directly negotiated with the local Central Bank.

(3) For those who transport cash from the inland to Shanghai and Guangzhou, each person shall not exceed 100 million yuan. The inspectors will return the excess part to the local Central Bank for deposit in a special account, issuing a three-month fixed deposit certificate, which will be returned upon maturity. This provision applies equally to silver and money companies.

(4) For those who cannot remit or transfer funds through banks for legitimate purposes and must carry cash to Shanghai and Guangzhou, they may apply to the local Financial Management Bureau for a cash transportation certificate, which can be carried with the certificate and is not subject to the above restrictions. However, this application can be handled at the local Central Bank in places where there is no Financial Management Bureau. The cash transportation certificates issued by the Financial Management Bureau or the local Central Bank should be reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification on a monthly basis.

### Cotton Purchase Contract: Signed Yesterday at the Yarn Control Commission; Purchases to Begin on March 1st

[Our Dispatch] The cotton purchase contract entrusted by the Yarn Control Commission to the cotton merchants' association was officially signed at the conference room of the Commission at 3:30 PM yesterday (19th), presided over by Chairman Yuan himself. Representatives from the cotton merchants included Liu Bingsun, Chairman of the Shanghai Cotton Industry Association, Feng Renjie, Zhang Weishi, Cheng Youfu, Chen Linsheng, Sun Bingzhi, members of the Standing Committee, Liu Xianzhou, Zhang Bingzhi, member representatives, Ge Jechen, representative of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and Chen Shengcong, Director of the Commission, Pan Jianliang, Secretary Yuan Shenglu, etc., handled the contract signing procedures. Chairman Yuan gave instructions on the spot, stating that this is the first pilot project and hoped that they would work hard to complete the task, be careful to prevent the participation of those with weak financial resources and bad intentions. The funds for purchasing cotton must not be used for other purposes, and the association should be responsible for auditing, and it is hoped that the flower collection procedures will be completed in the shortest possible time. The cotton merchant representative, Chairman Liu, replied that they would strictly abide by the contract and handle it properly, and those without real protection would not be allowed to participate, and cotton purchases could begin from March 1st.

Another dispatch: According to Article 2 of the National Yarn and Cloth Management Measures and Articles 9 and 10 of the Implementation Rules for Unified Purchase of Cotton, any yarn mills in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces with less than 3,000 spindles, and other yarn mills in other places that have not been designated by the Commission to spin, may apply for a purchase certificate after registration and approval, designate an area, and purchase on their own according to the price designated by the Commission. All the above yarn mills should immediately collect the registration form from the Commission and truthfully declare and register within the time limit for verification and handling. It is learned that the application deadline is the end of February for yarn mills in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and the end of March 10th for yarn mills in other places.

Cotton Yarn Rises and Falls Sharply

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was turbulent, with huge fluctuations in the middle. The initial opening price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was 79 million yuan, which immediately jumped by 800,000 yuan. Later, due to the extremely strong absorption from all sides, the asking price rose again, breaking through the 80 million yuan mark, shouting an unprecedented new record of 82.5 million yuan.

The 21-count current Double Horse yarn, after opening at 50 million yuan, rose sharply due to the strong pull from Hakka merchants, and the market rose to 54 million yuan. Near the close of noon, the authorities in charge of spinning and construction, in view of the endless rising wind, once again listed prices and accepted applications from the industry. Because people in the industry felt slightly strained due to repeated suspensions, market sentiment turned to release, and table gangs and short sellers also took advantage of the situation to sell off, and the asking price turned sharply down.

By the end, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 200,000 yuan from the previous day, to 78 million yuan. The 21-count current variable horse was 52.5 million yuan, an increase of 1.5 million yuan. The 32-count, 10-count, and 16-count grades continued to rise by 700,000 to 2 million yuan. The 40-count grades saw both honor and disgrace.

Another dispatch: The Yarn Control Commission continued to entrust the Spinning and Construction Company to open 18 kinds of yarn at the Yarn Industry Association yesterday. 103 households applied for purchase, and a total of 898 pieces were applied for. As a result, 24 households were approved to purchase, and a total of 645 pieces were approved, totaling 740 pieces of 20-count yarn. The price of 20-count yarn ranged from 46.5 million yuan to 48 million yuan.

Another dispatch: The China Spinning and Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, opening a total of 34 kinds. Due to the maximum supply, a total of 125,990 bolts of cloth and 450 sheets were sold. 2841 purchase orders were received, an unprecedented quantity. Excluding the 66 orders from manufacturers purchasing 14,720 bolts of cloth, the rest were all purchased by cloth shops.

Spot Cotton Market Continues to be Firm

Yesterday's spot cotton market maintained its upward trend and remained firm. The industry's money was very loose, and the absorption did not decrease. Yarn mills in other ports also made purchases, and the market price rose by more than 100,000 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the sharp rise and fall in cotton yarn, people's minds were slightly tired, and the market stabilized. However, the industry's buying intention remained strong, and transactions were still active, with 760 bales traded.

The factory price opened at 8.143 million for Han fine, 7.357 million for Han coarse, and 8.846 million for improved American, with 150 bales traded. The warehouse price opened at 9.05 million for Shashi, 7.936 million and 8.102 million for Han fine, 7.027 million for Han coarse, 9.507 million for Lingbao, and 8.269 million for Bailuo to, with 610 bales traded, and 1.889 million for Zhoupu cottonseed.

### Bearish Forces Intensify, Shanghai Stocks Fall From Highs

Shanghai stocks initially rose yesterday following the increase in commodity prices, but lacking buying support, investors began to liquidate their positions. Bearish forces seized the opportunity to intensify their short selling. National banks' price differentials widened further, causing stocks to fall from their highs. Swap premiums were very cheap, further dampening buying sentiment. The morning opened relatively stable, with Yong Yarn starting at 850 and 877 yuan for immediate delivery. No. 97 and others were traded immediately upon offer. Deferred delivery transactions were limited, retreating to 841 and 872 yuan. No. 103 and others were traded immediately upon bid, while No. 155 and others were traded upon deferred bid, rising to 859 and 889 yuan. No. 105 and others were sold immediately upon reaching highs, while No. 125 and others offered deferred delivery. Over-the-counter interest rates remained at 2.25 and 2.7 jiao. Yong Yarn retreated to 849 and 876 yuan. With easing credit conditions, external stimulus re-emerged, with No. 23 and others being traded immediately upon bid, and No. 183 and others absorbing deferred delivery. Yong Yarn then surged to high prices of 876 and 901 yuan. No. 117 and others forcefully sold spot and deferred delivery, while No. 15 and others offered immediate delivery incessantly. No. 61 also sold deferred delivery. Yarn and cloth prices indicated a decline. Smaller stocks were mediocre and lacked momentum. Yong Yarn fell back to 857 and 880 yuan, before closing at 862 and 885 yuan. Compared to the previous closing prices for immediate delivery stocks, Zhabei China Silk remained flat. Yong Yarn, Sino-British, China Flour, Match, Yong Gong Underwear saw slight gains. Unified rose by half a percent, Rong Feng fell by half a percent, and the rest experienced slight declines. Deferred delivery stocks rose more due to premium prices, with China Flour rising by 1.5%, and the rest improving by 0.5%.

In the afternoon, Hong Kong Electric saw contraction. Yong Yarn slightly rose to 870 and 88 yuan upon opening. No. 89 and others continuously offered spot delivery, while No. 196 and others offered deferred delivery. National banks' price differentials reached more than 500 billion, deteriorating further. Near closing, Yong Yarn unexpectedly fell to low prices of 832 and 854 yuan, with spot delivery closing at 832 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning closing prices for immediate delivery stocks, Zhabei, American Asiatic, Sino-British, and China Silk fell by 0.5%. China Flour remained flat, Datong rose by 0.5%, and the rest experienced slight declines. Deferred delivery stocks saw China Flour fall by 1%, and the rest experienced slight declines. Over-the-counter unlisted stocks saw a slight increase. Spot and deferred arbitrage trading saw premiums decrease yesterday due to an excess of positions and limited long positions. Bearish premium bids only amounted to 1.2 to 1.5 jiao per day. Smaller stocks were more expensive, with most being pre-ordered. Domestically, Yong Yarn's premium retreated from 33 yuan to 25 yuan, before closing at 26 yuan. Sino-British decreased from 15 yuan to 12 yuan at closing. American Asiatic decreased from 50 yuan to 45 yuan, and Xin Guang retreated from 4.7 yuan to 4.2 yuan. The Central Bank raised the interbank deposit interest rate to 1.5 jiao, leading many arbitrage positions to be transferred to the Central Bank.

### Government Bonds Plunge, Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Government bonds initially rose yesterday before declining. Unified C started at 90,000 yuan, then gradually fell to close at 82,000 yuan. Approximately 3 million yuan in transactions occurred. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices, A and B bonds fell by 4,000 yuan, Unified C fell by 7,000 yuan, D bonds fell by 6,000 yuan, and E bonds also fell by a little over 5,000 yuan. Yesterday, rubber stocks suddenly increased significantly due to low prices and the restoration of production. Wealthy households had considerable buying appetite, suddenly increasing prices significantly. Blue Grid was the highest, with transactions reaching 250,000 yuan, then slightly declined along with other popular stocks. Jardine Yarn opened at 760,000 yuan, gradually decreasing from 780,000 yuan to close around 720,000 yuan. Foreign merchants were buying, while demand for warrants varied. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices, Xiang remains flat, rubber stocks improved by about 0.5%, Jardine Yarn, Aviation, declined, while British Association, Jardine, Tram, rose.

### Soviet Newspaper Imported in Large Quantities

The Soviet ship "Suluness Nai," managed by Maotai Company, docked at Pier 2 of Swire Dock on Zhongshan East 2nd Road this Monday, transporting 850 tons of Soviet rolled newspapers and 180 tons of steel plates from Vladivostok. Due to the lack of import permits, the steel plates are now being transferred to Swire Hubei ship for transportation to Hong Kong.

### Treasury Bills Selling Well

[Report from this newspaper] Since the Spring Festival, the sale of short-term treasury bills for the 36th year has been quite brisk. As of the 18th of this month, the second tranche of treasury bills has sold a total of 3,136,120 US dollars nationwide, equivalent to 198,818,834,000 Legal Tender. Among them, Shanghai accounted for 2,074,690 US dollars, equivalent to 133,813,915,000 Legal Tender. Furthermore, the Treasury Department has allocated the second tranche of treasury bill certificates to the National Bank for distribution to various sales agencies. Anyone purchasing these treasury bills can go to the various agencies to exchange them with their reservation certificates.

### Cigarettes Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the cigarette market saw a continuation of relaxed credit conditions. Demand from the industry remained strong, and with no confirmed news about Yizhong and Huacheng distributing their goods, inventory was tight, and demand exceeded supply. In the end, the price of the top ten "Great Britain Old Knife" cigarettes continued to rise by 3.4 million to 8 million compared to the previous day. Huacheng Company's "Beautiful" and "Golden Mouse" cigarettes jumped by about 20,000 yuan per carton. In addition, various Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose by 5,000 to over 10,000 yuan.

### Coal Prices Rise

Yesterday, the coal market saw a strong performance from street vendors due to disruptions in the supply of goods. Combined with the rise in the prices of various commodities, industry players mutually absorbed the supply, leading to an increase in the price of Jiaozuo lump coal by 500,000 yuan per ton, reaching 11.5 million yuan. Small White Coal reached 7.8 million yuan, rising by 300,000 yuan. Bituminous coal and coal dust also rose by 45,000 yuan. White charcoal was priced at 460,000 yuan per dan, green charcoal at 520,000 yuan, and black charcoal at 410,000 yuan, also improving by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, firewood and coal briquettes remained stable.

### Fine Cloth Slightly Recovers

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened steadily. Subsequently, due to strong demand from Hankou and Nanjing merchants, industry players and individual investors frequently engaged in speculative bidding. Powerful players and dyeing factories showed strong appetite, causing the prices of various cloths to rise again. Later, around 10:30 AM, it was reported that Textile Building Company, in order to meet market demand, supplied a large quantity of goods, with six grades of fine cloth and serge being listed. Sentiment turned weak, and the market slightly recovered.

In the afternoon, due to reports that credit conditions would tighten, long positions suddenly became more inclined to sell, momentum unfolded, and market sentiment slumped. As a result, various grades of fine cloth such as 12-pound Dragon Head declined by 40,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Si Junzi Straight Tribute and Serge also saw a decline of 20,000 to 50,000 yuan. However, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth and Shilin cloth, due to the start of spring sales, saw prices rise by 50,000 to 120,000 yuan.

### Rayon Rises and Falls Sharply, Silk Goods Market Firm

The rayon market experienced a sharp rise in the morning and a rapid decline in the afternoon. No. 120 Asahi and Kin Sanma gloss opened around 10 million yuan in the morning. Then, due to a large number of purchases by outsiders, prices soared, reaching a maximum of 30 million yuan. The midday closing was slightly softer at 27 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was a lack of supply and an excess of demand, leading to an unsustainable and rapid decline. The final price dropped to 16 million yuan, still up by 10 million yuan compared to the previous day. Yesterday morning, the plant-spun silk market was also affected by the soaring rayon market, and prices also soared. There were five packages of transactions of Five-dan Head C-grade by outsiders, priced at 13 million yuan. Actual sales only involved a small amount of business, with high-grade small lots priced at 10 million yuan. The afternoon saw a softening. C-grade was priced at 10 million yuan, but there were few buyers. Qian Jing still lacked open business yesterday, and asking prices were also slightly raised. Yesterday, the silk goods market was volatile. Huaqiang real silk quilt covers opened flat, with transactions at 6.8 million yuan. Subsequently, due to enthusiastic absorption by street vendors and outsiders, prices rose steadily, soaring to 7.9 million yuan in a moment, fluctuating between 7.8 million yuan. Afterwards, it became firm again. The highest spot transaction was at 8.6 million yuan, and the closing price slightly declined, with spot transactions at 8 million yuan. Da Cheng checkered crepe had transactions at 203,000 yuan. Other goods mostly rose, but not as dramatically as quilt covers.

### Talking About Special Home Nursing

— Cang Long

Due to lifestyle habits and various other reasons, Chinese people generally prefer to stay at home when they are sick rather than staying in the hospital. There are many pros and cons to this, which cannot be fully described at once. For example, home is always more comfortable than the hospital, and the care of loved ones is always better than the care of nurses. However, the facilities at home are not suitable for medical treatment, and the care of loved ones cannot cope with changes in symptoms. In that case, staying in the hospital is better. Therefore, in order to adapt to this contradictory need of patients, the so-called special home nursing came into being. Indeed, for the sake of the patient, it is extremely worthwhile. They can comfortably stay at home and enjoy the care of their loved ones, while also compensating for various medical and health shortcomings. That is truly ideal.

However, the reality often contradicts the ideal, especially in the case of this type of special home nursing. Although many of them are formally graduated from nursing schools or have been trained in large hospitals for many years, the quality of most special nurses is very low. Not to mention that they completely lack all basic medical knowledge, they do not even understand the patient's psychology. And the most intolerable thing is that they have no sense of responsibility for the patient's health. Regardless of the changes in the patient's condition, they are always indifferent and do not know to remind the patient or the patient's relatives, let alone report to the doctor. Sometimes, they even criticize the doctor's treatment in an arrogant manner or recommend some secret remedies to the patient.

We must not underestimate that the actions of these special nurses are harmless to both the patient and the doctor! In reality, they can invisibly ruin patients who have good prospects of recovery. Therefore, I loudly call for the reconstruction of special home nursing, and I hope that the health authorities will ban it or improve it!

### Methods to Promote Breast Milk

— Wu Manqing

According to a report by Dr. M. Robinsan of St. Thomas Hospital in London, he conducted a practical study of various secretion conditions during the breastfeeding period of postpartum women in 500 cases. He believed that giving a large amount of thyreoicea sicca can certainly promote increased milk secretion, but using Lugol's solution (i.e., giving the postpartum woman six drops of Lrgol's Lolution twice a day, with oral administration in milk) can further strengthen milk secretion. As for the use of other endocrine hormones to increase milk secretion, the effect is very minimal. Of course, we can use endocrine hormones (such as Oetragen) to increase milk, but it can only be used within four days after childbirth. And if the dosage is not handled carefully, not only will the milk not increase, but the milk will decrease. Robinson also said that if milk can reach 285 cc on the fifth day after delivery, and 455 cc on the tenth day, there is no need to worry about reduced milk secretion in the next six months. Ordinary treatment for insufficient milk secretion should start on the sixth day after delivery. If the milk volume is less than 285 cc, it should be treated immediately without further delay. As for the calculation method of the milk volume, it is very simple. Just use a scale to calculate the baby's weight before and after breastfeeding, and the exact number can be measured. In addition, in order to know the actual situation of the milk volume, another test should be carried out after the fourth week of breastfeeding, so as to find a way to maintain its original level. Robinson selected 27 out of 99 cases suffering from insufficient milk syndrome for treatment with Lugol's solution (this solution contains 5% iodine and 10% potassium iodide). The remaining patients were either massaged to promote milk secretion, or injected with isotonic physiological saline (one cc injected into the muscles every other day, for a total of five injections), or no treatment was given at all, in order to compare the above methods. As for those taking the above-mentioned Lugol's solution, they were instructed to take it every day until the daily milk volume reached 455 cc (which usually takes about seven days). Among them, seven people voluntarily gave up breastfeeding because their nipples were very painful when breastfeeding, so it was impossible to test the effectiveness of Lugol's solution. Also, in these seven people, some people's milk volume was not accurately calculated and was not recognized as a test object. In addition, one of them had a very painful lump in the breast, which became more painful 24 hours after taking Lugol's solution. From this it can be inferred that such patients should certainly not take Lugol's solution. However, if this lump can be dispersed by taking smg Oesrrogen orally every four hours, then Lugol's solution can also be given later to promote milk secretion without causing lumps to recur.

After implementing the above-mentioned tests, those who took Lugol's solution orally had 456 cc of milk on the twelfth day (approximately equal to the secretion volume of a normal healthy parturient). Those using breast massage had only 314 cc, those using isotonic physiological saline injections had 156 cc, and those who did not receive any treatment had 171 cc. Also, after the fourth week of the above methods, those using Lugol's solution had 598 cc (the secretion volume of a healthy parturient should be 710 cc at this time), those using massage had 313 cc, those using isotonic saline had 342 cc, and those who did not add any treatment still had 171 cc, but they had no intention of breastfeeding their children. What is most noteworthy is that all those who have taken Lugol's solution containing iodine have never had any iodine side effects. And the children they nourished all grew up and were healthy. However, one of the postpartum women only had a few drops of milk within seven days after delivery, and the breast was swollen and became lumpy from the second day after delivery. Therefore, Oetroen was given orally from the third day after delivery, and it softened as usual from the seventh day. Then, iodine was continued, and by the thirteenth day, there was already 200 cc of milk.

In addition, there were a total of nine cases suffering from too little milk secretion, all of whom were given an iodine solution at the end of the puerperium. (Take 0.6cc orally three times a day with oral administration in milk). About three weeks later, the children of three people could survive entirely on their mother's milk. Also, among the nine people, only one case seemed to be ineffective.

According to the above experiments, the reason why milk secretion is insufficient seems to be greatly related to the lack of continuine and the obstruction of ovarian secretion. Ovarian preparations can be used to treat it in the first four days after delivery. The so-called breast swelling, becoming lumpy, and having thick, yellowish milk is due to the obstruction of ovarian secretion. If the breast is soft and empty, it is due to lack of iodine. Therefore, giving iodine when ovarian secretion is obstructed is certainly ineffective, and iodine can only be effective after ovarian secretion is normal. According to the author's report, this method of promoting increased milk secretion not only does not harm the baby, but also has nothing to do with the parturient (see the British Medical Journal 451600 Brit. M. J. 1947, 4516 in 1947).

### Defense Against Tuberculosis

— Yu Zhengxing

Now I will introduce several early symptoms as follows:

1.  Colds that last for more than five weeks without improvement, persistent coughs that don't stop.

2.  Afternoon fever, flushed cheeks, night sweats, occasional cough (short and small sound) without phlegm.

3.  Weight loss, physical weakness.

4.  Hoarse voice, difficulty breathing, back pain.

5.  Sudden hemoptysis, or a history of hemoptysis.

6.  Indigestion, loss of appetite, reduced food intake.

7.  Feeling tired after only slight exertion.

8.  Coughing up phlegm gradually upon waking up in the morning, feeling tired for no reason.

Anyone who discovers any of the above situations should immediately consult a specialist doctor for examination. It is best to use X-ray fluoroscopy of the chest. If, after examination, it is not tuberculosis, then you are lucky; if unfortunately you have lung disease, then you should have great determination to seek medical treatment, absolutely follow the doctor's instructions, and only then is there hope of recovery.

(6) Defense Against Tuberculosis

China is the country with the highest prevalence of tuberculosis in the world. The prevalence is rampant and the impact is huge. It is truly a decisive factor for national strength and survival. Fifty years ago, it was mostly the same in European and American countries. Since then, tuberculosis transmission has gradually decreased, and progress has been particularly rapid in recent years. Taking the United States as an example, the tuberculosis mortality rate was nearly 400 people ninety years ago. In 1900, the death rate was 202 per 100,000 people, and the mortality rate gradually decreased thereafter. Calculated every ten years, the first decade decreased by 20 percent; the second decade decreased by 23 percent; the third decade decreased by 33 percent; the fourth decade decreased by 34 percent. Until 1940, its mortality rate was only 45 per 100,000. They are also planning to prepare to eradicate tuberculosis and continue to reduce the tuberculosis mortality rate. It is estimated that in 1950 it will be 32 percent, in 1960 it will be 21 percent, in 1970 it will be 14 percent, and in 1980 it will be 10 percent. After 2000, tuberculosis can be eradicated in the United States. Because tuberculosis is indeed a preventable and controllable disease. In the past, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death from disease in European and American countries, but now it has dropped to seventh or eighth place. If our country does a good job in defense and prevents the spread of this contact disease, improves the social environment, increases resistance to tuberculosis, and reduces the prevalence of this disease, and works together, then the problem of tuberculosis will not be difficult to solve and can achieve practical results.

I. Defensive Principles:

(1) Early detection, reporting, diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of tuberculosis patients.

(2) Preventing the spread of infection and reducing the chance of infection.

(3) Preventing the multiplication and spread of tubercle bacilli that invade the human body.

(4) Increasing the patient's resistance, improving nutrition, and providing a good living environment.

V. Promote methods of preventive immunization.

VI. Defensive work should be implemented universally and strictly by government administrative power.

II. Defense Methods:

I. Defense Against Transmission:

(1) Health education: The general public in our country lacks basic health knowledge. Furthermore, they do not understand the characteristics, transmission, prevention, rest, and recuperation of tuberculosis. They act willfully, resulting in wider spread and more intense transmission. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that people have a correct understanding in order to make defense easier. Habits such as spitting everywhere should be especially corrected, which will be of great benefit.

(2) Tuberculosis Reporting: Preventing disease is better than treating it. To defend against transmission and reduce the chance of infection, implement reporting of tuberculosis patients publicly. Conduct strict examinations of early-stage patients, and immediately report discovered tuberculosis patients to the health authorities for management and isolation.

(3) Public Quarantine: Strict disinfection should be carried out for deceased tuberculosis patients. Because tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease, few people pay attention to it. The patient's rooms, utensils, and excreta should be strictly disinfected. For example, for milk management, dairy cows must be tested for tuberculin regularly, and cows with mammary tuberculosis should not supply milk and should be killed and burned. Milk should be disinfected before drinking to prevent transmission.

(4) Patient Isolation: Isolating one person protects everyone. All people with tuberculosis should be isolated for a long period of time and hospitalized for treatment, and should no longer be in contact with healthy people. If recuperating at home, they should sleep and eat alone. The patient's bowls, chopsticks, cups, and basins should be boiled and disinfected and used separately from others. Furthermore, the sputum and pus of tuberculosis patients should be burned with fire to kill the pathogens, and clothes and bedding should also be disinfected to eliminate the chance of infection.

(5) Handling Contacts: When a tuberculosis patient is discovered at home, in addition to sending the patient to the hospital for treatment or handling it at home, a strict examination of the patient's family members is an essential procedure. It is also easier to implement this matter at this time. This method can discover patients early and obtain treatment opportunities early. It can also detect the source of infection, eradicate it, and reduce the threat of tuberculosis.

(6) Family Care and Assistance: The general public lacks health knowledge, and the poor economic environment leads to the widespread prevalence of tuberculosis. In addition to paying attention to the compulsory recuperation of patients, guidance and assistance should also be given to the patient's family to avoid widespread transmission. Furthermore, conduct physical examinations of family members to prove whether they have been infected to prevent the spread.

(7) Free Diagnosis and Treatment: Most people with tuberculosis have financial difficulties. Therefore, diagnosis, treatment, and recuperation expenses should be provided free of charge so that they have ample opportunity for treatment and care, and avoid going to crowded places again, increasing the risk and source of transmission.

(8) Improving the Environment: More attention should be paid to droplet transmission. Places such as ticket offices, banks, store transaction counters, and public telephones are all places where droplet transmission is easiest, so ways should be found to avoid them. For public eating places, hotels, bathrooms, barbershops, etc., public appliances should be disinfected. The second is to reduce population density. Urban construction in crowded cities should adopt the garden city construction method to reduce population density and eliminate the chance of transmission.

(9) Labor Health Care: This is only limited to workers in dusty occupations and workers with frequent contact opportunities. Regarding the defense against transmission, the daily working hours should be reduced for workers in occupations prone to tuberculosis infection. Work should also be divided into sections so that there is ample opportunity to rest to avoid overwork. The equipment for this type of work should be improved as much as possible. However, it is best to let them change careers after a considerable period of work. During the working period, an X-ray fluoroscopy should be performed every three months.

(10) Marriage Restrictions: People with active tuberculosis often have severe illness due to marriage, especially childbirth. Married women with active tuberculosis should be prevented from becoming pregnant, or abortion should be performed before four months. People with latent tuberculosis, if they have catarrhal symptoms, fever, and have the possibility of recurrence, should undergo induced abortion. Nursing mothers with newly developed tuberculosis should stop breastfeeding infants. Such things should be prohibited by the government to avoid transmission. People with active tuberculosis should not marry, and married people should not cohabit.

II. Improving Life:

(1) Peace of Mind: If you are truly unlucky and get tuberculosis, don't be afraid, and don't think that life is hopeless and be decadent and sad. Instead, you should rest fully, recuperate quietly and patiently, abandon all pessimism and disappointment, and have an attitude that this disease will get better one day. A cheerful mind is an essential element for recovery. People who are pessimistic are adding the toxins of panic to the toxins of tubercle bacilli to accelerate their own death.

(2) Quiet: Psychological effects have a great impact on the disease. You should try to control your emotions and be quiet and not irritable. Because quiet rest can save people's energy and reduce the number of breaths. (Normally, there are an average of about 35,000 breaths in 24 hours. If you lie flat on the bed, you can reduce 5,000 breaths every 24 hours.) It also reduces the pressure of blood circulation and reduces the number of beats. The rate of metabolism in the body is also reduced at the same time. Saving energy and reducing metabolism is to reduce the consumption and damage of body tissues. Indirectly, it can increase the body's weight. Reducing the number of breaths means reducing the expansion and contraction of the diseased lungs. These two points are the cornerstone of treating lung disease.

(3) Moderation: Bed rest is not suitable for labor. Going to the park and playing mahjong is not rest. Unless you have a doctor's guidance, don't exercise. Don't cough. Coughing is the worst deep breathing. When you feel like coughing up phlegm, quietly exhale to get the phlegm out. Phlegm can come out without coughing. This is something patients should learn. Don't smoke, don't drink alcohol, don't spit on the ground, don't kiss children, etc.

(4) Environment: Human health has an extremely close causal relationship with whether the environment in which they live meets hygienic conditions. Since we cannot exist independently of the environment, if we want to have a healthy life and reduce the threat of disease, we must change the living environment and remove all things that can harm our health so that it can meet hygienic conditions. Directly reduce the chance of contact with germs, and indirectly increase the body's resistance. Then you can be healthy. The following discusses the environmental improvement of tuberculosis.

III. Recuperation Equipment:

(1) Location Selection:

A. Sunlight: When tuberculosis patients are recuperating, they should live in elegant and clean rooms, with windows often open so that sunlight can directly shine in and the air circulates fully. Because sunlight contains ultraviolet rays. It has a special effect on skin tuberculosis and can increase the body's resistance and promote vigorous metabolism. It also has a considerable effect on tuberculosis in the body. Therefore, sunbathing is possible, but you must follow the doctor's instructions. Not all tuberculosis patients can sunbathe. Quartz lamp therapy is also a type, and the principle is the same. When sunbathing, you should take off your clothes and do not separate yourself with glass, because most of the ultraviolet rays are absorbed by the glass. (To be continued)

### Elm Tree Filamentous Fungus Disease

— Wei Zhaoqi

Readers must find the term "elm tree filamentous fungus disease" mentioned in this article very unfamiliar, because not only do few medical books and magazines in East Asia publish it, but even European and American literature rarely mentions it. In fact, this disease is often seen in our clinical consultations, but because its symptoms are extremely easy to be confused with other symptoms, we have not paid attention to it. Last summer, when the author returned to Guangdong and consulted in the clinic, he encountered several cases and deeply felt that it had introductory value for the diagnosis of internal medicine clinical aspects, so he specially wrote it down, hoping that it would be approved by experts. However, the countryside is remote and few books are available for reference. Knowing that I have missed a lot, I am worried about making mistakes, and I hope that advanced people at home and abroad will not hesitate to teach me. As for the bacterial examination work mentioned in this article, I was assisted by Dr. Liang Junqing, and Qi dare not take credit for others, so I specially attached it here to show that I do not forget it.

According to the German name of elm tree filamentous fungus disease is Ulmenkrankheit, some people have written about it as early as 1800 AD. It is said that its symptoms are related to elm trees. Anyone who has been in contact with elm trees will suffer from a severe bronchitis. Unfortunately, there was no bacteriological examination at that time, so it was impossible to investigate the reasons in detail and verify them. Therefore, readers were half-believing and did not pay attention to it. After a long time, they forgot about it again. In recent years, several botanical experts have studied it and learned that elm trees do have a kind of bacteria that can infect people and cause disease. However, everyone's opinions are different, the names are different, and they have never mentioned the clinical symptoms in detail. There was a widespread epidemic of elm tree filamentous fungus disease in Louvain, Belgium in the past. Expert Schwarz conducted detailed research and learned that a kind of bacteria does grow on elm trees, and the general length is about 0.5-2.0mm, and sometimes it is 10-17mm long. If it is in a culture medium, it can grow to 80mm. This kind of bacteria is a filamentous fungus, often sparse and dense, gathered into bundles. At its end, there is a crown-like object to connect it. Sclrwarz named it Graphium ulmi (meaning elm tree filamentous fungus), and the western name Graphiomycoe in this article is taken from this. Later, Professor Ph. Biourge, G. Van. Cutsem and E. Brepo of Louvain University continued to study it and confirmed Schwarz's statement. And they had detailed introductions to the clinical symptoms. And Brec’o said that in patients with bronchitis, he found that the sputum contained elm tree filamentous fungus in 21 cases.

The occurrence of elm tree filamentous fungus disease is due to contact with elm trees, as mentioned above. In fact, people who have contact with apple trees or pear trees are also prone to this disease. In addition, if people who eat apples or pears are careless and send the filamentous fungus on the fruit peel into their mouths, they will also be infected with this disease. In addition, people who eat raw hawthorn or papaya are also prone to this disease. People in our country often like to pick up people's leftovers, thinking that eating apples or pears in this way can fully enjoy the vitamins in the fruit peel, but they do not know that the transmission of filamentous fungus occurs through this, which is regrettable. After this kind of filamentous fungus enters the mouth, it will occur after a short incubation period. At first, it is a common type of bronchitis, with itching in the throat, cough, and a small amount of transparent sticky sputum. Those who are infected are careless, thinking that they only have a common cold. However, because it does not heal for a long time, and the cough becomes more severe and has symptoms of asthma and spasm, at the same time, there is chest tightness, poor diet, and general movement and fever. Patients often think that they have tuberculosis. Even the consulting doctors think that they have tuberculosis, because if you auscultate their lungs, there are often bubbly noises, or their lung sounds are much lower than those of healthy people. However, if you examine it with X-rays, there is no trace of tuberculosis in their lungs. As for the sputum that is coughed up, it is mostly mucous and extremely viscous. If we pick it up with a matchstick, we can pick up the entire piece of sputum. And if we examine it with staining, we can find countless filamentous fungi in it.

In addition to the above-mentioned respiratory system symptoms, filamentous fungus can also invade various joints and cause chronic joint inflammation. In addition, filamentous fungus can also invade the skin and cause subcutaneous abscess. Finally, people who suffer from elm tree filamentous fungus disease often suffer from peripheral neuralgia and paralysis.

As for the treatment, the above-mentioned people all advocated the use of iodine preparations, saying that they were very effective. As for the amount used, it is one to three grams per day, and sometimes it can be increased to seven grams of iodine preparation in 24 hours. However, in my personal experience, Ammon joca is better, because it works quickly and has few side effects.

(1) Method to Prevent Cervical Cancer

According to the results of many years of research by B. Z. Cashman in the United States, it seems that the occurrence of cervical cancer is closely related to chronic inflammation of the cervix. The occurrence of cervical cancer is very slow, and it is often discovered unknowingly. It is too late to treat it when it is discovered. It is really a pity. However, according to the survey, it is known that all patients with cervical cancer have had chronic inflammation of the cervix for many years. Therefore, Cashman advocates that women over the age of 25 who have chronic inflammation of the cervix must be treated and cured as soon as possible. The occurrence of cervical cancer seems to be avoided as a result. However, Cashman also said that chronic inflammation of the cervix is ​​very difficult to cure. When necessary, the bottom layer electrocautery of the cervix must be used to remove the inflammatory lesions. (See the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, February 1945)

(2) Asthma and Other Allergies and Endocrine

According to C. Kousmine's report, endocrine disorders are closely related to the onset of asthma, eczema, rhinitis, joint rheumatism, and other allergic diseases. Kousmine has studied patients with the above diseases and found that a large amount of Gonadotropes Horman was excreted in their urine during the onset of their diseases. Therefore, Kousmine infers that if future endocrine research can be thoroughly understood, the above diseases can be easily solved. (See the Swiss Medical Weekly, Issue 8, February 1947)

(3) Using Ultrasound to Treat Various Diseases

According to the report of Czech doctor J. Zeman, the vibration frequency of ultrasound can be used to detect the location of brain tumors, and it can also be used to examine various changes in various internal organs in the abdomen, and it can also treat various rheumatic diseases. However, acute neuralgia and joint inflammation should not be used. (See the Czech Medical Report, June 1947).

(4) Infantile Paralysis is Rampant in the United States

We have discovered several cases of infantile paralysis in Shanghai (in fact, how many there are, because of the lack of survey statistics, so it is impossible to know) and have been very surprised. However, according to the Vienna Medical Weekly, there were a total of 2,600 people in the United States who suffered from this disease in 1946, of which 200 needed an iron lung to maintain their breathing work. It can be seen that this disease is rampant. The health situation in our country is of course worse than that in the United States. The gradual increase of this disease is even more expected. I sincerely hope that the health administration authorities in our country will quickly find ways to prevent it.

(5) New Drug to Treat Melancholy

Ugo Cerletti, a professor of neurology at the University of Rome in Italy, has invented a new drug specifically for treating various melancholy called Akroagonin. It is said that this is an extract from the brain of a certain animal and is very effective in treating the above diseases. (Note: The inventor is the first person to create the use of electric shock therapy to treat neurological diseases and is an authority in the field of neurology.)

(6) Productivity and Morbidity Rates in the United States

According to the statistics of the US Health Survey, in 1946, one person was sent to the hospital for treatment every two seconds. In this year, a total of (151,153,452 people in the United States were hospitalized due to illness, while in 1945, there were 16,257,402 people. One baby is born in the hospital every fifteen seconds. (There were a total of 2,136,373 newborns in 1946, while there were only 1,969,667 in 1945.) In 1946, there were 99,741 people suffering from tuberculosis (there were only 82,186 in 1945), which is more than the previous year.

### After the Vendors at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Stalls Were Banned, the Transportation Department Replied to the Reason for Taking Back the Self-Run Business

The stalls at Gu Station on this road were operated by issuing licenses before the war. After the victory, the original method was restored. Since the implementation, the effectiveness has been remarkable, so we planned to take back the self-run business in order to improve it. The reasons for taking back the self-run business are as follows: (1) Beijing and Shanghai are the political and economic centers. This road connects the two places and is of great importance. At this time, the bandit disaster is spreading. In order to maintain traffic safety, it is necessary to prevent traitors from mixing in and destroying things. The roadside stalls outside the road are of mixed quality and difficult to control.

(2) The licensed vendors outside the road sell unclean food and raise prices, turning service into exploitation, which is obviously harmful to the health and safety of passengers.

(3) This road is running catering services for the welfare of passengers, striving for comfort, economy and benefits, reducing the common psychology of the Chinese people who regard travel as a daunting task, and changing the impression of the railway by people in the society. Therefore, the scope of supply is expanding day by day, striving to meet the needs of passengers of all levels. For example, we have recently added the supply of snacks, tea and water for third and fourth class cars, and are planning to run soy milk and noodles, etc., with low prices and not for profit. In addition, the setting of dining rooms in various stations is based on the principle of simplicity and elegance, and the environment is beautified, so that passengers can get a moment of rest in their hard work and dust, which is not without assistance to their body and mind.

(4) Beijing and Shanghai are the gateways of our country, and friendly countries come and go frequently. From an international point of view, catering services are a very small business, but they affect the whole body and have a relationship of interests. Based on the above reasons, in order to ensure that every passenger can get benefits and every platform can reach the standard of solemnity, this road has to strive to reform the supply of food and beverage services, so the recovery of self-run stalls at major stations seems to be imminent.

However, it has been found that some of the stalls at each station are vendors who have returned to their jobs. Because they have been in business for a long time, it is difficult to change their jobs. In order to maintain their livelihoods, we are now finding out and appropriately assigning them to other small stations for business, or assigning them other jobs for relief. Thank you for your inquiry, and we hereby reply. To the Social Service Department of Shen Bao, Transportation Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration

### Life and Culture

— Jing Wen

Will a nation, like a fruit tree, grow from a young bud, flourish, bear fruit, and eventually rot? This question may be considered too naive, but I have some doubts, or rather, some anxieties.

Of course, I know that to answer this question, we must first clearly distinguish between life and meaning. Because there is individual life and there is the life of a race. Individual life, so far, cannot escape the iron law of evolution of metabolism, although modern science has made rapid progress, its ability is only to extend life, and it cannot create life or infinitely extend individual life. Even the latest artificial insemination methods only artificially inseminate the embryo of life, and do not truly create life.

As for the life of a race, it is certainly different. The life of a race can be infinitely extended, and not only can it be extended, but it can also undergo qualitative changes at a certain stage of its development and develop into another new life. The combination of sperm and egg into the lives of thousands of animals and plants is the result of infinite qualitative changes in life.

I don't want to talk too much about biology here. What I want to say is that although the life of a race has the properties of infinite continuation and development, it is not without conditions, and one of the main conditions is the ability to constantly maintain new blood. Especially for a nation that constitutes the life of a country, it is even more necessary to constantly circulate new blood, otherwise it will inevitably grow and rot, rot and decay, and decline.

But what can be used to measure the prosperity and decline of a nation? It is culture—the living culture of the nation. Therefore, it is particularly important to emphasize living culture, and there is a reason for this, because the culture of a nation has various aspects. For example, the historical culture of a country and a nation does not necessarily represent its real life culture. In terms of historical culture, China is of course a remarkable country, but just as the national life culture of today's Italy or Greece does not necessarily represent the culture of ancient Rome and Greece, today's national life culture of ours has also gone far from the cultural achievements of our ancestors.

Some people have called the Chinese a conservative nation. In fact, it would be alright if we could truly live up to the name of conservative. It's like the descendants of a wealthy family, if they can preserve their property to the end, they can still be considered worthy of their ancestors. But we can't even talk about being conservative now. It is important to know that conservatism requires the strength to be conservative. Because preservation does not mean stopping. In the world, there is only progress or regress. Being able to hold on under unfavorable conditions is not conservatism, but progress; not progressing under unfavorable or favorable conditions is not preservation, but regression.

If we say that Western England and Eastern Japan are both conservative nations, then the conservatism of the English is progressive conservatism, while we are regressing, and we cannot talk about conservatism. This is not saying to promote the ambitions of others and diminish our own prestige. If you just compare the differences in social customs between China and England, you can see whose national life culture is vibrant and full of upward spirit.

Speaking the truth may be satisfying for a while, but it is ultimately useless. Our national life culture has obviously approached decline from maturity, and the low mood and pessimistic atmosphere of the people are signals of this phenomenon. Those who are experienced in the ways of the world tend to see everything too thoroughly, while the younger generation sees everything too shortsightedly. Because they see too thoroughly, they feel that nothing matters; because they see too shortsightedly, they feel that there is no way. The psychological destination of both is despair and grief, which is manifested in the living culture as corruption and decadence.

However, although the modern life culture of the Chinese nation has tended toward the stage of maturity and decline, it is not without any way to save it. However, this method is not to restore the morals and minds of the world as some people advocate, but to create new ways of life to reform the dying social atmosphere, that is, to infuse new blood into our declining national life culture.

### Old Scenes of Shanghai

— Liu Yansheng

The land of gold and powder in Jiangnan, the home of silk fans in a foreign settlement. When previous people praised the scenery of Shanghai, they always thought that Shanghai was the first to open up to the modern trend, with singing and dancing everywhere, regarding it as heaven on earth. I have been a guest in Shanghai several times, paying much attention to the remaining charm of the past. Today, decades later, when I reread what people recorded, it feels like being in a different place. Master Fuxuan's poem says: "The cultural relics of Langhuan are left for continuation, waiting to take the traces in dreams in future years." Revisiting the past and present, visiting and seeking winding paths, embracing and touching the wind, this is also something precious in the local customs.

Wang Tanqiu, an old man from Tiannan, mentioned eight old scenic spots in Shanghai in his journal, and many famous people of the time wrote poems about them. The eight scenic spots are "Haida Rising Sun," "Huangpu Autumn Tide," "Longhua Evening Bell," "Wusong Misty Rain," "Shishan Night Moon," "Yebo Rowing Song," "Fenghua Distant View," and "Jianggao Snow Clearing," etc. Although there is no detailed annotation for these eight scenic spots, judging from the meaning of the words, they seem to be mostly inclined to wild waters, layered clouds, and vast waves, without expressing a single word about the prosperous scene of the foreign settlement.

In addition to these eight scenic spots in Shanghai, some enthusiasts proposed ten scenic spots in northern Shanghai, starting with the prosperity of the city center, and from the scenery, one can also know the social situation of Shanghai in the past. The ten scenic spots are "Guiren Watching Opera," "Xinlou Selecting Delicacies," "Yun Pavilion Tasting Smoke," "Zuile Drinking Wine," "Songfeng Tasting Tea," "Guixin Visiting Beauty," "Lou Ting Listening to Books," "Fei Che Embracing Beauty," "Night Market Lighting Lamps," and "Pubin Strolling in the Moonlight." The first two words of each of these ten scenic spots are mostly the names of famous venues in the past. Guiren is the Dan Gui Tea Garden, Xinlou is the Da Xin Restaurant, Yun Pavilion is the Qingyun Pavilion, and Guixin is the former Beili, and the rest can be deduced similarly. Looking at the descriptions of these ten scenic spots, most of them no longer exist today, and as time has passed and circumstances have changed, they are not enough to be a place that the society praises. For example, Yun Pavilion Tasting Smoke is used to describe opium, which is now strictly prohibited. As for flying cars embracing beauty, we can see the scene of that time in "Nine-tailed Turtle" written by Haishang Shushi Sheng, and "Biographies of Flowers in Shanghai" written in Shanghai dialect.

In addition to these eight scenic spots and ten scenic spots, Yingruan Magazine Jia further recorded as many as sixty or seventy bamboo branch lyrics about Shanghai by Yinjiang lyricists and Guyue Shanfang. The sentence of Yinjiang lyricists contains "The sea ban is opened for ten thousand miles of trade, and the thousand-year-old tombs are transformed into pavilions. It is pitiful that in the land of wine and flowers, there are Qinglai at night who annotate herbs," lamenting the present and mourning the past, with far-reaching intentions. Also, such as: "Another scene is a fairyland, and the fragrance of good flowers reaches the front of the dance building. The singing and dancing at night say it is the Neon Clothes Song, envying the banished immortals in the Moon Palace," and such as: "Lingbo steps lightly over the rainbow bridge, and the reflection in the spring pool is also charming. Afraid that the coming boat will hit the charming shadow, the people in the covered boat have already stopped rowing." These are all descriptions of the prosperous scene of Shanghai, which is spent in singing and dancing. Among the bamboo branch lyrics about the seasonal customs of Shanghai, such as: "Lantern balls and fiery trees make a noisy Lantern Festival, and the men and women are as noisy as a surging tide. The night is quiet and the people are sparse, and the slanting moon is cold. Whose pavilion is playing the xiao?" Now it is in the old year, and thinking of the excitement of the Lantern Festival back then, it can be seen that the peace is decorated differently from today. Also, such as: "Make an appointment to burn incense at the Yimiao Temple, and secretly draw the third spiritual sign. Secretly confide the secret thoughts, not afraid of God knowing, but afraid of sister knowing." In the description of customs, the voices of children are skillfully written to the tip of the hair.

In the bamboo branch lyrics of Guyue Shanfang, in addition to describing indulgence in wine and women, he can uniquely see things from a side perspective, and his words say: "A mirror polishes the vast sky for thousands of miles, and the building is combined with the reflection into the river. This country also has a cool environment, who is scratching his head and singing loudly?" Little do they know that decades later, the prosperity of Yangchang Shili is even better than before!

### Talking about Gift-Giving

— Yifeng

Here, let me first record a section of telegram:

"On New Year's Eve, a section chief of the Tianliang Office of a certain county in Yang'e brought New Year's gifts to the province and sent them to Wu Liangchen, the director of the Provincial Tianliang Office. Wu discovered that there was a gold bar and a pair of bracelets in the gifts. He then presented the original items to Chairman Wan, who was very angry and immediately detained the section chief."

In today's prevailing trend of gift-giving, I think this news is not fabricated. Originally, we are a country with complicated etiquette and attention to face, and the matter of gift-giving can be said to have a long history. Human relations are originally not to be overly criticized. However, the act of gift-giving is often used as a means once it enters the political arena.

Taking the above news as an example, Wu Liangchen's failure to be moved by the sight of gold bars is still a good official; the clean are self-cleaning, and the turbid are self-turbid, which can also be clearly proven here. If it is the "section chief," it is not worth asking about. A mere section chief can actually use gold bars and gold bracelets to give to his superiors, which is quite impressive; if we compare his deserved salary with this, we can easily understand what kind of official this is—in addition, subordinates can directly give gifts to their superiors, and the discipline of this officialdom can be imagined.

I remember before the Mid-Autumn Festival of the old lunar calendar last year, the so-called "No Gift-Giving Movement" was launched in the Beijing-Shanghai area, which was in full swing for a while. Naturally, it was aimed at this abnormal morbid state, but unfortunately, "the music was too high and few could harmonize," and it was not very effective. Therefore, at the end of the old lunar year, the packaged gifts in food stores were piled up like mountains, and the prices were often tens of millions, which were by no means affordable for a poor civil servant who was law-abiding and clean-living. Valuable items such as gold bars and gold bracelets are naturally even more unnecessary to talk about.

From another perspective, the gift-giving movement, after prevailing in the officialdom, is also an expansion of the act of private transfer of interests and bribery, which really opens the door for a bunch of shameless people to exploit. If this trend does not go away for a day, it will become extremely difficult to clarify the administration of officials. This kind of deal is certainly unwilling to do by people with a little shame and integrity, and therefore "good people" are even more difficult to stand in the officialdom, and establishing a "government of good people" and advocating "politics of good people" will also become empty talk. Therefore, this "gift-giving" trend is really a malignant tumor in the officialdom!

We really hope that the current heads of institutions can follow the example of Wu Liangchen!

### Things That Money Can't Buy

— Mao Yi

"Money can make the devil push the millstone," that's right, sometimes money is omnipotent; however, there is at least one thing in the world that money still cannot buy—that is emotion. When the nephew of the Mischief King Napoleon, French Emperor Louis Napoleon tried to buy a watch inlaid with a town stone for his wife Empress Eugénie, the tyrant who fantasized about ruling Europe learned the lesson that money is not omnipotent.

In 1852, an American, Charles Goodyear, participated in the Paris Exhibition with many rubber products. Because rubber was not yet noticed by the world at that time, his original intention was to show the importance and versatility of rubber. The things he displayed included rubber bracelets, rubber necklaces, rubber rings, etc., but the most exquisite thing was a diamond-studded watch. The whole city of Paris yearned for this watch, especially Empress Eugénie. She must get it, and she thought the focus of the problem was only the price.

But this watch was not for sale. Goodyear made this watch specifically for his wife, but she unfortunately passed away in England before the opening of the exhibition. Therefore, this watch has its great emotional value, which cannot be bought by Eugénie's power and the treasury of the French royal family.

In despair, Louis Napoleon did not hesitate to visit Goodyear in the civilian area of Paris.

"Mr. Goodyear, unless the Empress has that watch, our family will not be at peace," he pleaded.

Goodyear sympathized with the French Emperor's predicament. Finally, he came up with a win-win method—to make a copy. With the help of the royal diamond workers, he completed the work and presented the second rubber watch to the greedy Eugénie. While she was alive, Goodyear never displayed the original watch again, and she believed until her death that she owned the only diamond-studded rubber watch in the world—she thought money was indeed omnipotent.

And the American who started with rubber not only made an empress happy, but also made his own conscience at ease, and also made his wallet full.

### A Friend in Need

— Bronze Camel

The Brooklyn Federal Court recently concluded an unprecedented case of cooperation in distress. Two price administration auditors, Zuo Le and Terroir, were accused to the court of accepting bribes while exercising their duties.

The judge ordered the two to pay a fine of twenty yuan and a sentence of nine months. The defense lawyer stood up and said, "Because the family circumstances of each defendant in this case are special, I request the court to show benevolence outside the law and reduce the sentence appropriately."

The special circumstances referred to by the lawyer are: Zuo Le is the father of two children, and Terroir has four children. If the two are imprisoned at the same time, the family will suffer excessive hardship, which is self-evident. Therefore, the lawyer's suggestion is to request the judge to allow the two defendants not to be imprisoned at the same time, so that one party can make a living to help the poverty of the other party. "The two defendants have already agreed that when one person is in jail, the other person is willing to bear the family life." The result was as desired, and Zuo Le and Terroir could be sentenced in installments. The court further shortened the sentence to six months.

Terroir was designated to be imprisoned first, and Zuo Le was released on bail with 1,500 yuan in cash. The two colleagues have been working together for seven years. Because they shared the pleasure of accepting bribes and suffered disaster, they really became friends who can share adversity but not prosperity!

### Cold Temple Poetry Stone Mountain Zhang Engraving

— Yu Yifen

Zhang Yisun's poem "Mooring at Maple Bridge at Night," has been recited for thousands of years, and it is especially popular in Japan. During the war, the Japanese soldiers in Jiangnan all sang and chanted this poem. In Suzhou antique shops, all rubbings of this poem were searched and bought, even to the point of taking photocopies to respond. Yu Quyuan's newly revised "Records of Hanshan Temple": "There are no less than hundreds and thousands of temples in Wuzhong, and Hanshan Temple is named after Yisun's poem, and its name is not only well-known in China, but also recited in Japan. I have lived in Wu for a long time, and all Japanese literati have come to visit me. When they see me, they often mention Hanshan Temple, and they say that even three-foot children in their country can recite this poem." It can be seen that it has been deeply rooted in people's hearts for a long time. The first stone carving of this poem in the temple was written by Xun Gong (named Gui, courtesy name Yuyu), which is what Cheng Gong Pi's poem calls "Zhang Ji's inscription written by Neihan." It has been lost for a long time. The second stone was written by Wen Zhengming of the Ming Dynasty, without the year and month, four lines, each line has a different number of characters, large cursive script, and less than ten characters remain. The third stone was written by Yu Dianyuan, and the record says: "The west house is slightly repaired, and all the old steles in the temple are planted here. The Zhang Yisun poem written by Wen Daizhao is now incomplete, and I am asked to rewrite and re-engrave it." The poem is three lines, ten characters per line, the postscript is three lines, eighteen characters per line, cursive script, with Yin side, and the postscript says: "Hanshan Temple used to have a Tang Zhang Ji Maple Bridge Night Mooring poem written by Wen Daizhao. Over the years, it has been blurred. In the Guangxu Bingwu year, Zhongcheng Xiaoshi newly built several houses in the temple and asked me to rewrite and engrave the stone. Yu Yue." The back of the stele has eight lines, twenty characters per line, regular script, with the title: "Tang Zhang Ji's Maple Bridge Night Mooring is well-known, but the second sentence, 'Jiangfeng Yuhuo,' is quite doubtful. Song Gong Mingzhi's "Zhongwu Records" is "Jiangcun Yuhuo," which is valuable in the old books of the Song Dynasty. This poem was once written by Xun Gong of the Song Dynasty to engrave on stone, but it cannot be seen today. The inscription written by Wen Daizhao of the Ming Dynasty is also blurred, and the word 'Xia' in 'Jiangxia' cannot be distinguished. Zhongcheng Xiaoshi asked me to rewrite it, so I followed the current version, but the ancient version of Jiangcun cannot be ignored, so I wrote a poem and attached it to tell the viewers. Xun Gong's old ink has long been lost, and Daizhao's remaining stele cannot be touched. Fortunately, there is the "Zhongwu Records," and a thousand gold for a word is Jiangcun. Yu Yue." One side of the stele has five lines, thirty-two characters per line, regular script, with the title: "Zhang Yisun's poem has many differences in the world. In the title, Fengqiao was mistakenly written as Fengqiao in the old days. The "Wu County Continued Records" has corrected it according to the inscription written by Xun Gong. The poem 'Yuhuo' is sometimes mistakenly written as 'Yufu.' The "Complete Tang Poems" compiled by Yongzheng is based on this version, but the note says: 'Or make fire,' so it is not determined to be the fixed version of 'father.' The "Zhongwu Records" records this poem as 'Jiangcun Yuhuo,' which is an old custom of the Song Dynasty and can be relied upon. Tai Shi Qu wrote a poem to prove it. From now on, this poem is determined. In the Guangxu two years, I moved to Fusan Wu, and occasionally passed by this temple, lamenting its desolation, and repaired it a little, so I engraved Zhang's poem and Qu's poem, and asked those who read this poem in the world. Chen, Guiyang." Reading this, we know the year of the stone carving, and the similarities and differences between Jiangcun Yuhuo and Fengqiao. It is said that this stone was moved by the Japanese during the war, but now we know that it is not true. It is still in the temple. Mr. Hu Fan used the name of Zhang Puquan's committee with the same name as Yisun and asked him to rewrite it. It turned out to be his last work. Mr. had recorded the incident in this journal. Hu Fan has personally outlined it and sent it to famous craftsmen to engrave it on stone. It can be completed around the Yuan Dynasty. It will be sent to the temple, which is the fourth stone carving of Zhang's poem. Zhang's original sequel will be presented to the National History Museum as a permanent memorial. This is not only a beautiful literary relationship, but also a beautiful story of lakes and mountains.

Many poets in the past dynasties have praised Hanshan Temple and Maple Bridge. Here are three selections to see a glimpse. Wei Yingwu's "Visiting Hanshan Temple" (Visiting is also written as Staying): "The heart is cut off from coming and going, and the traces live in the world. Alone the autumn grass path, staying overnight in Hanshan Temple. Today, the county office is idle, and I think about asking about the words of the Lengyan Sutra." (Jun Suzhou Collection) Lu You's "Staying at Maple Bridge": "I haven't been to Maple Bridge Temple for seven years, and the guest pillow is still the midnight bell. The wind and the moon don't need to be lightly lamented, and there are still thousands of heavy Bashan from here." (Lu Jiannan Collection) Fan Chengda's "Maple Bridge": "Zhumen Baibi pillow the bay, peach and plum are silent, full of the house. There are floating areas on the wall and on the side of the road, sending people to the north and south to manage the sorrow of separation." (Fan Shihai Poetry Collection)

### The Squandering of Time

— Ji Mo

Among the several "strengths" that Chinese people deserve to be proud of, in addition to being able to cook a good dish and embroider a good pattern, being good at squandering time seems to be worth writing about in the history of the world's nations. The author once went to a postal stamp agency (not a post office) to buy stamps. I waited outside the counter for about half an hour before reaching the window, and the staff member was carefully writing an envelope. It is not an exaggeration to say that it took him fifteen minutes to write fifteen walnut-sized characters. I had already looked at my watch three times outside the counter and was getting impatient.

The strange thing is that the Chinese know how to cherish everything, such as cherishing printed paper, cherishing clothes, cherishing rice grains, etc., but they rarely see people regard time as "treasure" even though there is a saying "an inch of time is worth an inch of gold"? Whenever they have free time (actually, it may be time freed up after backloging official business), everyone spends it chatting while reading newspapers.

Also, some people are very frugal with themselves. I believe that there must be someone who walked from Jing'an Temple to the New World, or from Shanzhong Road to Baxianqiao because they couldn't get on the tram or bus. Of course, he saved a sum of fare, but he spent a lot of time to save money. If he could use this time to exercise, draft new plans, work in the laboratory, read useful books and newspapers, etc., how could it accelerate his personal and career success. What's more, time is something that is lost and cannot be regained!

Indeed, there is no shortage of people in society who advocate "walking instead of riding." I think they are too generous with spending time. As far as the author knows, the relatives and friends who have a little status in society have precise calculations for everything, but they don't care about small things like car fares. This is definitely not their plan, but they also deeply understand the purpose of "fully benefiting from time."

It may be hard to believe, but there are other times when we spend money to squander time. I finally queued up to buy a theater ticket, or bought it at a high price on the black market, and then found that it was a play that was not worth watching, and I had this feeling. I think anyone who loses money in any gambling has the same feeling.

In fact, the preciousness of time is often related to the success or failure of personal career or the rise and fall of the country. In the event of an important juncture, it is inevitable that the difference is "minutes and seconds," and the loss is "eternal." Recently, I read an article written by an American specifically for employees in the financial industry, which said that a salesman planned to win over a wealthy man to open a current account in the bank, hesitated for a while, delayed for a day, and then went to visit him. Who knows, this wealthy man suddenly died of an acute illness. Although this article is aimed at bank employees, it can also serve as a warning to general readers. In personal struggle, as long as you take a slight step forward, perhaps the fruit of success will be taken first by him. How can you not be afraid!

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (75)

Zhu Xi said, "You should rest!" Old Woman Wang smiled and shook her head. Zhu Qi still held Old Woman Wang's hand and said, "The boss really has good eyesight, he can find a good person like you to help, it's really rare." Old Woman Wang's hand was still casually held by Zhu Qi, just pursing her lips and smiling, "I said the boss has good eyesight, he can recognize a good person like Mr. Xu, you are really affectionate. Today the boss just didn't come back occasionally, and you are so anxious. What will you do if something unexpected happens to the boss?" Zhu Qi was so anxious when she heard this that she pressed Old Woman Wang's hand heavily and said, "Why do you say that? Do you think something will happen to the boss?" Old Woman Wang hurriedly said, "No, no, I'm just saying that." Zhu Xiao was already in tears, and said, "If something bad happens to the boss, my life will be over!" When she said this, her voice choked and she couldn't continue. Old Woman Wang took out her own handkerchief, wiped Zhu Xi's tears, and comforted her with a smile, "I'm just saying that, you two will always grow old together." Zhu Xi said, "I don't know why today, I just feel heartache, as if something bad is going to happen. Logically, I don't have to be so anxious if the boss doesn't come back, but I feel so uncomfortable. What time is it now? It's not dawn yet!" Old Woman Wang said, "It's almost dawn, please rest for a while." Saying that, she slowly pulled out her hand that was holding Zhu Xiao, put Zhu Xi's hand into the quilt again, tucked the quilt in, lowered her head slightly and said, "Sleep well, don't think wildly, I'll give you a massage again." Zhu Qi was so moved by Old Woman Wang's actions, she said, "You are so good!" Old Woman Wang pursed her small mouth and said, "What's so good about me? I'm not even as good as a hair of the boss!" Zhu Zhai saw that her words contained sourness, she couldn't help but stretch out her hand in the quilt, tightly holding Old Woman Wang's hand and said, "How are you not as good as the boss? I think you are the same as the boss."

### On Making the Best Use of Talent

— Wu Yong

There is an old saying: "With singleness of purpose and unwavering determination, metal and stone can be cleft." This is to teach people to strive forward in their endeavors. I remember a story from an ancient book, I believe it was about Li Bai. In his youth, he was idle and did not strive for improvement. An old woman, knowing he was a great talent, felt sorry for him because he did not cherish himself. To awaken him, she would grind an iron pestle on a stone in front of her door every day. Li Bai, seeing the old woman grinding the iron pestle daily, was puzzled and asked her what she was doing. The old woman replied that she was grinding the iron pestle into a needle. Li Bai was greatly moved upon hearing this and changed his ways, striving for improvement, eventually becoming famous throughout the world, his name living on forever.

The "Liezi: Quelling the Thirst" chapter recounts the story of Yu Gong removing the mountains: "The Taihang and Wangwu mountains, seven hundred li in breadth and ten thousand ren in height, were originally located south of Jizhou and north of Heyang. Yu Gong of Beishan, nearly ninety years old, lived facing the mountains. Annoyed by the cold north of the mountains and the inconvenience it caused, he gathered everyone together and planned, saying, 'Let us, with all our strength, flatten the hazards, and open a path to the south of Yu, reaching the north bank of the Han River, shall we?' Everyone agreed. His wife doubted, saying, 'With your strength, you cannot even diminish the height of Kuifu Mountain. What can you do with Taihang and Wangwu? Where will you put the soil and stones?' They replied, 'We will throw them into the end of the Bohai Sea, north of the Yin Earth.' So he led three grandsons who could carry loads, chipping at the rocks and cultivating the soil, transporting it to the end of the Bohai Sea in baskets. A widow from the neighboring Jingcheng family had a young son, just teething, who hopped over to help. A year passed. The wise old man of the Hequ River laughed and stopped him, saying, 'How foolish you are! With your remaining years and strength, you cannot even destroy a hair of the mountains. What can you do with the soil and stones?' Yu Gong of Beishan sighed deeply, saying, 'Your heart is so obstinate that it cannot be penetrated, not even as much as a weak woman and child. Though I may die, I will have sons. Sons will beget grandsons, and grandsons will beget sons. Sons will have sons, and sons will have grandsons. Generations upon generations will continue without end. And the mountains will not increase in size. Why worry that they cannot be flattened?' The wise old man of the Hequ River had nothing to say in response. The spirit who controls the snakes heard of this and, fearing that he would not stop, reported it to the Emperor. The Emperor was moved by his sincerity and ordered the two sons of Kua'e to carry the two mountains away, one to the east of Shuo and the other to the south of Yong. From then on, there were no more ridges or barriers south of Ji and north of the Han."

Such inspirational words, teaching people to strive, are initially unobjectionable. Mencius quoted Shun, saying, "What kind of man was Shun? What kind of man am I? Whoever makes an effort can become like him." This is to say that as long as one does his best, everyone can become a sage, also encouraging people to strive for improvement. However, such words are quite misleading, leading people to believe that as long as one has perseverance, there is nothing in the world that cannot be accomplished, without needing to consider one's own abilities. In my opinion, it is certainly not right to do things without perseverance, but it is also inappropriate to rely solely on perseverance without considering one's own abilities, as it is unlikely to achieve the best results. It seems that effort should be directed toward appropriate directions. "Heaven endows me with talent, which must be useful." We should have religious-like faith in this saying, but we should not expand its meaning to mean that I can do anything in the world.

Taking the story of Yu Gong of Beishan as an example, for a declining old man of ninety to want to move mountains seven hundred li in breadth and ten thousand ren in height, his ambition is certainly commendable, but without the "Emperor being moved by his sincerity," it would truly be a great tragedy. Yu Gong resolved to use the manpower and time of tens or hundreds of generations of descendants to remove the ten-thousand-ren mountains. Although we cannot definitively say that it would certainly not succeed, it would be regrettable to devote the energy and time of tens or hundreds of generations of descendants to the task of moving mountains, preventing them from doing other appropriate work. Furthermore, regarding the story of the old woman grinding a pestle: If we were to rely on her method to make all the needles we need, firstly, it would be a terrible waste of steel, and secondly, it would be too time-consuming, making it uneconomical. As for Li Bai, he was greatly moved upon seeing this and resolved to strive for improvement, but it still had nothing to do with the actual national economy and democracy. If Li Bai had a talent for mechanical invention, upon seeing the old woman's laborious and futile work, he should have improved the method of needle-making and then invented a sewing machine, which would be more beneficial to the people's livelihood.

However, those are just digressions. In short, we must recognize that "humans are not omnipotent" and should assess our own talents to do appropriate work, which would benefit both ourselves and others. However, although Mencius said things like "Shun was a man, I am also a man," he also said, "Some labor with their minds, and some labor with their strength. Those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with their strength are governed by others. Those who are governed by others provide food for others; those who govern others are provided with food by others." This shows that he did not truly want everyone to become a governing Shun; otherwise, if everyone were to become a laboring-with-the-mind Shun, the fact that there would no longer be a need for "governing" would be secondary. The most difficult point would be: without the laboring-with-strength providers of food, what would everyone eat? That would truly be "serving the public on an empty stomach." Mencius's words about "laboring with the mind and laboring with strength, governing others and being governed by others" are very likely to be misunderstood and cause resentment. In fact, Mencius's so-called "governing" is not the "six old officials ascending to the hall" type of governing, or the "prohibiting this and banning that, let everyone know" type of governing, nor is it the type of governing where generals like Qi Zaiyu or officials like Xu Jizhuang hoard every penny of public funds, but rather it refers to organizing national affairs in an orderly manner, which is "eliminating harm for the world and creating benefits." This kind of "governing others" work, when done seriously, cannot really be said to be "carefree." On the contrary, as long as the work of "governing others" is done well, those who labor with their strength, even if they labor year-round to provide food for those who labor with their minds, will be sincerely convinced and will not necessarily feel how hard they are working. Mencius's words about laboring with the mind and laboring with strength, in short, simply mean "division of labor and cooperation," which is logically sound. The problem with people today is that too many people do not ask themselves about their own talents and simply think, "Whoever makes an effort can become like him." Such effort, taken to the extreme, can lead to everyone having nothing to eat.

"Effort" is good, but as mentioned earlier, it is always necessary to choose an appropriate direction. Otherwise, it would be a waste of energy, and such a waste of energy is a suffering for oneself and a loss for society. It must be understood that "using an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken" is as inappropriate as "using paper scissors to kill an ox." For example, with timber: cedar has its uses, pine has its uses, lauan has its uses, and teak has its uses. Not using a certain type of wood where it should be used, or using a certain type of wood where it should not be used, results in a waste of timber on the one hand and an unsuitable product on the other. Zhuangzi's commentary by Guo Xiang says, "Those with small capacities do not require great resources, while those with great capacities cannot be used in small ways. Therefore, there is an ultimate division in principle, and things have complete extremes. Each is sufficient to fulfill its purpose, and together they achieve unity." It also says, "Things each have their suitability. If they find their suitability, where can they not be at ease?" It also says, "Although sizes may differ, when placed in the realm of self-attainment, things fulfill their nature, matters match their abilities, each fulfills its role, and ease is unified. How can winning or losing be considered in this?" It also says, "To seek externally what cannot be sought externally is like using a compass to draw a square, or a fish longing to be a bird!"

"Things fulfilling their nature, matters matching their abilities, each fulfilling its role" should be our ideal. Looking around, today's reality is too far from this standard. Lauan is being used as pine, pine is being used as teak, fish are longing to be birds, and compasses are being used to draw squares. Today's allocation of talent is like "randomly pairing mandarin ducks," and this waste of talent is truly regrettable. For this situation of "randomly pairing mandarin ducks," we urgently need to make a serious correction and give it an appropriate "adjustment." Our slogan is:

People match their positions,

Talent fulfills its purpose.
