### Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan: Commissioners Voted Enthusiastically All Day, Tong Guanxian and Liu Jianqun Elected Respectively

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] After a day of effort on the 24th, the Legislative Yuan elected its new President and Vice President. Tong Guanxian was elected President with 196 votes, and Liu Jianqun was elected Vice President with 202 votes. Both received more than half of the votes of those present, leaving the next highest vote-getters far behind. The thirty-first regular meeting of the second session, held on the 24th, began at 10:00 am. The enthusiasm of the commissioners attending was unprecedented in the second session. The original President and Vice President had both resigned and therefore did not attend. Chen Guyuan was publicly recommended as chairman. First, the report matters were approved, then the resignation letters of President Sun and Vice President Chen were read and accepted. Immediately afterwards, a temporary motion proposed by Luo Heng and 33 others was discussed, requesting a change to the agenda according to Article 23 of the Rules of Procedure to proceed with the election of the President and Vice President. The commissioners held extremely divergent opinions on this matter. Zhang Daofan, Zhong Zhaoxiang, Wu Wangji, and others belonging to the Reform Club rose in opposition, arguing that commissioners who were not present had not been notified in advance and that their right to vote should not be hastily deprived. They advocated setting another date for the election, while others noted that the current session was nearing its end and that many pending cases should be dealt with quickly, so the normal agenda should be followed. However, commissioners such as Huang Yuren and Wu Hexuan from the New Administration Club and the Democratic Freedom Society argued that the motion to change the agenda had been proposed in accordance with the law, that attending the meeting was an obligation of the commissioners, and that since the meeting had reached a quorum, the election could proceed. Those who were absent had forfeited their right to vote. Since the original President and Vice President had already resigned, the positions should not be left vacant for a long time while waiting for the commissioners to arrive. An election should be held immediately. The commissioners on both sides rebuked each other, and the dispute was extremely fierce. Order in the meeting was once disrupted. At 10:20 am, the chairman put Luo Heng's temporary motion to a vote. The result was that 188 of the 302 commissioners present voted in favor, and the motion was passed. However, commissioners such as Li Yu and Zou Shuwen from the Reform Club continued to express their opposition. Li Yu advocated that the election should only proceed after the normal agenda of this session had been completed. Peng Erkang advocated holding the election on the morning of the 25th. Hu Qiuyuan advocated holding the election on the afternoon of the 25th. However, Zheng Zhenyu argued that these proposals all violated the decision of the assembly to accept Luo Heng's temporary motion to change the agenda. Bao Huaguo then suggested holding the election on the afternoon of the same day. For a time, there was a chaotic clamor on and off the podium, with each commissioner arguing his case, many shouting angrily. At 11:00 am, there was still no resolution. Seeing that order was difficult to maintain, the chairman announced a recess. When the meeting resumed at 11:10 am, Yu Lingyun proposed changing the chairman, but this was opposed by Zhang Daofan and others and failed. Chairman Chen then put four opinions to a vote: (1) hold the election on the afternoon of the 25th; (2) hold the election on the morning of the 25th; (3) hold the election on the afternoon of the same day; (4) hold the election immediately. As a result, Bao Huaguo's suggestion was approved by 226 people (out of 278 commissioners present), and it was decided to hold the election in the afternoon. After reading the mutual election method, the meeting was adjourned at 11:30 am. The meeting reconvened at 3:00 pm, still chaired by Chen Guyuan. After the secretarial staff read the election voting and vote counting methods, the election proceeded smoothly beginning at 3:20 pm. Journalists were invited into the gallery to observe. The doors of the hall were closed, and commissioners who arrived late gathered in the lounge. The final voting took place at 3:30 pm, and monitors were appointed and staff assigned to begin the vote count. Voting ended at 4:20 pm. At 5:30 pm, Chairman Chen announced the results of the vote count: 351 ballots were issued, 349 ballots were cast, including 6 blank ballots and 12 invalid ballots, leaving 331 valid ballots. Tong Guanxian received 196 votes, Li Peiji received 123 votes, Luo Heng received 3 votes, Ahemaiti Heyayi received 2 votes, and Fu Sinian, Yan Huiqing, Batu Bilige, Kong Geng, Zhao Juxu, Xiao Baoyu, Liu Piji, and others each received 1 vote. In accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Legislative Yuan President and Vice President Mutual Election Method, Tong Guanxian had obtained more than half of the votes of those present and was elected President. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause. The voting for the Vice President election immediately continued. By 6:30 pm, the vote count was completed. 342 ballots were issued, 342 ballots were cast, including 5 invalid ballots, leaving 337 valid ballots. Liu Jianqun received 202 votes, Cheng Tianfang received 126 votes, Luo Heng received 3 votes, and Li Zheng, Aimeina, Wang Junying, Song Xianren, Bai Dacheng, and Tang Rumei each received 1 vote. Liu Jianqun was elected Vice President. The meeting adjourned with applause at 6:40 pm.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] After Tong Guanxian was elected President of the Legislative Yuan, reporters asked him to express his feelings. He humbly stated: "I did not expect to be entrusted with this important task, and I feel extremely apprehensive. I will entertain everyone in the coming days to discuss in detail." The newly elected Vice President Liu Jianqun frankly emphasized two points: first, to reorganize the Secretariat to provide thoughtful service to the commissioners; and second, to promote a spirit of open democracy, so that the commissioners can fully express their political views and jointly shoulder the important legislative responsibilities.

### The New Minister of National Defense, Xu Yongchang, Took Office Yesterday, Former Minister He Personally Supervised the Handover

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The new Minister of National Defense, Xu Yongchang, took office at 9:00 am on the 24th. Former Minister He Yingqin personally handed over the duties and convened the staff of the Ministry and the headquarters of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics for a speech. In his speech, He encouraged them to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary will and belief, to strive hard, to unite as one, and to persevere unswervingly, and to promote and enhance it. He also introduced Minister Xu, believing that under Xu's leadership, he will certainly be able to accomplish the tasks that he himself had not accomplished during his tenure. Xu said in his speech: "Under the leadership of Minister He, the Ministry has already established a good foundation. In the future, we will naturally follow the established rules and regulations." He also encouraged all colleagues to unite and work hard to fulfill their responsibilities. The full text of the speeches of He and Xu are as follows:

He's Speech

I have been in office as Minister of this Ministry for half a year. Recalling that I returned to the country from the United States this spring to report on my work and attend the National Assembly, just when the constitutional government was established, I was ordered by the President and urged by Premier Weng and friendly colleagues to serve as the first Minister of National Defense of the constitutional government. At that time, I felt that since I had served in the military for more than 30 years, and after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the completion of the surrender acceptance, I had sincerely hoped to be able to temporarily relinquish my responsibilities and be released from my military post, and contribute to the country's revival and construction as a citizen. Therefore, I repeatedly declined the post of Minister of National Defense, but given the situation at that time, it was necessary for me to reluctantly take on the difficult task and work together with colleagues. Therefore, at the beginning of my tenure, I worked diligently to improve the lives of officers and soldiers and enhance the morale of the national army, hoping that after solving these two most basic requirements, the military situation would gradually improve. However, after eight years of war against Japan and three years of suppressing the bandits, the difficulties in terms of human resources, finance, and materials can be said to have increased with time. In the past six months, due to various reasons, Yingqin has failed to achieve the expected goals in many aspects and has not fulfilled his responsibilities. I feel extremely guilty. However, all comrades and officers and soldiers of the national army on land, sea, and air have worked tirelessly and assisted me in carrying out my tasks under difficult conditions. Now, at the time of parting, I must express my sincere gratitude to you all.

Comrades, it is undeniable that the current situation is extremely difficult. However, at the time of parting, I want to encourage you with a word, that is, to carry forward the spirit of our revolutionary will and belief. Comrades should know that since revolutionary soldiers have dedicated themselves to the country and dedicated themselves to the doctrine, then we must work harder, unite as one, and accomplish our sacred mission in order to revive the country and realize the doctrine, especially in times of crisis. Only this spirit, this will, this belief, is the foundation of our revolutionary soldiers' lives. You must persevere in this spirit, this will, this belief, and promote and enhance it, then the future of the country and the national army will be infinitely bright. Now the new Minister, General Xu Cichen, has taken office. Minister Xu presided over the Ministry of Military Affairs during the Anti-Japanese War, and after the victory, until now, he has presided over the Army University. He has had extremely rich experience and outstanding achievements in the training of senior staff and in the use of troops and combat. In the future, under the leadership of Minister Xu and Chief of Staff He, you will certainly be able to accomplish the tasks that I failed to accomplish during my tenure. This is what I am gratified about at the time of parting. As for whether I will hold public office in the future, I will certainly continue to contribute to the country as a citizen and remain consistent with my comrades in spirit. Finally, I wish Minister Xu good health and all comrades hard work.

Xu's Speech

During this reorganization of the Executive Yuan, I was ordered to take over as Minister of this Ministry. At this time, I feel a great responsibility and am extremely apprehensive. However, under the leadership of Minister He, all facilities in this Ministry have reached an excellent scale. In the future, we will naturally follow the established rules and regulations. I hope that Minister He can continue to provide guidance on the business of this Ministry at any time, and I hope that all comrades will unite and work hard to live up to the heavy trust placed in us.

The National Army in the western suburbs is still controlling important strongholds inside and outside the 30-li area. Small groups of bandits are still lurking in the areas of Daxiao Jing, Caishen Temple, and Shifangyuan outside Guang'anmen. It is rumored that the 8th and 9th Columns of Lin Biao's bandit troops in the eastern suburbs have been transferred south to the areas of Xianghe and Anping, so Peiping East is stable.

Small groups of bandits occasionally appear in the Qinghe area in the northwest suburbs. There are no bandits inside or outside Tucheng in Peiping North.

Military sources said it was artillery testing, and there was no war on the front lines. In addition, the Peiping curfew will be moved forward again from 8:00 pm starting on the 25th.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 24th] A battle is being brewed in the Tanggu and Dagu areas. According to military sources, the main forces of the 8th and 10th bandit columns on the periphery of Tianjin have moved east and gathered on the periphery of Tanggu.

From the afternoon of the 19th to dusk on the 22nd, after three days and nights of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and were severely hit. The preliminary offensive launched by Lin's bandits against Tianjin has been thwarted. On the 23rd and 24th, the National Army's strong infantry carried out powerful searches, clearing out scattered bandits on the line from Nancang, Beicang, Tianqimiao, Dingzigu, and Liutan in the northwest of Tianjin, and Yixingbu and Dabizhuang to the north.

### Foreign Reporters Arrive in Bengbu to Interview the Suppression Headquarters; Zhang Yujin Explains the Battle Situation; Continuous Rain and Snow in Northern Anhui Lead to Stalemate in the War

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 24th] London Observer reporter Donovan, Daily Express reporter Smith, Daily Mail reporter MacDonald and others arrived in Bengbu this morning by train from Nanjing. In the afternoon, they visited the Suppression Headquarters here and were answered by Major General Zhang Yujin, spokesperson for the Suppression Headquarters, regarding their various questions about the current war situation. According to Zhang, due to continuous rain and snow in northern Anhui, the war has reached a stalemate. After the Bengbu-Suxian campaign, the communist forces regrouped in three locations for reorganization. Near Woyang and Mengcheng were three columns of Liu Bocheng's forces; near Lingbi and Sixian were two columns of Chen Yi's forces; north of Guzhen and near Suxian were a total of six columns from both Chen and Liu's forces. The remaining remnants, including more than 30,000 men drawn from Liu's remnants after the Bengbu-Suxian battle, were all along the Yongcheng-Fuli area, attempting to encircle Du Yuming's forces. According to intelligence, it is estimated that the communist forces mobilized no less than 700,000 troops in the Xuzhou-Bengbu and Suxian campaigns, and currently only about 250,000 men remain, of which about 100,000 are Liu's forces and about 150,000 are Chen's forces. On the Nationalist side, General Du Yuming commands a force of 120,000 men, who are currently in the vicinity of Yongcheng and Suixikou, forming a position with a diameter of about 15 kilometers, and have been confronting the communist forces in the difficult environment caused by the bad weather in recent days. The southern front Li Yannian Corps currently has five armies, of which three are stationed in the area of the Xie River basin, with heavy troops guarding Huaiyuan and the outskirts of Bengbu, and strong forces deployed along the Jinpu Railway in northern Anhui. In response to inquiries from the United Press field reporter who originally defended Bengbu and now visited Tongyun, Zhang denied that the communist forces had crossed the Huai River with their main force. His explanation for the Suppression Headquarters' move to Chuxian was that Bengbu is now the front line, and the command structure must be moved to the rear in order to advance and retreat freely and cope with possible changes in the current situation, and that the Suppression Headquarters needs to unify command in the future. The location of Chuxian is more suitable for military operations in northern Jiangsu and northwestern Anhui. A reporter further informed him that during his two-day trip from Nanjing to Bengbu, he saw at least ten trains transporting troops south every day, carrying a great deal of supplies. Zhang replied that it was the Huang Wei Corps going to the Jiangnan area for reorganization. The reporter then asked why so many supplies had to be transported south with Huang's troops instead of being left in Bengbu for use by other units. Zhang said that this was because the Suppression Headquarters did not want to leave more supplies in Bengbu. The last question was raised by a reporter from the Daily Express, who asked: In the event of necessity, how many troops can the Nationalists mobilize in the area south of Chuxian and north of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River? Also, how many troops are currently being used by the Nationalists on the Huai River front? Zhang told him that the Nationalist forces that can be mobilized north of the Yangtze River and south of Chuxian are about 300,000 men or more, and that the Nationalist forces recently used on the Huai River front, excluding central Anhui and northern Jiangsu, are about 100,000 men (note that there are at least three armies in central Anhui and more than 70,000 men in northern Jiangsu). After Zhang finished answering the questions, Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi immediately entered the reception room to meet with the reporters. Liu, in a frank tone, explained his feelings and hopes for the current war situation, which included two points: (1) In this campaign, the Nationalist forces did fail to coordinate properly in many aspects, resulting in the regret of not being able to wipe out all the communist forces; (2) He hopes that the Nationalist forces will launch an offensive soon to complete the task that has not yet been accomplished.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 24th] The Suppression Headquarters announced: (1) The Nationalist forces between the Xie River and Fei River area have been continuously sending out small units to patrol and search for the enemy due to the snowy weather, while the main force is taking the opportunity to reorganize on the spot. Once the weather clears up, they will continue to attack. (2) On the northern front, Du Yuming's forces are also holding their positions against the enemy due to the snowy weather, with only artillery battles taking place.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 24th] The Huai River battlefield has entered a state of standstill due to continuous rain and snow. It started raining here on the night of the 19th and did not stop until noon on the 22nd. Heavy snow fell again on the night of the 22nd, and by the morning of the 23rd, both banks of the Huai River had become a silver world. No aircraft activity has been seen in the sky for three days, and the movements of ground troops have also been greatly delayed. According to reports from the front, our troops crossing the Hui River are conducting a show of force search against the enemy. Only a few local communists are active between Guzhen and Suxian. Liu Bocheng's communist forces have fled to Fuyang, Taihe and other areas in the Yellow River flood zone for reorganization. There have been no major battles in the vicinity of Qinglongji, northeast of Yongcheng, for the past three days. Both sides are still holding their original positions.

### Editorial: The Continuing Problem of Gold and Silver Redemption

The gold and silver redemption measure, which lacked thorough technical consideration, has finally been temporarily suspended due to the tragedy that unfolded. Suspension is not difficult; the difficulty lies in how to improve it.

Judging from the crowds of people in various places vying to redeem gold and silver, the official knew early on that it would cause accidents. Sure enough, a tragedy unfolded in this city on the 22nd. Before the bank opened, tens of thousands of people, disregarding the curfew, were vying to redeem gold and silver, turning the Bund area into a sea of people. The area around the bank was so crowded that it was impenetrable, and the military police used all kinds of methods but could not maintain order, resulting in dozens of citizens being crushed to death or injured. For one or two taels of gold or forty-nine silver dollars, they were willing to risk their own lives. This foolish idea of "wanting money more than life" is both ridiculous and pitiful. It is heard that the government still insists on its redemption policy, but wants to improve the method. In fact, at present, in addition to thinking about improving the method, it may be worthwhile to consider the problem of the redemption policy itself!

From the perspective of the country's economic policy, it is not wrong in principle to use the gold and silver redemption policy to contract the currency and thereby stabilize prices. The recent price increases over the past month have not been dramatic, which cannot be said to be a success of the redemption policy. Moreover, yesterday, prices generally rose by 30 to 40 percent with only one day of suspension of redemption, which shows that gold and silver redemption has indeed achieved considerable results. However, excessive currency contraction and tight credit are first and foremost harmful to the city's industrial sector. On the one hand, they feel the difficulty of capital deployment, and on the other hand, due to the weak purchasing power of the people, actual sales are sluggish, and the re-production of various factories will be in a state of stagnation. Therefore, opening up industrial loans has become a consistent demand of the city's industrial and commercial sectors, and the government has no choice but to comply in order to rescue industry. Therefore, the outflow of a large number of industrial loans will offset the effect of the redemption policy of contracting the currency. Therefore, strictly speaking, the redemption policy has almost lost its meaning in its original purpose. Looking at the disparity between the redemption price of gold and silver and the black market price, it can be seen that continuing to implement the redemption policy, if not modified at any time, will inevitably only waste the expenditure of the national treasury's gold and silver, facilitate the redemption and profit of a small number of people, and have nothing to do with the lives of the majority of people. Even if gold and silver redemption is stopped today, it is not unreasonable.

However, we also know that the government's handling of gold and silver redemption this time is entirely based on the principle of "taking from the people and returning it to the people," which is why they came up with this method. Therefore, even if there are now many malpractices, they still have to continue to handle it and should not "refrain from eating for fear of choking." They can only plan and improve more on the technical aspects of implementation. It is heard that the government authorities are deliberating on improving the redemption method. We only hope that if the government has any revised methods in the future, it is better to be slightly cautious and not change the order from morning to evening, rather than seeking speed and having many loopholes.

We would like to put forward the following points for the authorities' reference:

First, the government should first consider how much gold and silver will be redeemed before making a comprehensive plan. Because, if we talk about the principle of "unlimited redemption" and say that every citizen can come to redeem, and the benefits of redemption increase with the black market, then in theory, the government must prepare 100 to 200 million taels of gold. Otherwise, only people in big cities like Shanghai will redeem, and the people in the interior and countryside will not have the opportunity to enjoy the right to redeem. How can this be said to be fair? Moreover, the government only redeems and does not collect, which is even more "generous" than Song Ziwen's gold policy of secretly buying and selling. How much gold and silver can block this bottomless "gold-digging desire"?

Second, public education personnel and military police are all people who perform tasks for the country. The situation is so serious, how can we let them all try to raise cash to redeem gold and silver, and temporarily put their duties aside? If the government is really rich in gold and silver and is willing to plan for them, why not give them a percentage of gold and silver when paying their salaries in three months (?), so as to avoid issuing gold yuan coupons and then letting them come to redeem them, which is a waste of effort?

Third, the price of gold and silver redemption should not be far from the black market price, or it can be adjusted according to the market at any time. Otherwise, redeeming one tael of gold in one day can earn 1,000 gold yuan, which exceeds his monthly salary income. Who would not want to squeeze in? If you go, I will go too, and the market price of the ID card will also increase. Suddenly, tens of thousands of people will be crowded in front of the bank, which is inevitable. For those who redeem, whether they are "scalpers" or ordinary citizens, we can only express our sympathy and pity them! To prevent people from redeeming again and avoid them from "killing themselves" for profit, the only way is to adjust the price of gold and silver redemption at any time according to the market price. Then, since there is no heavy profit to be made, people will not "take risks" to make gold-digging dreams.

### Redemption to Resume in the Short Term; New Measures Being Studied; Xu Kan and Yu Hongjun Exchanged Views Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] After the temporary suspension of gold and silver redemption, new ways to improve redemption are being actively studied by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and it has been decided to formulate improved ways and resume redemption in the shortest possible time. On the afternoon of the 24th, Finance Minister Xu Kan and Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun exchanged views on improving the method of redeeming deposits. On the morning of the 24th, Wu Xingzhou, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Chen Qingyu, Manager of the Beijing Branch of the Central Bank, also met again to discuss new ways to improve redemption. It is reported that the reason why the tragedy of people being crushed to death occurred in Shanghai's redemption was because the National Bank issued more redemption application forms than in other places, and each redemption applicant had a high probability of obtaining an application form. Therefore, the number of redemption applicants reached tens of thousands. To learn from past lessons, the method of issuing application forms will be properly revised.

### Supervisory Committee's Indictment Against Yangzi Company (Continued from Yesterday)

On November 18th, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued letter No. 1341 of the Municipal Machinery Department, briefly stating that regarding the case of Yangzi Construction Company hoarding goods, they were instructed to promptly conduct a thorough investigation of the company's books, documents, warehouses, and other storage locations, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the "Implementation Guidelines for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering" (9). Furthermore, regarding the rumor that the company hoarded many new cars that were prohibited from being imported at the Li Han Company, they were also instructed to investigate and report back. Consequently, the Police Bureau was ordered and Councilor Lin was assigned to investigate. According to the signed report, regarding whether the goods matched the declared items, a thorough inspection was conducted at each warehouse on October 30th and 31st, and the more important goods were unpacked and checked. In addition to discovering four types of unreported goods, the rest were found to be consistent. Regarding the legality of the goods' importation, each item listed in the inventory was checked against the import customs declarations on the morning of October 30th, and it was found that all the goods had completed customs procedures and were imported after paying taxes. Regarding the hoarding of many imported small cars at the Li Han Company, it was found that the Li Han Company currently had 52 new cars and 6 new trucks approved for import by the Transportation Control Committee, as well as 7 cars stored there. Manager Ge Teli of the company testified that the company was a foreign-run business and had no commercial relationship with Yangzi Construction Company. The Police Bureau also submitted a report. Upon further review of the "Provisional Measures for Handling Industrial Raw Materials and Daily Necessities Registered in the Inventory of Yangzi Construction Company," the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisory Office of the Executive Yuan issued letter No. Hu Jing Du Zi 886 to the Municipal Government on November 6th, stipulating that they should be supplied to the market at a limited price and requesting that the Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee coordinate the distribution. In addition to ordering the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus to comply and work with the Adjustment Committee to handle the matter promptly, they were also requested to take note. This is the final attitude and disposition of the competent authorities.

Regarding the cars stored at the Li Han Company, the report states that there are currently 40 Chevrolet and Austin cars, 12 Fiat cars, and 6 Chevrolet trucks, as well as 7 Chevrolet, Austin, and Fiat cars that have been sold but not yet picked up. However, according to the report from the Import and Export Control Committee, the company had been approved to import a total of 324 Chevrolet and Austin cars, but none of them were Fiats. The 12 Fiats listed by the company were all applied for import by Yangzi Construction Company. In addition, there were 3 luxurious Cadillac cars that were not listed. After inquiry, it was said that they belonged to Kong Xiangxi and Kong Lingkan. The statement in the Municipal Government's reply that Manager Mo Taili of Li Han Company testified that the company had no commercial relationship with Yangzi Construction Company was a lie. Upon further investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the Li Han Company was originally organized by British merchants in Shanghai and registered with the Hong Kong government in 1930, with a total registered capital of 1.5 million taels of silver, which was not fully paid up, or 1.2 million yuan in national currency at that time. Later, in October 1947, the registration was changed and reorganized. In addition to retaining three British directors, the remaining four original British directors were replaced by Chinese nationals Zhou Qiyong, Song Ziang, Qian Qifeng, and Li Yaosun, with Zhou Qiyong as the chairman of the board and Song Ziang once serving as the company's manager. These four individuals are all important employees of Yangzi Construction Company, such as Zhou Qiyong being the manager of the import department, Li Yaosun being the assistant manager of the import department, Song Ziang being the manager of the industrial department, and Qian Qifeng being the head of the finance department. Moreover, the capital of Li Han Company is very large, and changing more than half of the directors must involve new directors making huge investments. It is rumored that Yangzi Construction Company once acquired 80% of the shares of Li Han Company for US$750,000 to US$1 million, which is not without reason. Furthermore, the fact that the 12 Fiat cars imported by Yangzi Construction Company this year are stored at Li Han Company, while Li Han Company repeatedly and falsely denies it, makes the relationship between the two even clearer. The above is the entire situation of the re-investigation. (The following text continues on page 4)

### Security Council Orders Ceasefire in Dutch East Indies and Immediate Release of Indonesian President and All Political Prisoners Indonesia Establishes Government in Sumatra

[This newspaper report] New York broadcast: Singapore news: The representative office of the Republic of Indonesia in Singapore announced: The Republic of Indonesia has been established in Sumatra, led by Minister of Economic Affairs, Shafiruddin.

A US proposal that both sides withdraw their troops was rejected. The Security Council also resolved that the Netherlands should immediately release the Indonesian President and other political prisoners. Today, the British, American, and Soviet representatives all demanded that Dutch troops immediately withdraw from Indonesia. The British representative, Dunnin, announced his support for the American proposal, namely that both sides should immediately withdraw their troops to the positions they held before the outbreak of hostilities last Saturday. The Soviet representative, Malik, put forward another proposal, in addition to demanding troop withdrawals, also demanding the release of arrested Indonesian leaders. Furthermore, he advocated that a committee be formed by representatives of all members of the Security Council to handle this dispute and monitor the Dutch troop withdrawal. The French representative did not vote on any of the proposals in this case, because France doubted whether the Security Council had the ability to handle the Indonesian issue at all. The Dutch representative, Ballot, said: The Netherlands' "shocking atrocities" are beyond doubt, but although the Dutch country expressed sympathy for Indonesia, France's position was purely based on legal principles, because the Republic of Indonesia could not legally be regarded as a member under the Charter of the United Nations, and according to international law, Indonesia has not yet become a country. Therefore, the Netherlands' actions are domestic in nature, and the Security Council cannot interfere.

[United Press Agency, Paris, 24th] Today, the Security Council passed the Indonesia-Netherlands ceasefire case with seven votes in favor, zero votes against, and four abstentions. The countries that abstained were Belgium, France, the Soviet Union, and Ukraine. The vote on the troop withdrawal case resulted in five votes in favor, zero votes against, and six abstentions.

Therefore, I have come to Independence City to celebrate this Christmas in the family setting and in the hometown gathering. These family bonds extend tonight to the whole town, the whole state, the whole American continent, and the whole world. The sacred gathering of Christmas attracts all hearts to the family. We welcome the glad tidings of the first Christmas Day with one heart and one mind, with joyful emotions and respectful attitudes: 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.'

Our own struggles plant this feeling of good will, and good will is the true meaning of Christmas. This is peace and friendship to all who have good will. I would like to reiterate one point, that I will continue to strive for peace."

[Central News Agency, Independence City, 23rd, United Press Agency] Truman is currently spending the holidays in his hometown, but he is still concerned about the international situation. The President spoke on the phone with Undersecretary of State Lovett for ten minutes. According to White House News Director Ross, the conversation was about the general situation, undoubtedly including the situation in Indonesia and the recurrence of the Palestinian conflict.

### Pope's Christmas Message Concerned About World Situation

[This newspaper report] San Francisco Broadcast: Vatican News, Pope Pius XII recently delivered a Christmas blessing, briefly stating that at the beginning of this year, there were signs that the world could achieve true peace, but today it seems to be on the edge of another cliff. The Pope said: All the forces in the world are now divided into two opposite extremes. Although they all claim to seek peace, in fact, they have all placed peace in danger. The brutal war and the years after the war, although the Catholic Church suffered various setbacks, the Church was able to stand firm in the midst of storms. The Pope ended his blessing by blessing the whole world. The Pope's broadcast lasted half an hour, and many countries around the world broadcasted it. The blessing was translated into twenty languages.

### Nineteen Important Japanese War Criminals Allied Forces Intend to Release All Announce End of War Criminals Liquidation

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Allied Forces today released all unconvicted Class A Japanese war crime suspects in Sugamo Prison this afternoon and announced that the trial of all major war criminals in Japan has ended. The war criminals released today included Okawa Shumei, who was removed from the list of defendants last year due to mental illness. Other Japanese war leaders who were very active in China before and during the war, such as Kishi Nobusuke, Kodama Hideo, Nishio Toshizo, and Ando Kisaburo, were also included.

Allied Forces Communique

All war criminals released today were originally arrested and handed over to the Far East International Military Tribunal or similar tribunals to be tried for major war crimes. In view of the actual difficulties, the Allied Forces decided to try them for Class B and Class C war crimes, namely violations of the laws and customs of war and crimes against humanity. However, the International Tribunal acquitted several defendants of Class B and Class C war crimes (whose positions in the Japanese government were similar to those of the remaining nineteen war crime suspects), which became a legal precedent and ultimately led the Allied Forces to change their original decision to try these suspects for Class B and Class C war crimes. According to the announcement made by the Allied Forces today, the above-mentioned war crime suspects had a very short time in politics, "so that their Class B and Class C crimes, if based on their responsibilities in their official positions, would be difficult to establish." The announcement today also stated that after "thorough consideration of all relevant factors," the Allied Forces decided not to initiate any further trials.

List of War Criminals

The list of the nineteen Japanese Class A war criminals released today is as follows: (1) Anno Nobuki (former Minister of Interior), (2) Ando Kisaburo (Tojo Cabinet), (3) Amano Eiji (former Foreign Minister), (4) Aoki Kazuo (Tojo Cabinet Minister of Justice), (5) Goto Fumio (former Minister of State and Minister of Interior), (6) Honda Kumitaro (former Ambassador to China), (7) Ishihara Koichiro (industrial leader), (8) Iwamura Michiyo (Tojo Cabinet Minister of Justice) (9) Kishi Nobusuke (Tojo Cabinet Minister of Commerce), (10) Kodama Hideo (notorious Japanese Navy spy in Shanghai, and leader of the Kodama organization in China), (11) Kazuo Noku (leader of the Japanese Black Dragon Society), (12) Nishio Toshizo (former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China), (13) Okawa Kiyoshiaki (publisher and propagandist of extreme nationalism), (14) Kawamura Kazuyoshi (former leader of various Japanese nationalist organizations), (15) Suma Yakichiro (former Japanese Ambassador to Spain), (16) Takahashi Mitsugi (former Commander of the Japanese Naval Fleet), (17) Tani Masayuki (former Japanese Foreign Minister), (18) Terashima Ken (Tojo Cabinet Minister of Railways), (19) Tada Shun (former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army). Among the nineteen people, Li Duoxiong and Tada Shun died of illness in prison this month.

### Senate Assembly Three Important Issues How to Defend Greater Shanghai Balance Municipal Financial Budget Set Standard for Calculating Rent

According to the spokesperson of the Senate, as of yesterday, more than 30 senators had completed the registration procedures with the secretariat. No formal motions have been submitted yet. It is generally expected that the three major focuses of discussion in this assembly will be local defense, budget balancing, and rent issues. The municipal budget for 1949, although compiled by the municipal government, has not yet been sent to the Senate for review. Regarding the rent issue, the Shanghai General Federation of Tenants held a rent standard review meeting yesterday, attended by more than 100 tenant representatives from various neighborhoods. After careful discussion, the final decision was that the maximum rent limit in the city would be 0.5 Gold Yuan per pre-war legal currency for residential buildings and 0.65 Gold Yuan per pre-war legal currency for commercial buildings. The calculation method for this standard is based on the original resolutions of 7,000 times and 9,000 times passed by the Senate in March of this year. After converting to Gold Yuan, it is multiplied by the mixed average multiple of the city's workers' index and public education salaries from August to December of this year. After the association decided on the above standard, it will formally suggest that the Senate adopt it in this assembly and request the relevant authorities to announce its implementation. It is also learned that after the death of Senator Shao Yongsheng, the secretary-general of the Tenants' Federation, in a plane crash, the association re-elected standing committee member Ma Junshuo as the secretary-general and Li Yushu as a standing committee member yesterday.

[Another News] All subordinate agencies of the Central Government stationed in various places are legally entitled to refuse to answer any inquiries from local public opinion institutions. In the past, when the Shanghai Senate held a general assembly for a long time, discussions involving central government agencies stationed in Shanghai, except for the Materials Supply Bureau and the Direct Tax Bureau, which were invited to send personnel to attend and explain, many other relevant agencies refused on various pretexts, encountering obstacles in the work of deliberation. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance, in order to take into account the actual needs of local public opinion organs for deliberation, recently ordered the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau and other subordinate agencies of the Ministry stationed in Shanghai to send personnel to attend and answer questions at any time when the Senate holds a general assembly and raises relevant inquiries.

### Allowance for Families of New Recruits to Be Raised Locally by District Guarantees; Municipal Conscription Association Explains Reasons for Separate Fundraising

The public has been unclear about the collection of family allowances for new recruits by district guarantees this time, and many have written to the Conscription Association and various newspapers to inquire about the matter. It is now understood that the fundraising for the family allowance for new recruits is not handled by the Conscription Association, and the funds collected are not handed over to the Conscription Association for distribution. Instead, the district guarantees are raising funds themselves for the purpose of providing family allowances for new recruits in their respective districts. The method of collection is based on the "Key Points for Shanghai Districts to Raise and Provide Family Allowances for New Recruits" established by the Civil Affairs Bureau. It is noted that the Conscription Association collected family allowances for new recruits in the first half of the year, and recently various dance halls in the city have also been collecting family allowances for new recruits. The public may be confused by this separate fundraising by district guarantees. According to the Conscription Association, the first batch of new recruits for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948] was planned to be 6,000. At that time, to encourage enlistment, it was decided to issue each new recruit 20 *shi* (石) of rice as a family allowance (converted and issued according to the household rice price). The municipal government announced the "Measures for Collecting Family Allowances for New Recruits in the 37th Year", and the rice (divided into five grades and converted according to the household rice price) and *fabi* (法幣, old legal tender) (divided into three grades) were assessed and collected from current servicemen and households with men of conscription age who had not been drafted. At that time, according to the assessment and collection figures of each district, it was roughly sufficient for the 6,000 new recruits. However, later, due to the continuous rise in rice prices and the inverse relationship between the collection of family allowances and the formation of new recruits (i.e., when rice prices were low, collection was more prosperous but there were fewer soldiers, and when prices were high, there were more soldiers but no collection), the collected family allowances for new recruits were completely exhausted when 3,000 new recruits were recruited. The issuance of the family allowance for new recruits started at 70 million *yuan* per person in July and increased to 300 million *yuan* per person. Later, with the currency reform, the Conscription Association tried to use the preferential treatment money for delaying conscription of strong men (special funds for preferential treatment of conscripted families) to continue the recruitment, and also increased the family allowance to 200 gold *yuan* per person. However, due to the relationship between prices, there were still no volunteers to enlist. At the same time, the city was assigned to recruit another 4,400 new recruits, adding up to 7,000 including the previous arrears. The central government was urging the recruitment urgently, and the previous family allowance had ended. Although many plans were made, none were successful. Until the beginning of November, the 26 dance halls in the city collected the money on behalf of the government through tea fees, but the amount was limited and could only maintain the number of 200 *yuan* per person, and there was no way to increase it. With only 200 *yuan* of family allowance, it was difficult to expect volunteers to join the army. The Civil Affairs Bureau, in response to the unanimous request of the district guarantees and the actual needs, promulgated self-raised subsidy measures, and each district raised family allowances separately in order to successfully recruit and complete the recruitment quota. In addition, the collection, storage, distribution, and supervision of the fundraising requirements have specific regulations. All sectors can monitor them at any time. If there are cases of corruption or fraud, they should be reported as much as possible to prevent abuses.

### Supervisory Committee's Impeachment Document Against the Yangzi Company (Continued from Page 2)

(F) Yangzi Construction Company should be subject to suspension of business, and its judicial part should be transferred to the court for investigation.

(1) It is found that Yangzi Construction Company was established in April of the 5th year of the Republic [i.e., 1916] with a capital of 100 million *fabi*. Although the capital was increased to 1 trillion *fabi* in July of the 36th year [i.e., 1947], the hoarding of goods reached such a large amount. Even if the current value is underestimated, it is about 20 million gold *yuan*, equivalent to 600 trillion *fabi*. Compared with its second year's capital, it is about 60,000 times. It is hard to believe unless the general manager of the company, Kong Lingkan, has special powers and exploits by hook or by crook. The total income tax paid in the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947] was only 24.420.000.000 *fabi*, and the profit tax was 5.082.400 *fabi*. The above two tax amounts were only 177.414.400 *fabi* estimated at six times in the first half of the 37th year [i.e., 1948]. The business tax paid in the 35th year of the Republic [i.e., 1946] was 1.877.919 *fabi*. In the first half of the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947], it was 26.496.800 *fabi*. In the second half of the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947], the special business tax was changed. The assessed tax amount was 28.557.867 *fabi*. In the first half of the 37th year [i.e., 1948], it was 132.47 gold *yuan*. According to the income tax law, if the company's profit income reaches more than 300% of the capital, 40% tax will be levied. The excess profit tax is levied at 22% of the excess amount if the profit exceeds 120% of the capital. The company refuses to submit accounting books, and there is no way to investigate. The true profit figures are unknown. However, according to the current inventory, its profit is about 560,000 times its capital of 1 billion *yuan*. Even if the value of the *fabi* at the end of the 36th year is assumed to be 200 times the current gold *yuan* equivalent *fabi* value, there is still a net profit of 2300 times. According to the income tax law, the sum of 300% or more of the profit and 120% of the profit tax is 62%. That is, the *fabi* tax payable in the 37th year should be more than 189 billion. The company only paid more than 177 million *yuan* according to the assessment in May of this year, which is only 1/1000. If the profit of the 35th year is retroactively calculated, it is assumed to be 5% (the ratio of prices at the end of the 36th year to the 35th year is 20 to 1). Fifty percent of the above profit figures are regarded as half of the 36th year, which should be 780 times its capital of 100 million *yuan*, and the amount payable is no less than 5 billion *yuan*. However, what it paid was more than 29 million *fabi*, which is only 56/1000. The special business tax in the first half of this year was only 132.47 gold *yuan*. It can be inferred from this. It is unknown whether there is any collusion with the tax authorities. However, it is obvious that the company relies on its power to evade taxes. In addition, after reviewing and verifying the company's import tax rates, it was found that the company falsely used early tax bills and pointed to them as certificates of newly imported inventory. There are as many as seven or eight types, and some have a time difference of up to two years. Not only has the fact of mislabeling become a definitive case, but it is also sufficient to prove that the company has indeed engaged in illegal smuggling and tax evasion. Moreover, among the inventories, some are prohibited from being imported according to import and export trade regulations, and some are temporarily not allowed to be imported, and there are more than 20 types. According to its own claim, some of them were imported before the import and export trade regulations were announced in November of the 35th year, but there are still more than ten types, which it first reported as imports in the 36th and 37th years. There is no doubt that it has undermined the law and sought private interests.

Moreover, the company's inventory is mostly purchased in the 35th and 36th years and has not yet been sold on the market. For example, sugar and kerosene have been in stock for more than a year. It is difficult to say that it is not a behavior of hoarding and speculation. Moreover, industrial and commercial management laws have stipulated that "Any importer and exporter who operates more than two types of businesses should immediately join the respective trade associations," and the Shanghai Municipal Warehouse Inspection Implementation Guidelines stipulates that "Each importer should report the quantity of designated goods, import date, and storage warehouse location to the competent trade association on a monthly basis, and report to the Social Affairs Bureau." As of October 19th of this year, the company has not joined the trade associations of Western medicine, pigments, chemical raw materials, foreign wine and canned food, rubber, paper, bicycle, hardware, iron, Chinese and foreign department stores, glass, department stores, sugar, wine and grease, wireless electricity, leather and shoe materials, and other trade associations, but has already purchased goods operated by the above industries and has a large amount of storage, but does not supply them to the market for sale. Its illegal profit-making and hoarding are also undeniable.

In terms of the company's imported cars, in addition to the 12 Fiat cars stored by the Li Han Company, there are also many Fiat and Cadillac cars. When inquiring with the Transportation Control Committee, the Li Han Company learned that the truth had been revealed and admitted that it had purchased six Fiat cars and twelve cars from Yangzi Construction Company twice on April 17th and July 15th of this year. That is to say, in addition to the 12 Fiat cars imported with the certification of the Transportation Control Committee, Yangzi Construction Company has imported at least six or more Fiat cars and several Cadillac cars. Otherwise, how could it transfer them to the Li Han Company? However, the Transportation Control Committee claimed that it had not issued permits for the Fiat and Cadillac cars, and there is indeed a possibility of smuggling. After reviewing the company's copied foreign exchange list, it was found that on January 4th of the 26th year [i.e., 1937], the Bank of China paid £15,405 and 12 shillings to purchase 49 Austin cars. In addition, there are no records of foreign exchange approval for Fiat and Cadillac cars. How did the foreign exchange for the Fiat and Cadillac cars come from? Isn't it the same as Rong Hongyuan's speculative trading? (Refusal to submit account books makes it impossible to investigate accurately). Moreover, if the relationship between Yangzi Construction Company and Li Han Company is as described in the previous section, in today's era when the country has just gained independence and equality, a famous and well-known company in China and abroad does not hesitate to seek refuge with foreigners and use the name of foreign businessmen to make illegal profits. Its intention is even more punishable.

In addition, hoarding a large number of newspapers, claiming to be owned by *Shishi Xinbao* [Current Affairs News] and *Dalu Bao* [Mainland News], the competent authorities have not investigated, whether it is also Li Han Company's full cover-up for Yangzi Construction Company's cars, which is quite suspicious. After all, the relationship between Kong Lingkan and the two newspapers is well known. *Shishi Xinbao* went on strike last year due to difficulty in paying wages, but now it can purchase and store so many newspapers, which is also suspicious. The company is still suspected of hoarding under a false name for this large number of newspapers. As for its submission of an inventory list in pure English that does not conform to the current official document format directly to the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office without filling out the material registration form and submitting it to its competent authority, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the fact that all documents and account books are in English, its disregard for law and national system is particularly outrageous. In short, Yangzi Construction Company relies on its power to violate the law, and its crimes of evading smuggling, hoarding, and making profits are all complete. It should be severely punished. It should immediately request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to revoke its industrial and commercial registration certificate and suspend its business. As for the part that violates the judiciary, it should be transferred to the court for investigation in accordance with the law. (Continued on Page 7)

### Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of China Merchants Bureau, Resigns

Xu Xueyu Visited Beijing Yesterday to Ask for Instructions

Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of China Merchants Bureau Shipping Company and Chairman of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, resigned because of the unfortunate sinking of the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangya steamer this time, which resulted in thousands of deaths and created an unprecedented tragedy in the history of China's shipping industry. Moreover, most of the passengers were fellow Ningbo natives, so the Ningbo Association was in charge of the aftermath. Liu was also the person in charge of both parties and felt quite difficult. Recently, the matter of lawyer Wang Peiji caused a misunderstanding between the China Merchants Bureau and the Ningbo Association. Liu formally submitted his resignation to the Board of Directors of China Merchants Bureau to avoid being caught in the middle.

### Forged Cigarette Trademark Tax Stamps: Eight Arrested, Interrogated, and Sentenced

[Report from Our Newspaper] Hu Xin Da, who worked as a seal engraver, plotted illegal profits and was instigated by broker Zou Ji Gen to forge trademark steel stamps for cigarettes of brands such as Qianmen and British American Tobacco, selling them to others for the purpose of counterfeiting trademarks. He was also entrusted by broker Zhang Rui Xiang to forge trademark steel stamps for cigarettes of brands such as San Paotai, British American Tobacco, and Qianmen. Zhang Rui Xiang also bought from Chen Guang Hui, a small factory worker, 2,500 pieces of San Paotai cigarette raw materials that were stolen from the Yizhong Tobacco Company by the fugitive Wu Dao and hidden at Chen's place, and then transferred them to Zou to be sold to Zhang Qi Liang, who was aware of the situation. He then resold them to Jiao Wen Xiu and Zhao Tian Xiang. In addition, Zou Ji Gen forged Bank brand cigarette cases and instigated Chen Rui Sheng and the fugitive Xie Wei Hao to forge cigarette tax stamps, and hid a roll of forged cigarette tax stamps and a package of forged Bank brand cigarette cases at Zhang Qi Liang's place. After police investigation, a forged San Paotai cigarette trademark steel stamp was quickly found at Hu Xin Da's place. A small package of San Paotai cigarette soft packs, six stacks of cigarette tin foil, a small amount of cellophane, five stacks of cigarette small seals, and a stack of cigarette head paper were found at Jiao Wen Xiu and Zhao Tian Xiang's place. A roll of forged cigarette tax stamps was found at Zhang Qi Liang's place. A lithographic plate used to forge cigarette tax stamps and a roll of forged cigarette tax stamps were found at Xie Wei Hao's home. All were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The defendants Hu Xin Da and others were charged with forging seals, valuable securities, obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, and receiving stolen goods. A public prosecution was filed with the District Court. After several trials by Judge Ou Sheng He of the District Court, the verdict was announced yesterday: Hu Xin Da was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for continuous forgery of seals; Zou Ji Gen was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for being a receiver of stolen goods, two months of imprisonment for deceiving others and forging registered trademarks, and three months of imprisonment for instigating the forgery of stamp tax tickets, to be served concurrently for a total of six months; Zhang Rui Xiang was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for instigating the forgery of seals and three months of imprisonment for knowingly trading stolen goods, to be served concurrently for a total of four months; Chen Guang Hui was fined 500 yuan for harboring stolen goods; Jiao Wen Xiu, Zhao Tian Xiang, and Zhang Qi Liang were each fined 500 yuan for knowingly buying stolen goods; Chen Rui Sheng was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for helping to forge stamp tax tickets.

### Christmas Sketches

The meaning of Christmas is to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. All Christians, whether Chinese or foreign, will sincerely hold prayer ceremonies.

In Shanghai, from this day onwards, a winter carnival is launched. Manufacturers and businesses, regardless of men, women, old, or young, and regardless of whether they are Christians or not, many have already prepared how to welcome this year's Christmas.

Originally, when people reach the end of the year, even if they are dissatisfied with their actual lives, they always have a new hope for the coming of the new year. Christmas can be said to be the opening of the celebration of the new year. Moreover, at this time and place this year, tens of millions of people have similar hopes and wishes, although everyone's enthusiasm has been reduced due to the unstable environment. But for this annual festival, there are always some joyful emotions, and several routine decorations are still unavoidable.

In recent days, Shanghai's shops have been busy adding goods and decorating their shop windows. Inside, there are "Santa Claus" with white beards and red robes, and the background of cotton representing white snow is so clean and quiet. The green holly trees, red, white, and green, just the colors inside the shop windows can make this bleak season appear lively and brilliant.

The prices of goods these days are also roughly 30-40% higher than in the previous days. Merchants taking advantage of this opportunity to raise prices for profit is naturally one of the reasons, but the sudden buying phenomenon in the market, which has changed the normal state of supply and demand, is an even greater reason for the rise in commodity prices.

Needless to say, among the many businesses, restaurants and entertainment venues are inevitably full and have the most prosperous business. The "Christmas dinner" this year, although various hotels have published advertisements in various newspapers and have musical performances, singing and dancing, and technical performances to help, and some even have "valuable gifts" for guests, the price per guest is not specified, and it may be disappointing for the general "poor scholars." However, we still clearly remember that the highest price limit for last year's Christmas dinner was 120,000 法币, which was only four cents in gold yuan. When I mention it, I can't help but feel a little emotional.

In addition, fashion stores, toy stores, food and candy stores always break the annual sales records on Christmas. A net-woven winter sock filled with a few lead toys and other things, plus a ping-pong ball and a few candies, sells for tens of yuan to dozens of yuan. In the toy departments of several large department stores, the crowds are dense. How many millions of yuan worth of toys have been sold in the past few days?

At least, the economic downturn in the market has been temporarily swept away. Merchants are all smiling and busy for a while, adding a few digits to their wealth. However, it is the postal workers and postmen who are busy for nothing. The number of letters and greeting cards is several times higher than usual, and they are simply too busy to breathe.

In this concentrated consumption festival, the difference between rich and poor is even more profoundly evident. The poem says: "Some are happy, some are sad," which is an accurate portrayal.

Facing this annual festival, the rich can of course enjoy themselves to the fullest, while the poor are economizing on food and clothing and enduring the oppression of hunger and cold; but we believe that they are all attracted by a beautiful gift that strengthens the will to live, which is definitely not the things in the shop windows, but the new hope for next year!

### Santa Claus

In winter, a gust of north wind makes people afraid to go out. But if you are interested, it is also very good to stroll down the street and admire the shop windows. The snow scenes made of cotton, the small clocks made of aluminum sheets, and the green paper holly trees make up a beautiful winter scene. There is also an obese, white-haired, red-clothed old man who is telling you that Christmas is coming soon. The old man is carrying a large bag full of candy and toys, which are most welcome to the children.

The red-clothed, white-haired Santa Claus was created for children. Originally, no one knew whether he was tall or short, fat or thin. In primitive times, all ethnic groups had various imagined gods. Santa Claus evolved from the gods who protected children. In Europe, he is called "Saint Nicholas," who is a tall, thin-faced, and dignified old man. After moving to the New World, he was renamed Saint Santa Claus, and his body became fatter and fatter day by day, becoming a bloated fat old man.

It is said that Saint Nicholas was a devout Christian who was born in 356 AD and died in 426 AD. He was kind and approachable. When others encountered difficulties and asked him for help, he always agreed. Once, on the eve of Christmas, an old man next door was forced by poverty and illness and was tempted by villains to sell his own daughter into prostitution. When Saint Nicholas learned about this, he filled socks with money and secretly sent them to the old man's bedside. The next morning, the old man saw the socks and paid off all his debts. At first, he didn't know who sent the money, but later he realized that it was Saint Nicholas. From then on, everyone knew about this kind old man, and after his death, he was revered as the god who loves children.

There is another legend about Santa Claus. In the beginning, Europe had many protectors of sailors, travelers, and merchants. Every Christmas Eve, they would return from the north on sleds to celebrate Christmas. When they returned, they always brought many gifts to distribute to the children. This became an annual Christmas item, and at the same time, a Santa Claus was created, who was called Saint Claus.

After Santa Claus crossed the Atlantic Ocean, how did even his shape change? That was thanks to the American writer Washington Irving. In his book "A History of New York," Irving described Santa Claus as a burly, optimistic figure. Next, Moore described him in detail in his book "A Visit from St. Nicholas," saying that he was "fat and chubby, with a round belly, and laughing like a big ball shaking." Cartoonist Thomas Nast even formalized his image with books. As a result, this fat, white-haired, red-clothed old man officially became the Santa Claus recognized by everyone.

### Christmas Scenes in Paris

Paris, the world's capital of flowers, coupled with the pleasure-loving French, already has enough poetic and picturesque atmosphere in peacetime. On Christmas, it is even more full of pleasant scenes. Eating, drinking, and dancing are the only programs that decorate Christmas in the streets of Paris. The British love to spend Christmas at home, enjoying family fun. The French, however, are not used to staying at home, but instead go out to enjoy themselves with others. Therefore, the streets of Paris on Christmas are crowded with people, singing loudly, dancing gracefully, and the sound of songs and music harmonize.

There are no empty seats in the restaurants. There are special delicacies and fragrant wines for everyone to enjoy. In the cafes, the guests surrounding the Christmas tree are drinking and eating heartily, enjoying the night. On the streets, there are also many open-air shops, where the fragrant turkeys and brightly colored wines make passers-by drool.

### Manger

Jesus was born and slept in a manger, so the manger is related to Christmas.

In Catholic churches, every Christmas, there must be a fake mountain made of paper, with a cave in the mountain. In the cave, there is a manger with the baby Jesus lying flat. Next to it are the Virgin Mary, the shepherds who came to visit that night, and his flock of sheep. The mountain is decorated with a snow scene, as well as winter flowers and plants such as holly and oak teeth red. This manger is not only to commemorate Jesus, but also a kind of decoration with poetic and artistic meaning.

On Christmas Eve, monks and believers, holding torches in their hands, come in groups to surround the manger and hold Mass, singing Christmas carols. The priests wear solemn vestments and read the Bible. After the Mass is over, everyone takes some straw from the manger home as a souvenir.

It is said that in 335 AD, the Roman Emperor made a very luxurious manger. The materials used were the most noble and the arrangement was very beautiful. Unfortunately, this manger lacked historical research, and it is unknown how exquisite it was. What is now verifiable is the manger made by the Franciscan monks in 1223 AD after they visited Bethlehem in 克来焦, which is the first one that has been handed down in history. In the forest next to the 克来焦 monastery, a cave was built with earth blocks, and a manger was prepared, covered with straw, and the baby Jesus lay on it. There was also a cow and a donkey next to it, just like the scene at that time.

### Hollywood Christmas Eve with Dazzling Lights and Decorations

### The First Christmas Card

In 1844, Englishman Dobson designed a Christmas card. The Christmas card was well drawn. Dobson was still in school when he designed it, so he won the architecture award from the Royal Specialized School. What was drawn on the card? Because the original manuscript was never printed, it was lost.

Before Dobson, an Englishman named Cole also had a plan to print Christmas cards. That was in 1843. Cole asked Horsley to design it for him. Horsley worked very slowly, and it took two years to finish the Christmas card. It was not officially printed and sold until Christmas Eve in 1846, but it did not catch up with Dobson.

The Christmas card designed by Horsley was the first Christmas card. Only fifty copies were printed for the first time, and they were sold out. So they continued to print more, and a total of five hundred copies were sold that year. The price at that time was one shilling. The price of this Christmas card today is not a small amount either. Cole was originally a small civil servant. The Christmas card business aroused his interest, and from the second year onwards, he opened a bookstore and made selling Christmas cards his main business.

### After Temporary Suspension of Gold Conversion Deposits, Prices in the City Fluctuate Violently

Since yesterday, after the national banks suspended the exchange of deposits for gold and silver, the prices of various commodities in the city have shown violent fluctuations. The reporter inquired about this matter with the financial management authorities, who said that there were two reasons for this phenomenon. One was that after the temporary suspension of gold and silver exchange, there was panic among the general public, which led to mutual price increases. The second was that the money supply has been easing in recent days, and speculators have deliberately raised prices after the national banks were ordered to suspend the exchange of gold and silver. However, they believe that given the weak purchasing power of citizens and the low sales volume of manufacturers, price fluctuations can be curbed in a short period of time. Moreover, the national banks have goods under control, and they can still be supplied when necessary to tighten the money supply.

The foreign exchange transfer certificate rose sharply on the 24th. It opened at 63 yuan in the morning. Many exporters held on to their holdings and refused to sell, while importers scrambled to absorb them, resulting in a sharp rise. It rose section by section and closed at 68 yuan at noon, still difficult to buy, up more than 10% compared with the 23rd. The remittance exchange rate is still 70 yuan.

The money market in the city yesterday curbed the abuse of power slightly. The demand for single shares was felt, and the interbank lending rate was solid, generally doing daily lending at 15 yuan to 16 yuan, or as high as 20 yuan, and transactions were also made. The demand for cash chips has also increased, but there are no signs of briskness.

Yesterday, due to the turnaround in the situation and optimistic public sentiment, coupled with the stirring of idle funds, the prices of all kinds of commodities rose across the board. The long-silent buying spree of citizens has also turned from static to dynamic due to the rising prices in the market, and the number of transactions in stores has doubled. However, although the prices in some commodity markets are still stagnant, the prices in retail stores have been raised.

### Stimulated by Out-of-Circle Prices, Rice Flour, Grain and Oil Rose Sharply

The price of rice rose sharply due to rising prices in the producing areas and being stimulated by out-of-circle prices. It opened up in the morning and rose immediately, and the market was even more fierce in the afternoon. The Northern City 白粳 opened at 400 yuan, and 薄称 opened at 390 yuan. After opening, it was heard that the out-of-circle gauze was rising sharply, which immediately turned people's hearts firm. The market price rose sharply to 460 yuan at the close, up 100 yuan from the previous market, and the latter was up 105 yuan. The prices of other grades of rice in the area rose by about 100 yuan across the board. The market atmosphere was particularly strong, and 本街 absorbed fiercely. The 南市塲 opened at 白粳 410 yuan and closed at 440 yuan, and 薄稻 460 yuan, each up 80 yuan to 100 yuan. Other grades of rice were all turned firm by 80-90 yuan. Yesterday, 9,438 stones of goods arrived in the two markets, of which 5,293 stones and five斗 arrived in the 北市塲 and 4,144 stones and five斗 arrived in the 南市塲.

Flour

The market price rose sharply due to the fierce absorption in 本街. 兵船粉 was 190 yuan, up 45 yuan from the previous market. 老車粉 opened at 195 yuan and closed at 205 yuan, rising 52 yuan. The prices of other grades of miscellaneous brand flour also rose sharply by 40-50 yuan. 鈇皮 also rose, exceeding the 100-yuan mark. 福新大包 was 124 yuan, and 阜豐大包 was 125 yuan, each rising by 40 yuan.

Grains

Rose sharply across the board, and transactions were brisk. Soybeans rose by 60 yuan, corn also rose by 60 yuan, Hankou 乍豆 was 255 yuan, Huangdu corn was 240 yuan, red grain rose by 35 yuan, raw peanuts rose sharply by 70-80 yuan, and sesame opened strongly, with Jiujiang black sesame at 410 yuan.

Edible Oil

Due to the sharp rise in out-of-circle prices, there was a lot of picking up, and the reporting households held on. The market price rose sharply across the board. The opening price of 本廠 soybean oil was a high of 1,400 yuan. The price in the Central Market rose by another 100 yuan, and the price still returned to 1,400 yuan in the afternoon market, up 300 yuan from the previous market. The sales of 本廠 rapeseed oil were more active than soybean oil. The opening price was 1,300 yuan, and after opening, due to the strong absorption, the holding households repeatedly held on. The market price rose again to 1,450 yuan, up 280 yuan from the previous market. Qingdao 吉桶 raw peanuts were 1,500 yuan, also rising sharply by 450 yuan, forming an unprecedented surge.

### Ministry of Finance Reiterates Previous Order Prohibiting Indiscriminate Issuance of Promissory Notes

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the prohibition of silver houses from indiscriminately issuing promissory notes, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated: "Silver houses issuing promissory notes should deposit 100% of the balance of the promissory note subject on that day in the Central Bank or the check clearing house. In areas without a Central Bank and a check clearing house, they should also have 100% of the funds in the treasury for withdrawal. Those who violate the regulations will be severely punished in accordance with the provisions of the latter part of Article 9 of the Detailed Financial Business Control Measures." It is understood that while many silver houses in various places are complying with the order, there are also many who have been violating the regulations for a long time. The Ministry of Finance has specifically reiterated the previous order, and if silver houses in various places are found to be indiscriminately issuing promissory notes again in the future, they will be severely punished and will not be lenient.

### Silk Rises Sharply

Yesterday's silk market was crazy, with the Central Bank temporarily suspending the exchange of gold, the black market for finance jumping sharply, and public sentiment stimulated. The prices of gauze outside the industry rose, buying was strong, and prices were shouted upwards.

The opening price of 120 天橋 in the morning was 24,000 yuan, a high price. After the high price, there was still a lot of picking up, and the market rose to a new high, once reaching 25,000 yuan, and the trend was extremely firm. Later, rumors spread that the environment was unfavorable, and public sentiment was slightly softer. Retail investors stopped absorbing and turned to spitting out, and the market atmosphere was slightly calmer. It finally ended at 24,800 yuan, a sharp increase of 5,400 yuan. The rise of 東洋金三馬 was similar.

Yesterday's raw silk market was unexpectedly good. The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates continued to rise, and the temporary suspension of gold exchange had a profound stimulation. As a result, the selling atmosphere turned into a state of being in charge, and because the prices of man-made silk and silk fabric rose sharply, the asking prices soared. The opening price of D-grade 78-evenness white factory silk was 25,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. The opening price of superior-grade零担 was 24,500 yuan, also up 4,000 yuan. The prices of other 輯里干经 and ordinary零担 also rose by 1,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan.

The silk fabric market was affected by the sharp rise in the silk market, and public sentiment was also mostly lively. However, because the sales channels were narrowing day by day, the base was still soft after the price increase. The morning opening price of 美亞被面 was 15,800 yuan. With various favorable news, public sentiment was unanimously optimistic. Although the opening price was high, the absorption in the market was still strong. The market price rose higher and higher until it closed at 16,500 yuan, up 3,500 yuan. The prices of the remaining fabrics all rose by more than 20%.

### Sugar Rises Sharply

Yesterday, the sugar market rose across the board due to the simultaneous rise in out-of-circle prices and the stimulation of public sentiment. The bulls took the opportunity to raise prices, agitating the actual situation, and the prices of various grades rose across the board.

The price of four or five carloads of white refined sugar after the opening was set, and the prices repeatedly reached new highs, reaching a maximum of 850 yuan. After the high price, floating scattered gains were realized, and the market saw a slight decline, closing at 830 yuan, up 190 yuan. The price of coarse sand closed at 800 yuan, also up 205 yuan. The prices of the remaining grades all rose by more than 30%.

### Tea Market Shows Excellence

Yesterday, the tea market trend showed a show of excellence, and the market continued to increase. The reason was that the prices of various commodities outside the market rose sharply, and the funds of the industry were extremely loose. Therefore, the cargo owners were all holding on to their holdings and were reluctant to let go easily. The export boxed tea, with the foreign exchange certificate matching the export price, had a strong buying atmosphere, and especially the green teas such as 针眉 and 秀眉 were in a hurry to catch the ship schedule, and the demand was even stronger, which led to a sudden imbalance in the supply and demand in the market, and it was seen to be prosperous. As for the domestic sales of fancy teas, they were also raided and purchased by 本街 and other places, and the market therefore rose sharply.

### Tung Oil Advances to New Highs

After the holding households raised the price of tung oil, the market was firm at the beginning of the morning. After a while, the rising wind was still surging and unstoppable, creating an unprecedented peak. The reason was that the 足度 white oil, which was mainly for export, was rising rapidly in the foreign exchange transfer certificate, and there was also an export ship schedule on the 28th of this month. Therefore, foreign firms were absorbing it, and public sentiment became more and more expensive. The market rose rapidly and straight up. As for 青油, the paint gangs in 本街 also dragged and advanced, and the situation was firm. However, the buying atmosphere of Hongjiang tung oil was still narrow, and the market followed suit.

### Hearts Unusually Elated, Cotton Yarn Prices Surge, Cloth Profiting from Strong Buying Sentiment

Yesterday morning, stimulated by the suspension of gold deposit exchange, people's hearts were even more elated, and the buying sentiment became stronger. Local customers reached out very frequently, and short covering was frantic, causing market prices to soar.

42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 270,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of 6,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other brands such as Baoguang and Jincheng also surged by about 6,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 5,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon rose by 4,500 yuan, reaching a new price of 22,500 yuan.

20-count Double Horse opened at 19,300 yuan in the morning, reaching a high of 21,000 yuan at one point, and closed at 20,200 yuan at noon, a rise of 3,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were also raised to 19,100 yuan. 20-count Double Horse closed at 17,900 yuan, up 3,000 yuan from the previous day. Other brands such as Golden Rooster and Heavenly Maiden also surged rapidly towards new highs. All grades of coarse yarn below 16-count rose by 20% to 30%.

### Coordinating with Total War, Five Major Themes of Sichuan Politics, Formulating Core Work

— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan

[Our Newspaper Chengdu Eighteenth Dispatch] With the flames of war burning in the Southeast, Sichuan, once again acting as "China's Kamchatka," has put on military attire amidst stability. In the freezing cold of winter, a wartime scene can be seen everywhere. The Seventh Conference of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly is being held at this time to unite the government and the public and jointly plan for the security of Sichuan. Wang Lingji, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, gave a comprehensive report to the conference on the government's administration since August and the extraordinary measures to cope with the urgent situation in the future. From this, we can see the overall dynamics of Sichuan politics.

Land Tax Collection, Rushing Military Grain

The first priority of Sichuan's current political affairs is land and grain. The army relies on grain, and the people rely on food. The quota for collection and borrowing has always been the top priority. This year, the total amount of collection and borrowing allocated by the Executive Yuan is 9 million shi, half for collection and half for borrowing, plus 2.7 million shi for public grain and 3.2 million shi for grain storage. The last Provincial Assembly reduced the borrowing quota to 4.05 million shi, plus 450,000 shi for cultural and educational subsidies. After consultations between the provincial government and the central government via letters and telegrams, and after the decision of the National Grain Conference, the collection quota was maintained, and the borrowing quota was reduced to 6.17 million shi. The collection began in October and will be completed by the end of the year. Because Sichuan as a whole has had a bumper harvest this year, and the grain farmers are fearful of the national crisis, they have enthusiastically paid taxes out of patriotic fervor. So far, the general situation in eastern and southern Sichuan is good, with over 70% of the quota already collected. The average collection in northwestern Sichuan is also above 50%. In addition, military grain is being transported eastward and Sichuan grain is being supplied to Beijing and Shanghai, with Chongqing and Wanxian as the focus of concentration and transportation. A total of more than 400,000 large packages have been concentrated from October to December for emergency transportation, with more than half already shipped out. Efforts will be made to ship all of them by the end of the year.

Promoting Conscription, Launching Organization and Training

Another central item of Sichuan's political affairs is conscription. The quota for the last fiscal year was already fully recruited. The quota for the next fiscal year is more than 71,500 people (including more than 1,300 in Chongqing City). Conscription began in September, and more than 45,000 people have been recruited so far. Recently, an emergency telegram was received from the central government to supplement the troops fighting in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, requesting the conscription of more than 24,000 people from the 38th year, to be completed by January. At the same time, intellectual youths are being widely mobilized to join the army. The sons of Sichuan, with a shared hatred of the enemy and inspired by the suppression of the rebellion, are enthusiastically joining the army. Therefore, the promotion of conscription in Sichuan has been very effective in principle, and there should be no problem in meeting the quota. In addition, in coordination with conscription, the organization and training of the people is being carried out. According to the "Sichuan Provincial People's Self-Defense Organization and Training Plan," it began to be implemented in October. People's Self-Defense Brigades have been established in all counties and cities, police squadrons have been changed to regular Self-Defense Squadrons, and security squadrons have been changed to security platoons. So far, reorganization has been completed in 132 counties and cities. Cadres for organization and training have been recruited from discharged and retired military officers, and military officers selected from various counties and guarantees have been commissioned. Provincial training classes for Self-Defense Organization and Training Cadres and county and city classes have been held separately, and training for basic Self-Defense Teams throughout Sichuan has been launched. It is expected that in three months, 2 million well-trained militiamen can be formed to defend the country with weapons.

Emergency Deployment, Four Major Steps

The fourth key topic is the emergency deployment of defense to achieve the goal of securing Sichuan and defending the country, which is divided into four major steps: (1) Comprehensive suppression of internal bandits. In conjunction with the Chongqing-Sui Garrison Command, the Southwest Winter Defense Plan is being implemented, launching four phases of general suppression to completely eliminate large and small bandit gangs throughout Sichuan. Significant progress has been made in stages. The bandit rebellion in Huaying Mountain, a major concern, has also entered the stage of pacification and aftermath. (2) Allocation of security regiments. This year, ten security regiments have been added. The Fourth Security Regiment of northern Sichuan is stationed in the Guangyuan area, the Seventh Security Regiment of southeastern Sichuan is stationed in Wanyuan, the Sixth Security Regiment is stationed in Dazhou and Xuanhan, and the Second Security Regiment is guarding the area around Huaying Mountain. The remaining regiments are defending Chengdu and the western Sichuan area. (3) Rushing to repair national defense highways. Laborers are mobilized day and night to rush to build the Dazhou-Guangyuan and Chengdu-Bazhong highways. Emergency construction is underway in sections of the Dazhou-Guangyuan highway, and sections in Dazhou, Pingchang, Nanjiang, and Guangyuan have been completed successively. Laborers from counties along the road are working together to rush to repair the entire road. The emergency repair projects in Xindu, Jintang, Yilong, Bazhong, and Santai sections of the Chengdu-Bazhong road are progressing perfectly day and night. (4) Setting up a telecommunications network. Recently, the following defense telecommunications networks have been rushed to set up: Dazhou to Tongjiang line, Mianyang (misspelled as Pian) to Guangyuan line, Bazhong to Yilong line, Pingchang to Bazhong line, and Chengdu to Yuezhong special line. The telecommunications network throughout Sichuan is now relatively complete.

Core Work, Five Major Political Affairs

As for the future, in order to coordinate with the overall war and promote wartime politics, the provincial government's policy plan for the next year is based on the principles of increasing military strength, suppressing rebellion, reforming politics, stabilizing society, increasing production, and stabilizing the economy. Twelve core tasks have been formulated, including: (1) Strictly organizing Baojia (households), (2) Intensifying self-defense organization and training, (3) Expanding security forces, (4) Enriching military grain and regulating civilian food, (5) Improving conscription on time and in full amount, (6) Reorganizing provincial and county finances, (7) Enriching basic education, (8) Sheltering refugee students and refugees, (9) Completing national defense highways, (10) Increasing grain production, (11) Thoroughly suppressing internal bandits, (12) Supporting owner-farmers and implementing land allocation for soldiers. These twelve core tasks are summarized into five major political affairs: organization and training, grain collection, conscription, suppression of internal bandits, and resettlement of refugees. This year, Sichuan's principle of governance is to seek construction in stability. Next year's policy direction is to mobilize and complete the suppression of rebellion. This is a major transformation of Sichuan from peacetime to wartime. From securing Sichuan to building the nation, the people of Sichuan deeply understand the great historical mission of the present.

### Thunderstorms in Suzhou, Nantong and Other Places

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Twenty-Fourth Dispatch] The weather is abnormal. The north wind here is biting, the temperature is falling, and there is a dense drizzle all day long. Suddenly, in the afternoon, there was a sudden downpour with thunder. It only stopped in the evening.

[Our Newspaper Nantong Twenty-Fourth Dispatch] It has been raining for days, and today it turned cold again. At 3:50 PM, there was a sudden burst of thunder and a brief shower. [Our Newspaper Changsha Twenty-Fourth Dispatch] It suddenly turned cold here today, and the temperature dropped to minus two degrees Celsius. At about 2:00 AM last night, there was thunder and lightning, and heavy rain poured down, just like a summer rainstorm.

### Zhenjiang All Circles Decide to Expand Troop Comfort Movement on New Year's Day

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Twenty-Fourth Dispatch] All circles in the provincial capital have decided to expand troop comfort activities on New Year's Day. In addition to organizing comfort groups to bring supplies to visit wounded and sick officers and soldiers, they will also mobilize all theaters to provide free admission to National Army veterans and honorary soldiers on New Year's Day.

### Teacher Detained for Refusing to Pay Overdue Taxes, Hu Jiansong Beaten and Injured

[Our Newspaper Wuxi Twenty-Third Dispatch] Officials from the county land and grain office and faculty members of the Jiangsu Wuxi Normal School have caused a great uproar over grain matters. It is reported that Hu Jiansong, a collector from the land and grain office, went to the Jiangsu Provincial Wuxi Normal School at about 7:00 PM last night to collect overdue taxes, which led to a dispute with the school authorities. He took Wang Pu'an, a teacher from the school, to the county. The teachers of the Jiangsu Provincial Wuxi Normal School launched a petition and stormed into the county government, beating Hu Jiansong and injuring him. Public servants then formed a support association and went on strike to show their support. However, according to Principal Shi, the alleged beating incident by the county is purely an insult. Therefore, how to deal with this case will depend on Director Zhou's return to the county before a decision can be made.

### Miniature News

Changshu

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Xu Genjin, a resident of Yangjian Town, was suddenly shot and killed by thugs on the night of the 23rd. Xu's concubine was also injured in the head. The murderers are on the run. The authorities are currently searching for them.

Wuxi

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Qian Sunqing and others from the business community, recently, due to the tense situation, in order to strengthen local self-defense, convened a symposium of local people from all walks of life on the 24th, decided to organize a business self-defense force, and promoted Zhu Wenyuan, Shen Jizhi, Shi Qinglin and others to prepare, and established a joint association of people's public and private organizations to strengthen local contacts.

Suzhou

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The local winter relief association yesterday hosted reporters. General Secretary Fan Gongren reported: the fundraising target is 10,000 pieces of winter clothing, 320 shi of rice, and daily congee distribution for 2,000 people. Fundraising and a "one yuan movement" are now being launched, and all circles are requested to donate generously.

### Supervisory Committee's Censure Letter to Yangtze Company (Continued from Page Four)

1. The relevant government agencies that should be censured in this case: (1) It has been found that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, before the occurrence of this case, had already received a confidential report from Zhao Hongkuan, a member of the Economic Police Team, to the Economic Police Brigade. The Brigade Commander Cheng Yikuan should be regarded as having initiated a denunciation, and should have sent personnel to investigate. However, the Brigade Commander ignored it (no processing documents were found in the files). It was not until September 19 that the member reported in writing again, and it was only delayed until the 23rd that the reply was "OK." He also did not issue an attendance certificate as required to facilitate the investigation duties of the members. Even when the members requested to issue it on the 24th, he ignored it. What was his intention? It is indeed worthy of speculation. It was also found that on September 29, the company was discovered by the Lujiawan Branch Bureau to have secretly transported goods by large trucks. In the previous ten days, it is doubtful whether there were any personnel in charge who heard the news and concealed materials. Brigade Commander Cheng Yikuan of the Economic Police Team, at a time when economic control was in full swing, repeatedly delayed after members of his team denounced large-scale hoarding. It is not certain whether he deliberately facilitated the Yangtze Construction Company's concealment of criminal suspicion, but his dereliction of duty is clearly obvious.

Police Chief Yu Shuping also failed to take active action in handling this case. For example, investigating ledgers and documents is a necessary procedure for the progress of this case, but the Bureau never took the initiative to conduct a thorough check. Later, Wei Yueguang supervised the investigation, and the company unreasonably refused. The Bureau also did not make effective corrections based on its authority, which was obviously different from the attitude towards ordinary companies. After checking the goods, the so-called deposited goods were said to be shared with the Dalian Bay warehouse by the Shishi Xinbao and Dalu Bao newspapers, and the Lichang Company denied that Yangtze Construction Company imported the cars, etc. However, the relevant parties were not provided with documents or checked thoroughly, which was not as strict as in general cases. The Economic Management Office's telegram on October 13 instructed the Bureau to handle the case according to law, but no measures were taken by the Bureau. Brigade Commander Cheng Yikuan repeatedly delayed the case and failed to investigate and correct it. In summary, Bureau Chief Yu Shuping was also afraid of power and neglected his duties.

2. Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government did not ask about this case at first. Only after Wei Yueguang personally urged him with a letter did he begin to handle it, but there were still many improprieties. For example, regarding whether the import of goods was legal and whether there was any concealment, he only relied on the company's presented goods storage receipts and customs tax bills to check, and did not investigate ledgers and original documents as required. How could he investigate whether there was any concealment of goods and whether the import of goods was falsely labeled? After Xue Xieshen Du Lie reviewed the incomplete documents, he discovered that the company had imported more than ten kinds of goods that were prohibited from import or temporarily not allowed to be imported by falsely using accounting forms to evade taxes. Lichang Company also stored cars of Yangtze Construction Company, and there were imports without permits and applications for remittances. At that time, the review work presided over by the municipal government was hasty, perfunctory, and unrealistic. For example, the police bureau reported that the deposited items, shared warehouses, and Lichang Company denied any commercial relationship with Yangtze Construction Company, but it did not provide evidence and conduct thorough checks, nor did it correct and re-investigate. Furthermore, if the company violated industrial and commercial management laws and the Shanghai Municipal Warehouse Inspection Points, regarding joining trade associations and reporting the quantity of goods, import date, and warehouse location to the relevant trade associations each month and reporting to the Social Bureau, the main officials should have investigated early on, but the municipal government and its subordinate agencies did not impose any penalties. Furthermore, among the goods hoarded by Yangtze Construction Company, in addition to replying that the industrial raw materials and daily necessities would be supplied to the market at the price limit stipulated by the Economic Control Supervisor's Office on November 6, the remaining goods, such as Western medicines, most of which were daily necessities, had been stored for more than a year, and the number reached more than 2,000 boxes. In particular, there were also quite a few prohibited imports and unauthorized imports of glass products (colloidal), cosmetics, woolen products, and foreign wines. The municipal government, as the proper competent agency for this case, did not mention a word in the reply, which is incomprehensible, at a time when the whole country was paying attention to the outcome of the case. Mayor Wu Guozhen, even if he was not deliberately protecting, was also neglecting his duties. (To be continued)
