### Commercial Banks and Firms to Submit Lists; Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange to be Transferred by Deadline; Xu Baiyuan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to督促辦理

[Our Newspaper] Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, was dispatched to Shanghai to, together with the Central Bank,督促辦理 the transfer of foreign exchange assets from various commercial banks and firms to the Central Bank. Mr. Xu arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and immediately went to the Central Bank to discuss the matter with Governor Yu Hongjun, Deputy Governor Liu Gongyun, and Director of the Gold and Foreign Exchange Control Bureau Lin Chongyong. They invited the heads of various commercial banks to talks in the morning and afternoon. Those invited included Li Fusun of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Xu Jilong of Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Dai Mingli of Shanghai United Bank, Qian Xinzhizhi of Zhongnan Bank, Xu Guomao of Jincheng Bank, Hu Huichun of China Industrial Bank, Yang Xizhi of China National Products Bank, and the heads of Juxingcheng Bank and Guangdong Bank, among ten banks. Mr. Xu solemnly informed them that they must submit detailed accounts to the government before the deadline, listing all foreign exchange, foreign currency, and foreign deposits, stocks, government bonds, gold, and silver held by their respective banks. Whether or not to transfer all of these assets in the future will be considered separately by the government. In addition, they discussed the transfer methods in detail. It is heard that the amount of foreign exchange to be transferred and the transfer methods for each bank and firm will be finalized by this afternoon at the latest.

[United Credit Reporting Agency] Regarding the transfer of foreign exchange from commercial banks and firms to the national bank, Li Ming, Chairman of the Bankers Association, stated that everything will be handled in accordance with government laws and regulations. After discussions with Governor Yu and Vice Minister Xu, it was decided to transfer the assets in batches, with the first batch to be delivered to the Central Bank on the 8th. Reports stated that commercial banks had collected ten million US dollars to sell to the Central Bank to resolve the matter. Mr. Li offered some explanation, stating that there had been a decision for small banks to sell to the Central Bank as a source of funds for increasing capital, which was separate from the transfer. The previous plan will now be abandoned in accordance with government laws and regulations. As for the issue of increasing bank capital, the banks and firms do not feel it is difficult because the amount of capital increase has been reduced by half from the original amount, so the amount to be increased is not large.

[Central News Agency, This City] Li Fusun, Chairman of the Bankers and Trade Association, invited the directors to a discussion yesterday morning to review the matter of complying with the order to transfer foreign exchange assets. It was decided to have the association issue a document to notify all members to comply with the order. The method is for each bank and firm to create a list of their original foreign exchange assets based on their accounts, submit the list to the association, and then have the association submit it to the national bank to complete the registration procedures.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the issue of commercial banks and firms depositing foreign exchange assets and gold and silver with the Central Bank, sources from relevant financial circles here revealed that if the persons in charge of various banks and firms violate these laws and regulations, their business operations may be subject to suspension.

The financial authorities are paying close attention to this and will soon announce and implement strict measures.

### Xu Baiyuan Speaks; Government Guides Idle Capital; Considers Issuing Short-Term Treasury Bills and Gold Yuan Bonds; National Foreign Exchange Holdings to be Reported Soon

[Our Newspaper] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan met with reporters at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon and answered various questions. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The government's current plan to reform the currency system is comprehensive in nature, but for the time being, it will first focus on several key points, such as handling national foreign exchange declarations and prohibiting price increases for public utilities. The hope is to focus on key points and gradually promote the overall plan. The government is very serious about the implementation of this plan. (2) The transfer of foreign exchange from banks and firms is the first step in handling the national foreign exchange declaration.

(3) Domestic remittances are not currently strictly restricted, but the purpose of the remittances should be investigated. (4) The government will promote national savings measures to balance revenue and expenditure. Recently, the number of official cars assigned to the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan has been reduced by half as originally planned, which is one proof of the government taking the lead in advocating this. It is hoped that all sectors of society will follow suit. (5) The government will consider issuing short-term treasury bills and gold yuan bonds as a way to guide idle capital. The denomination and interest rate of these bonds are still being revised, and the issuance regulations are awaiting approval by the Legislative Yuan. (6) The government's reorganization of legal tender bonds will cost approximately 12 million gold yuan. (7) The issuance methods for the public sale of shares in state-owned enterprises will be drafted by the various state-owned enterprises. The government will make a public announcement of the entire plan within days. (8) There is no definite news about when the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Tianjin will reopen.

However, the matter is currently under investigation by all relevant parties, and he will not express more opinions.

### Government Comprehensively Reorganizes Old Debts; Simultaneously Considers the Burden on the National Treasury and the Interests of Bondholders; Chen Bingzhang Talks About the Two Meanings of Reorganizing Old Debts

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In accordance with the provisions of the emergency decree on finance and economy promulgated by the President, the Ministry of Finance had proposed and the Executive Yuan's Provisional Political Affairs Meeting approved the measures for handling legal tender bonds and foreign currency bonds and the principles for issuing reorganization bonds in the 37th year. According to Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance: The significance of the government's approval of the reorganization of old debts this time can be divided into the following two points: (1) Regarding foreign currency bonds, according to the short-term treasury bills in the 36th year and the foreign currency government bonds in the 27th, 29th, and 31st years, the repayment of principal and interest due was originally converted into legal tender according to the official foreign exchange rate of the Central Bank (12,000 yuan of legal tender per US dollar). After the revision of the foreign exchange management measures in August last year, in order to protect the interests of bondholders, the government changed the conversion to legal tender according to the market price of the designated bank's US dollar. After the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement certificate system in June this year, the Bankers Association in Beijing and Shanghai presented to the Ministry, suggesting that the foreign currency bonds be recovered in advance at one time according to the balance sheet settlement rate (474,000 yuan of legal tender per US dollar). Later, the Supervisory Committee of the 36-year short-term treasury bills and US dollar government bond fund and the National Bankers Association also sent letters suggesting that the principal and interest be repaid on time according to the balance sheet settlement rate plus the market price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate (approximately 4.5 million yuan at the time). The government could have adopted and implemented the above two suggestions. Now, in order to consider the bondholders' desire to maintain the currency value, the government has decided that the face value of foreign currency bonds will be calculated according to the legal exchange rate, with each US dollar converted into 4 gold yuan, which is 12 million legal tender, which is several times better than the hopes suggested by all parties, which proves the government's efforts to maintain credit. At the same time, in order to alleviate the current burden on the national treasury, it was decided to exchange the four foreign currency bonds into gold yuan government bonds according to the legal exchange rate. Although the repayment period of the new bonds is slightly longer than the remaining repayment period of the old bonds, the extension is only about two and a half to six years, and the new bonds are convenient for payment and can maintain the exchange rate against the US dollar. This handling method was originally drafted in accordance with the President's emergency decree, and it can be said that both the interests of bondholders and the burden on the national treasury are taken into consideration, which is beneficial to both parties. (2) Regarding legal tender bonds, the principal and interest of legal tender bonds have always been repaid at a one-to-one ratio according to the face value of the legal tender, in accordance with the regulations, and this was also done in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War. This is because government bonds are different from ordinary loans. The funds raised by the government's sale of bonds are used for national expenditures at any time, unlike banks and enterprises that can use the deposits they absorb for profit-making operations. Moreover, bond tickets can be freely transferred and circulated, and the current holders may not all be the original subscribers. Therefore, since the复员, the courts in various places have made different judgments on the cases of banks' pre-war deposits and private loans being repaid at double the amount, but government bonds have been specially excluded and are not subject to double repayment. Now, with the currency reform, in order to understand the enthusiasm of the ticket holders for purchasing bonds to help the country in the past, the government does not hesitate to increase the burden on the national treasury and resolutely decides to give them graded multiple repayments to show preferential treatment. Moreover, the calculation of the remaining period of various legal tender bonds according to their original repayment period shows that the shortest period is still several years and the longest is more than 33 years. Now, the government will repay them all in advance at one time regardless of the length of the remaining repayment period. The multiple of graded repayment ranges from a maximum of 27,000 times to a minimum of 1,000 times. For example, taking the bonds issued before the war as an example, the price is higher than the暗市 price of the Shanghai unified government bonds on August 19 this year. Assuming that it is calculated according to the appendix of the pre-war deposit and loan settlement regulations of the banking industry, the number of principal and interest that should be repaid per yuan is about eight times more than the number of multiple repayments of various government bonds. The government has done its best to make this decision in the face of extreme financial difficulties.

Chen finally said that in European and American countries, whenever there is a foreign war or a major change in the fire, the value of currency has always depreciated, but it is rare to see the fact that government bonds are repaid at double the amount, and it is rare to hear that the people have asked for double repayment. After the First European War, the French franc depreciated significantly, and the people, thinking of the government's financial difficulties, concentrated the bonds they held in the square and burned them in public to show their sincerity in helping the country. Their patriotism is very touching. My country has been fighting for more than eight years, and the government has issued government bonds before and after the Anti-Japanese War, which were enthusiastically subscribed by patriotic people in various places to help the country overcome difficulties. Overseas Chinese compatriots have remitted their savings from their daily节衣缩食 to purchase them from afar, and their spirit of急公好义 and caring for their motherland is especially worthy of praise for the virtues of our nation. However, the war has been prolonged, and the destruction is significant. The losses of life and property of the people across the country are incalculable. It is also an inevitable fact of the war that some government bondholders have suffered losses due to currency depreciation. Now, the government is planning and clearly reorganizing the old debts, and at the beginning of the currency reform, when the finance is still difficult, the legal tender bonds are graded and revalued, and they are repaid in advance. For foreign currency bonds, the exchange rate is raised, and new bonds are allocated. The government also has unified repayment procedures and simplifies the convenience of debt administration, which is truly a multi-purpose measure. It is deeply believed that all old debt holders will be able to understand the government's intention to maintain, and will uphold the past patriotic enthusiasm and support this measure in order to promote the country's finances to quickly move towards a stable path.

### Mourning the National Tragedy of Czechoslovakia

Dr. Edvard Beneš, the founding father of Czechoslovakia, passed away on the 3rd of this month. Today, Czechoslovakia is holding a state funeral for Dr. Beneš. Beneš's death has shocked every corner of the world. Not only are the people of Prague weeping in sorrow, but people all over the world are mourning and praising the death of this giant who struggled arduously throughout his life for his country's freedom, democracy, and peace. Beneš's death is indeed not only a loss for Czechoslovakia, but also a great loss for the entire world. Since the Czechoslovak coup in February and the suicide of Foreign Minister Masaryk, the difficulties faced by Beneš have been of concern to democratic countries around the world. This March, there were rumors that Beneš had committed suicide out of grief and indignation, and later there were rumors that he was weak and ill. It was not until June 7, when Beneš resigned from the presidency, that we knew he was still alive and living in seclusion in the suburbs of Prague, engaged in writing his memoirs of the war. Unexpectedly, only three months later, Dr. Beneš passed away!

Today, on this national day of mourning in Czechoslovakia, the grief of the people throughout the country is truly "as if they had lost their own parents." The masses who automatically went to pay their respects to Beneš's remains can be said to have emptied the streets. This is certainly the "posthumous honor" that Beneš deserved, but the true intentions of the Czech people can also be seen from the unprecedented grandeur of Beneš's state funeral.

Beneš's life can be said to have been entirely for the freedom, democracy, and peace of his country. Although Beneš, like others, went from primary school to secondary school, and from secondary school to university, specializing in philosophy, he was inspired by his teacher Masaryk (the founding father of Czechoslovakia, i.e., the first president) at the University of Prague, and later devoted himself to revolution. Although Beneš also studied in Paris and London, his purpose was to study the Austro-Czech problem. As soon as he completed his studies, he returned to Prague to teach at his alma mater and, together with Masaryk, organized the "Realist Party." The teacher and student cooperated to promote the theory of Czech independence. Therefore, Dr. Beneš was a promising young man who was loyal to his country from an early age.

During Masaryk's leadership in Czechoslovakia's independence, Beneš was always responsible for diplomatic work. When the "Czech National Council" was established in Paris in 1915, Beneš served as the secretary-general of the council, planning the grand strategy for Czech independence and organizing international intelligence and propaganda agencies. His first successful attempt was to obtain recognition of the "National Council" by the Allied Powers as the provisional government of Czechoslovakia. At the end of October 1918, Masaryk returned to Prague and declared independence to the outside world. Masaryk became the first president, and Beneš became the foreign minister, remaining in Paris to attend the Versailles Peace Conference. He used his diplomatic skills to win back many rights for his country, so that the world would no longer believe the outdated idea that "weak countries have no diplomacy." However, when President Masaryk resigned in 1935 and Beneš succeeded him as the second president, not only was Czechoslovakia in trouble, constantly in a state of turmoil, but Beneš's fate was also fraught with difficulties. He encountered the rise of Nazi Germany's aggressive forces, which not only harbored ambitions for Austria and Poland, but also coveted Czechoslovakia for a long time. Relying on his foresight and flexible diplomatic skills, Beneš wanted to unite Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly resist the outward expansion of German forces. However, figures like French Prime Minister Daladier and British Prime Minister Chamberlain were short-sighted and adopted a policy of appeasement towards Hitler, sacrificing the interests of friendly countries, which led to the Munich Conference scandal, which returned the newly emerging Czechoslovakia to fragmentation. Even Dr. Beneš, who loved his country, could not bear the pressure from Germany and fled to Britain and the United States. The pain in Beneš's heart cannot be described by pen and ink, not even a fraction of it.

However, Beneš was still able to endure what others could not endure, and remained optimistic about the future of Czechoslovakia. He predicted that World War II would break out sooner or later, and actively prepared for it. In September 1939, the war broke out as expected. Beneš immediately went from the United States to Britain and organized a "government in exile" in London to continue the Czech independence movement. He believed that the restoration of Czechoslovakia must rely on the assistance of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and that none could be missing. Therefore, during the war, he spared no effort to travel across the ocean, first visiting the United States and then traveling to Moscow to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union. In 1945, the Nazis surrendered. Beneš triumphantly returned to Prague on the 16th, and all his long-cherished wishes were fulfilled. We cannot but praise Beneš's glorious achievements. It is a pity that Beneš's good times did not last long. The complex and volatile situation in Europe after the war became increasingly intense, making Czechoslovakia a microcosm of the world. Although Beneš only knew how to work for a free, democratic, and peaceful Czechoslovakia, and tried every means to mediate conflicts between various political parties in order to achieve domestic peace and democracy, the coup in February this year completely destroyed Beneš's efforts. Not only did the Czechoslovak Communist Party implement a one-party dictatorship, but Beneš was also politically isolated and lost his footing. Therefore, he retired into seclusion and died in depression.

Recently, we saw Beneš's "War Memoirs" published in the National Weekly published in the United States, which further increased our admiration and respect for him. He was not only a Czech politician, diplomat, and revolutionary, but also an outstanding international statesman. He believed in democracy, sought freedom, longed for peace, and yearned for an ideal world. He followed a middle path domestically and was like a third party internationally. He advocated that the East and the West should work together to create world peace. However, things did not go as he wished, and none of his ideals were realized, and none of his efforts were successful. Now, Beneš is sleeping in the ground, and even this bridge connecting the East and the West has been broken! The great beam is broken, and the wise man withers. This is not only a misfortune for Czechoslovakia, but a misfortune for the entire world!

### People's Organizations in Beiping Telegraph the Central Government, Requesting That the "7-5 Incident" Be Handled According to Law

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] Since the publication of the investigation report and impeachment by Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui regarding the "7-5 Incident," it has been rumored that Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi took responsibility and telegraphed requesting punishment. People's organizations in Beiping believe that the military, police, and gendarmerie responsible for security in the "7-5 Incident" were carrying out their duties according to law and should not be punished for dereliction of duty. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed the President, the heads of the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan, and the Minister of National Defense, requesting that the case be handled according to law to uphold justice. The telegram states: "Northeast students, unable to bear the oppression of the traitorous bandits, made their way into the interior to continue their studies. Due to the large number of students arriving temporarily, the responsible authorities failed to make timely arrangements, resulting in displacement. The Municipal Council was concerned and passed a resolution recommending relief, which was misunderstood by the students, leading to the 7-5 Incident. All aftermath matters and responsibilities for the incident are being handled by specialists appointed by Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi to assess the situation. It is heard that Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui came to Beiping to investigate and recently issued a report and impeachment, holding the security authorities responsible for dereliction of duty. Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, with a humble attitude, took responsibility and requested punishment, which surprised all citizens. The investigation report of the two Committee members, Gu and Hu, generally corresponds to the facts and circumstances of the day, but the proposed responsibility for the incident seems to lack careful consideration. The actual situation and legal viewpoints are presented below for your consideration and adoption: (1) At the time of the 7-5 Incident, bad elements mixed in and took the opportunity to instigate. The first shot was fired from the student side, which is a fact described in the investigation report. Therefore, the responsibility for the incident should be borne by the bad elements who took the opportunity to instigate, which should not be difficult to point out correctly. (2) The tragedy occurred after martial law was declared, which was not noted in the report. The students, numbering four to five thousand, took advantage of the crowd to destroy the Municipal Council and assault the police and gendarmerie officers maintaining order. After destroying the Municipal Council, they went to the East 交民巷 (Embassy District), where foreign consulates were located, and surrounded the residence of Speaker Xu. In order to prevent the traitorous bandits from taking advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble in the special environment of the East 交民巷, the security authorities, based on the instructions of the highest military officer, declared temporary martial law and dispatched troops to be on alert. According to martial law regulations, after martial law is declared, the military and police are required to carry guns to deal with emergency situations in order to protect the safety of 1.8 million citizens and the area related to the views of both Chinese and foreigners in the East 交民巷, which is a matter of course. Even if an accident occurs due to the prevention of riots, there is no legal responsibility, which is also common practice in various countries. (3) The 208th Division is the designated unit responsible for city defense. After martial law was declared, there were no other armed forces available for deployment except for the deployment of this division. The report also states that field troops should not be deployed to be responsible for internal city guards, which seems to be an insufficient observation of the actual situation. (4) This city has numerous schools and has always been a base for lurking traitorous bandits to create incidents. Evidence shows that at the time of the 7-5 Incident, non-Northeast students raised flags to incite and openly shout slogans. On July 9th, they openly violated the martial law order and gathered to parade and petition, shouting slogans such as 'Shoot Fu Zuoyi,' which clearly indicates that traitorous bandits were manipulating and directing them from behind the scenes. In summary, the original report and impeachment are very clear in identifying the facts, but the assignment of responsibility is inappropriate, and the legal viewpoints do not seem to have been fully considered. All people should be equal before the law, and students should not be given preferential treatment. Officials should not be held accountable for taking unavoidable measures due to their responsibilities, especially in student incidents. Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi defends North China. Amidst military affairs, he personally supervises and arranges for Northeast students in many ways, and he has no responsibility to bear. The security authorities have also made the greatest tolerance and effort in the 7-5 Incident, and should not be punished for dereliction of duty. In order to prevent the dignity of the law from being distorted due to the environment, and to prevent the recurrence of chaos in Beiping due to the military and police not daring to fully exercise their powers, we hereby jointly telegraph our sincere request for consideration of the situation and handling of the case according to law, in order to appease public anger and curb the sprouts of chaos. The telegram is urgent and awaits your orders." Jointly submitted by the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Labor Union, Farmers' Association, Women's Association, Education Association, Lawyers Association, and Journalists Association.

### Qingdao China Textile Company's Yarn and Cloth Prices; Yarn and Cloth Merchants Attempt to Lower Prices

China Textile Company Says It Can Directly Distribute to Citizens

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 7th] The issue of the sales price of yarn and cloth by the Qingdao Branch of the China Textile Company has become one of the topics of discussion among citizens in recent weeks. The list price of the China Textile Company's Qingdao Branch has been clinging to the frozen price of August 19th, making it unprofitable for cloth merchants under the price limit situation. Yarn and cloth merchants have attempted to put pressure on the China Textile Company through the authorities. The China Textile Company responded that the legitimate yarn and cloth demand in Qingdao is less than one-tenth of the company's output. Currently, the merchants' demands are to seek speculation and hoarding. In recent weeks, almost all Qingdao newspapers have been debating whether the sales price should be reduced. The municipal authorities, seeing that various prices have fluctuated due to the black market price of yarn and cloth, intend to order the China Textile Company to lower its list price.

### Japanese Goods Dumped in Siam, Many Types, Low Prices

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, July 7th] Ministry of Industry and Commerce News: Under the external assistance of Japanese industry, the resumption of export trade to achieve self-sufficiency has taken less than a year.

The types of Japanese goods imported into Siam now include cloth, carpets, glass and glassware, porcelain, electrical appliances and electrical materials, ironware, various toys, aluminum products, canvas shoes, automobile and bicycle tires, and various sewing machines. The quantities are not small. The number of carpets alone has exceeded one million. The styles and patterns of all goods meet the needs of the Siamese people. As for prices, they are as cheap as ever, mostly lower than British and American goods. Moreover, Siamese merchants who deal in Japanese goods earn more profit than with other goods. This is the main reason for the dumping of Japanese goods in the country.

If necessary, it will still be determined by the Salt Affairs Bureau.

[News Report] London, July 7th Broadcast: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated at a press conference that the British government is viewing the deterioration of the situation in Berlin with a serious attitude. Regarding whether the demonstration by the Berlin Socialist Unity Party will affect the Four Power talks, he declined to comment.

[News Report] London, July 7th News Despatch from Berlin: The Western military governors considered lodging a joint protest with the Soviet side on the matter of the Communist Party's seizure of the Berlin municipal government on the 7th. According to a U.S. spokesman, the U.S., British, and French governors will first collectively discuss taking joint action before holding another meeting. The Communist Party has stated that it will prevent the City Council from meeting again, which is a prelude to the Communist Party establishing another government in the Soviet-occupied zone.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, July 7th] The three commanders of the western districts of Berlin held a meeting this morning to study the situation after yesterday's incident caused by the meeting of the Berlin City Senate. The meeting was held in the public building of Colonel Holley, the commander of the Berlin American district.

[Associated Press, Berlin, July 7th] Berlin German Communist leaders announced on the 7th that they had completely broken off relations with the German municipal government in the Western-occupied zone, so Berlin has formally split into two cities. Two hours before the seventh meeting of the Four-Power Military Governors, the German Communist Party convened 150 Allied and German journalists. Li Deqi announced that the Socialist Unity Party (Communist Party) does not intend to participate after the municipal government moved to the Western-occupied zone.

[Associated Press, Berlin, July 7th] The Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone announced on the 7th that it had completely severed relations with the Germans in the Western-occupied zone, and its actions clearly divided everything in Berlin politically into two. Twenty-four hours after the Communist action group, supported by the Soviet army, forcibly broke into the municipal government, the Soviet-controlled newspaper attempted to incite a new riot, calling on the Communist action group to launch a new massive parade against "fascist warmongers and splitters of Berlin." The seventh meeting of the Four Military Governors was originally scheduled to be held at 4 p.m. today, but the emergence of a new crisis made it less obvious. Officials emphasized that the Communist riot had no direct impact on the Governors' meeting. However, the U.S. military governor requested a report on the matter, and it is generally feared that the Communist rioters may destroy the opportunity to restore the Four-Power joint administration of Berlin.

### Berlin City Council Disturbed, Moves to British-Occupied Zone for Meeting, Soviets Connive German Police to Arrest Large Numbers of People

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, June 6th] The Berlin City Council abandoned its assembly hall in the Soviet zone today and moved to the British-occupied zone's student building for a meeting, which is the first time since the Allied forces occupied Berlin. The reason why the City Council made this decision is that this morning, more than a thousand Communist demonstrators in front of the original City Council hall in the Soviet zone destroyed the doors and broke into the meeting place, and kidnapped Kaiser, the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party. When the demonstrators destroyed the meeting place, the police in the Soviet zone did not make efforts to stop them, and sometimes even assisted the demonstrators in breaking into the meeting place. Until 2 p.m., Communist demonstrators were still lining up in front of the meeting place, holding slogan flags and demanding "the signing of a peace treaty with Germany." Under this situation, the City Council decided to postpone the meeting.

Subsequently, City Council Speaker Zole decided to convene a special meeting in the British-occupied zone. Most of the members attended except for the Communist members. Deputy Mayor Feidensburg warned the members at the special meeting that although the City Council sincerely hopes that an agreement can be reached between the four Allied countries, it must also guard against the failure of the four-country talks.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, July 7th] After more than a thousand Communists broke into the City Senate Building in the Soviet zone of Berlin yesterday to prevent the City Senate from meeting and causing incidents, more than a hundred people have been arrested by the German police, and sixty people have been detained in the police station. Among them, thirty are guards of the Senate, eighteen are officials of the municipal government, thirteen are civilians, and dozens of journalists have been released. The City Senate Building is still surrounded by the German police, and the police are strictly controlling entry and exit. People entering and leaving must verify their identity cards.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, June 6th] Tonight, Soviet police broke into the liaison office between the U.S. authorities and the Berlin municipal government, arrested 36 municipal police officers, and destroyed the doors. In addition, four Soviet police officers went to the British liaison office and demanded that all Germans in the liaison office be handed over.

### The Soviet Union Accuses Italy of Violating the Peace Treaty, Italy's Reply Refutes It

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, July 7th] The Italian government refuted the Soviet government's accusation that Italy had failed to transfer the Italian warships to the Soviet Union in accordance with the terms of the Italian Peace Treaty.

### South Communists Call on Balkan Countries to Resist the Communist Information Bureau, Internal Division in the Iron Curtain Damages Soviet Prestige

[Associated Press, Prague, July 7th] The Yugoslav Communist Party, through its mouthpiece "Borba" newspaper, called on all Balkan countries on the 7th to rise up and rebel against the Communist International Information Bureau. The editorial reflects the views of the South Communists, stating that it is defying the Kremlin-controlled Information Bureau again, and said that the Bureau's accusations against the South Communists are tantamount to turning the spear against oneself, and giving Western imperialists a handle. It also said that the South state "never forgets its responsibility, which is to make the country a fortress of the anti-imperialist front in this part of Europe."

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, June 6th] Yugoslav Lieutenant Colonel Dacic, attempting to cross the Vietnamese-Hungarian border, presumably intending to go to the Soviet Union, has been arrested by border police.

If the Soviet Union's position continues to weaken, the Soviet leaders may have to take action in order to restore their prestige and tighten control over their satellite countries.

Polish Communists Begin Purging Party, Situation in Czech Republic Worthy of Attention

[Associated Press, Warsaw, June 6th] Observers here predict that after the dismissal of Polish Communist Party Secretary-General Gomulka, one-quarter to one-third of the 1 million members of the Polish Communist Party will be "purged." Observers have different opinions on the timing of the "purge" of the right-wing Communists. Some people say that the purge will begin soon. Others say that the purge will be delayed until after the completion of the merger of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

[Associated Press, London, June 6th] Yugoslav Marshal Tito's almost unbelievable public defiance of the Kremlin has spread to Poland on the 6th. Stalin is facing the defection of important figures in the Iron Curtain, South and Poland, while he is conducting important negotiations with Western countries in the Cold War. Who will be the next to defect among the Soviet Eastern European satellite countries? And how contagious is this matter? Western diplomats are closely watching Czechoslovakia, and are predicting that there will be demonstrations during the state funeral of former Czech President Benes on the 8th. Stalin is currently overwhelmed after the death of Zhdanov, the former head of the Communist International Bureau and supervisor of the Eastern European Communist Party.

### Soviet Officer Flees to England: Reveals Soviet War Preparations Secrets; Politburo Decisions Violate Public Opinion

[French News Agency, London, 6th] Soviet Army Colonel Tokaev, described as a "mysterious figure behind the scenes," who recently fled his country and arrived in London, held a press conference today. Correspondents from various Western newspapers attended, as did a correspondent from TASS. The TASS correspondent denounced Tokaev as a traitor and raised various questions. Tokaev replied, "I believe that exposing the kind of rule the Soviet people live under now will greatly help them. I have now left the Soviet Union, and I will not answer such questions. For the past thirty-eight years, I have been silent for my survival, but even if I now want to say what I want to say in my heart, it would be useless, because TASS news is enough to distort my words."

[United Press, London, 6th] Soviet jet propulsion expert Colonel Tokaev, formerly an aide to Marshal Sokolovsky, accused the Soviet Politburo on the 6th of preparing for a Third World War. Tokaev recently fled to the British zone of occupied Germany and then to England. He told United Press, "The Third World War is being prepared. The officials engaged in preparing for this are the fourteen members and candidate members of the Politburo. I know very well that the Politburo's policy, which is based on preparing for a Third World War, is absolutely not in line with the interests and needs of the Soviet people or the people of any country in the world, so I am unwilling to be a tool and partner in this policy. I disregarded participating in this policy and therefore left." (The Soviet Politburo is the highest executive body of the Soviet Communist Party. Its members include Premier Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov, among others.) Tokaev announced at a press conference that ninety percent of the Soviet people and seventy percent of Soviet Communist Party members would not support the current regime in a free election. Tokaev is the latest Soviet official to renounce his nationality and oppose his government. He, his wife, and two daughters have been living in a British cottage in recent months, fearing the Soviet secret police, and have requested that no photographs be taken.

### South Korean Political Corruption Disappoints US Officials; North-South Korean Dispute to be Submitted to the UN General Assembly

[United Press, Seoul, 7th] The North-South Korean dispute will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in Paris this month, but a real solution seems unattainable before the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops. From various perspectives, the South Korean government of Syngman Rhee appears to be on shaky ground. The South Korean government still lacks a strong military organization, and even its internal unity is questionable. Although the atmosphere was very optimistic when the South Korean parliament opened in Seoul on May 31st, US officials are disappointed by the corruption of the situation. The most disappointing thing is Syngman Rhee's first cabinet. Rhee has studied the governments of various countries around the world, but when he chooses his cabinet members, he does not select wise and capable officials, but only repays political debts. After the list of cabinet members was announced, they all abused their power for personal gain, and various political groups competed for control of the armed forces. If South Korea is to prepare for the anti-communist struggle that is coming, it will require the greatest efforts of the United States and even greater assistance from the South Korean people themselves.

### French Cabinet Discusses New Economic Reforms; Schuman Expected to Overcome Difficulties; Communist and Right-Wing Members to Submit Motions

[United Press, Paris, 7th] The first item in the Schuman government's economic reform plan is to distribute an August living allowance to every worker. Now, his new coalition cabinet will face its first test in the National Assembly on the 7th. Communist and right-wing members have raised questions about the government's organization and its economic policies. However, the government, which was formed this weekend, is expected to safely overcome this major hurdle.

During a meeting of the Schuman cabinet on the evening of the 5th, the first item of business was to stipulate that a subsidy of eight francs be distributed to all workers in private industry for the months of July and August. At the same time, the cabinet increased the price of bread from 24 francs (8 cents) to 35 francs (11 cents) per 2.2 pounds. At the same time, in order to concretely reduce government spending, the cabinet ordered some departments to immediately lay off staff, while other departments would gradually reduce staff. Government spokesman Midland said: Other economic reforms include tax cuts, lower meat prices, increased family rations, and a decision on the September living allowance. Schuman may ask parliament to extend the discussion of the government's economic policies to reduce the government's difficulties. He can also accept the discussion, and if possible, he can even ask parliament to vote for an early recess.

### Nehru Officially Announces to Parliament: Hyderabad Intrusion Offends; Indonesia Asks Hyderabad to Stop Terrorist Actions

[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru told Parliament on the 7th that Indian and Hyderabad armies had engaged in battle within Indian territory. Nehru said that the government received reports on the 6th that Hyderabad troops had invaded, and that the invading troops were the Razakars of Hyderabad. The Razakars are a radical Muslim organization that supports Hyderabad's independence and opposes Hyderabad joining the Indian Union. Nehru said that the navy attacked with armor, but was repelled, destroying one vehicle and capturing one officer and eighty-five soldiers.

[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru announced on the 7th that India had requested to station troops in Hyderabad in order to "restore law and order in the state." The Hyderabad prince has refused the Indian troops' request to enter. Nehru said, "We may be on the eve of a serious incident in the country." He also said that India has made a "final" request that the prince disband the radical Muslim group Razakars and stop their terrorist actions.

### Byrnes Calls for US-Soviet Resumption of Negotiations: "For the Sake of Both the US and the Soviet Union, Efforts Should be Renewed to Reach Consensus on a Treaty with Germany."

[United Press, Seattle, 6th] Former US Secretary of State Byrnes today called for a resumption of negotiations with the Soviet Union and defended the Yalta Agreement, saying that without the agreement, the Soviet Union would have gained more territory in China and Japan. Byrnes called on Western countries to resume negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German issue, saying that even if the Soviet Union has the possibility of further aggression, "we cannot therefore give up all hope of peace talks."

Yalta Agreement: China Agreed in Advance

Looking back on the events that occurred during his tenure, Byrnes said that China had already fully agreed to the Soviet Union's demands at Yalta. Byrnes said that only when he learned that Molotov had made further demands on China in Moscow in July 1945 did he state to the Chinese people: "The United States does not support the Soviet Union in making further demands on China." Byrnes emphasized that the reasonableness of the Soviet Union's demands should be judged based on the time period. At that time, without the Yalta Agreement, the Soviet Union would have gained more territory in China. He pointed out that the Yalta Agreement was held six weeks after the Cherbourg campaign. At that time, no one dared to say when the war would end. Furthermore, the atomic bomb had not yet been invented, and military leaders estimated that attacking the Japanese mainland would require one million soldiers. He said, "If we had to attack Japan at that time, and if it had continued for six months, the Soviet Union might have already actually occupied all the land that the Yalta Agreement agreed to cede. And if there had been no Yalta Agreement, the land occupied by the Soviet Union would have been even larger." Byrnes raised several questions, saying: If the United States had to attack Japan, would the American people—especially parents—want the Soviet Union to stay out of it? Could the United States prevent the Soviet Union from participating in anything? Furthermore, if the Soviet Union joined the war, and at the same time there was no agreement agreeing that MacArthur would be the supreme commander, would we encounter similar problems in Japan as we encountered in Europe?

US-Soviet Agreement: Not Actually a Surrender

Byrnes defended the previous agreements between the US and the Soviet Union, saying, "Some people think that all mediation is nothing more than surrender. This is a dangerous misconception. If we want to work for peace, we should not destroy all hope of peace talks for fear of high costs." He said that based on his personal experience, it is indeed not easy to deal with the Soviet Union, but efforts should still be made. Byrnes declared that Soviet leaders would not rashly participate in a war unless they thought they could defeat us. They believe that war is a necessary means for national survival. Since Soviet leaders are afraid of war, they probably will not miss any opportunity to increase their power and status without war. The Czech incident this spring is a clear example of this. Byrnes said that in order to "maintain peace," the United States' military buildup plan should be maintained, but "most importantly, other countries should recognize that the United States does not want to control any country. As for the European countries, which have often suffered from war, they certainly do not want their territory to become a battlefield for competing with the Soviet Union." "We must convince them that we are their allies fighting to preserve freedom, and we do not want to use them as collateral or as satellite countries in the struggle with the Soviet Union."

The People of the Soviet Union Also Do Not Want War

Byrnes said, "Some people say that because of the Soviet Union's attitude, we have realized that we cannot build one world, we must build two worlds. This pessimistic view also has some reason, but I do not give up hope. Before this, we have also seen governments change their policies. We do not know what is behind the iron curtain, but the Eastern European countries feel uneasy about it. We can conclude that the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the United States absolutely do not want war. So we hope that the Soviet people's desire for peace and improving their living standards can influence the Soviet leaders to change their policies." "For the sake of both the US and the Soviet Union, we should renew our efforts to reach a consensus on a treaty with Germany. If Germany becomes collateral or an assistant in the struggle between the East and the West, it will not benefit either the United States or the Soviet Union." Byrnes concluded his speech by saying, "As long as people are willing to come together to discuss problems, even if the words are somewhat disrespectful, there will eventually be hope for an agreement. But if someone stops negotiating, the other negotiators had better prepare for war."

Disarm Germany: Withdraw Troops from All Countries

Byrnes' call comes in the wake of hopes that the four foreign ministers may reopen negotiations in the fall. Byrnes intends to use the following points as a reference for the agreement:

First, "Germany...should be disarmed and remain so for at least a generation. This is in the great interest of both the US and the Soviet Union." Second, "When a suitable German government is established, the troops of the four occupying countries should be withdrawn immediately. A small number of security forces will remain to monitor Germany's disarmament." Byrnes acknowledged that both sides cannot trust each other, but he said, "Therefore, there needs to be a treaty...Germany should be disarmed for forty years." Two years ago, Byrnes himself made this suggestion to the Soviet Union. Mentioning that international co-management of the Ruhr region may cause disputes, Byrnes said that the management of the Ruhr "may be handed over to Germany's neighbors." As for compensation and other disputes, Byrnes said, "The Soviet Union should not gain more than what it already has in the Potsdam Agreement."

### Fifteen Underground Banks Busted Under Order of the Financial Control Bureau; Heads Released on Bail Pending Account Audits

[Our Reporter] The Financial Control Bureau recently received a secret order from the Economic Control Committee to severely crack down on underground banks. Chiang Ching-kuo, the Supervisor, submitted a blacklist of underground bank operations. After receiving the order, the Bureau made a detailed action plan in advance, hoping to catch them all in one fell swoop.

### One Brokerage Firm Violates the Law; Will be Subject to Suspension

[Our Reporter] The person in charge of Dingxin Fumingji Brokerage, No. 14, Xiangkang Lane, Tianjin Road in this city, is Xu Songsun, director of the Xinxin Market Office of Nantong County Bank.

It has been verified by the Financial Control Bureau of this city that there are as many as nineteen brokerage firms in this city that have dealings with this firm, with frequent daily receipts and payments, with the largest amount exceeding one hundred billion yuan, and the average amount also between fifty and sixty billion yuan.

Therefore, it was decided to first restore the Route 7 bus from Central Park to the Bund of Central East Road starting from the 10th of this month, and then restore the Route 2A bus after considering the industry situation.

### Yongtaihe Smuggling Cigarettes: Turned Over to Yizhong for Sale at Controlled Prices; Confiscated Hoarded Yarn Reported to the Ministry for Instructions on Handling

The sale of other confiscated materials is currently under discussion.

### Chen Lifu Attends Tea Party: Welcomed by Various Sectors; Reports on His Impressions of His Recent Trip Abroad; Praises the Democratic Spirit of Britain and America

[Our Report] Various sectors of this city held a tea party at the Lido Garden at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to welcome Vice President Chen Lifu and his wife, who had just returned from overseas. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Tao Xisheng, Wu Kaixian, Zhao Zukang, Li Ximou, Ni Bi, Xu Xueyu, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jifei, and others attended. Vice President Chen arrived to the sound of military music, while his wife was unable to attend due to a foot ailment. Mayor Wu, as chairman, delivered a welcoming speech, praising Chen as a visionary in the struggle between democratic and communist ideologies, whose vision was the farthest-reaching, and who was the strongest proponent of anti-communism in those years. Chen immediately rose amidst applause and briefly described the proceedings of the Moral Re-Armament Conference. He said that the conference has a ten-year history, and its host, Dr. Buchman, had traveled to China, met with the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and had a deep affection for China. The theories he espoused were also similar to Chinese philosophy. The Moral Re-Armament Conference originated in Oxford, England, where a few people deeply felt the threat of materialism and that democracy had no theory to combat it, hence the initiation of the conference. After its establishment, it had the greatest impact in Northern Europe and also had considerable influence in the South Hams area of England. In recent years, after it spread to the United States, the people there deeply felt that the development of material civilization was gradually reducing human love and that the future crisis was unpredictable, so they were happy to accept it, and it developed rapidly. The Moral Re-Armament Movement has four standards: honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love, and advocates that democratic politics should be based on morality, with the ultimate goal of world peace. At this conference, most of the participants had been to China, so they had a good impression of China. As for how this movement will develop in China, I have not yet thought about it at this time. In fact, China has had this virtue since ancient times; today, we know it but have not practiced it.

Personal Freedom: Absolutely Respected

Chen went on to talk about American democratic politics, saying that he had been personally invited to attend the Democratic and Republican Parties' conventions in Philadelphia and deeply felt their characteristics, which were the absolute respect for personal freedom, but at crucial moments, they could unite for the party and prevent rifts from occurring. In politics, the use of people and money was completely transparent. The public can listen in on city council meetings. If more than half agree, they can also speak. He deeply felt that the greatest advantage of democratic politics is that it allows those in power to have regular contact with the people, and their words and deeds must represent the true interests of the people, resulting in clean and effective politics. As we begin constitutional governance, we must sincerely and earnestly learn from the strengths of other countries. At the same time, the completion of democratic politics still requires the virtue of patience.

Praising Britain: Spirit of Hard Work

Chen praised Britain's spirit of hard work and law-abidingness, saying that the Labour Party's policies were quite similar to those of the Father of the Nation. Britain suffered heavy losses during the war. Taking housing as an example, more than two million houses were destroyed by missiles, but the speed of its reconstruction was also surprising. "The results of rationing and control are particularly excellent. The domestic life of the rich and poor is consistent, and the best quality goods are used for export to earn foreign exchange. Comparing the material lives of the three countries—Britain, America and China, America is 'naturally endowed and has everything; Britain has nothing except for life necessities; and in our country, some have too much, and some have too little.'" The British pay special attention to abiding by the law, and the people have a high level of knowledge, so the implementation of government orders does not encounter any difficulties. The president of the Bank of England told me: After consulting with the heads of various trade associations on any economic plan, it can be implemented without obstruction, and the great power given to the government can be reserved and not used. The high efficiency of British politics can be seen from this.

Working Together: The Only Way to Succeed

Finally, Vice President Chen discussed the situation in China, saying that currency reform is by no means the solution to all economic problems. The current situation is still extremely serious, and we must work together to overcome the difficulties. I believe that there must be moral strength behind politics and economics. Everyone must start from themselves, and it requires the joint efforts of many people to succeed. Chen's speech lasted more than two hours. His words were precise and his attitude sincere, moving all who heard him. The welcome meeting ended at 5:45 PM.

### Typhoon Dissipates: Threat to the City Lifted; Clearing Skies Expected Today

[Our Report] The Pacific typhoon passed through the Taiwan Strait the day before yesterday. After its center reached the Fuzhou and Wenzhou area, it landed on the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang. Due to the resistance of the mountains, it dissipated after a night, and its force was greatly reduced. At the same time, its direction also began an arc-shaped change, gradually pointing from northwest-north to northeast-north. Yesterday morning, it went out to sea south of Ningbo, passed through the Zhoushan Islands in the evening, and continued to move northeast-north, but the speed was extremely slow. According to the meteorological station's prediction, the typhoon will dissipate in the East China Sea and become an ordinary low-pressure system. This city was not directly hit yesterday. The wind force in the concession area was around level 4 (the strongest typhoon force is level 17, which can reach 136 miles per hour). The sea surface outside Wusongkou still had a level 8 force. However, because the hurricane brought hot air, and the city was covered by cold air from North China in the previous days, the two met, resulting in torrential rain like a waterfall until yesterday afternoon. According to the meteorological station's statistics at 5:00 PM, the rainfall had reached 2.19 inches. Low-lying roads in the city were flooded again, especially the area near the three major companies on Nanjing Road and the area around Lin Sen Middle Road and Yuyuan Road, which became a vast expanse of water. The rain stopped by the evening, and the skies will begin to clear this afternoon. However, there may still be considerable waves at sea. Air and sea traffic are expected to return to normal completely from tomorrow.

Yesterday's minimum temperature was 23.2 degrees Celsius (73.7 degrees Fahrenheit), and the maximum temperature was 25.7 degrees Celsius (78.2 degrees Fahrenheit).

The Jiangya wheel on the Shanghai-Ningbo line suspended exports yesterday, and the Jiangjing wheel was in Ningbo and did not come. The Xilin, an express wheel on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, was also suspended yesterday and changed to sail to Tianjin this morning.

Pumping Stations Make Every Effort to Dredge

Also, news: Since 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, heavy rain has been pouring down in this city and it had not stopped by yesterday afternoon, this was the first heavy rain since autumn, causing water accumulation in various low-lying areas of the city. It is said that this accumulation of water was due to the high tide of the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek, which caused the drainage ditches to be unable to discharge the water, resulting in tidal backflow. The Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, immediately went to inspect the waterlogged roads in various districts with the Director of the Drainage Department, Lu Jifang. The roads with water accumulation included the front of the Xinxin Company on Guangxi Road, the intersection of Yunnan Road and Fuzhou Road, Fuzhou Road (between Yunnan Road and Zhejiang Road), the area between Sichuan Road and Erma Road, the area between Yunnan Road and Beihai Road, the intersection of Wuma Road and Zhejiang Road, and the intersection of Maoming Road (the Thirteen-Story Building), as well as Linsen Middle Road, Madang Road, Yingshi Road, and Shaanxi South Road, where the terrain was lower and the water was deeper. The Drainage Department of the Public Works Bureau immediately ordered the staff of the Rihui Port, Huaian Road, Ye Jiazhai Road, and other pumping stations to continuously dredge and drain the water.

### The Seventh General Assembly of the City Council: Opening Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow Morning; Two Additional Proposals from Councilors Received Yesterday

The two proposals received yesterday are as follows: (1) A proposal from Gu Baoyu, Pan Jiemei, and others: "It is proposed that the Economic Supervisor and the Municipal Authorities strictly crack down on illegal price increases in stores and vegetable markets to stabilize people's livelihoods." The three proposed measures are: 1. Send a letter to the Economic Supervisor and the Municipal Government to issue a notice allowing citizens to report as much as possible. 2. Order all police stations to send officers to investigate. Personnel who accept bribes or are corrupt will be severely punished. 3. If any store or vendor is found to be illegally increasing prices, they will be severely punished by being transferred to the court for sentencing, or their business license will be revoked. (2) A proposal from Baoyu and others: "It is proposed that the Central Government investigate the personnel who leaked the secret of selling the old Wing On Yarn shares and thoroughly investigate the figures behind them to maintain national law." The proposed method is: Petition the President to order the police and the Control Yuan to investigate the personnel who leaked the secret of selling Wing On Yarn shares and strictly investigate the figures behind them to prevent anyone from escaping justice.

### Social Affairs Bureau Holds Thrifty Guidance Conference: Launches "Use National Products" Campaign; Bans the Manufacture of Extravagant Mooncakes; Restricts Consumption of Eggs and Peanuts

[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau convened a thrift supervision meeting yesterday morning, inviting agencies such as the Police Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang. Chairman Wu Kaixian stated briefly: Shanghai is currently the most extravagant place. The wealthy and powerful indulge in extreme luxury. During this time of suppression and chaos, it is imperative to strengthen thrift. In the United States, the government stipulates that meat should not be eaten on Fridays. I hope that this can also be implemented in China. China has abundant production of eggs and peanuts. If we can conserve, we can transport them abroad and earn a lot of foreign exchange. Also, Chinese people eat too much beef, and many plowing oxen are killed, which is really a waste. In Britain, products that can earn foreign exchange cannot be bought in the country. This is something we should emulate. Subsequently, four resolutions were passed: (1) Launch a "Chinese People Use Chinese Goods" campaign, hoping that by next year, all Chinese people will wear Chinese cloth. (2) Stipulate the price of Mid-Autumn mooncakes, not to exceed five jiao per piece, and prohibit the manufacture of extravagant mooncakes. (3) Absolutely prohibit gift-giving during the Mid-Autumn Festival and actively launch campaigns to encourage people to save money from gift-giving to use for comforting the troops. (4) Investigate the actual production of eggs and peanuts and draft conservation measures.

### Police Bureau Forbids Giving and Receiving Holiday Gifts: Discovery Leads to Dismissal

[Our Report] The Yuanpei, the China Merchants Bureau's express liner on the northern route from Shanghai to Tianjin, returned to Shanghai from Tianjin on the morning of the 6th and sheltered from the wind in Qingdao yesterday afternoon.

It was discovered to be opium, but no one claimed it. The ship's captain requested the head office to send police officers from the police affairs group to inspect the ship upon arrival to clarify responsibility.

### Yu Shu, a Student at Tongji University, Requests the School to Accompany Him for Questioning

[Our Report] Yu Shu, a freshman in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the College of Engineering of National Tongji University, was previously summoned by the Shanghai Special Criminal Court but failed to appear. The student recently sent a letter to the school, stating that his ambition is to study and that he has never been involved in external affairs or participated in student movements. He is being summoned now, and out of respect for national law, he is willing to appear in court for questioning and requests the school to send someone to accompany him to listen to the questioning. In order to ensure that government orders are consistent and that merchants and people can enjoy practical benefits, it is proposed that your department order the tax bureaus of all provinces and regions to immediately stop collecting any supplementary tax payments beyond six times the original amount. Those who have already paid to the treasury should be allowed to verify and offset the tax payments due for the first half of the 37th year of the Republic, so that the methods of collection and exemption are not inconsistent. At this time of financial consolidation, it can also encourage tax reporting.

### Embezzling Settlement Allowance for Lending at Interest: Prosecuting District Chief and Four Others

[Our Report] Ye Zhenquan, the district chief of Penglai District in this city; Wang Naifeng, a clerk of the district office; Zhang Shijun, a district team leader; Yan Shouzhang, a cashier; and Ding Yanxiang, an assistant, were recently accused by residents of the district of embezzling settlement allowances after collecting them for this year's conscription. Instead of transferring them to the Civil Affairs Bureau, they used their positions for personal gain by lending them out at interest, which is suspected of being a group embezzlement. After several investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office, a public prosecution for embezzlement was filed against Ye and the other four.

### Not Intentionally Trying to Kill His Sister: Only Wanting to Make Her Aware; The Case of the Socialite Injured in the Buttocks Concludes

[Our Report] The case of the socialite Su Shanhu (originally named He Shouyu) being repeatedly threatened by her adoptive younger brothers, He Zhisong and He Zhixiong, and ultimately injured with a military knife, was previously prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office as attempted murder. The District Court concluded its hearing yesterday and scheduled sentencing for the 14th of this month. When Judge Zhang Yuanzhen of the District Court opened the hearing yesterday afternoon, He Zhisong and He Zhixiong were mentioned. Su Shanhu, who had recovered from her injuries, wore a blue cheongsam and was accompanied by her mother to court to answer questions. In court, she was asked why He Zhisong repeatedly threatened her with a gun and ultimately stabbed his sister. This nineteen-year-old, petite first defendant answered in broken Mandarin, with a cadence and rhythm that resembled reciting lines from a play. However, the meaning of his testimony showed that there were circumstances in this case beyond what the indictment stated, that "Shouyu and her two brothers had a deep rift." Zhisong testified: "I was very naughty when I was young. Later, I served as an apprentice sailor on a naval warship. Life at sea made me feel lonely. Year after year, I was far from home and received no comfort. My sister had a high status in society. I asked her to help me, but she was a person without feelings, so I hated her. I didn't want to kill her, I just wanted to make her aware and help others." The court nodded frequently upon hearing this testimony. The second defendant, He Zhixiong, originally Shouyu's cousin, strongly denied the allegation of conspiracy, claiming that it was Zhisong's doing and had nothing to do with him, and requested the court to declare him innocent. The debate then began. According to the allegations, the defendants were adopted as younger brothers by He Shouyu due to their poor circumstances. Because He Shouyu frequented social scenes and did not focus on household affairs, a deep rift developed between her and her two brothers. The defendants threatened Shouyu with a gun three times on May 29th, June 10th, and July 1st. Finally, on July 3rd, Zhisong stabbed Shouyu in the buttocks with a military knife. The two were arrested by the police and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution on charges of attempted murder.

### Traffic Safety Campaign to Begin Tomorrow

### National Bank Not Exchanging: Pounds and Rupees

### Foreigners Must Provide Chinese Translations: Otherwise, We May Not Accept Them

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In the past, when foreign nationals communicated with Chinese government agencies, they sometimes used their native languages, which was very inconvenient for the handling agencies. The Executive Yuan has recently stipulated that in the future, when foreign nationals communicate with Chinese central and local government agencies, if the agency deems it necessary to present a Chinese translation, it may order them to do so. Otherwise, the Chinese government may not accept it. In addition, if foreign consulates stationed in various parts of China communicate with local agencies using languages other than Chinese, the local agencies may, if necessary, consult with the consulates to submit Chinese translations.

### Gao Keng Coal Mine

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

This time, the opening of the Zhangshu-Zhuzhou section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway benefited from the assistance of Deputy Director Wang Yuankang of the Nanchang Office of the Railway Bureau and the efforts of Engineer Lin Yuesheng of the Nan-Chun Section Engineering Office, as well as the efforts of Chen Bangshu, the assistant manager of the Guanghan Xi Coal Bureau. Our reporter was able to quickly go west to Gao Keng, the only large coal mine in Jiangnan in the current stage. What I have observed will be recorded in detail below:

[Report from our Nanchang dispatch on the 4th] The history of Pingxiang Coal Mine dates back forty years, to March of the 24th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, when Zhang Zhidong and Sheng Xuanhuai jointly petitioned the Qing court for its establishment. At that time, the general manager of the coal mine was Zhang Zanchen, and the mining area was in Anyuan, about four kilometers from the county seat of Pingxiang County. The first total output was 10,000 tons. After the outbreak of the First World War, the output in the fifth year of the Republic of China reached 950,000 tons, which was the peak of coal production in the past forty years. According to the report of the Jiangxi Geological Survey Institute, the Pingxiang coal-producing areas include Anyuan and Gao Keng. The Anyuan area is the main part of this area

Main Body of Pingxiang Mine

Its scope starts from Anyuan, goes northeast through Baxianchong to Wangjiayuan, circles Zijia Chong, Tianzi Mountain to the south, passes through Xiaokeng Shuangfeng Chong, follows the Nanlu River to Wupoxie, and then follows the road from Wupoxie to Anyuan. The coal reserves in this area are few, after forty years of mining. Therefore, the Jiangxi Coal Mining Bureau has shifted its mining focus to Gao Keng.

The Gao Keng area is located southeast of Anyuan, its scope extending east from Baxian Chong, passing through Wangjiayuan, further northeast through Longjia Chong, Gao Keng, reaching Gaogangbu, then west from Gaogangbu, passing through Luanshi Ling, turning southwest through Yunjubu, Chahengli, Jiuliping, and reaching Anyuan.

The geological era of the Pingxiang coal-producing strata has been determined by successive geological surveys to belong to the Lower Jurassic of the Mesozoic Era. According to general survey results:

(1) Permian, (2) Triassic, (3) Jurassic, (4) Tertiary, (5) Quaternary.

Geological Structure

in the Pingxiang Coal area is extremely complex, and its relationship with the coal seam seems to be the closest with the Baipiao Pa orogenic movement. Therefore, the main geological structure of Pingxiang coal is a torsional fault. This fault trends roughly east-northeast to southwest, extending for about five kilometers. When the Pingxiang Mine was originally developed, when the main level tunnel reached the above boundary, it encountered rock layer fractures and once collapsed. After several twists and turns, it was penetrated, which is also sufficient evidence for the existence of the fault zone.

There are more than ten coal seams in the coal series in this area, the main ones being Peng Mine and Da Mine, which are very close to each other. The shale between them is less than half a meter, and some are separated by about two meters. The thickness of the two coal seams varies greatly, averaging about four meters. In Gao Keng, the thickness is about four meters, while in Xiaokeng to Huangkeng, the thickness varies. The secondary coal seams include Yijia Mine, Sanjia Mine, Yanzi Mine, Yingzi Mine, Magu Mine, and Saobian Mine.

According to the survey by the Coal Mining Bureau, the minable coal seams and thickness in the Gao Keng area are as follows:

Table of Minable Coal Seam Thickness in Gao Keng

Area Coal Seam Thickness

Gao Keng Yanzi Mine 1 to 1.6 meters

Yingzi Mine 0 to 1.3 meters

Peng Mine 0.2 to 1.4 meters

Da Mine 2 to 4.5 meters

Magu Mine 0.2 to 2.3 meters

The coal quality of Pingxiang Coal is very good, but in recent years, private earth pit miners have disregarded their reputation and mixed in rock chips and black soil, resulting in a sharp decline in the reputation of the coal. Now, the Jiangxi Coal Mining Bureau is working hard to improve and restore its past reputation. It is reported that the current Pingxiang Coal contains very little ash and only about 0.5% sulfur, making it suitable for coking. Magu Mine and Yijia Mine coal are harder, so there are more lumps. In the Zijia Chong area, lump coal accounts for 46%, while Da Mine coal is looser and lump coal accounts for about 10%.

According to the chemical analysis of Gao Keng coal entrusted by the Jiangxi Coal Mining Bureau to the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau on January 10 this year:

Chemical Analysis

is shown in the following table:

Coal Seam Moisture Volatile Carbon Carbon Powder Sulfur BTU Thoughts of Military

Mixed Coal from the First Well 2.44 23.18 54.04 20.34 1.27 12065

Mixed Coal from the Third Well 2.19 23.44 58.60 15.77 0.8 12868

Mixed Coal from the Fourth Well 2.29 21.95 55.94 18.82 0.3 12207

According to the 1937 report of the Jiangxi Geological Survey Institute, the remaining coal reserves in the Pingxiang Mine area (Zijia Chong to Xiaokeng, and Anyuan to Huangkeng area) are 8,600,000 tons. According to the 1933 survey report by Zhu Qian et al. in the Gao Keng area (Gao Keng to Wangjiayuan area), the reserves are 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 tons. Recently, the Coal Mining Bureau estimated that the reserves in the Gao Keng area are about 63,000,000 tons based on geological surveys and drilling records. However, due to the complex geological changes in the Gao Keng area and the incomplete drilling work, the coal deposits near Gaogangbu are difficult to estimate. If there is sufficient exploration equipment to continue drilling, and if there is an extended coal field near Gaogangbu, then the total reserves will be more than this. Based on the current estimated reserves, assuming a mining efficiency of 80%, the coal production should be more than 50 million tons. If the annual production is 1.5 million tons, the coal reserves in the Gao Keng area can be mined for more than 30 years.

Gao Keng Coal Mining

Currently, mechanical operations are not fully implemented. Instead, over 1,500 miners use their arms to dig out the coal from the bottom layer of the mine. The daily output is about 300 tons. However, the daily output of private earth pit mines in the Pingxiang Mine area should not be underestimated. Even considering the hand-pushed carts used to transport coal from the mining area to the city, nearly 20,000 of them travel on the coal road into the city every day, and the coal they push is entirely dug out by private earth pit mines.

### Large Quantities of Chongming Corn Leaving the Country

[Report from our Chongming dispatch on the 6th] After the new corn came on the market, large quantities have been continuously exported from Nanmenbao Town through the two ports, with the number being quite large. The destinations are generally unknown. The general public believes that this year's harvest has been greatly reduced, and such large export will cause food safety concerns. The authorities have publicly stated: "The province only allows the free transportation and sale of food. For the sake of maintaining local food supply, the county stipulates that corn exported must be exchanged for rice to be brought back to Chongming."

### Reorganization of Fengxian Chamber of Commerce

[Report from our Fengxian dispatch on the 5th] The two-year term of the first council of the County Chamber of Commerce has expired. The third county-wide representative assembly was convened on the 5th to elect half of the members by drawing lots, as per regulations. Sixty-some people including representatives of various industries and heads of branch offices attended. Section Chief Chen Shiliang of the County Government and Chiang Wen-shih representing the Party Headquarters were present to guide and supervise the election. As a result of the drawing of lots, six people including Fang Zanyao were removed, and six replacements including Bao Yongliang were elected. At the same time, the Chamber's constitution was amended to add two directors, and Liu De-dian was elected as the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce for the current term, with Wu Jincai and five others as standing members. The handover is scheduled for the 10th.

### Haining Tide

Continues to Surge onto the Dike

Number of Special Train Viewers Increases Daily

[Report from our Haining dispatch on the 6th] This year, the sand outside the dikes in this county has completely collapsed, so the autumn tide is particularly large. Many pick-up dams have been continuously destroyed by the surge. The seawalls near Chenwengang to Qilimiaomiao are in disrepair, with the situation being critical. The Jue Zihao seawall outside the south gate of the town also shows signs of subsidence. The Dike Works Bureau is currently rushing to repair them. The annual tide-watching festival on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month is approaching. On that day, there will also be a spring tide. Each time the tide comes, it surges onto the dikes, creating a spectacular sight. Special trains from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places come every day, and the number of tide-watchers is gradually increasing. It is predicted that the grand occasion on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month will be unprecedented.

### Scattered Bandits Loot Dried Cocoons, Yimin Cocoon Firm in Wuxi Loses 6,000 Gold Yuan

[Report from our Wuxi dispatch on the 7th] The Yimin Cocoon Firm in Xuewan was suddenly attacked by a large number of scattered bandits at 11 PM on the 7th. Twenty-six loads of dried cocoons were looted, resulting in a loss of more than 6,000 gold yuan.

### Iron Tree Blooms in Haizhou

[Report from our Haizhou dispatch on the 1st] There is an iron tree planted in the Haizhou Enemy and Pseudo-Industry Liquidation Office on Zhengzhong Road in Xinpu. It is more than sixty years old and has never bloomed. A few days ago, several branches suddenly grew, full of white flowers, the color of jade, shaped like copper bells, hanging down heavily. Locals who came to view it thronged the road.

### Famous Soprano Vocalist Guan Yixuan in the Northwest

— Our Reporter Binglin

[Report from our Dihua dispatch on the 5th] The nationally renowned soprano vocalist, Ms. Guan Yixuan, flew to Dihua on July 17th at the invitation of General Zhang Wenbai, Director of the Northwest Cultural Construction Association, and held three solo concerts. When she held a solo concert at the Soviet Consulate on the 24th, four broadcasting devices were specially installed in Peace Square, so that tens of thousands of people of all ethnic groups who love singing and dancing had a chance to listen. Deputy Consul Wu of the Soviet Consulate also praised Ms. Guan's artistic achievements. The Deputy Consul's wife also presented flowers to Ms. Guan on behalf of more than one hundred Soviet residents in Dihua. After Ms. Guan's three solo concerts ended, she leisurely toured the Tianchi Lake, which she had always longed for, and stayed for four days, returning from Tianchi only on the afternoon of the 29th.

Xinjiang Music Has Extremely High Talent

The Youth Song and Dance Troupe, which had previously performed Xinjiang songs and dances in Beijing and Shanghai, specially performed border ethnic songs and dances for Ms. Guan that night, dispersing only after 2 AM. When the reporter asked her to express her opinions on border songs and dances, she said excitedly: "Xinjiang's music is extremely cheerful and quite rhythmic. The talent for singing is also extremely high, but it is a pity that they have not used modern scientific methods for pronunciation and singing practice. However, this ethnic music can be spread and promoted to the Central Plains to stimulate the unity and joy of all ethnic groups..."

Secretary-General Liu Presented a Poem

She collected many folk songs in Xinjiang and asked Director He of the Translation Office of the Northwest Chief Executive's Office to translate them into Chinese. When Ms. Guan was about to fly east, Liu Mengchun, the Secretary-General of the Chief Executive's Office, wrote a poem entitled "A Trip to Tianchi": "The majestic energy flows from the west, the peaks of the Tianshan Mountains are always white-headed, a thousand peaks melt into ten thousand acres of gentleness, lush and green waves float like jade. Dense ancient pines pierce the sky, I whip my horse to the highest peak, the sky wind blows the song and the clouds collect it, the green mountains bow their heads and listen to the pure sound, the cypress water dresses as a dragon swims, the graceful posture merges with the immortals, this realm can be encountered but not sought. It is a pity that I could not stay for ten days, the bright moon in the long sky is full of emotion!"

When Ms. Guan flew east through the state of her jurisdiction, she discussed the matter of establishing a new art school with General Zhang Wenbai. She also hoped to introduce Xinjiang folk songs abroad.

A Letter from the Flower of the Uygur

Recently, Guan Yixuan had a letter sent from Wuhan to Ms. Kambalhan. The letter is extracted and recorded below:

"Ms. Kambalhan: I was extremely pleased and honored to meet you during my trip to the Northwest. While in Dihua, I was extremely touched that you and your husband visited the lodging several times! I am also grateful for the warm hospitality of your troupe's songs and dances. I will always cherish this precious friendship. I especially thank you and your husband and all the members of your troupe!

"I stayed in Minzhou for three days on my way. Director Zhang (referring to General Zhang Wenbai) expressed great concern for Xianyou and others, and inquired about everything in detail. I have already mentioned the matter of establishing an art school to Director Zhang. He has had this idea for a long time, but it is only a matter of funding. I sincerely hope that your plan can be realized soon! If Xinjiang's songs and dances can receive formal school training, there is no doubt that they can be further developed and promoted. I love their energetic, joyful, and enthusiastic emotions. If they can be widely developed, they will indeed be a precious elixir for the entire Chinese nation. I hope that the authorities will continue to promote them, and I hope that you will continue to lead Xinjiang's songs and dances to a bright future!

Go to North Platform Before Going to France

This spring, I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and plan to go to Europe to study and observe the music and art of various Western countries in the near future. I recently received a telegram from Paris inviting me to go to France in September, but I would like to hold concerts in Beiping and Taiwan before leaving the country, so I am afraid that I will not be able to go abroad on time. I would also like to collect more folk songs from various places so that I can introduce purely Chinese songs abroad. When I was in Dihua, I asked people to collect Xinjiang folk songs several times. According to a member of a certain troupe, several kinds of song scores had been handed over to Mr. He Guanggui for forwarding to me, but they have never been received, which I find very regrettable. Now I especially ask you to find a way to send me several Xinjiang folk songs. If you can translate the lyrics into Chinese, it will be even more welcome. I am very sorry for the trouble and thank you in advance!

"The weather in Wuhan is extremely hot and humid, which makes me miss the coolness of Dihua, and those sweet melons and fruits, especially those emotional and friendly people! There is also the snow on the Tianshan Mountains and the water in Yaochi (i.e., Tianchi), all of which are unforgettable! If there is another opportunity in the future, I would like to visit you again!..." Guan Yixuan respectfully.

### Island of Wind and Fire: Hong Kong Two or Three Things

— Our Special Correspondent Zi Jian

[Report from our Hong Kong dispatch on the 4th] Old Hong Kong people say: Around the first day of the eighth lunar month, typhoons often strike Hong Kong. If there is a typhoon warning on the first day, then this typhoon is "extraordinary". On September 3 this year, which was clearly the first day of the eighth lunar month, the typhoon named "Gertrude" by American meteorologists was raging towards Hong Kong from the Philippines. Although the wind force was not very strong, traffic between Hong Kong and Kowloon was suspended for a morning and half an afternoon. People were still secretly rejoicing that this time it did not cause any disaster. However, disaster and the wind of the first day of the eighth lunar month seemed to have formed an historical and indissoluble bond with Hong Kong, but this time the disaster did not directly happen before the eyes of the general residents.

A Fast Train Causes a Tragedy

That afternoon, on a hillside more than 30 miles outside of Hong Kong, a fast train coming from Guangzhou was blown over by a gust of wind. Train derailments have almost lost their news value on the post-war railways, but batches of injured passengers were transported to Kowloon late at night, and the survivors painfully recounted the tragedy. The fourth carriage crashed into the third carriage, and then turned it over off the roadbed two feet high. According to the most conservative estimate, the number of deaths and injuries is at least 200 or more, which is not comparable to an ordinary train crash. As the reporter is writing, the railway bureau is still rushing to handle the aftermath and restore traffic, which is far from being realized. In addition to the typhoon, whether there were villains who deliberately removed the rail spikes in advance to sabotage the transportation artery between Guangdong and Hong Kong is currently under thorough investigation by the relevant authorities.

### Tibetan People Eke Out a Living

— Our Special Correspondent Xu Renchang

[Report from our Ya'an dispatch on the 2nd] The spiritual sustenance of the religious life of the Kang and Tibetan people lies in the holy places and the Living Buddhas, but in political life, it is just the opposite. Kang and Tibet are both cold and barren places with few products. The people work hard all year round and still find it difficult to obtain enough to eat. If the government and officials do not oppress them, they can barely maintain themselves. If they want to impose excessive taxes and levies, they will suffer cold and hunger.

Power over Life and Death

The political and religious power of the Lhasa government still reaches the west bank of the Jinsha River, including its jurisdiction over more than a dozen counties in Xikang. In terms of religious power, it has sent countless monastic and secular officials to the counties in Tibet proper and on the east bank of the Jinsha River to be their pawns and implement strict political and religious control. For the affiliated counties on the east bank of the Jinsha River, it has sent countless senior lamas, who are permanently stationed in various temples, to be the highest rulers of each temple. Tibetan laws only have a dozen or so provisions in principle and no detailed articles. In the work of governing, the temporary joy and anger of the officials is the law. It is not necessary to have a legal basis for handling civil affairs. Therefore, this group of monastic and secular officials has supreme power over the people in their jurisdiction, and absolute freedom over life and death. They not only represent the government in collecting taxes, but also freely increase the amount of taxes and pocket them. All the necessities of their daily life are taken from the people, from trivial matters such as firewood, grass, tea, and water, to onerous demands such as sexual needs, all of which are ordered by the people to provide. In addition to the actual consumption by them and their family members and servants, they also set up various kinds of names and collect cash, which is transported back to their hometowns for storage. In the event of disputes among the people, it goes without saying that officials openly solicit bribes to resolve them. Even if they want to see an official, they must first pay enough kowtow money. If the bribe is not as generous as that of the other party, then they may be beaten to death in court, or have their hands cut off and their eyes dug out, or be dismembered and fed to dogs, or burned in fire and water, which depends on the joy and anger of the officials at the time. There is no fixed standard. At the lightest, they will not die tragically, but their property will always be unable to be preserved. As for the lamas stationed in temples in the counties on the east bank of the Jinsha River, although their power is not as great as that of the monastic and secular officials in the west bank, they live off the land. Their lives are still taken from the local people, but the methods of extraction used are slightly different.

Methods of Resistance

The lives of the Kang and Tibetan people are already difficult, and it is difficult for them to be self-sufficient. In addition, the insatiable plunder of officials and lamas makes it impossible for them to breathe. Grievances accumulate deep in their hearts, and they have never dared to express positive resistance. In this situation of deep hatred but not daring to actively resist, two passive forms of resistance naturally arise:

First, they ask the Bodhisattva to call them to die early so that they can escape the pain of reality and be reborn into the Western Pure Land they long for.

Second, if they encounter a possible opportunity, they will leave their homes and flee into the areas under the jurisdiction of Han officials, to find another place to live. Whether they can die early cannot be arranged by human power, so the second method is available to them at any time. However, the punishments of the Tibetan officials are extremely cruel and their greed is especially great, because they also have to take money to pay homage to their superiors. If they are chased back halfway, they can forget about living, and their property will not be preserved. Even if they have already fled to the area under the jurisdiction of Han officials, they will try every means to capture them back, and they will suffer the same tragic situation of family ruin and death. They have a common saying: "The best Tibetan official is not as good as the worst Han official."

Preventing Inward Orientation

In the past, Tibet had a philosophy that made a prophecy and revelation to the people: "In the future, our savior will come from the East." This sentence is firmly remembered in the minds of their people, and they are waiting for this savior from the East to come soon. Now that they are actually seeing the different styles of the Han and Tibetan governments and the officials they have sent, it further confirms the value of this prophecy and strengthens their inward psychology. They welcome the Han officials and are happy to see the majesty of the Han officials. However, the Tibetan officials and lamas know this situation well and know that it is quite dangerous for themselves. They always deliberately spread rumors to attack the Han officials to prevent the people from admiring the inland.

Modern Marvels All Rights Reserved

There is always a lot of news in Hong Kong in September. On Journalists' Day, more than half of the colleagues not only slept less, but did not even have the time to sit down and drink a glass of wine to celebrate "their own holiday."

### Eleven Smugglers Are Very Daring

At about 2 AM one morning, Hong Kong Customs happily called each newspapers, saying that they had seized a batch of smuggled goods worth more than one million yuan, as well as a brand-new smuggling ship. Hearing the news, the reporter got out of bed, with sleepy eyes, and ran to the stone pier in front of the Customs. According to the customs officers: These eleven smugglers are very daring. They loaded the smuggled goods on the quiet sea behind Hong Kong, and even went to a nearby fish and seafood restaurant to have a drink. Just as they were drinking and having fun, the customs officers flew over and towed away the armed barge loaded with smuggled goods, and sent a large number of police officers to surround and capture the smugglers on the nearby coast. As a result, they all fell into the net one by one. This is a glorious victory in the anti-smuggling war. The reporter accompanied the customs people in their joy, and after coming back to write the manuscript, the sky was already bright.

### Hong Kong People "Turn Pale at the Mention of Fire"

One evening, the reporters were sitting down for a drink when they suddenly saw a plume of black smoke rising from the seaside. The fire department reported that the naval dockyard was on fire. "Forgetting self for the public good," some people put down their glasses and rushed to the destination. It turned out that the fire was only burning a corner of the naval dockyard. The fire god had visited a warehouse full of medical supplies. The lost medicines were worth 800,000 yuan in total, among which a large number of "Ruyi Bags" were stored!

In the past ten days, Hong Kong people have been "turning pale at the mention of fire." On the 23rd of last month, 300 barrels of caustic soda in the Kowloon Warehouse on the opposite shore caused a four-hour fire, burning goods (mostly foreign paper and chemical raw materials) covering an area of 24,000 square feet and worth seven or eight million yuan to ashes. Several post-war nouveau riche were also "restored" because of this fire. People "watched the fire from across the shore." The flames flew tens of feet high, which was shocking and unforgettable.

### Destroying Finance Reaps Bitter Fruit

It seems as if the heavens are deliberately playing a joke on journalists. Just the other day, there was a sensational piece of news in Hong Kong: Wing Shing Bank, a financial institution with a considerable reputation in the Hong Kong and China financial circles, closed down due to failed gold speculation. It is said that its owner, Mr. He, has always distrusted domestic currency. On the eve of the issuance of the Gold Yuan, amidst the great fluctuations in domestic finance, he purchased 50,000 taels of gold futures. On that day, the market price per tael rose sharply from 320 yuan to over 330 yuan. Mr. He made a profit of more than 500,000 yuan out of thin air, which made him extremely complacent. Unexpectedly, after the issuance of the Gold Yuan, the price of gold plummeted, with a difference of more than 50 yuan per tael before and after. When Mr. He saw the price of gold fall to 300 yuan, he still insisted on his distrust of domestic currency and refused to sell. When the price of gold "collapsed and became hopeless," Mr. He was ruined and closed the doors, fleeing in a hurry. Mr. He lost approximately two million yuan in this venture. This is a latest example of deliberately undermining finance and reaping the bitter fruit.

### Shen Guiying Case Re-examined and Confirmed; Trial Judge Liao Bin Dismissed and Investigated; Fugitive Clerks Ordered to Be Arrested

### Important Resolutions of the Materials Adjustment Committee: Southern Transport of Taiwan Sugar Prohibited Immediately; Export Licenses for Cotton Cloth to Be Handled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce

[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee of the Executive Yuan's Economic Control Commission held its second meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM in the National Bank conference room. Chairman Liu Gongyun, Vice-Chairman Li Lixia, Committee Members Lin Chongyong, Zhang Sunlan, Shen Xirui, Jiang Biao, Yang Chuo'an, Wang Ziseng, Shu Yunzhang, Shen Zhennan, Zhang Xiwei, and He Molin, Wang Qiyu, Liu Jianhua, and Chief Secretary Chen Shuzeng were in attendance.

First, Chairman Liu Gongyun reported on the National Bank's entrusted sale of sugar by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the joint sale of surplus materials by the Materials Supply Bureau and the National Bank, and the sale of enemy and puppet materials by the China Trust Bureau. The following important matters were resolved:

(1) The transport of food oil to the north is not restricted. (2) The transport of Taiwan sugar to the south is prohibited immediately. (3) The issuance of licenses for the transport of cotton cloth to the south will be handled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. (4) The Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Association's application for the allocation of raw silk to maintain production will be handled by the China Trust Bureau, which will sell 500 dan at the limited price first, and then gradually allocate more. (5) Regarding the supply of raw cotton to cotton mills in the next quarter of this year, it was decided that the national and private cotton mills should first draft a plan and submit it for discussion at the next meeting. (6) The large amount of Japanese wool stored by the China Trust Bureau will be sold off in batches soon.

Finally, the chairman emphasized the importance of the committee's role in materials adjustment and the close attention of the authorities. For example, Ho Hao-jo has been assigned to be responsible for the accelerated processing of enemy and puppet industries in order to quickly complete this long-pending and complicated work. At the same time, he hoped that the relevant agencies would cooperate closely to truly achieve the effect of overall materials adjustment.

[Also, News] The main materials adjusted by the Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee include the following five items: (1) Cooking oil, (2) Food grains, (3) Cotton yarn and cloth, (4) Sugar, (5) Fuel.

[Also, News] According to a person in charge of the committee, the first batch of US-aid cotton will be cleared through customs soon, and it is expected to be able to produce 60,000 bales of yarn, which will be allocated half for domestic sales and half for export.

[Also, News] The sugar market softened slightly yesterday because the He Sugar Company distributed coarse sugar again. The coarse sugar warehouse receipts fell to 28 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen. Spot goods also fell slightly to 29 yuan and 2 jiao. The sales of white sugar in hemp bags were limited. 40 bags of green sugar were offered at the limited price to regular dealers.

### Shenxin and Other Factories Sell on the Market; Abundant Supply of Cotton Yarn; Hot Trading in Cloth; Prices Decline Again

The cotton yarn market situation yesterday was such that, because Zhongfang (China Textile Industries Corporation), Shenxin, and other factories opened for sale in the market, the supply of yarn suddenly turned abundant. Within the price limits, both local and outside buyers were strong. The activity of the trading was unprecedented since the "August 19th" incident. However, because Longtou fine cloth fell below the limited price, there were not many new buyers. Re-manufacturing industries in the market directly purchased yarn from the cotton mills, so there was very little trading in fine yarn. The Fangjian Company continued to offer 20-count Lotus Heart, Red Bee, Clock Star, and Red Kuixing, all priced at 707 yuan. A total of 235 bales of coarse and fine yarn of various brands were traded, 109 bales more than the previous day.

Also, news: Zhongfang Company offered 30 bales of 10-count Golden Treasure Star at a price of 600 yuan.

Today, 222 bales were to be allocated, plus the 81 bales remaining from the previous day, for a total of 303 bales available for allocation today.

Also, news: The Zhongfang Business Department issued a public notice on the 19th of last month stating that any customer of the company who had borrowed tube yarn should pay off their debts within the specified time, otherwise the allocation of yarn would be temporarily suspended. The deadline has now passed, and many of the notified customers have not yet paid. The company has issued another public notice stating that, starting today, the allocation will be temporarily suspended for those who have not paid. Among these customers, 5 belong to Factory No. 12, 4 belong to Factory No. 17, and 10 belong to Factory No. 2.

The cotton cloth market situation yesterday was that, after the chairman of the industry association advocated selling off, many others followed suit, and trading in the market became even more lively. Most long positions were closed, and many in the industry also sold off. Northern merchants, such as Tongyuan Yong, also came to resell, and the supply became smooth. The buyers were all storehouses, such as Xinda Xiang and Xie Da Xiang, who took the opportunity to absorb supplies to meet market sales. After Longtou fine cloth opened at 29 yuan and 4 jiao, Yongxin Company came to sell off again, causing the price of Longtou fine cloth to fall by another jiao to 29 yuan and 3 jiao. There were many trades at the limited price for other cloths such as Wufu, Laba Tong, Yanghe, and fine cloth.

Also, news: The Fangjian Company routinely allocated 14 kinds of fabrics, including Wufu B fine cloth, Taoyuan Tu fine cloth, Wanshan bleached cloth, Yuan Biji, and bed sheets. The demand was greater for Wufu B fine cloth.

Zhongfang Cotton Yarn Transported to Shenyang for Sale

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] The Northeast Branch of Zhongfang transported 200 bales of cotton yarn from Jinzhou to Shenyang by air yesterday. A total of 1,600 bales will be transported in succession. A portion will be sold off to the market to stabilize yarn prices. The Jinzhou Branch of Zhongfang has 60,000 spindles, but due to insufficient electricity and raw materials, only 10,000 spindles are operating, producing 15 bales of cotton yarn per day.

### Money Market Stable; Exchange Rates in Guangzhou and Xiamen Raised Again

The money market yesterday still showed stability. There was a large flow of idle capital southward, and the market needed more orders. However, because there were few trades in the market, and industrial and commercial orders were scarce, the underground interest rate fell by about one jiao. Although the national banks continued to inject money, bank deposits increased, and there was no sign of tightness in the money market. Also, news: The flow of idle capital to the south has become even more turbulent in recent days. Commercial banks in this city have raised the exchange rates for Guangzhou and Xiamen again, charging about 80 yuan or more per 1,000 yuan. Gold Yuan notes with a face value of 50 yuan have been issued since yesterday, and gangs are searching and confiscating them to transport them south in order to avoid the authorities' attention and save on exchange fees.

Seeing that the outflow of idle capital to the south was intensifying, the government decided to restore restrictions on remittances. The Ministry of Finance is currently deliberating on the permissible amount of Gold Yuan notes that can be freely transported domestically, and the announcement is pending.

### Export Tea Stable and Popular

[Our Correspondent] According to an authoritative figure in tea exports, after our government reformed the currency system, the Export Control Committee announced the minimum FOB (Free on Board, Shanghai) price for export materials. Therefore, most export materials are gradually gaining momentum in the international market, and exporters are pleased. The tea industry, in particular, is becoming more promising. Unfortunately, due to the exhaustion of production stocks and the sharp increase in production prices, trading in Japanese and Western tea markets is very scarce, but the underlying trend is quite stable and popular. As for domestic sales, various floral varieties have their ups and downs, and the process has not seen significant fluctuations.

It is also learned that this year's Keemun black tea is being continuously shipped in batches by the Anhui Tea Company, totaling 314 boxes. It is said that they plan to distribute samples for sale soon.

### Chaotic Price Quotations for Woolen Fabrics

In recent days, the prices of woolen fabrics have suddenly become erratic. On the surface, wholesale and retail prices are the same, and retail sales are only for a few social interactions, and wholesale business has decreased. In reality, however, wholesale prices at tea parties are higher than retail prices, and the factory price quotations are higher than the prices quoted in the market. The Zhongfang price quotations have remained unchanged at the limited price, so the market prices have not been able to rise above the level. However, various goods such as flannel, Biji, and overcoating, which are in season, are mostly unavailable, resulting in chaotic price quotations. When Zhongfang woolen fabrics were available, the difference between the market price and the retail price was only about 5 jiao. Currently, because they are not available, the difference has risen to between 2 and 3 yuan.

Imported Paper Arrives in Shanghai

### Quiet Trading Due to Rain; Rice Prices Continue to Decline; Market in Shantou Tentative and Scarce Trading

The rice market is sluggish. Due to heavy rain, there were few pedestrians on the market, resulting in very quiet trading. Because households have already received their rationed rice, there were very few who came to the market to buy more, and there was no active outlet. The opening prices were the same as the previous day, but the market saw a decline due to poor sales, although most prices remained at the original price from the previous day. Indica rice saw a slight drop of 4 or 5 jiao. High-quality rough indica rice, including bags, was 16 yuan, and Jiaxing new rough indica rice was 15 yuan and 5 jiao, a decrease of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Yesterday's arrivals were 2,259 shi in the South Market and 1,912 shi in the North Market.

Flour

Turned firm and high. The prices of various flours increased slightly yesterday. Because the delivery period for warehouse receipts has expired, there are fewer sellers. In addition, the factories have not offered any goods for several days, so the market has turned firm. However, there was very little trading, and actual sales were not large. The price of Bingshen flour was only 7 yuan, 2 jiao, 4 fen, and 1 li, an increase of 1 jiao and 1 fen compared to the previous day. The price of Lao Che flour rose slightly by 5 fen, and the sale was slow. The price of Hongfeng rose by 5 fen, and the price of Jiancheng rose by 9 fen. Other miscellaneous brands of flour also saw a slight increase. Wheat bran remained at the limited price.

Miscellaneous Grains

The market was stable, and trading gradually increased. Soybean oil factories purchased a lot of vehicle beans and Zha beans, and the price remained at the limited price. Northern merchants purchased corn as usual, and supply and demand were both high, so the market was also stable. Red sorghum rose by 2 jiao, and there was an outlet for buyers. Broad beans were average. Dried beans were in short supply and were not offered for sale. The price of Yuanmai was similar to the previous day, but there was very little trading. Sesame was offered at the limited price. Raw peanuts had an outlet in the interior. Dawan Kou raw peanuts were 33 yuan, and many were offered for sale.

Cooking Oil

The market was tentative, and trading was very quiet yesterday, with almost no price fluctuations. Datong Factory and other factories offered soybean oil, and the price was 49 yuan and 7 jiao. Spot goods were all within 50 yuan. The price of Tongfeng soybean oil was 49 yuan, and the market was said to be stable. The price of raw oil remained at the limit. 40 to 50 barrels of pure raw oil were offered at a price of 59.90 yuan. There was no trading in Jitong small cars, and sesame oil in old-barrel small cars was offered at the limited price of 52 yuan and 5 jiao. Rapeseed oil alone saw an increase of 5 jiao, opening at 46 yuan. The sale of soybean cake to buyers was quiet. The factory price was mostly 4 yuan and 6 jiao, and bulk cargo was 2 fen lower.

### Timber Price Limits Approved

The timber price limits have been formally approved by the competent authority of the association. Starting yesterday, the price list will be distributed to the industry for compliance.

Small cedar strips are 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 3 li, and pine slices are 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 7 li. The rest are mostly similar to the prices offered in the previous few days. Only pine planks sawn square are 4 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen per zhang, and tanhu planks are 2 yuan and 5 jiao, both of which are ordinary goods. The price limits for Hongxing and Shuangqian brands are higher, at 5 yuan and 2 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 fen, respectively. Also, yesterday large cedar strips were at the limited price of 1 jiao and 3 fen.

### Cigarette and Soap Market Declines

Various cigarette manufacturers, such as Dadongnan, Huamei, and Huaming, have universally distributed goods to large and small peers in Shanghai. At the same time, Yongtaihe notified a large number of A, B, and C peers in the port to distribute goods, so the money market in the industry is gradually tightening. Many cigarettes are being sold at the limit price.

China Xiangmao Company also distributed a huge amount of soap. After hearing the news, the peers and retail scattered sell off, and each soap fell to limit prices. Gu Ben soap sells 26 yuan and 5 jiao, Xiangmao soap sold for 20 yuan, zero jiao, and 3 fen.

### Wuxi Autumn Cocoons Scarce and Expensive

This year's Wuxi autumn cocoons are very few. Silkworm farmers are asking for 18 shi of rice in exchange for one dan of dry cocoons. According to the local rice price of 18 yuan per shi, each dan of dry cocoons requires 324 Gold Yuan.

### Solving the Coal Shortage in the Beijing-Shanghai Area; Fuel Management Committee Plans to Increase Coal Sources; Estimated Monthly Increase to 270,000 Tons

In order to cooperate with the economic emergency decree, the Fuel Management Committee has formulated a plan for the supply of coal in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The most important aspect of the plan is how to increase coal sources. The committee has formulated six measures:

(1) Assist in restoring the double track of the Tangyu section of the Beining Railway, (2) Prepare to transfer Luan coal through the new port of Tanggu (3) Encourage the export of Taiwan coal, (4) Enhance the transportation capacity of the Jinpu Railway, (5) Solve the difficulties of coal ships, (6) Reward manufacturers for transporting bituminous coal themselves.

It is estimated that the above measures can increase the coal source by 270,000 tons per month. Of these, 100,000 tons are from the Huadong and Huainan mines, 50,000 tons are from Taiwan, and 120,000 tons are from Kailuan. The Beijing-Shanghai area is allocated 220,000 tons per month, leaving 50,000 tons in reserve. The current coal situation is difficult, but it will be overcome soon. The committee is about to end, and a new institution is being prepared. It has been named the Bituminous Coal Adjustment and Supply Office and is responsible for the supply of coal in the Beijing-Shanghai area.

Also, news: Another ship of foreign coal (white coal) will be imported. The ship is the "Lingyun," which belongs to the China Shipping Company, and it is carrying 7,452 tons of white coal from Hong Ji, Vietnam. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th of this month to supply the market. The quantity of coal briquettes to be allocated and sold in Shanghai in September will be more than sufficient. Also, the Tai'an and Dasheng ships, carrying 11,000 tons of beach coal from Qinhuangdao, will arrive in Shanghai on the 3rd.

### Representatives of the Beijing Professors' Association Go to Various Yuan and Departments to Request Adjustments to Public Education Compensation, Personally Delivering Written Opinions and Presenting Three Requests

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Representatives from the Professors' Associations of various national colleges and universities in the capital, in order to request adjustments to the compensation of public education personnel nationwide and academic research subsidies for professors, visited the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Ministry of Education, and the Tenth Planning Department, Ministry of Finance, and other agencies on the 6th and 7th, personally delivering written opinions. The heads of various Yuan and Departments received them and expressed sympathy for the requests of the representatives of the professors' associations of various schools, promising to consider them. The said written opinion is as follows: "The government's reform of the currency system is intended to restore the currency value and prices to pre-war levels, a noble intention. However, according to the government's newly promulgated measures for the payment of public education personnel, the salary conversion is far from the actual price level. Numerically, the ratio is approximately one to ten. It will be increasingly difficult for colleagues to maintain their livelihoods hereafter, and it is difficult to remain silent on this matter. Therefore, representatives of the professors' associations of various national colleges and universities in the capital convened a joint meeting. Based on the various principles of the government's recently promulgated Emergency Financial and Economic Measures and taking into account the actual living needs of public education personnel, three points were decided: (Omitted in the middle, details were on page 7 of this newspaper on September 1st.) The proposals are not extravagant, and in light of the circumstances, they are fair and practical. We sincerely hope that the government will adopt them to comfort the public."

### American Military Baseball League: China Declines Sharply; Women's Softball League: Lantern Falls to Second Place

[Our Report] The nation's hopes for running and hitting in baseball have vanished with the scattering of China's athletes and the repeated defeats of Lantern. Most of China's veterans are tired and have been replaced by new Panda blood. Their ball skills and experience are inevitably inferior. Therefore, in the second American Naval Baseball League, they have repeatedly lost and no longer have the strength to seriously threaten the Air Force, the champion team of the first season. The second league has entered the second cycle. The Air Force, with the reputation of the defending champion, sits atop the league with seven wins and one loss in eight games. Helena is second with four wins and two losses. Amateur is third with five wins and three losses. China has made six expeditions to Qishan and only won once, ranking seventh. Now that the summer vacation has passed and the schools are about to start, the Panda athletes are mostly young students, and it will be even more difficult to concentrate on this field. The seat in the yellow bag is not easy to break free. Here is the latest situation in the second baseball league:

Team Name Games Wins Losses Percentage

Air Force 8 7 1 .857

Helena 6 4 2 .667

Amateur 8 5 3 .625

Nanjing 12 6 6 .500

Army 10 5 5 .500

Navy 12 2 8 .200

China 6 1 5 .167

In the Women's Softball League organized by the International Sports Association, Lantern was unfortunately defeated by the Education Federation by one point in the first cycle. Then, due to a moment of underestimation, it was swallowed by the Raccoon. The hope of avenging in the second cycle and sharing the championship with the Education Federation was also lost. As a result, morale declined, and when they met the Education Federation again, they were completely defeated. Now the Education Federation has gloriously ascended to the throne with a record of 16 consecutive victories. Lantern still has several makeup games, and the second place should not be a problem. In addition, in order to celebrate the successful conclusion of various ball games, the International Sports Association has arranged several closing performance matches, with the "Wives," "Misses," and "Students" teams participating in the competition. This Sunday afternoon at 4 pm, the "Misses" will face off against the "Students."

### Public Tennis Tournament: Matches Suspended Today and Tomorrow

Resuming on Friday

The incessant autumn rain has again interrupted the public tennis tournament, causing the matches to be unable to proceed in order, which has greatly affected the efficiency and competitive spirit. Moreover, after the heavy rain, the red and yellow sand on the court has been washed away and needs to be tidied up. The Tennis Committee Office stated that matches will be suspended today and tomorrow, regardless of the weather. If the weather clears up immediately, the matches will resume from Friday (10th), and the schedule will be rearranged and announced.

According to the person in charge of the office, the weather was sunny and warm during the first week of the public tournament, and the matches proceeded smoothly. Since then, there have been continuous heavy rains, which have prevented the scheduled plan from being completed. The Tennis Committee, in view of the completion of the Youth Tennis Association, which has established a relatively perfect ball court, and in order to increase the interest of the tennis community in the city and achieve the effect of popularizing progress, has specially held all the matches of the public tournament at the association's ball court. The committee does not hesitate to sacrifice and provide all the balls for the matches. The budget for the expenses when the public tournament started registration was 5 billion yuan in legal tender, but according to the estimate when the currency system was reformed on August 19, it will require 7.5 billion, equivalent to 2,500 gold yuan. This is due to the sharp increase in the index in the first half of August. The committee has obviously encountered major difficulties, but it is determined to overcome them.

### Yingxiutang Cricket Fighting

— Chen Yixian

Today is the White Dew Festival, and the annual cricket fighting season has arrived again. People in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces who enjoy playing with autumn insects regard it as a major event. There are experts who raise them, and famous masters who hold the grass. After the White Dew Festival, the autumn season (gambling term) begins. Famous towns and cities along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines hold them in stages. The final victor is called the Invincible General. Among my friends, some enjoy this way, and I occasionally admire their insects, but I have not participated in their fights.

Before the Republic, when I was studying in the old capital, I once participated in a cricket fighting event at Yingxiutang with my brother and friends. Yingxiutang was located at No. 1 Dawailangying, outside Qianmen in the old capital, and was the residence of Tan Xinpei, the king of the opera world. Several of us were Tan (Tan) fans, and Lao Tan was also from Hubei. Because of our shared hometown and hobbies, we often visited his insect gatherings every autumn. On the day of the Yingxiutang cricket fight, those who brought insects included nobles, officials, merchants, and various opera performers. The insects must be matched in pairs, with each gram and ounce exactly the same, before they can enter the enclosure. The person in charge of this task was an old man (i.e., a eunuch), who used the scales used in silver shops to weigh each insect's weight. It had to be extremely even without the slightest difference, and then they were divided and opened. Xinpei often came out of the inner house to watch when the two insects were about to enter the basin.

One day, Xinpei obtained a "Guangyi" (a type of cricket) and happily showed it to us. On that day, the place to sell crickets in the old capital was in the shops outside Shunzhimen (i.e., Xuanwumen). A small basket of crickets, about dozens of heads, could be bought for two taels of silver, and there were often excellent ones among them. My history and brother bought a basket at Wanshun Old Store and carefully selected it. Among them was a "Guangyi" with a large head and long feet, which seemed to be an English material. We discussed with Xinpei to choose a day to try fighting it, not inviting many people. Those who came on time, besides the Yingxiutang family, only included my brothers and friends, about a dozen people in total. The old man weighed the "Guangyi" weight, and Tan's insect was about a li weaker than my brother's. Wei Pei asked what to do? My brother was not interested in flowers (flowers are the name of the bets placed on both sides during insect fighting), but only wanted to enjoy the insect's struggle to get a laugh. Therefore, although the weight of the B insect was slightly lighter than Tan's insect, he was still willing to put it in the basin to see what would happen. After opening the machine, the grass holder slightly moved it, and the long beards of the two insects touched each other. They immediately pounced forward, their teeth biting each other, fighting fiercely, and the scene was extremely tragic. My brother's insect suddenly changed its strategy and bit its enemy's leg. Xinpei watched from the sidelines and shouted, "It bit my thigh!" The viewers all laughed. In a blink of an eye, the victory or defeat was decided. My brother's insect crowed loudly, its voice clear and melodious, and Tan's insect retreated and fled.

There was also a ridiculous thing this time. Yang Shiqi, the brother of Yang Shixiang, the Beiyang Minister and Governor-General of Zhili, was among those who came to watch that day. When the two "Guangyi" were fighting fiercely, he concentrated his attention, looked down at the fighting basin, and rested his hands on the edge of the table. My younger brother Nongxian was beside him, also looking down. Suddenly, a thick stream of nasal mucus fell on Shiqi's back. Shiqi was watching the insect fight and did not pay attention to it, showing a noble tolerance, which was admirable and laughable.

### Two "Calligrapher Wangs"

— You Mojun

Although it is already autumn, small fans have not yet been discarded. When friends meet, they often look at each other's fans; either criticizing the writing as good, or criticizing the painting as not good. This has become commonplace.

That day, Friend A invited me to visit Friend B together. While they were talking vigorously, I took Friend A's fan to take a look. It was all made by daytime artisans. The writing was not bad, but upon closer inspection, I saw that it was written:

"The Calligrapher Wang's brushwork can melt 'govern' (originally written like this) the various Yan and Liu masters, so the goodness of his calligraphy is truly difficult for the ancients to match! And Wen Min's rise hundreds of years later and ability to obtain his spirit is truly difficult to find in the area, so his brushwork..."

The rest of the text is unknown. The signature is in the name of someone from Suzhou. Because this is a rare and wonderful article to read, it must be recorded, but unfortunately the tone is incomplete!

The next day, Friend A invited us for a small drink at his residence. I met Friend B and took his fan to look at. I won't talk about the writing, the painting was "Ten Thousand Bamboos in Misty Rain," but the bamboos didn't look like bamboos but like a belt. Upon another look at the inscription, it was written:

"In the style (originally written like this) of the Calligrapher Wang to dedicate to Mr. ××!"

The signature is Seventy-two Old ××. This is another wonderful article that must be recorded.

What I saw in two days can be called amazing. After the wine, I laughed and advised them to combine the two pieces of writing and painting to form a pair of gems, becoming "Two Calligrapher Wangs"! They didn't understand. After I explained it, they also laughed.

### Spring View of Beihu Lake

— Xu Chengyu

Where is the scenery most pitiful? The spring in Beihu is soft, and the waves are like smoke. Tourists invite dreams outside the slanting sun, and maids search for songs beside short boats. The flower clouds in the distance are all affectionate, and the flying willow mist is always graceful. Even more affectionate are the red flowers, the same fragrance reaching the silken banquet.

The beautiful silken banquet is reopened, and the spring water and spring mountains are embroidered into a pile. The beautiful scenery is just beginning to dazzle, and the shocking war flames make me hesitate to linger. Swallows carrying mud plan to nest in jeweled trees, and ants carrying soil compete to embrace giant locusts. I only beg for steady feet to soar into the sky, and a short stay by the flowers is like Penglai.

### Signing and Stamping

— Lao Dan

Now there are many documents, such as guarantees, or some forms to be filled out, which state that the filler must "sign and stamp." This kind of custom has not been popular for very long. If you think that anyone can stamp the official seal, and it is even easy to fake, so you must sign it yourself as proof, then why do you need to stamp it after signing? In other words, it proves that both signing and stamping are unreliable. Otherwise, if you have already signed, why bother stamping? If you have already stamped, signing is redundant. "Signing and stamping" is like a joke of stacking beds on top of each other.

Originally, in the past, those who worked in government offices, whether drafting, reviewing, coordinating, or approving documents, all stamped. Later, some people felt that there were many abuses in stamping, so they switched to signing. Naturally, signing is more practical and accurate than stamping. Because in the past, many responsible officials did not review official business themselves, and the secretaries-general (directors) were also mostly empty names. The official business in the agencies was mostly reviewed and approved by a secretary, and after this secretary had read a piece of official business, he would immediately stamp the official seal of the responsible official, the secretary-general, and others, and sometimes he would also stamp the official seal of the deputy director, etc. Therefore, some people said that China's administration was "seal politics."

Some responsible officials prepared several name seals: one for themselves, one for the accompanying (confidential) secretary, one for the reviewing secretary, one for the seal-printing office, and one for the official residence. If he had concurrent positions, then each concurrent agency and organization would have one for standby. Because office work only recognizes the seal and not the person, some people have more than ten concurrent positions, or even concurrent positions in provinces far apart. There is no other reason; this is relying on the seal to represent him.

Foreigners in China's banks, post offices, etc., can receive remittances or checks as long as they sign the form, or at most show their passport. However, Chinese people who receive payments from banks, money shops, post offices, etc., must not only sign but also stamp, and must also have a shop guarantee or bank guarantee before payment is allowed. "No guarantee, no payment" is engraved with a fixed seal and placed on the remittance note. I don't know who came up with this trick, which makes it very difficult for the payee. Sometimes some people can't find a shop guarantee, show their identity, and still can't get the money. In recent years, the postal remittances have specified "signature or stamp" in the payee column, which is a convenient method and truly a great merit.

Perhaps some people say that signatures are easy to forge, so you must stamp again. In fact, what is easy to forge is the seal, not the signature. This is something that anyone who has a little knowledge of calligraphy can understand. However, the world is full of people blindly following the seal as the basis of credit and ignoring the individual's signature; even more, they want to use both the signature and the seal, which is truly unthinkable.

### Paper and Brush

— Yi Yun

History says that during the reign of Emperor He of the Han Dynasty, the eunuch Cai Lun used tree bark and hemp heads to make paper, so now everyone says that it was created by Cai Lun. In the shrines dedicated to the ancestral masters of various industries, there is a statue of Cai Lun, a handsome young man dressed like a young master in a drama, I do not know the source. But according to the Biography of Empress Zhao in the History of Ban, there is a "scarlet", and the Records of the Western Capital calls it "thin hoof", with a note saying that it is small paper; and the Stories of the Three Assistants says that the crown prince used paper to block his nose; all of which were before Emperor He of the Han Dynasty, so it can be known that paper did not originate with Cai Lun. Perhaps Cai Lun only began to refine the processing, so later generations only called him by that name.

Brushes did not originate with Meng Tian, as the ancients have said. Li Shi's Continued Record of Diverse Things says: Wang Shu has said: Since the beginning of writing, there should have been brushes. It is said that it began with Meng Tian, which is probably not true. According to Taigong, "The hairs are luxuriant, they can be removed from the water, and the writing will not come alive." Also, when Confucius wrote the Classic of Filial Piety, he wore a hairpin, a blue brush, and a 单衣, facing north and bowing, which shows that the origin of the brush is long ago. If it is said that at that time it was carved with a knife as a brush, then Taigong's words of "luxuriant hairs" seem to clearly refer to a writing brush. The Brush Classic says: Tian used deer hair as a column and sheep hair as a covering, which proves that the brush was made more skillfully by Meng Tian, but it was not created by Tian. Only rabbit hair was not mentioned. Han Changli's Biography of Mao Ying says that Meng Tian went to Zhongshan to pull out his hairs, etc., which is probably a playful text that has not been deeply considered. It was not until the Calligrapher Wang's Brush Classic that it was said that the rabbits in Zhongshan were fat and had long hairs, which seems to be the beginning of rabbit hair. The Qing people always valued purple hair when writing regular script, because purple hair is firm and sharp, making the writing more vigorous and organized, especially for those who need to excel in calligraphy in the imperial examinations, such as superior tributes, selected tributes, and进士殿试, then purple hair is almost indispensable. Calligraphers such as Li Meian and Zeng Nongran all used purple hair exclusively, even when the characters were more than a foot large. (Liu Shannong said that his writing was not as good as Zeng Li's because he could not use purple hair to write large characters.) It is also said that Liu Shian used purple hair exclusively throughout his life, but the value of large brushes with purple hair is several times that of sheep hair, because this hair has fewer long tips and is also more difficult to split and make.

### Do It When You Think of It

— Xi

The manager of a certain company in the United States felt that the employees in the store had the problem of hesitation and indecision, and wanted to correct this trend, so he posted slogans everywhere in the store, and the slogans were the four characters "Do it when you think of it."

Soon, the slogan had an unexpected effect!

Their chief accountant embezzled $20,000 of public funds and ran away; an accountant and his beautiful female secretary eloped quietly; twelve clerks jointly demanded a raise; and a tea boy in the writing room ran to Hollywood to become a movie star. (Translated from "Crown")

### Historical Figures: Shi, Wang, Xue

— Gongsun Wu

Someone asked, "What is the story of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* about?" I replied, "I once discussed it before, but my thoughts were not fully expressed, and my research was also incomplete." I believe that since the Jia household is a noble family, it is a miniature of the imperial family. It is not wrong to view it as a court drama. The Jia family's series of events are the common historical occurrences involving relatives of the emperor and empresses. Therefore, *Dream of the Red Chamber* is also a political novel. Grandmother Jia is not significantly flawed, and her nature is kind and generous. However, she is old, senile, and only indulges in pleasure, allowing Wang Xifeng to wield power. Her son, Zheng, is mediocre and incompetent, becoming foolishly filial. The Jia family's near downfall is Grandmother's fault. After Grandmother passes, Wang Furen will succeed her. Wang appears to be kind and benevolent but is actually very harsh. Her treatment of Jin Chuan and Qing Wen is lamentable. Xifeng and Xiren are both Wang's party, and she further introduces Aunt Xue to strengthen her forces. Xue has great ambitions and first attaches herself to Wang to build her power. Since Zheng is useless, Zhu has already died young, and Lan is a young grandson, Baochai must marry Baoyu for Wang's faction to be established. Daiyu and Xiangyun are no match for her. Xiangyun, at the decline of the Shi family, tried but failed. The golden unicorn incident diminished as soon as it started, proving that the Shi family is not a match for the Wang faction. Yuanyang's suicide for her master shows that she knew she was isolated and would inevitably be humiliated. Lin Meimei repeatedly lamented that she had no one to rely on, only Grandmother's love, which was ultimately unreliable. Even with her jealousy and suspicion, and all her efforts, she could not withstand the conspiracy and became a sacrifice. Even if Baoyu had not disappeared, he might not have been a good family manager. His nature is fickle, and Baochai and Xiren could easily manipulate him. Moreover, since he disappeared, it can be said that Wang and Xue's plan has succeeded. Shi, Wang, and Xue successively controlled the Jia family's affairs. The entire book narrates events consistently, regardless of whether the author is one person or two. I believe their consciousness is such. Baochai still has a child in her womb, with promising prospects. However, Li Wan is biding her time in obscurity. Once Lan grows up, the Jia family might be revived, and the Li family will gain power. It is unknown at that time who will win between the Li and Xue families. If I were to write a sequel, I would focus on this.

### Jiang Jianxia's Book Collection

— Qian Dacheng

In the first month of Yiyou year, I obtained Jiang Jianxia's old collection of *Jingji Fanggu Zhi* in eight volumes from a bookstore on Hulong Street in Suzhou for 800 yuan in counterfeit currency. The cover has Jianxia's handwritten inscription, which reads: "Jingji Fanggu Zhi, six juan, with a supplement of one juan, in eight volumes. In the second month of Guangxu Ji Chou year, gifted by Zhuzi Han Zhizhong. Jianxia, recorded." Below is a seal with the characters "Jianxia." In the book, the line formats of each recorded book are circled in red ink, presumably to compile a "Table of Line Formats of Song and Yuan Editions." There are also one or twenty annotations, mentioning that after Jingzhou Chen Hengshan (a licentiate) obtained a Song edition of *Zhong Shuo*, he immediately pasted it onto a board and re-engraved it. Hengshan also obtained a Northern Song edition of *Two Lis' Collection of Matching Poems*. After making a Jing edition, he gifted the original book to Chuan Mouyuan (Yunlong). These are all anecdotes from the book world, which can be used as talking points. To paste a Song edition onto a board and re-engrave it would be a great aesthetic crime.

Jianxia's given name was Biao; his courtesy name was Xuan , and another name was Yun , Shi , a native of Qing Yuanhe, and an indoor disciple of Ye Lishang. He once served as the academic commissioner of Hunan. In Guangxu Wuxu year, he was ordered to work in the Zongli Yamen (Foreign Office). After Kang and Liang's failure, he was dismissed and lived in seclusion on the sea, indulging in fine wine and women, and died within a year. "Hai Hua" also mentions him, using "Jiang Jianyun" to allude to his name, a handsome young man with an unconventional and extraordinary character.

Jianxia's book collection was quite rich, and he also engraved many books. While in Changsha, he commissioned Vice Minister Wu Xianzai to paint "Xiushu Gang" (Hill of Book Repair). Jianxia himself stated, "I have no fondness for dogs, horses, silk, bamboo, nor can I drink. I only spend my days close to books and history... I collected and engraved manuscripts of predecessors and contemporaries, compiling several volumes of Yunzhai Ge Series of Books. He also obtained Chen Si's edition of *Tang Ren Xiao Ji* (Minor Collections of Tang Poets) in forty-nine families, engraved in the Southern Song Dynasty, and paid for it to be reprinted without losing a hair... The printing of Tang Ren Xiao Ji is extremely fine. Several copies were printed with leather paper. A bookstore in Suzhou once used a damaged copy of this book, dyed it, and pretended it was a Song edition to deceive Mr. Wu Qu'an. He only discovered the deception after purchasing it for several days, which shows how exquisite the book is." Scores of prominent figures of the time wrote poems of praise on the “Xiushu Gang,” Liang Rengong (Liang Qichao) wrote “Tens of thousands of scholars are only chattering insects following others, and one or two people at most understand. This comes from the East and the West. There are Qian Yanliao of Boyang in the past, and there are the horizontal words of Yuanhe today. Take all the book lists of the world, like looking for stones in the imperial library.” Tan Fusheng (Tan Sitong) also wrote a poem that says, “Those who rush to patch things up in Lu are misguided to the old nest for all birds. The public doesn’t mind spoiling the scenery, and immediately pays for it to be burned by the founding emperor.” “Even if the spiritual roots are cut off, there will be leftovers. Repentance in the next life will be in vain. The boring shells mix together. The body is already disgusted, let alone books!” Liang and Tan, who were leaders of the reform movement, talked eloquently, and Fusheng's words were particularly forthright, reflecting his personality. Learning increases daily, as the Old Master said. Abandoning all poetry and books is the only way to enter the Tao. Wu Zhilao's words about burning all thread-bound books were not thorough enough. Around the Wuxu Reform, the opinions of prominent figures of the time were like this. Jianxia was also called a member of the "Reform Party" at the time.

Jianxia also wrote many books, including *Table of Line Formats of Song and Yuan Editions* and *Huang Yuji Nian Du*, which involved scholars of daily records and editions. He was also able to paint, and was particularly skilled in flowers.

Jianxia was eager to serve the world, but after a brief venture, he returned defeated. In the end, he became famous as a book collector. Was this Jianxia's misfortune? Ye Jushang expressed deep sorrow for Jianxia’s death. (Ye Jushang's six-volume edition of *Shuji Jishi Shi* (Poems Recording Book Events) was engraved by Jianxia. The seven-volume edition was engraved by Ye's family, and Jianxia had already passed away, so there is a poem about it.)
