### The Suppression War Has Entered a New Phase: National Army Forces from Eastern Henan and Xuzhou Converge; Elite Troops Advance in Two Routes towards Suxian

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] National Army forces advancing westward from Nianzhuang on the eastern front of Xuzhou converged with the eastward-bound forces at Daxujia this afternoon. The first to shake hands with Commanders Qiu and Li was Chen Zhang, commander of the 25th Army, the main force in the Nianzhuang battle, who was responsible for the northern defense and served as the vanguard in this westward advance.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 24th] The three corps of Huang, Qiu, and Li on the eastern front have converged, and the National Army's suppression war has entered a new phase. Currently, in addition to clearing out the remnants of bandits in the area north and south of the railway between Nianzhuang and Daxujia, the National Army continues to pursue and attack the main force of the bandit remnants fleeing towards Suining and Shuanggou. The focus of the suppression war has shifted from the eastern front to the southeastern region.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The pursuit on the eastern front of the Xuzhou campaign is nearing its end, while the pursuit on the southern route is just beginning. The Xuzhou Suppression Command announced that over 100,000 troops from the bandit Chen's 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and New 7th Columns have suffered heavy losses after being relentlessly pursued and severely attacked by the National Army on the eastern front of Xuzhou in recent days. The remnants fled north in panic across the Bulao River on the 23rd, while those who did not cross the Bulao River fled south towards the Sui River. Another part of the bandit Chen's 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and the two Guangdong Columns have launched several fierce attacks on our southern route of Xuzhou in recent days, but all failed, resulting in heavy casualties and demoralization. They are now fleeing southwest towards Suxian, and we are pursuing them fiercely while taking advantage of our victory.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The National Army on the eastern front of Xuzhou, with an indomitable spirit, captured Daxujia this time, creating an unprecedented glorious record in the eastern front pursuit war. The bandits, with Daxujia as the center, set up a rectangular阵地 (阵地) with a depth of sixty *huali* from east to west and a frontage of about thirty *huali* from north to south, building fortresses based on villages, seizing mountains as camps, defending every step to the death, and stubbornly resisting at every turn, attempting to prevent our main army from advancing eastward. Commanders Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi of the two corps personally directed their subordinates to bravely attack from the front lines. Division Commander Tan Xin personally led his troops to capture Daxujia, which was fortified with strong reinforced concrete fortifications. His bravery and sacrifice are particularly admirable. The bandits who stubbornly resisted on this line suffered heavy casualties. Taking the 7th Column as an example, the 58th Regiment of its 20th Division and the 61st and 63rd Regiments of its 21st Division have been confirmed to be completely annihilated.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 24th] The National Army's Huang Wei and Li Yannian corps continue to advance north from the eastern and western areas of Suxian, gradually extending two pincers towards the northeast and northwest directions of Suxian.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The Xuzhou-based air force, with powerful formations, took turns bombing the bandits who had invaded the outskirts of Lingbi City in northern Anhui this morning, killing and wounding over a thousand bandits in the southeast, west, and east suburbs. Another group of aircraft discovered another bandit force operating within 20 kilometers north and northwest of Lingbi and continuously and fiercely bombarded them. The bandit unit suffered heavy casualties, with over two thousand bodies witnessed by the air force alone.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The area around Huangkou, Yanglou, and Haozhai on the western front of Xuzhou is still under the control of the National Army. During the initial battles of the Xuzhou campaign, the bandits once invaded but were repelled. Since then, they have been confronting the National Army west of Huangkou. Yesterday morning, the bandit field旅 (旅) again attempted to invade the Zhangji area of Huangkou, but were defeated and retreated after a day of fierce fighting. In addition, Jiawang and Xin Mining (area) northeast of Xuzhou have been recovered by the National Army.

### Eastern Hebei Remains Cloudy and Rainless; No Major Engagement in the Suburbs of Taiyuan; Air Force Exerts Power; National Army in Suiyuan Expands and Enters Tuoxian

[Our Newspaper, Tangshan, 24th] The general situation in eastern Hebei is like overcast weather, with rumbles of thunder suggesting a bloody storm is approaching. However, after the battle in western Liaoning, the Communist bandits have not recovered their vitality and need to reorganize. In order to reverse the situation and defend North China, both sides are cautious about future engagements and dare not act rashly. Currently, the bandits in Sanhe and Xianghe are being compressed by the National Army and are moving eastward. The bandits entrenched in Wangtian, Fengrun, are only carrying out localized raids. After the National Army searches for these two remnant bandit forces, will they engage in widespread contact with the National Army or disintegrate and flee? It is impossible to predict. However, will the overcast weather temporarily reveal sunlight or pour down with torrential rain? It may be revealed in the near future.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] The National Army east of Beiping is sweeping the area east of the Jian'gan River on both the north and south wings, making smooth progress. Another unit of the National Army is launching attacks north from Tianjin, strengthening the pressure on the bandits on the southern wing. (2) Over five hundred bandits were discovered in the Daxiao Tangshan area, 20 *li* southeast of Changping, on the morning of the 23rd. They were severely attacked by the mobile suppression National Army for an hour, with fifty bandits killed or wounded. The bandits fled northwest.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th] From the evening of the 23rd to the morning of the 24th, there was still no major engagement in the suburbs of Taiyuan. Only the bandits facing our positions in Heituo Zao Yuan and other places southeast of the city launched small-scale harassment attacks on our positions at midnight on the 23rd. After being severely attacked by the defending troops in separate actions, they retreated with injuries. Today, after the rain cleared, our Iron Wing units flew over in batches all day long, continuing to carry out powerful bombing and strafing operations against the bandits in the suburbs, achieving brilliant results. The bandit positions and lurking bandits in the mountainous areas southeast to northeast of the city were bombed and strafed by our aircraft and suffered heavy losses. The bandit artillery, which had been lurking in Niutuo Village for many days and firing at our airfield, was also discovered by our aircraft and completely destroyed. Beigou Village, north of Mengjiajing, which served as a bandit ammunition depot, was hit by a bomb at noon and immediately exploded and burned down.

### Tao Xisheng's Remarks in Beiping: Authorities Are Considering Wartime System Issues; Will Enlist Talents from Across the Country to Strengthen the Government

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] Tao Xisheng, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, said in Beiping: The President originally intended for Zhang Yuejun to be the new President of the Executive Yuan, but Zhang wanted to devote more effort to international relations and was unwilling to assume a fixed responsibility. He also believed that it would be difficult for old people to achieve much, and hoped that new candidates would be selected to take charge. The Executive Yuan is currently being led by Vice President Zhang Lisheng, but this situation is unlikely to last long. Regarding the issue of a wartime system, meetings are being held in Nanjing every day to consider it. The actual content probably includes two main points: (1) strengthening administrative efficiency; (2) expanding the government's foundation and enlisting talents from all over the country to strengthen the government's ranks. According to Tao, his trip to the north was mainly to see the situation of several schools and to inspect the newspapers and film agencies under the Central Propaganda Department. Tao visited Hu Shi for a long talk on the 22nd and visited Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University, and Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University, in the western suburbs on the 23rd.

[Another Dispatch] Tao Xisheng is scheduled to leave Beiping for Shanghai on the 25th.

### Salaries for Public School and Government Employees Adjusted This Month; Generally Increased Fivefold Compared to Last Month; Measures Passed by the Executive Yuan Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Executive Yuan's political meeting on the 24th passed measures to adjust salaries for civil and military government employees and decided to implement them this month. This adjustment is generally more than five times higher than last month. The proportion of increase is even higher for those with lower base salaries. The calculation method is based on the fourth zone as the standard, with 60 yuan as the base for the base salary, 20% for 61 yuan to 300 yuan, and 10% for more than 301 yuan. The sum is then multiplied by five to get the actual *jinyuan* (金圆) amount. Other zones, in addition to the actual distribution according to the fourth zone standard, will be issued with different proportions of additional issuance. The third zone will receive an additional 20% of the actual amount obtained by the fourth zone, the second zone will receive an additional 45%, the first zone will receive an additional 70%, and the special zone (Taiyuan) will receive an additional 150%. Military personnel will be calculated according to the third zone standard. The adjustment案 (案) of increasing one and a half times approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on November 3 will be abolished. The regional zoning and calculation methods are recorded below:

First Zone: Qingdao, Zhangjiakou, Gui Sui, Dihua, Yulin, Shanxi.

Second Zone: Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou. Jiuquan, Tangshan, Jimo, Qinhuangdao, Xiamen, Lianyungang, Xinjiang, Rehe, Suiyuan, Chahar.

Third Zone: Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Xining, Kangding, Xi'an, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Hefei, Changjiang, Fuzhou, Yinchuan, Wuzhou, Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Gansu, Jiangsu, Zhejiang. Hunan, Hubei, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Ningxia.

Fourth Zone: Guilin, Kunming, Guiyang, Chengdu. Chongqing. Guangxi. Yunnan. Xikang, Sichuan, Guizhou.

Special Zone: Taiyuan.

Calculation Example: The calculation method for the fourth zone is exemplified as follows: For a Level 1 Senior Appointment with a base salary of 680 yuan, it should be 60 yuan plus 48 yuan plus 38 yuan, and then the sum is multiplied by five to get 730 yuan. For a Level 16 Delegated Appointment with a base salary of 55 yuan, it should be 55 yuan multiplied by five to get 275 yuan. For a Level 1 Senior Appointment in the third zone with a base salary of 680 yuan, it should be 60 yuan plus 48 yuan plus 38 yuan, multiplied by five, and then add 20% to get 876 yuan. For a Level 16 Delegated Appointment with a base salary of 55 yuan, it should be 55 yuan multiplied by five, and then add 20% to get 330 yuan.

### National-Run Transportation Businesses Increase Prices Too Much; Control Yuan Decides to Propose a Rectification; Transportation Becomes a Means of Transportation Exclusively for the Wealthy

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Control Yuan has decided to submit a rectification proposal to the Executive Yuan regarding the problem of excessive price increases in national-run transportation businesses. The proposal was approved at the regular meeting of the Transportation Committee of the Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 24th and will be sent out immediately. The reason is: The state sets up transportation agencies to serve the public and facilitate the majority of the people. Now, the fares for aviation and shipping are too expensive, which only turns planes and ships into means of transportation exclusively for the wealthy, while after the government improved management and supplementary measures, the price index this month in Shanghai has risen more than eight times compared to August 19, and seven times eight in Nanjing. However, the shipping fares this month suddenly increased by seventeen and a half times in ten days, and air tickets suddenly increased by nineteen times in one week. The Ministry of Communications actually approved it. This measure is obviously inappropriate. The employees of the various companies and agencies cleverly set up various names and arbitrarily increase allowances and subsidies, which leads to repeated increases in charges but does not make up for the expenses of the business and still requires constant subsidies from the government, which urgently needs to be corrected. "The case was submitted by Supervisors Leng Budong, Sun Shi'an, Ma Yaonan, and Tang Honglie.

The meeting of the Transportation Committee of the Supervisory Yuan today was chaired by Zhang Dinghua, the convener of the committee. In addition to the rectification proposal for the price increase of state-owned enterprises, the following cases were also discussed: (1) The proposal to correct the conflict between the postal personnel management regulations and government laws and regulations was resolved and the Yuan was instructed to correct the responsible agency. (2) Guangdong Chairman Song Ziwen purchased six small airplanes for two people and ordered the counties in Guangdong Province to repair small airfields for inspecting local government affairs. Supervisors Tang Honglie and others believed that this was wasteful and should be stopped. The committee members present elected Tang Honglie, Guo Zhongkui, and E Jingfu to be responsible for drafting the impeachment document.

### Audit System Issues of the China Merchants Bureau and the China Textile Company

According to regulations, if the government's capital accounts for more than 50%, a business budget statement should be prepared and submitted to the accounting agency for filing. Based on this fact, the Audit Department can continue to exercise audit rights over the China Merchants Bureau and the China Textile Company. However, for the sake of prudence, the Executive Yuan decided to review it before responding.

He should be given a clear commendation, and his life's achievements should be submitted to the National History Museum to show the utmost intention of cherishing meritorious officials.

### Calling for More and Faster US Aid to China; Gu Weijun Visits Truman; Truman and Marshall Have Important Discussions

[Our News] Washington, 24th Broadcast: Truman and Marshall discussed the urgent world problems for half an hour, with the China issue being the most urgent. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun will meet with Truman in a few hours. It is expected that Gu will ask Truman to express US support for the Chinese Nationalist Government.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun appealed tonight for the United States to provide more aid to China as quickly as possible to stop the grave threat of communist rule and control. He said that if China were to unfortunately fall under Communist rule, Asia would follow, and the war for freedom, which has a great impact on the United States and other freedom-loving people in the world, would have failed at least halfway. Gu's warning speech was made at the invitation of the 电闻 (电闻) Company, and the newsreel of this speech will be shown in US cinemas. He said that from the Chinese perspective, this kind of American aid can be used effectively. The United States' current assistance to China as quickly as possible is equivalent to maintaining the freedom and democracy that is fully manifested in the American way of life. Gu pointed out that while Europe is currently working to prevent the spread of communism, Asia is suffering severely from communism. Over two million 共匪 (共匪) have now seized the nine northeastern provinces and are attacking various parts of North and Central China. It is also learned that Gu and Chinese military attaché to the United States Pi Zongkan will give a talk on an American television station tomorrow night.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned here today that President Chiang's letter to President Truman had hoped that MacArthur would serve as the head of the US military delegation to China to boost morale in the fight against the 共匪 (共匪). At least Chiang had suggested to Truman that China needed a general to help, and this person must have great prestige. However, it is feared that the appointment of MacArthur as the head of the US military delegation to China has not been seriously considered here. In addition, it is also learned that regardless of the final decision on the issue of large-scale aid to China, US foreign aid expenditures in the coming years will undoubtedly reach tens of billions. Two points are clear in the outline that the US authorities are currently seeing: First, if President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall decide that China can still be saved and provide assistance, they will at least ask the new Congress to approve hundreds of millions of dollars. This is just the beginning. Any new aid to China plan must be a long-term plan, and there will be a steady stream of assistance in the future. Second, assuming that all of China falls under Communist rule, whether or not there is American aid, the cost of rebuilding Japan and stabilizing its economy will be even higher. This is because it will be more difficult for Japan to trade with Communist-ruled China at that time. Furthermore, if Communist-ruled China actively opposes Western countries in the Cold War, the United States will have to strengthen its defenses in the Western Pacific, which will also cost a lot. Truman and Marshall must consider these factors when reviewing China policy. Marshall is scheduled to meet with the President again today, the second time in three days. The problem of comprehensive US aid to China to suppress the Communist must also take into account the movements of the Soviet Union. Some authorities believe that this move has the danger of causing an indirect conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. In addition, the problem of whether Marshall will stay or leave remains to be seen. Marshall is scheduled to hold a press conference at 4:30 AM Shanghai time tomorrow morning, at which time there will be a major announcement.

### Hoffman and Truman Discuss Aid to China Issue

[US Information Service, Washington, 23rd] Economic Cooperation Administration Administrator Hoffman met with President Truman at the White House this afternoon. Afterwards, he told reporters that he had discussed the issue of 总署 (总署) aid to China with the President, but it was "very brief."

### Suggestions Received by US Government and Congress: Send 10,000 US Troops to China; US National Security Council Held Emergency Meeting to Discuss

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Responsible sources stated today that if the United States decides to increase aid to China to reverse the communist suppression campaign, the number of US military advisory group officers and soldiers stationed in China must increase tenfold from the current 1,000 to about 10,000. Their authority should also be expanded from mere training to guiding and supervising actual combat. The government and Congress have both received such suggestions. The National Security Council held an emergency meeting at the White House today, two days earlier than scheduled, which may have discussed this. However, increasing the number of US military advisory group personnel in China to 10,000 is contingent on President Chiang being able to accept US aid to Greece-style conditions. According to military experts here, if this measure is implemented, it could halt the communist advance within a few months. Strictly from a military perspective, the US military aid plan to China should include: (1) dispatching US officers and soldiers as advisors to the National Army combat corps; (2) organizing a flexible logistics force to facilitate supply and establishing more casualty hospitals; and (3) intensifying propaganda efforts to make the purpose of US aid widely known and boost morale. This initiative would last for several years and require US$5 billion in funding. Economic expenses are not included. This year, US military aid to China is only US$125 million.

### Thorough Reform! Seeking Assistance Openly! - May the Government and Allied Nations Value the Appeals of Shanghai Citizens

Representatives from Shanghai's industrial, commercial, educational, and other sectors went to the capital the day before yesterday to present their views on the current situation to the President, expressing their support for the government's suppression of the rebellion and hoping for reforms in political, economic, and diplomatic fields. They also visited Ambassador Stuart, telegraphed the US President and Secretary of State, appealing for timely and increased aid to China. Yesterday, they also expressed detailed opinions to Mr. Bullitt, opposing all ideas of compromise with the Communist Party and urging the US government and public to recognize reality and provide comprehensive aid to China.

This action by the people of Shanghai is significant. It is a model of active political participation by the people of a democratic country; it is an expansion of the true foundation of democracy. The central authorities have often said in recent years that China is moving towards the path of democracy, and this action by the people of Shanghai is a step towards that path. The US government and public have often said that they are willing to help a Chinese government supported by the people; this action by the people of Shanghai is a true expression of the people's support for the government's suppression of the rebellion.

Shanghai is a city with over a century of international market history. The citizens of Shanghai consist of few locals and many migrants, with bustling commerce and frequent transportation. It implicitly represents the entire country. The actions of Shanghai citizens can influence the entire country. Many influential national organizations largely use Shanghai as a meeting place. The National Federation of Industries, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the National Bankers' Association, the National Native Bankers' Association, the National Federation of Trade Unions, the National Lawyers' Association, the National Medical Association, the National Accountants' Association, etc., their leaders are mostly from Shanghai. Therefore, we believe that the unanimous rise of Shanghai citizens, earnestly contributing resources and efforts, advising on national affairs, sincerely supporting government reforms, supporting government suppression of rebellion, earnestly assisting the authorities, and appealing for foreign aid, will be valued by the government and allied nations, and will surely achieve unimaginable results. Shanghai citizens, especially those with financial resources, must not simply run away in the face of danger. Shanghai citizens should have been actively involved long ago, and now they should continue their efforts, not be intimidated by the Communist propaganda offensive, not be misled by defeatist opportunists, and must blaze a path of prosperity for China in the wilderness full of thorns!

We silently observe that the motives of the representatives of various groups in Shanghai in this appeal and presentation are nothing more than two points: First, internally: thoroughly reform our politics. Second, externally: sincerely seek US assistance. If our speculation is not wrong, Yixian will offer some sincere opinions on these two points.

We cannot and need not deny that our government has many shortcomings, administrative efficiency is very low, corruption among officials is rampant, and especially, governments at all levels do not understand their own powers and responsibilities, so a responsible cabinet system has never been truly established. However, the people have the right and the ability to supervise its reform and renewal. If, in the war to suppress the communists, our people stand idly by or flee, then once the communists succeed and control the entire country, the free life of our entire nation will inevitably be completely lost, let alone anything else. Therefore, in the eyes of people who love democracy and freedom today, it is very simple: despite the unsatisfactory aspects of the government's previous measures, we can only use all our efforts to reform and renew it, and we must not let the Communist Party take its place as a result. The government authorities should be aware of this in time, deeply reproach themselves, accommodate the opinions of the people, accept the advice of friendly countries, and take the initiative to make thorough reforms.

What should the government reform? For example: renewing systems, clarifying powers and responsibilities; simplifying institutions, reducing redundant personnel; eliminating all corrupt habits of bureaucratic red tape; truly improving the treatment of military, government, and educational personnel, strictly implementing assessments of combat and administration, and rewards and punishments for merits and demerits; improving the tax system and grain and labor policies to achieve the goal of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength"; abolishing all controls and restrictions that do not conform to national conditions; changing the policy of "competing with the people for profit" and reducing unnecessary state-owned enterprises; and encouraging private enterprises and free trade as much as possible, so that private capital and foreign capital are willing to invest in production enterprises in the rear provinces and cities. All of these things, all measures that can increase combat power, should be urgently pursued and efforts made. Especially important is that we must establish a system of responsible cabinet that is responsible to the people and responsible to the President, so that the Prime Minister of the Executive Yuan, who organizes this responsible cabinet, can assume full responsibility under the major policy guidelines of suppressing bandits first and quelling rebellion first, and boldly hold all political and economic reforms, so that the people's eyes and ears are refreshed and the views of friendly countries are changed. The situation is already extremely serious, and the fate of the country and the people is at stake, so we cannot allow our officials to continue to treat it as a game! We must never let those who claim to be like former Finance Minister Wang Ling-wu, "an untrained doctor performing surgery, a major operation," take irresponsible action and experiment haphazardly! We must not allow these muddle-headed officials who take blind responsibility to still loaf about in the city! We ask the President to seek out worthy talents, recruit reclusive scholars, and appoint true talents from the business community to enrich the ranks of the new government, and even more so to have a senior official with courage and boldness, who will never be speculative or compromising, who is deeply trusted by the President, and who bears international prestige, to hold the executive power and bear political responsibility to the people on behalf of the head of state. If we can truly organize a wartime cabinet in this way, grit our teeth for the country, I believe it will be far better than the current half-dead, dragging situation, and save this crisis at a critical moment!

Secondly, we must sincerely and honestly request the United States to increase its assistance in a timely manner. The President's direct telegram to President Truman and Madame Chiang's broadcast appeal are both urgent expressions from the government. Our people should also make efforts to explain the dangers facing China and the crisis in Asia in order to awaken the US government and public. After returning to Washington, Secretary of State Marshall has reviewed the world situation with President Truman, first involving the China issue. American public opinion has also advocated "full support for China." This week will be a decisive period. This decision is not only related to the overall situation in China, but also to the overall situation in the East. It is the key to whether the Soviet Union can control the world. China's suppression of the rebellion is actually a vanguard battle in the international war against aggression and totalitarianism. We see that the communists themselves have gained strong external support, but desperately oppose American aid to the National Government, which makes it clear the nature of this war. American aid to China is tantamount to aiding itself. However, we must reflect on ourselves. To ask the United States to provide timely assistance to China, we ourselves must do five things: (1) eliminate all speculative, fence-sitting, and wavering elements so that they cannot act as internal agents for the communists in the wartime government suppressing the rebellion; (2) adhere to the united front with democratic countries so that our diplomatic national policy is clearer and we must not allow a "bi-diplomacy" policy that fantasizes about acting as a bridge between China and the Soviet Union to mislead the overall national situation; (3) explain as much as possible the nature, items, and amounts of military and economic aid that China needs most, while ensuring that various aid is used most effectively; (4) humbly accept the opinions of the US military advisory group and its assistance work, and recruit foreign experts in political, financial, and economic departments and accept their reform suggestions; and (5) openly and honestly provide what conditions China can contribute to the world anti-communist camp so that democratic countries know that China is not a burden that only takes and does not give. In short, when we make friends and seek help, we must be frank and sincere, treat each other with mutual honesty, and be able to share weal and woe. We must never think about opportunism, playing tricks, or showing off, so that there is not a single truly sincere confidant in the international community!

Brave soldiers at the front: This battle of Xuzhou is a critical moment for the survival of our nation, and especially relates to the safety of the constitutional government forged with the blood and iron of our party's more than 50 years of revolution. Our brave soldiers at the front, with a spirit of fearlessness, embracing the determination to die and the belief in certain victory, met the enemy head-on and annihilated hundreds of thousands of rampaging enemies, turning defeat into victory, and turning danger into safety, making the people in the rear who were terrified and could not sleep at ease. The merits of this battle of yours will be like the sun and moon shining through the heavens in history, and this victory is like rivers and seas shaping the earth in the overall situation. Our National Comfort Association expresses our deepest respect to our brave soldiers at the front, and at the same time calls on people from all regions, sectors, and groups to donate wages, salaries, daily food, or daily necessities, to contribute to our soldiers at the front, and provide for their hardships. The first group leader and members flew to the front to visit the brave soldiers of each corps, to express our comfort. We gave special attention to the officers and soldiers in the field hospitals. These small gifts are not to be considered rewards, nor are they considered sympathy, but they carry the sincere feelings of the rear for the front, which cannot be estimated with limited materials. The front and rear are of one mind, our brave soldiers have no worries, and devote themselves to killing the enemy, making persistent efforts, seizing the opportunity, assessing the situation, competing with the stubborn enemy for the last five minutes, and expanding the victory, so that our Three People's Principles democratic country, our freedom-loving people of Yan and Huang, will not be fettered by the iron curtain, trampled by the bridle, destroyed by poison stings, or contaminated by mad dogs. Our founding father's spirit is watching over us, and will surely bless our brave soldiers to achieve great success.

### FINAL JUDGMENT ON CLASS A WAR CRIMINALS; MACARTHUR ANNOUNCES UPHOLDING OF ORIGINAL SENTENCES; EXECUTIONS OF TOJO AND OTHERS TO BE CARRIED OUT IN SECRET

[UNITED PRESS, TOKYO, 24TH] MacArthur issued a judgment revision today on 25 Japanese war criminals, upholding the original sentences of the Far East International Military Tribunal, namely seven to be executed by hanging, sixteen to be sentenced to life imprisonment, and two to be sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term. MacArthur stated: "There were absolutely no errors in the proceedings of the trial, and I see no need to interfere with the original sentences. I hereby order the commander of the Eighth Army to execute the sentences according to the law." The date of the executions will be announced by Zhu. MacArthur also asked believers of all religions in Japan to pray for peace on the day of the executions and to beseech God to guide humanity away from destruction. The seven Japanese war criminals to be executed by hanging are: (1) former Prime Minister Tojo Hideki; (2) the main culprit of the invasion of China, Doihara Kenji; (3) former Prime Minister Hirota Koki; (4) former commander of the Japanese army in Northeast and North China, Itagaki Seishiro; (5) Tojo cabinet's Army Vice-Minister Kimura Heitaro; (6) former commander of the Japanese army in Central China, Matsui Iwane; (7) former commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines, Muto Akira. The sixteen sentenced to life imprisonment are: (1) former Minister of the Army, Araki Sadao; (2) leader of the assassination group, Hashimoto Kingoro; (3) former commander of the Japanese army in Central China, Hata Shunroku; (4) former Prime Minister, Hiranuma Kiichiro; (5) Tojo cabinet's Chief Secretary, Hoshino Naoki; (6) advisor to the Japanese Emperor, Kido Koichi; (7) former Prime Minister, Koiso Kuniaki; (8) Minister of the Army during the Manchurian Incident, Minami Jiro; (9) former Vice-Minister of the Navy, Oka Takazumi; (10) former Ambassador to Germany, Oshima Hiroshi; (11) former Director of the Army Ministry's Bureau of Military Affairs, Sato Kenryo; (12) Minister of the Navy during the Pearl Harbor attack, Shimada Shigetaro; (13) Director of the Tojo cabinet's Planning Board, Suzuki Teiichi; (14) former Minister of Finance, Kaya Okinori; (15) former Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio; (16) former Chief of the Army General Staff, Umezu Yoshijiro.

[CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, TOKYO, 24TH] Lieutenant General Walton Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, announced this afternoon that he has been ordered by General MacArthur to execute the sentences of the Far East International Military Tribunal on the 25 top Japanese war criminals. Walker stated that the time and place of the executions would not be announced in advance, and that news reporters and photographers would not be allowed on the scene. The only observers present would be official military execution personnel.

[NEW ASIA NEWS AGENCY, TOKYO, 24TH] After MacArthur announced his decision to review the sentences of the Japanese Class A war criminals, General Walton Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, immediately paid a visit to MacArthur to request instructions regarding the date and procedures for the executions. Afterwards, Walker announced: "The date for the executions by hanging has not yet been decided, but those sentenced to imprisonment will be executed within five or six days.

[ASSOCIATED PRESS, TOKYO, 24TH] According to unconfirmed rumors, Tojo and the other six Japanese Class A war criminals sentenced to death will be executed by hanging on the morning of December 7th, the anniversary of the "Pearl Harbor Day."

### FULL TEXT OF MACARTHUR'S REVIEW; BELIEVES THE TRIAL PROCESS WAS EXTREMELY FAIR; ASKS THE JAPANESE PEOPLE TO SEEK BLESSINGS FROM HEAVEN

[ASSOCIATED PRESS, TOKYO, 24TH] The full text of MacArthur's review is as follows: "I have drifted in officialdom, but often encountered unsatisfactory matters. However, what I least wanted to do but had to do was this review of the sentences of the Japanese war criminal defendants by the Far East International Military Tribunal. This epoch-making trial aims to weigh the standards of international morality borne by the leaders of a country. I am foolish and my strength is insufficient, and I dare not presumptuously enumerate and define the universally respected principles in the trial.

Since the beginning of chaos, all living beings have thirsted to solve this problem, but the time to solve it may still await the Yellow River to clear. However, in terms of my duties and the limited powers in this case, based on the principles and procedures planned in detail by the relevant Allied countries, there are no technically important errors or omissions in the trial process that require me to intervene in the judgments. What humans decide can never be without error. However, I deeply know that there is no better way to demonstrate justice and fairness than this trial. Clearly, there must be those who are dissatisfied with this judgment, even the erudite judges who formed the court do not entirely agree. However, the evolution of modern society is not yet complete, so there is no other agency that is more qualified and confident to make this solemn judgment. If we cannot trust the rules and responsible persons of this trial, then the world, no matter how big, has nothing to trust. I specially order the commander of the Eighth Army to execute the judgment of the court. When I issue this order, I pray that Heaven will make good use of this tragic trial to show the good people of the world the uselessness of war and that it is merely mankind's greatest sin and most despicable disaster, and to enlighten all countries in the world to jointly despise war. I am startled by this, and I specially request all people of all colors in Japan to stay at home on the day of execution, or gather in public places of prayer, to seek blessings from Heaven, and to wish the world lasting peace and to avoid the devastation of life."

### DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE GUILT EVEN AFTER ABDICATION; JAPANESE EMPEROR DECIDES TO REMAIN ON THE THRONE

TOJO AND OTHERS' FATE CAUSED HIM SEVERAL SLEEPLESS NIGHTS

[CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, TOKYO, 24TH] This morning's newspaper here sold news claiming that Emperor Hirohito, who had been considering abdication due to war responsibility, recently decided to remain on the throne.

The Japanese Emperor, in view of the growing public opinion against his abdication, ultimately believes that this is the best way to compensate for his responsibility for leading Japan into war and its subsequent defeat.

### SIX NEUTRAL NATIONS ATTEMPT TO MEDIATE BERLIN DISPUTE; SEEKING A COMPROMISE; MEETING TO STUDY THE FOUR POWERS' RESPONSES

[UNITED PRESS, PARIS, 24TH] The six neutral nations of the United Nations Security Council are once again attempting to mediate the Berlin dispute today.

The responses of the four powers are scheduled to be released at 4 PM today (standard time). The British side stated that the responses mainly focus on the principles of Berlin currency management.

[ASSOCIATED PRESS, PARIS, 24TH] The United States condemned the Soviet Union on the 24th for interfering with the government of Berlin under four-power occupation, forcing the Berlin crisis to remain unresolved.

In short, the next development of the Berlin problem currently depends on the attitude of the six neutral nations of the Security Council.

Itagaki Seishiro wrote to his wife, saying: "I have adopted a nickname for myself, and I hope the whole family will remember it after my death.

### Comfort Delegation Departs for Xuzhou Today: Delegation Leader Fang Zhi Issues Statement Calling for Donations, Hoping for New Medicines and Pharmaceutical Donations

The delegation of representatives from all sectors of this city to comfort the soldiers at the front line is scheduled to depart for Xuzhou by plane this morning. The reporter made a special visit to the delegation leader Fang Zhi yesterday, who gave a detailed account of the situation and issued a statement, saying: "I have been entrusted by all sectors and will fulfill my national duty by accompanying my colleagues on this delegation to the Xuzhou front line to represent all sectors in comforting our brave soldiers suppressing the communist bandits. Today's war against the communist bandits is a war against aggression, and eliminating the communist bandits is the only current task of the Chinese nation. If the communist bandits are not eliminated, China will not be secure; only with victory in suppressing the communist bandits will the masses have hope for survival. Our compatriots in the rear must remain calm and composed during this tense time of suppressing the communist bandits, without being threatened by bandit rumors and without planning for a life of ease and comfort. If China becomes communist, even the United States will not be safe. If Shanghai becomes communist, Taiwan and Hong Kong will not be guaranteed. Therefore, only by working together to contribute money and effort to eliminate the communist bandits can we find our only way out. For this comfort mission to the Xubeng front line, the industrial and commercial sectors and enthusiastic patriots have donated a large number of daily necessities, such as towels, gloves, socks, sanitary shirts, cigarettes, candy, etc., totaling no less than one hundred tons, which our delegation will bring to the front to comfort the soldiers. We are also continuing to expand recruitment. This can be called the supreme glory of the people of Shanghai and is something that the soldiers at the front will be happy and encouraged by. However, the most urgently needed items at the front are various medicines, such as first aid kits, gauze, cotton, penicillin, anti-inflammatory pills, tetanus antitoxin, etc. This large-scale battle will inevitably result in many casualties, and how to ensure their early recovery and return to the front line is currently the most urgent matter. I hope that our colleagues in the new medicine and pharmaceutical industries will make great contributions and donate as much as possible, or purchase some at cost, so that they can be transported to the front line separately. Our delegation is scheduled to depart this morning. If there are any matters in the future, please contact Mr. Xu Mingya and Mr. Chen Baotai directly at the temporary office of the Comfort Association of the Friends of the Military at Zha Pu Road (telephone 40145)."

### Tragedy on Xin Qiao Road: One Word Leads to Two Deaths; Beef Stall Owner Stabs Fellow Tradesman to Death, Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat Out of Fear of Punishment; Main Reason Was Love Triangle

[Our Report] Zhou Qingbo, a 39-year-old Chaozhou native, ran a beef stall at No. 420 Xin Zha Road, in front of the Xinhua Bank. Several years ago, he became involved with Xu Wanshi, a 44-year-old widow from Huangdu, who lived at No. 4, Renji Lane, No. 433 Xin Zha Road. Her husband had passed away eight years ago, and her daughter had married. Her relationship with Zhou became increasingly intimate, and she rented a small house for him at No. 5, Yongshou Lane, Tangjiawan, Zhao Zhou Road, Nanshi. At the beginning of this month, Zhou began a new relationship, cohabitating with a woman named Wu Chunjuan from the same hometown at the aforementioned location. On the 7th, Xu Wanshi went to Yongshou Lane and found Wu Chunjuan and Zhou together. When she asked Chunjuan, she learned everything. Xu was extremely angry and had a quarrel with Zhou, then left quickly. Afterwards, Zhou, seeing that things had reached this point, expressed his desire to break off relations with her and gave her seven dozen towels and returned two liang of gold jewelry. Zhou's fellow townsman, Yao Ziming, lived at No. 40 Xin Qiao Road. In the past, he had partnered with Zhou to run a chicken and duck blood stall. Three years ago, due to conflicting opinions, the two parted ways, and Yao set up his own stall. On the 21st, Xu encountered Yao Ziming on the road, and they chatted. Yao told her that Zhou's first wife was begging for a living in his hometown and that his two sons had died. Zhou was truly a heartless man. The next day, Zhou met Xu again, and she confronted him with Yao's words, accusing him of being a beast in human clothing. Zhou, harboring resentment, suddenly had the idea of killing Yao. At around 11:30 AM yesterday, he took a beef-cutting knife and ran to Yao's stall on Xin Qiao Road, stabbing Yao in the right waist. Yao fell to the ground with serious injuries. Seeing the major disaster he had caused, Zhou used the knife to slit his own throat, cutting off his esophagus and trachea. He lay dying. The police, having been alerted, rushed to the scene and quickly reported to the Xin Cheng Police Branch. Chief Hao sent officer Weng Yongquan and other officers to the scene. Yao was already dead. The murderer Zhou Qingbo was rushed to Hongren Hospital, but he died fifteen minutes later due to his severe injuries. Afterwards, the officers in charge of the case interrogated relevant witnesses such as Xu Wanshi and Wu Chunjuan. The two corpses were sent to the autopsy center on Changde Road to await examination.

The speech lasted for more than an hour. After the speech, all employees expressed satisfaction with the adjusted treatment plan and immediately began to resume work.

### Silver Shops Unable to Open Today; Price Negotiations Still Pending Further Consultation

[Our Report] The Silver Shops Association held a board meeting yesterday, but no results were achieved. In addition, as the Currency Administration's public announcement of resumption of business has not yet been received, it is impossible to open for business today. Furthermore, the exchange rate negotiated by the industry and the Bureau of Social Affairs was originally based on the national bank's gold price of 1,000 yuan, plus 60% for labor costs, 40% for operating expenses, and 20% for legal profits.

### Six Officials in Fuel Management Committee Embezzlement Case Sentenced to Imprisonment; Indictments Against Dai Weihua and Three Others Not Accepted; Mao Meixuan and Sun Zhigang Declared Not Guilty

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee's senior staff embezzlement and corruption case, which had been repeatedly tried by the District Court, was sentenced at 9:30 yesterday morning. The main points were: Yang Yunfu (former Transportation Director of the Fuel Management Committee) and Zou Jidao (clerk of the Fuel Management Committee and coal merchant) were each sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for five years for jointly and continuously accepting bribes for actions that violated their duties. Zhao Bojun (retired military officer) was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years for assisting others in committing the crime of using his position to seek benefits in matters under supervision or control. Sun Jice (Director of the Allocation Department of the Fuel Management Committee) was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for five years for jointly and continuously extorting money. Lin Keying (Section Chief of the Allocation Department of the Fuel Management Committee) was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years for jointly and continuously extorting money. Miao Suizi (clerk of the Fuel Management Committee) was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years for jointly and continuously accepting bribes for actions that violated her duties. The indictments against Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui (all clerks of the Fuel Management Committee), and Han Chengpu (coal merchant) were not accepted. Mao Meixuan (coal merchant) and Sun Zhigang (general affairs of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company) were found not guilty. The reasons for the court's verdict (omitting the facts of the crimes) and the legal provisions violated are recorded below:

Yang Yunfu, Zou Jidao, Miao Shouzi, and Zhao Bojun's Section:

It was found that the accused Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao colluded to seek profits and handle coal purchase certificates for others, and that the accused Zhao Bojun acted as an intermediary. Because the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Department received a confidential report, it immediately sent officials Chen Zhixiang and Tang Kejun, using the aliases Tang Gengsheng and posing as merchants, to contact the accused Zhao Bojun. After an agreement was reached at the Queen Cafe, the certificates and money were exchanged, and they were immediately arrested by police officers who had been arranged in advance. The fact that purchase certificates and money were found was confirmed. The details of the process were thoroughly described in court by Wang Sizu, the leader of the Economic Police Brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, who handled the case, Tang Kejun, who posed as a merchant, and Le Zhuangxin, the investigator from the Investigation Department. According to the interrogation, the accused Yang Yunfu admitted that he had acted on Zhao Bojun's request and ordered Zou Jidao to apply for purchase certificates in the name of the Gongda Coal Company, which he co-owned with Mao Meixuan, which was consistent with the confessions of the accused Zhao Bojun and Zou Jidao. Although Yang Yunfu argued that he was unaware that Zhao Bojun had received money, and Zhao Bojun also claimed that the money received was used as a guarantee deposit, it was found that the accused Zhao Bojun's explanation of the meaning of the guarantee deposit was that Director Yang (referring to Yang Yunfu) told me that the coal delivered to Shanghai had to be sold to Gongda Coal Company, and they needed to give Gongda Coal Company 2%. I was afraid that Chen Zhixiang was unreliable, so I asked him for a guarantee, and because he couldn't find one, he was willing to provide a cash guarantee. However, Mao Meixuan, who co-owned Gongda Coal Company with Zou Jidao, stated that he only knew about applying for purchase certificates for others and denied any intention of taking commission or a guarantee deposit. If they were not sharing the benefits, why would they handle everything for him? Based on the circumstances of the case, the testimonies of the accused, and the information received by the Investigation Bureau, it can be concluded that the accused Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao jointly used their positions as staff members of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee to seek benefits in issuing purchase certificates, even though it was not a matter under their direct supervision or control, and that the accused Zhao Bojun provided significant assistance in this activity. These facts can be established with certainty. Furthermore, it was found that the accused Yang Yunfu, Zou Jidao, and Miao Shouzi accepted bribes from merchants regarding controlled coal transported from Beijing to Shanghai, which was not allowed to be imported according to regulations. Not only did the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Department receive a confidential report and confirm it, but during the trial, Pan Zongli, the owner of Yuda Coal Company, Lu Shouchen, the owner of Ganji Coal Company, and Ge Jihua, the owner of Huamao Coal Company, testified in court that they had transported coal to Shanghai by land and water and had either directly paid "transportation fees" and "tips" to Zou Jidao, a clerk of the Fuel Management Committee, or entrusted Zhang Tiancai of Zhang Jinji Customs Brokerage to handle it. The accused Zou Jidao admitted to this without exception, which was consistent with Zhang Tiancai's testimony. It was also found that Zou Jidao stated at the police station on September 23 of this year that the reason for not detaining the inspected controlled coal was, "Initially, we reported it to Section Chief Yang Yunfu, but Section Chief Yang did not make a decision. So, some of it was purchased at the official price, but later, because the coal merchants were all acquaintances, they were willing to take out some money to give to the Fuel Management Committee, requesting that they not be purchased and that they be released. At first, it was 20,000 yuan per ton, then the coal merchants voluntarily increased it to 40,000 yuan and 60,000 yuan. Recently, it has been 100,000 yuan per ton. Miao Shouzi and I went to the coal market every day to investigate coal market prices, and the merchants gave it to us. We gave it to Section Chief Yang Yunfu. Sometimes Miao gave it to Yang, and sometimes I gave it to Yang." There are copies of the police station's records available as evidence. The fact that the accused Yang Yunfu, Zou Jidao, and Miao Shouzi jointly and continuously accepted bribes for actions that violated their duties can also be established with certainty. Although the accused Yang Yunfu consistently denied receiving these funds and argued that the import of controlled coal was because there was a shortage of coal in Shanghai, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed him in person when he came to Shanghai that coal was not comparable to opium and that it would be permissible to handle it flexibly, the controlled coal was already a predetermined economic measure of the government. Even if there was a desire to change the original plan, there must have been a formal order from the superior authority. Since the accused has not presented any solid evidence, his empty words of defense are difficult to believe. As for the accused Zou Jidao's defense that the money received was purely for transportation, it is inconsistent with his initial confession to the police station, which is clearly a confession retracted out of fear of punishment and cannot be accepted. Although the accused Miao Shouzi completely denied the matter during the trial, when the police station interrogated her about whether she had shared the profits, she replied, "Apart from occasional transportation fees, there was nothing else." The fact that she had taken bribes had already been revealed. Moreover, it is consistent with what the owners of the above-mentioned coal companies said about the name of the transportation fee, which cannot be denied by retracting the confession. However, the crimes of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes by the accused Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao, and the crime of using their position to seek profits, are continuous acts that constitute the same type of corruption crime and should be considered as one crime. Also, since the accused Zhao Bojun was an accomplice, his sentence should be reduced compared to that of the principal offender. Furthermore, the accused Miao Shouzi was in a low position and committed a minor crime. Because of her meager income, she took the risk, which is still somewhat pitiable, and her sentence should also be reduced accordingly.

Sun Jice and Lin Keying's Section:

It was found that the accused Sun Jice was the director of the Allocation Department of the Fuel Management Committee, and the accused Lin Keying was the section chief of the Business Section of the same department. The allocation and sale of coal was a matter under their supervision and control. Because they wanted to take the opportunity to seek profits, they colluded with Wang Jianping and Ma Zhongliang, who were engaged in the shipping business, to over-allocate coal to shipping operators for sale on the black market, and the profits were divided four-six. They also extorted money from Songjiang Electric Company and Suzhou Electric Company and accepted gifts from Wujin Electric Company. The Shanghai Municipal Investigation Department has clarified this through information and investigation, and some checks have also been found with attached photos and letters on file. Although Wang Jianping and Ma Zhongliang fled out of fear of punishment after the case was revealed and could not be found for questioning, Shen Jinfu, a shareholder of Shenjiang Yuanda Shenxing Towboat Bureau, Yu Guanshen of Yuanda Towboat Bureau, Cheng Yuguang of Detai Towboat Bureau, Yan Azhang and Han Funan of Yuanda Towboat Bureau, and Lu Guangsheng of Hongli Towboat Bureau all testified in court that the coal allocation was handled by Ma Zhongliang on their behalf, and the allocated coal was split four-six, with Ma Zhongliang taking 40%, which he said was given to the Fuel Management Committee. Chen Xuewen, the owner of Xieli Shipping Bureau, stated: The coal allocation was split four-six, and the money was handed over to Zhu Xueming and Wang Jianping for delivery to the Fuel Management Committee. Le Xiaoshun, the manager of Yuanchang Shipping Bureau, testified that the allocated coal was split four-six, and the money was handed over to Wang Jianping for delivery to Section Chief Lin. All have been verified and recorded. It also coincides with what Han Chengpu, who sold the over-allocated coal on the black market for various shipping bureaus, confessed to the police station and the court. The fact that the accused colluded with Wang Jianping and Ma Zhongliang, who are on the run, to over-allocate coal to various shipping bureaus for profit is indeed well-founded and cannot be evaded with empty words. Furthermore, He Zhiying, the person in charge of the Shenhu Line Joint Business Office, contacted Sun Jice and Lin Keying to obtain more coal allocation. As for the method of contact, initially, they hosted three banquets at the International Hotel's Fengze Restaurant and Wang Daping's home, and then bribed them with festival gifts. Also, because the accused Lin Keying deliberately made things difficult for the coal allocation applications and did not approve them, they bribed him with checks and cash. He Zhiying also stated this in detail at the police station on September 30 of this year, and there is a copy of the investigation record available for verification. She also testified in court during the trial, which is also consistent and cannot be denied by the accused's evasive words. Furthermore, the details of how the accused Sun Jice and Lin Keying jointly extorted money from Songjiang Electric Company, how they received the funds, and how they received gifts from Wujin Electric Company, and how the accused Sun Jice extorted money from Suzhou Electric Company have all been described in detail by Shi Jianren, the manager of Songjiang Electric Company, Wang Chao Yi, an employee of Wujin Electric Company, and Zhang Saitong, the manager of Suzhou Electric Company, in court, and have been verified and recorded on file. These witnesses do not usually have any connection with each other, and they do not have any grievances with the accused. Their testimonies are consistent, and they are unlikely to make false accusations out of thin air, so they can be believed to be true. Moreover, it is consistent with the report of the investigation process by Le Zhuangxin, an investigator from the Investigation Department, and cannot be refuted by the accused's empty words. The facts of the crimes of the two accused can be established. What they did was either extortion, dereliction of duty and accepting bribes, or directly or indirectly seeking profits in matters under their supervision. Some of the actions were joint, and some were individual. However, they were all based on a single, overarching criminal intent, continuing several acts and committing the same type of crime, which should be considered as one crime according to the law. However, since the accused Lin Keying was only a business section chief, the decision on coal allocation depended on his superior, the director of the Allocation Department. He was in a lower position and received fewer bribes, which is more pitiful and forgiving. His sentence should be reduced accordingly according to the law.

Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, and Han Chengpu's Section:

It was found that the accused Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, and Ren Hui, as stated in the police station's transfer document, were all employees of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee and were given bribes after the accused Zou Jidao accepted the bribes. However, there was no connection of criminal intent or division of action with the joint corruption activities of Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao. Therefore, they cannot be considered as joint corruption. What they did only constitutes the crime of receiving stolen goods under ordinary criminal law. Also, the accused Han Chengpu sold the over-allocated coal on the black market for the above-mentioned shipping bureaus. His actions are certainly difficult to forgive. However, there was no direct connection of criminal intent with the corruption offenders, and he only constitutes the crime of brokering stolen goods under ordinary criminal law. These are not within the scope of special criminal cases. Without investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor, this court cannot directly try them. It should be recognized that the prosecution violated the procedural regulations, and a judgment of non-acceptance should be announced (after this judgment becomes final, it should be transferred to the prosecutor for investigation in order to comply with the regulations).

Mao Meixuan and Sun Zhigang's Section:

It was found that the accused Mao Meixuan and Zou Jidao jointly established Gongda Coal Company, and Zou Jidao independently decided to use Gongda Coal Company to apply for coal purchase certificates for others. This was admitted by Mao Meixuan, but there is no conclusive evidence to prove whether there was a connection of criminal intent with Zou Jidao. Since he has no criminal responsibility, he cannot be held criminally liable. Also, the accused Sun Zhigang was the general affairs officer of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company and was instructed by Wang Jianping, the assistant manager of the company, to purchase gifts and order the tea room to send gifts to Sun Jice and Lin Keying. This is a fact admitted by him. However, his position was general affairs, and it was within his duty to purchase gifts on behalf. There is no evidence to prove whether the purchased gifts were used for criminal purposes, that is, whether he subjectively had knowledge of the crime. Therefore, there is also no responsibility to speak of, and he cannot be held criminally liable. According to the law, a verdict of not guilty should be announced together. In summary, it should be based on Article 1 and Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, the first paragraph of Article 291, Article 293, Paragraph 1, and Article 295, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 2, Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 7, Article 3, Paragraph 3, Article 11, and Article 16 of the Punishment of Corruption Regulations, the first clause of Article 11, Article 28, the first clause of Article 56, Article 59, Article 73, Article 64, Paragraph 2, Article 65, Paragraph 2, and the first clause of Article 66 of the Criminal Law, Article 20, Paragraphs 1 and 2, and Article 37, Paragraphs 2 and 3, and the judgment is as stated in the main text.

### Three Women Prosecuted for Manslaughter After Catching Adultery

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yan Aibao, Yan Guibao, and Yan Zhu Yuebao were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday on suspicion of causing death by injury. The reason is that Yan Aibao's husband, Zhu Jinfu, met a woman named Jiang Hongyun in the spring of this year and secretly met her at a hotel. At 8:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month, Zhu again took Jiang Hongyun to Room 529 of the Jinshan Hotel on Hankou Road for a secret rendezvous. The plot was discovered by Yan Aibao, who then invited her sister, Yan Guibao, and her sister-in-law, Yan Zhu Yuebao, to catch the adultery. They ganged up to beat and humiliate Jiang Hongyun. Yan Aibao pushed her to the ground, and Yan Guibao kicked her forcefully in the lower abdomen with her leather shoes, causing serious injuries to Jiang's chest and abdomen. Jiang Hongyun, overcome with pain and shame, took the opportunity to stand up from the ground and ran to the window, escaping without a trace. The police station detained the three women, Yan Aibao, and sent them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ding Guitang, Director of the Jianghai Customs Junpu Bureau, Shi Konghuai, Deputy Director, and others reported to Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 11:00 a.m. yesterday regarding the excessive demands made by the temporary workers at the Zhanghuabang Shipyard under the bureau, requesting assistance in mediation. It is said that the factory employs 100 long-term workers, whose wages are paid in accordance with the central government's regulations and treatment methods. If there is a real need, temporary workers are hired and paid daily according to the cost-of-living index. Recently, this group of workers suddenly demanded that each person be allocated three dou of rice per month, a one-month loan of wages, and a one-year severance payment upon dismissal, which was rejected by the factory. Work at the entire factory was suspended from the afternoon before yesterday. Mayor Wu has now ordered the Police Department to send officers to maintain order.

### Private Planes Chartered by the Wealthy to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Taichung; One Flight Daily

Recently, the number of wealthy individuals chartering planes to fly to foreign countries and domestic locations such as Taiwan, Guangzhou, Kunming, and Dianqing has gradually increased. According to the China Airlines Company, the government has not issued a clear prohibition on charter flights, so the company continues to accept applications from passengers to charter private planes. However, the fare must include the return trip. Recently, there has been an average of one charter flight per day, with Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Taiwan being the most common destinations. In order to properly allocate the use of charter planes, the company has entrusted various travel agencies to handle the arrangements.

At the end of the first half, Renyu took the lead with 28-23. After the break, the battle resumed. Renyu's Le Jiaozhou was guarded by Chunmao, and he did not perform much.

### Handling of Government Bonds; Ministry of Finance Revising Separately; Original Conversion Rates to Be Followed Before Announcement

[Our Report] Since the announcement of the "Revised Regulations for the Issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates" and the "Regulations for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Held by the People," the Ministry of Finance is separately revising the handling methods for legal tender government bonds and foreign currency bonds, and submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Before the announcement of the new handling methods, the registration and exchange of foreign currency bonds for new bonds will temporarily be handled according to the original conversion rates. After the revised methods are announced, all past bondholders who have already applied for registration and obtained receipts will have their new bonds exchanged at the new conversion rates based on the amount of foreign currency bonds stated on the original receipts.

Applications for early redemption of legal tender government bonds will temporarily be paid in Gold Yuan Certificates at the original doubled conversion rate. However, bondholders should properly preserve their application forms. After the revised handling methods are announced, they can use the seal on the original application form and provide a guarantor to claim the additional amount from the original managing bank or bureau.

### Relaxing Restrictions on Imports of Non-Quota Goods Under Consideration

To Address Domestic Supply Needs

Since the government announced the implementation of the import-export linkage system, the Import and Export Management Committee, considering that the foreign exchange needed for non-quota imports no longer needs to be provided by the state, is considering relaxing the review standards for imports of goods listed in Schedules (1) and (2) A, in order to address the domestic shortage of materials. It is reported that this consideration includes items that were previously approved for import but have been temporarily suspended, items that were previously omitted but are truly needed domestically, items that are produced domestically but whose quantity or quality is insufficient to meet actual needs, and daily necessities, equipment, and raw materials produced by Chinese-owned factories abroad that are truly needed domestically.

[Our Report] According to the Import and Export Management Committee, the existing "quota imports" and "non-quota imports" will continue to be handled as usual after the implementation of the import-export linkage system, and future quotas will be announced. According to import and export industry sources, in principle, the quantity of imports will be based on the quantity of exports under the new system. However, at present, it is the off-season for exports, new goods have not yet entered the market in large quantities, and existing inventory has been sold out. Furthermore, the domestic prices of export goods are higher than those in the world market, resulting in sluggish exports. Under the linkage system, imports cannot be increased either. Therefore, in order to prevent a shortage of raw materials and supplies domestically, it is still necessary to separately approve a portion of the import quota to make adjustments.

### Yarn Market Hovering with Slight Increase; Cotton Cloth Trend Weakening

Yesterday, the yarn market saw some scattered purchases from client groups due to the easing of credit in the market, and local yarn firms also absorbed some supply. The initial asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was similar to the previous closing price, but in the middle of the day, there was no intention from various parties to make purchases, and it was once seen to fall by around 1,000 yuan. As the closing time approached, the client groups took action first, and yarn firms followed suit in purchasing, and the asking price finally reached the same level as the previous day, and continued to rise to close at 11,200 yuan, a rebound of 200 yuan from the previous day.

The initial asking price for 21-count Double Horse yarn was also low, but later, due to limited supply, the market saw a rebound to close at 8,100 yuan, also up 200 yuan. The next-day bill was quoted at 8,300 yuan. Other counts of blended fine yarn also followed suit with increases ranging from 100 to 500 yuan.

The cotton cloth market trend hovered and softened. Client groups continued to sell off, and local cloth merchants also sold at high prices. Although retail sales had already improved, the increased allocation of textiles made it difficult for asking prices to rally. The initial asking price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a high of 380 yuan, but after one day, due to abundant supply and weak demand, northern client groups stopped buying and started selling, and the price immediately fell back. Near the noon closing, it remained at the original closing price of 365 yuan.

There were many scattered sales and northern client groups sold off a large quantity of Four Gentlemen Yuan Piji, closing at an asking price of 355 yuan, 5 yuan lower than the previous day. The trading of other lower-end fine cloths was not weak, but asking prices were soft after an initial rise. The application price for textiles allocated by the textile factory was about 30 to 40 yuan lower than the market price, and there were few applicants.

### Raw Cotton Quiet

The raw cotton market remained flat, with only sporadic transactions. Supply from fellow traders was scarce, and factory purchases were also weak. Trading remained mostly quiet. Zhoupu seed cotton was priced at 275-295 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Trading Active Yesterday

Trading in foreign exchange transfer certificates became active yesterday, with prices at 25 yuan and a large number of transactions. The Bank of China was the largest seller, accounting for over 300,000 US dollars. In addition, there were also transactions in overseas remittance transfer certificates yesterday, with prices slightly higher than those for export.

### Tung Oil Market Sentiment Rising

Exported Tung oil is a bulk commodity. Since the announcement of the new foreign exchange transaction methods, and because it was heard that the current international market is also picking up, frequent market agitation has been stirred, and sellers' asking prices have been rising rapidly. The market sentiment has been soaring non-stop. Until the market closing, although credit conditions eased, the availability of cash remained tight, and the rising trend began to slow, but compared to the previous day, the increase was significant. The prices of various grades of Zhengfu, Xihong and Hankou Ao Hong all followed suit.

### Taiwan Sugar Weak

The sugar market saw further weakness yesterday. Due to transportation difficulties, client groups from other ports kept selling off, and northern client groups sold off continuously. The market was weak and lifeless. Local retail sales have been sluggish recently, and buying sentiment is weak. The market was flooded with supply, and all grades were weak. No. 45 white sugar opened at 370 yuan in the morning, then immediately fell and closed at 350 yuan. It was rumored that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation would soon allocate medium and coarse sugar, making people anxious. These sugars also closed down 5 yuan and 10 yuan respectively. All remaining grades had no outstanding price movements.

### Artificial Silk Allocation Price

[Our Report] The China Trust Bureau decided at a meeting yesterday that the price for artificial silk from the 22nd to the 27th would be 9,660 yuan per case for Italian artificial silk, grade three, 120 count, with luster.

### Supply Still Quite Strong; Rice Market Calm; Flour and Edible Oil Both Weak

The rice market trend was stable. The market started slowly yesterday morning due to the cloudy and rainy weather. Prices continued to decline. In the middle of the day, a considerable amount of credit was released from various parties, and retail buyers were very active. Only Japonica rice rose by 10 yuan, opening at 460 yuan. Early rice rose by 5 yuan, and other grades of thin rice remained unchanged. Arrivals in the two markets were: 4,114 piculs in the South Market and 5,331 piculs in the North Market, for a total of 9,445 piculs, an increase in supply.

The flour market weakened further due to the continued weakness of the rice market. Transactions became quieter, and prices continued to decline. Bingchuan flour was 142 yuan, down 5 yuan from the previous day. Lao Che opened at 149 yuan and closed down to 145 yuan, a drop of 9 yuan. Other Red Bee flour dropped by 13 yuan, and Jiancheng flour dropped by 7 yuan. Bran was even weaker, with Fuxin large bags at 90 yuan.

Prices of miscellaneous grains outside the circle also declined and were sluggish. The market prices yesterday fell for all prices except for white sesame for export, which rose. Guide white sesame was 335 yuan, and Hankou white perilla was 330 yuan, each up 30-40 yuan. Hankou Mung bean was 170 yuan, and Pudong Du bean was 210 yuan, each down 10 yuan. Corn was steady, red sorghum was down 15 yuan, and Mingguang red sorghum was 90 yuan.

The edible oil market weakened yesterday, and retail sales were extremely sluggish. Jiangbei Jilong peanut oil was 1,020 yuan, down 20 yuan. This factory's soybean oil, Dayouyu opened at 810 yuan, closing down to 800 yuan. Datong, Dachangxin, and Dade xin all retreated to 790 yuan, each down 10 yuan. This factory's rapeseed oil saw a sharper decline, Dayouyu fell to 630 yuan, a sharp drop of 50 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil was steady and unchanged. Sesame oil was relatively stable and flat with yesterday's market. Soybean cake trading was scarce, and market prices rebounded, with Changzi cake at 65 yuan, down 4 yuan from the previous market.

### Relief Sculpture of Nine Counties in Southern Jiangxi

— Our Correspondent Liu Zao

[South Nanchang, 21st Quick News] The counties under the jurisdiction of Southern Jiangxi, including Ganxian, Nankang, Shangyou, Chongyi, Dayu, Xinfeng, Longnan, Qiannan, and Dingnan, are a mountainous area bordering northern Guangdong. There, is the world-renowned tungsten mine, as well as the communist bandits who often use this mountainous area as a base, and the newly constructed county government foundations.

Director of Education Department Zhou Bangdao, was sent to Ganxian to attend the administrative meeting of the Fourth Administrative Region, and went to the counties under his jurisdiction to supervise and urge the collection of grain. Zhou, who has always been regarded as a dangerous area in the border region, also ventured there and truly looked at the local politics and border security of the remote counties. Zhou returned from his official duties a few days ago and talked with reporters about his impressions of Southern Jiangxi.

Difficult to Transport Grain in the Mountainous Southern Jiangxi

The main political task of Jiangxi at this stage is to urge the recruitment of soldiers and the collection of grain. Telegrams from the central government urging the provincial government to collect grain are flying in like snowflakes, and the senior officials of the provincial government are also going on inspection tours. Although many people at the meetings of popular opinion organs are shouting for strengthening local education and construction, and opposing the dispatch of education and construction personnel of the county government to the countryside for errands, the Director of Education comes to the county to supervise, and the Director of Construction comes to closely monitor... The county magistrate and the entire team of the county government have to urge one step at a time and pursue one layer at a time, like stepping down a stone staircase. Currently, as of the end of October, the new taxes of various counties in Southern Jiangxi have been collected as follows: Dayu has collected over 40% of its quota, Ganxian, Shangyou, and Xinfeng have collected over 30%, Nankang and Longnan have collected less than 30%, and Chongyi, Qiannan, and Dingnan are currency-collecting counties, and have all started collecting. Now, the counties have separately organized supervision teams to go to the countryside to supervise and urge, and it is possible that the full amount will be collected as scheduled.

Southern Jiangxi is mostly mountainous, and it is difficult to be self-sufficient in grain. Under today's high-pressure living conditions, the mountain people are able to actively hand over grain and taxes. Just as Xiong Shihui said when he returned to Jiangxi last time: they are truly "good people who will hand over grain if they have grain." However, there is now a difficult problem in grain administration: it is impossible to transport.

Although the Gan River originates in Southern Jiangxi and flows to Poyang, due to the current winter season, the river is shallow and navigation is inconvenient. Moreover, due to insufficient ships and low freight rates, most boatmen deliberately avoid it, which affects the grain transport. Although the current freight rate has been slightly increased, the boatmen still cannot maintain their minimum living standards, not to mention that there are also some unscrupulous "grain officials" who try every means to make things difficult for the boatmen and extort money from them.

Good Foundation for Education and Construction

In Southern Jiangxi, education and construction have indeed laid a good foundation. The public school funds of the counties have mostly been cleared and used as school foundations. Counties such as Nankang, Shangyou, Chongyi, and Dayu have already held school grain donations, which are centrally managed and distributed in a coordinated manner. This has solved the funding problem for national education in the counties. Therefore, the national school teachers in the counties of Southern Jiangxi have stable lives and work hard. Many new school buildings have also been built at all levels, especially the school buildings of Xinfeng County Middle School, which are particularly large in scale. Even the provincial middle school buildings dare not compare with "Xinfeng Middle School." The number of national schools has reached the standard of "one school per Bao," and the number of students is also sufficient. National education has established a good foundation in Southern Jiangxi. According to Zhou's recent inspection, Ganxian is the best in terms of academic performance.

Important County Roads Under Construction

Southern Jiangxi's construction, during the administration of Chiang Ching-kuo, has already achieved considerable success. Such as the county government, county council, county auditorium, county middle school, health centers, township offices, national schools, as well as the necessary public places, have been completed one after another, with brand new houses. The telephone lines in the townships and towns of the counties have also been set up and are communicating, which is a great help to local security. As long as there are bandits in area A, the garrison or self-defense team in area B can immediately come to support. At present, the important county roads in the counties of Southern Jiangxi, such as the Gan-You, Xing-Gan, and Gan-Sui lines, are being built at an accelerated pace. Small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have also been started.

The construction of county roads was a major administrative measure during Wang Luji's administration of Jiangxi three years ago. He once proposed: "Plant fields in the first half of the year, and build roads in the second half of the year." However, when we review the number of roads completed in Jiangxi counties and the number of abandoned fields reclaimed by the people in the past three years, it is truly disheartening. When I went to Zhangshu last month to visit the pre-Han site, I stepped on a section of road from Zhangshu to Linchuan. On the highway, the road surface was still rugged and uneven. Although wooden frames were installed on all the ditches and bridges, and bridge panels were laid that were too thin to walk on, no one cared about the few Dan of earth at the end of the bridge, which still made this section of highway disconnected from pedestrians. From this section of highway, which was almost open to traffic but disconnected from people, we can also see one aspect of Jiangxi's construction industry.

Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Area Incursions

The local security in Southern Jiangxi has always been valued. Although it is now relatively peaceful, it must not be neglected, because Youshan and Maozi Peak are the bases of the so-called "Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Area People's Liberation General Team." They now have nearly a thousand people with guns, sometimes integrating the scattered forces to raid everywhere, or dispersing the integrated forces to hide deep in the mountains, reorganize, and train.

At present, the standing self-defense teams and the people's self-defense teams of the counties have been formed. The organization and training of the people in Chongyi has been particularly effective due to the efforts of Deputy Commander Huang Yilian. However, the weapons of the counties are old and complex, and the self-defense forces are still weak. Especially in the areas connected to Dayu, Xinti, Longnan, and San Nan, there are occasional bandit alerts. This is a "turbulent area" that deserves attention.

In any case, the cornerstone of Southern Jiangxi's construction is relatively solid. There is now a new atmosphere remaining, although it has been diluted a lot, but compared to the local bullies and gangsters and the rampant black forces in other areas, it can be regarded as maintaining a bit of a new impression for people.

### Recognize the Target

— Jingwen

A daughter of the neighbor brought back a letter from her school the other day, and also attached a donation booklet for expanding the school building fund. Because I also saw it, I wanted to say a few words.

The content of the letter, needless to say, is the issue of schools collecting tuition fees that newspapers have been discussing these days, but the school does not say that it is collecting tuition fees, but only calls it "colleague living subsidy," and also attaches a condition that if parents can solicit donations exceeding the "due payment" of students' "colleague living subsidy," they can be exempted from paying this subsidy.

It can be said that they have thought of a very thorough method, because the "colleague living subsidy" has its own difficulties, and the burden on parents cannot be ignored, and the work of expanding the school building cannot be interrupted, as the original letter said, it is "taking care of all three parties."

Anyone who lives on salary should sympathize with the poor lives of teachers. Especially after the currency reform, the impact of rising prices on teachers is more than that of other salaried classes. Because teachers' salaries are usually paid once or twice before and after the start of school. Now the most difficult are civil servants, who can still get a 1.5 times increase, but private school teachers cannot even get this. Some teachers may have always taken the money to pre-purchase firewood, rice, oil, and salt, but it is impossible to make a half-year living budget with this not very large amount of money. Not to mention that teachers are not as good at calculating as businessmen. They may have initially believed in the Gold Yuan Certificate and deposited the money in the bank or lent it out for interest, but now it is not enough to buy a Dan of rice!

This reality is understood by most people. However, understanding teachers does not mean sympathizing with schools. We must distinguish this clearly.

Education is sacred, but many private schools in Shanghai have always been called "school shops." In fact, with very few exceptions, it is true. Since it is called "school shop," then standing on the position of the "shop," there is no reason to collect money after the transaction is completed. This is the general rule in the business world, which is also the "contract" relationship commonly referred to in today's society, and is one of the basic conditions for the stability of the economic society. For example, if someone bought a Shi of rice from a rice shop two months ago for 20 yuan, the rice shop owner cannot ask the customer to collect 480 yuan of "subsidy" today when the price of rice is 500 yuan a Shi on the grounds of subsidizing the lives of their colleagues in the shop.

Schools are different from ordinary stores, because they sell not goods but services, and they are continuous. However, ordinary professionals cannot ask the service organization to collect subsidies because they are still providing services. For example, we writers cannot ask the publishing organization to request subsidies. If we say that now workers can be paid according to the cost of living index, but teachers cannot, but this has already been said before, teachers' salaries were paid once during a period of relatively stable prices, while other salaried classes are not.

The above is not to say that the author does not sympathize with the difficult living conditions of teachers, but the responsibility cannot be borne by the general parents. Teachers should recognize the target. In private schools, their responsible persons should be the board of directors and the principal. In municipal schools, it should be the government. Especially in private schools, there are many people who started their businesses with "running schools." At this time, if they use names such as "collecting" or "subsidy," even if they succeed, it may still not be of much practical benefit to the teachers, and it will damage the reputation of the teachers. Just imagine that the school building fund can be used to offset the living subsidy, isn't this a complete depiction of the face of the "school shop" owner?

### "The Most Solid" Vault

— Shi Wen

In 1800, shortly after the Bank of England in London moved to its newly built site, a worker suddenly asked to see the manager of the bank, saying that he knew someone in the city could secretly enter and exit the bank's vault at will. At first, the manager of course dismissed it as nonsense, but because the worker said it with certainty, he became suspicious. That night, he led the bank staff to open the vault door, but unexpectedly there was a strange man sitting inside!

The bank manager was shocked and asked him how he got in. The man refused to say. Later, after receiving a reward of $4,000, he said that he was originally a worker repairing ditches. One night, he found an abandoned vertical ditch pipe and felt strange, so he climbed in, but saw a ladder inside. After climbing up again, there was a small door, which he opened casually, and he walked into the vault of the Bank of England, which was then known as "the most solid in the world!"

### Disputes

— Ji Jun

I often feel that there are far too many rude and unreasonable people in this city of Shanghai. I wonder if others feel the same way. When I first arrived in Shanghai, I was surprised to hear Shanghainese people say polite things like "Thank you" and "Sorry" as soon as they opened their mouths, and I thought this was truly a land of etiquette. However, not long after I settled down in this city, I found myself witnessing quarrels and scuffles almost every day. Sometimes, just going out once, I might encounter several disputes. Upon casually examining the causes of these disputes, they often turned out to be nothing of great significance. For example: once, a pedicab collided with a bicycle, neither party admitted fault, and they started arguing and fighting; another time, a tram was moving forward at high speed when it was obstructed by a heavily loaded animal-drawn cart in front, the driver and conductor stamped their feet and cursed, and the other side retorted, so the people from the tram actually jumped down and slapped the other side across the face; another time, a pedicab carried a passenger and stopped at the intersection of Xibao Road and Qingyun Road, but the passenger refused to get out, saying that it had been agreed to go to the intersection of Shichang Road. In fact, the distance between the intersection of Xibao Road and Baochang Road was only a few dozen feet, but the two sides argued red in the face and looked like they were about to resort to violence; another time, when buying vegetables, the price was bargained down too much, and the vegetable seller also began to curse loudly; another time, a customer was eating noodles, and the price was 4,000 yuan in legal tender. The person took out ten 400-yuan notes, but the shopkeeper disliked the small denominations and refused to accept them, which also caused a great uproar; as for the disputes caused by pushing and shoving on trams or buses, they are even more common.

I myself have experienced such things several times, and each time I have taken the position of "the weaker party" to ease the severity of the situation.

Once: I was waiting for a tram, and when one finally arrived and I entered the door, I was suddenly pulled down forcefully by a hand from behind. I looked back and didn't recognize the person, but he was dragging me away unreasonably. After walking some distance, he realized he had grabbed the wrong person and quickly let go. At that moment, I was truly furious and resentful. But then I thought, he grabbed the wrong person because of his confusion, what would be the point of scolding him, hitting him, or taking him to the police station to punish him now? Thinking this way, I forgave him and did not pursue the matter further.

Another time happened just this morning. I was riding on trolleybus number 17, and the car wasn't particularly crowded, but a rather obese person was pressing against my back. I felt uncomfortable and moved my body a little, but he didn't notice. I then arched my back forcefully again, but unexpectedly, he became enraged. He shouted and yelled, shaking his whole body, saying that he wanted me to get off the bus and fight him. The whole car was alarmed, and everyone tried to persuade him with kind words, but he seemed to have gained the upper hand and became uncontrollable. At that time, I had no choice but to reason with him for a few words, but seeing that he was unreasonable, I let him rant, otherwise, this fierce fight, I don't know how many rounds it would have lasted!

The disputes mentioned above are all extremely pointless matters. Why can't everyone be a little more calm and peaceful? Why not say "Sorry" and resolve the dispute with a single word?

I have found that when a person wants something from someone else (such as making way or handing something over), they will repeatedly say "Thank you" and "Sorry"; but when they are unintentionally disturbed by someone else (such as being bumped into), they will widen their eyes and at least give the person a glare; when they disturb someone else, they will never admit their mistake or apologize, but instead act as if they are on a battlefield, ready to face the enemy. As a result, disputes arise one after another, adding a lot of chaotic excitement to society.

And broadly speaking, does the entire human race ever have a day of peace? Aren't disputes happening at every moment and in every region?

### An Impromptu Poem on the Executive Yuan Officials' Lack of Decisiveness Regarding the Adjustment of Salaries for Public School Employees

— Shi Zhecun

Your servant is hungry and about to die, the court's discussion is unsettled. How to assist the emperor's plans? The schemes are like drowning a rat. It's easy to seek skins from tigers' dens, but hard to get plain rice from the king's door. A plate of dry alfalfa, how can it be seen as minced meat?

### Passing Time

— You Mojun

Reeds and maple leaves are both heartless, urging the fleeting time towards its end. The earth has fierce battles year after year, the west wind startles the traveler's heart night after night. People should be tired after experiencing great calamities, the moon gradually dims when it reaches the end of the night. Still, it is the place where the Southern Dynasties enjoyed themselves, where does the sound of drums and mournful pipes come from?

### Fragments

The world's first icebreaker (using a screw) was built in 1837 to break ice on Canada's Delaware River. The first propeller-driven icebreaker was built in 1864 to break ice between the Russian port of Kronstadt and Oranienbaum.

American dental and obstetrical doctors often play soft music records when administering anesthetics before surgery, so that patients or mothers can gain a kind of mental peace. The two most commonly used records are: (1) Debussy's "Clair de Lune", and (2) Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata".

### Learning

In the photos of the war criminals sentenced by the Tokyo Court previously published in this newspaper, to the right of Doihara is Hata Shunroku, who also served as commander of the invading China Expeditionary Army and as their Minister of the Army. At that time, Mitsumasa Yonai was the Prime Minister and had doubts about the "German-Italian-Japanese Alliance", so the Minister of the Army resigned, and the Yonai Cabinet collapsed. (Japan's strange system is that if the Minister of the Army resigns and the military does not recommend a successor, then the cabinet must be reorganized.) The new cabinet advocated the "Axis", and Japan formally entered the vortex of World War II, until its defeat and surrender. The third person, Hirota Koki, was the Foreign Minister of the Okada Cabinet during the "February 26th Incident". Young officers rioted in Tokyo and killed many ministers, but Hirota was not only unharmed but also succeeded in forming a cabinet, which shows that this person, with the guise of a "gentle and refined" person, actually had close ties with the young officers. During his tenure as Foreign Minister, he had the so-called Three Principles towards China, and also said that "there is no word 'war' in a diplomat's dictionary", which was a phrase copied from "there is no word 'difficult' in Napoleon's dictionary". After the war, the Allied forces discovered in Japan that Hirota was an important member of the "Black Dragon Society", so the heavy sentence he received today is well-deserved.

Another piece of news from this newspaper is that the execution of the condemned criminals may take place on the 8th of next month (i.e., December 8th). If this is true, then the Pacific War was launched seven years ago on "December 8th" (December 8th, 1941), and the execution of the war criminals this year is also on "December 8th". The retribution is clear, which is enough to serve as a warning. Moreover, the Shanghai War of 1932 was also launched by the Japanese invaders, and the date was also "January 28th" (January 28th). Therefore, giving them a final reckoning on "December 8th" at the end of this year, "the net of heaven is vast, its mesh is wide, yet nothing escapes", is it not believable!

### Remembering Ding Chuwo

— Qian Dacheng

Ever since the "Old Collection of Ancient and Modern Zaju from Yishiyuan" was dispersed in 1938, it was purchased by Zheng Xidi at a high price and donated to the National Library. Sun Kaidi researched its collection history and wrote a long article of one to two hundred thousand words. It was then learned that this book had been collected by Zhao Qimei, Qian Qianyi, Qian Zeng, Li Zhenyi, He Yu, Huang Pilie, Wang Shizhong, and Zhao Zongjian, and finally dispersed from the home of Mr. Ding Chuwo. Mr. Ding's name then became widely known. However, Kaidi's research on Mr. Ding's life was not detailed. I was from the same village as Mr. Ding and attended the Ding Family Elementary School he founded in my youth, so I will recount his past events.

Mr. Chuwo's name was Zu Yin, his courtesy name was Zhizisun, and he was from Changshu. He was a Qing scholar. At the end of the Guangxu period, he advocated for the establishment of schools, and in the county, anyone who spoke of education would certainly recommend him first. His family had a beautiful garden, formerly called "Luyin". Mr. Ding renamed it "Chuyuan", which was also where he kept his books. There was a three-room building called: "Xiangsu". (Kaidi mistakenly wrote it as "Xiangsu" in his book "On the Ancient and Modern Zaju from Yishiyuan".) In 1912, he served as the head of civil affairs in the county, and later as the magistrate of the county. He was then transferred to the post of magistrate of Wujiang County, where he brought benefits wherever he went. He was the author of "Yixing Collection" and "Songling Documents". He paid attention to local historical anecdotes and published three collections of "Chushan Yikan" A, B, and C, and two editions of "Yuyang Shuoyuan". Most of the material was taken from the collection of "Tieqin Tongjianlou". In his later years, he continued to revise the county chronicles, but only the section on literary and artistic figures was published separately.

Mr. Ding was skilled in the study of autographed block prints, and his book collection was quite secretive, kept tightly closed and refused to be shown to others. After purchasing the "Ancient and Modern Zaju" from the Zhao family's "Jiushanlou", he copied its colophon and submitted it to the "Beiping Library Monthly", falsely claiming: "I saw the Yishiyuan Qu in the old Jiushanlou of the Zhao family at Hai, and once glanced through it, copying its colophon; I hurriedly returned it to the Zhao family, and now I don't know where it has gone." When the Dingchou Rebellion broke out, the book flowed out from his descendants' residence in Suzhou, and the truth was revealed to the world. Mr. Ding also collected a large number of Ji Gu Guan copied manuscripts and Huang Pupu's collated and inscribed manuscripts, and once exchanged a Tanshengtang copied manuscript with Mr. Wang Jiyu for a Mao copied manuscript.

When I was in Suzhou, I once saw in a bookstore Mr. Ding's copied and collated manuscript of Mao Zijin's "Yinhu Changhe Collection" in two volumes (lacking the lower volume), which was a forgery from the Zichuanyuan factory. There was a handwritten inscription in red ink at the end that said: "The works that Ji Gu Guan published by himself, such as Yinhu Inscriptions and Yinhu Changhe, are extremely rare; this edition was copied from the Yuan Shu edition borrowed from Chuan. The Xiaozhang Junming Bumei Collection seal is still on the first volume, which belonged to Jin Gengan of Changzhou. Gengan was also one of the poets in the Hush She. The original volume was missing the lower volume, so I will wait to search for it. There are many variant characters in the volume, so I copied them according to the old original. Summer of Bingchen, recorded by Chuwo in his residence at sea."

Mr. Ding passed away in his residence in Suzhou in the year of Renshen of the Republic. The Old Man of Yan Valley wrote a poem to mourn him, saying: "Why did you go to Gusu? You turned into a traveler. Facing danger without a word, a short separation is like a thousand springs. Secret books from Jiushan, famous gardens neighbor Jingpu. I know that when you close your eyes, there will surely be tears on your kerchief." After Mr. Ding's death, the Ding Family Elementary School was closed. Not many years later, the Dingchou Rebellion broke out, and the collection of books was completely scattered. However, Mr. Ding's name was not known outside of Jiangnan during his lifetime, but after his death, with the book "Ancient and Modern Zaju", his name has become the subject of research by scholars of bibliography and block printing. Gains and losses in life and death, fortune and misfortune, are truly difficult to say. However, this book was able to be collected by the country, which can be said to be the right place for it. Mr. Ding was able to have his name passed down for thousands of years through this book, which is ultimately fortunate.
