Our army has completed its deployment around the periphery of Kaifeng. Now, I, the Commander-in-Chief, am personally directing the battle. I hope that the entire army and civilians will closely cooperate, calmly respond to the enemy, and achieve the effect of internal and external attacks, hoping to achieve unprecedented results." Liu returned to Xuzhou at 11:00 AM.

[Our Dispatch from Kaifeng, 19th] The purpose of the Communist bandits invading Bian is to force the withdrawal of the Nationalist troops from Heze, in order to weaken the pressure of the Nationalist troops on the bandits in western Shandong. However, the bandits' attack on Bian has been frustrated. The Chen (Yi) bandits attacked the southeast corner of Kaifeng twice on the 19th, but were annihilated by the defending army. It is estimated that more than 1,500 bandits were killed and more than 120 captured. The main force of the eastern and western routes to rescue Kaifeng is advancing rapidly and should be able to relieve the siege within days.

[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 19th] The Air Force's Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Bohai Sea squadrons shuttle day and night to fly over Bian to assist the army in defending Bian. More than 200 Communist bandits entered Xiaodongmen in Bian city last night, and were all annihilated by the defending army by 3:00 PM today. (Another Dispatch) A major fire broke out in the Dongguan and Nanguan of Bian today. The war situation may change tonight or tomorrow.

[Our Dispatch from Hankou, 19th] Military News: Liu (Deng's) Third and Sixth Columns are attempting to contain our army's reinforcements to Kaifeng from moving north, and are now maneuvering southwest of Tanghe. A section of the Pinghan Railway south of Zhumadian was destroyed by bandits on the 18th. After emergency repairs, traffic is expected to resume tomorrow.

[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 19th] The remnant forces of the Chen (Yi) and Liu (Bocheng) bandits in western Shandong have been repeatedly and severely attacked by our army, suffering heavy casualties. Yesterday, they split into groups near Juye and fled south towards the areas of Dingtao, Cao County, and Kaocheng. Powerful Nationalist army groups are intercepting the bandits. The fighting is unprecedentedly fierce.

[Our Dispatch from Bengbu, 19th] Bridges No. 82 and No. 126 between Fuliji and Xisipo on the Jinpu Railway were destroyed by bandits on the morning of the 19th, and traffic was immediately interrupted.

### The Supervisory Yuan Passes a Temporary Motion to Request the President to Send Troops to Aid Bian

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] Supervisory Committee members Guo Zhongwei and 19 others from Yanji, proposed a temporary motion in the Supervisory Yuan on the 19th to "request the government to send troops to reinforce Kaifeng." It was unanimously resolved and sent to the President. The full text is as follows: "Upon investigation, the famous cities in the Central Plains are only Xu (zhou), Bian (Kaifeng), and Zheng (zhou). If Bian and Zheng are lost, Xuzhou will be isolated, and the situation in the Central Plains will be completely lost. It will be absolutely impossible to rely on the Yangtze River as a defense line. Recently, the treacherous bandits Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and others have taken advantage of the emptiness of the Kaifeng defense to concentrate more than four columns of troops to approach the suburbs of the city, and its demise is imminent. If Kaifeng is lost, southern China will be shaken, not only will these 600,000 people fall into a tragic calamity, but the capital will also be threatened, which will greatly affect the views of international figures, and the country's pacification plan will be frustrated. The future is unimaginable. It is imperative to request the government to quickly send a large army to rescue Kaifeng, and at the same time send a senior official to Zhengzhou to take charge and unify command to ensure the safety of the famous city, boost morale, and win the hearts of the people. The overall situation of the country depends on this move."

### Lei Zhen's Negotiations with the Youth Party Have Not Ended;

Shi Zhiquan Has Sent a Telegram to the Capital Expressing Acceptance of the Nomination as Vice President of the Judicial Yuan

[Report from This Newspaper] The negotiations between Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and Lei Zhen in Shanghai with the Youth Party still had no results yesterday. Zhang and Wu did not meet with the Youth Party representatives yesterday. Lei Zhen was solely responsible for the activities. Lei visited Zhang Junmai in the morning, attended a banquet hosted by Chen Qitian at noon, and participated in an internal consultation of the Youth Party on Haige Road at 4:00 PM, which ended at 8:00 PM. According to a member of the Standing Committee of the Youth Party, the resolution of the Central Standing Committee of the party is to hope that the number of Legislative Yuan members can be more than 20. If the problem of Legislative Yuan members is not resolved, they do not plan to participate in the Executive Yuan, and they do not plan to participate in the Judicial and Examination Yuans either. According to relevant sources, Zhang Qun's negotiations are aimed at both the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, but mainly at the Youth Party, because the Democratic Socialist Party's decision not to participate in the Executive Yuan cannot be changed, so they do not want to force them. In fact, there is no problem with the number of Legislative Yuan members for the Democratic Socialist Party. Lei Zhen hopes that the Youth Party will first send 10 Legislative Yuan members to attend the Legislative Yuan, and then continue to discuss other issues. Otherwise, if the situation becomes rigid again, no one will be willing to take responsibility for coordination.

According to the Central News Agency, Youth Party members reiterated the proposal that "the three parties should consult in advance when deciding on major issues related to national interests." They believe that if this principle is established, it will be a major guarantee for the continued cooperation of the three parties in the future, so they are very willing for the three parties to first discuss how to implement this principle. In addition to forwarding this opinion to Zhang Qun, Lei will return to the capital on the evening of the 20th. Zhang will stay in Shanghai for several days.

In addition, the Democratic Socialist Party held a meeting of the Central Standing Committee this afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Chen Bulei telegraphed Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Lei Zhen, and others in Shanghai today, asking them to sincerely express to friendly parties not to delay participation in various government departments due to the Legislative Yuan member issue, with the words "earnest sincerity, I hope to convey to the Youth Party friends, hoping for understanding of difficulties and early reply." It is also heard that Shi Zhiquan has telegraphed to the capital, expressing his acceptance of the nomination as Vice President of the Judicial Yuan.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] After Bai Chongxi agreed to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Central China, he visited the President several times to ask for instructions on the Central China Bandit Suppression affairs and to carry out personnel deployments.

### The Legislative Principles for the Temporary Property Tax Case Have Been Established; The Starting Point for Taxation is RMB 30,000 Based on Pre-War Property Value; Three Committee Members Are Appointed to Draft the Articles

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The Temporary Property Tax and Investigation of Powerful Families' Capital Subcommittee of the Finance and Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan met on the morning of the 19th to continue reviewing the temporary property tax case proposed by Liu Butong, with Convening Committee Member Jian Guansan presiding. Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Direct Taxation Department of the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance, was also invited to attend. After heated discussions, the following principles were decided: (1) The method of taxation combines personal jurisdiction and property jurisdiction, using the technology of finding property through people and finding people through property, depending on the situation. (2) The starting point for taxation is RMB 30,000 based on the property value in 1937, adjusted according to the price index. (3) The tax rate is progressive for both natural persons and legal persons, but legal persons engaged in production businesses are given differential treatment. The highest tax rate in Liu's original proposal of 60% should be reduced in principle. (4) The taxation procedure starts with big businessmen in large cities, and reporting and investigation should be started as soon as possible, and methods such as reporting, nomination, and informing should be adopted. The central government should form a central supervision committee composed of the Legislative, Supervisory, and Judicial Yuans, and the local government should form a local supervision committee composed of universities, middle schools, journalists' associations, public opinion institutions, and judicial organs. (5) The property of foreigners in China and the property of Chinese people abroad are all subject to taxation. So far, all the legislative principles have been established. Finally, Jian Guansan, Liu Butong, and Cui Jingbo were appointed to draft the articles of the regulations based on this, and submit them to the committee for discussion and decision, and then report the adjournment.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The procedural case for the Legislative Yuan's review of the national general budget case for the second half of 1948 has been decided.

Although the first session of the Legislative Yuan has been extended to the end of June, it will inevitably be extended again to handle this important case.

### The Currency Reform Issue is Being Studied by China and the United States; Chen Lifu Tells American Reporters in Washington

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Chen Lifu told reporters at the Chinese Embassy in the United States on the 18th that the currency reform issue related to the US aid to China plan is currently being studied and explored informally by the governments of China and the United States. Chen said that Chinese economists and financiers have long been working on ways to reform the economic situation and have formulated many currency reform plans. However, Chen pointed out that whether based on the gold standard or restoring the use of silver coins, the plan can only succeed when the situation becomes more stable. He also said: Before starting any currency reform, a certain degree of currency stability must be achieved, but this stability can only be achieved by making good use of domestic resources and property and improving the general situation. Asked whether the $125 million in military aid to China, which is being considered in parallel with the economic aid to China plan, is sufficient to suppress the communists, Chen said that this number is not small, but it is still not enough.

### The Fifth General Assembly of the Supervisory Yuan Passes the Supervisory Law Draft; It Will Be Sent to the Legislative Yuan to Request Prompt Completion of the Legislative Process

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The entire draft of the Supervisory Law was discussed, revised, and passed at the fifth meeting held by the Supervisory Yuan on the morning of the 19th, and it was immediately resolved that: "The draft of the Supervisory Law has been revised and passed, and the Yuan will send it to the Legislative Yuan, requesting that it promptly complete the legislative process so that it can exercise its powers." This fundamental law draft of the Supervisory Yuan has finally been initially completed. (The full text of the Supervisory Law draft is published on the second page).

Morning Session

The Supervisory Yuan held its fifth meeting all day today. The morning session began at 9:00 AM, chaired by Yuan President Yu Youren. The discussion began with the draft Supervisory Law passed by the plenary review committee. First, Tian Jiongjin explained the review process, and then the articles were discussed one by one. By the time the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM, only the four articles of the first chapter, General Principles, had been passed, because two points caused heated debate. One was whether the power of correction should be included in the Supervisory Law. First, Committee Member Zhang Weihan believed that the constitution did not make a clear provision for the power of correction, so it should not be included in the supervisory power. Some people believed that although the constitution did not explicitly stipulate it, it was certain that there was a power of correction within the supervisory power, or it was possible that there was a loophole in the constitution. During the vote, those who advocated maintaining the original proposal still had more. Secondly, when discussing the Executive Office of the Supervisory Committee, some people proposed the necessity of establishing Executive Offices of the Supervisory Committee overseas. After a longer period of discussion, it was still passed according to the original draft.

Afternoon Session

The afternoon session continued at 3:30 PM, first chaired by Yu Youren. After the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM, Yu retired in advance. At this time, Vice President Liu Zhe was also absent due to business. Tian Jiongjin was publicly elected to preside over the meeting. In the afternoon's discussion, the focus was still on adding the establishment of Executive Offices of the Supervisory Committee overseas to Article 5. Many speakers, mostly in terms of emotion and reason, supported the establishment of Executive Offices overseas, but few supported it in terms of law and reason. The discussion was then decided to be carried out by resolution, and the resolution was as follows: "After this case has completed the legislative process by the Legislative Yuan, regarding the implementation of Article 5, it is planned to ask the government to allocate funds and send personnel to inspect foreign countries as soon as possible." This is to supplement the intention to establish Executive Offices overseas. After Article 5 and its resolution were passed, the progress was extremely smooth, and only a few revisions were encountered in the chapter on "Investigation," which were discussed for a long time. Also, when discussing the chapter on "Power of Correction," the original article specified the designated investigation target as "the work and facilities of the Executive Yuan and its subordinate agencies at all levels." Some committee members believed that the target was too small, inevitably causing institutions outside this scope to be omitted from the law, and firmly advocated adding the Judicial and Examination Yuans outside the Executive Yuan to expand the target and scope of the exercise of the power of impeachment. However, they ultimately failed to pass due to receiving a small number of votes during the vote. The meeting ended at 7:00 PM.

### Zhu Jiahua Flies to Jinan for Inspection

### The Special Envoy Returns to the Capital Today; Yesterday, He Attended the Qingdao Alumni Meeting and Went Swimming in the Sea

[Our Dispatch from Qingdao, 19th] The special envoy is staying at the official residence of Bail in Qingdao and is not receiving guests. Yesterday, he and Mr. and Mrs. Bail drove around the city. Today, he attended the Yenching University Alumni Welcome Meeting, and teachers and students exchanged greetings. In the afternoon, he went swimming in the sea.

### Allowing American Aid Ships to Sail to Jinghan is Not Opening Up Inland Water Navigation Rights; A Diplomatic Figure Makes a Statement on Legal Principles; Jiujiang May Also Be Granted Special Permission for American Ships to Enter and Exit

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] A reporter recently asked a diplomatic figure whether Nanjing and Hankou will be opened as inland river ports to facilitate the transportation of American aid supplies, allowing American ships to navigate the Yangtze River to unload or load cargo at the two ports. He replied: This special permission is not what is called "opening up inland water navigation rights." Inland water and coastal navigation rights refer to foreign ships navigating between inland river or coastal ports in our country to load or unload cargo. If a foreign ship sails to our country, unloads part of its cargo at any port or territorial waters open to foreign trade and navigation, and then transports the remaining cargo to any of the above-mentioned ports and territorial waters; or loads cargo in the same way at any of the above-mentioned ports and territorial waters upon departure, from a legal point of view, it cannot be regarded as "opening up inland river or coastal navigation rights." This situation is recorded very clearly in Article 24 of the Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, and it is not allowed for anyone to distort it to damage the government's prestige. After the victory, the transportation of UNRRA relief supplies was also granted special permission by our government, allowing foreign ships carrying relief supplies to directly enter designated ports along the Yangtze River to unload and load cargo. Now, in order to facilitate the transport of American aid supplies and to reduce the expensive labor costs of transshipment and the loss of time and supplies, it is proper to take short-term measures by means of special permission. Under these circumstances, it is not only necessary to open the ports of Jinghan, but also Jiujiang may be the port for American aid ships to enter and unload cargo and for inland products to be exported and loaded onto ships. However, he declined to reveal whether this measure will be included in the bilateral agreement between China and the United States regarding the implementation of the aid to China plan, but said that it would be more convenient not to include it than to include it.

### The Stillman Investigation Team Leaves Hankou for Zhuzhou for Inspection

### Hong Kong Does Not Comply with Anti-Smuggling Agreement; We Will Make Demands to Change Hong Kong's Status

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] An absolutely reliable government source told the United Press on the 19th that China feels Hong Kong is not complying with the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement. Therefore, if Chinese funds continue to flow out illegally, China may demand a change in Hong Kong's status in the short term. China and Hong Kong concluded a treaty in Nanjing a few months ago to jointly prevent smuggling. However, Chinese funds are still flowing out to Hong Kong, especially from Shanghai and Guangdong, which China considers "smuggling" in violation of the agreement. The Chinese economy has two major incurable diseases: one is the outflow of idle capital from North China to Shanghai, and the other is the rush of idle capital from Shanghai and Guangdong into Hong Kong. The Chinese government believes that this will "drain China's lifeblood," but the Hong Kong authorities have not made sufficient efforts to cooperate and stop it. The Chinese government knows that a direct request to take back Hong Kong might be immediately rejected by Britain. Subsequently, China might submit the matter to the United Nations, but this is unlikely to succeed, as Britain can be expected to control enough votes to veto China's request.

Authoritative sources point out that due to increasing pressure from public opinion, especially from the business community, China will demand representation in the Hong Kong government with sufficient power to stop smuggling. "Of course, the concentration of idle capital is beneficial to Hong Kong, but we feel that the Hong Kong government should comply with the anti-smuggling agreement in both letter and spirit, and we should strengthen cooperation on matters of mutual concern to China."

### Reorganizing Morality and Promoting Our National Culture

— Fan Guang

Dr. Brookman of the United States initiated a grand gathering, the "John Hay Fellowship" commencing June 3rd in Los Angeles, with participants from over thirty countries worldwide. Our nation was also represented by Vice President Chen of the Legislative Yuan. This indeed offers a major turning point to stem the tide and salvage this immense disaster. The basis of this undertaking lies in the culmination of several millennia of ethical and moral civilization in our nation. Since Westernization permeated the East, people embraced European values, prioritizing profit and seeking quick success. Yet, a conference dedicated to reorganizing morality originated among people of the United States, a land with extremely advanced material civilization. They understood the source of the problem. It also shows the depth of their academic research, enabling them to trace back to the source and find the true foundation.

Since the dawn of our culture, China has promoted morality, regarding it as the goal of learning, the means to cultivate oneself, the foundation for regulating the family, and the basis for governing the state. For millennia, this has been nurtured and grown, permeating the entire nation and becoming the essence of our national heritage. 道 (Dao) and 德 (De) are two different aspects: Dao is the natural order of things in daily life, while 德 (De) is the cultivation of Dao, resulting in inner attainment. The Zhou Shu states, "Dao encompasses talent, while 德 (De) enables personal practice." Lao Tzu said, "Dao gives birth to it, and 德 (De) nurtures it. Therefore, all things respect Dao and value 德 (De)." The Great Learning states, "The Way of Great Learning consists in manifesting the clear virtue." Mencius said, "When the world is governed by Dao, minor virtues serve greater virtues." He also said, "To subdue people with 德 (De) is to win their hearts and sincere submission." The Analects states, "Guide them by government decrees and regulate them by punishments, and the people will avoid wrongdoing but have no sense of shame. Guide them by virtue and regulate them by ritual, and they will have a sense of shame and also reform themselves." This kind of morality is the highest philosophy for seeking peace and stability in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad.

Since the world abandoned Dao, lost sight of morality, and prioritized profit, it opened the door to opportunities for killing, leading to endless wars and chaos. Mencius said, "When those above and those below compete for profit, the nation is in danger." Today, the world competes for profit; how can the world not be in danger! It is fitting to echo Mencius's words to King Hui of Liang, saying, "Let there be benevolence and righteousness; why must you speak of profit?" If we can truly revive morality and implement the four principles advocated by the conference—honesty, selflessness, impartiality, and universal love—and further expand and enrich them, with individuals relying on them as their guide and nations using them as the basis for governance, then the pursuit of profit will be curbed, and the world will be stable. However, politics is rooted in civilization. Today, the world's civilization is a grand trend of both material and spiritual aspects. Western civilization focuses solely on developing material aspects. Our civilization, in ancient times, originally developed both spiritual and material aspects. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, numerous schools of thought emerged, discussing both vertical and horizontal strategies. Material inventions also reached their peak. Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor, sought to establish a dynasty for ten thousand generations. Material civilization easily makes one forget one's country, so he suppressed scholars and forged alliances. Material civilization flowed from Asia Minor to the West. Thus, the West has developed material civilization for generations, reaching its peak today. However, the monarchs of our country throughout history have imitated Qin Shi Huang's old tricks, confining the people and deceiving the masses, regarding material things as inferior learning and despising them as ingenious skills. Thus, we have only maintained our spiritual civilization. Since the opening of the sea ban at the end of the Qing Dynasty, we have realized the inadequacy of our material civilization to cope with the situation. So we competed to open schools and send students abroad to absorb material knowledge. Meanwhile, Western scholars have gradually come into contact with our culture. Those who have studied it deeply have come to understand the profundity and greatness of our national spiritual civilization.

In books and arguments, it is often said that if one wants to seek true peace and happiness in other parts of the world, one must seek guidance from Chinese culture. Since the West primarily focuses on material things, it emphasizes profit, and its recent theories, such as survival of the fittest and the strong preying on the weak, all promote contention. The world's material resources are limited, but human desires are infinite. Once dissatisfied, people will fight with each other, and nations will fight with each other. The disaster for humanity will be great. However, our spiritual culture for thousands of years has been purely focused on cultivating virtue, practicing benevolence and righteousness, and seeking only spiritual satisfaction, not material things. Confucius said, "If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die content in the evening." He also said, "The noble man concerns himself with the Way, not with food." Yan Hui lived in a humble lane, eating from a bamboo bowl and sleeping with his arm as a pillow, which others could not bear, but Yan Hui did not change his joy. Yuan Xian lived in a small room with a wobbly door, using a broken window as a pillow, but he did not consider it a hardship. When Zilu was offered the position of prime minister, he declined. When Chu offered him a position as a minister, he also declined, preferring to be poor rather than compromise his integrity. When the King of Chu offered him gold and silk, his wife left him, but his health improved day by day. They all knew to believe in Dao, cultivate virtue, seek spiritual peace, and despise material things, not considering them important. Therefore, they did not contend with others. Zhao Pu governed the world with half of the Analects, but in reality, his knowledge was shallow; he had not yet heard of the Way of the noble man. The first chapter of the Great Learning states, "The Way of Great Learning consists in manifesting the clear virtue, in renovating the people, and in resting in the highest excellence." Its actions are to investigate things, extend knowledge, make the will sincere, rectify the heart, cultivate the self, regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world. Just this one chapter is enough to govern the world. The so-called cultivation of the self is the practice of Dao and humility. To govern the state and pacify the world is to assimilate one's own destiny to the nation and the world.

The reason why 道 (Dao) allows easy governance is because 道 (Dao) and concession are inherent in people. The governors only need to guide the people to assimilate, and they will naturally assist each other. In our history, countless foreign races have invaded our borders, but they were soon assimilated by us. Throughout history, the Five Barbarians caused chaos, the Turks invaded, the Khitans brought disaster to Jin, the Jurchens destroyed Song, and the Yuan Dynasty ruled. Before long, they were all assimilated by us and their races perished. The Qing people replaced the Ming Dynasty, ruling the country for three hundred years, but today the Manchus have been assimilated. Our ethical civilization is highly influential and has great assimilative power. Those who are exposed to it are naturally assimilated into this great melting pot. Now that we need to absorb material civilization, and the West feels the need for our culture, the 20th century is truly a grand meeting of the two major civilizations of the world. We should seize this good opportunity, ride the tide, and promote our Chinese culture to the world so that everyone can rectify their hearts and cultivate themselves, and every family can be regulated, and every state can be governed. The world of Great Harmony described by Confucius can be realized. With uniform writing, uniform laws, and uniform ethics, the world will be one family. What need is there for contention? Therefore, the day the world accepts our culture is the day true peace will be realized. And humanity can be saved and enjoy the ideal happiness of life.

In short, cultivating 道 (Dao) is the essential foundation for cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, pacifying the world, and achieving the Great Harmony. Therefore, in today's chaotic world where human desires run rampant, reorganizing morality is a great hope for addressing current issues and saving the world from imminent danger. However, those who are accustomed to material civilization will only have occasional inspiration. Guiding and directing the effort and helping to bring about recovery depends on us who are familiar with this 道 (Dao). Therefore, I believe that we should seize the opportunity, and immediately organize a Central Culture Institute to promote our national culture to the world as a major new policy to save the country, save the people, and save the world. At the same time, we should respond to the Americans' proposal and quickly organize a Chinese Association for the Reorganization of Morality in our country to echo them and leverage their efforts. Furthermore, our representatives should advocate making the association a permanent organization to guide the reorganization of morality. This is a good opportunity to promote our nation's spiritual culture to the world. We must not miss it. I hope that there are many wise people both in and out of government who will not dismiss these words.

(2) Allocate the 200 billion based on the severity of the disaster in each county. (3) The loan should be used only for the purchase of seeds, fertilizer, cattle, farm implements, and small-scale water conservancy projects such as repairing enclosures and drainage. (4) The loan should be limited to farmers' organizations. (5) The interest rate is 7.6% per month. Agricultural loan personnel should be assigned immediately and may request the addition of temporary employees as needed to expedite the work.

### Taiwan's Power Supply Plan

To Be Submitted to U.S. Aid Technical Mission

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 19th] The western Taiwan power supply system is now capable of generating 130,000 kilowatts, not far from the peak of 150,000 kilowatts during the Japanese occupation. However, this power is only sufficient to meet the needs of existing factories. Military industries such as aluminum production cannot be supplied. Manufacturers from Shanghai, Tianjin, Peiping, and other inland areas hope to establish various consumer chemical industries in Taiwan and are clamoring for power. According to Huang Chan, assistant manager of the Taiwan Power Company, the current power demand has reached 50,000 kilowatts. The Taiwan Provincial Government has decided to increase power generation by 100,000 kilowatts within three years, completing the Taileng, Wulan, Wushe, and San power plants, at an estimated cost of US$6 million. A plan has been drafted and is ready for reference by the upcoming U.S. Aid Technical Survey Mission, and hopes are high.

### West Germany Implements Currency Reform, Soviet Union Takes Countermeasures, Orders Blockade of Railway and Highway Traffic, Declares Division of Germany Completed

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] The Soviet authorities in Germany have issued a declaration signed by Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet forces, announcing that the unilateral implementation of currency reform in West Germany by the Western Allies has completed the division of Germany. Simultaneously with this declaration, the Soviet military government ordered the prohibition of trains, highways, passenger transport, and pedestrians from entering the Soviet occupation zone from West Germany, as well as the prohibition of new [currency] from being imported into the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet military government clarified that this new order does not affect air traffic, and although freight transport by rail and canal is not prohibited, it will be subject to stricter supervision. Telephone and postal services between West Germany and the Soviet occupation zone are also not affected. However, the declaration also stated that other measures will be taken at any time as the situation requires. Sokolovsky's declaration not only announced the completion of the division of East and West Germany but also stated that the existence of two German currencies within Germany would make domestic trade relations, as well as trade between the West and the Soviet occupation zone, practically equivalent to trade between two countries. The full text of Marshal Sokolovsky's declaration reads: "The unilateral implementation of currency reform by the Western countries is contrary to the will and interests of the German people and is only implemented for the benefit of the monopolistic capitalists of the United States, Britain, and France. The unilateral implementation of currency reform has completed the division of Germany and has clearly violated the Potsdam Agreement and the Allied Control Agreement for Germany, which stipulate that Germany should be regarded as an economic unit. The Western powers, using the impossibility of agreeing on a four-power currency reform for the whole of Germany as an excuse to justify their unilateral actions, are implementing their policy of dividing Germany with the support of the American, British, and French monopolistic capitalists, who once supported fascism and initiated World War II, and the large German capitalists. The unilateral currency reform strengthens the political and economic position of these reactionaries and only harms the working class."

### East Germany Postpones Currency Reform, Decisions Dependent on West Germany's Situation, Soviet Representative Refuses to Attend Joint Command Meeting

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 19th Broadcasting: Berlin News, it is reported that the Soviet military commander in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany has accepted the opinion of the German Economic Commission in the Soviet occupation zone, that the currency reform in East Germany will be postponed pending clarification of the status of Berlin. According to Soviet officials, the Soviet side is unwilling to act alone in reforming the currency in East Germany and must cooperate with the responsible German parties.

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] The Soviet side has already stated that it cannot attend the special meeting of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command (Four-Power Berlin Military Government) to be held on the 19th to consider currency reform. The Soviet military commander in Berlin, Yelisarov, sent a letter to General Garnaud of France, the chairman of the current meeting of the Joint Command, expressing his regret for his inability to attend the meeting.

He also stated that the Soviet occupation authorities had already stated their views on the issue of currency reform. According to the Berlin radio station controlled by the Soviet Union, the British military government chief has flatly rejected Sokolovsky's welcome to the four powers to jointly reform the currency.

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] The German People's Congress, regarded as the "shadow cabinet" of the future East German government, held an emergency meeting at noon on the 19th in the Soviet zone of Berlin. The Berlin City Council is also scheduled to hold a special meeting on Monday to discuss the situation caused by the implementation of currency reform in West Germany. The German Economic Commission in the Soviet zone was summoned to Sokolovsky's headquarters at midnight on the 18th for a meeting. Afterwards, a commissioner claimed, "We will continue to strive to maintain the appearance of German unity by continuing trade between East and West." According to reliable sources, because the currency reform in West Germany does not include Berlin, activities between districts in Berlin will not be restricted for the time being before the Soviet Union announces its decision on currency reform in East Germany.

### West Germany Supervises Implementation of New Economic Plan

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 18th] Bennett, the chief financial advisor to the U.S. military government, said that it is now too late to discuss a four-power joint currency reform, but he still hopes to restore trade relations with the Soviet zone soon. He expects a large number of unemployment to occur in West Germany within six months after the implementation of currency reform. The German side's reaction is that although they feel that currency reform is an unpleasant move, it is also a necessary measure. According to Frankfurt Radio, the West German police will supervise the smooth implementation of the currency reform plan, and interference will be imposed on shops that refuse to sell goods. A telegram from Düsseldorf said that holders of old currency are eager to get rid of it and are willing to pay a high price of 3,000 marks (equivalent to £75) to buy a pound of coffee. The black market price of British and American cigarettes is 40 marks, equivalent to £1.

### No Impact on Salaried Class, Speculators Hit Hardest

[United Press, London, 18th] British economist Webb gave a speech to the German people tonight, saying, "The currency reform law has been carefully considered to ensure that the burden is fair. The new law protects civilians and will not tolerate wartime speculators." The initial phenomenon of currency reform in West Germany is that the general salaried class has little savings on weekdays, and the losses are not large. The middle class's deposits have suffered significant losses, and those who depend on savings or interest for a living may have to look for work. The wealthy class is prone to bankruptcy, especially wartime profits. Black market traders have no way out in the future. If they do not burn their banknotes, they can only find a way to explain the source of income to the authorities.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 19th] British financial experts claim that the good results of currency reform in West Germany depend on the sufficient supply of materials under the Marshall Aid Plan and the announcement of a new tax system after the reform. The new tax system will benefit the poorer classes in Germany. Without these two factors, the currency reform in West Germany will be the most painful currency reform for the people in post-war Europe.

### President Truman Submits Report on Aid to Greece and Turkey to Congress, Greek Government Forces Launch General Offensive Against Guerrillas

[United Press, Washington, 18th] President Truman submitted a report on aid to Greece and Turkey for the past thirteen months to Congress today, stating that the situation in Greece is still precarious. Inflation and widespread refugees continue to hinder the country's economic recovery. However, the morale of the Greek government forces has been boosted, and the organization has been improved, making it possible to turn defense into offense and effectively improve the situation.

[United Press, Athens, 19th] The Greek government forces launched the largest offensive against the guerrillas yesterday. Under the cover of aircraft and artillery, they have gained new positions at the foot of Mount Grammos in the north-central region, where the guerrilla headquarters are located.

### Tensions High on Border Between U.S. and Soviet Occupation Zones, British Armored Vehicles Deployed

[United Press, Helmstedt, 19th] The British army dispatched ten armored vehicles to this area today, while the Soviet authorities drove back hundreds of travelers trying to enter Berlin. The British move was due to rumors that the Soviet army had sent tanks to the border of the U.S. occupation zone.

### Poland Protests West German Agreement to U.S. Government

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Poland yesterday protested to the United States against the decision of the Western countries to establish a West German government, believing that the London Six-Power Agreement violated the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements. The note was delivered by Polish Ambassador Winiewicz to U.S. Undersecretary of State Armor. Winiewicz later told reporters that the Six-Power Agreement gave Germany the right to recover before its neighboring countries that had suffered from the ravages of war, and disregarded Poland's views on the German issue, which Poland could not recognize.

### Danube River Conference

Soviet Union Agrees to Hold in Belgrade

[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 19th Broadcasting: Washington News, the Soviet Union recently sent a note to the U.S. State Department, stating that the Danube River Ten-Nation Conference can be held in the capital of Yugoslavia on July 30. The previous rumor that the Soviet Union advocated holding the conference in another Danube River city was a misunderstanding.

After coming to Shanghai, she changed her name to Wang Ying and danced at the Paramount. She then became active in social circles with her close friends because they were like-minded. Her father, Ren Xuequan, worked under Lu Bohong and also worked for the Shanghai Datong Dada Shipping Company for a time. He recently retired due to his age and lives with his daughter and a maid at No. 58 Tianjiafang, Xiqiao Street. Ren also has a younger brother named Liansheng who is studying at the Suzhou Academy of Fine Arts. On the 18th, Ren suddenly had a quarrel with her father for unknown reasons, and went out at 6:00 PM with her cousin, Miss Dongbao. At 11:30 PM, they passed the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. Ren entered the hotel because her close friend, Su Xuan, lived in Room 525 on the fifth floor of the hotel. She also checked into Room 408 under the name of Wang Ying. That night, she summoned Su to her room to pour out her grievances and revealed that she was tired of life. After Su persuaded her in many ways, she took Miss Dongbao to bed on the fifth floor, leaving Ren alone in the room. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM yesterday, when Su went downstairs and knocked on the door, there was no sound inside, and the door was locked by Ren. She quickly called the servant to find a way to open the door, and saw Ren lying on the bed in a printed silk cheongsam, unconscious. There was an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the table. Knowing that she had taken poison, she called an ambulance to send Ren to Gongji Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, she was sent to Ward CM14 on the third floor. It was found that Ren's pupils had shrunk. She was given acupuncture and medicine to induce vomiting and diarrhea. Although the situation improved slightly, she was still unable to speak and has not yet been pulled from danger.

Before the incident, it was heard that Ren had left a suicide note, but the contents are unknown. Her father said that it was because the house she lived in at Tianlefang had recently been taken over by a second landlord, who intended to force them to move out, but due to economic hardship, they had nowhere to find a house, which caused Ren to repeatedly clash with the second landlord and led to this desperate measure.

Chen Lifu's Famous Work "The Principles of Life" to be Published in English in the United States; Professor Pound Highly Praises It

[Our Dispatch] Chen Lifu, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, has a profound understanding of philosophy. His book "The Principles of Life," published in August 1944, has sold 250,000 copies since its release. Prominent figures in the philosophical community, such as Xiong Shili and Liu Yimo, have given the book high praise. The book has now been translated into English by Ren Taimin, a Ph.D. from Harvard University and Dean of Academic Affairs at Guizhou University, who received a prize from the French Academy for his translation of the "Book of Han". The english title will be *Philosophy of Life*, to be published by the Philosophical Library in New York and is scheduled for release soon. It is predicted that the publication of this book in the United States will have a significant and beneficial impact on mutual understanding and cultural exchange between Eastern and Western peoples.

Further, Professor Roscoe Pound, former Dean of the Harvard Law School and current consultant to our Ministry of Justice, originally studied philosophy and has been immersed in philosophical research for decades. He has read this book in detail and expressed high praise, writing a long preface, pointing out that Chen Lifu takes "cooperation and coexistence," "unity and mutual assistance," and "collective evolution" as the center of culture, advocating that the highest purpose of life is coordination and cooperation among all peoples of the world. Chen's book provides a new assessment of how China's future civilization, the progress of humanity, and world peace will ultimately contribute to this goal. Chen's book will allow Westerners to understand the basic concepts of Chinese culture and will greatly contribute to the understanding of Chinese civilization. This understanding is essential before lofty plans for international organizations (a coordinated world order) can take effect.

### 世運發揮威力　仁餘遭逢慘敗　七十比卅四形勢一面倒
The World Games Team Displays Power, Renyu Suffers a Crushing Defeat: A One-Sided Score of 70 to 34

[Our Dispatch] Last night, the World Games basketball team reversed its listless performance in the first game, displaying unparalleled power and inflicting a severe defeat on Feng Renyu. The final score was 70 to 34, with the halftime score at 27 to 14. The players performed exceptionally well, reaching the peak of their abilities, and their coordination was perfect. Li Shiqiao's passing, dribbling, and shooting were particularly impressive, scoring 23 points and captivating the audience. Renyu initially had a 10-0 lead, but lacking sufficient maturity and experience, they became flustered when the World Games team fought back, foreshadowing their defeat. Frequent loopholes in their defense and the failure of Wu Xin's accurate shooting allowed the World Games team, with their sharp attacks, to create a one-sided situation.

The Golden Age of Renyu

The game started at 8:00 p.m., with Wu Zibin and Zhu Mingxing as referees. The World Games team started with Li Zhenzhong and Huang Tianxi (guards), Cai Wenhua (center), and Li Shiqiao and Yu Ruizhang (forwards). Renyu countered with Le Jiazhou and Xu Zhongyi (guards), Yao Wenyi (center), and Shen Pengju and Shen Guozheng (forwards). Xu Zhongyi scored first with a free throw, opening the scoring. Yao Wenyi dribbled in, making it 3-0. The World Games team called a timeout, replacing Yu Ruizhang with Wu Chengzhang. Le Jiazhou scored on a shot and a free throw, and Shen Pengju added another point, giving Renyu a 10-0 lead, marking the golden age of Renyu.

The World Games Team Comes from Behind

Five minutes into the game, Huang Tianxi scored a long shot, breaking the World Games team's scoreless streak. Then, Shiqiao scored with one hand. Renyu called a second timeout, but failed to stop the World Games team's momentum. Shiqiao scored twice under the basket, Da Li scored on a free throw, and A Di dribbled in, reversing the score to 12-11. Renyu's formation wavered, and they were in disarray. Although Xu Zhongyi was brought in to replace Wu Xin, there was no improvement. On the other hand, the World Games team, with Zhenzhong and Wenhua, scored repeatedly. Shiqiao's long shots and steals were accurate. Renyu only had one "air ball" from Xiao Wu. The first half ended with the World Games team leading 27-14, coming from behind.

Shiqiao is Very Active

The whistle blew again. Da Li and A Di of the World Games team were tired, and A Bao and Xiao Yu came in as replacements. Xu Zhongyi of Renyu re-entered the game. After the jump ball, Wenhua added five points with a shot and a free throw. A Bao added another point, and Renyu called another timeout. Yao Wenyi was substituted, and Wenhua continued to score frequently. Li Shiqiao entered and exited Renyu's restricted area, grabbing every opportunity. Renyu had no way to resist. After the score became 61-29, Bao Songyuan was fouled out, and Da Li re-entered. Xiao Wu of Renyu was also fouled out and replaced by Zhuang Yi. Shiqiao was still very active, and his agile skills won applause from the entire audience. When Qian Ruizhang added another four points, time had run out, and the World Games team triumphantly won with a score of 70-34.

First Half: World Games 27, Renyu 14

Second Half: World Games 43, Renyu 20

### 現階段的　心理衛生運動
The Mental Hygiene Movement at its Current Stage

— Huang Jiayin

The mental hygiene movement originated in the United States and has been underway for exactly thirty years. When C.W. Beers, who had suffered from mental illness, the psychologist William James, and the psychiatrist Adolf Meyer founded the Connecticut Society for Mental Hygiene, they never imagined that in just thirty years, the mental hygiene movement would become a flourishing and widespread movement throughout the world. They even less imagined that mental hygiene would become a specialized course and field of study.

The Chinese Mental Hygiene Association had an organization before the War of Resistance, and after the victory, it reorganized in Nanjing last November, holding its first annual meeting in ten years. The Chongqing Mental Hygiene Association has recently been established, and the Shanghai Mental Hygiene Association is scheduled to hold its general membership meeting today, hoping to contribute some practical work in the future.

Initially, the goal of the mental hygiene movement was limited to preventing mental illness and improving the treatment of the mentally ill. Later, it gradually expanded to the promotion and maintenance of mental health, but at best, it was only considered a tool for personal cultivation. Later, with the development of psychiatry and child psychology, people realized that a person's mental health is based on early childhood. Thus, mental hygiene became closely related to child rearing and school education. In recent years, the medical community has discovered that a person's body and mind, physiology and psychology, are not only closely related, but also inseparable. Therefore, a new discipline called "Psychosomatic medicine" was created, which officially linked mental hygiene with medicine.

From August 16 to 21 this year, the International Mental Hygiene Conference, sponsored by the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Health Organization, will hold its third global meeting in Central Hall, London. The agenda of this conference will not only cover personal mental hygiene, but also family, industrial, and social mental hygiene. The main topic, however, will be "the problem of good relations between world citizens and nations." Therefore, the mental hygiene movement at its current stage is already an important movement related to international goodwill and world peace. The future mental hygiene movement will focus on the relationship between personal cultivation, social stability, and world peace. The mental hygiene movement has embarked on a broad road!

### Rhetoric and Realism

— Jinjin

Those who emphasize rhetoric in writing often labor meticulously over each word and phrase. Translators share this sentiment. If the wording is inappropriate, it's like scratching an itch through a boot, causing the translator to feel an unbearable frustration. Once, I encountered the sentence "I bad done a good and noble deed." Initially, I translated it as "我已經做了一件高貴的好事 (I have already done a noble good deed)," but I felt the tone was forced. Later, I revised it to "我已經做了一件動機純正的好事 (I have already done a good deed with pure motives)," which flowed better but still didn't feel right. I had no choice but to wait for another day to find more appropriate words and revise it again.

The extreme of overemphasizing rhetoric leads to empty embellishment. Let's not even mention anything else, taking "Wen Xin Diao Long" (文心雕龍) as an example. This is a masterpiece in the history of Chinese literary criticism. Although the praises within it are sonorous, the same meaning is explained with repetitious sentences. Its merit probably lies in a sense of neat antithetical beauty. Let's take one section of "Ding Shi" (定勢) from that book:

"夫情致異區，文變殊術，莫不因情立體，即體成勢也。勢者乘利而爲制也，如機發矢直，澗曲湍回，自然之趣也。圓者規體，其勢也自轉；方者矩形，其勢也自安。文章體勢，如斯而已，是以模經爲式者，自入典雅之　，效騷命篇者，必歸豔逸之華，綜意淺切者，類乏蘊藉；斷辭辨約者，率乘繁縟。譬激水不漪，槁木無陰，自然之勢也。 (Different emotional states lead to different literary styles. All styles take shape based on emotion, and form develops into momentum. Momentum is the mastery of advantageous situations. It is like an arrow shot from a machine, straight and swift, or a stream winding through a valley, naturally flowing. A circle follows its form and rotates naturally; a square follows its shape and sits stable. The form and momentum of writing are simply like this. Therefore, those who model their writing after the classics enter the realm of elegance; those who emulate the "Li Sao" style must return to the splendor of extravagance. Those with shallow and concise meanings tend to lack depth; those with decisive and succinct phrasing often fall into excessive elaboration. It is like turbulent water without ripples or a withered tree without shade, a natural outcome.)"

In this section, phrases like "機發矢直 (an arrow shot from a machine)", "　曲湍回 (stream winding through a valley)", "圓者規體，其勢也自轉 (a circle follows its form and rotates naturally)", "方者矩形，其勢也自安 (a square follows its shape and sits stable)", and "激水不漪，槁木無陰 (turbulent water without ripples or a withered tree without shade)" express similar meanings, bordering on redundancy. Its main point is simply to explain that writing should follow the natural flow and avoid artificiality.

Realism, on the other hand, is the opposite of embellishment. It doesn't pursue the beauty of wording but focuses on the details of facts. I once heard a relative from the countryside tell me a true story about a woman killed for adultery, which I found quite different from those who labor over words. I will retell it here as an example of realism. If the reader finds it worth reading, it is because the relative experienced it firsthand and was able to depict it vividly.

It goes that four or five years ago, next door to my relative in the countryside lived a woman who had an affair with a military officer stationed there. Later, she began associating with another man. The officer heard about it and repeatedly warned her, but she ignored him. One day at noon, my relative was eating when suddenly a quarrel broke out next door. Then, they heard the woman scream "Good brother!" as the officer stabbed her throat with a sharp knife. Soon, all was silent. Moments later, the officer, covered in blood and with a murderous look on his face, rushed out of the house. The pedestrians on the street, seeing his fierce and terrifying appearance, dared not stop him. He headed straight for the bus station and reportedly fled to Hankou. He has never been caught, escaping scot-free.

The woman's cry of "Good brother!" and the officer's escape are not easily imagined without having witnessed them firsthand. Therefore, in my humble opinion, it is better to pay attention to accuracy than to overemphasize embellishment, and it is better to put effort into realism than to focus solely on accuracy. For narrative and expressive writing, only by depicting things realistically, revealing true emotions, and evoking resonance in the reader can one create truly first-rate writing.

### The Way to Make Money

— Ruyi

In 1865, a new theater opened in Chicago, USA, but business was bad, and it looked like it would have to close down.

But the theater owner, Mr. Crospey, was a very shrewd businessman. Seeing that things were not going well, he had a flash of inspiration and announced that the theater would be raffled off. He sold 185,000 tickets at five dollars each. When the lottery ceremony was held publicly, the whole country was shocked. Crospey remained unfazed and bought back the theater from the lucky winner for $200,000. By this time, the theater had become quite famous due to the lottery, and curious spectators flocked to it. As a result, business was booming, and Crospey made a fortune overnight, becoming a plump and wealthy man.

### Various Temples

— Zheng Yimei

Gods without Temples - The two stone figures at the intersection of Ma Huo Road in the city were originally within the racecourse. Later, Westerners built houses and moved them as decorations. Unexpectedly, pious men and women flocked to burn incense and worship, and even erected a plaque, worshiping them as gods. However, the gods have no physical shelter, so they can be said to be gods without temples.

Temples with Gods - The Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road is also the Baoan Situ Temple. Every year at the beginning of the year, those in the entertainment industry often compete to burn the first incense before dawn, to pray for prosperous business. Wu Youru drew a picture to record this custom, which has a long history. There are countless temples with gods in this city, and the Rainbow Temple is one of the representatives.

Temples without Gods - There is a Flower God Temple on Hubei Manufacturing Bureau Road, which enshrines the Twelve Flower Gods, who are worshipped by people in the flower and tree industry. The main hall of the temple was suddenly burned down the previous year. All the so-called Twelve Flower Gods were scorched and blackened, so they were directly removed, leaving no trace. It has not been repaired to this day, and the side rooms of the temple have been converted into a school for students to study.

Neither Temples nor Gods - There was originally a Futian Nunnery in Nandou, which was a huge temple with flourishing incense. Unexpectedly, the abbot was suddenly moved by a lot of money and sold the temple buildings to others, sending the statues of the gods elsewhere. Thus, there was not only no temple, but also no god.

Old Temples and Old Gods - The Shanghai City God Temple enshrines the philosopher Qin Jingrong, starting in the 29th year of the Yuan Dynasty. However, the address was in the present-day Danjing Temple. During the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, it was moved to the city by magistrate Zhang Shouyue, who converted the Huo Guang Shrine built by Sun Hao of the Eastern Wu Dynasty during the Three Kingdoms period. The antiquity of its age is clear. Today, everyone, regardless of whether they are women or children, calls it the Old City God Temple. This is an old temple with old gods.

New Temples and New Gods - Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, traffic between the city and the outside world has been cut off. Those who were sheltering in foreign concessions found it very inconvenient to burn incense at the City God Temple. Therefore, speculators built a new City God Temple on Danshui Road, sculpting statues and building a temple, creating a completely new look. Thus, it was called the New City God Temple. This is a new temple with new gods.

### Roosevelt's Hobbies

— Bronze Camel

Everyone knows that the late President Roosevelt was a politician and strategist, but few know that he was also a great collector. Some people think that Roosevelt collected mostly stamps and naval books, but in fact, there are no fewer than twenty different kinds of things collected during his lifetime and now preserved at Hyde Park (where Roosevelt's private residence is located). From swimming boats to porcelain pigs, from ship models to miniature books, there are all kinds of things. Among them, there are 25,000 books, 6,000 maritime pamphlets, 31 kinds of periodicals, bound volumes of major newspapers, thousands of sets of carved ships, 200 ship models, eight major collections of British and American New Year's cards, original comic strips, old lithographic books, and many invitations, menus, coins, medals, and stamps.

Roosevelt liked to collect, but he never became obsessed. He used these things to regulate his mind and body, considering them the only way to rest after dealing with national affairs.

Roosevelt had a special habit when collecting stamps, that is, when he was engrossed in sorting stamps, he would puff out his cheeks, squeeze his upper and lower lips into an O shape, and whistle silently. When he casually put stamps into the stamp album, he would repeatedly puff out his cheeks and whistle repeatedly. A secretary once asked, "Mr. President, are you sure you know where these stamps are?" He said, "Of course, I have fifty years of experience!" It turned out that the meaning of puffing out his cheeks and whistling silently was: "Don't bother me, go away, the president is deep in thought."

On the morning of the declaration of war against Germany, he instructed his secretary to immediately move many first-edition books from the presidential palace to Hyde Park to avoid bombing. He believed that these rare books should belong to future generations. Therefore, the US government recently accepted the books and collections he donated. The government accepted the president's collections in 1939, and Roosevelt donated 16 acres of land in Hyde Park as the base for building a library. President's friends established a Roosevelt Presidential Library Association in New York, raising $370,000 in less than six months, which was enough to build the library. In September 1939, the President personally laid the cornerstone. Today, in the library, you can see a study arranged just like it was during his lifetime. In the right corner of the room is his desk, with many mementos and photos.

The President also had two hobbies: fishing and being able to guess the names of birds by listening to their songs. There are three things on display in the library that show he was a fisherman: an old gray jacket, a battered hat hanging in the closet, and a specimen of a valuable fish.

The birdsong in the valley by the Hudson River undoubtedly provided comfort and regulation for the President during the most tense times of the war. He would suddenly be in high spirits and run to Hyde Park to find the ornithologist studying in the library, inviting him to go to the forest at dawn the next day to guess the birdsong in a competition. A neighbor of Hyde Park and a group of guards patrolled around. They set off at four o'clock in the morning, and the neighbor recalled:

"When we arrived, it was still dark. The President sat quietly, as if listening to the performance of a grand concert. When the sky began to turn slightly fish-belly white, he said softly: Listen carefully! This first birdsong... a thrush! Then another birdsong, he pointed out the name of the bird. He continuously identified a total of thirty-three different birdsongs!"

Two hours later, Roosevelt again shouldered the heavy responsibility, facing the difficult situation in the midst of war.

### Illustrated Songs of the Western Expedition

— Wei Ren

Lang Shining, a Jesuit priest who served in the inner court of the late Qing Dynasty, can be called a "worldly monk" in our country's parlance. Why is he called that? Because this man had already seen through the vanity of the world, but was willing to travel across the ocean to China, the land of Marco Polo's adventures. His character was even more extraordinary: a monk who wanted to be an official, yet was also skilled in painting. He might as well try to be a classical artist. But this man didn't do that. Instead, he played with Chinese brushes, not only capturing the likenesses of subjects, but also imitating the ancients, even integrating Chinese and Western styles. He managed to make the "Perfect Old Man," Emperor Qianlong, completely convinced. Lang's paintings of the Eight Steeds had long been famous far and wide, and his meticulously crafted "Qianlong's Western Conquests," which took six years to complete, was an unprecedented masterpiece.

The "Western Conquests" consists of sixteen pages, each with an inscription by Qianlong, and became a treasure of the Qing Dynasty. This was copperplate engraved, and it seemed that imperial copies were printed and bestowed upon meritorious officials and generals, so many were circulated. It was no longer a rare treasure in the world. In the summer of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), I saw several pages in Shenyang. At that time, the asking price was 1.3 million yuan in legal tender, which shocked me. I could only sigh helplessly. Later, I obtained a complete set of photos of the "Illustrated Songs," mounted in yellow silk, with the eight characters "欽定御題，西被流沙，無思不服 (Imperially Inscribed by Kangde, the Western Sands Covered, All Submitted without Thought)" in front, exuding a majestic royal air. But where the original is, is unknown, and it is even more difficult to inquire about today.

The landscapes depicted in the pictures are all Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) scenery, even though it depicts the northern deserts. But the attire of the early Qing Dynasty is meticulously portrayed, sparing no expense in ink and brushstrokes. Looking at the pictures of surrendering and successive victories, the scene of "All Submitted without Thought" and collapsing at the mere sight of the army is truly enough for Qianlong to squander national funds and conceal the reality from the world with his love of grandeur and love of accomplishment. In the picture of the banquet at the Three Seas, the queue of people with queues prostrate themselves. Qianlong sits on the imperial carriage, surrounded by guards and musicians. It is unimaginable that Emperor Gao of Han, singing loudly about the Great Wind, could be surpassed. In the surrender at the Meridian Gate, from a high vantage point, the small clowns are afraid. As for the pictures of horses circling, bows bending, and flags falling, those who stand in the way are pushed aside, and those who receive the attack die. Compared with today's mechanized troops, they are much more inferior. It is a pity that after Jiaqing, the Emperors enjoyed wealth and ease, and the heroic spirit of the founding of the dynasty was like another world. Puyi abdicated the throne at a young age. If he could have been content and kept to himself, he would not have lost his status of being wise and protecting himself. But he was held hostage by the enemy and performed a puppet comedy, eventually being interrogated in Tokyo, begging for mercy with a wagging tail. If the Three Tombs of the Northeast knew, wouldn't they be heartbroken!

While admiring the "Illustrated Songs of the Western Expedition," I have a feeling of sighing again and again, but I don't know if Puyi will transform again someday, suddenly turning red in the face, leaving the world with a fourth sigh.

After the popularity of "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull," Churchill's "The Second World War Memoirs" has also begun to be revealed. These historical memoirs of two great figures are sufficient to be the summation of modern history. Because they were the authorities at the time, and their books are detailed and realistic, everything is clear with one book in hand.

We recall that in the two years before and at the beginning of the war, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's "Appeasing Policy" (or translated as "Appeasement Policy," which is too high-sounding. How can a policy of unreservedly yielding and being obsequious be called "appeasement"? It is better to use the word "perfunctory.") only increased the arrogance of Hitler's demonic flames, until he swept across Europe. Chamberlain resigned in shame, and Churchill took over as Prime Minister, confronting Hitler in a standoff for five years, through countless twists and turns, finally defeating Hitler. For England, it was a miracle of resurrection, and he retired after achieving success, doing nothing, like Song Mengqi living alone outside his meritorious service, and Feng Yi of the Han Dynasty retreating under the big tree, not competing with others. His style is unparalleled. When he stepped down victorious, it was already reported that he was engaged in writing, recounting his experiences. Now it has been written, and it is undoubtedly a "biography" along with Hull's memoirs.

Recalling the war, in addition to artillery fire, airplanes, and bombs, there was also the battle of pens and tongues, and propaganda. Hitler's demonic face had a distorted tuft of hair, and sinister, firey eyes that were unapproachable. Old Churchill, on the other hand, had a cigar in his mouth, a smile on his face, slanted eyes, and a leisurely pace, forever with that unhurried appearance, with the demeanor of using cold to restrain dryness, and waiting for work at leisure.

Churchill's virtue is that he does not shy away from his defeats, but only reports to his people in a truthful way on the gradual reduction of losses and the turning point from defeat to victory, so as to strengthen their confidence in the final victory. His broadcast in London on April 27, 1941, after the retreat of the Greek expeditionary force and setbacks in North Africa, did not deny it. Hitler gave a speech in his Berlin Congress on May 4 as a response to Churchill, besides cursing and scolding, also denounced him as a liar, saying that Churchill was able to distort the two battles of Norway and Dunkirk as British victories to deceive the world. At that time, we also felt that it was not very reasonable for Britain to exaggerate its retreats. Until the last two years, we learned that the safe withdrawal of troops from Dunkirk and the defense of the homeland by the British were indeed an indication of counter-offensive capabilities, and that the US government's praise for the withdrawal of US troops from Guam and the Philippines after the outbreak of the Pacific War also had strategic reasons. The so-called "being able to lose" is the prerequisite for being able to win. As for Japan and Germany, a mass of fire, were just like the overlord Xiang Yu, "seventy-two battles, undefeated in every battle, suddenly hearing the songs of Chu, suffered a crushing defeat." Xiang Yu was also a monster who could only go with the wind and could not withstand defeat.
