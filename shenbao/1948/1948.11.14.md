[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 13th] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi flew to the eastern front lines of Xuzhou at 2:00 PM today to supervise the battle. National Army reinforcements are steadily arriving at the front lines. The large-scale annihilation battle in the Bayi Ji area continues fiercely. More than 15,000 bandits were annihilated in the Mukong area today, and the battle results are being expanded.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 13th] Last night, the National Army on the eastern front surrounded four bandit columns of Chen's forces in Huashan Village, six *li* southeast of Bayi Ji. The joint land and air forces are intensifying their efforts to annihilate the bandits. The National Army can achieve a decisive victory within days.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 13th] On the western flank of Xuzhou, the National Army's Qiu Qingquan Corps annihilated more than 2,000 bandits from the 3rd Column of bandits in Huangshan, east of 　 County, on the morning of the 13th. The remnant bandits fled westward.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] The Xuzhou campaign has now entered the main battle phase. The current decisive battlefield is Nianzhuang, more than 100 *li* east of Xuzhou. The area is named for the stone mills ("*nian*") produced there. It is located southwest of the intersection of the Bulao River and the Grand Canal, and the Longhai Railway runs through it, with a station located there. The National Army's Huang Corps chose this area as the decisive battlefield, which provides a superior strategic advantage, as it is backed by the Grand Canal, which can attract bandits crossing the Jialu River from the south, and annihilate them all on the west bank of the Grand Canal. The area is also about 100 *li* from Taierzhuang, where the National Army won a great victory during the War of Resistance. It is expected that news of a swift victory at Nianzhuang will be reported soon, reminding people that both of these villages will become great fortresses of victory in military history.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] The war around Xuzhou still focuses on the eastern wing today. The remaining bandits west of the Grand Canal and south of the Bulao River, except for a small number who are blocking reinforcements to the west, are mostly concentrated in Nianzhuang. In the Bayi Ji area, they are trying to make a last-ditch struggle. Our Huang Corps has high morale and is supported by the Air Force, making them more courageous as they fight. They are now repeatedly charging at the bandits. In retaliation for their continuous defeats, military sources claim that the bandits used poison gas bombs. Fortunately, the Huang Corps was prepared and did not suffer major damage. The 28th Division of the 10th Column of bandits, which was blocking reinforcements to the west, was once lured to Damiao, 30 *li* east of Xuzhou, last night, and after a fierce attack, two of its regiments were eliminated, and more than 300 prisoners were captured. The National Army then took advantage of the victory to point east, coordinating with the Huang Corps to attack the remnant bandits on both sides. In addition, there were contacts and artillery battles on the western wing and the northern and southern fronts after midnight this morning. The Liangguang Column of bandits on the western wing advanced towards Xinmin Village and Qibu, 40 *li* northwest of Xuzhou. They were repelled by the National Army with the cooperation of the armed forces of the people of Tong, Feng, Pei, and Dang in northern Jiangsu.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] Amidst the sound of the Xuzhou campaign, the defection unit under the leadership of our Generals Hu and Li is actively carrying out the work of inducing Zhang Lie to defect. Zhang Guangzhong, a bandit from the Lunan Military Region and commander of the New 9th Column, whose 5th and 7th Regiments were originally good civilians from the Yixian, Tengxian, and Lincheng areas, shot and killed Zhang Yunshi, the commander of the 3rd Military Sub-region of the bandits, at 3:00 PM this afternoon and all defected. The total number of people is more than 3,000, with 1,200 rifles, one mortar, one heavy machine gun, 21 light machine guns, 10 grenade launchers, and a large amount of other military supplies. It is reported that they have all gathered in a certain place.

The powers of the Legislative Yuan will be reduced to avoid excessive constraints and affect the implementation of extraordinary measures during the suppression of the rebellion. However, the measures of this wartime system will be implemented after discussion and passage by the Legislative Yuan, completing the legislative process. Important decisions of the wartime cabinet will also maintain contact with the Legislative Yuan at any time."

President Chiang personally attended and delivered instructions. After the ceremony, the President delivered instructions, saying: "Grain is the foundation of the survival of the nation and the people, especially in wartime. This has been proven by historical facts both in China and abroad. Therefore, it is extremely important to have sufficient grain resources, seize opportunities, make overall planning, and allocate supplies. It is a crucial key to the success or failure of suppressing the rebellion. All provincial governments and public opinion organs should have a deep understanding of this. The quotas for land tax collection, borrowing, purchase, and procurement for this year must be achieved. Grain households across the country should be informed of the great righteousness and the advantages and disadvantages and must pay the required grain quotas on time. The central government has long stipulated clear regulations for the free flow of grain between provinces and counties, and for mutual aid to address surpluses and deficits. These regulations must be absolutely followed and earnestly implemented, and there must be no compliance in appearance but disobedience in reality, blocking and prohibiting transportation, which would create an artificial food shortage like today and affect the overall situation." The speech was earnest and lasted about forty minutes. Premier Weng then delivered a speech, giving many instructions on the importance of provinces fulfilling and delivering the agreed grain quotas on time and in full and on free circulation. Afterwards, the relevant ministers reported on the status of grain revenue and expenditure in great detail. Finally, proposals were discussed regarding increasing grain sources, allocating military grain on schedule and in full, and strictly prohibiting provinces and counties from banning the export of grain to ensure free circulation. The discussions were very detailed, and the principles were all approved as proposed. In the afternoon, ten groups discussed the proposals, convened by Vice President Zhang Jishen, Finance Minister Xu Kan, Comptroller-General Pang Songzhou, and Grain Minister Guan Jiyu.

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 13th] The northern and southern borders of Jian Gaoshan have not yet been demarcated. Taking advantage of this, the Burmese side has been invading and coveting the Yunnan border for more than a day. Recently, they sent Luba Bu to be responsible for supervising the construction of roads. One goes north along the Jiangxinpo, passing through the Daba Wuluo Three-way River to reach the southwest Yidi of Gongshan.

If the two roads are successfully built, the rich area of the Yunnan border area will be within the scope of the Burmese effort.

Editorial

### The Sentencing of Japanese War Criminals

The sentencing procedure for Japanese Class A war criminals concluded on the 12th. According to the verdict read by the International Military Tribunal, the individual verdicts and sentences for Tojo Hideki and the other 24 were summarized in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. Public opinion in our country has been closely following the sentencing of Tojo and other war criminals with intense interest. Those sentenced to death by hanging included Tojo Hideki, Doihara Kenji, Hirota Koki, Itagaki Seishiro, Kimura Heitaro, Matsui Iwane, and Muto Akira, a total of seven people. Those sentenced to life imprisonment included Araki Sadao, Hashimoto Kingoro, Hata Shunroku, Oshima Hiroshi, Shiratori Toshio, and Shimada Shigetaro, a total of sixteen people. Togo Shigenori was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment, and Shigemitsu Mamoru was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. The individual verdicts rarely mentioned the responsibility of Emperor Hirohito. According to the tribunal president, Webb, Hirohito should be called the "culprit," but he had been granted immunity. This is a major historical event, and we cannot feel completely satisfied with the conclusion of this event. Furthermore, we are even more surprised and uneasy about Marshal MacArthur's willingness to accept requests to reduce the sentences of the defendants. Therefore, we cannot help but be skeptical of the fair and reasonable standards that the International Military Tribunal has strived to pursue.

The Far East International Military Tribunal officially began on April 29, 1946, and concluded with the verdict on November 12 of this year, totaling two years and seven months. If we consider the International Prosecution Section's commencement of the investigation of Japanese war criminals on November 6, 1945, it has been exactly three years. Three years ago, the sacred spirit of the Potsdam Declaration was revered by peace-loving people all over the world. In the three years since, the justice of the Potsdam Declaration has gradually faded, gradually deteriorated, and even the punishment of Japanese Class A war criminals has been gradually diminished in its political and legal significance. The only consolation is that the verdict read this time is 2,500 pages long, with rich materials and complete descriptions, serving not only as a history of Pacific international relations over the past two decades, but also as a history of Japan's aggression wars abroad over the past two decades, possessing infinite historical significance, but not entirely a complete history. Although we have not yet read the full text of the verdict, we have developed a sense of suspicion from the sporadic reports, which are described as follows:

First, regarding the individual punishments: According to Article 10 of the Potsdam Declaration: "Stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners." The Allied Headquarters in Japan promulgated the Trial Ordinance on January 25, 1946, stipulating that the crimes to be tried by the court were of three types: (1) Crimes against peace, i.e., crimes of planning, preparing, initiating, and implementing aggressive war; (2) Crimes in violation of the laws and customs of war; (3) Crimes against humanity. As for the distinction between the severity of the three crimes, the direct perpetrators of the second and third types of crimes were Class C war criminals, their direct supervisors were Class B war criminals, and those responsible for the first type of crime were Class A war criminals. The 28 people (now only 25) tried by the International Military Tribunal, all belong to Class A war criminals, that is, all are direct perpetrators of crimes against peace. According to the precedent of the Nuremberg judgment and the standards of international criminal law, Japanese Class A war criminals should generally be sentenced to death by hanging and life imprisonment. As a result, only Tojo, Doihara and other seven were sentenced to death by hanging, and Shigemitsu and Togo were sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term. This is a kind of "leniency" that exceeds the standard of fairness. Although this iron judgment has reached a point of no return, peace-loving people all over the world find it difficult to accept the fact that sixteen Class A war criminals such as Araki are not dead.

Second, regarding the issue of Hirohito's lack of responsibility for the war: The leaders of Japan's war efforts over the past two decades were Hirohito and his inner circle of senior officials. In theory and in fact, Hirohito and his inner circle of senior officials cannot shirk their responsibility for disrupting the peace and war. Hirohito is not only an idol of the Japanese people, but also an authority in Japanese politics. The fact that Hirohito announced the surrender is proof of his authoritative political status. The Allied Headquarters granted Hirohito immunity, and the International Military Tribunal did not pursue the matter, indicating that the court's trial was more or less influenced by the Allied Headquarters. This is a regrettable event in the two years of hard work of the International Military Tribunal. Kido Koichi, a senior official in the inner circle and a supporter of the Tojo Cabinet, presided over the planning of the Pacific War and committed heinous crimes, but was sentenced to life imprisonment, reducing Kido's responsibility for disrupting the peace, which is tantamount to showing goodwill to Hirohito, and this is also something that people are not satisfied with.

Third, regarding the issue of sentence reduction: The lovable aspect of the Nuremberg trials was that the sentence was executed immediately after the pronouncement, and no sentence reduction was granted. The Allied Headquarters controlled the Tokyo trials, and it had the right to reduce the sentences of the defendants or order a delay in execution. The disadvantages of sentence reduction were discussed in this newspaper's editorial on the 4th of this month; we oppose the adoption of a military dictatorship's ruling system, changing the law with consciousness, changing the law with emotions, and changing the law with orders. Unexpectedly, at the end of the sentencing on the 12th, the Allied Headquarters announced that it was prepared to accept requests to reduce the sentences of the defendants and would invite representatives of the Control Committee to discuss the issue of sentence reduction, indicating that the Allied Headquarters had a plan in mind for reducing the sentences of Class A war criminals. As far as we know, Shigemitsu and Togo will be pardoned and acquitted, and half of the sixteen war criminals sentenced to life imprisonment will be converted to fixed-term imprisonment; as for whether the seven sentenced to death by hanging will receive preferential treatment for sentence reduction, it seems to be still undecided. This method of sentence reduction is a bad example that violates legal justice. If it is misused, it will inevitably lead to dissatisfaction among peace-loving people; this is tantamount to accommodating and even encouraging aggression. We hope that the representatives of the Control Committee and the responsible officials of the Allied Headquarters will handle it with a rigorous attitude. Those who play with fire will be burned by it. Isn't the painful lesson of history enough to be a warning?

The above three points are our feelings about the conclusion of the Tokyo trial sentencing, and also the attitude of doubt held by peace-loving people all over the world today towards the dignity of the law. We hope that the responsible officials of the Allied Headquarters and the representatives of the Control Committee will face up to the huge reaction of human peace and justice!

### Floating Capital Decided to be Effectively Diverted; Northeast Circulation Notes Completed Redemption on the 7th of This Month; Interest Rates on Deposits and Loans of Banks and Firms to be Publicly Posted

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Ministry of Finance News: The redemption of Northeast Circulation Notes will be completed on the 20th of this month. The total amount of redemption has not yet been reported by the Central Bank. As for the amount of Gold Yuan issued at the end of October, the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee has announced it. The total amount circulating in the Northeast is currently impossible to estimate. After the changes in the Northeast political situation, the inflow of floating capital is an inevitable fact. In addition to using the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, enemy and puppet industries, and Gold Yuan treasury bills, and encouraging investment in production, the government is now trying to make effective diversions to avoid affecting price fluctuations.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Ministry of Finance News: Since the promulgation of the supplementary measures for improving economic controls, the management of banks and money firms is being actively supervised, and banks and firms are instructed to use their funds to assist important production, transportation, sales, and public transportation export businesses, in order to promote production and stabilize prices. On the negative side, strict inspections are still being carried out to crack down on illegal operations of banks and firms, in order to avoid fueling speculation and hoarding. As for the deadline for increasing capital of banks and firms, the original two-month limit will still apply, but the implementation date in various places may be handled in accordance with the regulations on the date of legal implementation. Regarding the interest rates on deposits and loans of banks and firms, in order to cooperate with the implementation of supplementary economic control measures, the interest rate management regulations will still be followed, allowing the local banking and money industry associations to formulate interbank daily borrowing and lending rates and lending daily borrowing rates, report them to the local central bank for approval, and post them for implementation. This opinion has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and it can be implemented once approved.

### Many Judges of the International Military Tribunal Express Regret for Not Trying the Japanese Emperor; Execution Date for Tojo and Others Possibly on December 8th

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] At least two judges on the International Military Tribunal have strongly advocated trying Emperor Hirohito of Japan as a war criminal. One is the president of the court, Sir William Webb, and the other is French Judge Bernard. Although it is not yet known how many judges on the court share the same opinion as these two, at least two other judges have privately expressed their strong desire to see Hirohito stand trial as a criminal. Many judges of the court believe that even requesting Hirohito to testify is impossible, which is a loss for future historical records. When expressing his dissent, Judge Bernard of France insisted that Hirohito should be tried for war crimes, and the 25 convicted war criminals are merely accomplices of Hirohito.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] The execution of Tojo and six other war criminals sentenced to death by hanging by the Far East International Military Tribunal may take place on December 8th, the eighth anniversary of the Pacific War. It is widely rumored among Japanese and Allied residents that they will be executed on the morning of December 8th, possibly at the same time they launched the attack on Pearl Harbor eight years ago, igniting the Pacific War. This news seems credible because MacArthur has only allowed the defendants one week to submit appeals. Allied officials have declined to comment. Tojo has announced through his lawyer that he does not intend to appeal to MacArthur, but at least three of the twenty-five have requested clemency from MacArthur.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th, Associated Press] Former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other war criminals, who have been sentenced to death by hanging, are expected to be executed by Eighth Army officers at Sugamo Prison here.

### Announcement to Telegraph and Telephone Users

— Ma Mu

With military tensions on the front lines and the abandonment of price controls, the market has been fluctuating drastically, and prices are soaring. In this situation, the number of telegrams and telephone calls at the telecommunications bureau has increased several times like a tidal surge. The workload has already reached an extreme. Although the staff of the telecommunications bureau are working without a moment's rest, they still cannot clear the large backlog of telegrams and telephone calls. We naturally feel that we have not developed the manpower and equipment to a sufficient level in peacetime, but we are confident that we can endure hardship and work hard to the best of our ability when business is particularly busy. With the country facing difficulties and the overall situation turbulent, telecommunications transmission is particularly important in this era, and telecommunications employees cannot slack off in the slightest. We are working diligently at our posts, day and night, but we also hope that users understand the current difficulties in our work and give us more cooperation.

First, incoming and outgoing telegrams between Shanghai and Xuzhou-Bengbu have recently become more frequent due to increased military telegrams, and may not arrive within the specified time limit. The reason is that telegrams between Shanghai and these two locations must pass through the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau for transfer. Unfortunately, a major fire broke out at the Nanjing Bureau on the 8th, and work was suspended for a time. It is currently being rapidly cleared, and delays in transmission time are inevitable.

Second, in the past, the telecommunications bureau translated incoming and outgoing telegrams on behalf of users. However, with the increase in telegram traffic, manpower is still limited, and it is difficult to cope. We hope that telegram users can translate telegrams themselves as much as possible. This may add a step for users, but it greatly facilitates the transmission speed of the entire telegram.

Finally, long-distance telephone registration is also similarly congested. With limited lines, connections are made in order, and exceeding the time limit is occasionally unavoidable. In short, if users can understand these difficulties, we will continue to work hard to overcome the current difficulties.

### A Brief Discussion of Cable Circuits

— Chun

The equipment that the telecommunications bureau provides to users for installing telephones includes an automatic or manual switchboard in the bureau and a telephone or small exchange in the user's home. Between these two, there are cable circuits, which serve as telephone pairs for communication. When each user wants to have a private conversation on the telephone with another user, they certainly do not want others to interfere or hear their words. Therefore, each user must have a pair of lines for their exclusive use. This is different from other public utilities such as water, electricity, and gas, where a main pipe can be laid on a prosperous street to provide common use for users on both sides. However, telephone circuits must gather a large number of user pairs into a main cable and distribute them in a fan shape from the telephone exchange. Therefore, each exchange must have a cable circuit network, which must be perfectly planned before establishment. This is the main topic of telephone technology and the fundamental basis for installing telephones.

When a telephone exchange is first established, it must first define the business area. The size of this business area should be determined based on the simplicity or complexity of local commerce and the density or sparseness of residences. The location of the exchange should be in the center of the business area, so that the cable circuits are distributed in all directions, each with an average distance. After the location of the exchange is determined, the cable circuit network must be planned. This circuit network must be designed meticulously. More core cables should be laid on prosperous streets, while thinner cables can be laid in secluded alleys, or even overhead lines can be used. In recent years, the switchboard capacity of telephone exchanges in major cities around the world has been very large, and the thick cables used have as many as 3,600 cores, meaning that each cable can accommodate 1,800 pairs of user lines. Common sizes are 1,200 pairs, 600 pairs, 300 pairs, and 200 pairs. Thin types have 100 pairs, 50 pairs, and 25 pairs. Those installed on the walls of alleys are as thin as 15 pairs, 10 pairs, and 5 pairs. These cable cores are made of No. 21 hard copper wire, wrapped with red and white dry paper. Each red and white wire pair is twisted together to ensure complete insulation between them. The outermost layer is wrapped in lead skin. During manufacturing, internal moisture is removed to prevent leakage. Cables with more than 200 pairs are installed underground, using multi-hole clay pipes, nine or twelve holes, arranged in pipelines and buried in the road. At regular intervals, a manhole is opened, which is the round iron-covered hole commonly seen on the road. This manhole is the junction of the cables, quite deep and wide. During repairs, workers can stand inside to test and repair the circuits. Thin cables with less than 100 pairs are installed on telephone poles, suspended by hanging cable steel ropes and iron hooks. The end point of the cable is the distribution box. Distribution boxes have capacities of 100 pairs, 50 pairs, and 25 pairs. From the distribution box, either overhead copper wire or skin wire is used to connect the user line to each user's telephone. Therefore, when a user applies for installation, the circuit must be investigated first. This is to investigate whether there are empty lines in the cable box nearest to the application location. Assuming that the capacity of this distribution box is 100 pairs and 100 users have already been installed, later applications cannot be installed. If it is necessary to use the empty lines of a farther distribution box, the required materials will be greater, and more obstacles will arise, making maintenance difficult and inappropriate. The cable networks of Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's automatic telephone exchanges mostly use 600-pair and 300-pair underground cables, while manual exchange cables mostly use 100-pair overhead cables. As for longer distances and long-distance trunk cable circuits, No. 19 hard copper core wire is used, with the addition of loading coils, which can reduce the transmission loss of calls. This is another technical mystery, which will be elaborated in another article.

The design of a cable circuit network is a difficult task in engineering. Before designing, it is necessary to investigate the number of users in each type of building on each street in the business area who may apply for telephone installation, and to predict the degree of development in the coming years. Furthermore, it is necessary to estimate the number of telephone calls that users are likely to make each day after installing a telephone, so that the external cable circuit network and the number of switchboards in the bureau are mutually coordinated. Only with such a design can it be called a success. However, precise plans are often broken by the evolution of the situation. Taking the Hongkou Telephone Exchange under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau as an example, its cable network was originally designed by the Japanese enemy's Central China Company. At that time, the distribution of cables in the area east of Saisan Road was emphasized, and all were focused on this area. However, in the past three years, stores and residences in the western and northern Zhongshan Road areas of the Zhabei district of Hongkou have become increasingly prosperous, and there is often a lack of empty cable lines. Expansion and development are in the plan, but wire material projects require huge sums of money, and it will take time to realize them.

### Long-Distance Telephone, the Sound of a Thousand Miles

— Si Sheng

(1) The Most Convenient Communication Tool

Long-distance telephone is really one of the most convenient and efficient communication tools. No matter how far apart the two parties are, as long as the telecommunications bureau's lines extend to and open long-distance telephone service, they can freely talk, quickly achieve the purpose of the call, reduce the waste of time, and the method of use is simple, and people of all levels can enjoy it universally. Long-distance telephone has one more advantage: unlike other communication tools, such as letters, telegrams, etc., which can only be one-way communication, it can enable the two parties to meet and talk in a short period of time and make decisive decisions on important matters. Therefore, in today's increasingly complex social affairs, long-distance telephone has made a brilliant contribution, not only making everyone happy to use it, but also becoming an indispensable tool in human daily life.

(2) Long-Distance Telephone Registration Procedures

If you are often using long-distance telephones and already have a local telephone installed, it is best to go to the telecommunications bureau to pre-pay long-distance call fees. The amount of pre-payment is determined according to the number of long-distance calls made in a month. After completing this procedure, users do not need to go to the business office to register when making a call, just dial a telephone number. Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau users, please dial 13, Shanghai Telephone Company users, please dial 03 to register, and tell the recording station your telephone number, the name and address of the called party, and the type of call. After the long-distance operator has finished recording and checked that there are no errors, the operator will tell you the approximate connection time, and then wait quietly for the call. After the call, you do not need to pay the call fee immediately. At the end of the month, the telecommunications bureau will send you a detailed list of the long-distance calls you made in that month. According to the settlement of this list, go to the telecommunications bureau to settle the account once. If you do not have a local telephone installed at home, then you can only go to the telecommunications bureau business office to register, first get a long-distance telephone registration form, pay the call fee, and wait in order for the call, the procedure is also the same convenient.

(3) Types of Calls

Long-distance telephone calls are divided into "Ordinary," "Expedited," and "Express" according to speed. According to the nature, there are "Call Number," "Call Person," and "Call Out" types. A "Call Number" call is a call that only calls the telephone number, for example, Shanghai 71634 calls Nanjing 22001 without specifying someone to answer the call. As long as the two telephone lines are connected, the call is considered completed. This type of telephone is often used by large stores or important institutions. A "Call Person" call is when the calling party wants a specific person at a specific telephone number in a certain place to answer the call. However, if the calling party is afraid that the called person is not there, the calling party can declare in advance that if the called person is not there, another person can be designated to answer the call on their behalf. A "Call Out" call is used for called parties who do not have their own telephone. If you want to make a telephone call to a friend in another city, but the friend does not have a telephone at home, you need to ask the local telecommunications bureau to send someone to the friend's home to notify them, you need to use this type of "Call Out" telephone. This type of telephone is more troublesome in procedure and wastes more time, so the price is relatively high. There is also a cheap night call. If the telephone you are making is not time-sensitive and can be made between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am the next morning, you may wish to make a night call, and the call fee is calculated at 70% of the original call type.

(4) How to Calculate the Number of Calls

The number of long-distance telephone calls is calculated from the start of the call, every three minutes is considered one call, even if it is less than three minutes, it must be counted as three minutes. If it exceeds three minutes, it is counted as two calls, and the maximum is three calls. In other words, each call can last up to nine minutes. Time is very precious, so there is no need to say much about greetings, and if you want to say it, say it after the important things have been discussed.

(5) Payment and Cancellation of Registration and Free Cancellation of Registration

After applying to make a long-distance telephone call, if the call is not made for some reason and the registration is cancelled, if the responsibility lies with the user, such as the called party is not there, the called party's address is incorrect or exceeds the transmission range, resulting in failure to notify, or is unwilling to make the call within the specified time limit after registration, a cancellation fee should be paid. If the responsibility lies with the telecommunications bureau, such as temporary line failure preventing connection to the called party, or the called party has been called but the calling party cannot be called, or the long-distance line is congested and cannot be cleared in time, resulting in the call not being connected after the specified time limit after registration and unwillingness to wait, the cancellation will be processed free of charge.

### Telecommunications Knowledge Talk (14)

— Zhang Jiayu

Lecture 6 How to Calculate the Number of Words (Continued)

Foreign Language Telegrams Just as we usually call all non-Chinese people "foreigners," we collectively call all characters not used by the various ethnic groups in China "foreign languages." There are a total of fifty-six languages in the world that are allowed to be used to write clear language telegrams. Each country, in addition to its own national language, adopts all or selects certain languages from these fifty-six languages as the languages approved for use in clear language telegrams.

The method of calculating the number of words in various foreign language telegrams is as follows: assuming that the sender writes according to the regulations and does not connect several words with relatively short spellings into one word in an attempt to skillfully save money, the usual practice is to count every fifteen letters as one word, that is to say, every word whose spelling length is within fifteen letters is counted as one word for billing purposes, and every word exceeding fifteen letters but within thirty letters must be counted as two words for billing purposes. If there are business logos or various abbreviations commonly used in the telegram, they are all counted as one word for every five letters. This is the basic principle for calculating telegram fees for foreign language telegrams.

Sometimes, we can see two kinds of word counts listed in the word count column of the incoming telegram header, for example, 18/15. This means that although only fifteen words are written in this telegram, because there are three words that should each be counted as two words, or there is one word that should be counted as three words and another that should be counted as two words, or there is one word that should be counted as four words, therefore, the entire telegram needs to be charged according to eighteen words. Therefore, we usually call the word count written before the forward slash (/) the "chargeable word count," and the word count written after the forward slash the "actual word count." In this section, we are preparing to talk about various methods of calculating the "chargeable word count." As for the actual word count, it only needs to be calculated according to the actual word count, which is very simple and does not need to be discussed in detail.

Among the various languages in the world, English is still the most widely used language to date. This is an undeniable fact. Taking China as an example, English is used in the absolute majority of foreign language telegrams between various parts of China or between China and foreign countries. Here, let me give a general introduction to the method of calculating the chargeable word count in English clear language telegrams:

(Note): The "single word" mentioned in each subsection below refers to counting every fifteen letters as one word. If it is exceeded, a telegram fee is added for every one to fifteen letters added. "Individual calculation" refers to individually calculating according to the original number of words contained in the word.

(1) Webster's Dictionary Method for Calculating Compound Words and Altered Words

1. Compound words defined in the dictionary (that is, words in Webster's Dictionary that connect two single words with a hyphen, such as connecting "to" and "day" into "to-day." For this type of compound word, just remove the hyphen and connect them into one word such as "today," then it can be calculated as a single word.

2. Altered words defined in the dictionary can be calculated as single words simply by removing the apostrophe, for example, writing DON'T (=do not) as DONT, writing MUSTN'T (=must not) as MUSTNT, and both are counted as one word. Also, for words indicating possession, if the possessive marker is omitted, for example, writing CHANG'S as CHANGS, it can also be counted as one word. However, if the sender insists on sending the hyphens, apostrophes, or possessive markers of the above omitted words, then the telegraph office will count the words before and after the hyphens, apostrophes, or possessive markers as one word each, and the hyphen, apostrophe, or possessive marker itself will also be counted as one word. According to this method, TO-DAY, DON'T, MUSTN'T, CHANG'S, etc., must each be charged as three words, which is of course very uneconomical.

### Ivat and Lie Call on the Leaders of the Four Powers to Resolve the Berlin Dispute; Secretary Marshall Issues a Statement Reaffirming the U.S. Position

[United Press Paris, 13th] United Nations General Assembly President Ivat and UN Secretary-General Lie today jointly appealed to the heads of state of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

[United Press Paris, 13th] The President of the Security Council, also the Argentine Foreign Minister, Bramuglia, met with Soviet Representative Vyshinsky last night. According to sources close to Bramuglia, the two discussed the Berlin issue. It is believed that Bramuglia is drafting a new plan to resolve the Berlin dispute, but the attitude of the Soviet Union is unknown.

[United States Information Service, Paris, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference that the United States still hopes that the Security Council can put forward a proposal to resolve the Berlin deadlock. He continued, "The position expressed by the Western countries on October 27 remains valid." This statement reiterates the willingness of the Western countries to implement suggestions for resolving the Berlin deadlock, similar to those previously proposed by neutral countries but rejected by the Soviet Union. Secretary Marshall stated that the United States will continue to maintain the Berlin airlift and is confident that it will succeed. Marshall did not believe the news from Moscow suggesting that President Truman might meet with Stalin, considering it indicative of the Soviet leaders' frustration at not being able to garner support for their policies in the United Nations and elsewhere. Marshall also stated that the people of the world should be wary of Soviet propaganda, saying that everyone desires peace and not propaganda for peace. Regarding the proposed North Atlantic Security Treaty, Marshall pointed out that the discussions between the United States and Western European countries were initially exploratory in nature but have now entered a more concrete stage. Discussing the European Recovery Program, Marshall said that there has been significant progress. Regarding the situation in Greece, Marshall said that the Greek problem is part of a larger problem, which can be seen in the Soviet blockade of Berlin and the rise of the Communist Party in China. Regarding his own tenure issue, Marshall stated that he has never indicated when his term as Secretary of State will end and will not make such a statement until he consults with President Truman.

[United Press Paris, 13th] Marshall recently issued a brief statement denying that he had decided to resign on January 20. The full text of the statement is as follows: "I read in the newspaper this morning that I 'insist on my original decision to resign from the cabinet on January 20.' I regret that my remarks at yesterday's press conference have caused a misinterpretation. I thought I had clearly stated that I would not make a decision until I discussed it with the President, and the President and I have not yet discussed this matter."

### Vyshinsky Defends Himself Vigorously; Claims Soviet Policy Aims at Peace; Says Plan for World Revolution is Also Untrue

[United Press Paris, 13th] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to debate the issue of disarmament today. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky spoke, accusing the United States of preparing another "Pearl Harbor" for the Soviet Union. He said that Americans like Air Force Lieutenant General Kenney have announced their plans to take off from British bases with American long-range bombers, carrying atomic bombs directly over the Soviet Union. "You are using trickery and intolerance to try to start a war, but today you are trying to shift the blame to us, who have never dreamed of doing so."

He exclaimed, "You create this atmosphere of suspicion and fear day and night. You hide behind France, preparing to return the Ruhr area to Hitler's subjects, and have already torn up international agreements with one hand." British and American representatives condemned the Soviet Union on the 12th for obstructing the peace treaties with Germany and Japan. Vyshinsky replied, "Peace treaties with Germany and Japan can be concluded, but they should not be limited to one area. The Potsdam Agreement has established a foundation, but instead of following it, you have chosen to establish West Germany to rival the Soviet Union, rather than seeking a comprehensive solution." Regarding Japan, he said that the original agreement was to entrust the power of resolution to the Council of Foreign Ministers, but the Western countries demanded to convene a peace conference of all countries that fought against Japan. "Because you obstructed one of them, the peace treaty could not be concluded." Vyshinsky denied that the Soviet Union's goal was world revolution and cited the record of Stalin's meeting with American journalist Howard in Moscow in 1936 as proof. Stalin told Howard at the time, "It is foolish to believe that the Soviet Union is planning a world revolution. Any country can have a revolution if it wishes, and it can do without it if it does not. But to say that we intend to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and instigate revolutions is completely unfounded." He also said, "If you try to cover up the aggressive intentions of your policies by shouting that the Soviet Union has ambitions, this is nothing more than a fairy tale for children. All we are doing is for the sake of peace."

### UN General Assembly Establishes Special Committee to Discuss the Holy Land Issue

Running Parallel with the Political Committee

[United Press Paris, 13th] UN General Assembly President Ivat proposed to the Steering Committee today to establish a 58-nation Special Committee to accelerate the discussion of the Holy Land issue and other issues. The Holy Land issue is currently listed in the Special Committee's agenda, and there will not be sufficient time to discuss it before the General Assembly ends on December 8, so it should be discussed separately. The work of the Special Committee will run parallel with the Political Committee, which is currently entangled in the disarmament issue.

[United Press Paris, 13th] The UN Security Council Subcommittee passed Bunch's ceasefire plan today, according to which the entire Nitzanim area will be demilitarized.

### Soviet Union Accuses MacArthur of Disregarding Soviet Protests

Suppression of Activities of Japanese Democratic Groups

[United Press Tokyo, 13th] Soviet Representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Lieutenant General Kuzma Derevyanko, fiercely criticized the United States' policy of occupying Japan for the second time, this time to Marshal William Sebald, on the 13th. Derevyanko raised the protest against MacArthur's order to ban strikes by civil servants, a labor policy, which he had opposed in the Supervisory Council. He also said: "Soviet protests have been ignored, causing numerous obstacles to the activities of Japanese democratic groups, and more than a dozen examples of the suffocation of Japanese democratization have occurred." He said: Japanese democrats are being suppressed. Extreme fascist national forces are rising, and actively unfolding. They are sometimes openly advocating the repeat fascistic behavior in Japan. Derevyanko asked the party to stand to attention and immediately oppose Japanese democratic groups due to "suppression" in fascist activities.

### Standard Salary for Employees to Be Determined Based on Rising Living Costs; Authorities to Announce Decision Tomorrow Following Request from the General Labor Union, Employees Will Not Be Differentiated

[Our Newspaper] All sectors have recently shown the greatest concern for the city's cost of living index. The Municipal Government, recognizing this as a practical and technical issue, has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly manage it with the Statistics Office. Yesterday afternoon, the General Labor Union representatives Shui Xiangyun, Liang Yongzhang, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Fang Rusheng, and others visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau again. They stated that the union had repeatedly received requests from trade unions of department stores, clothing stores, sauce manufacturers, and canned food factories, indicating that the cost of living index compilation included fifty-four items for workers and ninety-three items for staff. The staff index was lower than the worker index, and those whose salaries were calculated based on the staff index were experiencing severe difficulties in this period of drastic price fluctuations, requesting that salaries be calculated based on the worker index. The General Labor Union therefore requested a uniform compilation of the cost of living index, generally referred to as the employee cost of living index, without distinguishing between workers and staff. Director Wu accepted this request. As for the allocation of rice, sugar, oil, cloth, and fuel to industrial workers starting from November, the allocation certificates have been printed, and distribution can begin after the 15th. Soap and cigarettes may also be added to the allocation. After meeting with the representatives of the General Labor Union, Director Wu immediately went to see Mayor Wu to seek instructions regarding the cost of living index issue. The mayor agreed to the General Labor Union's proposed approach. According to Director Wu, after meeting with the mayor, he told reporters that a figure would be announced by the Municipal Government or the Social Affairs Bureau on the 15th to serve as a standard for salary payments in various industries.

### Yu Shengxiao Murder Case: Que Li Still Sentenced to Lengthy Imprisonment

The Special Criminal Tribunal gave judgment on the case and pronounced the sentence yesterday morning. Que Li was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to murder and robbery of property.

### Cooperative Loans Used for Personal Gain: Xie Shimin and Others Indicted

[Our Newspaper] Xie Youmin, chairman of the Zihang Township Cooperative in Shanghai County, and Xie Yaoquan, the manager, applied to the Shanghai County branch of the China Farmers' Bank for a loan of 627.52 million legal tender in June of this year to purchase 424 pieces of soybean cake at a price of 1.48 million legal tender per piece. The Agricultural Bank stipulated that the soybean cake should be loaned to farmers, with interest at 7.5% to be collected by the end of November. Xie and others violated the regulations and issued the soybean cake on July 3rd, charging 2.5 million legal tender per piece without authorization, and collecting fees at that time. The Agricultural Bank detected the matter and notified the Shanghai County Government to detain and interrogate them, and then transferred them to the Shanghai District Procuratorate for investigation. The case has been concluded by the District Procuratorate, and yesterday, they were publicly prosecuted for corruption.

### General Labor Federation Inaugural Meeting Decided to Move to Shanghai; Li Zhuchen and One Other Person Re-Elected to Go to Beijing Yesterday; Representatives in Beijing Invited to Attend in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] The inaugural meeting of the National General Federation of Industry, originally scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 11th of this month, was moved because more than a hundred representatives from Shanghai and other places in Shanghai were unable to go to Beijing due to transportation difficulties. Yin Zhizhong, Guo Yongxi, and Xi Zhengxi were specially elected to go to Beijing to request that the meeting be moved to Shanghai and to invite representatives in Beijing to come to Shanghai. After Yin Zhizhong and the other two arrived in Beijing, they immediately stated the opinions of the representatives remaining in Shanghai to the General Assembly and visited Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Minister Gu said that the government had no preconceived notions about whether the General Assembly was held in Beijing or Shanghai, but hoped that all representatives would work together to ensure the smooth progress of the meeting. The Nanjing side had held the meeting as scheduled and also sent representatives to Shanghai to invite the representatives remaining in Shanghai to attend the General Assembly in Beijing. Yesterday, the representatives remaining in Shanghai held meetings all day long and reached an agreement with the Nanjing side to postpone the meeting. After much negotiation, they invited some representatives in Beijing to agree to move the meeting to Shanghai. The representatives in Beijing were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:25 last night. Shanghai industry leaders Du Yuesheng and Liu Hongsheng also planned to hold a banquet on the 6th floor of the China Merchants Bureau to welcome them, but they were unable to make it due to the train delay. Last night, Shanghai re-elected Li Zhuchen, Pan Yangshan, Chen Yunzhang, Yan Yaoqiu, Zhi Bingyuan and other five people to take the night train to Beijing to once again invite the representatives in Beijing to continue to participate in the General Assembly in Shanghai. If there are no other changes, the inaugural meeting of the General Federation of Industry will continue to be held in Shanghai on the 15th and 16th of this month, and the venue has been selected at No. 27 Dihua North Road. The Municipal Industrial and Economic Association has set up a reception group to solve the food, accommodation, and return transportation problems for the representatives from all over the country who come to Shanghai.

### Private Schools Decide to Continue Collecting Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees to Subsidize the Livelihoods of Teachers and Staff, Charging Two to Four Times the Original Fee

[Our Newspaper] Private primary and secondary school teachers in this city are facing serious threats to their livelihoods due to soaring prices. A few days ago, they sent representatives to visit Mayor Wu, requesting that the November rice allocation be issued immediately, and that teachers be given a subsidy of 500 yuan per person. In addition to the special rice allocation, the mayor agreed to notify the Civil Affairs Committee to issue it as soon as possible. However, the subsidy could not be allocated due to the city's treasury deficit. After discussion, the mayor agreed in principle to collect additional fees from students' parents to alleviate the emergency. The Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools convened an enlarged meeting of directors and supervisors at No. 553 Zhongzheng Middle Road at 3 p.m. yesterday, with representatives from the teaching staff also attending to discuss the matter. It was decided to continue to collect tuition and miscellaneous fees from students' parents, with the standard being two to four times the fees charged by each school at the beginning of the semester. The collection will begin after the 18th of this month, with the principle being to collect the fees in one lump sum, and to expand the number of free places as much as possible so that poor students will not be unable to attend school. In addition to free places, individual applications for payment in installments may also be made. The proceeds from this additional collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees will be used primarily to subsidize the livelihoods of teachers and staff, as well as to subsidize school workers and to cover the increased costs of water and electricity for the school. After the meeting, Jiang Jizhou, chairman of the Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools, visited Li Ximou, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, to report on the results of the meeting. Director Li said that this matter must take into account the burden on parents and that technical issues must be discussed in detail, and a final decision will be made after requesting instructions from the mayor.

According to the fee standards for private schools in this city this semester, senior high school is 45 to 60 yuan, junior high school is 25 to 50 yuan, and elementary school is 15 to 30 yuan.

### Military Dropped a Bomb, Fortunately It Did Not Explode and Injure Anyone

[Our Newspaper] Han Changfu, a worker at the Tongshang Transportation Company on Huqiu Road, was driving a transportation truck with license plate number 03-3197 to the Maigen Road Station at about 8:10 yesterday morning to load goods. When passing Jinlin Road in Zhabei, a military truck came head-on. Because the truck was traveling very fast and the road was rugged, an object on the military truck was shaken off and fell to the ground. Han saw it and jumped down to pick it up. He saw that it was wrapped in newspapers and was quite heavy. After taking it back to the transportation company, he unwrapped the package and was shocked to find that it was a small bomb, about eight inches long. Fortunately, it did not explode.

### Participating Employees Jointly Protest: Method for Distributing Surplus Materials; Question Supply Bureau by Presenting Three Reasons

Following the Material Supply Bureau's announcement of changes to its recent method of preferentially distributing surplus materials to public and private school personnel in the city, the entire staff of the Municipal Council Secretariat sent a joint letter to Jiang Biao, the director of the Material Supply Bureau, yesterday. They argued that the Bureau's claim that the distribution order could not be maintained was due to the inadequacy of the previous method. The fault did not lie with the public and private school personnel who were entitled to the benefits. Furthermore, the recently changed ten-item method was tantamount to restricting and shackling the special rights granted to public and private school personnel by the state. This phenomenon should be carefully considered and corrected. The letter concluded by requesting that the Material Supply Bureau take into consideration the government's intentions in distributing materials in the future, prioritize the welfare of public and private school personnel, and fulfill their responsibilities by clearly handling matters in a reasonable manner to comfort those who are eagerly waiting. Excerpts of the three reasons listed in the original letter are as follows:

Difficult to Comply with the Urgent Deadline

(1) Public and private school personnel are organized citizens with clear identities, each with an organization, a structure, and a commanding officer. The distribution of materials could have been handled very simply by each organization's leader submitting a roster to your bureau each month to complete the purchase procedures. The allocation of daily necessities to public and private school personnel in this city has been well-established for some time, and there has never been any phenomenon of disorderly order or inability to maintain the system. However, your bureau does not do this. Instead, it forces more than 100,000 public and private school personnel to personally squeeze in to purchase materials during the short time on Saturdays and Sundays. Not only is it difficult to choose under crowded conditions, but most people gain nothing and spend a lot of time and effort. The current method, in principle, seems to be improved, but the losses of public and private school personnel are considerable. For the allocation of materials in October, a notice requires each organization to complete the purchase procedures at your bureau before the 15th of this month. The staff of each organization has internal and external duties, and the organization of the institution has both upper and lower levels. Within a short period of five days, each organization must carry out various procedures such as notification, investigation, and registration with the staff. It is absolutely impossible for each organization to do this in a forced manner.

What is the Basis for Adjusting the Allocation Price?

(2) The price of the allocated materials will be adjusted at any time according to the treatment of public and private school personnel. It is unknown what the basis is. If it is said that the price of allocated materials must be adjusted, how can the price change be known to be exactly in line with the treatment of public and private school personnel? If it is said that they must use a part of their salary to buy surplus materials, why doesn't the government directly deduct a part of the salary of public and private school personnel and compensate them with surplus materials? Moreover, the price adjustment after October is "average," increasing by half of the original price. There must be some items that have increased by more than half, and some items that have increased by less than half. How can it be guaranteed that items that are more practical for the families of public and private school personnel will not increase by more than half, and that items that are not practical will not increase by less than half? Moreover, the adjustment of the treatment of public and private school personnel is only seen in the newspaper that it will increase by half from November, and the order has not yet been issued. However, the materials allocated by your bureau must start to increase in price from October. Regarding this point, it is unknown how your bureau justifies itself.

Where is the True Intention of Compensation for Damages?

(3) Item 9 of the public notice method states: "For the convenience of both parties in the sale and purchase, please observe order and purchase in accordance with the item distribution notice. In order to prevent unscrupulous people from posing as public and private school personnel to seize the opportunity to purchase and disturb the store, please also ask the on-site public and private school personnel to jointly assist the police in correcting and stopping them. If any disturbance occurs that causes the departments (stores) to suffer material losses, the selling price will be increased once or twice for compensation, and after three times, this preferential purchase method will be stopped." The meaning of these words is obscure, and I sincerely do not know what the true intention is. If you try to interpret it literally, it is especially out of order. Since each organization purchases in order according to the notification form, how can a disturbance occur? Moreover, once your bureau's materials are damaged, the selling price must be increased once or twice to compensate. Three times will stop this preferential distribution method. It is also unknown what it means. If someone damages your bureau's materials, your bureau can directly bring them to justice or investigate the responsibility for damages. How can you order the general public who have not received the materials to compensate jointly?

### Rice Panic Gradually Subsides: White Rice Reduced to 500 Yuan per Stone

The rice market officially resumed trading yesterday, and there were also many arrivals, totaling 2,572 stones and 5 dou in the north and south markets. The North Market had 1,136 stones, and the South Market had 1,436 stones and 5 dou. The market conditions were high at first and then low. The North Market's white rice opened at 520 yuan and closed at 550 yuan. The South Market's white rice opened at 550 yuan, and the price outside the market dropped to 500 yuan, but no one was interested. Credit is extremely tight, and the shadow interest rate is still high. A large amount of rice from other ports and foreign rice is being shipped to Shanghai, so people continue to look down on the market. The rice panic may be completely relieved next week.

### The Cash Shortage Remains Severe

The Gold Yuan Supervisory Committee Holds a Meeting Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The issuance limit of the Gold Yuan remains at the original amount of 2 billion before the formal arrival of the amended regulations in Shanghai, hence the cash shortage on the market remains severe. Yesterday, many national banks and commercial banks went to the Central Bank to withdraw funds, but the Issuing Bureau and the Business Bureau found it difficult to cope. Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau, went to Yu Hongjun's residence to request instructions.

Related sources revealed: After the official price of gold and silver increased, there is a surplus in the issuance quota. Once the official document arrives in Shanghai, the issuance limit will inevitably increase, and the cash shortage can be resolved at that time.

Furthermore, the Gold Yuan Issuance Supervisory Committee also convened a meeting yesterday afternoon. All members, including Li Ming, attended. According to the amended regulations, future issuance figures will only be reported to the Executive Yuan on a monthly basis and will not be publicly announced.

National Bank Executives Summoned to Beijing

[Our Newspaper] After the announcement of the amended Gold Yuan issuance regulations, Finance Minister Xu Kan telegraphed Central Bank officials to Beijing to discuss the technical issues of implementation. Because both the President and Vice President of the Central Bank were on vacation, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, Wang Zishuang, Shao Zenghua, Wu Changfu, and others went instead. It is expected that after the officials return to Shanghai, decisions can be made on the implementation of gold and silver trading and the various provisions in the new regulations.

Money Supply Slightly Eases, Interest Rates Adjusted

The money supply in the market was slightly eased yesterday, despite being a weekend. Foreign remittances poured in, and people's confidence slightly improved due to the amendment of the Gold Yuan issuance regulations. The demand for funds was not as high as in the past. However, the underground interest rates in the market remained high, approximately 50 to 80 yuan per day, equivalent to 1.5 to 2.4 yuan per month. Cash funds are still very scarce.

The Shanghai Banking and Monetary Industry Joint Preparatory Committee, along with the Shanghai Banks, Native Banks, and Trust Companies Association, in view of the rapid rise in underground market interest rates, has specially adjusted the interest rate listings of their respective associations to adapt to the situation. The details are as follows:

(1) Deposit daily interest: 4.5 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to 0.135 yuan per month, an increase of 0.045 yuan from the original rate.

(2) Loan daily interest: 13 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to 0.39 yuan per month, an increase of 0.12 yuan from the original rate.

(3) Interbank daily interest: 11 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to 0.33 yuan per month, an increase of 0.105 yuan from the original rate.

(4) Public Treasury bond daily interest: 11 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to 0.33 yuan per month, an increase of 0.105 yuan from the original rate.

Newly Minted Coins to be Issued Soon

[Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the amended Gold Yuan issuance regulations, the Central Mint has been actively preparing to mint coins. It is expected that they will be officially issued by the end of this month. The new regulations stipulate that subsidiary coins from 1 fen to 5 jiao will be minted with copper and nickel respectively, so the 5 jiao silver coins, although some have been minted, will not be issued in practice. However, as of now, no formal instructions have been received from the Ministry of Finance.

### People's Foreign Exchange Deposits Should Still be Transferred to the National Bank

After the government announced the policy allowing people to hold gold, silver, and foreign currencies, there was a question of whether the previous government regulations on reporting and transferring people's foreign exchange should continue to be implemented. According to relevant sources: The new regulations announced yesterday stipulate that deposits of gold, silver, and foreign currencies must be handled by banks designated by the Central Bank, so it is beyond doubt that non-designated banks are not allowed to accept such deposits. It is also inevitable that all past foreign exchange deposits should still be transferred.

### Import and Export Settlements Calculated at a Ratio of 1:20

[Our Newspaper] The Export-Import Control Committee held an important meeting yesterday morning to discuss the promotion of the import and export trade settlement system after the change in the Gold Yuan exchange rate. It was decided that henceforth, all import and export settlements will be calculated at a ratio of 1:20. As for other trade reforms, they will be implemented after the official order arrives.

### Prices of Our Export Goods Stable Overseas

Price Limits for Bristles and Straw Hats Changed

According to the Export-Import Control Committee: In the past week, the prices of our major export goods have been extremely stable overseas, so the export price limits have not changed in general, except for bristles and straw hats.

The external asking price in the yarn market was weak due to tight credit and slow sales. 42-count fine yarn (Blue Phoenix brand) fell to 7,600-7,700 yuan. Near closing time, buying increased from all sides and the asking price suddenly rebounded, rising to 9,000 yuan, an increase of 1,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. The overall trend for the day was positive, with fine yarn up 1,300-1,500 yuan due to competition from local replicating industries, while coarse yarn only rose 400-500 yuan.

The external asking price in the cotton cloth market was mediocre at the beginning. Rumors circulated that speculative funds were coming to Shanghai and buyers were eagerly searching. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was initially offered at 260 yuan, but then the asking price gradually fell to 240 yuan due to increased selling. Near noon, it rebounded to 265 yuan and finally closed at 310 yuan, an increase of 45 yuan compared to before the holiday.

Downstream Cotton Market

There were no transactions in the raw cotton market yesterday and no prices were quoted. Although credit in the market was slightly easier, there were still shortages of funds, leading to a sluggish market. Only Zhoupu seed cotton was traded, with prices quoted at 250 yuan in the morning, falling to 230 yuan. In the afternoon, due to some firms needing to settle accounts on Saturday, the asking price continued to decline, reaching a low of 210 yuan.

### Flour, Oil, and Grain Plunge, Transactions Gradually Returning to Normal

The decline in edible oil prices was also sharp. After the announcement of the amended Gold Yuan issuance plan, everyone believed that prices would fall, and people were extremely pessimistic. Soybean oil fell to 700 yuan yesterday, rapeseed oil fell by another 100 yuan, raw oil fell by 50 yuan, and soybean cake fell by 5 yuan.

Flour prices also continued to fall. "Battleship" flour opened at 125 yuan, a decrease of 35 yuan from the previous day. Other "Red Bee" and "Old Car" brands also started trading for the first time yesterday. All outlets also supplied flour starting yesterday.

More miscellaneous grains were traded. Corn was stable, while broad beans and white beans each fell by 20 yuan, shelled peanuts fell by 10 yuan, and the rest were stable. Arrivals were also more abundant than before.

### Sugar Initially High, Then Rebounded

Yesterday, the sugar market saw slightly easier credit within the industry, and speculative funds from other regions poured into Shanghai. Local firms also participated in the buying, and market sentiment was quite firm. Under the influence of speculative buying, floating orders rose one after another. However, rumors that various import companies were still opening allocations and that the allocated prices would be suppressed caused a sudden shift in sentiment. Various firms stopped buying and started selling, and prices softened again at the close. No. 4 and 5 white refined sugar initially traded at 400 yuan ex-customs, but sentiment turned from firm to weak in the middle of the day, and prices fell sharply, closing at 350 yuan. Coarse and medium-grade sugar initially rose and then declined, while the rest uniformly fell by 30-50 yuan.

### The Huainan Railway, Past and Present

— Our Reporter Dou Baiping

[Our Newspaper, Jiulonggang, August 8] The Huainan Railway and the Huainan Coal Mine are twin brothers under the jurisdiction of the Huainan Mining and Railway Co., Ltd. They are closely related and complement each other. Without the railway, the coal mine would suffocate. Without the mine, the railway would decline. Today, the business of both the mining and railway bureaus is thriving because these two brothers are working hand in hand, advancing toward a fixed goal.

A Page of History Today, the mine is producing coal every day and night, while the railway is not fully operational. Not only is the mine anxious, but the entire province of Anhui is calling for it in vain. This railway starts from Tianjia'an on the north bank of the Huai River to Yuxi on the north bank of the Yangtze River, with a total length of 214 kilometers. Although it has only been around for more than ten years, it has endured many hardships. Just like a child from a poor family, it was malnourished in the womb, had congenital deficiencies, and suffered family changes after birth, resulting in developmental disorders. Even today, it has not developed healthily, and even has physical defects. Although the nanny is taking extra care of it, difficulties still exist.

When planning to build this railway, the original line only ran from the mine to Bengbu to connect with the Jinpu Railway for transporting coal. However, because it would be restricted by the Jinpu Railway, it was decided to extend it to the riverbank to seek free development. Initially, the Construction Committee allocated 500,000 yuan from the proceeds of the sale of the Changxing Coal Mine Company to be used as a road-building fund. In 1933, because the funds were insufficient, the construction committee mortgaged all the assets of the Qi Tang Weir Power Plant, the Capital Power Plant, and the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau to borrow 3 million yuan from the Shanghai banking group, of which 1.28 million yuan was used to complete the Huainan Mine to Hefei project. In 1934, another 3.7 million yuan was borrowed, and the road was finally completed. On January 20, 1936, the entire line was opened to traffic. At this time, the daily output of coal was 1,200 tons, and the transportation problem was solved.

The Storm Came Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the storm came. Only one and a half years after opening, the Anti-Japanese War broke out. In October 1937, it was ordered to be destroyed. This railway, which occupied 21,442 mu of land, suddenly became useless land. In 1939, the Japanese restored its use for looting coal, and later dismantled the 188-kilometer track from Shuijiahu to Yuxi and moved it to build a branch line from Shuijiahu to Bengbu, which was directly under the jurisdiction of the "Central China Railway Management Committee". After the Japanese surrender, the Shuibeng branch line was completely destroyed by bandits. When Director Wu Jingqing and Deputy Director Hu Weizhong came to take over, there were only 27 kilometers of railway from Tianjia'an to Shuijiahu, three dilapidated stations, an unfinished machine shop, and 300 dilapidated vehicles. Although the restoration of the Huainan Railway was constantly talked about, where was the money? The company itself borrowed money from all sides. After three years, the section from Shuijiahu to Hefei (70 kilometers) was restored and opened to traffic on this year's Double Ten Festival. In our country, where the transportation industry is not well developed, the Huainan Mining and Railway Company has encountered unexpected difficulties due to objective and subjective limitations.

Problems with the Entire Line The entire country is in turmoil, and people's lives have been unstable, resulting in insufficient means of transportation. The Jianghuai Plain relies on the full operation of the Huainan Railway for external transportation. Since the Shuijia-Hefei section opened, together with the Shui-Tian and Shui-Zha sections, it carries 9,000 passengers per day, and even more freight. However, the Hefei-Yuxi section is not open, and the Jianghuai Plain still feels suffocated. Coal transportation is particularly difficult at this stage. From the outside and from within, this road must be quickly repaired. Although the materials for the Hefei-Chaoxian restoration are not a problem and track laying is underway, the materials for the Chaoxian-Yuxi (50 kilometers) section are still not available. This may seem insignificant to the state-owned major railways, but it is not so simple for Huainan itself, especially in today's failing economy. The road must be repaired. Given the current situation, there are concerns about obtaining loans, and business profits are limited and cannot be used for major purposes. The company has not forgotten the road restoration in any case. According to Deputy Director Hu Weizhong, if money is not a problem, the Hefei-Chaoxian section is expected to open to traffic by the Lunar New Year, and the road should reach Yuxi on the river by the time people are drinking realgar wine next year. The reporter wishes the Railway Bureau's plan to be completed on schedule, so that external transportation in the Jianghuai region will no longer be suffocated, and coal can be transported to the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, allowing all large and small chimneys to smoke!

The Railway Bureau Machine Shop Speeds Up Restoration Amidst the sound of railway restoration, the contribution of the Railway Bureau Machine Shop cannot be ignored. The reporter was led on a tour by Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau Ning Shufan and Director of the Machine Shop Liu Xinmin. The shop includes locomotive, boiler, foundry, forging, vehicle, electrical, and machining workshops. There are more than 200 pieces of machinery, large and small, and more than 50 skilled workers who are dedicated to their work, focused on repair and manufacturing, and operating in a tense, serious, and disciplined manner. In addition to repairing locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, they also repair ships, automobiles, and mining machinery. Organizationally, it is now divided into two sections: the first machine shop, specializing in the repair and manufacture of vehicle parts; and the second machine shop, specializing in the repair and manufacture of locomotive parts, with 53 staff members managing the work of 500 workers. Equipment and raw materials limit development. Wheel axles and wheel rims cannot be made locally and must be purchased from abroad, but the beautiful first- and second-class passenger cars speeding on the railways today are assembled here.

In the face of the current situation, where the flames of war are raging and the situation in the Huai River region is tense, there is inevitably concern for the mine and the railway. However, the authorities of the mine and railway do not consider these issues. When talking to the reporter, they said: "Currently, we will do what we can. We must strive to complete the entire line." Their determination and courage in construction are commendable and praiseworthy.

### Zhenhai Stipulates Rickshaw Fares, Organizes Gruel, Rice, and Clothing Distribution

[Our Newspaper, Zhenhai, December 12] The County Labor-Management Arbitration Committee convened its eighth committee meeting on the 11th, and after deliberation, decided: (1) Wages in all industries that were calculated in grain before "August 19" will continue to be calculated in grain. (2) The wages for porters will be increased by 21 times compared to the wages decided at the seventh arbitration. The maximum haircutting fee is 2 yuan, with a reduction of 5 jiao for each subsequent cut. Rickshaw fares are a maximum of 2 yuan in the urban area, 3 jiao per Chinese mile in Jiangnan, and ferry fares are 3 jiao per passenger per crossing.

At the same time, starting from the 16th of this month, fundraising will be expanded to 100,000 Gold Yuan, targeting five sectors: wealthy households, hotels, restaurants, ships, and automobiles, to ensure sufficient funding. In addition, the Provincial Social Affairs Office has allocated winter relief clothing to the county, including 170 large cotton vests and 170 small ones, which have been collected and are on their way to Zhenhai. They will be distributed to the poor to protect them from the cold on a scheduled basis. Furthermore, bandit Zhou Guiliang (also known as Ju Bin) was arrested by Luo Shusheng, the deputy commander of the county security regiment, in Zhanqi, at the border between Zhenhai and Yin County, and was handed over to the county on the 12th.

### Changzhou's Rice Reserves Exhausted; Middle Peasants Not Allowed to Transport Grain Out

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, December 12] Recently, the county's rice reserves have been extremely depleted, and rural goods have not yet been effectively distributed. Various merchants and firms are purchasing large quantities of goods from Wuhu and Liyang, but they are currently being blocked on the way. Rice shops are still closed. Although there are underground transactions, there is a real shortage of goods. On the 10th, the public sale office in Ximen was crowded with people, and two shi of rice were emptied. In the afternoon, the county government convened an economic conference and decided that all 20,000 shi of grain borrowed by middle peasants in Changzhou from four firms, including Chengyuxin and Yicheng, and more than 10,000 shi of grain claimed by the Central Cooperative Bank to be processed in Changzhou, will be temporarily suspended from export to stabilize the grain market and reassure the people.

### Three Snakes, Dragon, Tiger, Phoenix

— Lao Dan

After the fragrance of sweet osmanthus and the yellow chrysanthemum season, it is the season for the Yangcheng Lake hairy crab to be on the market in Jiangnan. However, in the cities of Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau in South China, the "Three Snakes, Dragon, Tiger Association" begins to serve customers. The so-called "three snakes" refers to the three poisonous snakes of gold-ringed krait, cobra, and green tree snake. It is said that the gold-ringed krait tonifies the legs, the cobra tonifies the middle body, and the green tree snake tonifies the head. The snake's venom is secreted from the gums. The snake catcher first removes the snake's fangs, so the snake has no way to release venom.

To cook the snake, first take the gall bladder, skin it, debone it, and shred it. Then add shredded dried shiitake mushrooms, tree ears, bamboo shoots, ham, and dried tangerine peel. Stew it. When eating, add some fresh lemon leaf shreds as a flavoring. Each person receives a small bowl to eat. The taste is extremely delicious. If the host does not explain in advance, the first-time eater will never know it is snake soup, but will only praise the delicious flavor.

Snake bile is drunk with wine. It is sweet and cool in nature, without a bitter taste. It has the function of dispelling wind and removing dampness. It can be prepared with dried tangerine peel, pepper, ginger, etc., or steeped in wine. The effect is the same.

If cooking snake with masked palm civet (wild cat), black-boned chicken, etc., it is called the "Three Snakes, Dragon, Tiger, Phoenix" grand meeting. There are also places that sell stewed masked palm civet separately, which is also a tonic in winter.

Because the number of snake eaters in Guangdong increases every year, the province's snake production has decreased. In recent years, snakes have mostly been captured and sold from Guangxi. Some cunning restaurants use water snake or toad meat to impersonate it. The taste is the same, but the effect is different.

Some sellers of snake meat, fearing that customers will say that they are selling fakes, will bring live snakes from a lead wire basket and slaughter them in front of them, or leave some of the skin untanned after slaughtering the snake to prove its authenticity. This refers to the full set of fresh three snakes.

Two or three days after eating snake, the skin pores on the body seem to secrete a very thin liquid. It is felt when changing underwear or bathing. This is the effect of snake dispelling wind and removing dampness. Snake meat is rich in protein. It is very beneficial for people who are weak.

In addition to the three snakes, there is also the large gold-spotted snake, which is more than ten feet long and as thick as a person's arm. Three or four days before slaughtering the snake, it is advertised. Because the snake weighs dozens of kilograms, it is not easy to slaughter and sell it unless there are many customers. Its cooking is similar to that of the three snakes, but the value is higher than the three snakes, because it is not common to catch.

(A few days ago, when talking about eating dog meat, I forgot to write about the taboo, that is, anyone who eats dog meat must absolutely not eat mung bean soup (porridge) within twelve hours, otherwise the dog meat will swell in the intestines and stomach, causing severe pain in mild cases and death in severe cases. This is a taboo that dog meat eaters should remember.)

### Public Opinion Polls

— Zhong Jian

Recently, Truman's unexpected victory in the US presidential election astonished and dismayed many political observers and public opinion polling organizations. The Gallup poll, which has a strong international reputation, also declared its failure. Therefore, poll expert Mr. Gallup had to quip, "Such closely contested elections occur only once in a generation, often misleading pollsters." (United Press International, New York, 3rd of this month) Now, Mr. Gallup is studying the reasons for the polling failure. I would like to briefly introduce the public opinion polling organizations in the United States here:

Public opinion polling is essentially an applied technique in social psychology, seeking a comprehensive and concrete conclusion representing group activities from a small number of subjects. It employs systematic methods to ask interviewees a number of concise and to-the-point questions. The question formats include question-and-answer, true-false, and multiple-choice, used in various combinations. The accuracy of the poll does not depend on the number of people interviewed, but on the carefully selected representative individuals. If the selection is appropriate, a few hundred voters can predict the national election. American public opinion polling organizations generally poll between 1,500 and 5,000 people. Gallup often uses 3,000 people, but sometimes uses 60,000.

Among American public opinion polling organizations, the most reputable is undoubtedly the "American Institute of Public Opinion" founded by Gallup in 1935. In addition, the public opinion polls conducted by Fortune magazine and Princeton University are also well-known. The funding for most American public opinion polling organizations is provided by newspapers, and they are run by universities or semi-public organizations. Gallup's funding comes from more than one hundred newspapers across the United States, Fortune magazine's poll funding is provided by the company, and the Princeton University Office of Public Opinion Research's funding comes from grants from the Rockefeller Foundation.

Early public opinion polls were conducted by mailing postcards, but only about a quarter were returned. Therefore, in recent years, most have switched to interviewers who visit homes directly. Less than one-tenth of people refuse to be interviewed. Gallup has 1,200 field interviewers distributed throughout the United States, 200 each in the United Kingdom and Canada, and about 150 in Australia. A single public opinion poll takes ten days across the United States. The United Kingdom is smaller, so it can be completed in four or five days. Gallup's interviewers are all university graduates, and they all have regular jobs. Public opinion polling is a part-time job.

After the interview work is completed, interviewers from each district send the answers back. After a process of collecting, statistically analyzing, and verifying the data, the polling organization officially publishes the results. American newspapers treat reports from public opinion polls like news, selecting the best to publish. If someone believes that the polling report is inaccurate or biased, the public opinion polling organization welcomes verification to clarify the truth and demonstrate an impartial and unbiased stance.

### Trial by Ordeal, Trial by Combat, Trial by Battle

— Li Li

In Halm's "History of Medieval Europe," on page 129, there is an introduction to the barbaric methods of trying cases.

The first is "Trial by Ordeal": This is different from the current "extorting confessions by torture." Instead, for criminals already sentenced to death, before execution, the person sentenced to death could request to "go through fire and water." If they were not injured, it was considered a divine blessing, and they could be spared death, only to be exiled.

The second is "Trial by Combat": After the judge accepted the case, if there was no clear evidence for judgment, the plaintiff and defendant would decide by duel. Lawsuits between nobles were fought on horseback, with lances, and wearing armor. Lawsuits between commoners were fought on foot with clubs. In lawsuits involving women or monks, each would send a representative to fight. If the case being disputed was a civil matter, then the loser of the duel would be considered to have lost the lawsuit. In addition to giving up the object of their dispute, they would also have to pay a fine. If a representative (representing a woman or monk) participated in the duel, then the loser would have one hand chopped off, to prevent these hired duelists from being bribed by the other party. If the case being disputed was criminal, the defendant who lost the duel would be considered to have lost the lawsuit. If the defendant won, then the plaintiff would have to suffer the punishment that the defendant would have received if they had lost.

The third is "Trial by Battle": If the defendant in a criminal case did not accept the verdict, they could appeal to the highest feudal court. However, the defendant who did not accept the initial verdict had to risk "Trial by Battle." The so-called "Trial by Battle" was that the defendant had to fight against all the personnel of the lower court (the initial trial court), one by one. If they could win each battle, then the judges of that court would be sentenced to death, and the court would not be allowed to be established again. If the defendant who initiated the "Trial by Battle" lost even once in the battle, they would be immediately executed.

### Green Crow

— Ma Qin Zhanweng

Unable to dispel the siege with songs of horses and wind, ten thousand wells of the Jianghuai enter misty rain. In desolate villages, tigers are full and the exhausted people are all gone. In night tents, the thunderous joy of brave warriors returns. The two borders divide the power of the world in half. The customs of the four barbarians have changed for a hundred years. White foxes leap and yellow foxes stand. The green bird comes from the west, I fear it is weary from flying.

### Mountain Moving Ballad

It is said that an old man in Gan said to people: The people of Jiangxi do not want Mount Lu, it would be best to move this mountain away. Inspired to write this.

Too much trouble at my door because of this famous mountain, especially since cloud carriages come and go as they please. The old man's song is endless, of all the mountains in the world, the Five Sacred Mountains should be completely removed.

### In Praise of Quitting Smoking

— Qian Dacheng

A month or two ago, I wrote an article "The Difficulty of Quitting Smoking" which was published in "Free Talk." At that time, because cigarettes were too expensive, I advocated smoking water pipes, and many readers expressed sympathy for me. But I never quit cigarettes. Today, times are different, and cigarettes are becoming more expensive day by day, while the income of poor scholars is decreasing day by day. Buying cigarettes even requires secretly going to the black market, and relying on personal connections. All my life, I have been proud and unyielding, unwilling to ask for help from others. But I would rather have to rely on others for cigarettes. Moreover, I am not a die-hard addict. Since buying cigarettes is very difficult and my purse is also shy, I have been nagged by my wife countless times for smoking, and I don't know how many times I have burned holes in my clothes. Today, when I finished my last cigarette, I decided to quit smoking again. As for whether quitting smoking will hinder my writing, I can't care about that. "Articles in troubled times are worthless," so why bother writing sour articles? As for inspiration, the inspiration stimulated by stimulants is not lasting.

Some people say, "A cigarette after a meal is better than being a living immortal." I don't believe it. Didn't Ji Kang also say, "Immortals can be learned"? But what was his result? Was it really a corpse liberation? I never trust the words of immortals. Others say, "A cigarette in hand, thoughts flow freely," the so-called "endless birth and death seen in the smoke." But I think it is better to be neither born nor die, to close the door and let go. I am determined to quit smoking, to show my determination, my ability, and my perseverance. Heaven and earth, help me and support me. Amen!

### A Match Made in Heaven

— Qiang

The acquaintance of General Clay, the commander of the US occupation forces in Germany, and his wife, Marjorie McConaughy, was very interesting and can be considered a contemporary celebrity anecdote.

When Clay was still studying at West Point, the beautiful Miss McConaughy went to the military academy to see a friend. She arrived by bus. When the bus stopped, Clay happened to be standing near the bus. When she got off the bus, she accidentally stumbled and fell right into Clay's arms. He helped her up, introduced himself, and the two fell in love at first sight. They got married on the day Clay graduated.
