### Jinan Outskirts Battle Opens: Bandits Launch Offensive with 180,000 Troops; National Army Prepares and Holds Strong

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 16th] The 700,000 residents of Jinan, who were planning to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival in two evenings, were awakened from their sleep on the evening of the 15th by the sound of heavy artillery. The offensive against Jinan by Chen Yi's bandit forces, which had been brewing for over two months, was officially launched at 11 p.m. on the 15th. The Chen bandit forces mobilized eight columns, along with local communist forces, totaling 180,000 men. The 9th, 13th, and Bohai columns, along with the Qinghui and Qinghe independent regiments, attacked Guodian in the east of Jinan and Longdong in the southeast, the two camps of Dongxiwu and Shangxiagang, and the Tangwu Daokou and Dongjiazhuang (about 10 to 20 kilometers from Jinan) areas north of Guodian. The 10th, New 8th, and Cui Ziming's New 11th columns, the New 2nd and 7th regiments, the Taichang Detachment, etc., attacked Changqing in the west of Jinan, Qingyangshu south of Guide, and the local communist Hui militia groups 11th, 12th, and New 2nd regiments, etc., attacked Queshan and Qihe on the north bank of the Shi River. The 3rd, 6th, and Rapid columns were stationed in the Tai'an-Yanzhou area in the central section of the Jinpu Railway as the general reserve force for all parties. However, because Commander Wang Yaowu personally returned to Jinan from Nanjing by special plane at 9 p.m. on the 15th after the alarm and took command, actively responding to the battle, the communist bandit offensive had been thwarted by the evening of the 16th. The morale of the National Army was high, and they clearly held an absolute advantage. In addition, the Jinan Military Police Inspection Office, in order to strengthen the city's defenses, not only moved the curfew time forward by one hour from today, changing it to 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning, but also installed landmines around the protective structures of the city defense works, warning citizens not to approach.

[Another Dispatch] The prelude to the great battle on the outskirts of Jinan officially opened on the evening of the 15th. In addition to the Chen bandit's 9th, 13th, New 8th, 11th (i.e., Cui Ziming's force), and Bohai columns, which were originally based on the outskirts of Jinan, parts of the bandit's 10th, 3rd, and 6th columns, which were previously based in the Dongping and Jining areas, and local communist forces had also rushed to participate in the battle. The military estimates their total strength to be about 180,000 men. The battle was most fierce from 11 p.m. on the 15th until dawn. The thunderous artillery fire shook the surrounding areas. At 7 a.m., the air force of the National Army was dispatched, and the battle eased slightly. As of the evening of the 16th, the National Army still guarded Guodian and Longdong in the east, Zhangxia and Zhonggong in the south, Queshan and Qihe in the north, and the Changqing positions in the west, with no changes from before.

[Another Dispatch] The bandit's 1st, 4th, and Liangguang columns, which were originally based near Chengwu in southwestern Shandong, had fled to Jining. The Rapid Column, which was originally based in Yuncheng, had fled to Yanzhou. The 7th Column was based in Tengxian. This move by the bandits seemed to be an attempt to block the powerful corps of the National Army from advancing north from Lincheng at any time.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] Chen Bandit forces in northern Jiangsu were badly defeated by the National Army. Their 2nd Column had fled across the Yi River to the Feixian area in southern Shandong, and their 12th Column had also fled to the area north of Tancheng.

### Number of Travelers to Hong Kong Sharply Declines

Guangzhou Also Plans to Implement Exit Regulations

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 16th] Due to the new exit regulations promulgated by China, the number of travelers coming to Hong Kong by plane or ship from Shanghai has sharply declined. However, it is reported that some "tigers" are still able to circumvent the restrictions and arrive here. It is said that "tigers" and others either fly from Nanjing to Guangzhou, or take the Yuehan Railway train from Hankou to Guangzhou, and then come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou, so they do not need to apply for permits in Shanghai. It is reported that the Guangzhou authorities also plan to implement these regulations.

### Mischief by Nomadic People: Fires Break Out Everywhere in Tianshan Pine Forests, a Scenic Spot in Xinjiang

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 16th] A reporter recently traveled to Tianshan Lake, a famous scenic spot in Xinjiang Province, for a four-day trip. I feel that there are several things that can be reported to the people of the country: (1) Tianshan Lake is located under Bogda Peak, surrounded by cliffs and ancient pine forests. Unfortunately, due to the mischief of nomadic people, fires break out everywhere in the pine forests, with a tendency to spread. Now, the iron-tiled temple around the famous Tianshan Lake is surrounded by flames, burning wildly in the wind. It is feared that the iron-tiled temple buildings will also be affected this winter. (2) The current water storage capacity of Tianshan Lake is more than 15 million cubic meters. If the lake water can be discharged with mechanized equipment, it can irrigate millions of acres of farmland in northern Xinjiang. (3) There are abundant coal and iron ore deposits in the mountains. The reporter met several geological survey personnel in Tianshan Lake who were working in the mountains. According to them, they had gained a lot. However, Tianshan Lake is not only a scenic area, but also can become an industrial area in the future if hydropower can be used. However, it depends on the efforts of the Chinese people.

### Diligence and Frugality Emphasize Vigorous Implementation to Change the Atmosphere: The President's Call Is Like a Strong Cardiac Injection

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] After President Chiang launched the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Frugality, calling on the people of the country to abandon luxury, reduce corruption, advocate economy, and actively build, reporters recently interviewed legislators, university professors, and social celebrities in Nanjing, such as Chen Yuguang, Zhang Qingzhen, Zou Shuwen, and Chen Guyuan, to ask for their opinions and views. The records are as follows:

Chen Yuguang believes that the diligence and frugality of the Chinese people is an absolutely necessary way of life in the revolutionary process. The opportunity to promote frugality has been lost three times in the past, but he said, "It is never too late to mend the fold. This time, the government is promoting the frugality movement in a planned, step-by-step, and methodical manner. In other words, it is a thorough reform of the extravagant life of the wealthy, and it will surely win the enthusiastic support of the people of the country." He concluded, "The diligence and frugality movement emphasizes vigorous implementation. As long as we are willing to work hard and earnestly implement every covenant, there is no reason why we cannot suppress the rebellion and build the country."

Zhang Qingzhen said, "The National Construction Movement of Diligence and Frugality is not only giving a strong cardiac injection to the current corrupt and numb society. This time, President Chiang launched the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Frugality, which is aimed at irrational phenomena. The suffering of the general people has become unbearable to hear. They only hope to have food and clothing, but they are unable to do so. This movement has been launched by President Chiang, and is earnestly advocated. It is indeed speaking for the majority of the people, and is a strong cardiac injection to society." Zhang's view on the nature of this movement is: "This is a moral movement. Inspiring everyone's conscience to control consumption and reduce enjoyment is more thorough and profound than the law. At the same time, the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Frugality is a movement to shift the atmosphere. Changing the atmosphere is the most thorough way."

Although Zou Shuwen's long beard brushes his chest, his spirit and physical strength are still as vigorous as a young man. His clothes are simple and unadorned. He said, "This movement is a top priority, and everyone has the responsibility to promote it. He deeply hates the extravagant and luxurious behavior of the wealthy. He said that at a time when the country's materials are extremely scarce and the general people have no food or clothing, we cannot allow a few wealthy people to waste. Many people have long paid attention to this. For example, at a meeting, someone mentioned that government officials who take cars could change to rickshaws. Director Yu of the Supervisory Yuan immediately expressed his approval. He believes that at least in the absence of an emergency, gasoline should not be wasted."

Chen Guyuan said: Diligence and frugality are personal habits, but they can also form social customs, and depend on automatic self-cultivation. After the currency reform, we should immediately work hard to promote production in a positive way, in order to guarantee the success of the reform. In a passive way, we must rely on the whole country to diligently and frugally economize. This time, the economization movement should focus more on saving foreign exchange, automobiles, and gasoline. The daily consumption is astonishing. At present, there is indeed a lot of waste among car users in Nanjing and Shanghai. He supports the use of rickshaws by legislators. Chen has been diligent, frugal, and simple for decades. He earnestly hopes that this national construction movement can become popular throughout the country and see its success as soon as possible.

Editorial

### Sale of Stocks of State-Owned Enterprises

The principle of selling state-owned enterprises was established as early as the Economic Emergency Measures Plan of February 17, Year 36 [1947]. Subsequent economic reform plans and financial reports have consistently regarded it as a means to absorb idle capital and balance the budget. With the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Measures on August 19, particular emphasis was placed on balancing the national budget and designating state-owned enterprise assets as part of the gold yuan currency issuance reserve. Consequently, the stocks of five entities, including China Textile Industries Corporation, were put on sale on the 10th of this month.

Since the public offering began, applications for subscription from various sectors have reportedly been quite enthusiastic, with China Textile Industries Corporation and Taiwan Sugar Corporation stocks being particularly popular. However, comparing the total amount to be sold with the amount already sold reveals a significant difference. This is naturally due to the short timeframe. According to observations and careful analysis from various perspectives, the following factors also appear to play a role:

(1) The internal operations and asset conditions of these state-owned enterprises are not very transparent, and the outside world lacks understanding.

(2) The portion designated for sale only accounts for about two-tenths of the total assets. The actual power of management will still be held by government shares.

(3) Regulations require China Textile Industries Corporation, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and other stocks to be in minimum units of five shares. Each share costs 100 gold yuan, equivalent to a substantial 1.5 billion legal tender, putting them beyond the reach of small individual investors.

(4) Currently, the issuance location is limited to Shanghai, and within Shanghai, only five banks and bureaus are handling the issuance, which is not widespread enough.

(5) Many are buying stocks for short-term capital management rather than long-term investment. With the stock market not yet open, there is fear that it will be difficult to sell, hindering the utilization of funds.

These are the general views. Therefore, a large-scale promotion of these stocks still requires technical improvements. How to improve? In practical terms, whether or not the stock can be listed on the stock market is most important. If the stock exchange cannot be restored due to the need to stabilize prices, other aspects must find ways to increase the interest of general investors.

The authorities plan to issue 200 million gold yuan in China Textile Industries Corporation shares, 300 million gold yuan in China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shares, 48 million gold yuan in Taiwan Sugar Corporation shares, 12 million gold yuan in Taiwan Paper Corporation shares, and 4 million gold yuan in Tianjin Paper Corporation shares, totaling 564 million gold yuan. According to general estimates and official declarations, this amount roughly corresponds to the total amount of legal tender collected and the gold yuan currency already issued nationwide. Therefore, reducing idle capital and stabilizing prices should be most effectively achieved through this approach. Without violating the basic premise of the new economic measures, we believe any possible measures should be considered and adopted to achieve the intended goals.

Since the currency reform, everyone has been worried about the abundance of idle capital, considering it the greatest threat to economic stability. Everyone also agrees that only channeling it into production can put the economy on the right track, truly benefiting the nation and the people. To achieve both goals simultaneously – absorbing idle capital and engaging everyone in production – there is no other effective method except encouraging people to use their surplus funds to buy these stocks. This is an existing enterprise, eliminating the need for initiation and preparation to establish a new business; it can immediately provide a legitimate outlet for idle funds in the market. Moreover, it is a large-scale enterprise, vastly different in difficulty and speed from starting new, small-scale businesses and recruiting investors piecemeal. Therefore, each company should promptly and openly disclose its internal realities to increase public confidence. At the same time, the benefits for commercial shareholders should be particularly increased to enhance interest. Other aspects, such as expanding sales locations and facilitating stock trading, should also be continuously sought and improved. If one can be considerate and cater to the interests of buyers, we believe the sales of these stocks will undoubtedly flourish and break previous records. Since August 19, the stock exchange has been closed, and off-exchange trading has been repeatedly banned. However, according to newspaper reports, the black market for stocks does not seem to have been completely eliminated. It shows that there is not much difficulty in promoting these stocks; it is only necessary to make everyone aware that buying these stocks is indeed profitable and easy to trade.

### Britain Closes Consulate in Macau

Consul Rabbitts Transferred to Shanghai

### Trial of Tao Qiming Case Opens Yesterday; Yuan Yang'an Granted Bail

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] After the complete record of the investigation of the currency reform leak case was transferred to the Capital District Prosecutor's Office, Prosecutor Tian Jihou reviewed it overnight and opened the trial at 8:00 AM on the 16th, concluding at 4:00 PM. As a result, Yuan Yang'an was granted bail of 10,000 gold yuan, as his involvement was deemed less severe. Prosecutor Tian first questioned Tao Qiming, who still wore sunglasses, a gray suit, and white leather shoes, appearing quite haggard. Xu Baiqi's hair was disheveled, and his suit and tie were untied, appearing distressed. Both men carefully considered their answers to the prosecutor's questions. However, due to strict security, the details of the interrogation are unknown. It is reported that the two men argued about leaking information and profiting from it. Yuan Yang'an was granted bail due to his lighter involvement. According to the prosecutor originally assigned to the case by the Special Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office, before the police department transferred the entire file to the Special Criminal Court, he had informally questioned them based on the reports in the newspapers. Xu and Tao had frankly admitted to their actions and had not objected to the police's use of scientific instruments during the interrogation. The police statements had been signed and approved by the defendants, so it was unlikely that they would retract their original confessions. Therefore, the progress of the case seemed quite clear. The transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office was necessary due to legal procedures, and the Special Criminal Court handling the case would be illegal.

[Our Report] After Yuan Yang'an was released on bail, his family in Shanghai stated that Yuan still had private matters to attend to in Nanjing and would return to Shanghai in the coming days.

Preparations are being actively made, and it is expected that all students from eastern Henan will be sent for reinstatement within a week.

### New Development in the War Situation

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released a report on the war situation for the week of September 9-15. The full text is as follows:

(1) New Situation: Since the Chen-Liu bandit forces suffered a heavy blow in the Central Plains Battle in early July, their vitality has been greatly damaged. Although they have been actively reorganizing and preparing for another battle, their strength is limited due to the excessive number of new recruits, so they did not dare to act recklessly in February. There have been no major battles in the country. Over the past week, the bandit's reorganization seems to have come to an end, and there is a situation of launching counter-offensives in central Shandong, western Henan, central Shanxi, and western Liaoning. Over the past month, the National Army has been actively implementing reforms, improving the system, training, supplies, and treatment. The combat effectiveness is increasing day by day, and the morale of the front-line troops is strong. Officers and soldiers have a new understanding of the work of suppressing bandits and the tactics of fighting bandits. In the past half month, they have taken the initiative in northern Anhui, northern Hubei, eastern Henan, and northern Jiangsu to launch offensives against the bandits. The bandit army is panicked. The bandits originally in northern Jiangsu and eastern Henan did not dare to resist and fled to southern and western Shandong in a panic. The center of the war shifted to Shandong, and a new situation was formed.

(2) Battle of Central Shandong Imminent: The battles in eastern China, northern Jiangsu, and eastern Henan are coming to an end. The focus of the war has gradually shifted north to central Shandong. Currently, there are about five columns of bandit troops gathered around Jinan, and nearly nine columns of bandits on both sides of the Jinpu Railway in central Shandong, totaling about 300,000 people. On the one hand, they are trying to attack Jinan and strike our reinforcements. On the other hand, they are gathering troops to launch a counter-offensive on the Longhai Line. The battle is about to begin and will be the second decisive battle in central China. The war may be longer than the previous Central Plains Battle. Chen's bandit forces will suffer a more miserable defeat than the previous battle, because the National Army is fully prepared, and it is not difficult to defeat the bandit's various attempts and conspiracies.

(3) Bandits in Western Henan Attempt to Flee: The Liu Bocheng bandit army in western Henan has recently gathered its forces one after another, totaling eight columns plus one army, with a total of 200,000 people. Most of them are gathered in the area of Xiangcheng and Fangcheng on the west side of the Pinghan Road, actively preparing for war, or may soon flee north and south. The National Army is prepared in all aspects to give them a head-on blow.

(4) North China Battlefield, Eastern Hebei: The Nie bandit forces that fled along the Pinggu line, after being severely attacked by our army, their 4th Brigade of the 2nd Column and the main force of the 4th Column fled to the area of Sanhe County. After being attacked by our army from two directions, the bandits were wounded again and retreated east of Pinggu. The 11th Column of the Li Yunchang bandits, together with the troops of the 13th Military Sub-District of the bandit, fled to Anshan, Shimen, Changli, and other places on the morning of the 13th to cause disturbances. The Shimen local defense team withdrew once on the 13th, but after reinforcements arrived, the area was recovered after five hours of suppression. In recent days, our land and air forces have been cooperating and launching fierce counterattacks against the bandits in that area. The battle is still ongoing.

Taiyuan: There have been no major battles this week. Most of the Nie bandit's 1st and 2nd Columns moved to the Datong area. Also, our air force occasionally flew to the bandit-held areas of Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, Pingyao, Jiexiu, and other bandit rear areas for reconnaissance and bombing, destroying many bandit vehicles, and hitting the headquarters of the 45th Brigade of the 15th Column of the bandit.

(5) Northeast Battlefield, Jinxi: The 27th Division of the 9th Column of the bandit, together with the bandit units of the 6th Independent and 8th Independent, in order to coordinate the disturbances of the bandit army in the Guannei section of the Beining Road, crossed the Daling River from Zhangbibao on the 12th and fled to the southwest area of Yixian (northwest of Jinzhou). That night, a part of it came into contact with our national army in Erhupao. Since the 13th, they have been fleeing to Xingcheng and other places. The bandit's 4th Independent Division and the 18th Military Sub-District troops also joined the battle. The battle is taking place in the area of Hanjiagou, northeast of Xingcheng. The 7th and 10th Columns of the bandits in Liaobei are all moving to western Liaoning. There may be a major battle in western Liaoning. At the moment, our army has advanced in several routes to suppress the bandits fleeing in that area, and it will not be difficult to repel them.

Changchun: The bandits are frequently mobilizing and transporting goods outside the city. The number of bandits in the area has been increasing recently. Their purpose seems to be to continue to besiege Changchun, waiting for the severe cold weather to cause difficulties for us in food and fuel, and then carry out conspiracies. However, the National Army is prepared, and it is not easy for the bandits to achieve their goals.

### The West Demands Resolution of the Berlin Problem; Soviet Union Adopts Delaying Tactics; Three Ambassadors' Meeting with Stalin Unsuccessful

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Diplomatic observers here said today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will hold new consultations with representatives of the three Western countries in the afternoon for four hours. On the one hand, it is also said that the governments of the three countries have issued new instructions to their representatives in the Soviet Union. However, these people believe that it is doubtful whether any kind of agreement can be reached before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. It is also said that an agreement is only possible if the Soviet Union is prepared to adopt a completely different and more conciliatory attitude.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] According to well-informed sources, Stalin is currently recuperating at his Georgia villa in Goxi. It is said that Stalin left the Kremlin a few days ago and will be away for about a month.

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Western diplomats say that the decisive four-power talks on the Berlin blockade will move from Moscow to Paris in early next week to prepare for a showdown. They pointed out that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the British ambassador Roberts, who participated in the Moscow talks, will both attend the UN General Assembly. At the same time, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will also attend the meeting, so the Berlin dispute may be raised for the highest-level discussions. In London diplomatic circles, it is predicted that there will be at least one more meeting in the Kremlin. It is said that Stalin is not currently in Moscow, but the British side believes that it makes little difference whether Stalin attends or not. He can still participate in the talks at any time when appropriate. Diplomatic circles also said that Western countries have agreed to present the Soviet Union with a note that is virtually equivalent to an ultimatum, demanding the immediate lifting of the Berlin blockade, otherwise the negotiations will collapse. They said that in the most recent meeting, Western representatives complained about the actions of the Berlin Communists. Molotov only listened attentively. Almost all the speeches in the entire meeting were made by Western representatives.

[Associated Press, London, 16th] It is understood that in the last Kremlin meeting, Western representatives insisted that the Soviet Union should order the Soviet military governor in Germany to abide by the original instructions issued by Moscow. Molotov asked for more time to study and be able to respond later. However, Western representatives insisted that there should be no delay and that the meeting should be held again immediately. Diplomatic circles believe that Molotov has three paths to follow. He can answer "No" and cause the Moscow talks to collapse. He can also answer "Yes" and order Marshal Sokolovsky to abide by the original instructions. He can also give an insincere answer, accept one or two details, and propose counter-suggestions to delay the negotiations. Diplomatic circles believe that the Soviet Union does not intend to give a definite answer and is buying time.

### India-Hyderabad Dispute Added to Security Council Agenda; China's Request for Postponement Denied

[Our Correspondent] London, 16th (via radio from Paris): The Security Council convened an emergency meeting on the 16th to discuss Hyderabad's accusation of Indian aggression. The meeting began at 3:00 PM, chaired by Malik. After the opening formalities, Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu, citing a lack of instructions from his government, requested a four-day postponement of the discussion, but this was denied. The Soviet representative then requested that the Security Council first discuss the legal status of Hyderabad before deciding whether it had the authority to handle the case. However, some representatives argued that the question of the Security Council's authority should be decided later. A vote was taken, and it was passed to include the Hyderabad case on the agenda.

[United Press, Paris, 16th] The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting at 3:30 PM this afternoon to try to prevent Indian aggression against Hyderabad before further bloodshed occurs.

Major powers have remained silent on how they hope to restore peace in Hyderabad, but they have clearly decided to bring the dispute to a public vote to avert more serious trends.

[United Press, London, 15th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed regret in the House of Commons regarding India's "belligerent" attitude toward Hyderabad, saying, "In that place, it is equally unknown how it will end." He stated that Britain believes the India-Hyderabad dispute should be submitted to the United Nations, but he did not intend to comment further, as Sir Gladwyn Jebb would preside over the Hyderabad issue at the Security Council in Paris on the 16th.

### Marshall Expresses Concern Over India-Hyderabad Conflict

Pakistan to Issue Declaration

[United Press, New Delhi, 16th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall declared in Washington that the United States is quite concerned about the Hyderabad situation but denied rumors that the U.S. would submit the matter to the United Nations General Assembly in Paris. An important declaration is expected to be issued from Karachi, the capital of Pakistan.

### Indian Troops Only 65 Miles from Hyderabad Capital

India Establishes Administrative Institutions in Occupied Areas

[United Press, New Delhi, 16th] The Indian Army Headquarters stated on the 16th that Indian armored units are advancing within Hyderabad, overcoming "strong resistance," and are now only 65 miles from the city of Hyderabad. The military stated that the Indian Air Force is "actively supporting" ground forces, thoroughly bombing Hyderabad's main airports. It also stated that Hyderabad city has not been bombed. The government stated that civilian officials are advancing with the troops, establishing Indian administrative institutions in the occupied areas.

### Nehru Expresses Gratitude for British Warship Acquisition

[Agence France-Presse, Bombay, 15th] At the ceremony where the Indian Navy received a cruiser donated by Britain, Indian Prime Minister Nehru gave a speech stating, "In the current situation, it is not enough merely to hope for peace; we must strive for peace. India must protect its hard-won independence."

### Soviet Union Controls Southeast Asia Intelligence Bureau, Strengthening Soviet Position in the Far East to Gain a Voice in Far East Peace Conference

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Well-informed sources declared on the 16th that, according to secret information from the Far East, the Southeast Asia branch of the Comintern Intelligence Bureau began operations in May. It is speculated that the headquarters of the Southeast Asia branch is located within the Soviet embassy in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, as the Soviet Union maintains approximately 40 people within the embassy, despite having no significant economic interests in Thailand.

U.S. officials stated that since the Soviet embassy was established in Bangkok in May, communist activities in Southeast Asia have become increasingly active. The scope of the Comintern Intelligence Bureau's Southeast Asia branch is generally believed to include Thailand, Burma, Malaya, Indochina, and the East Indies. In each of these regions, communist-inspired disturbances erupted one after another during the summer, and in Indonesia, the peaceful efforts of the United Nations Committee of Good Offices were severely undermined. According to information obtained here, the strategy adopted by the communists in Asian colonial regions is no different from that in Europe. In each region, all activities are directed by one or more Soviet-trained personnel. Such personnel may hold official positions or may be underground operatives. For example, in French Indochina, Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Viet Minh Republic, studied in Moscow for four years; in Indonesia, the cunning indigenous leader Alimin was trained by the Soviets. Diplomats here believe that the communist activities are intended to strengthen the Soviet Union's mandate to gain a voice in the Far East peace conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had already declared that, based on the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan, the Soviet Union should be granted a major role, including veto power, in the final peace in Asia, a stance firmly opposed by the four powers of China, Britain, the United States, and France.

### Dutch Foreign Minister to Fly to the U.S. to Meet with Marshall

To Discuss Indonesian Communist Activities

[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press] Diplomatic sources here stated that Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker is scheduled to fly from The Hague to the United States on the afternoon of the 16th and will meet with Secretary of State Marshall on the same day to discuss the growing "Indonesian Communist activities." This sudden and unannounced visit is of great significance, and the Dutch government apparently believes it necessary to send Stikker before the United Nations General Assembly convenes in Paris.

### Seoul Under Special Martial Law to Prevent Communist Riots

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 16th] In view of recent reports that communists will incite riots in South Korea during the UN General Assembly session in an attempt to demonstrate the weakness and unpopularity of the South Korean government to the UN General Assembly, the Korean authorities have announced the implementation of special martial law in the Seoul area.

### Taiwan-Japan Material Exchange

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The 200 million yen barter trade between Japan and Taiwan has been approved by the Allied Headquarters. One hundred million yen will be used to export pharmaceuticals, bicycles, miscellaneous goods, and machinery from Japan, while Taiwan will supply Japan with timber, rice, salt, sand, sugar, and camphor.

### Soviet Union Reopens the Issue of Demanding Discussion on Disarmament

[United Press, Paris, 16th] A few days before the opening of the General Assembly in Paris, the Soviet Union reopened the issue on the 16th, again proposing a global disarmament plan that encompasses East-West disputes. Western countries, citing the current international situation, argued earlier this year that a slight reduction in armaments was impossible and prompted the adjournment of the United Nations Commission for Conventional Armaments. Now, Soviet representative Malik is requesting an early convening of the commission. The commission, composed of eleven countries and identical to the Security Council, must meet at least once before the General Assembly opens on the 21st. The commission will hear reports reflecting the vastly different views of the West and the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament.

### Political Crisis Remains Latent; French Labor Unrest on the Rise; New Cabinet Under Attack from Both Left and Right

[United Press, Paris, 16th] Communist-led French workers launched a series of new strikes on the 16th, bringing the number of striking workers close to 200,000, in an attempt to undermine Prime Minister Queuille's austere new economic plan.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] The strike that brought the Renault factory to a standstill on the 15th will spread to all steel factories in the Paris region this afternoon. The strike by ground staff at Air France, which began on the afternoon of the 15th, has not yet resumed this morning. Union sources emphasize that although the current labor unrest is still partial in nature, the general trend of demanding wage increases cannot be ignored. The Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), currently controlled by the communists, is the main force supporting the union strikes.

Yesterday's clash between 2,000 workers and 600 police officers at the Snark aircraft factory in central Paris has further altered the political situation and may have an adverse impact on monetary issues and cabinet stability. Observers here point out that under the dual impact of the economic situation and worker demands, the cabinet may lose some supporters in parliament when it seeks parliamentary authorization to increase the tax burden on taxpayers. In this difficult situation, the French Communist Party and the Gaullists are launching a full-scale offensive against the current cabinet. The French Communist Party is convening meetings across the country, calling for the formation of a new government that includes the Communist Party. On the other hand, the Gaullists are marching in southern France, launching a "Save France" movement.

### Independence Movement in Hokkaido Worries Japan and Allied Headquarters

Residents of the Island Lean Towards Communism

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The Japanese government and the Allied Headquarters are now paying attention to the independence movement in Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan. The authorities have begun investigating the source of recent propaganda books promoting the island's independence, believing that there are several reasons why the islanders' dissatisfaction with the authorities has formed the basis for the independence movement. Although the independence movement in Hokkaido is not currently considered a serious problem, both the Japanese government and the Allied Headquarters are deeply concerned because a large percentage of the island's residents are communists or sympathizers.

### Siamese Envoy Arrives in Moscow

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 16th] TASS announced that the Siamese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Nokkaew, has arrived in Moscow.

### Typhoon Strikes Japan

Heavy Rain and Train Stoppages

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] A powerful typhoon swept across much of the three islands of Japan on the 16th, flooding 5,000 homes and threatening the rice harvest. Winds of 60 miles per hour lashed the country, accompanied by heavy rain and train stoppages. The U.S. military has evacuated Americans from dangerous areas. Initial reports indicate that one person has drowned and two have been injured.

### Vyshinsky Returns to Moscow

Fate of Italian Colonies to be Decided by General Assembly

### Measures for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation Regulations Approved

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] The "Supplementary Measures for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation Regulations" submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, after review by the Economic Control Committee of the Executive Yuan, have been revised to the following points for supplementation, which were submitted to the 8th Temporary Meeting of the Executive Yuan for resolution: (1) The title is changed to "Implementation Measures for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation Regulations." (2) The standards for dividing the amount of goods transacted and wages and freight received, as well as the amount of fines, in the original regulations should be re-drafted. Subsequently, the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan and the Secretariat of the Economic Control Committee, together with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, amended the original measures accordingly. The Executive Yuan has now approved them and presented a report at the political affairs meeting on the 15th. The measures are recorded as follows:

(1) All cities and counties nationwide are designated as areas for implementing price limits and price negotiation.

(2) The prices of goods nationwide should be based on the publicly traded prices in the local market on August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar), after conversion to gold yuan at the exchange rate.

Local competent authorities may designate certain types of goods for strict control, depending on the actual supply and demand situation in the area.

(3) Regarding businesses related to people's daily lives, such as hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, barbershops, tailors, laundries, transportation, clinics, hospitals, and movie theaters, the provisions of the preceding article apply, and prices should be controlled.

(4) If, for special reasons, it is necessary to adjust the prices of goods and business operations stipulated in the preceding two or three articles, the local competent authority may organize a Price Evaluation Committee, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Price Evaluation Implementation Regulations, to negotiate fair prices, report them to the local competent authority for approval, and submit them to the competent higher-level authority for record, unless otherwise stipulated by law.

If the prices adjusted before August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar) are excessively high, the local competent authority may re-evaluate them in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph and reduce them.

(5) From August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar), any of the following circumstances shall be deemed a violation of price limits:

(1) The transaction prices of goods and the prices of business operations related to people's daily lives in various places, without the approval of the local superior authorities, exceed the prices converted to gold yuan according to the exchange rate on August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar).

(2) Goods converted to gold yuan according to the exchange rate from August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar) are changed in name, quality, quantity, or price for sale, or the prices converted to gold yuan are not marked as required, or they are secretly sold at high prices.

(3) Other violations of the provisions on price limits and price negotiation.

(6) Article 6, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the Regulations for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation are amended to use 500 gold yuan as the dividing standard. If the price exceeds the negotiated price and the circumstances are serious, or the value of the goods transacted and the wages and freight received is 500 gold yuan or more, it shall be handled in accordance with paragraph 2. If the price exceeds the negotiated price and the value of the goods transacted or the wages and freight received is less than 500 gold yuan, it shall be handled in accordance with paragraph 3.

(Note: The dividing standard stipulated in the regulations is "50,000 yuan," and the original proposal was to change it to "2,000 gold yuan," which would be too high. However, if it is converted according to the price index at the time the original regulations were promulgated, the "50,000 yuan" at that time would only be equivalent to 101.4 gold yuan, which would also be too low. Therefore, it was agreed to revise the proposal as above.)

(7) The fines imposed in accordance with the Regulations for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation shall be allocated as follows, unless handled by the judicial authorities in accordance with the law: 50% shall be used as rewards, and the remaining 50% shall be turned over to the local government treasury.

(8) The local competent authorities responsible for suppressing violations of price limits and price negotiation shall be the Social Affairs Bureau or Social Affairs Department (in conjunction with the public security and police authorities) in municipalities directly under the central government and provincial capitals, and the county or city governments in counties and cities.

### Change of Command at Songhu Garrison Headquarters; Jiang Jingguo Internally Appointed as Successor; Xuan Tiewu Transferred to Deputy Director of Quzhou Pacification Headquarters

[Our Correspondent] Xuan Tiewu's request to resign as commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has been approved, and he has been transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters. Jiang Jingguo has been internally appointed to fill the vacancy of Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. This news has been confirmed to our reporter by Commander Xuan himself. According to Xuan, the responsibilities of the Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters are heavy, and he had intended to resign for some time, but he was not permitted by the President. Before the currency reform, he went to Moganshan to visit the President and request to resign, but the President still did not approve. After returning to Shanghai, he telegraphed the President again, reiterating his previous request. He recently received news from Nanjing that his resignation had been approved, and the President has issued a handwritten order to the Ministry of National Defense. The official order should arrive in Shanghai in about three or four days, and he can be said to have achieved his wish. He has now ordered the heads of various departments of the Garrison Headquarters to prepare for the handover. When asked to express his feelings, Xuan humbly stated that since coming to Shanghai three years ago, he has been grateful for the assistance of the citizens of Shanghai. He feels ashamed to leave before the security of Shanghai has been consolidated. He believes that Jiang Jingguo will have a good performance in the future.

According to a Central News Agency report, people here have expressed excitement about Jiang Jingguo's internal appointment as Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. However, Jiang has not made any statement regarding this news. According to well-informed sources, the Songhu area may implement total war earlier after Jiang takes over as Garrison Commander. Jiang himself will be responsible for political and economic aspects, while military aspects may be the responsibility of the Deputy Commander. It is said that the candidate for Deputy Commander has also been internally appointed.

### Three Parties and Various Circles Telegraph the President, Supporting the Diligence and Frugality Nation-Building Movement, and Appeal to the Nation to Respond with United Effort

Since the President instructed the people in his broadcast the other day that they should build the nation through diligence and frugality, all sectors of the city were deeply moved upon hearing it. It is heard that the Kuomintang City Party Department, as well as the Youth Party and Democratic Socialist Party's two city party departments and various organizations, will hold a meeting next week to discuss the implementation of diligence and frugality in nation-building. In addition, the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party's city party departments telegraphed President Chiang and Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan yesterday, and telegraphed various public organizations nationwide, expressing their sincere support for the diligence and frugality nation-building movement, and appealing to patriotic compatriots nationwide to unite and strive together to respond, make a firm decision, and strive to rise up. The original telegram stated: "To President Chiang of the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan, and the various newspapers, public opinion organizations, and organizations of all kinds: In recent years, our country's production has shrunk, national strength has declined, the lives of the people are as fragile as silk, and the national soul is about to be severed. This is directly due to the rebellion of traitors, the sabotage of spies, and the destruction caused, but the decline of social morals and the immersion of people's hearts in extravagance, luxury, and material desires are also the fundamental factors that have created this phenomenon. The President has unique insight and foresight, and with the enthusiasm to save the country and the people, has issued the call to build the nation through diligence and frugality. His words are earnest and deeply relevant to the current ills, and the ten articles of the covenant he has revealed are a panacea for correcting the times and a good prescription for saving the country. Diligence increases production, and frugality conserves consumption. The way to implement it lies in active work, respecting time, eliminating corruption, and abstaining from extravagance. If everyone can make a firm decision, strive to rise up, encourage and emulate each other, and believe and act together, then the transformation of social morals will not take long, and the restoration of national fortunes can be expected soon. We, deeply mindful of the President's expectations and closely observing the needs of society, will not only sincerely support this movement and supervise our party members to vigorously promote it, but also hope that the people of the country, patriotic compatriots, will unite and strive together. The future of the nation depends on it. A special telegram conveys our thoughts. We hope you will understand. The Shanghai City Party Departments of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chinese Youth Party, and the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party kowtow, Shen Xianyin."

Moreover, all sectors of the city were deeply moved upon hearing the President's broadcast the previous evening advocating diligence and frugality in nation-building. Yesterday (the 16th), they respectfully telegraphed their support. The original text is as follows: "To President Chiang of the Presidential Palace in Nanjing: The root of our country's illness today lies in the disturbances caused by the treacherous Communist bandits and the malfeasance of treacherous merchants and corrupt officials, but the degeneration of social morals, corruption, extravagance, and waste are also contributing factors. The way to save the situation requires a thorough transformation of the public and private lives of the people. Your Excellency, with high courage and foresight, illuminates the profound and advocates economic reform first, followed by frugality and diligence. Treating both the symptoms and the root causes, applying both the essence and the function, your painstaking efforts are admired by all in government and the public. Since receiving the decree to reform the currency system and strictly enforce frugality, this council and others have loudly appealed and widely promoted it, with the aim of warning the world and awakening the masses, and reversing the declining trend. Upon hearing Your Excellency's training on the diligence and frugality nation-building movement, the words are earnest and thought-provoking, enough to inspire the weak and establish the cowardly, and bring the dead back to life. We pledge to support it with sincerity, intensify publicity, promote organization, follow the outline, and universally implement it, so that this epoch-making social revolution movement can be completed quickly and continued without interruption. A respectful telegram is presented, respectfully requesting your attention. The Shanghai City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Federation of Labor Unions, the Women's Association, the Journalists Association, the Education Association, the Farmers Association, Shen Xuan kowtow."

Yesterday afternoon, the Postal Workers' Union held a meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss ways to continue requesting improvement from the authorities. According to central regulations, the salaries and allowances of employees of state-owned enterprises cannot exceed the treatment of public relief personnel by more than 10%. If so, the highest salary of employees of the Shanghai Post Office would be no more than 120 Gold Yuan, and the lowest would be only 18 Gold Yuan. However, employees are requesting that the cost of living index compiled by the post office on August 10 be converted into Gold Yuan, which would result in a maximum salary of about 300 Gold Yuan and a minimum of 70 to 80 Gold Yuan. The difference between the two is huge.

The Bureau of Health Should Pay Attention to Inspection

### Special Court Investigates Zhang Renyou, Focusing on Selling and Releasing Bandit Ships; Three Defendants Request Bail Denied

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Renyou, the Director of the Water Police Branch, Wang Baoqian, the patrol officer of the Beixinjing Police Station of the branch, and Shan Guohua, the Director of the Suzhou River Substation of the branch, were accused by someone to the judicial authorities of having committed the crime of feeding and polluting the bandits, listing ten major crimes. After the District Prosecutor's Office opened a court to investigate the day before yesterday, it was transferred to the Special Criminal Court yesterday morning because the part of supporting the bandits was under the jurisdiction of the Qing Special Criminal Court. Yesterday afternoon, the special court prosecutor began to investigate. The most important part of the case of supporting bandits is the accusation that ships loaded with supplies (supplies are ships from the Mazhou River) passed through Caojialang, Beixinjing, and entered the inland river to supply the bandits. These ships were seized by the police station of the branch near Beixinjing, and were released after bribing 100 taels of gold. The focus of yesterday's prosecutor's investigation was also on this. Zhang et al. were still wearing police uniforms when they were brought in for questioning. They were quite calm. The interrogation time was quite long. Zhang Renyou denied that he had accepted bribes, saying that the ship was reported by the police station and punished according to the Violation of Police Law. Because there are many such incidents every day, it was approved. Wang Baoqian stated that the incident occurred in Beixinjing, and his jurisdiction was in the Caojiadu area, which is more than ten miles away from Beixinjing. This matter is not within his jurisdiction. Shan Guohua stated that according to the report of the police officer who investigated the ship, the ship was only in violation of police regulations and was slightly punished and released. It is not true that it was transporting materials to support bandits. The interrogation ended at 5:35 PM. Zhang et al.'s request for bail was denied, and they were still detained. As for the corruption part, the District Prosecutor's Office will continue to investigate.

### Four Kinds of Conversion Formulas for Capital Amount of Profit-Making Enterprises Proposed; Ministry of Industry and Commerce is Submitting to the Executive Yuan for Approval

[Nanjing, 16th] The calculation formula for converting the capital amount of profit-making enterprises to Gold Yuan has been drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The four conversion formulas are as follows: (1) For companies that were approved for establishment and registration before the 26th year, the conversion formula for the paid-up legal tender capital is: the paid-up capital amount before the 26th year multiplied by the national wholesale price index for the first half of August of the 37th year, divided by the national wholesale price index for the 26th year, and then divided by the legal ratio of legal tender to Gold Yuan. (2) For companies that were approved for establishment and registration in the 27th year and after, the conversion formula for the paid-up legal tender capital is: the paid-up legal tender capital amount in the 27th year and after, multiplied by the national wholesale price index for the first half of August of the 37th year, divided by the national wholesale price index applicable on the date of application for registration, and then divided by the legal ratio of legal tender to Gold Yuan. (3) For companies that have been approved for capital reduction registration, the conversion formula for the paid-up legal tender capital is: the capital amount of the last capital reduction registration, multiplied by the national wholesale price index for the first half of August of the 37th year, divided by the national wholesale price index applicable on the date of application for registration, and then divided by the legal ratio of legal tender to Gold Yuan. (4) For companies that increase capital after the establishment or capital reduction registration, the conversion formula for the increased legal tender capital is: the increased paid-up capital amount, multiplied by the national wholesale price index for the first half of August of the 37th year, divided by the national wholesale price index applicable on the date of application for registration, and then divided by the legal ratio of legal tender to Gold Yuan. The price index data required for calculation has been sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for reference.

Therefore, a "Draft Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year" was prepared and submitted for review, and a request was made to abolish the previously promulgated Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan, in addition to abolishing the Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year, has approved the Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year proposed by the Ministry of Finance, and a report was made at the 16th meeting of the Yuan this month on the 15th. The full text of the measures is excerpted below:

Article 1 These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of Section 1 of the "Supplementary Measures for Financial Consolidation" promulgated by the President on August 26, 37.

Article 2 Public and private profit-seeking enterprises shall calculate their income for the two halves of the 37th year separately and declare their income in the prescribed format to the local competent collection agency before the end of September and the end of February of the following year.

Article 3 The profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 37th year is divided into two installments. The tax paid in the first half of the 37th year based on the estimated payable profit tax for the 36th year is the first installment tax for the 37th year. The tax levied in the second half of the 37th year based on the profit income of the first half of the year is the second installment tax for the 37th year.

Article 4 The collection of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the two installments of the 37th year shall be in accordance with the following provisions:

(1) If the first installment of tax has not been paid in full according to the estimated payment amount, penalties shall be imposed and it shall be recovered in accordance with the law.

(2) For those who declare within the time limit, the competent collection agency shall assess the tax based on the declared income amount and notify the taxpayer to pay within the time limit.

(3) Those who do not declare their income for the first half of the year within the time limit but do not fall under the provisions of Article 10 of these measures, the competent collection agency shall estimate the amount of tax payable according to the provisions of Article 5 of these measures.

(4) Those who have paid the first installment of tax and paid the estimated tax amount for the second half of the 37th year within the time limit shall be exempt from tax audit and shall be exempt from their tax obligations other than the estimated tax paid for the 36th year's income.

(5) Those who have had their first installment of tax audited, paid supplementary tax, and paid it shall be allowed to offset the supplementary tax portion as the payable tax due for the second half of the 37th year.

(6) Taxpayers who disagree with the estimated tax amount for the first installment of this year and have paid it within the time limit shall apply to the local competent collection agency for tax audit and assessment before the end of September and be refunded or compensated according to the law, but only if they possess complete account books as stipulated in Articles 13 and 14 of the Income Tax Law.

Article 5 The estimation of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the second half of the 37th year shall be based on the principle of determining the tax payable by each unit by establishing standards for different industries. For industries without industry association organizations or commercial firms that have not joined industry associations, the competent collection agency shall classify them into relevant industries according to their business nature.

Each industry and commerce association shall submit a roster of the names, addresses, responsible persons, and estimated sales or operating income for the half-year (banking, trust industries, and companies registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall also report the actual amount of capital) of its members before October 16th, and distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of the business conditions of each taxpayer unit by means of a scoring method, and report it to the local competent collection agency for review. The aforementioned scoring method shall be resolved by the board of directors of each industry association.

If the industry association fails to submit a roster of member scores within the time limit, the competent collection agency may directly or indirectly investigate and estimate it by analogy to the commercial conditions of industries with similar natures.

Article 6 The competent collection agency shall estimate the income amount of taxpayers in the first half of the thirty-seventh year and the tax amount payable for the second half of the thirty-seventh year based on the roster reported by the aforementioned association and collect the following information:

(1) A comparison of the prices of major commodities in each industry based on January 37th as the base period with the multiple increases in the first half of the year.

(2) Import and export data from customs and entry-exit management agencies.

(3) Commercial condition data of various industries compiled by public and private statistical and economic research institutions and credit bureaus.

(4) Production and sales data of various goods subject to commodity tax.

(5) Opinions of scholars, experts, and leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors on general commercial conditions and prices.

Article 7 Each taxpayer shall pay the full amount of tax estimated by the competent collection agency in accordance with the preceding article within half a month of the arrival of the tax payment notice. Those who fail to pay within the time limit shall be punished in accordance with Article 156 of the Income Tax Law.

Article 8 The tax amount estimated by the competent collection agency in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 of these measures shall be regarded as the tax amount payable as investigated and verified in accordance with the Income Tax Law. Taxpayers who disagree with the estimated tax amount shall pay the full amount of tax and, within 20 days after the tax payment deadline, submit a written request to the local competent collection agency for reconsideration. Those who fail to pay the tax in full or fail to apply for reconsideration within the time limit will not be accepted.

Article 9 The levy of profit-seeking enterprise income for the second half of the 37th year of state-run enterprises run by government agencies, profit-seeking enterprises jointly run by the government and the people, and companies that have not joined industry associations shall still be subject to tax audit.

Article 10 For industries whose tax payable cannot be estimated in accordance with Article 6 of these measures, with the approval of the competent collection agency, they may request a sample audit of the accounts of at least 5% of the commercial firms in each industry to serve as a reference for calculating the standard sales amount (income amount), standard sales expense rate (income expense rate), and standard sales net profit rate (net income), and refer to the information in the aforementioned member roster to determine the tax estimation standard.

Article 11 The sample audit of the account books of commercial firms in various industries shall be determined by lottery. The selected units shall bring all their account books and statements to the competent collection agency within the specified time limit to await investigation and tax audit. Those who fail to send their accounts for verification in accordance with the prescribed time shall, in addition to selecting other units for account submission, directly determine the income amount and the tax amount payable by the unit and impose penalties in accordance with the law.

For industries with no account books or incomplete account books that are insufficient for sample audit, the business conditions of the industry in the first half of this year may be used as a reference to the business conditions of industries with similar natures to estimate the various standard ratios for tax calculation.

Profit-seeking enterprises engaged in sideline businesses may refer to the business conditions of the enterprise in the first half of this year and refer to its main business to estimate its tax estimation standard.

Article 12 These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Implementation Period of Measures for Permitting Outbound Transportation of Goods Temporarily Delayed to Prevent the Evasion of Price Fluctuations by Goods from This Port

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] After the publication of the measures for permitting the outbound transportation of goods, prices stirred again yesterday. Seeing the potential for profit, merchants competed to purchase goods, causing gauze and other items to rise to the price limit again. In view of this, Supervisor Jiang, in order to prevent such a situation, instructed the responsible personnel of the Goods Adjustment Committee yesterday morning to temporarily delay the issuance of the measures to various agencies in order to postpone their implementation period. At the same time, the Goods Adjustment Committee, because the prices of goods in other ports are recently higher than those in Shanghai, if the flow of goods is allowed, the existing goods in this city will inevitably use various means to escape in large quantities. Therefore, a meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss the issue of the flow of goods between districts at length.

[Another Dispatch] The Shanghai District's Measures for Inspecting and Prohibiting the Outbound Transportation of Goods, which was previously approved and announced by the Inspection Committee, was given a detailed explanation of the prohibited items listed in Article 3 of the measures by the committee yesterday as follows:

(1) Cotton refers to raw cotton that can be used for weaving; waste cotton is not included.

(2) Cotton cloth does not include hand-woven cloth and other cotton textiles.

(3) Paper does not include cigarette paper, yellow printing paper, superstitious paper, and homemade grass paper.

(4) Soda refers to soap for washing and soda ash for making soap; other types of alkali other than scented soap, medicinal soap, and caustic soda are not included.

(5) Leather refers to raw and tanned leather; leather products are not included.

(6) Rubber refers to raw, old, and waste rubber; rubber products are not included.

### Public Confidence and Active Replenishment Lead to Comprehensive Increase in Cotton Yarn Prices; Cloth Market Remains Stable with Prices Retreating from Peak

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation, because concrete measures have been obtained for yarn exports, public confidence turned excited, and merchants from other ports actively replenished their stocks. Local textile manufacturers and practical manufacturers rushed to purchase, and the trend suddenly became brisk.

There was not much fine yarn available on the market, and all grades were traded at the limit price. The Shuangma yarn factory had 21-count yarn for sale, which was traded at 775 yuan. The 20-count yarn sold very well, and merchants from other ports added to their purchases. All dealers repeatedly traded at the limit price. The asking prices for 16-count and 10-count combed yarn also showed a slight firmness.

It is also learned that the Textile Construction Company continued to offer 20-count Wuzi, Hong Kuixing, and Tiannv yarns, a total of eight types, priced at 707 yuan, with 431 pieces traded.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation, because the implementation of the export measures is pending, brokers were ordered to only sell on behalf of companies with licenses and not to purchase on behalf of others. The chairman of the association advised fellow merchants not to raise prices. Public confidence on the trading floor was therefore stable, and local goods brought in were mutually sold off.

The initial price of Longtou fine cloth fell by 400 yuan. It turned brisk at one point in the middle, but as traders took profits near the close, the price returned to 28.4 yuan at the close, a decrease of 200 yuan from the previous day. The mid-range Wufu fine cloth plunged by 1 yuan, and Laba Tong fell by 900 yuan, but the B-brand Laba Tong alone rose by 1 yuan. In addition, Sijunzi serge and white cloth were also sluggish. A total of 1,300 bolts were traded citywide.

It is also learned that the Textile Construction Company offered 12-pound Longtou B fine cloth, priced at 24.7 yuan, as well as Taoyuan Tu Yuan fine cloth and Sijunzi Zhigong wool and colored quilt covers, a total of fourteen types, but there were very few applicants.

### Yarn Industry Asks China Textile Corporation to Lower Yarn Allocation Prices

Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of various yarn factories and the Yarn Industry Association to discuss issues related to yarn allocation. The Yarn Industry Association made three specific recommendations to China Textile Corporation regarding yarn sales in the future: (1) The current price of 20-count yarn sold by China Textile Corporation is set at 707 yuan, which means that all yarn industry colleagues will lose 25 yuan per piece of yarn, including all donations and expenses. Please reduce the price of allocated yarn appropriately in the future. (2) The supply is too small, especially for those with retail outlets. Because market demand has increased, but the allocation of goods by China Textile Corporation is insufficient, there is a trend of supply not meeting demand. Please increase the number of allocated yarn pieces in the future. (3) China Textile Corporation's own yarn production is too small and should be increased appropriately. China Textile Corporation promised to consider these recommendations.

### Silver Industry Reduces Interest Rates Again

The Silver Money and Trust Industry Association, in compliance with orders, further reduced interest rates again. From September 17th, the daily interest rate on loans was changed to 2.2 yuan per thousand, the daily interest rate on deposits was changed to 700 yuan per thousand, and the daily interest rate among colleagues was changed to 1.6 yuan per thousand.

### First Meeting Held Yesterday

(1) Liu Gongyun, Li Lixia, Dong Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Liu Jingji, and Wang Lanseng were elected as members of the Joint Purchasing Committee, with Liu Gongyun concurrently serving as chairman and Li Lixia concurrently serving as vice chairman.

(4) The cotton purchasing fund is set at 100 million yuan, to be shared equally by the Central Bank and state-owned yarn factories.

### Prices Too High in Production Areas, Export Business Declines

Recently, the export business in this city has once again shown a declining trend, with a significant reduction compared to the beginning of the currency system reform. The reason for this is that the prices of various export goods in the production areas have risen too much, while the prices in Shanghai are stable. For example, tung oil produced in Wanxian, Sichuan, is priced at 74 gold yuan per ton, while the selling price in this city is only 70 yuan per ton. Pig bristles produced in Bengbu, which are 3.5 inches long, are priced at 2,000 yuan per simadan, while the selling price in this city is only 1,400 yuan per simadan. Mao tea produced in Pingshui is priced at 80 yuan per dan, while the price of box tea made from processed Mao tea in Pingshui in Shanghai is only 100 yuan. In fact, the processing fee for Mao tea to make box tea is definitely above 20 yuan. Compared with the prices in the production areas and the market prices in this city, plus the transportation costs, the difference is too great, so exporters are unwilling to purchase goods from the production areas. Currently, what is being exported is the goods stockpiled by the merchants in the past, which will be sold out in a short period of time. Exporters are now extremely hopeful that the authorities can suppress the prices of goods in the production areas, otherwise the prices of export goods in this city will definitely be affected, it is said.

### Money Market Remains Surprisingly Loose, Mid-Autumn Festival Smoothly Navigated

Today is the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. The markets for rice, grains, flour, cotton yarn, cooking oil, soybean cake, and other goods are closed for the day as usual, but the silver money industry and the cotton cloth market remain open as usual. Although yesterday was the day before the festival, the money market remained extremely loose. Banks felt there were too many orders and found it difficult to lend out money. This phenomenon of surprisingly loose money market during the festival season is rare, so industrial and commercial sectors are not feeling any difficulty in dealing with their cash flow and can smoothly spend the festival without any unexpected events. Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus paid out another 1.62 million yuan, including 200,000 yuan from the Central Bank, 680,000 yuan from the Bank of China, 230,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, 720,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank, 50,000 yuan from the China Trust Bureau, 270,000 yuan from the Postal Savings Bureau, and 270,000 yuan from the Cooperative Treasury, it is said.

### New Shipment of Red Tea Arrives in Shanghai

Domestic sales of red and green tea remained undiminished yesterday, but the market atmosphere continued to fluctuate due to the guaranteed supply. As for the foreign tea market, it continued to trend slightly upwards, mainly because holders of goods felt that the demand from exporters was strong and the market inventory was extremely low. Therefore, the attitude was healthy and stable, and the asking prices remained at a high point.

It is learned that the first batch of several hundred boxes of red tea made by the Qimen Jiangjunqiao Cooperative this year arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is being sold by the Taishi Anhui Tea Company. It is reported that British merchants Jardine Matheson and Ewo have already inspected the goods. It is said that they are still satisfied with the goods, and they are currently planning to approach the seller for negotiations. It is expected that a formal transaction can be obtained after the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival.

### Rice Market Slightly Firm, New Flour Prices Approved by the Social Affairs Bureau

The rice market saw a slight rise, due to strong quotations from Wuxi, and the rise of various goods outside the industry in recent days, public confidence was solidified, coupled with the meager arrivals and the daily depletion of market stocks, the market trend was thereby firm. The increase in Japonica rice was greater, with high-grade goods rising by 10-200 yuan, and medium and inferior goods rising by 200-300 yuan. Special Japonica rice in the North Market was 22.4 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan. Newly arrived Indica rice was strong, and newly-harvested Du Indica rice fell by 200 yuan instead, while milled Indica rice remained flat. New Japonica rice in the North Market also fell by 200 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals were 823 stones in the South Market and 1,031 stones in the North Market.

Flour: prices rose, with scarce stocks of old-milled flour already reaching the old limit of 7.57 yuan. Other flours were also not far from the limit price.

Grains: mixed, soybean due to the patronage of oil factories, the market situation suddenly changed, and Zha beans and car beans successively reached the limit price, an increase of 500-600 yuan. Corn was bought by the North Merchants and rose by 500-600 yuan. Red sorghum strengthened by 100 yuan, and Du beans saw a slight decline instead.

Cooking oil: prices increased. Due to the increase in prices of goods outside the industry, public confidence was quite solid, and holders of goods were strong. Soybean oil from Datong and other factories opened at 48.6 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan. Rapeseed oil increased by 2.3 yuan, raw oil strongly rose by 3 yuan, clean raw oil was 59 yuan, and small car sesame oil saw an even greater increase, rising by 4 yuan to reach the limit price. Cooked rapeseed oil rose by 3.5 yuan.

It is also learned that since the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs were promulgated, regarding how to convert the gold yuan number of flour prices on August 19th in this city, the results of the Social Affairs Bureau's investigation and report have been submitted. In order to match the factory prices with the retail prices and benefit production and sales, the Social Affairs Bureau convened the Flour Industry Association and market leaders and agreed on the highest standards for factory prices and retail prices within the "August 19" flour price standard as follows: (1) Quality: Based on the No. 2 flour of each brand as the standard; (2) Factory price: The maximum should not exceed 7.62 yuan per bag; (3) Retail price: The maximum should not exceed 7.8 yuan per bag; (4) Market price: The maximum should not exceed the highest standard of the retail price, and at least the necessary expenses of retailers should be deducted.

### Economic Briefs

The China Trust Bureau tendered a large batch of Japanese woolens on Tuesday. The results of the tender opening yesterday showed that over 70 lots were opened, with a value of over 500,000 gold yuan.

The Social Affairs Bureau has now approved the industrial and commercial registration fund as 500 yuan for store funds and 2,000 yuan for company funds.

The Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee has been ordered to be formally abolished on the 25th of this month. From the 15th, the winding-up matters have been handled. The new organization is jointly organized by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Assets Committee and is named the Coal Adjustment and Supply Office, which is currently actively preparing and is scheduled to be established on October 1st. It is rumored that it will still be working in the original location of the Fuel Management Committee.

### False Reporting of Foreign Exchange by Banks; Decision to Revoke Licenses According to Law

[Our Report] After the Financial Minister Hsu Pai-yuan came to Shanghai to supervise the transfer of foreign exchange matters by commercial banks in the city, the registration work has been completed, and the transfer work is also actively underway. However, the foreign exchange figures reported by the various banks, with the exception of the reputable large banks, are mostly inaccurate. Therefore, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau has instructed the Bankers Association to notify its members to make additional corrections, with a deadline of the 30th of this month. Those who fail to report by the deadline or who deliberately provide false information will have their licenses revoked according to law. The original telegram from the Executive Yuan is recorded as follows:

According to Article 5 of the Regulations for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Stored Abroad by the People of the Republic of China, all citizens of the Republic of China, except those whose habitual residence is abroad and are considered overseas Chinese, shall, by December 31, 1948, register and declare their foreign exchange assets stored abroad up to August 20, 1948, to the Central Bank or its entrusted banks, in accordance with the prescribed forms. Foreign exchange assets acquired after August 21, 1948, must be declared and registered within two months from the date of acquisition. Considering the need for early registration of foreign exchange assets held abroad by domestic banks and money houses, it is hereby stipulated that the declaration and registration of their foreign exchange assets held abroad by banks and money houses must be completed by September 30, 1948. Those who fail to declare or provide false information will be deemed to have violated economic control laws, and their business licenses will be revoked or they will be suspended from business upon verification. Those who violate Article 8 of the same regulations by transferring foreign exchange assets to any natural person, legal person, or other organization abroad with the intention of avoiding declaration and registration from August 20, 1948, will be severely punished in accordance with Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing National Mobilization Law, as stipulated in Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the same regulations, once verified.

### Revision of Elementary School Curriculum Standards: Only Objectives and Outlines Listed for Each Subject; Simplified Content with Flexibility for Local Adaptation

[Our Report from Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Education's revised elementary school curriculum standards have now been approved and promulgated. It is reported that the revisions aim for simplification, with each subject only listing objectives and outlines. Implementation measures, revision process, and key teaching points for each subject will be detailed in a separate "Interpretation of Elementary School Curriculum Standards".

The revisions have the following characteristics: (1) Recognizing that the curriculum standard is different from the curriculum itself. The curriculum is the school's course progress, while the curriculum standard is the standard for the curriculum. In other words, it is the standard for measuring the curriculum, not the curriculum itself. Therefore, the revisions are abstract and concise, with flexibility so that each region can create its own appropriate curriculum based on the standards and apply them accordingly. It also has permanence and can be implemented for many years without the need for modification to avoid constant changes. (2) Reduce weekly teaching time for each grade as much as possible to ease the burden on children. Extracurricular group activities will also be included in the timetable to ensure schools pay attention to such activities. (3) Restore civic training. The elementary school curriculum standards revised in 1932 not only taught civic knowledge in elementary common sense and advanced social studies subjects, but also established civic training with set training standards to guide children in practice. The curriculum standards revised in 1942 divided these training standards into two types: moral education standards and hygiene training standards. Now, they are combined into one, and regulations that are difficult for children to understand are all removed. (4) Stipulate that separate textbooks can still be compiled for Chinese and common sense for subject-based teaching. Common sense in the first and second grades does not use textbooks; teachers educate based on separately compiled teaching methods. (5) Stipulate that arithmetic will be formally taught from the third grade. The first and second grades will switch to incidental teaching, and no specific teaching time is specified in "Subjects and Time". (6) Restore the art subject, merging drawing into the art subject to expand the scope and pay attention to aesthetic cultivation, rather than just focusing on drawing techniques. (7) The music and physical education subjects in the first and second grades will still be combined into the "Singing Games" subject, and the manual labor and art subjects will still be combined into the "Manual Labor" subject to strengthen joint teaching and adapt to the level of young children.

### Peicheng School Overcharges; Education Bureau Strictly Orders Refund Within Deadline

[Our Report] The fee standards for public and private primary and secondary schools in the city were previously determined by Mayor Wu and Education Bureau Director Li after convening a symposium with various education groups. For private schools, the fees were set at: primary school, Gold Yuan 20-30; junior high school, Gold Yuan 35-50; senior high school, Gold Yuan 45-60. To thoroughly implement this decision, the Education Bureau has issued a notice to all schools in the city to strictly comply and dispatched personnel to various schools for investigation to prevent any cases of outward compliance but inward disobedience. It has now come to light that the private Peicheng Girls' Primary and Secondary School on Xikang Road has violated the prescribed standards.

### Ye Guanxiong and Wang Wenzheng Struggle; Stalemate After Four Sets; Fifth Set to Continue Today at 5 PM

[Our Report] Table tennis champion Ye Guanxiong encountered a formidable opponent in the semi-finals of the open senior singles yesterday. He battled Wang Wenzheng for two hours, with each winning two sets, resulting in a stalemate. Due to darkness, the final set was postponed to 5 PM today at the Youth Tennis Club. Spectators holding yesterday's ticket stubs do not need to purchase new tickets. A semi-final match in the intermediate singles category was also held before yesterday's match, with the following results:

Intermediate Singles Semi-Final

Senior Singles Semi-Final

Yesterday's score was unexpected to most spectators. Ye Guanxiong found himself in a difficult battle, while veteran Wang Wenzheng was not old, and his unexpected great shots appeared frequently. Ye won the first set too easily, and was careless in the second set, and unable to recover. In the third set, Ye also showed signs of fatigue, and Wang Wenzheng seized the opportunity to progress, which was the key to yesterday's victory or defeat. In terms of the situation, it was evenly matched.

In the first set, Ye Guanxiong's ingenious drop shots and accurate diagonal long shots made Wang Wenzheng exhausted and at a loss. After 0-2, Ye won the next six games. He did not exert his full strength in the second set, performing loosely. Wang Wenzheng tied the score with 6-4. The third set was one of Wang Wenzheng's most brilliant performances in recent years. His fierce forehand shots made Ye Guanxiong's net play and short balls ineffective. Amidst the thunderous cheers of the audience, he defeated his struggling opponent with 7-5 after tying four times. The fourth set was the only lifeline for Ye Guanxiong, so he made a desperate effort. Wang Wenzheng, on the other hand, was already exhausted due to his excessive fatness, and his clothes were soaked. Ye Guanxiong swept away the remaining obstacles and tied the game.

### National Martial Arts Competition Opens Tonight

### World Games Football Team Has Done Its Best; Rong Qizhao Reported on the Process Before and After the Trip Yesterday

[Our Report] Dr. Rong Qizhao, leader of the Chinese World Games football team, hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday at 4:00 PM, giving a very detailed report on the team's trip to England. Excerpts are as follows:

(1) The football team received a warm welcome and hospitality from overseas Chinese and our embassies along the way. The original schedule of 25 matches was increased by 10 to a total of 35 matches, with 25 wins, 5 losses, and 5 draws. After arriving in England, they won a friendly match against the United States and lost to Turkey in the World Games. On the way back home, they won all five matches.

(2) The football team's organization was simple and democratic, with only Rong himself serving as the leader and Li Huitang as the coach. A five-member executive committee was also established to handle the team's affairs, consisting of Rong, Li, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, and Zhang Banglun. Yan Shixin and Ye Qingrong were appointed as accountants to keep the books open to the public.

(3) The football team had not a penny to its name when it set off. The National Sports Association did not provide any subsidies. Rong borrowed 60,000 Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Football Association donated 16,000 yuan, and the Hong Kong ball game earned 14,000 yuan, totaling 90,000 Hong Kong dollars. After paying for air tickets, only a few thousand yuan were left. The tour game earned a total of 267,000 yuan. In Calcutta, paid for the board and lodging of the delegation and the travel expenses of the basketball team, and brought the track and field representatives back, which resulted in owing the plane ticket money to Tongjilong when leaving England. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there were still more than 20,000 yuan borrowed in Hong Kong that could not be repaid. The football team itself was not in debt, but the delegation was in debt. It was originally planned to go to the Philippines to raise money to pay off debts when returning home, but the team could not make the trip due to the rainy season in Manila. It can be said that the football team has done its best for the entire delegation.

(4) Hao Gengsheng's donation in Nanyang only accounted for more than 400 pounds. The delegation in London had to spend more than 120 pounds a day. Team members had no pocket money, and travel expenses ran out. The head coach and his wife even lived in expensive hotels. When the delegation arrived in Calcutta, there were only more than 30 pounds left, which shows how embarrassing the situation was.

(5) Impressions of participating in the World Games football: European football has progressed rapidly, and their physical strength and endurance are amazing. They can kick for one or two hours without reducing speed, and they don't care at all. Our country's defeat was due to insufficient endurance and physical strength. They were not used to playing in the rain, and the more they kicked in the rain, the heavier they became, and the heavier they became, the less they could move. European countries all employ British professional coaches, and the results are impressive. What the football team can be gratified about is that the whole team is harmonious and cooperative, and their spirit is excellent.

### Tiewu Cup Small Ball to Open Tomorrow at Zhenru

The first Tiewu Cup Small Ball League, organized by the Zhenru District Righteous Police Brigade, and the Shuping Cup Charity Match, with a total of 26 participating teams, divided into five groups, will open tomorrow at the Zhenru Central National School playground. At that time, the organizer, Liu Jian, will invite Dr. Yu Xiuhao, Director of Education of the Shanghai Municipal Police School, to preside over the opening ceremony. The list of each group and the opening order are recorded below:

Group 1) Yongfu, Zhenru, Yili, Fendou, Ye Qing, (Group 2) Zhendi, Putuo, Nanhe, Zhongying, Qingguang, (Group 3) Ji Yi, Yongding, Yi Zhong, Yingqing, Damingxin, (Group 4) Sizhi, Feihu, Xihua, Beixin, Zhizhong, (Group 5) Ma Yi, Joint Team, Chongxin, Jiufeng, Jianzhong, Zhong Yi.

### On Female Favorites

-- Ji Yong

There has always been a saying: "Even heroes have a hard time getting past the beauties." Or, elegantly: "Heroes are short of breath, but full of love for their children." This shortcoming, developed from the primitive instincts of mankind - the so-called "food and sex, the greatest desires of man" - is really impossible to control, and perhaps this is why it can be forgiven.

"Three thousand beauties in the harem" is certainly inhumane and barbaric; but it does not hinder the "king's affairs." What is to be feared is that "three thousand favors are concentrated on one person," which is sure to be terrible. Although ancient history is not entirely reliable, the facts of ancient history are inevitably the result of later generations tracing cats and drawing tigers. For example, the fall of Jie of Xia and Zhou of Shang is almost the same. Jie had Meixi, and Zhou had Daji, both of whom were fox spirits. Although the storytellers were not clever and childish, they can just explain that what men like most is women, and what they fear most is also women. In the Bible, Eve swallowed Satan's apple, and sin also originated with women.

Of course, these statements are all "nonsense" from a male-centered society, and should be protested by revolutionary female comrades. However, in fact, although men rule the world, their purpose is nothing more than to please women or to hunt for more women, and even to hunt for women who cannot be pursued. Cleopatra brought Caesar the Great to his knees. A world-renowned hero was ultimately no match for a smile, which is really strange! Then, although women in the past did not fully occupy human fame and wealth like Wu Zetian, but they had substance without name, and it is not necessary to be too frustrated to explore and obtain the pearl.

It is true that women are turned into playthings for men, but that is vulgar women, just as vulgar men are destined to be subservient to the superior intellect. Mencius said that when the world is without Tao, the small is subservient to the large, and the weak is subservient to the strong. In fact, it is not enough. Originally, whether the world has Tao or not, the foolish are always subservient to the wise, which is undeniable. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also acknowledged this principle in his Doctrine of People's Rights. All human beings are like this, and women are no exception, except that women are enslaved at home and men are enslaved in society. However, the women who are generally intelligent can all play with their husbands on the palm of their hands, and make men unaware of it. This kind of magic power is beyond the reach of others. Ma Jiepu and Hengniang in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio are two stereotypes. Although Ma Jiepu's wife is fierce, she is not Hengniang's opponent. Only like Hengniang can she be gentle and overcome the strong, and manage the men to be docile.

Therefore, both the family and the country are like battlefields. Men and women are seemingly affectionate, but in essence they are fighting. Not only that, but women wage "civil wars" with women, and men wage "civil wars" with men. As Westerners say, "There is still life in the battlefield, and a murderous intent arises in the emotional battlefield," which is quite understanding. Just look at the secrets of the palace since the Han and Tang Dynasties, and the number of horizontal peach cases everywhere, which is really scary. Formal wars can be avoided, but only this kind of war cannot be avoided. No matter how reformed, it is always difficult to seek rationality. Mrs. Dorothy Parker of the United States wrote in her poem: "Women want monogamy, but men prefer novelty. Love is the sun and moon for women, and men have different colors. Women spend their lives with their husbands, and men get headaches after counting ten times down. All in all, if this is the case, what good things will there be in the world!" (Should be written in separate lines) This is just a woman's words, infatuated women and heartless men, in a word; as for men, why can't they do the opposite? How few heartless women are there in the world?

This is not important, but it may cause trouble. King You and Baosi were engaged in a war of nerves, but a beacon fire came to play with the lords, and the careers of both civil and military affairs were lost. What a "look that can bring down a city, a look again that can bring down a country." It is rare for a muddleheaded man to embrace the heart of "a beautiful woman is hard to find again," so the city and the country are really unreliable. Therefore, some people shouted, "The words of concubines and women must not be listened to." It is probably someone who has suffered. Don't say it's a bad thing, even a good thing can be messed up, because men often think that the person next to their pillow is the most trustworthy. While listening to Curtain Lecture, they also blow their own secrets. The Empress Dowager wanted to dismiss the corrupt Prince Qing and told the Grand Councilor Qu Ziju. However, Qu told his virtuous wife, and the wife revealed it to the British Minister's wife when she entertained foreign guests, and she instructed the minister in the Curtain. So the London Times published it in a special way, making the Empress Dowager want to investigate this anonymous person who leaked the secret. As a result, Grand Councilor Qu was dismissed from his post, and all plans were dashed. It only makes later generations sigh. Please think, how can the grand plan of reform be told to women, let alone women who want to show off in the Yi Suo? I have infinite regret for Secretary Tao, so I wrote the article on female favorites.

### Going Upstairs

-- Liu An

Among the human race, which is still in the process of evolution, the activity that consumes the most energy is climbing stairs. For example, in terms of the calories needed for various exercises, in the same period of time, climbing a staircase requires 158 percent more calories than sawing wood, 110 percent more than running; it is even more strenuous than swimming, requiring 86 percent more calories. (Translated from Collier's Weekly)

### Salary Respect

— You Mojun

School has already started, and we brothers who wipe blackboards and inhale chalk dust are about to start the show again with renewed vigor. Upon receiving the employment letter, the first thing to check is the number of teaching hours per week. Then, we must clearly see the amount of salary that we depend on for our livelihood in order to feel settled.

The price that teachers earn through their mental labor is called salary. Although this term has been used for a long time, it is somewhat frowned upon by senior teachers when discussed over tea and wine. In the era when private tutoring was prevalent, the respect that students paid to their tutors was called "study money," which is not significantly different in meaning from what is now called tuition. However, it was different for families who hired tutors in their private residences; study money was called either "house grain" or "bundle of dried meat." The former, plainly speaking, was just tuition calculated in rice; but with "house" attached to "grain," it clearly seemed like a very generous, refined, and respectful term, making both the giver and the receiver feel guiltless. The latter is based on the words of Confucius, "Of my own accord, I have never refused instruction to anyone who came to me with a bundle of dried meat." According to ancient annotations, a bundle of dried meat was "ten strips of dried meat." Stretching it means *ting*, bending it means *qu*. So ten strips of dried meat, in today's language, is about the same as "ten hams." Offering ten hams to Confucius was the most respectful thing to do, no wonder Confucius was willing to "patiently guide" them. With the advent of foreign currency, the bundle of dried meat was sometimes changed to "repair sheep." Great pains were taken to avoid using the word "foreign," because Confucius could not be bought with foreign money! Some even changed it to "repair gold," which already had a hint of money-grubbing. "Salary" had never been heard of.

In the early Republic, what was given to teachers in schools was called "repair gold"; if one held a concurrent position, the income from that position was called "salary." The employment letter clearly distinguished between the two, without mixing them up. Zhejiang was like that. A friend once got very angry because the repair gold on his employment letter was mistakenly written as salary; looking back now, he was too stubborn; since they're not asking you to buy ham, then buying some "firewood," which the family can use, is also acceptable!

Since the term "public education personnel" was established, the word "education" has been relegated to a subordinate position under the word "public." The price that civil servants receive for their monthly service is naturally called "salary," because they must be honest and self-disciplined, so in name, it seems they cannot eat ham every day! In this way, teachers, who in name could eat some ham to replenish their nutrition, also had their "repair gold" changed to "salary." Confucius, "the sage who is in tune with the times," I think if he were alive today, he would probably agree and say, "The bundle of dried meat is propriety; now it's changed to 'salary,' I follow the majority," right?

Some people say that teachers are hired, and their salaries should be different from the salaries of civil servants who are appointed. We could follow the example of the Qing Dynasty officials giving "charcoal respect" to poor scholars at the end of the year, and change it to "salary respect." I think this is a bit too pedantic. What do "colleagues" think?

### The Tomb of Fragrant Concubine

— Yi Yun

Reading the 12th's newspaper, it stated that the round-domed tomb of Fragrant Concubine, located in the eastern suburbs of Kashi, southern Xinjiang, suddenly collapsed on August 2nd, and that this tomb was a famous historical site in southern Xinjiang, and will be from now on missing from view, etc. Those familiar with the story of Fragrant Concubine are numerous, but those who have not set foot in Xinjiang may not know the location of her burial. I will briefly describe it to inform the readers.

According to records, there is a Fragrant Concubine Temple located about four or five miles outside of Kashi, Xinjiang. The temple is square in shape with a round top, hollow and spacious. The tiles are green and blue in color, and the structure is very magnificent. There are no idols in the temple, only the tomb of Fragrant Concubine, which is the burial place of the concubine who was known for her beauty and integrity during the mid-Qing Dynasty (Qianlong era). The concubine was from a Uyghur noble family, the daughter of Ajimu Shaqun Hejia and the sister of Duke Tu. She was born in Hami. At the age of five, she moved with her father to Turpan. At the age of nine, she moved to Kashi. At the age of twenty, she married Da Hezhuomu. She had a unique fragrance on her body and unparalleled beauty. Her fame spread far and wide, eventually reaching the ears of the Qing Emperor Qianlong. He launched a military expedition, pacified southern Xinjiang, killed Da Hezhuomu, and captured the concubine, who was twenty-two years old at the time. The concubine was of strong character and integrity. Not only did she refuse to submit, but she also secretly hid sharp weapons, wanting to see her enemy and be satisfied. Although the Qing Emperor tried to appease her in many ways and built a "Uyghur Camp" in Beijing that was furnished just like Kashi, hoping to win her favor, it was to no avail for ten years. This reached the ears of the Empress Dowager, who, fearing that she would harm the Emperor, poisoned the concubine, or some say she was strangled. She died at the age of thirty-eight. Her sister-in-law was also captured and stayed with the concubine in Beijing. After the concubine's death, her brother died of grief and indignation. The sister-in-law then loaded the remains of the concubine and her brother onto camel carts, traveled through several large deserts, and transported them back to Kashi, where she built a tomb and temple. The loyal bones returned to their homeland after ten thousand miles. This is the Fragrant Concubine Temple mentioned above. The Uyghurs, grateful for the concubine's integrity, flocked to worship her in an endless stream. Over time, a bazaar gradually formed in front of the temple (bazaar in Uyghur). Even women seeking children or marriage, as well as those with marital discord, all went to pray, treating her as a deity. I recall that more than twenty years ago, Qianlong's mausoleum was excavated and then flooded. The bones of men and women were mixed and indistinguishable (because his many concubines were buried in the same mausoleum). Those who collected the bones had no choice but to hire an old undertaker who used to be in charge of examining corpses to sort and collect them, and then hastily bury them. If Fragrant Concubine had lost her integrity at the time, wouldn't she have been buried with the other concubines, and similarly been dug up by thieves, her bones exposed and flooded? How could there be today's tomb and temple, adding color to southern Xinjiang, and the Uyghurs offering incense and flowers to worship her as a deity? Thirty miles south of Guihua City in Suiyuan, there is the Green Tomb of Ming Concubine (i.e., the tomb of Wang Zhaojun of the Han Dynasty). Her beauty has been passed down for thousands of years. This tomb of Fragrant Concubine can be compared to it. However, Fragrant Concubine was able to return her bones to her hometown, while Ming Concubine is forever buried in a foreign land. This is the fortune of Fragrant Concubine.

### Recent Poems from the Art Gallery

— Shi Shufan

Mr. Yuan Chu returned to his hometown via Shanghai, accompanied by Mr. Xueni to inquire,

and then invited Sanmu Kongwo Bai Jiao for a drink at the Art Gallery. At the

gathering, they talked about the Famous Figures of the Guangxu and Xuantong Eras, as well as the facts about the elders

such as Xiang Qi, Sanyuan, and Taiyi. Before parting, they agreed to meet on the night of the full moon at West Lake.

Returning east, my sleeves carry the water chestnut, temporarily leaving Qingxi to visit the crazy Chu. The trees in the courtyard still flow with January dreams, the wine vessels have been desolate for nearly half a year. It is difficult to resist the vulgarity of hiding in seclusion, and it is more than just regretting the loss of poetry. We look forward to meeting under the wind and dew tonight, to watch the tide and step on the moon to Qiantang.

Getting off the carriage, I rejoice at the feeling of the Art Gallery, and the post road is desolate, hiding my name. The fleeting time of illness makes spring and summer short, and the flavor of a cold official is rice, salt, and clear. The water of Songjiang is beautiful, and righteousness is initially purple, the sea market in autumn is high, and the moon gradually brightens. I love the deeds of the Guangxu and Xuantong predecessors, truly able to summarize a lifetime in a few words.

Lu Yanshao left behind a very beautiful Fortune Celebration Pear. I happened to read Mr. Feng Chaoran's short article about you, so I expanded on its meaning.

Building a secluded residence with thatch and bamboo, twenty acres of fragrant Hangzhou and one hundred acres of pear. I have already checked my hemp shoes and entered Shu in vain, and now I lie down in Wukang.

The main street is newly named Lu Family Rare, the branches are burdened with emerald green, not worried about poverty. The earth's energy naturally follows the noble person, as pure as ink and as flavorful as a person.
