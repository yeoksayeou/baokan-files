### Recovering Haicheng in Southern Liaoning with a Surprise Attack; Yingkou Already Under National Army Control

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch] Haicheng, an important military town and grain-producing area in southern Liaoning, was recovered by Liu Yuzhang's troops from the surprise attack corps advancing south from Shenyang at 9:30 AM on the 23rd. With Haicheng captured, Dashiqiao and Yingkou are as good as in the hands of the National Army, and their capture is imminent. Liu's troops advanced south from south of Anshan on the night of the 22nd, completed the encirclement of Haicheng on the morning of the 23rd, and captured it in one fell swoop. Approximately two regiments of the bandit Changjiang's forces, except for those killed or wounded, mostly fled towards Ximu City, Tasha Pu, 25 kilometers northeast of Haicheng. After recovering Haicheng, Liu's troops have pointed south towards Dashiqiao. Once Dashiqiao falls, Yingkou can be taken without a fight. It is reported that the naval fleet has already sailed to the overseas waters of Yingkou and will cooperate with the southward advancing corps to land in Yingkou and engage in a pincer attack. Haicheng is a grain-producing area with a bumper harvest this autumn. It will greatly help the grain shortage in Shenyang. The grain price in Shenyang has been falling for days, which is largely due to the success of the Mayor's grain storage campaign and the recovery of Zhangwu and Haicheng.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch] A decisive battle is brewing in western Liaoning, and both sides are intensifying their deployments. The bandits in Jinzhou continue to move towards the Jinxi area. The bandit independent divisions 4, 6, and 8 have recently moved from west of Jinxi, passing through Haicheng and heading towards Suizhong, their intentions unclear. There have only been constant small-scale contacts in the Jinxi area. The Shenyang westward advancing corps has not actively attacked, and the bandits gathered in Heishan have already retreated, knowing that they are facing difficulties.

[Another Telegram] About three or four independent divisions of bandits from Changchun are moving south from Shuangyang. Currently, there are about three or four independent divisions of bandits in Changchun.

### Bitterly Defending Changchun, Running Out of Food and Ammunition; Zheng Dongguo Sacrifices Heroically; All 300 Officers and Soldiers Under His Command Perish

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch] It is reported that General Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters and concurrently Chairman of Jilin Province, who was defending Changchun alone, led his troops to firmly defend the core stronghold, the Central Bank Building, and fought bravely with the bandits since the start of the battle in the city. As ammunition and food ran out, he finally fired the last bullet on the morning of the 21st and sacrificed heroically. All 300 officers and soldiers under his command also perished. Zheng sent a telegram to his wife, Ms. Chen Zelian, on the 18th, saying, "Take care of yourself, farewell forever!" On the 20th, he sent a telegram to Du Yuming, Zhao Jiaxiang, and other friends, saying, "Although the overall situation is lost, we will fight to the end to preserve the loyalty and integrity of our revolutionary soldiers. I hope you will be relieved."

### Brief Biography of General Zheng

General Zheng Dongguo was from Shimen, Hunan, and was 46 years old. He graduated from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy in 1924. In the spring of 1925, in the Battle of Danshui, as a company instructor, he participated in the Dare-to-Die Corps and was the first to enter the city. In March, he was promoted to the Training Regiment as a party representative. In December, he served as a major battalion commander of the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division. In the Northern Expedition and bandit suppression campaigns, he always took the lead. In 1932, he successively served as the commander of the independent brigade of the 2nd Division and the 4th and 5th Brigades. The following year, in the Battle of Gubeikou, he led his troops north from Luoyang and repeatedly achieved great feats. In 1936, he was promoted to commander of the 2nd Division and concurrently commander of the Tongguan Garrison. When the War of Resistance broke out, the General led his division to defend against the enemy. In 1938, he participated in the Battle of Taierzhuang. The following year, he was transferred to the deputy commander of the 95th Army, and then was appointed as the commander of the Honorary 1st Division and concurrently the deputy commander of the 5th Army. He participated in the Battle of Kunlun Pass with General Du Yuming. On the first day, he occupied the major strongholds on the periphery of the Japanese invaders. Subsequently, with enemy aircraft assisting in the battle, he fought fiercely for over ten days. The General, with the determination to win, seized the opportunity and launched a sudden advance towards the enemy. Kunlun Pass was then captured by us, and the Japanese 5th Division was crushed as a result. Military experts around the world gained a deep impression of the bravery of our national army. In 1940, he was transferred to the commander of the New 11th Army, which was later changed to the 8th Army, guarding Jiangnan, preventing the enemy from daring to cross the Lei River. Each inspection and review by the war zone headquarters resulted in the General's troops being ranked first. In 1943, he was appointed as the commander of the New 1st Army of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India. He worked hard to build up the army in India. At the end of October, he led the 38th and New 22nd Divisions, as well as the newly formed 30th Division, along with the 14th and 50th Divisions, and various directly subordinate artillery and tank units to launch a counterattack, successively capturing Jebushan and Myitkyina, and repeatedly defeating the stubborn enemy. The ugly captives lost their courage, and the situation in the Yunnan-Burma theater changed as a result. Later, the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India was expanded into the New 1st and New 6th Armies, and the General was promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India, assisting General Stilwell in opening up the China-India-Burma international route. From the counterattack in northern Burma in October 1943 to March 1945, he successively used tens of thousands of troops against an enemy force of 120,000, killing more than 30,000, wounding more than 70,000, and capturing more than 300, and obtaining many light and heavy weapons, creating brilliant military achievements. In January 1945, the National Government awarded him the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. In February, he was promoted to lieutenant general. In May, he represented the party members of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma to attend the Sixth National Congress and was elected as an alternate member of the Sixth Central Executive Committee, and also attended the First Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee. Soon after the task of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India was completed, the General led his troops in triumph and was reassigned as the Deputy Commander of the Third Front Army. In September, he flew to Nanjing and Shanghai to handle the reception of newly formed underground troops. In the spring of 1946, he was transferred to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Headquarters and also acted as the Commander-in-Chief, leading his troops from Jinzhou to advance on Shenyang, and then supervising the troops in Siping Street, directly attacking Changchun and Jilin, reaching the south bank of the Songhua River. In September, he supervised the troops in Rehe and assisted the military affairs in eastern Hebei and southern Chahar. In November, he supervised the troops in eastern Liaoning again, recovering Andong and Tonghua. In the spring of 1947, the Communist army launched a large-scale offensive in the Northeast. The General then led his troops to relieve the siege of Siping, saving the situation in the Northeast. In September, he was appointed Deputy Director of the Northeast Xing Yuan (Headquarters), assisting in military and political affairs in the Northeast. On February 1, 1948, after the establishment of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the General served as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief and concurrently Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, stationed in Changchun, shielding southern Songliao, and then concurrently served as the Commander of the Changchun Garrison. The General was handsome and refined, amiable and dignified, proficient in military strategy, skilled in literature, and had the demeanor of a Confucian general. Many of his staff were also talented young people. The General was frugal and self-disciplined throughout his life, with no savings. He left behind two sons and one daughter.

### Legislative Yuan Discusses the Current Situation; Committees Hope the Government Will Thoroughly Reform; Stabilize Prices and Safeguard International Peace

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan held a meeting to discuss the current situation at 9 AM on the 23rd. More than 200 members attended. Rao Fenghuang was elected as chairman. First, the proposer, Hu Qiuyuan, reported his personal opinions. Those who continued to speak included Du Xunruo, Lei Yin, Miao Qiping, Liu Shengbing, Bao Huaguo, Huang Jianzhong, Wang Zemin, Shen Chongyu, Zhan Qinghui, Huang Xiren, Dong Zhengzhi, Zhou Jieren, and Lu Fu, etc. Yang Jiying and others also submitted written opinions. All expressed their concern for the current situation. Finally, the original proposer was asked to summarize the opinions expressed by the various members and draw a conclusion. The opinions of all speakers unanimously believed that the Communist bandits used international forces to control the Northeast, causing China to enter a new period of national crisis. This is not a matter of temporary military success or failure of the government. If it is not handled well afterwards, it will affect the survival of the entire nation. The fact that the Northeast is not in the hands of the legitimate government of China not only threatens the survival of the entire nation but has also endangered world peace. The speakers criticized the government's administration but also believed that if this government cannot be consolidated, the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction will follow. Therefore,

In the political aspect, it is hoped that the government can thoroughly reform and strengthen itself with the greatest determination, especially by being truly responsible and fulfilling the reality of a responsible cabinet, knowing when to advance and retreat. From the central government to the local level, new people must be used, new policies must be implemented, and corrupt and mediocre people must be eliminated, and people with both integrity and ability should be appointed. The National Army on the front lines should not fail in its duties, promote cooperation between the military and the people, and the government must have fair rewards and punishments, especially by truly reforming local politics, training new troops, and appointing capable and upright people to organize local armed forces to protect their hometowns.

In the economic aspect, it is hoped that the government will make good use of all its foreign exchange to purchase daily necessities for the people and stabilize prices and promote production in a reasonable and effective manner, especially by using great determination to sanction powerful families.

In the diplomatic aspect, the speakers all reiterated the Chinese people's determination to support international peace and also hoped that friendly countries would respect their treaty obligations, understand the situation in the Northeast, and provide China with necessary cooperation in relation to the safety and security of the world. At the same time, it is hoped that the government will adjust diplomatic relations with various countries and promote cooperation based on the Chinese people's love of peace and spirit of resistance against aggression.

All speakers unanimously expressed their determination to resist the Communist bandits and firmly believe that if the government can thoroughly reform and the national will is concentrated, China will be able to overcome its difficulties and rebuild the country's freedom, stability, and glory, and the Legislative Yuan should also use its power to urge the government to make the necessary reforms and live up to the expectations of the people.

(6) The adjustment of treatment includes personnel at the central, provincial, and municipal levels. As for the treatment of county-level personnel, it will be handled quickly in accordance with the above-mentioned principles.

### Zhu Jiahua to Broadcast This Afternoon: The Road to Maintaining Peace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Zhu Jiahua, Honorary President of the World Federation of United Nations Associations and President of the China Association for the United Nations, will broadcast to the people of the world in Chinese and English at 11:30 AM on the first United Nations Day at the Central Broadcasting Station. The title is "The Road to Maintaining Peace," which will briefly state that it has been more than three years since the end of World War II, but the peace treaties with Germany and Japan have not yet been signed. This not only shows that it is easy to win victories on the battlefield but difficult to win peace at the conference table, but also shows that countries also have "those who can share adversity but not prosperity." Now the third General Assembly of the United Nations is being held in Paris. I, on behalf of the China Association for the United Nations, appeal to peace-loving people all over the world that peace is as fragile as a stack of eggs, and only by strengthening the support of the United Nations can peace be maintained.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] A U.S. State Department spokesperson, in response to recent comments in some foreign newspapers that the United States has abandoned aid to President Chiang and plans to use Japan as an advanced base in the Pacific, condemned this statement as lacking common sense, and said: This kind of statement has no basis.

This batch of war supplies is currently being shipped to China.

### Grand Celebration of "United Nations Day"; President to Broadcast Proclamation Today; Foreign Minister Wang Will Also Make a Commemorative Speech

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The 24th is United Nations Day, and the Presidential Office has scheduled a grand celebration ceremony to be held at 10 AM this morning. Three years ago, on this day, the United Nations Charter, which promotes world peace, came into effect. It was subsequently designated as "United Nations Day" by the Second Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly. (Please refer to pages 3 and 4 for news related to United Nations Day)

[United Nations Shanghai Office News] Today (the 24th) is United Nations Day. President Chiang is scheduled to broadcast a proclamation on United Nations Day at 7:30 PM this afternoon. Following that, Madame Chiang will broadcast the achievements of the China Committee of the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund in her capacity as Chairman of the Committee. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang will broadcast the work of the Children's Emergency Fund in China.

[United Press, Success Lake, 23rd Dispatch] The United Nations Secretariat will begin commemorating United Nations Day on the 23rd, reading a telegram from Chinese President Chiang.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] On the eve of United Nations Day, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie broadcast to the country, saying that although the United Nations has suffered various obstacles and setbacks, it is still an organization that encourages world public opinion to save peace. Wang said: Our country's status in the United Nations today is very different from its status in the League of Nations in the past. China was not among the founders of the League of Nations at that time, and the League of Nations did not give our country an appropriate position. Therefore, China is not responsible for the failure of the League of Nations, but the current situation is very different. Our country is one of the founders of the United Nations, and our country is one of the non-permanent members of the Security Council. We have a special and unavoidable responsibility for its success or failure. Today, I want to remind all my compatriots that the main task of this United Nations is to prevent war and guarantee peace. If this task fails, the future of the world is unimaginable. In future wars, all scientific weapons, such as atomic bombs, rocket launchers, and germ warfare gases, will be used. We believe that no one can be considered a righteous victorious nation. Therefore, the task of the United Nations is truly sacred today. Wang said: The past three years of the United Nations cannot be considered satisfactory, which is an undeniable fact, but when the position of the United Nations is about to stabilize, we should pay special attention to it and should not despise it. We should strengthen our trust in the United Nations and should not hesitate. Wang personally wrote the broadcast speech in commemoration of United Nations Day and broadcast it in Mandarin to the country at 5:15 PM Nanjing time on the 23rd.

### A Word to the Citizens of Shanghai

— Chiang Ching-kuo

In the past ten days or so, the general public's sentiment has been unstable due to the influence of market fluctuations. I also acknowledge that the current situation is indeed a significant challenge. On September 12th, I told the citizens of Shanghai that the future of Shanghai's economic controls would not be smooth sailing or a moonlit, gentle breeze, but rather a difficult and arduous task. Now, we are indeed encountering such a juncture, which is something we anticipated.

Everyone, please calmly consider that Shanghai's production volume in the past month, except for a few smaller factories that reduced work due to a lack of raw materials, has generally not decreased, especially the production of daily necessities, with the exception of the flour industry. This year, the harvests in the rural areas of the country have generally been bountiful. Although the increase in the amount of Gold Yuan Certificates issued is sufficient to stimulate price increases, the reserve backing for the Gold Yuan Certificates has also increased. The current unease seems to be mostly due to man-made factors. Since the government ordered the exchange of gold banknotes, the general public has naturally had their purchasing power greatly enhanced because they have exchanged a large amount of Gold Yuan Certificates. For example, taking the business situation of Wing On Company as an example, the sales value on August 17th was 11.879 Gold Yuan Certificates; on August 30th, it increased to 28.015 Gold Yuan Certificates; on September 15th, it increased to 85.745 Gold Yuan Certificates; and on October 10th, it further increased to 111.714 Gold Yuan Certificates. From these figures, it can be seen that the exchange of gold banknotes and the increase in purchasing power are directly related. Has Shanghai's merchandise been sold out now? Absolutely not. Taking Wing On Company as an example again, the total sales in September were 1,542,094 Gold Yuan Certificates, and the number of goods purchased was 1,164,760 Gold Yuan Certificates. The difference between the two numbers is limited, but if the inventory is included, this quantity must exceed the monthly purchase quantity several times. Taking the example of October, on October 8th alone, sales amounted to 82,000 Gold Yuan Certificates, and purchases also reached 72,000 Gold Yuan Certificates. Although the purchase quantity cannot be equal to the sales quantity, if there is inventory from previous years, there will definitely not be any panic. Wing On Company is just one example. In general, merchants are clamoring that goods have been sold out, but in reality, this may be the case for a few stores, but generally speaking, there is no shortage of inventory in various counties and stores. As another example, the amount of yarn allocated to the textile industry last month was the same as the previous month, and the cotton cloth inventory on October 1st was 6.78 million bolts, and on October 20th, the inventory was still 6.58 million bolts. In this way, the production of various cotton textiles will definitely not decrease. Therefore, we can firmly believe that Shanghai does not lack goods for the market, but rather that merchants are anticipating price increases and are unwilling to release their inventory, resulting in the so-called shortage phenomenon today. In the future, we must make them release their goods and supply the market at the limited price. To be honest, the raw materials used for these goods were all advanced before August 19th. The government painstakingly maintains the limited prices of public utilities and daily necessities in order to prevent changes in wages. Since the raw materials and wages are from "August 19th," what reason is there not to sell the goods at the "August 19th" limited price? Taking the current cloth production situation as an example, a bolt of twill cloth, in addition to the allocated yarn price, salaries, wages, electricity costs, and other cost items, can still earn 1.8 Gold Yuan Certificates per bolt if sold at the August 19th limited price. From this point of view, there is no loss-making phenomenon for general manufacturers. Naturally, if all the goods are completely supplied to the market now, there will be panic buying because Shanghai prices are lower than those in other places. However, next month, when every Shanghai citizen obtains a shopping certificate, under the quota purchase system, there will no longer be any need to fear merchants such as so-called "single carriers" snapping up goods. At that time, whether we are wholesalers, retailers, or manufacturers, we will have to take out our inventory. When necessary, a portion of the goods will be purchased by the government and sold to various places in order to exchange for the agricultural raw materials and food needed by Shanghai.

Editorial

### Thoughts on United Nations Day

Today is "United Nations Day," and billions of people in 58 countries around the world are enthusiastically celebrating and praying for peace, expressing humanity's sincere love and care for the United Nations organization. Although everyone understands in their hearts that the foundation of the United Nations is built on the "unanimity of opinions" of the great powers, and whether it can exert its effect of maintaining world peace depends on whether today's great powers can unite and cooperate, in any case, the United Nations has not lost its symbolic significance as "one world," and it is still humanity's only hope for world peace. Although today's world is in the torrent of bipolarization, we are pleased to celebrate the anniversary of the United Nations and still hold infinite hope for the future of the United Nations.

The germination of the United Nations began with the "Declaration of the United Nations" on New Year's Day in 1942. At that time, the Pacific War had not broken out for long, and the German army was advancing deep into Soviet territory, which can be described as the darkest era of mankind. Whether the United Nations had any hope of winning the war was even more bleak. Therefore, the United Nations issued a declaration, on the one hand, publicly announcing the United Nations' war goals, and on the other hand, calling on all countries to fight side by side to the end, and never to make a separate peace with the Axis powers. Since then, the idea of the United Nations has gradually developed. At the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in October 1943, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union issued a "Four-Power Universal Security Declaration," which showed the four powers' determination to guarantee collective security after the war, and can be regarded as the predecessor of the United Nations Charter. Subsequently, the United Nations gradually gained an advantage in military affairs, and it was expected that complete victory was not far away. Representatives of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union met again at Dumbarton Oaks in the United States to draw a "blueprint" for today's United Nations organization. On April 25, 1945, the San Francisco Conference passed the United Nations Charter, and the United Nations organization was born.

Therefore, from the perspective of the United Nations' birth process, it is not difficult to understand the significance of the United Nations. In short, during the war, the United Nations relied on the joint cooperation of all countries to win military victory; after the victory, it also relied on all countries to unite in the same spirit to jointly create world peace. Looking back at the growth of the United Nations in the past seven or eight years, the United Nations has not only won a glorious victory for mankind, but has also laid a solid foundation for world peace. Although the current international situation seems to run counter to the purpose of the United Nations and is moving towards division, in fact, the achievements of the United Nations are indeed rare and valuable. Although the United Nations is currently facing a severe test due to the Berlin issue, human conscience will surely enable the United Nations to safely overcome this difficult obstacle and become a truly effective international organization for maintaining world peace.

Since the United Nations Charter officially came into effect on November 24, 1945, it has held three general assemblies. On balance, the United Nations has indeed eliminated a lot of hatred, disputes, and wars among nations, especially the Security Council, which has had more successes than failures. In fact, the Security Council's successes include the following: (1) The withdrawal of Allied troops stationed in Iran, Syria, and Lebanon, which peacefully resolved the issues of the three countries; (2) The mediation of the "Dutch-Indonesian conflict" in Indonesia, which spared 90 million Indonesians from the ravages of war; (3) The reconciliation of the "India-Pakistan dispute" in India, which spared 400 million people in India and Pakistan from the catastrophe of civil war; (4) The mediation of the "Jewish-Arab War" in Palestine, and the ceasefire order was finally accepted by both sides; (5) For the Greek civil war, the United Nations sent personnel to investigate and mediate, which finally eased the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. These achievements were all obtained through difficult hardships, and on this day of celebrating the birth of the United Nations, we must highlight them and cherish and care for them.

But on the other hand, we have to worry about the future of the United Nations. At the first United Nations General Assembly, the differences of opinion among the great powers were exposed. At the second United Nations General Assembly in 1947, Soviet representative Vyshinsky openly denounced American dignitaries as "warmongers" in the conference hall. Now, the third General Assembly is being held in the Palais de Chaillot in Paris. Because of the Berlin blockade issue, the Soviet Union and the Western Allies have been arguing endlessly, causing everyone to be fearful and worried, not knowing whether the United Nations can pass this serious test.

However, we always believe that the success of the United Nations depends on international cooperation and unity, especially mutual tolerance and concession between the United States and the Soviet Union. Today is United Nations Day, and countries around the world are celebrating it. We hope that the politicians and diplomats of the great powers can deeply reflect on this day, and everyone should support the United Nations with sincerity, abandon "minor differences," accommodate "major commonalities," and strive for the unity of opinions among the great powers, thereby promoting international unity and cooperation. In this way, not only will any international dispute not be difficult to obtain a peaceful resolution plan, but the United Nations will also have its beautiful prospects.

[United Press International, Paris, 23rd] The UN Political Committee voted 19 to 16, with 14 abstentions, on the 23rd to postpone the debate on the Palestine issue for one week.

This week has already seen two postponements of discussions on the Holy Land issue. When the Political Committee convened today, it unanimously agreed to discuss Palestine without objection, but a procedural debate arose over allowing representatives from the Palestinian Higher Committee to attend as observers, preventing the meeting from progressing. After an hour of discussion, Iranian representative Endisan proposed a postponement to allow a week to consider the request of the Higher Committee. Although the Soviet bloc shouted "political tactics," the committee ultimately passed the postponement. Katz-Suchy criticized Iran's reason as a "weak excuse," and claimed that the real reason was "political." Chairman Spaak prevented others from speaking to avoid prolonging the debate. He stated that the committee would reconvene on the 25th to review the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee, and then discuss the Greek issue, before adjourning the meeting.

There are also those who want to see us make greater efforts, or who will see our various omissions as strange." Jiang continued, "For these critics, I would like to respond that if we can do well in the present and future, it is not too late to clarify the responsibility for past events. I must also mention that seeking a final solution through peaceful means will make the problem easier to solve. At the very least, we can make an indirect contribution to the solution of the problem." To the critics who say we have done too much, I also ask the Chairman to allow me to respond. Among the various crises that have shocked the world after the war, the recent Berlin incident is the most serious. The world is alarmed by this, and people all over the world are shouting loudly, or whispering to each other, asking, "Will the great war happen again?" The United Nations Charter entrusts the Security Council with the primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. Faced with this kind of crisis, if the Security Council evades its responsibility, it will be a major blow to the entire world organization and human hope." Jiang concluded, "The proposal put forward by the neutral countries of the Security Council this time is very fair. This proposal has become a plan for every country to achieve glorious peace. If the Security Council can accept the proposal, this meeting will become a major decisive event in history."

The price of 110 yuan outside the counter was because business was slow and he intended to reduce the price for sale. He denied that there was any price increase as claimed in the police station. After his defense lawyer debated in court, the court decided to announce the verdict on the 30th of this month.

### 1,006 Pigs Detained in Yangzhou Have Been Released: County Government Explains Only 200 Were Purchased

[Report from Our Newspaper in Jiangdu on the 23rd] Regarding the report in Shanghai newspapers about the Jiangdu County Government intercepting pigs being transported to Shanghai, our reporter inquired with the county government to find out the truth. It was stated that the city of Yangzhou had stopped slaughtering for several days. When these piglets passed through the territory, they were found to be a large number. After inspection, they had no unified certificate from the Shanghai Supervisor's Office and no transportation and sales certificate from the producing area government. Some pig merchants had no association purchase certificate or ordinary merchant letter of credit. In order to prevent non-pig merchants from raising prices to purchase and create a black market, 200 pigs without any certificates were purchased with the consent of the original owner at the Yangzhou price limit by the county's pig industry association for flat sale to meet the needs of the military and civilians of the city. The remaining 1,006 pigs have all been released. Since then, pig merchants in Jinghu who hold a local government purchase certificate have not been detained.

### A Word of Advice to the Citizens of Shanghai by Police Chief Chiang Ching-kuo (Continued from Page One)

As for daily necessities, such as oil, rice, sugar, and flour, many people now find it inconvenient to buy them because they have to queue. However, I believe that this inconvenience is partly caused by the citizens themselves. For example, the existing stock of sugar and oil in Shanghai, even if there is no further production or import, is enough for three or four months. Moreover, production and import are still continuing. At the beginning of this month, many citizens were buying one pound at a time, but now they are buying one bag or one barrel at a time. If everyone could buy only as much as they need, why would the government need to impose restrictions? However, under the current circumstances, if restrictions are not imposed, the four months' worth of stock will probably be bought up by the wealthy in four or five days, which will lead to sugar and oil shortages. The same is true for flour. Because the source of wheat is not abundant, flour production is also low. However, I can say that the current flour stock in Shanghai is at least enough for one month. But if restrictions are not imposed and a rationing system is not implemented, the one-month stock will probably be sold out in two or three days. At that time, even fried dough sticks and sesame cakes will be unavailable. Although the current flour ration is small, it will not cause panic. Wheat will be shipped here in two or three weeks. As for rice, at the beginning of this month, the stock in each store was about 200,000 shi (a unit of dry measure), plus the rationed rice, which was enough for the entire Shanghai for one month. However, because there were no restrictions on the sale of commercial rice, the 200,000 shi of rice were sold out in less than a week. Although the supply of rice has increased recently, if restrictions are not imposed, even more rice will be sold out quickly. In this case, the poor people without money will suffer more. Therefore, the government has to stipulate that each person can buy five sheng (another unit of dry measure) with a voucher.

In short, many people advise us not to impose price limits anymore, believing that everything can be bought if price limits are removed. However, whether things can be bought after the price limits are removed is another question. Even if things can be bought, please consider that this situation will benefit the wealthy and make speculators happy, but the common people will suffer. Although we are making the people feel inconvenienced temporarily, the prices of rice, vegetables, meat, oil, sugar, and other necessities for the people are generally maintained at the previous levels. When we hear ordinary citizens, relatives, and family members saying that they cannot buy this or that, and when we see long queues in front of many stores, we feel very sad because I deeply feel that I have not handled things well. In this situation, the easiest way to shirk responsibility is to order the removal of price limits. However, in terms of personal responsibility and conscience, I should not, cannot, and will not do so. I am saying these things not to ask for your understanding, but to hope that you understand that this is the people's own affair, and to ask you to help us solve these difficult problems together. I believe that next month, if the people cooperate with the government, implement the rationing system, and adopt purchase limits, the Shanghai market will be able to stabilize.

The issue that everyone is concerned about today is not just the current few weeks, but how to achieve long-term stability in the future. Many people are concerned that the prices in Shanghai are low while the prices outside are high, fearing that this will create a situation where goods only flow out and not in. Regarding this issue, we should know why farmers are unwilling to sell their agricultural products. Farmers are worried that after selling their agricultural products, they will not be able to buy the industrial products they need. In fact, this problem can be solved. We know that Shanghai has a large stock of materials. Not only cloth and yarn, but also soap, matches, cigarettes, and other general merchandise are the best in the country. According to preliminary statistics, the Shanghai textile industry can produce 2,000,000 bolts of cotton cloth, 98,300 bolts of woven cloth, 120,000 dozens of undershirts, 1,290,000 dozens of socks, 4,800,000 pairs of rubber shoes, and 200,000 cartons of cigarettes per month. These numbers are very large. In the past, merchants from various places freely purchased these goods. Now, when merchants from various places come to Shanghai to purchase these industrial products, except for cities that do not produce agricultural products, they should be responsible for supplying agricultural products of equivalent value. The joint purchase and sales methods adopted by various provinces, cities, and counties can not only facilitate the exchange of materials, but also promote increased production. Cracking down on the illegal activities of merchants hoarding goods and raising prices is the first step in implementing comprehensive economic control.

The second issue that everyone is concerned about is whether there will be problems with production. According to accurate statistics, the existing stock of raw materials, diesel, and gasoline needed in Shanghai can last for at least three months. Cotton yarn is supplied by US aid, so there is no need to worry about shortages within three months. As for after three months, the jointly purchased raw materials will ensure that production will not be interrupted. Although there is a shortage of fuel at present, the government is stepping up its purchase and transportation, so no major problems should occur. The government has now allocated foreign exchange to purchase the raw materials needed by various factories from abroad. The government has always attached great importance to this issue and believes that only by increasing production can the market be truly stabilized. I also know that due to environmental constraints and difficulties in production and sales, the morale of the general industrial and commercial community is quite low. However, I hope that everyone will take into account the overall national policy and the difficulties of the country today to overcome the current difficulties. As for the profits that the industrial and commercial community should receive, the government is absolutely responsible and will definitely protect them. This is also clearly stipulated in the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. If merchants have legitimate reasons for increasing prices due to increased costs, they can apply to the local government to change prices. However, the industrial and commercial community in Shanghai must give up the idea of taking advantage of the economic chaos to obtain windfall profits. In order to ensure the safety of the entire country and society, and to protect the development of legitimate businesses, the government must adopt a strict control policy. This control policy will not conflict with the interests of legitimate industrial and commercial businesses. We know that running businesses is not only an individual right, but also a major obligation to the country and society. Regarding the price problem and the price limit policy, it is naturally an extraordinary measure, which of course is not immutable in certain occasions. For example, cotton must be more expensive in winter than in summer, and electric fans must be cheaper in winter than in summer. At the same time, I also admit that in some places, price limits may not be reasonable, but the basic price standard of August 19th is absolutely correct. At the same time, the economic control policy adopted by the government is also correct and must be adhered to. In the future, the government must strictly control important necessities and goods that have a significant impact on people's lives to ensure people's lives are stable and protected. As for other general prices, the industrial and commercial community should take the principle of not losing money and obtaining legitimate profits. However, speculative activities and black market transactions will never be allowed. Because speculative activities and black market transactions are not only harmful to the national economy, but also a disgrace to legitimate merchants. Only in this situation, by not allowing anyone to manipulate the market or monopolize the market, can a stable economic situation be created. This is our consistent attitude towards price controls, and it has never changed. Although the number of black market transactions on the market recently is not large, the existence of black market facts is an important manifestation of market instability. The economic control authorities will do their best to eliminate it. At the same time, I also hope that the citizens will pay attention to the fact that recently there have been many malicious people who deliberately shout out various black market prices and spread rumors to shake the market and incite people's hearts. Every citizen must strictly guard against this kind of conspiracy.

The road to success is paved by people. All new roads are often found in times of desperation. Today is a time of extreme difficulty, and new and good methods should emerge from difficulties and become successful. But we must know that this is a very painful and arduous task. To achieve great success, we must be patient and endure. Although we constantly encounter difficulties in the process of our work, no matter where these difficulties come from, they cannot be overcome. The most terrible thing is the lack of confidence and determination. Now many people, when they see difficulties, seem to start to fear them, and even start to shake their confidence and determination. This is the biggest enemy at present. I hope that all the citizens of Shanghai, based on the government's established policies, will unite and assist the government to protect the achievements already made in this economic reform and strive for the final success.

### Tightening of Credit on the Weekend; Market Interest Rates Rise Again

Yesterday, as the weekend approached, the city's credit market saw a shift from stability to tightening, with demand increasing but supply dwindling. Market interest rates rose slightly, exceeding the 20% threshold, generally ranging from 21% to a high of 24%. Cash funds were particularly scarce, reportedly due to a reduction in the amount that industry firms could withdraw from the Central Bank, owing to overnight position constraints.

It is understood that some firms in the city, due to the noticeable cash shortage and frequent customer withdrawals, have stipulated that cash withdrawals by customers be limited to the amount of their overnight positions to ensure operations. It is said that the daily cash withdrawal limit for firms has been relaxed compared to the past. In addition, the gap between market interest rates and officially quoted interest rates has widened recently, and people in the money-lending industry hope that there will be no rigid regulations to maintain the business of firms. An official from the Central Bank stated that the legal interest rate will be maintained, with lending rates at 3% per month and deposit rates at 2% per month. The black market interest rate is illegal and cannot be legally protected, and the Financial Control Bureau is working to eliminate it.

### More Than Two-Thirds of Legal Tender Has Been Exchanged

The period for exchanging legal tender will end on the 20th of next month. According to investigations, since the exchange began on August 20th, over two months, more than 4 trillion yuan has been exchanged nationwide, accounting for two-thirds of the total amount issued.

Furthermore, it is learned that the Central Mint has already minted more than 4 million steel fractional coins (one fen), which have been successively delivered to the National Bank for storage. The bank has requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance regarding the date of issuance. It is rumored that they may be put into circulation next week to speed up the exchange of small denomination legal tender and assist in completing the exchange work as scheduled. It is also heard that the Central Mint will begin minting half-dollar silver coins next week.

### Easing of Capital Outflow Situation

Yang Rumei, manager of the Hankou branch of the Central Bank, recently came to Shanghai to report on his work and request instructions on future business policies. Yang is scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow to discuss important matters with the Ministry of Finance. According to Yang's statement to our reporter, the Hankou market is relatively stable, with interest rates also stable, with daily interbank lending at 1.3 yuan and interbank lending at 0.8 yuan. The exchange of gold and silver is proceeding very well, with the most silver dollars exchanged, amounting to over 5 million yuan, with gold reaching over 70,000 taels, US dollars at over 200,000, and Hong Kong dollars at over 100,000. Hubei Province has abundant cotton and grain yields, with cotton estimated at over 1.8 million dan. Relevant parties have organized joint purchasing agencies for procurement, so there are currently more remittances to Hankou than remittances out, and the capital outflow situation has eased. Remittance restrictions have been lifted, but the amount of cash that can be carried is limited to 1,000 yuan per person. Any amount exceeding this will be forcibly deposited into the Central Bank.

### No Changes to Export Commodity Price Limits Next Week

[Reported by this newspaper] The Management Committee reports that the international market prices of our country's foreign products have been extremely stable this past week. Therefore, there will be no changes to the export commodity price limits for this week (October 25th to 30th), and everything will be handled according to the prices stipulated last week.

### Sugar Market Inactive

The sugar market remained extremely quiet yesterday. The association's allocation and sales system will be implemented, and member companies have recently been sending their inventories to the association one after another. Local sugar refiners and dried goods stores can apply after the quotas are determined, so confidence has returned, and there are no transactions in the market. After days of crowding, most citizens have purchased and stored enough sugar. Since the purchase quantity limit is very small, retailers have shifted their focus to other items, and the crowds at stores have thinned out compared to before.

### Rice Arrivals Increase Again, Rice Market Remains Inactive

The arrival of rice increased again yesterday. At the South Market, rice shops and rice mill dealers sold a total of 1,063 shi, and rice dealers sold 270 shi and 5 dou, totaling 1,334 shi. At the North Market, rice shops and dealers sold 691 shi, rice dealers sold 576 shi, rice mills sold 658 shi, and self-users purchased 272 shi, totaling 2,197 shi and 9 dou. The total arrival of rice at the two markets was 3,531 shi. The market quotations include white polished rice, Du Xian rice, rough pointed rice, and Jiangxi Xian rice, all at the original prices.

There were no transactions in miscellaneous grains. The allocation and sale of yellow soybeans continued yesterday, with 135 packages of Poyangzi yellow soybeans, 15 packages of black soybeans, and 91 packages of Jiujiang Duodou allocated, all without bags, at 5 jiao less than the price limit. There were no transactions in other miscellaneous grains.

### Textile and Construction Cloth Distribution

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market remained closed. The Textile and Construction Company continued to distribute cloth, including substandard 12-pound Longtou fine cloth and fine material, priced at 25.5 yuan per bolt (if there is not enough fine cloth for allocation, it can be allocated with substandard fine twill, without free designation). Also, second-class printed serge blanks are priced at 22.66 yuan per bolt (limited to stores with retail cloth licenses) for purchase. 29.5-yard substandard Biji blanks are priced at 23.5 yuan (limited to dyeing factories) for application. In addition, there is US cloth 002-B11 corduroy, priced at 1.7 yuan per meter, D14-21 crinkle crepe, priced at 1.5 yuan per meter, as well as Gangsi serge, Jianguo hemp spinning, silk spinning, Jianguo tweed, silk cotton flannel blanks, etc., with many applications for purchase.

### Slight Rebound in the Cotton Market

Because refabricated yarn requires cotton exchange, people are optimistic. It is heard that some of the cotton merchants' existing inventory in the city will be exchanged for refabricated finished products, which will be transported to the producing areas for further cotton collection. After the collected cotton is transported to Shanghai, it will be exchanged for finished products again. Therefore, the cotton industry has a glimmer of hope in this principle in terms of business.

### Commercial Briefs

The Silver and Money Industries Association recently issued an urgent circular to its members, stating that, as designated by the Ministry of Finance, the revaluation of buildings and equipment, etc., for capital increases by firms should be based on the national retail price index for the first half of August.

There are no transactions in the cigarette market, and the market is sluggish. The number of solo carriers has decreased because inspections are quite strict, and guest carriers cannot take them out. The deadline for cigarette registration is the 25th. Chinese cigarette factories report that raw materials are being purchased and costs are increasing daily, so production will be slightly reduced.

### Northeast Wind's First Battle Ends in a 2-2 Draw with the Railway Team; They Will Face Qingbai Again This Afternoon at 3:00 PM

The Northeast Wind team came to Shanghai, and their first friendly match against the Railway team took place yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium, attracting a crowd of 6,000 to 7,000 people, making it a grand occasion. The result was a 2-2 draw, with the Railway team leading 1-0 in the first half.

The Railway team attacked first and showed some advantage, but without any results. The stalemate continued until the 17th minute when Xia Shufu took a shot, which was unfortunately caught by Liao Xiong. Xiao Liuzi charged at the goal and fell to the ground at the same time as Yan Chengkuan. Xiao Ziwen passed the ball, but Zheng Bingyi headed it out. Half an hour passed, and Zheng Bingyi accidentally touched the ball with his hand, giving a penalty to Xiao Ziwen, who opened the scoring. The Railway team led 1-0 in the first half.

In the second half, the Railway team remained unchanged, while the Northeast Wind team replaced Li Chengxian with Shi Dafa. The team's morale was strengthened, and they had several attacks. At the 15th minute, Xiao Ziwen dribbled the ball deep and took a low shot, which Yan Chengkuan dived to catch. The referee thought it crossed the line and awarded a goal, but the linesman Deng Xiaoliang stated that it did not cross the white line, so the goal was disallowed. But in an instant, Zhang Jie came back and took a low shot from 15 yards, scoring another goal, making it 2-0 to the Railway team. The Northern spectators cheered for the Northeast Wind team and kept shouting encouragement. The Northeast Wind team attacked continuously, and Chen Qin lived up to expectations, pulling back a goal, making it 2-1. The Railway team replaced Xu Shengyuan with Fei Chunlin. Immediately afterwards, the Northeast Wind team came back again, with Xia Shufu crossing the ball from 30 yards out. Jiang Kun charged at the goal and headed the ball into the net, tying the score at 2-2. Everyone was happy.
