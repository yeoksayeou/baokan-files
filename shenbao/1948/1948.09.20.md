### The Focus of the Liu Defense Moves Inward: National Army Resolutely Ensures Suburban Positions, Annihilating Over Five Bandit Regiments in Four Days and Nights

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] The Jinan Defense War has entered its fourth day. Although the focus of the fighting is still four or five kilometers southeast of the city, the battlefield has shifted from Maoling Mountain and Yan Chi Mountain to the foothills of Pingding Mountain, Yanchi Mountain, and Guishan, east of Thousand Buddha Mountain, and Majiazhuang, two kilometers from the city. Starting from the evening of the 18th, the bandits switched to the main forces of the 9th and 13th Columns (with the Bohai Column as a reserve). Under the cover of more than 30 mountain and field guns, they again employed their tactic of using human waves to fill the sea of fire. In the fierce fighting until the evening of the 19th, except for Pingding Mountain, which was still firmly defended by the National Army, all other positions were contested repeatedly, no less than a dozen times. The artillery fire blotted out the sky, and corpses littered the fields. The National Army still secured its original positions. At the time of this dispatch, the fierce fighting was still intensifying.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] Around the Jingjiagou (north of Dajiachuang) area, about eleven or twelve kilometers southwest of Jinan City, some units of the bandit's 3rd and 10th Columns infiltrated during the dusk of the 18th. At midnight on the 18th, the bandits once captured Weihuazhuang, more than one kilometer north of Jingjiagou, but were soon repelled by the National Army. Another group of bandits infiltrated the Zhongdianpu and Zhaojiazhuang area, on the north bank of the Xiaoching River, about six or seven kilometers northwest of the city's airport, on the same night. After a fierce blocking attack by a strong National Army unit throughout the night, Zhongdianpu was finally lost and regained before the morning of the 19th. In this battle, Liu Tianxiang, commander of the 86th Regiment of the 29th Division of the 10th Bandit Column, was killed, and over 300 were captured. The rest of the battle results are still being verified.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] The Thousand Buddha, Pingding, Sili, and Baima Mountains, which guard the southern suburbs of Jinan City, are still being firmly defended by the National Army. After the bandit offensive against Kaiyuan Temple at the southeastern foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain was thwarted, Zhu dared to attack again from the evening of the 18th. Jinan City experienced intermittent rain on the 19th. Although the sound of artillery was intense, the residents remained very calm. Many civil groups voluntarily donated carts and organized stretcher teams due to the lack of stretchers and dry rations at the front lines. The Jinan press also organized a battlefield service corps to coordinate with the overall war effort and act as a guide for residents to assist in the war.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] Changqing is still firmly defended by the National Army. More than 2,000 bandits attacked Zhouguanzhuang, east of the ancient city between Changqing and Jinan, on the night of the 18th, but were repelled. At Fenshuling and Shicaiyu (north of Zhonggong), about ten kilometers directly south of Jinan City, some units of the bandit's New 8th Column and the Taian Garrison Brigade also arrived on the night of the 18th and were still fighting as of the morning of the 19th.

### Foreign Minister Wang Releases Statement While Passing Through Siam: Emphasizing Asian Good Neighbor Policy: Flew from India to France Yesterday, to Hold Lengthy Talks with Nehru in Paris

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 18th Dispatch] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrived here by plane from Hong Kong at 12:50 PM today. He left here one hour later by plane for Calcutta, en route to Paris. Foreign Minister Wang issued a statement to the local press, saying: At present, Asian countries must adopt a good neighbor policy to strengthen friendly relations with each other. The principles of non-interference and non-discrimination should be the basic characteristics of such a good neighbor policy. When Dr. Wang arrived here, he told the welcoming crowd that he had wanted to stay in Siam for a longer period of time, but his assigned tasks required him to immediately reach Paris. However, Mr. Wang continued, he hoped to fulfill this long-cherished wish in the future. At the airport (more than 20 kilometers from Bangkok City), Siam's Finance Minister Phra Boriphan Yukhanukunmontri, who had come to welcome him, said that the Siamese government felt deeply disappointed that it could not have the opportunity to entertain the Chinese Foreign Minister who was passing through the Siamese capital for the first time. Among the welcoming crowd at the airport were our Ambassador to Siam Xie Baoqiao and other officials, all the consuls stationed in Siam, representatives of various overseas Chinese organizations, and newspaper reporters. At that time, Foreign Minister Wang, at the request of newspaper reporters, issued his statement calling for a good neighbor policy, saying: Before World War II, Asia was actually in a state of colonialism or a similar state. Asian countries and their people not only suffered from foreign interference and discriminatory treatment from non-Asian countries, but also from the interference and discriminatory treatment of imperialist Japan. But since Japan's surrender, Asia has had twelve countries (or perhaps even more than that) that have either achieved independent sovereignty or are about to achieve independence. The number of independent Asian countries will soon be equal to that of Europe, but the number of Asian people is still greater than the combined total of Europe and the Americas. Foreign Minister Wang continued: "Asian countries should adopt a good neighbor policy towards each other's national relations, and the two major principles of non-interference and non-discrimination should be the basic characteristics of this policy. Non-interference in other countries' internal affairs is a principle that can promote international friendship and peace. Non-discrimination and fair and equal treatment of foreign nationals will strengthen political unity and economic cooperation among the peoples of all countries. For example, the protection of the rights of foreign nationals based on the most-favored-nation clause, protecting the rights of foreign nationals so that they are not any less than the rights enjoyed by the people of the country." Dr. Wang went on to emphasize: "Any deviation from this good neighbor policy will damage mutual friendship and allow strife and chaos to reappear in Asia. China has adopted this good neighbor policy and will actively strive to make the above policy prevail throughout Asia." Foreign Minister Wang then turned to discuss Sino-Siamese relations, saying: "Regarding this, I want to emphasize that China and the Chinese people have always closely关注关注 Siam's welfare. When the war ended in 1945, China did its best to have its policy accepted by all the Allied countries. That is, Siam was regarded as a liberated area freed from Japanese aggression, similar to the areas occupied by Japan such as China and the Philippines. The above attitude was supported by all levels of Chinese society. China's adoption of this attitude was purely out of deep sympathy and sincere friendship for the people of Siam. I think I should point out the importance of such friendship and understanding." Foreign Minister Wang concluded his speech by saying to the three million overseas Chinese in Siam: "I now call on our overseas Chinese compatriots to take all actions that can promote friendly relations between our compatriots and the people of their host country, and can eliminate misunderstandings between the two sides, and not to take any actions that damage the good reputation of the motherland. In particular, I hope that the overseas Chinese will understand that only when the countries where you reside can enjoy peace and prosperity can you yourselves enjoy peace and prosperity. The contributions that you make to Siam's development will not be ignored by the government and people of the motherland. I hope and firmly believe that this contribution will also be recognized by the Siamese government and people." Foreign Minister Wang and his party of three people left here by plane for India at 2:00 PM Bangkok time.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 19th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang and his party arrived here at 1:50 AM today. After having a meal at the Chinese Embassy, they left here for Paris at 3:30. Because of the limited time of his stay here, and because Nehru was unwell and had just held a long cabinet meeting, he was unable to meet with Nehru.

[Another Dispatch] According to reliable sources, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie will meet with Indian Prime Minister Nehru in Paris and will hold lengthy talks. Nehru will travel to Paris from London after the UN General Assembly meeting in mid-October. Before Foreign Minister Wang left here for France on the morning of the 19th, the Indian side delivered a private letter from Nehru to Mr. Wang.

### Resources Committee Works Hard to Expand Coal Mines in Central and Southern China

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Resources Committee believes that the coal shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai is serious, and the industries along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Guangdong-Hankou lines are gradually rising.

Commentary

### Discussing Current Prices and Evaluating Currency System Reform

— Luo Zhiru

Leaving aside politics, from an economic perspective, the root cause of China's current economic problems can be said to stem from three serious imbalances: (1) In terms of the people, consumption exceeds production; (2) In terms of the government, expenditure far exceeds revenue; (3) In terms of the nation as a whole, imports are far greater than exports. Of course, these three imbalances are interconnected, but many countries only exhibit one or two of these pathological conditions, without the other risks. This alone already constitutes a serious problem. China's current economy is beset by all sorts of ailments, so it is no wonder that it is difficult to cure.

Due to the above three imbalances, with prices being a key link, the following vicious cycles have emerged: (1) Speculation and price cycles; (2) Fiscal expenditure and price cycles; (3) Wage and price cycles; (4) Interest rate and price cycles; and (5) Exchange rate and price cycles. Due to the cumulative effect of these vicious cycles, not only has the economic pathology become increasingly serious, but it has also accelerated the deterioration. In recent months, it seems to have reached the eve of collapse, and emergency measures are necessary. The government's current all-out reform of the currency system is probably not because the opportunity for success has matured, but largely because of its emergency nature.

In the half-month since the currency reform, it can be said that a major problem, the banknote shortage, has been resolved. However, government spokespersons have solemnly stated that currency reform is by no means simply issuing large banknotes, but has far-reaching significance. Indeed, judging from the number of orders issued, the breadth of the scope involved, and the efforts made in the past half-month, it is clear that the government intends to break the vicious cycle from the price link, so that the entire economy has a turnaround. Seeing the urgency of the situation, action is necessary, but accepting US aid at this time, and hoping to continue to receive it, is also a major reason for initiating the reform ahead of schedule.

The author does not advocate that fiscal revenue and expenditure must be balanced before reforming the currency system. In fact, even if government revenue and expenditure can be balanced in the second half of the year, and no more banknotes are issued, it is not necessarily possible to immediately restore people's confidence. The current key lies in people's confidence. For ten years, rising prices have become a deeply ingrained habit. To say that prices will not rise at all is like a dream. If this habit is not shattered at once with overwhelming force, and then slowly stabilize the opposite confidence, any emergency measures will be ineffective.

To prevent current prices from rising, there are probably only two ways to go: one is "civilian," and the other is "military." The so-called "civilian" method is to allow the general public to obtain as much as possible payment instruments that they trust. With such instruments, they will naturally immediately restore their confidence, and prices expressed in these instruments can naturally be stabilized. The so-called "military" method is to impose price controls, prohibiting price increases by order, with those who raise prices facing death, or at least several years of imprisonment. The government's current currency reform measures are clearly leaning towards the latter.

On the eve of this reform, there were rumors everywhere that "Sun Yat-sen currency" [silver dollars] was about to be issued. But when everyone got the news in the newspapers on the morning of August 20th, they were surprised and disappointed to say, "Why is it still banknotes!" This kind of mentality is very realistic. In fact, the general public has never considered the various difficulties and drawbacks of switching to coins. But they think that the government wants them to exchange gold and silver for paper money, but they cannot exchange paper money for gold and silver. They just feel it is strange.

Experts have four concerns about the issue of convertibility: (1) Confiscating gold, silver, and foreign currency is not in line with the principle of private property; (2) The government probably does not have enough gold and foreign currency to exchange; (3) The price of gold and silver fluctuates at any time in the world market; (4) Gold and silver may flow into areas that the government cannot control. We believe that these considerations all have considerable reasons, and there is no need to refute them one by one. In particular, the second point is a factual question, so there is no need to argue. However, let us imagine that no matter how much gold, silver, and foreign exchange you have, if they are all used as issuance reserves, it is equal to something in a mirror to the general public. It is extremely difficult for them to quench their thirst by looking at plums. If you don't believe it, imagine if the government had announced this time that the issuance reserve was not 40% but 100% gold, silver, and foreign exchange, would the consequences be better than the current situation? Before banknotes became a problem during the war, people only knew that holding banknotes was more convenient than silver dollars. Why would they want to redeem them, and they would not pay attention to how much cash reserve was issued. But now banknotes have been a problem for nearly ten years. Regardless of whether a new type of banknote is exchanged, whether limiting the maximum issuance amount, increasing reserve funds, or strengthening supervision systems, the common people do not listen. This is a fact, and there is no need to shy away from it. Therefore, we say that if the government does not have enough gold, silver, and foreign exchange, then the opportunity for reform has not yet matured.

However, the drastic price increases in some places in the half-month since the reform do not necessarily mean that the reform has completely failed. Government spokespersons also made it clear to everyone that prices may rise in the short term, and there is no need to panic. Although the reason was not stated, we can imagine it. After each issuance of large banknotes, prices usually fluctuate for a while. Moreover, with the old currency not yet withdrawn, and so many new units of currency suddenly added, prices are bound to be stimulated. In addition, the government buys gold, silver, and foreign currency at high prices, and a large number of banknotes have also been released. So the current question is whether prices will gradually stabilize after this fluctuation? We need not predict. After this fluctuation, the people have painfully discovered that after three months, when the old banknotes are completely withdrawn and the limit on the new currency is close, the government may stop issuing banknotes. At that time, there may not be deflation, but a phenomenon of banknote shortage will occur again. Naturally, if the government in the near future uses the gold, silver, and foreign exchange that it has nationalized, or the property obtained from domestic people abroad, or the proceeds of foreign loans, for the convertibility of new banknotes, the situation will be completely different again.

As mentioned earlier, the government's current approach still focuses on prohibiting price increases. Judging from the immediate establishment of control agencies, the intensification of economic inspections, the arrest of price-gouging merchants at any time, and the imposition of heavy fines and imprisonment, the government seems determined to be tough to the end. But we deeply fear that after a temporary storm, things will still return to their former state. We cannot help but reach this conclusion, considering the following points: (1) The people do not fear death, so how can you frighten them with death? (2) Rigidly pegging prices to a certain day is difficult to do, and should not be done, even in normal times. (3) The price of one type of goods or service is often the cost of another type of goods. If you want to allow special pricing based on cost, everything will eventually have to be adjusted. (4) Price controls must be carried out in conjunction with rationing. Regardless of comprehensive price controls, do we have any preparations for rationing even a few major commodities? In fact, the prices announced by the government on August 19 were already slightly higher than the actual prices at the time, and during transactions, there may be black market prices, or the goods may be of inferior quality, or even "temporarily closed." From the above points, we doubt whether this price control will be more successful than the one in 1932.

Whether viewed from a political or economic perspective, the "civilian" approach is still likely to be effective today. In fact, advocating banknote convertibility at this time has the suspicion of going backwards. But thinking about achieving an immediate effect on prices after the reform, this may be the only expedient measure for the time being. In order for the new currency to be trusted, it is also necessary to prevent prices from rising immediately after the reform. Without reform, it can be delayed for a while, but once the new currency is used for testing, then confidence is the key to everything, and the stability in this short period after the reform is a matter of life and death. If prices, calculated in the new currency, also rise and skyrocket, it will be worse than not reforming. (From Chongqing University)

### Profit-Making Enterprises: Capital Stock Converted to Gold Yuan; Procedures for Changing Registration; Deadline for Completion is Before February 19 of Next Year

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has already drafted the Procedures for Converting and Registering the Capital Stock of Profit-Making Enterprises into Gold Yuan. It is now being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. After the Executive Yuan approves it, it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process and promulgate it for implementation. The procedures consist of 21 articles, and the full text is as follows:

Article 1: These procedures are formulated in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations.

Article 2: Any enterprise for profit (including various companies and sole proprietorships or partnership firms and stores) that has its originally registered legal tender capital converted into gold yuan after the currency reform, unless otherwise provided by law, shall comply with the provisions of these procedures.

Article 3: Profit-making legal entities (i.e., various companies) shall complete the conversion and adjustment of their capital stock in accordance with these procedures before February 19, 1938, and apply for registration of the change and exchange of licenses. Those who have not applied for registration of the change by the aforementioned deadline shall immediately dissolve and liquidate, and surrender their licenses. Those who should dissolve but fail to register the dissolution shall have their registration revoked by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.

Article 4: The method for profit-making legal entities to convert their originally registered paid-up legal tender capital into gold yuan is as follows: (1) For paid-up legal tender capital registered in 1937 and before, regardless of how many changes have been made in the past, the originally registered capital shall be increased to the value of legal tender in the first half of August 1948 based on the ratio of the national wholesale price index for 1937 listed in Article 5 of these procedures to the national wholesale price index for the first half of August 1948, and converted into gold yuan according to the statutory ratio of legal tender to gold yuan. (2) For paid-up legal tender capital registered in 1938 and after, the originally registered capital shall be increased to the value of legal tender in the first half of August 1948 based on the ratio of the national wholesale price index applicable to the year or month of investment listed in Article 5 of these procedures to the national wholesale price index for the first half of August 1948, and converted into gold yuan according to the statutory ratio of legal tender to gold yuan. If the capital in the first item and the second item above is subsequently increased and the increase in capital has been registered with the approval, it shall be calculated separately according to the national wholesale price index applicable to the year or month of the increase in capital, and converted into gold yuan jointly. Those who have reduced their capital and the capital reduction has been registered with approval shall be calculated according to the method in item 2 of the preceding paragraph based on the capital amount after the final capital reduction. If the capital is increased after the capital is reduced, and the increase in capital has been registered with approval, the increased portion can be calculated according to the method in item 2 of the preceding paragraph. The year or month of investment and increase in capital mentioned in this case shall be based on the date of applying to the competent authority for establishment registration or applying for increase in capital registration. The calculation formula of this article is attached later.

Article 5: The national wholesale price index applicable to the preceding paragraph shall be determined by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce based on the index compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, with each year from 1937 and before as the base number. From 1938 to 1940, a price index shall be set for each year. From the first half of 1941 to the first half of 1945, a price index shall be set for each half year. From the second half of 1945 to the first half of 1946, a price index shall be set for every three months. From July 1946 to the first half of August 1948, a price index shall be set for each month.

Article 6: When a profit-making legal entity converts its capital, the shareholders or directors or board of directors or unlimited liability shareholders who perform the business shall first formulate an adjustment capital plan in accordance with the provisions of these procedures, hand it over to the supervisors or appointed inspectors to investigate the actual asset situation of the company, issue an investigation report, and submit it to other shareholders for approval or to the shareholders' meeting for approval. The aforementioned adjustment capital plan shall state the year or month of investment or increase in capital of the company, the method for converting legal tender capital into gold yuan, the national wholesale price index applied, the amount of gold yuan capital obtained after conversion, and the amount of gold yuan capital to be registered, etc., and explain the company's business conditions and asset gains and losses over the years, and attach a property list and balance sheet, which shall be submitted to the supervisors or inspectors for verification. After verification by the supervisors or inspectors, an inspection report shall be issued. The inspection report issued by the supervisors or inspectors shall reduce the depreciation of each asset according to the value of the year of purchase, and refer to the national wholesale price index to separately and realistically estimate the current value, and provide opinions on the gold yuan capital amount to be registered in the adjustment capital plan based on the estimation results, and report to other shareholders or the shareholders' meeting. If it is necessary to supplement the company's minimum capital amount or the converted gold yuan capital amount with cash, opinions shall also be provided on the proposed collection. The supervisors or inspectors may entrust a certified public accountant to jointly verify and certify the execution of the aforementioned inspection and estimation tasks.

Article 7: After the supervisors or inspectors submit the inspection report, the shareholders or shareholders' meeting of the profit-making legal entity shall legally agree or resolve to adjust the capital and change the articles of association, and legally collect the share payment after the agreement or resolution, and then apply to the local competent authority for transfer to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration of the change within 15 days after the share payment is collected, along with the following documents: (1) Original registration license; (2) Adjustment capital plan and property list, balance sheet; (3) Inspection report and other opinions of the supervisors or inspectors, and certificate of verification of the case by the commissioned certified public accountant; (4) Certificate of shareholders' consent or record of shareholders' meeting resolution; (5) Revised articles of association; (6) Shareholder register after capital adjustment; (7) Form for change registration items.

Article 8: The amount obtained from the conversion in accordance with Article 4 of these procedures shall be the standard for the profit-making legal entity to adjust its capital by converting gold yuan. If the converted capital amount is within the standard range, it shall not be handled as a profit or loss item. When the capital amount obtained by subtracting all liabilities from the estimated assets exceeds the standard stipulated in these procedures, the excess may be used as the estimated value increase ratio and distributed to the shareholders, but the same amount of cash shall be used for cash increase in capital, and the increase in capital procedures shall be handled in accordance with the increase in capital procedures. If it is not transferred as capital, all of the excess shall be used as a public reserve fund, and shall not be converted into cash for distribution. When the capital amount obtained by subtracting all liabilities from the estimated assets is less than the standard stipulated in these procedures, the shareholders may supplement it with cash in proportion, or apply for registration with the capital amount obtained by subtracting liabilities, and apply for change registration in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article after the estimated value is increased in accordance with the first paragraph. The adjustment capital plan inspection report and property list and balance sheet shall be submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval before change registration can be handled in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article.

Article 9: If the adjustment capital plan, inspection report, investigation report, verification certificate, and other documents issued by the directors, supervisors, inspectors, or the certified public accountant commissioned by them of the profit-making legal entity contain any false or untrue information, they shall be liable for the criminal responsibility.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply to the amount of each share of newly established profit-making legal entities after the currency reform.

Article 12: If a profit-making legal entity has re-registered or changed its registration in accordance with the Registration and Handling Procedures for Various Companies in the Recovered Area, and its puppet currency capital has been converted into legal tender, the month and year of its application for re-registration shall be the month and year of legal tender investment, and shall be calculated according to the applicable national wholesale price index.

Article 13: When a profit-making legal entity converts its capital in accordance with these procedures after applying for change registration in accordance with the Measures for Reassessing the Value of Fixed Assets and Adjusting Capital of Industrial, Mining and Transportation Enterprises, the revaluation of fixed assets and the increased value portion shall not be included in the calculation.

### Promoting the Diligence and Frugality Movement; Forming a National Committee; People in the Capital Gather to Initiate

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The "Diligence and Frugality to Build the Nation Movement" advocated by President Chiang in the capacity of a citizen has been warmly supported by the whole country. On the 19th, people in the capital specially convened a meeting to follow the organizational principles in Section 5 of the Outline of the Diligence and Frugality to Build the Nation Movement, initiated the organization of a National Committee for Promoting the Diligence and Frugality to Build the Nation Movement, and immediately elected Chen Yuguang, Chen Guyuan, Cheng Tianfang, Zhang Daofan, Huang Shaogu, and 17 others as preparatory committee members to draft the organization charter, formulate a national publicity and organization plan, and expand the solicitation of initiators. Today's first meeting of initiators was held at 3:00 p.m. in the National Assembly Hall, attended by more than 100 people from all walks of life. At the beginning of the meeting, Chen Yuguang, Speaker of the Beijing Municipal Council, was elected as the temporary chairman, and Chen Bosheng, a member of the Legislative Yuan, was invited to report on the significance of the initiation. Chen stated that in response to the great movement of diligence and frugality to build the nation initiated by the President, they should change the unrealistic style of promoting general social movements in the past, and strive to practice diligence and frugality themselves in order to change the atmosphere and achieve the goal of success. The goal of promoting this movement is not the general hardworking masses, but the "non-working, non-producing parasitic class, as well as speculators who hoard and manipulate and use all illegal means to seize wealth," as declared by the President. It is hoped that the initiators and sponsors of this association will unite with the hardworking and frugal masses of the whole country to jointly combat the parasitic class and speculators, in order to correct the polarization of the lives of the rich and the poor, and achieve the goal of the front line being militarized and the rear being civilianized. Subsequent speakers were very enthusiastic, and all expressed their support for the organization's initiation of the diligence and frugality to build the nation movement. Subsequently, Huang Shaogu, Minister of Propaganda, read out the nine organizational principles in Section 5 of the outline of the movement. Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, elaborated on the organizational laws and regulations of the group. Chen Kewen, a member of the Legislative Yuan, then proposed to elect preparatory committee members to be responsible for drafting the charter, formulating publicity and organizational plans, and expanding the solicitation of initiators, which was unanimously passed and the election proceeded until the meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m.

### Explanation of Detaining Suspected Students; President Weng Responds to Liu Butong; Weighing National Interests and Determining Appropriate Handling

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Legislative member Liu Butong wrote to President Weng Wenhao on September 1 regarding the government's arrest of students. President Weng recently replied to Liu, explaining the government's detention of students suspected of endangering the country. In his reply, Weng stated: "The current situation is indeed much worse than before the Anti-Japanese War, which is undeniable. The reason for this is that the political situation is unstable, and the bureaucracy is corrupt, which has caused young students to feel angry and resentful. However, on the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party is actively working to spread acts of sabotage at a time when the country urgently needs stability, and is inciting anti-American sentiment at a time when US aid has just begun. Weighing national interests and the responsibilities of the government, it is impossible not to assist educational institutions in dealing with the situation appropriately. I have great sympathy for patriotic students and deeply hope that they will work for the progress of the entire country. Regarding those who have been arrested among the students, the main point of handling the matter is to quickly release innocent students and punish the guilty according to the law. Human rights will be protected in accordance with legal procedures during interrogation, so that there will be no unjust cases." Weng referred to Liu's concerns about the safety and studies of the students as "most reasonable words," and informed him that he had copied Liu's letter and his own reply and sent them to Minister Xie of the Ministry of Justice for review.

Passengers traveling from Nanchang or Hangzhou to Zhuzhou to transfer to Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces must connect at Xiangtang. Passenger trains run daily from Xiangtang to the east bank of Zhangshu. However, due to the fact that the piers of the bridge between Zhangshu East and Zhangshu West have not yet been completed, both must rely on ferries to change vehicles. The steel bars of the Zhangshu Bridge are expected to be fully erected before March of next year. To facilitate travel, the Railway Bureau is expediting the construction of a temporary bridge near the main bridge, which is expected to be open to traffic around November. From then on, the East can connect through Hangzhou to Nanjing and Shanghai, the North can pass through Xunyang, cross the Yangtze River, and enter the Central Plains, and the West can reach the Southwest inland through Zhuzhou. It is truly a central route for the exchange of materials between Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces. It is said that the famous Pingxiang coal in the country can also use the opening of the western section of this road to solve the severe coal shortage in the southeast provinces, which will greatly benefit the entire national economy. In addition, the official opening date of the western section of the road is approximately after Double Ten Day.

### On the Eve of the UN General Assembly Opening: Representatives from Various Countries Gather in Paris

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The Third UN General Assembly will open on the 21st at 3 PM (Paris time) at the Palais de Chaillot, with Argentine delegation head and Foreign Minister Bramuglia as acting president. About three people will speak at the opening: acting president Bramuglia, UN Secretary-General Lie, and French Premier Queuille, who will speak as host, welcoming the 58 member nations to France for the meeting. French President Auriol may attend the opening and deliver a welcoming speech on behalf of Queuille.

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Marshall left here at 1 PM (Eastern Standard Time) on the 9th to fly directly to Paris to attend the UN General Assembly. Republican foreign policy advisor Dulles and eight other representatives arrived here at 10:30 AM this morning. Marshall finished processing all important official business on the 18th and awaited the final report of the Moscow negotiations. It is generally believed that the East and West blocs will inevitably "engage in close combat" at the General Assembly. The situation is particularly explosive if the East-West Berlin dispute is put on the agenda and prepared for a showdown. The Soviet Union will undoubtedly attack the United States in particular, denouncing it as an "imperialist, expansionist, and world monopolist." The focus of the attack will undoubtedly be the Marshall Plan, French rearmament, and the newly established Western European Union. In addition, the issues of Palestine, Korea, Greece, Indonesia, former Italian African colonies, atomic energy, human rights, and freedom of the press will also be the subject of East-West debate. Accompanying Marshall and his wife are State Department advisor and Soviet expert Bohlen and his wife, and special assistant General Carter.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and the delegation led by Canadian Prime Minister King are all expected to arrive here today. In addition, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris arrived here last night with his delegation.

### Moscow Negotiations Still Yield No Results: Berlin Issue in Stalemate: Bevin Receives Report and Consults with the United States and France

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin received a report this morning from Special Envoy to the Soviet Union Roberts on the 18th in Moscow, along with representatives from the United States and France, visiting Molotov for the eleventh meeting. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office declined to comment on the matter, only stating that Bevin would consult with US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas and French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Massigli before examining the report and departing for Paris. According to well-informed sources, it is difficult to expect any results from this Moscow meeting.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] Responsible parties stated: The Moscow talks are still in a stalemate, with no prospect of a solution in the near future. The Western three envoys sent a memorandum to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, requesting that new instructions regarding the Berlin blockade be given to Soviet Commander-in-Chief in Germany Sokolovsky. Molotov has not yet given a written reply.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Many political figures here believe that the Berlin dispute may be submitted to the UN General Assembly. According to the UN Charter, if one or several of the six major powers cannot reach an agreement on any event related to one of the four major powers, it may be submitted to the UN General Assembly for handling. As for the possibility of submitting the Berlin dispute to the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference, most people here do not believe it will become a reality, because the Western three powers have long declared that they are unwilling to discuss the entire German issue under duress, that is, the Soviet Union is still implementing a blockade of Berlin.

### Third UN General Assembly to Open; East-West Cold War Approaches Critical Juncture

— Translated by Our Newspaper Translation Room

The United Nations General Assembly, opening on September 21st at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, will launch the most important diplomatic battle of 1948. The governing authorities of Western and Eastern powers are both prepared to "lay their cards on the table" there. Both sides believe that this General Assembly will be a turning point, namely: After this General Assembly, either (1) the tense situation will be greatly eased, and a workable interim solution will be established between East and West; or (2) there will be a frank recognition that an arms race is inevitable in order to determine the strength of the two major hemispheres that are deadlocked.

The Western powers are confident that their victory over the Communist parties in Western Europe is enough to strengthen their diplomatic bargaining power. The Eastern powers hope that the appeal and power of the French Communist Party will remain strong and be able to instigate large-scale citizens' assemblies and other demonstrations in Paris to create an atmosphere favorable to them.

Asia

But it is not only the East and West, divided ideologically, that are making frantic preparations. At the same time, the geographically Eastern, the majority of Asian countries, especially India, want to use the megaphone provided by the Paris UN General Assembly to present the almost irreparable economic plight of Asia and make an appeal for help.

"United Nations World" magazine received a report: The governments of many Asian countries are preparing to give a clear description of the serious state of unrest in their respective countries. They will point out that economic suffering is driving people to flock to the banner of communism every day. They will urge the Western powers to provide practical assistance as soon as possible to save this desperate situation.

Middle East

Although the Arab states have not yet determined their next steps due to the long-standing unresolved Palestinian issue, they are uniting to attack pro-Israeli forces. They will even use the threat of reclaiming oil rights as leverage and may temporarily abandon their membership in the United Nations.

The Arab countries feel that the political environment in Paris is more favorable to them than in New York. They also feel that the French government, which is deeply concerned about the pan-Arab unrest in French North Africa, will use its position as host to influence the other 57 governments to avoid offending the Arabs.

Conversely, the Israelis feel that in Europe, where people are deeply aware of the suffering of Jews under Nazi forces and understand their indomitable courage in successive resistance movements, the struggle should be favorable to them. In Paris, they are confident that they will not be subjected to the consistent condemnation of the United Nations by Jews in New York.

Latin America

Central and South American countries also intend to use the United Nations General Assembly to establish closer relations with Europe. They are planning to re-establish the economic, political, and cultural ties that were interrupted by World War II and have not yet been fully restored. Some Latin American countries are even preparing to openly demand the lifting of the United Nations' ban on Spain.

Spain

The Franco government will send several high-ranking representatives to Paris to meet with United Nations leaders at an opportune moment. This pro-Franco offensive will be initially promoted when Latin American representatives, especially those from Argentina, pass through Spain on their way to Paris.

Spanish Republicans in exile, although internally divided, are awaiting strong public support from the French people. They will never give in. They feel that maintaining the United Nations' ban on Franco is the only hope for promoting reforms in his regime. The majority of Republican leaders are prepared to accept any constitutional government that is ready to eliminate Franco and the fascists under his leadership.

Italy

Italy hopes that Paris will once again make the greatest effort to overturn the veto that opposes its admission to the United Nations. This veto stipulates that Italy cannot join the United Nations alone unless Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland, and Albania join at the same time.

Soviet Strategy

Insiders predict that in the first six weeks, the General Assembly will discuss routine matters, and the larger political struggles will only be discussed after the US presidential election. But the Soviet Union does not need to wait for an opportunity to attack. It is expected that they will definitely open fire before the US election in order to take advantage of the embarrassing situation of the US delegation on the eve of possible government reforms.

Veto Power

Small countries, led by Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and the Philippines, are preparing to launch a full-scale struggle against the veto power, but they may not be able to persuade one of the five powers to loosen this fundamental concept of the United Nations at this time.

It is expected that the most calm and uncooperative delegation in the United Nations General Assembly will be the delegation from the Union of South Africa. South Africa has its headquarters in the famous Hotel Elysée, where it has booked the entire floor of rooms to accommodate a large team of South African representatives. They are determined to curb "the Bolshevik's ridiculous interference in South African affairs."

The Host of the Assembly

The citizens of Paris are watching these large-scale preparations with great cheers, and they are very excited to see that Paris will once again become the political capital of the world during the General Assembly.

The French government is doing everything it can to equip Paris to stage a great international drama. Under the guidance of Carlo, France's most famous architect and decorator, the Palais de Chaillot has been transformed into the most beautiful backdrop for the UN General Assembly, as well as the most efficient office building. Huge holes have been created in the marble walls hanging with tapestries, where electric motors and construction shafts have been installed. In September, the latest elevators will move up and down in these shafts, so that the French will no longer complain that their buildings are beautiful but lack convenient facilities. The fountains from the 1937 World Expo will be revived here, spraying millions of gallons of clear water, shimmering under the five-colored electric torches, while the most noble symphonies will be broadcast from specially built music stands.

"United Nations World" estimates that at least 6,000 people will participate in the General Assembly, including representatives from various countries, secretaries, officials, experts, journalists, and representatives appointed by various groups and organizations. It is expected that thousands of citizens will come from all over the world to visit this historically valuable event. The French, in particular, will be the first to see it up close.

Judging from the situation, the number of people participating in this UN General Assembly will be more than any previous international gathering. Because of currency exchange rates, Paris attracts more viewers than New York. Most representatives are prepared to bring a large number of consultants and experts with them, and many are also bringing their families. Although most European newspapers have only stationed a few reporters at Lake Success, they are preparing to send a large number of reporters to participate in the General Assembly this time.

Hotel rooms have long been scarce. The French government is trying to arrange more spacious accommodations to facilitate the audience of the General Assembly. All facilities and hospitality will be standardized to match the tastes and habits of senior diplomats.

In any case, the general public feels that holding the UN General Assembly in Paris is not just a temporary gathering held at a select location. It truly represents the rebirth and rising status of Europe. In New York, the UN General Assembly is often just one of many major events; in Paris, it will become the only major event.

### Li Shizeng Discusses National Reconstruction through Thrift and Frugality; Advocates Less Empty Talk

Party-state elder Li Shizeng believes that in order to promote the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality, one should strive to practice and do less empty talk. He also revealed three things: no smoking, no drinking, and no eating meat, hoping that the people of the country will unanimously implement them. He recalled the work-study program of thrift and frugality initiated by Mr. Wu Zhihui and others in the early years of the Republic of China. Young people in the country who were influenced by this movement went abroad to engage in various labor work and accumulated funds to study, numbering no less than several thousand people before and after, which had a profound impact on cultivating a culture of thrift and frugality. Later, he and others organized the Jinde Association and the Social Improvement Association, advocating no smoking, no drinking, and no eating meat. He has strictly implemented this for 43 years, and many of his friends have also adhered to it unswervingly. Mr. Li is now 68 years old, but he is energetic and physically strong, which he attributes to the implementation of these three major precepts. Finally, he cited the ancient saying "Do not do a small good, and do not do a small evil," hoping that the people of the country will deeply understand and practice it, which will greatly help the promotion of the thrift and frugality movement.

### City Government to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Promoting Thrift and Frugality Movement

In order to coordinate with the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality initiated by the President, the city's Economy Movement Committee has specifically invited relevant figures from all walks of life to hold a meeting at the City Hall at 3 PM tomorrow, presided over by Mayor Wu himself. President Yu of the Central Bank and others will be invited to attend. According to Wang Guanqing, the person in charge of the committee, the economy movement, such as economy in banquets and economy in paper, has already been promoted in the city. Now, in order to implement the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality in accordance with the President's wishes, the committee will review how to strengthen the implementation of the existing economy measures and solicit opinions from all walks of life on the newly formulated savings movement in the outline of the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality. President Yu of the Central Bank will also be asked to assist in launching the movement. Wang also stated that the important issues of this meeting are (1) regarding the promotion of economy measures by the Social Affairs Bureau, A. Economy in banquets. In the past, it was very difficult to thoroughly implement this due to the severe price fluctuations. Although the selling prices of restaurants were restricted, they were still adjusted repeatedly. Since the currency reform, prices have stabilized, and the prices of banquets and set meals need to be strictly re-established. B. Measures for economy in wedding, funeral, and birthday banquets should be formulated separately with the most economical standards of etiquette and widely publicized. C. The crackdown on improper entertainment should be based on the principle of prohibiting while levying taxes and advising citizens not to go to improper entertainment venues, but to earnestly promote proper entertainment. (2) Regarding the promotion of economy measures by the Public Utilities Bureau, A. Reduce the number of automobiles. The lottery elimination system may be adopted for small automobiles to study the gasoline saved and transfer it to public buses. B. Economy in electricity use. Ban the sale of electric stoves. Ban unnecessary outdoor neon lights. Fluorescent lights must be equipped with devices to regulate electricity. C. Control tap water. Adopt a progressive system. The more water used, the higher the fee. Other items, such as promoting savings, will be discussed with the Central Bank to formulate measures to encourage citizens to save. The Social Affairs Bureau will promote the development of cooperative businesses and other items.

The Ministry of Social Affairs dispatched Zhang Zhaoli, Assistant to the Relief Department, to Shanghai some days ago to negotiate the implementation steps, and he is scheduled to be accompanied by Yuan Wenzhang, Chief Secretary of the Relief Committee, to inspect the various work relief centers in the city this morning. It is reported that the committee has prepared a detailed plan for the refugee relocation issue and is eager to implement it, but it has not been possible to implement it for a time because the central government has not yet issued the funds. It is anticipated that after Zhang reports back to Beijing, he will be able to present the actual situation of the city's relief work to the central government in person and assist in the strict implementation of the city's relocation work.

### No Meat to Eat; Xu Ming Went to the Vegetable Market and Returned Home with an Empty Basket; Authorities Determined to Arrest Those Who Illegally Manipulated

After the Mid-Autumn Festival, a serious phenomenon occurred in the city. Most small vegetable markets had no goods for sale, and those few vegetable vendors who carried goods for sale were immediately bought up in an instant. Meat was the most serious case. Housewives went to the vegetable market at dawn, and all returned home with empty baskets. The seriousness of this small vegetable panic is unprecedented in recent years. It is believed that this is due to some illegal elements manipulating the situation to resist the price limits on small vegetables. The economic inspection authorities have paid close attention to this and will take action today to arrest and severely punish this group of illegal elements.

### Economic Inspection Meeting Decides to Strengthen Inspection Work; Strictly Prevent the Outflow of Gold Yuan Notes; Vigorously Suppress Hoarding

Jiang Jingguo presided over the meeting to review the progress of work over the past week and decided to strengthen the economic control work this week: (1) Thoroughly eliminate the black market for gold yuan notes. Because the government's period for accepting and exchanging gold and silver foreign currency is about to end at the end of this month, although state-owned banks and various entrusted exchange banks have accepted and exchanged a lot of currency in recent days, it has been found that some people are carrying it away from Shanghai in an attempt to evade control. Therefore, the management authorities have decided to mobilize all forces to strengthen the inspection network in all aspects of land, sea, and air, absolutely preventing the private carrying away from Shanghai, and stepping up the search and arrest of illegal gold yuan note black market elements in the city. (2) The thorough investigation of hoarding, a general economic control measure, will also continue to be strengthened, and all efforts will be made to suppress speculative hoarders.

### Fish Market Scalpers Still Active as Before; Fisheries Industry Figures Reveal the Inside Story

After the implementation of the new economic policy, due to the authorities' strict enforcement of the "August 19" prices, the supply of some goods has been manipulated by scalpers. Recently, the activity of fish scalpers has become even more rampant. According to fisheries industry figures who spoke to reporters yesterday: Although the authorities are arresting and suppressing fish scalpers all day long, their activities are often difficult to detect because they have no special markings, which often makes it easy for inspectors to be deceived. He specially described the current distribution of fish scalpers in order to help all sectors understand the recent situation of the fish industry:

(1) In the Yangshupu Jiangpu Road fish market, due to the recent shortage of fresh fish, a distribution method is adopted. All fish vendors must line up in order to purchase goods. Therefore, illegal fish vendors send out female family members and even recruit unemployed vagrants to apply for membership certificates from the Fish Vendors Association, crowd into the ranks of fish vendors, obtain more fish, and increase their income.

(2) The 16th Pier has always been the main base for fish scalpers. It is said that there are now two ways to take advantage of the situation: A. Cunning fish vendors know that the fish market must comply with price limits and line up to purchase goods, so they use unscrupulous fish industry elements to intercept goods imported at railway stations, ports, and suburban areas (such as the main roads from Pudong and Qingpu to Shanghai) and directly transport the various fish goods to the 16th Pier to sell at higher prices through enticement and threats. If economic police officers inquire, they falsely claim that the goods were transported from the market and that the transportation costs and profits need to be increased, so the selling price needs to be increased. The inspectors are easily deceived by this glib talk. B. Another type of cunning fish vendors uses the single-handed running method of the enemy and puppet period, secretly going to nearby counties to sell fish and shrimp, covering the goods with clothes and bedding to avoid the attention of inspectors, and directly selling them at high black market prices to major restaurants and other wealthy diners in order to make huge profits.

The fisheries industry figure hopes that the authorities will protect legitimate fish merchants, so that the fish industry can be stabilized.

### Import of Luxurious Cars Reported; Supervisory Office Thoroughly Investigates

The Su-Zhe District Supervisory Committee of the Executive Yuan recently received another secret report accusing a senior official of a certain agency in the city of colluding with foreign car companies to privately import a large number of luxury cars. Since the government stipulated that cars worth more than 1,200 US dollars are prohibited from import, foreign car companies in the city have colluded with senior officials of certain agencies to privately import a large number of the latest luxurious cars produced in 1949, all of which are worth more than 1,200 US dollars. After receiving the report, the Su-Zhe District Supervisory Committee of the Executive Yuan attached great importance to this matter and has dispatched personnel to conduct an investigation.

### Taiwan and Huainan Mines Transport Coal to Supply This City

After the Beining Railway was damaged again by communist bandits, the coal source of Kaifeng was interrupted again. Now, in order to maintain the original amount of coal source, the fuel coal control authorities have specially urged Taiwan and Huainan mines to transport coal to Shanghai. It is reported that the Huainan Coal Mine will ship 6,000 tons of fuel coal to Shanghai today on the Luxing Fast Ship, and more than 10,000 tons of coal can also be transported from the Taiwan Coal Mine this week.

### Second Phase of Housing Lottery; Compiling Budget Plan to Continue

After the currency reform, prices of various commodities have gradually stabilized. The second phase of the housing charity lottery, which has been shelved for a long time, will be planned for implementation again. Before the currency reform, the housing charity lottery department was unable to proceed smoothly due to the difficulty in purchasing land and building materials. Now, Mayor Wu is encouraging the construction of houses on vacant land, and the purchase of land and building materials all have fixed market prices. In the future, prices will not rise again under the long-term control system. Issuing housing charity lottery tickets to solve the housing shortage for citizens is appropriate at this time. The housing charity lottery department is now compiling various budget forms. Mayor Wu expressed his willingness to strive for promotion.

### Advertising Industry Association Re-elects Directors and Supervisors

The City Advertising Business Association held its third general meeting at 159 Zhejiang Middle Road on the second floor yesterday. Zhang Hanyun, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhou Lianze, a representative of the City Party Headquarters, and Yu Yulin, a representative of the City Chamber of Commerce, attended. In addition to the chairmen Lu Shoulun, Sun Zuisheng, and Hu Tanming reporting on association affairs and discussing proposals, the directors and supervisors were re-elected. As a result, Lu Shoulun, Hu Tanming, Lu Meiseng, Wu Yunmeng, Ni Gaofeng, and Hu Xiongfei were re-elected as directors; Sun Daosheng and Cui Quansheng were re-elected as supervisors; Lu Dongsheng, Xue Shisheng, Zheng Xiaolun, Yu Jing, Yuan Jinchun, Wang Zhonglin, Cui Jialiang, Kang Jiyao, and Wang Shouru were elected as new directors; and Shen Qiuyan and Wu Zhuoran were elected as new supervisors.

### Money Market Continues to Loosen; Black Market Interest Rates Drop Again; Capital Flows Back from South China; Hoarded Goods Appear on the Market

Over the past week, the money market in the city has become even more relaxed. Although it is the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement period, the relaxed situation of the money market is unprecedented in the past. The four banks and two bureaus had a total deficit of 1.304 million yuan last week. The black market interest rate dropped to 7%, and banks and firms all felt it was difficult to lend money. The money market may continue to loosen this week because (1) a large amount of capital is flowing back to Shanghai from South China, and (2) prices are stable, and hoarded goods are appearing on the market, and there is an abundance of idle capital in the market. According to an observation by an economist, the loosening of the money market and the reduction of black market interest rates have a good impact on legitimate industries because the reduction of black market interest rates can invisibly reduce costs, which can indirectly promote production and stabilize prices. However, the authorities must not relax economic controls, lest speculators use low-interest idle capital to hoard goods.

### National Identification Cards to be Reissued; Plan to Print Rice Ration Coupons on Them

The city government plans to reissue national identification cards in the near future and plans to print the per capita rice ration coupons issued by the Civil Food Distribution Council on the identification cards in order to save paper for rice ration coupons. However, it is not known how long the distribution of rice will continue, so a request has been made to the central government for instructions. After a reply is received, the new cards will be printed and prepared for reissue. It is reported that after the new cards are reissued, the procedures for citizens to purchase rice rations will be re-established. Citizens will be required to hold the newly issued national identification cards and go to the allocated rice store to purchase rice according to the purchase date announced by the Civil Food Distribution Council. The rice store only needs to add a "purchased" seal to the corresponding square on the ration certificate, which is a very simple procedure.

### A Woman in Her Seventies, Family Thriving as Before: American Elderly Woman Circles the World Sixteen Times, Visited Forty-Four Countries, Met the Empress Dowager Cixi, Recently Arrived in Shanghai by Ship with Only Twelve Pounds of Luggage

[Our Report] Recently, the "America" transport ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying Miss Bali Xu, an extraordinary American woman with silvery white hair in her seventies. She is the number one female traveler in the world, having wandered around the world sixteen times in the past fifty years, and is truly traveling for the sake of traveling. Wherever she travels, she carries nothing but luggage weighing only nine pounds. Although Miss Bali Xu is now in her twilight years, she still raises her spirits to make her seventeenth trip around the world. This time, the luggage she carries weighs twelve pounds.

Started Traveling at Seventeen

Miss Ba is not only a traveler, but also a writer and an amateur artist. Since she broke away from married life at the age of seventeen and plunged into the Western gold rush, her life has been filled with romances, adventures, and all kinds of novel experiences in remote corners of the world. She has been to the desolate Siberia, the scorching Gobi Desert, the frozen poles, the markets of Baghdad, and the semi-civilized Pacific islands. She has also come to China and met the Empress Dowager Cixi in the Forbidden City in Beijing.

Wandering in Exotic Lands Without Spending a Penny

During the last war, she fulfilled another long-cherished wish: to travel freely in Afghanistan. Previously, she had once disguised herself as a pilgrim and tried to sneak into Afghanistan, but was discovered when she was about to succeed. What makes her travels different is that she does not need a lot of money. On the contrary, she often spends nothing. Miss Ba once said, "One must seize opportunities in life." A long time ago, she seized the opportunity to enter Outer Mongolia without permission. When the Yunnan-Burma Highway was newly opened in 1940, she hitched a ride on a military truck and traveled for twenty days. As for this trip to the East, when the ship passed Yokohama, she managed to disembark at the last minute and then arbitrarily took fifteen Allied Commander-in-Chief long-distance buses to wander around Tokyo and Osaka. Miss Ba recalled her hitchhiking experience and said, "I followed the American soldiers onto the bus. They didn't ask who I was, and I didn't ask them where the bus was going." In this way, Miss Ba enjoyed the most meaningful trip as she pleased.

Reliving Old Dreams, Beiping is the Best

Miss Ba plans to sightsee in Shanghai for more than ten days, and will revisit Beiping at the end of this month to relive her old dreams of forty years ago. She said that compared to wandering in more than forty countries, Beiping gave her the best impression.

### A Pedicab Overturned by a Collision: Female Passenger Dies Tragically, Pedicab Driver Injured

[Our Report] At about 2:10 PM yesterday, the 15th public bus (Registration Number 03-0469) traveling on Wanping Road and Jianguo West Road, driven by driver No. 761, crashed into a roadside tree trunk due to excessive speed, overturning the pedicab in front of it.

The passenger in the pedicab, Ma Xuezhen (female, 21 years old, from Anhui), had her chest crushed by the wheels, and her intestines flowed out, dying on the spot. Afterwards, the police officer nearby arrived and quickly sent the injured and deceased to Zhongshan Hospital. The driver was taken to the Xujiahui Police Station for investigation.

### To Reduce Losses, the Civil Affairs Commission Directly Distributes Food Upon Arrival

In order to strengthen work efficiency and reduce unnecessary losses, Lu Guixiang, Director of the Allocation Department of the Civil Affairs Commission, is piloting a direct distribution method without transferring goods to warehouses. This can eliminate the need for weighing, leakage, and storage loading and unloading. It not only reduces manpower and saves time and money, but also ensures that the amount of rice remains intact. The amount of transportation can reach 26,500 shi per day. This method has been successfully tested after the Zhou Fuyu ship transported grain to Shanghai. In the future, it can save a lot of manpower and material resources.

### Women's Progressive Association Holds Inaugural Meeting

The Shanghai Women's Progressive Association, organized by female painters Shen Yan and Zhou Lian She, held its inaugural meeting at 82 Kunshan Road at 9 AM yesterday after the organization was ready. At the meeting, Shen Yan, Jin Qijing, Zhou Lianxia, Bao Yahui and other twenty-one people were elected as directors.

### Police Officer Extorts White Rice, Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months

[Our Report] Wang Chengtian, a police officer from the North Railway Station Police Branch, was assigned to duty at the Xinjiang Road post on May 16th of this year. A resident, Shi Bingran, reported to him that Ni Jinping of the Tongqing Rice Shop on Xinjiang Road refused to pay for rice that Shi Xisong had bought on his behalf and requested that he go to investigate. At that time, trainee patrol officer Lin Weichi also patrolled the post and went to the Tongqing Rice Shop with Wang to investigate. It was true. Shi Bingran and others measured thirteen shi of white rice, which was to be handled at the North Railway Station Branch. When the rice was loaded to the entrance of the Juxing Tea Garden on Zhejiang North Road, Wang invited Ni upstairs for tea and asked Ni to provide four shi of rice for a settlement. Ni did not agree, so Wang turned to Shi and others to demand two shi of rice, which he hid in the stove room of the teahouse. He then reported to the police station that Ni was operating illegally. After the bureau sent personnel to investigate thoroughly, it was determined that Wang and Lin had jointly committed corruption, and Shi Xisong had colluded to commit fraud. They were all transferred to the First District Court. After trial, the verdict was announced: Wang Chengtian was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for using his position to extort property. Lin Wei was found not guilty. Shi Xisong's part was not accepted.

### Tram Crowded on the Bund Late at Night: Navy Personnel Clash on the Tram, Ticket Sellers and Drivers Injured, One Navy Personnel Also Injured

[Our Report] At about 10:15 PM last night, Tram No. 22 on Line 11, which runs between Hongkou Park and the Yangjingbang on the Bund, was passing North Sichuan Road when a person wearing a navy uniform and a person in plain clothes boarded the tram. The ticket seller, Xia Zhizhong, asked the person in plain clothes to buy a ticket. The person replied that he was a soldier and refused to buy one. When the tram arrived at the Bund on Nanjing Road, Xia asked the person in plain clothes to buy a ticket again, and a conflict broke out. As a result, Xia was slapped by a navy soldier. The matter was settled after other passengers intervened. The navy soldier and others got off at the Nanjing Road intersection and left. The tram drove straight to the end of Yangjingbang and then turned back to Hongkou Park. Who knew that when the tram reached the Bund on Nanjing Road, there were more than twenty navy soldiers gathered there. They boarded the tram and beat the ticket seller Xia Zhizhong, Ding Guangui, and Pei Chengjin. Pan Afu, a driver of No. 803 who was off duty and passing by, was also injured. At the same time, Li Cang was slightly injured on the navy side. Afterwards, the Huangpu Police Branch, which was in charge, rushed police officers to the scene. The Garrison Command and the Navy Disciplinary Team also sent personnel to the scene to investigate the truth. It was not resolved until 1 AM this morning. There were fifty to sixty trams stopped on the Bund.

### The Total Population Census Crowns the City with 5,040,000 People: Songshan and Penglai Districts are the Most Densely Populated. Wusong and Zhenru Districts are the Least Densely Populated.

The municipal authorities of this city, under orders during the period of suppression of the rebellion, have strictly managed the population to ensure public security and as a reference for policy implementation. The police bureau and the civil affairs bureau jointly conducted a city-wide population census, which has attracted much attention since the investigation began on the first day of last month. According to Director Yu Shuping, the general situation of the city-wide population census is as follows:

The bureau felt that the responsibility was great when it was ordered to jointly conduct the city-wide population census with the civil affairs bureau. Because the city has a vast area and complex residents, accurate recording can not only provide a basis for all policy implementation, but also ensure the stability of clearing out traitors and maintaining public security. Therefore, in addition to the personal supervision of the officers and police to strengthen the work, the bureau and the civil affairs bureau made detailed plans before the implementation and decided that 00:00 on August 2nd, 37th year (1948) of the Republic of China would be the standard date and time for the city-wide census. In addition to mobilizing all the officers, police, and auxiliary police of the bureau, the district offices, district chiefs, household registrars, and baojia chiefs also assisted, totaling about 50,000 people, and the city was divided into 4,800 groups to start working. By the afternoon of August 20th, the city-wide census was successfully completed. On the 21st, the supervisors conducted random checks, audits, and classified statistics. The preliminary statistics have now been completed.

Accelerating the Sorting of Industry Classifications

The original data for this statistic used the tally mark calculation method and was sorted by computer to completely eliminate duplicate populations. The city has a total of 984,152 households. The domestic population includes 2,714,554 men and 2,289,403 women, totaling 5,003,957 people. The foreign population includes 20,209 men and 18,081 women, totaling 38,290 people. The total population is 5,042,247 people. In addition, at 00:00 on the morning of the standard date for the population census, the floating population included 3,405 passengers disembarking at stations and docks, 17,491 tourists residing for less than one month, 13,077 transit ships, 15 transit troops, 8,190 homeless refugees, 1,914 beggars, and 2,502 others, totaling 46,594 people. After further analysis, the population distribution showed that the area occupied per person was 0.0000119 square kilometers, there were 8,299 people per square kilometer, the average household size was 5 people, men accounted for 54.23% of the total population, women accounted for 45.77% of the total population, ordinary households accounted for 73.05% of the total households, temporary households (slum households) accounted for 14.4% of the total households, industrial and commercial households accounted for 9.2% of the total households, and government and school households each accounted for 1%. The population density was highest in Songshan and Penglai districts, and lowest in Wusong and Zhenru districts. In addition, the analysis and statistics of the occupations, education levels, and places of origin of the people surveyed are currently being accelerated and will be published in the short term.

Facial Number Check for Convenience

The bureau has a city-wide population card system, and it is very convenient to find out the situation of citizens with just one minute of inquiry. After this census, in order to seek more scientific management, the facial number analysis method invented by Wu Yan, chief of the bureau's household registration section, was adopted to compile facial number cards to strictly control riots. Once this work is completed, it will be possible to capture criminals in the event of organization of the masses, prevention of bandits, fair conscription, or cases of abduction and escape, by simply remembering their faces and reporting to the police station to arrest them according to their facial numbers, which will make a great contribution to public security and administration. It is currently being processed and can be completed by the end of this year.

Evasion of Registration Will Be Eliminated

The results of this survey will be reported to the municipal government in conjunction with the civil affairs bureau and distributed to the Economic Supervision Commissioner's Office and relevant agencies as a reference for economic reform and comprehensive distribution. I am currently studying plans to strengthen household registration inspections in conjunction with the civil affairs bureau to consolidate public security and lay the foundation for protecting the various rights of citizens. I hope that citizens will recognize this point, cooperate closely, and voluntarily apply for household registration. If they know that there are unreported or hidden populations and people of unknown origin in the neighborhood, I hope that they will report them at any time to eliminate traitors and complete the major task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.

According to Ruan Guangming, Director of the Administrative Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, the business household registration was also handled during this population census. There were 9,076 households. It was found that more than one-tenth of them had been operating for three or four years and had never applied for a business license from any agency, which affected the police, customs, and municipal revenue. There were also citizens in this city who did not have national ID cards and used aliases to live in hostels or hide in tall buildings in an attempt to avoid household registration. They have been investigated and will be eliminated to maintain public security.

### Electrical Fault After Rain Causes Disaster: Cold Storage Warehouse Fire, Five Firefighters and Police Officers Suffocate from Smoke

[Our Report] A fire broke out suddenly at about 4:40 AM yesterday on the fifth floor of Qiaomao Cold Storage Warehouse at No. 20 Yangshuo Street in the Nanshi District. The flames soared into the sky. The fire department of this city and the fire brigades of various districts in the Nanshi District drove belt vehicles to the scene to extinguish the fire. Due to the excessive smoke, five firefighters and police officers (Squad Leader Chen Zhizhen, one police officer, police officers No. 25, 204, and 664) suffocated from the smoke. Fortunately, they were discovered by other companions and rescued. They were rushed to the police hospital for treatment. The fifth floor of Qiaomao Cold Storage Company was filled with a large number of bran, dried goods, and other items. Due to the impact of the heavy rain, the motor wires were damaged by water and exploded. Because it was not yet dawn, no one noticed. After the electrical fault, sparks splashed into the bran, causing a fire. The fire was brought under control at about 6:30 AM. It is said that Qiaomao suffered heavy losses.

### The Main Culprit in the Changsha Campaign: Japanese War Criminal Kanda, Indicted, Military Court Scheduled to Hold a Public Trial on the 23rd

Lieutenant General Kanda Masatane, a Japanese war criminal who was recently handed over to the Allied Headquarters by our delegation to Japan and escorted from Tokyo to Shanghai, has been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Shi of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense of this city and has been indicted. The president of the court, Shi Meiyu, will personally preside over a public trial at the court at 9 AM on the 23rd. The indictment is as follows:

Defendant: Kanda Masatane, male, 59 years old, from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, former Lieutenant General of the Japanese Army, formerly served as Commander of the 6th Division and Commander of the 17th Army. The above-named defendant has been deemed indictable after the investigation of a war crime case (No. 148 on Zhan Zhen Zi (War Investigation) in the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948)).

(A) Facts: The defendant Kanda Masatane is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy and the Army University. He has served as the First Chief of the Education Directorate General of the Japanese Army Major General, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters, and other positions. During the Sino-Japanese War, he served as the Commander of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army Lieutenant General on April 1, 30th year (1941) of the Republic of China (1941), stationed in Yuezhou, Changsha, Linxiang and other areas of Hunan. The defendant led troops to participate in the Second Changsha Campaign in August and the Third Changsha Campaign in December of the same year. During the combat period, his subordinates killed our civilians Yu Jianbao, Liu Dongsheng, Pan Yuebo, Liu Xiuxun, and others, raped women Li Chen Shi, Xiao Kong Shi, and others to death, set fire to more than 30 houses of Yu Shengquan and others, and robbed Liu Yizhu and others of five ancient calligraphy and paintings, as well as livestock, clothing, furniture, grain, and other items. After the victory, Kanda Masatane sneaked back to Tokyo, was captured by the Allied Supreme Commander, and was escorted to this court for investigation by our delegation to Japan.

(B) Evidence and Infringed Articles of Law: It is found that Kanda Masatane took over as the commander of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army on April 1, 30th year (1941) of the Republic of China (1941), stationed in Yuezhou, Changsha, Linxiang and other areas of Hunan, and led troops to participate in the Second and Third Changsha Campaigns, which is the fact admitted by the defendant and corresponds to the record in the War Crime Investigation Form sent by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. His subordinates successively robbed farmers Li Lunxian, Liu Yizhu, and others of ancient paintings, furniture, clothing, livestock, grain, and other items, set fire to more than 30 houses of Yu Shengquan, Long Shengan, and others, killed civilians Yu Jianbao, Liu Dongsheng, Pan Yuebo, Liu Xiuxun, and others, and raped women Li Chen Shi, Xiao Kong Shi, and others to death in Taizhong Township, Zhongfang Township, Wangjia Village, Yongmei Township of Yuezhou, Qingji Township of Changsha, and other places in Hunan from April 12th, 30th year (1941) of the Republic of China (1941) to January 2nd, 31st year (1942) of the Republic of China (1942). The victims and witnesses Li Lunxian, Long Shengan, Liu Yizhu, Xiao Yinchu, Zhou Shaoqi, and others have made separate testimonies (see attachments 1 to 6), which are sufficient to be adopted. During the interrogation by this court, the defendant first claimed to be unaware of it, and then claimed that it was not done by his subordinates, which was nothing more than empty words to evade responsibility. As the defendant is an officer in a supervisory and command position, he did not prevent or stop the atrocities of his subordinate troops continuously killing civilians, raping women, robbing, and wantonly destroying property. According to Article 9 of the Regulations on the Trial of War Criminals, he should be held jointly responsible. In accordance with Article 26, Article 2, Paragraph 2, Article 3, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 4, Article 24, and Article 27 of the same regulations, a public prosecution is filed.

The directors were satisfied and have left Beijing to return to their original places. Shui Xiangyun, the postal union director from this city, also returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning.

### The Sound of Ten Thousand Soldiers: The Haining Tide

— By Our Correspondent, Yang Shusheng

[Special Dispatch from Haining, 17th of this month] The "Haining Tide" is a world-renowned spectacle, both ancient and modern. When the tide arrives, its force is like ten thousand horses galloping. It is especially fierce during the spring and autumn tide seasons. The occurrence of the sea tide is due to the gravitational pull of the sun and moon. When the moon is close to the Earth, the tide is particularly strong. Because of the direct alignment, the seawater is pulled upwards, rising above the horizontal line to become a river tide. On the opposite side, the Earth is pulled back, also resulting in a high tide above the horizontal line. Furthermore, because the seawater is drawn and displaced, the water level is at its lowest. Therefore, the tide comes twice every day and night. The most famous locations for observing the tide are Hangzhou and Haining. Later, due to changes in the river tide, after the tide passes Beida, excessive sand accumulation has diminished its force by the time it reaches Hangzhou. Therefore, the Hangzhou tide is no longer worth seeing. However, after the tide enters Hangzhou Bay, it is blocked by sandbanks on the opposite shore, causing it to surge northward towards the Haining seawall, shaking the earth. Thus, the "Haining Tide" has been famous since the Southern Song Dynasty. With the arrival of the autumn flood season, the "Lonely Soul Tide" and the "Sea King Parade" follow one another. The eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month is traditionally regarded as the "Tide's Birthday." Every year, many visitors come from afar to witness the tide. The bustling scene in Haining City is not difficult to imagine.

Rejuvenation of the Town

During the war of resistance, the seawall fell into enemy hands, was neglected in repairs, and suffered significant damage. As a result, the tide flooded inland. Consequently, the river channels within the city were completely silted up after the victory. Through the diligent efforts of the Zhejiang Seawall Works Bureau and the local government, the Hangzhou-Haining and Changning highways have been successively repaired and opened to traffic. The three major seawall rivers of Haining, Ningyuan, and Zhangjiang have also been dredged in sequence. However, due to the severe damage to the town and the difficulty of recovery, the Haining County government has not yet returned to govern from the town but operates from the Xiashi Town along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway. The town has become an ancient city, desolate and bleak. However, every Mid-Autumn Festival, with the arrival of the tide-watching season, the town of Haining begins to revive. The seawall is now crowded with tourists from near and far. All kinds of temporary shops and vendors also flock to the town to conduct their once-a-year business.

Spectacle of the Night Tide

There is a local saying about watching the Haining Tide: "The first and fifteenth, the tide peaks at noon; the eighth and twenty-third, the tide comes in the morning and evening; the tenth and twenty-fifth, the tide peaks at dusk." Therefore, the first and fifteenth of the lunar month are the grandest, with the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month being the peak. The first high tide is in the late morning, and the second is in the afternoon. The night tide is an even more spectacular sight than the daytime tide. When the moon hangs brightly in the sky and the river is still, the wind suddenly changes, and a line appears in the east. Moonlight reflects on the silver waves, sparkling like snow. Waves roll like thunder, rushing and twisting, with a force like mountains galloping, making one's hair stand on end. The rumbling sound is deafening. Hence, the ancients praised it as "The sound of ten thousand soldiers in the midnight tide."

The Beautiful Scenery of the Tide

When the tide comes, it appears as a distant line, like a ribbon or a sash, gathering and scattering. In an instant, it changes a thousand ways, with leaping pearls and surging foam, like silver scales of dragons, one before the other, rising and falling. During major tides, the tidal bore can reach several feet high, sweeping over the seawall, its force astonishing. After the initial surge, the remaining force remains strong, the waves swift and rapid, and the sea surface rises several feet. The tidal bore is silvery-white, surging forward. At that moment, the second tide rushes in from the south, crashing against the bank. The sound is incessant, like mountains collapsing and the sea overturning. Then, the tidal bore rushes westward. After the tide passes, the river water is murky, and reeds and broken wood float along with the waves. The raging waves rise and fall, and the water level has risen. The ships docked along the seawall raise their anchors and set sail, creating another beautiful natural scene. Chen Shidao of the Song Dynasty wrote in his poem "Watching the Tide on the Eighteenth Day": "The year's grandest spectacle is today, how does the water god know to come late? Sea waves follow the mountains' rise and fall, and sails float with the traveler." Facing this scene, it is truly a joy of the world.

However, the local people of Haining do not regard the "Eighteenth Day of the Eighth Month" tide as a miracle. Aside from ignorant rural farmers gathering by the seaside, wearing yellow cloth bags around their necks and holding incense sticks, kneeling and worshiping the tide as it arrives, most are simply "joining the fun." Therefore, there is a saying, "On the fifteenth of the eighth month, watch the sea tide; on the eighteenth of the eighth month, watch the people tide." Every year on the eighteenth of the eighth month, the bustling scene is unprecedented, and there is barely room to stand by the seawall.

The Tragic Fate of Salt Farmers

Last year's tide-watching season saw the accretion of tens of miles of sand outside the Haining seawall, which restrained the force of the tide, so there was no magnificent spectacle. However, this year, the sand accretion outside the seawall has been completely washed away by the raging tide, and the force of the tide has returned to its original grandeur. Earlier this month, due to the typhoon, the tide surged over the seawall, inundating salt fields in areas such as Yuanmu in Ningxi. Tens of miles of seawall and stone embankments were damaged. More than a hundred salt farmers were swept away by the raging tide and went missing, their fate unknown. The livelihood of the salt farmers has been cut off, and cries of misery are heard everywhere. They are camping along the seawall, crying out for food. A committee to aid the disaster-stricken salt farmers has now been formed, and it has been decided to mobilize students from county schools, Lizhi Middle School, Jianshi, and Yanzhong to sell flowers for charity and expand fundraising to benefit tourists. Therefore, this year, there are many students running along the Haining seawall for justice, fearlessly appealing for the disaster-stricken salt farmers.

Rushing to Repair the Collapsed Seawall

After the victory, the Zhejiang Seawall Works Bureau devoted all its efforts to rushing to repair the collapsed seawall in the county. To curb the force of the tide, water-diverting dams were built in areas such as Mugang, Chenwengang, Jianshan, and Qilimao. However, due to the overwhelming force of the tide, dams were built and collapsed, and all have now been swept away by the raging tide. Near Zhuhui, the ten stone embankments with the characters "Gao," "Guan," "Xian," "Jia," "Du," "[blank]," "Zhong," "Li," "Cheng," and "Meng" were completely destroyed. Countless wooden embankments were also washed away. The safety of the seawall has a significant impact on the people of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. The County Council and local organizations have sent telegrams to the provincial authorities, urging them to accelerate thorough repairs. The Seawall Works Bureau has also launched an emergency repair project and is now planning to use sea sand to block the seawall, thereby protecting its safety. This plan has already achieved initial results. A sandbank about five miles long has appeared on the sea surface ten miles outside the South Gate. While this may greatly benefit the seawall's security, the world-famous "Haining Tide" may be submerged. However, to protect the seawall and the safety of the people, this is an urgent matter.

Haining has many scenic spots and local specialties. Scenic spots include Xiashi Shuangshan, Huangwan Jianshan, and along the seawall are the Sea God Temple, Zhenhai Pagoda, Daguan Pavilion, Little Putuo, Seaside Park, Anguo Temple, Anlan Garden, etc. Local specialties include watermelons, peaches, winter vegetables, white chrysanthemums, du cloth, sugarcane, silk floss, and crispy candy, all of which are inexpensive and high-quality local products, worthy of introduction to tourists. The truth of the jealous murder has come to light.

### The Jiading True Sage Bloodshed Case: The Murderer Ding Qingxiang Apprehended
The Truth of the Jealous Murder Has Come to Light

[Dispatch from Jiading, 16th of this month] A tragic murder occurred in Zhengsheng Township, a county territory. The victim, Hua Liangsheng, was sent to Renji Hospital in Shanghai for treatment immediately after the incident, but is still in danger. The murderer, Ding Qingxiang, is a stonemason who also runs a butcher shop in Huangdu Town. He has a wife and a concubine. Ding's wife is Hua Liangsheng's cousin, and there were allegations of indecent behavior between them. Ding had long harbored the intention to kill Hua but had no opportunity. On the morning of the incident, Ding rode a bicycle to the scene, hiding near a deserted tomb, waiting for an opportunity. Hua was returning home from buying vegetables, passing by the location. Unprepared, he was hacked in the head. Seeing his objective achieved, Ding returned to Huangdu, changed his blood-stained clothes, and fled. When the county police bureau and detectives arrived at Huangdu, Ding had already fled far away. They took Ding's wife and apprentices to the county for questioning and seized the blood-stained clothing at his home. It was revealed that Ding had fled to Taihu Lake in Suzhou. The Nanxiang Police Sub-Bureau and the Zhengsheng Township Office learned that Ding was hiding in the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road in Shanghai and sent personnel to Shanghai to coordinate with the Old Zha Sub-Bureau. They went to the hotel address and apprehended Ding in Room 304. After questioning, he confessed without denial and has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.

### The Suffering of Central China

— Special Correspondent, Ling Songshou

[Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 12th of this month] In my previous dispatch from northern Henan, I mentioned that extracting blood from the people is no longer a matter of whether it hurts, but whether they have any blood left. The former chairman of Henan Province, Liu Maoen, also repeatedly told me after the recovery of Kaifeng that the issue of Henan providing grain is not whether the people of Henan are willing to provide it, but that Henan simply has no grain. Therefore, despite the provincial government sending officials to urge collection, the commissioner's office sending personnel to supervise collection, and the county magistrate going to the countryside to sit in and collect...for example, the county magistrate of Fanshui County sent people with shackles to the countryside to urge the collection of grain this spring, resulting in the deaths of more than ten people, yet the grain collected was still less than 30%. Another example is that Guangwu County sent personnel to urge the collection of grain, crossing the county boundary to Rongyang to seize grain households, resulting in an unnecessary disturbance, and so on. However, urging collection, supervising collection, and sitting in collection cannot conjure a single grain of wheat from an empty granary in the countryside. The fierce battles in the flooded areas were unprecedented in the process of suppressing bandits: thousands of miles of plains have lost their original forms of fields. In northern Henan, there have been unprecedented floods. Although the grain shortage in Bianzheng did not start today, it is now more severe. The Henan Provincial Department of Land and Food has telegraphed the Ministry of Food for monthly grain supplies, but there has been no response in the past two months.

Years of war have left the people extremely impoverished, yet there are many levies and frequent corvée labor. This is a headache for the town chiefs and ward heads who specialize in handling levies. Eight of the nine town chiefs in Zhengzhou City have submitted their resignations to the county magistrate. In the Kaifeng newspapers before the fall of Kaifeng, the words "collapsed ward" and "destroyed village" could be seen almost every day.

A collapsed ward or a destroyed village means that the township ward head and ward head have been forced to run away by those urging and demanding grain to avoid being beaten. In the worst cases, all the ward heads and ward heads in more than 20 streets in Kaifeng City had fled. The troops demanding grain would arrest ward personnel when they saw them, detain them temporarily, and only release them when the grain was collected. As for the countryside, the death from forced grain collection seems unremarkable. Here's a joke: Chairman Feng of the Zhengzhou County Council said with tears in his eyes at a symposium: "The people have paid all their grain to the government, what else should the government want?" I casually mentioned this to another person, and he said, "I can answer on their behalf—their lives!"

When I arrived in Jiaozuo, several standing directors of the Coal Mine Workers' Union, Geng Xialong and Zheng Fangyu, rushed to see me. The 20-minute conversation was also full of tears.

The treatment of coal miners in Jiaozuo would make workers in Beijing and Shanghai laugh. Before May, their wages were only one to two million per month. From June, they began to calculate according to the index. Converted to the current price of wheat, the average person could not afford to buy one stone of wheat. Some furnace workers could not afford to buy even half a catty of flour with their daily earnings. They had nothing to eat, and the workers fainted while firing the furnace. The coal mine is an isolated island. The company has no money, and only half of the June wages have been paid. Most of the workers are surviving by selling things. When they return home, their wives and children cry in their threadbare coats. Yet they still have to bear the levies. In June, a worker surnamed × received a notice from the ward office demanding a military wheat levy of 375.2 catties, which is two and a half months' wages. In terms of military service, the ward head and ward head can arrest people at will. Recently, two technical workers were arrested. Technical workers can be deferred from military service according to the military service law, but this is a case of "heaven is high and the emperor is far away." It is impossible to get them back without buying two people and sending them away with more than twenty stones of wheat. The two ordinary workers who were arrested at the same time had no way to collect more than twenty stones of wheat, so they had to let them handle it.

In Jiaozuo, if households cannot pay the grain levy or the apportionment, the ward head and ward head can take their quilts and pots and use them to offset the price of three or five sheng of wheat as their rations. On the day I arrived in Jiaozuo, Zhang Dongquan, the ward head of the sixth ward in Jiaozuo, led troops to a household to demand grain. It was already noon, and the ward head wanted to eat. The household fried eggs and cooked noodles for them, but the ward head insisted on going to a restaurant. As a result, he was taken to the headquarters of a certain brigade of the garrison to resolve the issue.

Under the dual pressure of extortion and harassment in Jiaozuo, the population is decreasing day by day. When it was taken over, there were more than 4,200 households. Now, only one-third remains. People in Jiaozuo say that if this continues for two more months, Jiaozuo will be finished. Mobilizing for the suppression of rebellion is something that the whole country should support, each doing their best in their positions. Giving money if you have money and giving effort if you have effort is a matter of principle, but the facts are somewhat different from the ideal.

The party secretary of Henan Province, Yan Huatang, said, "Now it's a matter of not giving money if you have money, and giving even more money if you give effort." The chairman of the Zhengzhou Farmers' Association said even more painfully, "If you teach them to give effort and then give money, please don't bully them anymore!" Looking at the many difficulties facing Central China today and recalling the peace and prosperity of Jiangnan, it is no wonder that Liu Jixue, a revolutionary elder representing the people of Henan (the provincial speaker), shouted loudly in protest. After the Battle of Kaifeng, Minister Gu Zhenggang flew to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng to express his condolences. In his talks with various sectors of Henan society, he repeatedly emphasized, "The credit lies with the country, and the misfortune lies with the local area. This kind of expression, where a region bears a heavy responsibility for the country and the nation, is a supreme honor!" But who knows that this honor is woven with countless blood and tears?

When Zhang Kejun, the county magistrate of Zheng County, talked to me about these things, he couldn't help but frown. He said with great emotion, "A local official can't do anything. If the levies are not strong, I will be sorry to the country. But looking at the people today, it's not a matter of what levy, but I can't even say the word 'levy'!"

Zhengzhou is a fortress in Central China, and it is undeniable that it places emphasis on city defense works. According to the report of the person in charge of the city defense headquarters, from September of last year to June of this year, in ten months, a total of about 10 million civilian laborers were collected (calculated at one day of work per person). This can also be calculated. Averaging ten million workers over 300 days means that 33,000 to 34,000 people have to work on the city defense works of the township every day. Although Zhengzhou has a large population, more than 100,000 are refugees from outside. The population of Zhengzhou City itself is at most between 200,000 and 250,000. After excluding the elderly, weak, women, and children, and those who have the right to be exempt from grain levies and corvée labor, the young and strong are roughly 100,000. A division shows that each person has to work once every three days during these ten months. This is also a point in Chairman Feng's painful remarks: since the War of Resistance, Zhengzhou has been working on construction every day for eleven years, but where is the construction?

In Kaifeng, I heard several seniors from Henan say, "The people of Henan have good physical strength and good conscience. All troops love soldiers from Henan." Because of this, Henan has provided more than 2 million soldiers from the War of Resistance to the present. Two million can roughly form 100 reorganized divisions according to the current organization. The people of Henan are not afraid to be soldiers, especially in today's rural areas where eating is a problem. The source of soldiers cannot necessarily be said to be exhausted, but there are many problems outside of the main topic of conscription.

Because Henan is a good place, troops with vacancies casually drag strong men in the countryside to make up the numbers. This kind of pulling does not follow formal procedures, and the strong men pulled cannot be used to offset the quota. Therefore, the military divisions and districts must still draw and collect troops. Conscription is done by using bought strong men to make up the numbers. This has almost become a public fact everywhere. With a flexible solution, there are bound to be drawbacks: the strong men are sent to the regimental or divisional areas, escape halfway, and then sell themselves again; the township ward head and ward heads take the opportunity to extort the good people and exploit the villagers.

It's a little different. Yan Huatang, the director of the Henan Provincial Party Department, said, "Now it's a matter of not giving money if you have money, and giving even more money if you give effort." The chairman of the Zhengzhou Farmers' Association said even more painfully, "If you teach them to give effort and then give money, please don't bully them anymore!" Looking at the four borders of Central China today and remembering the peace and prosperity of Jiangnan, it is no wonder that Liu Jixue, a revolutionary elder representing the people of Henan (the provincial speaker), shouted loudly in protest. After the Battle of Kaifeng, Minister Gu Zhenggang flew to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng to express his condolences. In his talks with various sectors of Henan society, he repeatedly emphasized, "The credit lies with the country, and the misfortune lies with the local area. This kind of expression, where a region bears a heavy responsibility for the country and the nation, is a supreme honor!" But who knows that this honor is woven with countless blood and tears?

### The Opening of the Autumn Cocoon Market in Wuxi

[Dispatch from Wuxi] The autumn orchids from the four villages have appeared on the market one after another. The two silk shops in the county officially opened on the 19th. Regarding the price of cocoons, the Silk Factory Association decided to formulate two types of prices in accordance with the laws and regulations and the past regulations of the Guidance Association and directly requested instructions from the county government and the provincial government. It is understood that the provincial government has already stipulated the autumn and spring prices in Jiangsu Province and decided to officially announce them on the 18th of this month, roughly based on four stones of rice as the principle. In addition, the government has stopped loans for silk cocoons in the Di season this year and will borrow from commercial banks in the form of ordinary commercial loans in the future.

### Illegal Possession of Firearms Confiscated

[Dispatch from Wuxi, 18th of this month] Zhou Aqi and Lu Bingrong of Xinan Town, Taizhu District, used their authority last month to threaten Jiang Zhonglun, the ward head of a ward, by tying him up at home. After the Xizhong Bureau learned about it, they detained Zhou and others and sent them to Zhenjiang for interrogation. Then they were released on bail to return to Wuxi, but Zhou and others did not hand over two short guns. Yesterday, Zhou Aqi came to the city from the countryside and was arrested by the criminal police team at the South Gate and sent to the county for interrogation.

### The Xiangtan Salt Workers Tragedy: The County Government Pursues Responsibility; The General Affairs and Accounting Personnel Flee One After Another

[Dispatch from Changsha, 19th of this month] After the tragedy at the Yong'an Gaoyan Salt Company in Xiangtan, all parties expressed dissatisfaction with the company's lack of precautions, especially the regulation that workers work for 70 hours, which is inhumane. After the incident, the company's general affairs manager, Xiao Tongsheng, and accountant, Luo Jingao, fled one after another. In order to investigate responsibility, the county government has detained the chief manager, Hu Xin. More than 200 family members of the deceased surrounded engineer Shen Ruoyu on the 18th, their cries shaking the sky, which was unbearable to hear. It is heard that the post-disaster settlement measures are set as: (1) issuing 100 yuan per person for funeral expenses, (2) issuing 600 yuan for consolation money, and (3) investigating and clarifying responsibilities and punishing them separately.

### Registering Overseas Assets: Wealthy Migrants in Hong Kong Sit on Pins and Needles

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Zi Jian

[Hong Kong Dispatch from This Newspaper, 15th] Since the news of the government's decision to register overseas assets of Chinese citizens reached Hong Kong, wealthy Chinese in Hong Kong, especially the mainland tycoons who migrated to Hong Kong, have been in a state of panic. It is said that two reputable commercial banks with head offices in Shanghai have experienced a run on deposits in their Hong Kong branches in recent days. The tycoons are even more anxious upon hearing that the two banks send quarterly reports back to their Shanghai headquarters. Foreign banks here are already overflowing with deposits and are unceremoniously rejecting the tycoons' floating capital. Unable to deposit their Hong Kong dollars, they have no choice but to convert them into US dollars and secretly hoard them at home to see how the situation develops. In the past two days, the US dollar has bucked its previous sluggish trend and risen repeatedly, from HK$4.90 to HK$5.20 per dollar, influenced by their actions.

Whether the government has indeed obtained the understanding of the Hong Kong government to establish a registration office for Chinese assets in Hong Kong is still a matter of speculation and disagreement. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank's representative office in Hong Kong, the amount of foreign exchange assets held by Chinese in Hong Kong is second only to New York. Other places such as London, Calcutta, and San Francisco are not as important as Hong Kong. Guo Dehua, the special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, has been summoned to Beijing to discuss the registration work. This "mystery" is expected to be revealed soon. Furthermore, according to relevant statistics, the total value of banknotes issued by the three major banks in Hong Kong up to July of this year was HK$752.6 million, which is an increase of 2.58% compared to the issuance amount on June 30, 1948, and an increase of 20% compared to the issuance amount at the end of last year.

The proportion of banknotes issued by the three major banks in Hong Kong is as follows: HSBC accounts for the largest share at 92.52%, Standard Chartered Bank accounts for 7.08%, and the Mercantile Bank has the smallest share at only 0.4%. Before the war, i.e., on December 31, 1938, the proportions of banknotes issued by each bank were as follows: HSBC accounted for 86.81%, Standard Chartered Bank accounted for 10.94%, and the Mercantile Bank accounted for 2.25%.

The number of banknotes issued by each bank before the war (end of 1937) was only about one-third of the current amount, calculated as follows: (1) HSBC: $199,689,793. (2) Standard Chartered Bank: $25,172,604. (3) Mercantile Bank: $5,175,570.

Wuxing

[Dispatch from This Newspaper] The total business tax declared by all shops in the county, when converted into Gold Yuan, is only 10,000 per month. The provincial government believes that the collection agencies are ineffective and has sent three commissioners to Lake (Wuxing) to investigate. The county chamber of commerce, fearing that merchants would be uneasy, immediately convened an emergency meeting of leaders from various industries and contacted the provincial commission several times. As a result, it was agreed that from September, the total business tax for all industries in the county would be provisionally reported and paid as 50,000 Gold Yuan (a fourfold increase), with the urban area accounting for 60% and the rural towns accounting for 40%. For August, each industry will report the actual amount, and the tax bureau will assess and approve it at its discretion to show consideration.

Shaoxing

[Dispatch from This Newspaper] The salt fields in the 12th division, Tongjiata, and Wengjiabu areas under the jurisdiction of Qianqingchang were submerged by a raging tide, with waves reaching over ten feet high. Thatched houses, salt pans, salt-making equipment, etc., in the area were all submerged.

### General Commodity Prices: The New Plan Achieves Initial Success, But the Future is Not Without Obstacles

It has been exactly one month since the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs and the implementation of currency reform, up to the end of last week. As far as the market in this city is concerned, prices have gradually stabilized, and transactions have also become normal. The initial success of the new plan is encouraging and exciting, and it is difficult to express in words. However, "the last mile is the hardest." Looking ahead to this arduous journey, we are still far from the ultimate goal of success, and we need even more active efforts and vigilance!

Regarding the current more prominent pathological conditions: (1) Shanghai has strict controls, while other areas have lax controls. Shanghai adheres to price limits, while other areas still have phenomena of prices exceeding the limits. (2) Floating capital is still loose and excessive, and it seems that a proper destination has not yet been found. (3) The case of commercial banks and firms transferring foreign exchange to state-owned banks has not yet been thoroughly implemented. (4) Since the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, the circulation has shrunk, which is also a major event worth noting. The registration of foreign exchange assets of citizens overseas does not seem to be proceeding actively enough.

More Flexible Implementation of Measures for the Export of Goods

Due to the authorities' ban on carrying goods out of the country in the previous week, the commodity market trend last week saw frequent declines within the price limits on Monday and Tuesday. However, after Tuesday, the Commodity Adjustment Committee decided that the application for permits to export prohibited goods would be the responsibility of the trade association to review and issue permits, and the association would report the quantity of goods permitted for export and the number of permits issued to the supervisor's office on a ten-day basis for verification. Under this stimulus of allowing exports, various goods rebounded again. Therefore, the authorities are considering a more cautious implementation of the measures for carrying goods out of the country. At the same time, the trade associations are also technically more flexible in their regulations regarding the export of goods. For example, the cotton textile, cotton cloth, and yarn merchants' associations have drafted key points for the implementation rules regarding yarn and cloth exports: (1) To avoid stimulating local market prices through yarn and cloth exports, the association may adjust them at any time depending on market price fluctuations and supply and demand conditions in various regions. In other words, the issuance of permits will be flexible: issue them widely when prices fall and suspend them when prices rise, while the selling price must absolutely not exceed the limit of August 19th. (2) To prevent yarn and cloth from evading export, hoarding and speculation in the local area, and flowing into bandit areas, the local merchant should issue a purchase certificate, and the local trade association should stamp it to prove its validity before a transport certificate can be obtained. (3) Member who obtains certificate must provide a guarantee from the industry association, and each certificate is limited to one transport. The date of return will be determined based on the distance of the area. If there is any violation of the law, the guarantor shall be jointly responsible.

Price Limits Are Determined One After Another, General Trend Tends to Stabilize

Regarding yarn and cloth, fine yarn such as Blue Phoenix still has no market. 21-count Double Horse yarn fell from 777 yuan on Monday to 750 yuan on Tuesday, but rebounded to 783 yuan on Thursday due to the stimulus of export permits, and fell back to 770 yuan at the weekend. Leading fine cloth also rose from a low price of 26.5 yuan on Monday to 28.4 yuan on Thursday, and returned to 27.5 yuan at the weekend.

As grain prices are stable in the producing areas and supply and demand are normal, price fluctuations are minimal. The price of white *japonica* rice on the northern and southern markets rose slightly by one jiao each on Thursday, amounting to 20.6 yuan and 20.8 yuan respectively. The highest unified standard for the selling price of edible rice converted into Gold Yuan has been determined by the Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with the People's Food Allocation Office and the Rice Merchants' Association: 23.5 yuan per *shi* for special *japonica*, 22.5 yuan for first-grade *japonica*, 22 yuan for second-grade *japonica*, and 20.5 yuan for third-grade *japonica*.

Edible oil is trending downward, while flour prices have risen slightly due to higher price limits. According to the price limits, the highest price for each bag of second-grade flour from the No. 1 Flour Mill should not exceed 7 yuan and 16.2 fen, and the retail price should not exceed 7 yuan and 81 jiao.

In terms of daily necessities, soap, matches, etc., once declined but rebounded at the weekend. High-end cigarettes such as White Tin Package and San Pao Tai still have few transactions.

Sugar sales are relatively smooth due to the autumn season, and prices have turned firm. For example, No. 24 raw sugar stood at 281.8 yuan on Thursday.

Friday was the Mid-Autumn Festival. Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, silk, satin, rice, flour, miscellaneous grains, and edible oil were all closed for one day.

Sales of State-Owned Enterprises Are Sluggish and Stagnant

Regarding the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, a total of 486,000 yuan of various stocks were sold on Monday, 404,400 yuan on Tuesday, 252,300 yuan on Wednesday, 251,500 yuan on Thursday, 60,000 yuan on Friday, and 15,400 yuan on the weekend. A total of 1,469,600 yuan was sold in six days. Combined with the total sales of 3,545,900 yuan in the previous week, the sales situation of state-owned enterprise stocks is so stagnant, which is unexpected. This small amount accounts for only a drop in the ocean of floating capital in the market, and it is far from the target of selling a total of 564 million yuan, and the reason for this is worth exploring by the authorities. In addition, there are rumors that short-term treasury bonds will be re-issued soon to absorb floating capital.

The President Advocates Promoting Diligent and Frugal Nation-Building Movement

The authorities are making every effort to promote the thrift movement. The Executive Yuan's administrative meeting previously passed the establishment of a thrift guidance committee and drafted "Measures to Save Gasoline and Reduce Vehicles," which this publication has reported on. Last week, the President, in his capacity as a citizen, advocated the Diligent and Frugal Nation-Building Movement and issued ten covenants as standards for implementation.

As for the items to be practiced, they are now determined as: A, Regarding the promotion of diligence: (1) Self-reliance and self-help. (2) Punctuality. (3) Promote the National Health Movement. (4) Guide young people to study diligently and create nation-building cadres. (5) Assist refugees in employment and develop production work. (6) Promote total war and implement total mobilization. B, Regarding strict thrift: (1) Conserve the use of public property and gasoline consumption. (2) Conserve the use of manpower. (3) Conserve food and beverage consumption. (4) Conserve celebration and condolence entertainment. (5) Promote savings and conserve the use of foreign currency. (6) Conserve urban water and electricity. (7) Eliminate improper entertainment. (8) Develop diversified production and consumption cooperative enterprises to achieve the goals of material adjustment and rational distribution. Regarding the ban on the import of luxury goods, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has drafted "Measures to Ban the Sale of Imported Luxury Goods," which will be implemented after being submitted to and approved by the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting.

### Currency and Finance: Money Supply Remains Loose During the Autumn Festival

Last week, Friday coincided with the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival. As a rule, around the holidays, old debts are settled, and the market needs more funds, which can tighten the money supply. However, during this first holiday after the currency reform, due to scarce market transactions and few demand orders, the supply of funds was abundant, and the money supply was as loose as before. According to the current situation, after the national banks and bureaus turned from selling to buying, the exchange result last week was surprisingly a large net outflow. The reasons for this are still nothing more than: (1) The result of the banks and bureaus purchasing large quantities of flour and foreign exchange settlement certificates, causing funds to continue to flow out; (2) Many remittances from other areas have been settled in recent days; (3) The exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency has increased; (4) There is no release of goods, and there is no way to recover floating capital. Although the supply of funds is very abundant, the demanders are extremely scarce. It is estimated that the total amount of floating capital in this city has reached 200 to 300 million yuan, and the phenomenon of flooding is obvious.

It was originally expected that the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks this time could absorb a considerable portion of the floating capital, but from the 11th to the 17th, the total sales of stocks of five units, including China Textile, were more than 3,468,000 yuan, which is only 1% of the total floating capital in this city. Compared with the original target of selling more than 500 million US dollars of state-owned enterprises, it is even more distant. The total number of sales in a week is so small, and the number of sales per day shows a decreasing trend. According to reports, a large portion of the more than 3 million yuan in stock subscriptions includes funds from foreign merchants. From this, it is not difficult to see that if the current situation cannot be improved, even if state-owned enterprises are sold, it will still not open a way out for the depressed floating capital. How to prevent the flooding money supply from affecting prices is indeed the most noteworthy issue at present.

Demand Orders Are Scarce

Unofficial interest rates are showing a downward trend due to the loose money supply. Generally speaking, unofficial interest rates fluctuate between 7.5 and 9%, of which, although it once rose to more than 15% on Monday due to some gang's absorption, and also briefly saw a high of 15% on Thursday due to the management authorities announcing the measures for applying for permits to carry goods out of the country, it ultimately depreciated due to the ample supply of funds. Last week, the discount rate on currency also did only 2-3 yuan for day-to-day lending due to sluggish transactions and scarce demand orders. Although it once rose to 4-5 yuan on Monday and Thursday, it was very short-lived.

National Banks and Bureaus Have Large Net Outflows, Foreign Merchants Increase Net Inflows

The exchange results of national banks and bureaus showed a continuous net outflow from Monday to Friday, with a total net outflow of more than 9,399,700 Gold Yuan in five days, an increase of more than 10,400,000 yuan compared to the same period last week, which is the main source of funds for the market.

From Monday to Friday, foreign banks had a total net inflow of 2,236,645 yuan, an increase of more than 1,657,000 yuan compared to the same period last week. It is said that a major part of this is the income from the sale of foreign exchange settlement certificates by foreign banks.

Commercial banks and firms had an unusually abundant money supply last week, and orders accumulated. Interbank lending was not done at all. According to banking circles, deposits have increased fivefold or sixfold since the currency reform, but the lending business not only has not increased in any way, but has instead shown a downward trend. The loose money supply of banks and firms is mainly due to this reason. From Monday to Friday, the exchange results of banks and firms before No. 60 showed a total net inflow of 1,558,000 yuan. Although 200,000 yuan of net inflow from the Bank of Taiwan in five days was deducted, the indirect exchange between commercial banks and firms still showed a net inflow of 1,358,000 yuan, an increase of more than 7,681,000 yuan compared to the same period last week. From this, it is not difficult to see the general looseness of the money supply in the market.

The Exchange Rate in South China Has Stabilized

Last week, the domestic exchange rate in this city was generally lower than the previous week. The exchange rates in Guangzhou and Xiamen in South China were stable at 24 yuan. The exchange rate in Hankou was 25 yuan at the end of the previous week, but it fell to 15 yuan on Monday and rebounded by 1 yuan to 16 yuan from Wednesday. There were no changes on Thursday and Friday.

The exchange rate in Chongqing was 20 yuan at the end of the previous week, but it fell to 10 yuan on Monday of this week. However, it began to rebound to 16 yuan from Wednesday and rose again to 20 yuan on Thursday, returning to the level of the end of the previous week, which is likely related to the trend of capital flow.

The exchange rate in Tianjin was 10 yuan at the end of the previous week, but it fell to 5 yuan once on Monday and Tuesday of this week and rebounded to 10 yuan on Wednesday.

Regarding foreign exchange quotations, the price of gold in Hong Kong was 296.5 yuan per tael on Monday, rose once to 298 yuan on Wednesday, and fell back to the original price on Monday on Thursday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was the highest on Wednesday at 5.19 yuan, and the lowest price on Monday was 5.13 yuan. It rebounded slightly on Thursday to 5.17 yuan.

Although the price of jewelry gold in this city remains the same, the industry has reduced the amount of exchangeable gold again from 1 Qian to 5 Fen due to the depletion of the source, so the business is extremely sluggish.

### New Difficulties in Import and Export Trade

Lei Fengxing Under the wave of centralized foreign exchange, the import quotas for the seventh and eighth quarters were finally passed by the Executive Yuan's meeting last week and announced, totaling 42,141,000 US dollars, which is more than a quarter less than the quota for the fifth and sixth quarters. According to the Import Control Committee, the supply of major materials should not be lacking due to the reduction of import quotas because of the arrival of US aid materials and overseas Chinese capital. Indeed, the impact of this reduction in import quotas may be mitigated by the arrival of US aid materials, but the current import and export trade is still in a recession.

First of all, in terms of imports, it is said that it has entered a state of stagnation due to cost factors. The cost of importing from foreign countries is 10% to 20% higher than the local market price, and as high as 20% or more for steel. Goods that used to have high profits from imports, such as soda ash and saccharin, now require capital for imports, so importers have recently stopped ordering from foreign countries. According to importers, it is difficult to predict whether this phenomenon can be improved in the short term.

Secondly, regarding export trade, according to the United Credit Information Agency: there are also many difficulties at present: (1) After the currency reform, prices in producing areas continue to rise and there is a phenomenon of panic buying, so that the domestic prices of many export goods exceed foreign prices. For example, the foreign price of Sichuan ramie is more than 300 US dollars per dan, while the domestic price is more than 1300 Gold Yuan. The foreign price of tung oil is also similar to that in China. The selling price of crude tea produced in PingShui is 80 yuan per dan, but the selling price of boxed tea after processing from crude tea in PingShui in this city is only 100 yuan. Compared with the prices in the producing areas and the market prices in this city, plus freight, the difference is too much. Therefore, exporters are unwilling to purchase goods from the producing areas. The current exports are all goods that have been hoarded by merchants in the past, and they will be sold out in a short period of time.

After the implementation of the new measures, foreign import merchants are bargaining, and general prices have fallen back, with some falling by more than 10%. There is no profit to be made from exports.

In order to save the crisis in the export industry, the government has implemented limited price exports. The export industry is in a state of stagnation again under the domestic and foreign contradictions.

How to break the deadlock in the stagnant import and export trade is indeed one of the most important economic issues at present.

### Fudan Professor Xue Fen Dies En Route to England

[Central News Agency, This City] Professor Xue Fen, Director of the Department of Biology and the Marine Group at National Fudan University, recently accepted an invitation from the British Council to travel to England for research. He departed from Shanghai on September 1st but unfortunately passed away on September 10th in a Penang hospital due to a sudden illness. Xue was a native of Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, and was 44 years old. He graduated from Wuxi Normal School early in his life and continued his studies in biology at Tsinghua University, possessing profound academic knowledge. He obtained a doctorate in oceanography from the University of Liverpool in England through the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Scholarship. After returning to China during the War of Resistance, he successively served as a teaching assistant at Tsinghua University, a lecturer at Nankai University, the director of the Sichuan Provincial Hechuan Fish Farm, a specialist commissioner for the Executive Yuan, and a professor at National Fudan and Jinan Universities. He made numerous contributions to the academic world. Xue's death overseas is a significant loss to the academic community. Xue dedicated himself to scholarly pursuits but was not skilled in managing finances. He left behind five young children, the eldest being only in their teens.

### Gansu-Qinghai Archaeological Team Proves Painted Pottery Culture Spread from East to West

Three Years of Famine in Hexi Corridor Causes Widespread Suffering

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th] The Gansu-Qinghai Archaeological Team, led by Pei Wenzhong, has completed its investigation of the central and western Gansu and the Hexi Corridor, and has reached the preliminary conclusion that painted pottery culture spread from east to west. According to Jia Lanpo, who accompanied Pei on the work, the team has been excavating dinosaurs along the Gansu-Qinghai highway from Lanzhou to Xiangtang in Qinghai since the 10th. If financial resources permit, Liu Dongsheng and Mi Heng will be left to continue excavation, and Pei will go to the Machangyan in the east to study whether the "Machang Period" culture, as named by Anderson, is later than the "Yangshao Period". He will also take the opportunity to visit Dulan, where no archaeologist has yet set foot, and return to Beiping in early October. The team departed from Lanzhou on June 28th and went to the Hexi Corridor, first to Wuwei, Minqin, and Shajingzi, which Anderson named the "Shajing Period," obtaining abundant microliths, iron bricks, gold earrings, and painted pottery. Between Zhangye and Linze, microliths are already rare. Further west, through Jiuquan, Yumen, Anxi, Dunhuang, Nanhua, and other places, there is no painted pottery. Therefore, it is proven that the painted pottery culture spread from east to west. The Hexi Corridor has suffered three years of famine, and the people's lives are extremely difficult. Girls aged twelve or thirteen have no pants to wear. The population of Yongchang was 120,000 at the end of the Qing Dynasty, but now it is less than 45,000, but there is no shortage of the very wealthy.

### On "Using One's Brain"

— Wang Kao

In Shanghai, those who don't know how to "use their brains" are fools; those who know how to "use their brains" diligently are scoundrels, or even targets of the Economic Control Commission. Therefore, Shanghai is really a society composed of a mixture of scoundrels and fools. Fools have always been exploited by scoundrels; but from now on, I hope the scoundrels will also taste some of the bitterness. Although the fools don't want to turn over and enslave others, at least they can vent some of their resentment.

The brain is meant to be used every day. Unless someone is dead, it won't stop moving. — In Nanjing, I met a geomancer who had a wonderful theory: even after death, the brain still moves, which is what is called the wireless electricity effect, so some people dream of ghosts and have omens of good or bad. I dare not say whether this matter has a scientific basis, but it can also be taken as an example of constant movement? — But this kind of movement is within the orbit, such as working and eating, spending money and buying things. It is normal and, rather than being human reason, it is more like instinct.

However, what Shanghainese call "using one's brain" definitely does not refer to this (almost not working but eating, not spending money but buying things), and if anyone interprets the term "using one's brain" in this way, they will be ridiculed by the wise. The world is truly difficult to say. I never thought that the principles and ideas that are commonly applied in other places would be completely incompatible in a metropolis. Mozi once said, "Now there is a man who says black is black when he sees a little black, and says black is white when he sees a lot of black, then this man must not know the difference between black and white." It seems that such topsy-turvy things existed as far back as three thousand years ago. Who says Chinese culture is not long-standing?

However, most people in the world are indeed ignorant. Taking black and white as an example, Su Dongpo's snow poem says, "The light shakes the silver sea, dazzlingly producing flowers," which is clearly a white scene, so why is it dazzling and producing flowers? There is no other reason than the word "dazzling" itself, which makes people dizzy. Therefore, "Unable to recognize the true face of Mount Lu, only because one is in the mountain itself" is also because the peaks and ridges so close at hand are indistinguishable, so one cannot figure out what the true face is. In Peking opera, the clean official who is only a seventh-rank official goes to interrogate the Grand Tutor, who is a first-rank official in the court. Even the yamen runners feel strange, so when Pan Hong arrives in front of the censor's gate, he sighs, "The small censor's yamen also has some menacing aura"! This shows that in ordinary times, they never feel that there is any censor's yamen in existence, and the censor officials, in addition to flattering the Grand Tutor, also dare not pursue his crimes. Big shops bully customers, which creates the phenomenon of people giving a thumbs up to a certain idol. When it comes to this point, not only does no one dare to say that his crimes are monstrous, but they envy his good fortune as vast as the East Sea.

Daring not to face reality is also to protect oneself wisely, which is also a lack of a sense of justice. Furthermore, it becomes recognizing reality, putting makeup on reality, and even flattering reality and kneeling to reality. Deviation must intensify, and there are no exceptions in the world. Some people say that although Chinese tradition is benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and filial piety, it is all said from a self-serving standpoint. Although the statement is extreme, the meaning is not without merit. At least in a place like Shanghai, no matter how bright the neon signs on the top of the International Hotel are, they are just a huge irony.

It is said that 75% of the disruptive forces in the country are in the Bund, and I am afraid that 75% of the integrity has also been lost in this place. Especially after ten years of war, human psychology, moral standards, and concepts of right and wrong have almost all been overturned. This currency reform is a superficial work. We hope that what follows must be even more psychological recovery and psychological revolution. If one still thinks that sooner or later it will still be the world of "using one's brain," I guarantee that nothing will be achieved. Recently, because this road is blocked everywhere, I often hear friends who "use their brains" scratching their heads and complaining, and even more meticulously and cunningly using their brains. My hope is "Sir, stop!" When a comet encounters another planet, it will shatter itself!

### The Harm of Drinking Too Much Water

— Nan Wu

Most people think that drinking a little more water is not a big deal, but it is not. Not long ago, a twelve-year-old girl in New Jersey, USA, died from drinking too much water. This child was playing with her friends and drank three "quarts" of water (each quart is equal to one-quarter of a gallon) in twenty minutes, and died twelve hours later. Because her blood vessels absorbed too much water, her lungs were full of water, and all the symptoms were exactly the same as drowning.

### Brief Jottings

— Yao Yuanchu

Gazing at the clear lake, autumn turns to spring again,
Hungry, I come seeking food, hesitant to sit among them.
My friend is a Zen Buddhist,
I, though unable to drink, can be near those who do;
Plum and willow should not concern themselves with worldly affairs,
Lofty pavilions fear harming natural innocence,
If this journey encounters wind and rain,
It will be the river dragon cleansing the dust.

### Sitting in the Rain Until Dusk on the Seventh Day of the Ninth Month

The typhoon comes from the north, heralded by rain,
Sprinkling idle windows, whispering autumn words.
The gurgling continues all day without ceasing,
A pure coolness pressing against light summer clothes.
Listening to the rain, listening to the wind, I feel autumn even more,
The Songjiang and Huangpu Rivers beat against the sky.
To float a whole family in a small boat is rare,
I liken it to Sima Guang's boat on the shore.

### Understanding Smile

— Shi Yu

Reading the works of famous writers often makes me pound the table for no reason, gently caressing the page that makes me forget myself, and smile knowingly. In such smiles, I get a moment of inspiration; an unspeakable pleasure. It seems as if at that moment, I am in complete communion with the author's soul. A decade ago, reading Romain Rolland's "Jean-Christophe," I smiled brightly, unable to control myself. His description of Jean-Christophe as a child is so vivid, and the psychological portrayal is so profound that it inspires people:

"...He invented tying a broken rope to a stick and throwing it into the river in a serious manner, waiting for the fish to bite. He knew that the fish would not bite the rope without a hook or bait, but he thought that maybe it would break the rule for his sake. His confidence would never end. He even used a whip to fish in the cracks of the stone slabs in the sewers on the street. He would pull up the whip from time to time, very moved, thinking that this time it was heavier and he was going to pull up some treasure that his grandfather often talked about in stories..."

Reading the above paragraph, I think anyone will smile knowingly. Because almost everyone has fished in the cracks of the stone slabs in the sewers like that. I remember when I was a child, every night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I would secretly peek at the full moon, my heart beating nervously, wondering if the dragon boat that my grandmother talked about would appear. I knew that no one had really seen a dragon boat in the moon, but I thought that maybe it would break the rule for my sake. My hometown of Nanxun is said to be a blessed town because it has been spared from the ravages of war throughout the ages. Therefore, when the Anti-Japanese War broke out, when the neighboring towns were engulfed in flames, people were still thinking that maybe it would break the rule for the sake of "Nanxun." (Note: Half the town has become rubble.) In the Middle Ages, Europeans often argued about "how many angels can stand on a pin," turning red in the face. Some said three, some said four, and some said a dozen. And each one gave a full roll of reasons like a doctoral thesis. Because Europeans at that time mostly "believed" that angels could indeed stand on the head of a needle. I think we live in "ideals," and even the smartest people have to fish in the cracks of the stone slabs a few times, right?

Reading Gogol's "Dead Souls," the author describes the Manilov couple:

"...Also, for some reason, he put down his pipe, and she put down her work, and they had a long, long, soul-stirring kiss, long enough to smoke a small cigar..."

Such a portrayal of the Manilov couple's love, but a few words. But young people who read it are enough to cause a knowing smile. I think middle-aged people who read it may smile even more meaningfully.

Since the promulgation of the new currency system, economists, financial and fiscal experts from various schools in the old capital have published lengthy articles with their opinions every day, most of which are well-organized and comprehensive, and there is no need to comment on the rights and wrongs here. But let's briefly record the general living conditions and the self-plans of the salaried class, based on what we have seen and heard.

For public educators and the general salaried class, real life is the most pressing concern at present, and it is human nature to care about the details and calculate carefully. At first, when I heard that the index method was abolished and new currency notes were issued, I couldn't help but rejoice in unison. (The newspaper also said "Civil servants are better off!") Because if a person with an original salary of one hundred yuan calculates the current index, multiples, and subsidies together, it is only about one hundred million legal tender, while one hundred yuan in new currency is three hundred million (because the new regulations stipulate that one yuan in new notes is equal to three million legal tender), a sudden increase of three times, so I was overjoyed when I first heard about it.

Then I saw the detailed items, mentioning that under the public education item, those with a basic salary of "forty" or less would be paid in full with new notes, those with a salary of over forty to three hundred would be given two-tenths, and those with a salary of over three hundred would be given one-tenth. In this way, a person with a salary of one hundred yuan can get fifty-two, which is about two-fifths of the original salary. A person with two hundred yuan can get seventy-two, which is close to three-fifths. A person with three hundred yuan can get ninety-two, which is not enough three-fifths. A person with four hundred yuan can get one hundred and two, which is one-quarter. A person with five hundred yuan can get one hundred and twelve, which is close to one-fifth. A person with six hundred yuan can get one hundred and twenty-two, which is less than one-fifth! So the smile suddenly stopped and turned into hesitation, uneasy.

A teacher congratulated a tax bureau staff member, saying that since the agency he served was collecting money according to the pre-war standard, his salary must also be paid in full, so they were still benefiting. But the tax official said that although the agency said it would collect the full amount, the salaries of the money collection staff might be discounted in the same way as other public educators, so they had to wait for further news before there was a special possibility of "congratulating" them.

### Records of Slaying Tigers and Eradicating Flies

— Song Xian

Li Guangdian's Diary of Defending Bian in the Ming Dynasty contains several records of profiteers hoarding goods. The diary entry for June 5th of the fourteenth year of Chongzhen reads: "The blind tiger named Yu Chun, opened a hoarding household, and was able to obtain imperial permission to trade. Since April 28th, he has been closing his door, with one tael of silver buying four sheng of wheat. Yu Chun secretly ordered the price to be raised to two dou per tael. Investigating Officer Dong personally went to Nanfang to arrest Yu Chun and beheaded him in the market. Yu Chun said before his execution: 'I have eight hundred shi of wheat and I am willing to redeem my life.' Huang shouted: 'I don't want your wheat, I only want your life.' So he beheaded him, and the price of wheat remained the same."

Also, the History of the Five Dynasties records the story of Zhang Guaiya: "Zhang Guaiya was the magistrate of Chongyang. A clerk came out of the treasury, and he saw a coin under his temple. He questioned him, and it was the money in the treasury. Guaiya ordered him to be beaten with a stick. The clerk was furious and said: 'One coin is not worth mentioning, why are you beating me! You can beat me, but you can't kill me!' Guaiya raised his pen and judged: 'One coin a day, a thousand coins in a thousand days. A rope saws through wood, water drips and wears through stone.' So he drew his sword, stepped down the stairs, and beheaded him.

Now there are fly tigers, also entering cages, slaying tigers and eradicating flies, let us watch the chivalry.

### Talking About Crickets Again

Time flies quickly, White Dew has just passed, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is over. It is the season for fighting crickets. Humans capture and raise crickets, drive them to fight and bite each other, and kill each other, and then take it as a laughing stock or use it as a gambling tool. For crickets, which have a warrior-like posture and spirit, their fate is truly sad. Some say that the fighting spirit of crickets is their innate nature, the so-called "inheriting the qi of heaven and earth and responding to robbery", so they have to kill each other, and the entanglement never ends. This statement is a bit mysterious. A more scientific explanation is that crickets fight in order to compete for the opposite sex. Initially, when male and female crickets are in the same cave and other male crickets invade, the male cricket in the cave will fight at all costs. Over time, it becomes a habit, and whenever two males meet, they will have a contest. It is said that crickets are particularly brave after mating. Players have the saying "Store females before raising generals". According to this statement, crickets are like humans, and many are victims of love.

Three markets

Regardless of the real reason for the crickets' fighting spirit, due to the performance of this fighting fact, crickets have become playthings for adults and children. Shanghai, as a big city, does not produce crickets itself, but every year at this season, many foreign gangs purchase a large number of crickets from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jiangbei and other places and transport them to Shanghai. In the suburbs such as Longhua and Pudong, some people also specialize in catching crickets at night and bring them to Shanghai to sell in the morning. These days, the cricket markets near the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road, the Yimiao Market on Lianyun Road, and the City God Temple in Nanshi have once again seen the annual boom. In addition to small shops specializing in insects, fish, flowers, and birds being the main camps for crickets, there are also countless small stalls with simple equipment, a soap box with a dozen or twenty large and small earthenware pots on it, and a pile of bamboo tubes on the ground. Depending on the quality of their breed, some crickets are pampered and stroll in earthenware pots, while others are cramped and confined in bamboo tubes. The worst are those kept in a bamboo basket with a handful of withered grass in the middle. Hundreds of crickets live together in this dilapidated house, and they have to crawl on the walls.

Price per head

The endless stream of people buying and watching crickets has created an unprecedented bustle in these three markets. Every stall is crowded with dark crowds. Ordinary crickets in bamboo baskets or bamboo tubes sell for 50,000 or 100,000 yuan each, while "falling pot goods" in earthenware pots do not have a fixed standard. The stall owners bargain from a few cents or a few yuan to ten yuan or even twenty or thirty yuan in gold yuan notes. This depends on the strength of the cricket itself and whether the buyer is a connoisseur.

Eight-character secret

According to connoisseurs, the quality of crickets is truly complex and can be written into a thick book. Simply put: The head of a cricket should not be shallow and flat, the face should be square, and the color should be black like the bottom of a pot. The opening of the teeth and pliers should not be too large, only a line is appropriate. The neck should be wide, the legs should be thick, round, and long, and the tibias should be old in color, such as mottled white and waxy yellow. The wings should be short, thin, and have many wrinkles. The body should have delicate skin, pure color, broad back, and thick flesh. The color should be green first, yellow second, red second, black again, and white as the lowest grade. It is extremely rare to combine purple and yellow, so those with purple and yellow and an oily color are rare treasures among crickets. In addition, there is also the so-called eight-character secret of "dry, old, fine, glutinous, high, square, smooth, and thick", but this kind of identification method is easy to explain in words, but in application, without many years of experience, it is just "paper talk" and is still useless.

Difficult to Reproduce the Grand Occasion

It is said that the custom of fighting crickets originated in the Song and Ming dynasties. It first prevailed in the palace and gradually spread among the people. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai had public cricket gambling arenas, and a single win or loss often amounted to hundreds of yuan. These places that indulge in playing with things and lose one's ambition are now prohibited. Although private cricket fighting meetings are still often held, the grand occasion is difficult to reproduce after all, and today is not what it used to be. Sincerely, Wen Zhong
