### Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech: Future Government Measures Must Adhere to the Constitution to Achieve the Goals of "Of the People, By the People, and For the People"

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The full text of Chairman Chiang's speech at the closing ceremony of the National Assembly on the 1st is as follows: Mr. Chairman, Representatives:

This assembly is the first session of the first National Assembly of the Republic of China to implement constitutional government. It bears the mission of initiating constitutional rule and comes at the most difficult time of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. Its significance and responsibility are extremely important. All of you representatives, entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the people of the country, have attended the meetings for a month, studying and deliberating diligently, and exerting yourselves to the utmost. As the meeting concludes and successfully closes, I, Chiang Kai-shek, on behalf of the National Government, extend my sincere appreciation to all of you.

Before the implementation of the constitution, our central government was the National Government, which transitioned from political tutelage to constitutional government. From today onward, the central government is a government established in accordance with the constitution, that is, the constitutional government that the general revolutionaries and patriots who followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership for fifty years have strived to achieve through bloodshed and sacrifice for the country, for the people, and for the Three Principles of the People. In the future, all government measures must abide by the constitution, so as to give full play to the government's ability to govern as endowed by the constitution, and to achieve the greatest goals of being "of the people, by the people, and for the people." This assembly is truly the source of the lawful establishment of a democratic constitutional government. In the future, it will bear the lofty task of exercising political power, carrying on the past and opening up the future, and is truly an epoch-making initiative in history.

Among the representatives, many have participated in the National Assembly that drafted the constitution. All of you are clear about the process of drafting this constitution. The effectiveness of implementing the constitution in the future depends entirely on the unity of the country, the people and the government, giving full play to their respective powers and abilities. It is especially important that everyone abide by the constitution in order to realize the spirit of democracy and thoroughly implement the effectiveness of the rule of law.

This assembly opened on March 29th and closes today, lasting a full month. During the meeting, the whole country placed ardent hopes on it. All of you representatives, elected and entrusted by the people of the country, gathered in the capital. During this month, you have constantly kept in mind the heavy responsibility entrusted to you by the people of the country, acted cautiously, and remained tireless in order to complete this major mission. This spirit is worthy of everyone's admiration.

In this assembly, the representatives' proposals totaled several hundred, fully expressing the earnest expectations of compatriots from all over the country for national welfare and people's livelihood. At the same time, they are also the loyal contributions of all of you representatives regarding the country and the nation. I believe that the new government will respect public opinion and adopt as many of these proposals as possible.

Since I devoted myself to the revolution, I have exhausted my knowledge and ability to overcome all difficulties in order to fulfill the consistent goal of unifying and building the nation. However, looking back on forty years of efforts, I still have not realized Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and relieved the suffering of my compatriots, which I deeply regret. This time, the establishment of a constitutional government has again been entrusted to me with heavy responsibilities. I can only be more vigilant and diligent, upholding the past spirit of serving the country and the people, and dedicating myself to the realization of democratic constitutionalism and the Three Principles of the People. I respectfully convey this to all of you representatives, and ask you to convey it to the elders and compatriots throughout the country, so that we can be of one heart and one mind, encourage and support each other, and create a bright future for the Republic of China. I wish you all good health and wish the assembly success.

### Zhang Zhiben and Others Plan to Form a Constitutional Amendment Research Association

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] National representatives Zhang Zhiben, Lin Bin, Shi Shangkuan, and others, in preparation for convening a provisional assembly in the future to exercise the power to amend the constitution, have decided to form a "Constitutional Amendment Research Association."

The main points of the association's organization are: A, The sole purpose is to study how to amend the constitution, named the Constitutional Amendment Research Association; B, National representatives may all become members; C, For the purpose of joint research, members may hold symposiums at any time; D, Members' opinions on amending the constitution must be accompanied by detailed reasons and sent to the Nanjing Liaison Office together with relevant information; E, The association must, based on its research results, draft a constitutional amendment draft three months before the opening of the provisional assembly, as preparation for proposing the amendment in accordance with the law at that time.

The association's declaration put forward the slogans of "Comprehensive Reform" and "Peaceful Reform," and advocated supporting the national policy of suppressing rebellion and building the nation under the national interest and constitutional principles, and demanded that the rights of the people in the constitution be effectively guaranteed.

### Yu Youren's Closing Remarks

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The full text of Yu Youren's closing remarks is as follows:

After sixteen sessions, our representatives have concluded the first session of the First National Assembly. I, Youren, on behalf of the Presidium, express my congratulations on the completion of the mission of this session of the Assembly, and at the same time express my gratitude to all the representatives and internal and external staff of the Secretariat for their hard work over these thirty-four days.

From the time the National Government convened the National Assembly to enact the constitution in December of the thirty-fifth year to the convening of the first session of the constitutional National Assembly, only one year and four months have passed. Within this short period, the National Government has formulated ten regulations, conducted various elections, completed the process of returning power to the people, and made thorough preparations before the opening of this session of the Assembly, providing sincere hospitality during the proceedings. On behalf of this session of the Assembly, I express my admiration to the National Government. We especially admire Chairman Chiang of the National Government, who has fought for revolution and resistance against aggression for twenty years, with the aim of implementing democratic constitutionalism. In the past three years, he has overcome numerous obstacles to enable the successive holding of the two National Assemblies for constitution-making and constitutional rule, making a brilliant contribution to the success of democratic constitutionalism. This is what we should especially state today.

This session of the Assembly is convened in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China. The powers of the Assembly, according to Article 27 of the Constitution, are to elect the President and Vice President and to amend the Constitution. However, this session of the Assembly is the first session of constitutional rule, and its mission is to complete the organization of the elected government, to be entrusted by the people, to protect the people's freedom and rights, to implement the basic national policies stipulated in the Constitution, and to safeguard the democratic republic system and defend the country's territorial sovereignty. I deeply believe that all of our representatives in the Assembly exercising the two joint powers must feel the weight of their responsibility. Therefore, when the Assembly elected the President and Vice President, it went through careful selection, which is truly a cause for celebration for the people of the world.

After the closing of this session of the Assembly, the elected government's various departments will be established one after another, following the Constitution and exercising their powers. From now on, the Republic of China will forever be a democratic republic of the people, by the people, and for the people. This session of the Assembly, at this time of transition of power, has completed the mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future, and I believe that the representatives can take comfort in this. However, I still feel that there are two points that must be stated here:

First, the sovereignty of the Republic of China lies in the entire people. The entire people must express their opinions on politics and shoulder their responsibilities to the country, so that democratic politics can be sound and the elected government can have strength. It is hoped that after the President takes office and the five branches of government are established, the government will have new and refreshing facilities to gain the trust of the people. The people should also have the enthusiasm of unity to love the country. Only then can our Republic of China maintain its independent and equal status, safeguard the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, overcome the current crisis, and strive for a rich, strong, healthy, and happy country.

Second, the Constitution is the backbone of democratic politics. The opinions of the entire people must all follow the track of the Constitution in order to condense into the national policy, and the various positions and departments of the government should also cooperate with each other and check each other in accordance with the text and spirit of the Constitution. Only then can the country's politics progress and the country's unity be maintained. It is hoped that after the elected government is established, everything will be based on the Constitution, and especially that political party organizations will be strengthened, the habit of the rule of law will be cultivated, and politics will be put on the democratic and constitutional track.

Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated revolution, more than fifty years have passed. The Xinhai Revolution laid the initial foundation for the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition laid the foundation for the country's unification, and the War of Resistance Against Japan strived for international equality. In the successive battles, how many heads of patriots and people with lofty ideals have been thrown away, and how much blood and sweat have been shed by patriotic soldiers and civilians. Finally, this Constitution of the Republic of China has been crystallized. We can only respect this Constitution, safeguard this Constitution, use the Constitution as the highest norm, and guide politics to the democratic future, so that we will be worthy of the revolutionary martyrs, and can repay the 450 million compatriots, and can save the people who are suffering in deep waters, and can shoulder the heavy responsibility of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion and build a new China. Let us raise our arms and shout, Long live the Republic of China.

### Sun and Wu, President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Host a Banquet for All Legislators

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Legislative Yuan of the National Government declared its conclusion on the 1st. President Sun Ke and Vice President Wu Tiecheng specially hosted a banquet for all committee members and staff of the Legislative Yuan at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at noon. About 400 people attended. During the banquet, Sun said in his speech that the Legislative Yuan was established in the 16th year of the Republic of China. He himself served as the President of the Third Session in the 22nd year and was originally scheduled to complete his term in the 24th year. Later, the central government decided to implement constitutional government in the 26th year, followed by the War of Resistance Against Japan, and he has been re-elected to this day, lasting 16 years in total. Although the Legislative Yuan was not the highest legislative body in the past, it has demonstrated the true spirit of democracy and often made concrete contributions to the central government's decision-making. He hoped that this spirit of democracy would continue to be maintained after the establishment of the new Legislative Yuan. Sun continued to describe his personal life, contributing more than a quarter of his life to the Legislative Yuan, and this quarter was like his useful years. After more than ten years of learning and tempering, he felt that he was capable of this position. However, the responsibility of the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of constitutional government is even greater. Sun expressed that he had no intention of clinging to his position. He had stated that he would give up his position when running for Vice President, and his intention has not changed. He hoped that the central government could make a decision on this matter quickly. Finally, Sun expressed his concern for the incumbent legislators and staff of the Legislative Yuan, saying that 70 of the original legislators were nominated by the central government as legislative candidates, but only half of them were elected. They are all useful talents for the country, and he hoped that they would have the opportunity to serve the country effectively in the future. As for the staff, those who are young and strong can continue to serve in the new Legislative Yuan, and those who are older can retire using the Civil Servant Retirement Law if they do not wish to continue working. After Sun finished his speech, Vice President Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Wu Shangying, and Liu Guanxun, the oldest legislator, delivered speeches one after another. The banquet dispersed around 3:00 PM.

### Principles for Reorganizing Representative Bodies After Constitutional Implementation

— Zhao Fengjie

Although the Constitution has been implemented in theory, its effectiveness is actually suspended until the President is inaugurated. Therefore, the term "constitutional implementation" in this article refers to the period after the President's inauguration and the reorganization and establishment of central administrative bodies in accordance with the Constitution. Furthermore, the term "representative bodies" refers to the assemblies of provinces, cities, and counties at all levels, excluding the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan at the central level.

Currently, the assemblies of various provinces, cities, and counties, regardless of whether their members are selected through pity or elected by the people, are temporary in nature and cannot be considered formal representative bodies. After constitutional implementation, all provinces, cities, and counties must formulate local autonomy regulations at all levels in accordance with the Constitution to establish formal local assemblies. It is best for the autonomy regulations at all levels to be formulated by the formal assemblies at each level themselves and submitted to the central government for record, so as to avoid conflicts with the Constitution and central laws. County autonomy regulations can be filed with the provincial government. The principles of reorganizing formal representative bodies at all levels that we are discussing are what current representative bodies lack and can correct current malpractices. We will now reveal them as follows:

(1) Members of assemblies at all levels should be changed to salaried positions. Currently, senators of provinces, cities, and counties are only provided with transportation and meal allowances during meetings. Resident committee members are also provided with transportation and meal allowances during recesses. Non-resident members receive no compensation during recesses. In some places, there are no resident committee members during recesses, and all senators participate in various subcommittees, meeting once a week or every two weeks, without receiving transportation allowances, as is the case with the Beijing Municipal Senate. This unpaid position can certainly reduce the financial burden of local governments; however, as a result, only those with property can serve as senators. The representative system of the bourgeoisie has already lost its value. If those without property are allowed to occupy seats, then the meaning of the "翁" is not in the wine, but in seeking to flaunt and extort, or to obtain an official position by virtue of being a senator, which loses the original intention of representing the people. Otherwise, they will simply go through the motions, saying nothing of substance, or attending meetings at leisure, signing in and leaving, seeking other means of livelihood. People outside the assembly often do not understand this situation, and often hope that the senators will put in more effort, investigate the facts more, and obtain more reliable figures, so as to avoid speaking nonsense or rambling insults during meetings. This kind of request is indeed legitimate and not harsh. It should be known that this kind of undertaking is neither desired by the bourgeoisie and the leisure class, nor is it possible for those without property to do it. Neither of these two kinds of people are willing to do it, so if those with jobs are allowed to serve as senators, can they be competent? This also has its drawbacks, which will be discussed in the next section. In short, an unpaid position easily leads those who hold it to corruption. In today's world, who can serve the public on an empty stomach? Therefore, in order to ensure that senators at all levels can do their best, they must be given a certain amount of compensation.

(2) Members of assemblies at all levels shall not hold other positions concurrently. Currently, only public officials are restricted from concurrently serving as people's representatives, but salaried positions other than public officials may be held concurrently. For example, the president of a national university or the principal of a provincial middle school cannot concurrently serve as a senator of a province or city, but the principal of a private school can. This is, of course, to prevent officials from raping public opinion. In the current system in China, people's representatives exercise political power, while officials exercise administrative power, which must be clearly distinguished. However, allowing others with jobs or those with jobs to serve concurrently is nothing more than an attempt to make adjustments because senators of provinces, cities, and counties are unpaid. Little does one know that allowing those with jobs to serve concurrently means that there are few worthy people in society and many unworthy ones. They only know how to represent the interests of their same class or same　 and ignore the interests of other people. Those with inferior character only know how to represent their own personal interests and do not hesitate to harm their neighbors. Just look at the proposals and speeches of certain senators in the assembly to infer their positions and occupations. There are very few who are concerned with the overall situation and the interests of the entire people, and they are isolated and cannot reverse the declining trend. Therefore, area representatives should not be concurrently held by those with jobs, and even occupational representatives must be required to temporarily resign or leave their jobs after taking office as representatives, so that they can concentrate on their duties as representatives. We advocated earlier that senators should be salaried, and here we should advocate that they should not hold other positions concurrently. These two principles are complementary.

(3) The number of members of assemblies at all levels should be reduced as much as possible. Since we have advocated that members of assemblies at all levels should be given compensation, reducing the number of members can also proportionally reduce the burden on local governments. Furthermore, based on the current situation in the country, the people's knowledge and standards have not reached a considerable level, and their virtues are not thick enough. There are very few who can serve as people's representatives, speak out for justice, and not fear the powerful, so as to express the people's hidden feelings. Most of the mediocre ones advance and retreat with the crowd, echoing others. The stubborn and unruly only know how to use their positions to collude with the government for personal gain. The interests of the people are put aside. When the number of members is small, the worthy ones can account for a larger percentage. If the number of members is large, there will be more incompetent people, and the unworthy will account for a larger percentage. Furthermore, when discussing proposals, fewer people make it easier to focus opinions, and there is also room for discussion. If there are too many people, opinions will diverge, and the venue will be more easily manipulated and controlled by those who seek personal gain. The passage of proposals will also be more hasty and may not be appropriate. Therefore, when the formal assemblies at all levels are established in the future, the number of members should be reduced as much as possible, such as one representative from each township in the county assembly; one representative from each county in the provincial assembly; and one representative from each district in the city assembly. Under this principle, it is hoped that governments at all levels will bring out their conscience, seek talents for the country, and establish tables for the people. If, because the number of members is small, the government uses control methods to fill the positions with relatives and friends, and instead allows the worthy to be squeezed out due to the small number, then the original intention of the　 will be lost.

(4) Assemblies at all levels should maintain a balance of power with governments at the same level. After the formal assemblies at all levels are established in the future, in addition to retaining the existing powers, their relationship with governments at the same level should be given special attention. That is, if the administrative heads of governments at all levels are directly elected by the people, what position will they have in relation to the assemblies at each level? If the heads of governments at all levels cannot be elected by the people for the time being and are temporarily appointed by the higher-level government, what will be the relationship between them and the assemblies at each level? In the former case, the members of the assembly and the heads of the government are both elected by the people and are, of course, directly responsible to the people. The people can not only recall the members of the assembly, but also recall the administrative heads. Motions for recall can be initiated by more than a few tenths of the people, and a referendum can be held. However, can the administrative head request a referendum to recall the members of the assembly? And can the assembly resolve to request a referendum to recall the administrative head? All these issues are open for discussion. From the principle of checks and balances, both parties should have the right to request or resolve to dismiss the other party. If we put the principle of dividing political power and administrative power in China, the members of the assembly are representatives who exercise political power, so they can propose to dismiss the administrative head, while the administrative head is an agency that exercises administrative power, so it seems that it cannot request the people to recall the members of the assembly. In this way, the power of the assembly will be above the administrative head, which is also not appropriate. In order to ensure the balance of power between the two parties, it is proper that neither party has the right to request the dismissal of the other party in order to prevent the greatest friction between the two parties. However, after constitutional implementation, it may not be possible to identify popularly elected county magistrates and popularly elected provincial governors and mayors for a while. Administrative heads at all levels can rely on their superior positions in the higher-level government and their own to mobilize the people to recall the members of the assembly at the same level, while the assembly at the same level can only report violations or dereliction of duty by the administrative head to the supervisory agency in accordance with the current system. This also loses the checks and balances of civil rights. In order to correct deviations and remedy shortcomings, the formal assembly should be given the power to directly impeach the administrative heads at the same level. When the higher-level administrative agency receives the impeachment case, it should immediately hand over the impeached administrative official for deliberation, and those with significant integrity should be suspended from their duties.

The above principles are only discussed in general terms. As for the details and technical issues of legislation, they need to be discussed in detail by the formal Legislative Yuan in the future. We will not elaborate here.

The three characters "Presidential Office" were hung on the gate of the Presidential Office at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. The former National Government has now been changed to the Presidential Office.

### Successful and Complete Closing Ceremony of the National Assembly

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Three thousand representatives, a 34-day convention, have completed a mission unprecedented in the history of the Republic of China. Today, in the assembly hall, people come and go, exchanging farewells and promising to meet again in two and a half years. As the songs begin, the National Assembly has concluded. The assembly hall, which accommodated thousands of representatives, will remain lonely in the capital. This magnificent building of historical significance will forever be etched in people's memories.

Today, starting from leaving the assembly hall, constitutional governance has taken shape, and a new government of democratic politics is about to be established. The wheels of time have relegated the period of political tutelage to the records of history.

Today, in terms of time, it is the very first day of implementing daylight saving time. Starting one hour earlier from today, from the representatives to the presidium, to the secretariat of the assembly, everyone is busy with the most solemn event before the closing ceremony—presenting the certificates of election to the President and Vice President. The Secretary-General barely slept all night, and the planning of affairs, such as the transcription of the election certificates, meant that Secretary Ye, who had once single-handedly written a constitution, had another night of work. Furthermore, the charter of the eighty-five members of the presidium meant that the secretariat had to work through the night. Once everything was ready, Mr. Zhou Zhongyue and Mr. Yu Bin, fully dressed in their long gowns and mandarin jackets, the Secretary-General was able to carry the solemn certificates and proceed to the official residences of the President and Vice President. The presentation of the certificate to the President was without ceremony. The entire process took only three minutes. Starting today, the head of state has, for the first time, obtained the qualifications to govern the people from the hands of the people. It can also be said that, starting today, the head of state is truly a public servant of the people, entrusted by the people to administer state affairs. The President put it well: "I will certainly serve the country in accordance with the public will." This is the first response of the head of state to accepting the trust of the people. This time was from 9:40 to 9:43 AM on May 1, the 37th year of the Republic of China.

The closing ceremony of the assembly began at 10:35 AM. When Secretary-General Hong Lanyou announced that Mr. Yu Youren would serve as chairman, the lights in the assembly hall were bright, and the white-bearded Mr. Yu slowly walked towards the chairman's seat, bathed in the light. The entire hall erupted in applause. Then, Chairman Chiang entered from the side door at 10:39 AM, and the entire hall responded with enthusiastic applause. After the formalities were completed, Mr. Yu and Chairman Chiang delivered speeches one after the other. The audience listened quietly. When Chairman Chiang spoke last about "creating a bright future for the Republic of China," the representatives seemed to shoulder a heavy responsibility, looking forward to the brightness of the future. When the ceremony was declared complete at 10:55 AM, Chairman Chiang and Mr. Yu repeatedly yielded precedence as they stepped down from the chairman's seat. The three shouts of "Long live the Republic of China" further enhanced the grandeur of the assembly's closing ceremony.

After the 20-minute closing ceremony ended, the representatives left the assembly hall one after another. The vermilion doors of more than a dozen entrances and exits saw off the three thousand representatives. The lights gradually dimmed, and the doors slowly closed. Outside, there were still commemorative photos being taken and signatures being inscribed on calligraphy pieces requested as souvenirs. After the representatives and assembly reporters received their commemorative badges, they began registering with the transportation group and said goodbye to each other.

The achievements of the assembly are praiseworthy. Regardless of party affiliation, whether Chinese or foreign, their views on the Shanghai assembly were uniformly satisfactory. Because of the large number of people, the limited time, and the small venue, it was not appropriate to prevent people from speaking, nor could the duration be extended. The narrow assembly hall could not cultivate people's emotions. Therefore, although there were several near-disruptive incidents during the thirty-four days, in the end, everything was completed successfully. Everything that needed to be done was done, and the mission was accomplished. Moreover, we are only in a preliminary experiment. To exaggerate, this achievement has already shown the brilliance of the future of democratic politics, proving that the experiment is a success!

### US Congress Will Conduct Specific Research to Strengthen UN Organs: Amending the Charter to Reduce Veto Power; House Foreign Affairs Committee Invites Austin and Marshall to Testify

[United Press, Washington, 30th] Reports circulated that President Truman would submit a special message to Congress seeking permission to lease military equipment to the sixteen Western European countries participating in the Marshall Plan. However, White House Secretary Ross has firmly denied this. (See yesterday's newspaper). This denial by the White House has temporarily cast a shadow over discussions within the government regarding strengthening Western European military capabilities. However, according to well-informed sources, two unrelated policies are indeed under consideration, but they have not yet reached the stage of being formally submitted to the White House for consideration or a final decision by the President. One policy stipulates temporary preliminary measures, whereby President Truman would temporarily lease guns, airplanes, and other military equipment to any of the sixteen Western European countries. The other policy is to have Congress pass a bill to strengthen UN organs.

[US Information Service, Washington, 30th] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton stated today that his group will begin a systematic study of UN organs next Tuesday. At least seven days will be needed to hear opinions from all sides before beginning discussions on the relationship between the Palestine issue and the UN and the United States. Eaton stated that the United States must decide whether to sit idly by while the Soviet Union freezes the UN, or to find ways to amend the Charter. He cited the Soviet Union's use of the veto power as many as twenty-two times to obstruct actions passed by the Security Council by a majority. The first witness to testify on Tuesday will be US Representative to the UN Austin. Secretary of State Marshall may attend on Wednesday.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] House Foreign Affairs Committee member Monte stated today that the non-communist world possesses 70% to 90% of the critical factors necessary for victory in war. This economic advantage of free countries will be a powerful element for lasting peace. If peace-loving regions around the world jointly utilize their resources in an effective manner of international action, then no belligerent nation or totalitarian aggressor will be willing to embark on communist-style adventures. This so-called effective manner is to amend the UN Charter. A proposal to amend the UN Charter to drastically reduce the veto power of major powers will soon be submitted to Congress. Monte is one of the proposers.

### US Drafting Plan for Military Aid to Western Europe

[United Press International, Washington, 30th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democratic Leader Connally confirmed on the 30th that the US government is drafting a plan for military aid to Western Europe. He stated that the government is expected to submit a bill to Congress next week, requesting authorization for the government to ship arms to Europe. This move will give President Truman the authority to provide tanks, airplanes, firearms, and other military equipment to any of the sixteen Marshall Plan countries to protect America's massive reconstruction investment in the region.

The bill is being drafted by the State Department. It is understood that arms aid to Europe is based on the Military Assistance Act. This clause was originally included in the Marshall Plan by the Senate, but the State Department, fearing that the inclusion of military clauses in economic aid would provide the Communists with a basis for destructive propaganda before the Italian election, requested that the House remove it. Connally also stated that he had discussed this plan with Undersecretary of State Lovett on the 28th, but he could not disclose the details of the conversation. Although this plan has not yet reached fruition, he expects it to be completed soon.

Stassen did not mention the Soviet Union, only stating that the United States should especially invite the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to participate.

### Situation in Palestine Rapidly Deteriorating: Syrian and Lebanese Forces Invade Holy Land; Jewish Strike Force Fiercely Attacks New City of Jerusalem

[United Press, Jerusalem, 1st] The Jewish Haganah forces declared today that the armies of Syria and Lebanon invaded northern Palestine at dawn today, arriving at three Jewish residential areas in the morning and launching a fierce attack. This is the first time that neighboring Arab countries have openly invaded Palestine.

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] Attempts by UN organs to bring about a ceasefire in Palestine appear to have failed today. The US, French, and Belgian Truce Committee in Jerusalem telegraphed the Security Council, reporting that the general situation in Palestine has rapidly deteriorated, the war is gradually expanding, and normal activities have come to a standstill.

At the same time, Arab Higher Committee Vice Chairman Husseini declared that the Jewish army's offensive in the New City of Jerusalem has completely shattered hopes for a ceasefire in the Old City. However, the UN Trusteeship Council still believes that the ceasefire agreement should take effect in the Old City and hopes to formally issue a ceasefire order to both Jewish and Arab sides today. In addition, telecommunications from various parts of the Middle East indicate that the situation in the Holy Land is serious. The battle for the New City of Jerusalem is being intensified, and the Jewish army currently has the upper hand.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 30th] Jewish strike forces today stormed into southern Jerusalem, appearing to have surrounded several Arab positions. The Arab forces are deploying troops from all over to reinforce the area. Street talk is rife that the battle for the Holy Land is about to begin. According to a spokesman for the Jewish Agency, British High Commissioner Fowler has notified the Jewish side that if they continue to fight, the British will use all their land and air forces against them.

US Formally Proposes Holy City Trusteeship Plan

[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] The US proposal for an emergency trusteeship of Jerusalem has gained some support from UN organs tonight. The plan stipulates that the UN representative stationed in Jerusalem may, when necessary, call on UN member states to send troops to maintain order.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] The consular corps of the US, France, and Belgium, which are mediating the ceasefire in the Old City of Jerusalem, telegraphed the President of the Security Council today, stating that the Jewish Agency has proposed three ceasefire conditions: (1) Jews must have free access to the Old City (because the Old City is currently controlled by Arabs); (2) Arab armed forces must withdraw from Palestine; (3) Maintain the traffic lines from Jerusalem to all parts of Palestine. After the consular corps submitted these conditions to the Arab side, the Arab side has not yet responded.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 30th] The Arabs of Palestine told the UN Trusteeship Council on the 30th that the conditions proposed by the Jews clearly hinder the plan for a ceasefire in the Holy City.

Five Arab Nations Hold Military Conference

[United Press International, Amman, 30th] Military leaders from five Arab nations held a meeting here on the 30th, and it is reported that they have resolved to launch a "war of attrition" against the Jews of Palestine after May 15. According to sources close to the meeting, Arab strategists do not favor a blitzkrieg because they lack the tens of thousands of well-trained and well-equipped troops necessary for such a war.

[United Press International, Seoul, 30th] The Soviet puppet government of North Korea, in opposition to the UN plan for Korea, formulated a constitution here on the 30th, claiming jurisdiction over all of Korea, including the US-occupied areas. This Soviet-style constitution designates Seoul, currently occupied by US forces, as its capital. The constitution stipulates that the current capital will be temporarily located in Pyongyang, which is currently the capital of the Soviet-occupied area. This matter was announced by Pyongyang Broadcasting Station, a bubble show amidst the tense atmosphere throughout South Korea at the end of the Labor Day week.

After the Korean Constitution was formulated, the obstacle to Soviet recognition of the new government was removed. After that, the Soviet Union can disclaim responsibility for whatever happens in Korea. US military commander Hodge still insists that the Soviet Union should be responsible for the North Korean government. The constitution also laid the foundation for a possible Soviet withdrawal from North Korea, leaving the United States occupying half of Korea in a Soviet "colony." The constitution was approved by the North Korean People's Committee, which is a communist-controlled provisional government in the Soviet-occupied area. The constitution stipulates the election of a parliament and the appointment of fifteen people as the Presidium, which is the real ruling body. The constitution stipulates that mining, forests, public utilities, and other "important enterprises" shall be nationalized, and formulates a new national flag with a sickle and hammer crossed, naming the new government the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea." When the Pyongyang declaration reached General Hodge, he disclosed a letter he sent to Soviet commander of North Korea, Kolokov, on April 27, stating: "I do not recognize the People's Committee as the government of North Korea, and I do not wish to negotiate with the People's Committee."

### Socony Oil Tanker Imported and Inspected, Two Corpses Buried at Sea, Large Quantity of Opium Discovered

[Report from This Newspaper] The Socony Oil Company tanker "Charles M. Schwab," which discovered the corpses of two Chinese crew members and a large quantity of smuggled goods on its way to Shanghai, sailed into the Wusongkou yesterday morning during high tide and berthed at the Socony Wharf in Pudong. Customs inspectors, customs police, and port quarantine personnel boarded the ship by speedboat for inspection when it passed through the Wusongkou. Socony Shipping Department Manager Rogers and British Consulate Secretary Holliday also went to investigate. The smuggled goods found on board were four large bags of opium, weighing 153 pounds, worth about more than a hundred gold bars. The bodies of the two Chinese crew members were immediately buried at sea by order of the shipowner in accordance with maritime law, and thrown into the South China Sea. Crew members on board unanimously believed that the huge amount of opium was smuggled by the two deceased Chinese crew members, and that their cause of death was that they entered the tightly closed and unventilated sluice gate to hide the opium, inhaled dirty gas, and died of poisoning.

The "Charles M. Schwab" weighs 14,000 tons and has a draft of more than 30 feet. It departed from the Persian Gulf at the end of March to transport oil eastward, passing through Mumbai in mid-April, and discovered the corpses and opium on the 25th. There are a total of 64 crew members on board, of which only the two deceased were Chinese, named Dai Zongsu and A Xi (both transliterations). The former's position on board was a mechanical fitter, and had been working for a year. The latter was a carpenter, and had only been working for a month. It is understood that they were both hired in Mumbai, India. The place where the two bodies were found was in a box-shaped sluice gate on the right side of the hull between the oil tank and the engine, which was designed for safety. This sluice gate is below the deck, tens of feet deep, with water accumulating inside. The exit is a cylinder that can only accommodate one person, protruding from the deck. It is usually tightly closed with a lid, so the internal air is very foul, and entering it is life-threatening.

### Missing Persons Discovered, Full Ship Search

According to shipowner Simpson's report on the discovery of the two corpses and the opium, "At 9:00 a.m. on April 25, while the ship was sailing at sea, I received a report that A Xi and Dai Zongsu were missing. Because they were not seen coming to eat breakfast, the cook searched everywhere for them, but could not find them. I immediately gathered all the crew members and ordered them to search separately. Chief Engineer Groom first discovered that the round cover of the box-shaped sluice gate on the right side of the hull had been lifted, and a rope was tightly tied to the coal bunker pipe nearby, with one end hanging into the sluice gate. Upon inspection, carpenter A Xi was hanging at the bottom of the sluice gate, with the rope tied under his armpits, so he was immediately pulled up. However, the corpse was already stiff. Later, Second Engineer Johnson entered the sluice gate with a gas mask and searched, discovering that Dai Zongsu was lying in the water about 18 inches from the bottom of the ship. He was also hoisted up with a pulley, and upon touching him, he was also stiff."

### Both Corpses Showed No Wounds

Both corpses clearly had been dead for quite some time, and there were no traces of violent acts on their bodies. Further searching in the sluice gate revealed the electric torches they had used. It occurred to me that the reason the two men entered the sluice gate might have been to hide some kind of contraband. Later, a search of their cabin revealed four packages of opium, weighing a total of 153 pounds. I believe the two men entered the sluice gate, filled with stagnant air and sewage gas, in the dead of night between the 24th and 25th to hide contraband, and died of poisoning as a result. The corpses were subsequently buried at sea at 10:45 AM at 12.44 degrees north latitude and 111.34 degrees east longitude. On the 26th, orders were again issued to search the entire ship, but nothing else was found,” it was said.

### Seized Opium to Be Handed Over to Police Bureau

Customs officers thoroughly searched the entire ship yesterday, but no other discoveries were made. More than one hundred pounds of opium will be handed over to the Narcotics Control Committee of the Police Bureau tomorrow for processing. It is said that this opium is of excellent quality and may have been smuggled on board when the ship passed through Bombay and is local Indian produce. As to whether it was indeed brought on board by the two Chinese crew members and whether there are other secrets to their deaths, since the bodies have already been buried at sea, there is no way to explore the mystery other than through the captain’s report.

### Mega-Swindler Hu Ruxin Arrested, Victims Numbering Hundreds, Police Bureau Hopes Victims Will Come Forward

[Report from this newspaper] The Penglai Police Sub-Bureau arrested a "big swindler," Hu Ruxin (24 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 14 Xincheng Lane, Xicang Street, Nanshi), near Laoximen yesterday. The victims number in the hundreds, and his whereabouts were extremely mysterious. The Police Bureau had even offered a reward for his arrest. The criminal Hu usually wore a Western suit and leather shoes, appearing to be a high-society figure. He confessed to his swindling activities at the police station yesterday, including: (1) In May of last year, he defrauded Ma Honglin of No. 1 Qing'an Lane, Beijing West Road, of fifteen large and small diamond rings with two bad checks, estimated at over 100 million yuan at the then-market price. Afterwards, Hu fled without a trace, and the victim reported the incident to the Yemiao Police Sub-Station and placed a reward of 10 million yuan for his arrest in the newspaper. (2) Soon after, Hu sold off these items and secretly established the Xianle Singing and Dancing Troupe at No. 222 Linsen Middle Road under an assumed name. He advertised to recruit members, eventually recruiting more than 30 members, all young women. After the fact, he took these women to Hangzhou and other places and forced them to sing for money, with all income split three-seven. To this day, some of the families of these deceived women are still unaware of the details. (3) On March 26th of this year, Hu came to Shanghai and stayed at the home of his friend Zhang Hanmin at No. 33 Wenmiao Road. Seeing that Zhang had an empty house, he secretly advertised to transfer it to Zhu Rongren, obtaining 40 million yuan. He fled the next day. It was not until Zhu officially moved in that he realized he had been swindled and reported the incident to the Penglai Police Sub-Bureau. (4) On the 27th of last month, Hu, again in the name of the Xianle Singing and Dancing Troupe, advertised for staff. Dozens of applicants responded. After collecting a guarantee deposit of 20 million yuan from each person, he disappeared again. As a result, victims such as Hua Yifeng reported the incident to the police station. Currently, the police station hopes that all victims will come to the station to make statements and has applied to the District Procuratorate for detention for further investigation.

### Secret Radio Station Busted, Female Radio Operator on Trial, Claims to Be Unclear About Content of Telegrams, He Rongfu Claims All Reports Were Commercial Information

[Report from this newspaper] Some time ago, the Garrison Headquarters discovered a "Guangdong Secret Radio Station" at No. 30, Lane 129, Haige Road in this city, which specialized in sending daily Shanghai market information to Guangzhou. When the Garrison Headquarters first discovered it, it thought it was a secret radio station of the Communist bandits. The female radio operator, Wu Lizhen, was arrested on the spot, and according to clues, a branch station was also busted at No. 426 Zhapu Road, and three radio operators, Chen Xiong, Wu Jing, and He Rongfu, were arrested. After investigation by the District Procuratorate, they were prosecuted for the crime of "illegally setting up a radio station."

Yesterday morning, Judge Cao Zushi of the District Court opened the trial. Wu Lizhen testified, "The radio station received telegrams using both clear and encrypted codes. The sending and receiving addresses were replaced by Arabic letters. The Haige Road radio station was "03," and the Zhapu Road radio station was "02." As for the telegrams received every day, I reported them to a Miss Liang at a specified time. As for what the telegrams said, I am not clear. There was a Mr. Li Yimin and another Mr. Zheng in charge of the radio station. We rarely had contact with them. They used the telephone to investigate work and were very secretive, making it impossible to find out."

In the afternoon, the trial continued with He Rongfu, who was in custody. His testimony was roughly the same as Wu's, but He was very familiar with the telegram codes, claiming that the telegrams going back and forth from the radio station were all market information between Shanghai and Guangzhou. As for the whereabouts of the person in charge, he said he did not know. Because the main culprit had not been arrested, the court adjourned the hearing to the 8th.

### Jiang Customs Auctions Treasures, Jiang Zhenyu Buys with Huge Sum

[Report from this newspaper] The United Auction House of this city, entrusted by the Jiang Customs, auctioned a valuable rectangular rose-red diamond weighing 5.84 carats at the Yizhong Auction House the day before yesterday morning.

If we do not defeat communism, we will not be able to live and work in peace. (2) In terms of politics: We cannot deny that we are indeed dissatisfied with the status quo to some extent. For example, a small number of corrupt officials and bureaucrats are exploiting the people. We must defeat these corrupt officials. We hope that the new government after the implementation of the constitution will definitely change the perfunctory tactics of the past and move towards the path of reform. (3) In terms of economy: Because our country's production is backward, we need labor-management cooperation to increase production. We must defeat the powerful capital, bureaucratic capital, and profiteers who manipulate hoarding, so that national industries have the opportunity to fully develop. (4) As for the workers themselves: Because workers' lives have indeed improved compared to before after wages are calculated according to the cost of living index, this is the KMT's labor policy. The status of the labor circle in China after the implementation of the constitution is even more important. The principle of people's livelihood in the Three People's Principles must be thoroughly implemented, and the trade union itself should also work hard to learn.

Seek Progress in Stability

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, stating that workers are the greatest force for stabilizing Shanghai. At present, China should seek progress in stability, not seek reform in destruction. The current wars in China are due to the destruction of the Communist bandits. But today we can say that there is light in sight, which can be divided into three areas: (1) The good and evil of democracy and communism have become increasingly clear. Recently, the Communist bandits attempted to destroy the city's power plants, disregarding the lives of citizens and the production of factories. Their despicable and vicious methods have been known to all citizens. The conspiracy of the Communist bandits has been exposed. (2) Recently, more than 30 Communist bandits have surrendered to the city's security organs. This phenomenon indicates that the beliefs of the Communist bandits themselves have been shaken. (3) The government is determined to reform politics and thoroughly implement democracy. Chairman Fang said in his speech: This Labor Day coincides with the beginning of democracy. The sacred status of labor has been determined, and labor welfare should be further improved and established. Labor education is especially important. The labor circle should unite and not be exploited by the Communist bandits or be divided. Under the leadership of the National Federation of Trade Unions, they should work together for democratic construction.

Divisive Conspiracy Cannot Be Implemented

Deputy Minister Lu said: Our country's workers are progressing year by year, and in the future, we must further organize and exert our strength to make great contributions to the suppression of the rebellion and construction of the country. Director Wu Kaixian said: The establishment of the National Federation of Trade Unions is a glorious page in the history of the entire labor movement in our country. After the victory, the government firmly advocated that wages be calculated according to the cost of living index, ensuring the lives of workers and stabilizing the order of production. Therefore, the divisive and destructive conspiracy of the Communist bandits cannot be implemented. In the future, the labor circle should unite, strengthen the organization, expel conspirators, and withdraw from the labor circle. Subsequently, the representatives of the labor circle, Qu Hanmin, and others, gave return speeches, which won applause from the entire audience. Then, the telegram congratulated Chairman Chiang and General Li Zongren on being elected President and Vice President, telegrams were sent to trade unions in various countries to congratulate them on Labor Day, and there were declarations of the meeting and letters to workers. Finally, Chairman Shui Xiangyun presided over the award ceremony for the labor circle's table tennis league. After the ceremony, the meeting was adjourned with slogans, and the time was 11:30 AM.

### Loud Drums and Shouting Slogans

The masquerade train parade was originally scheduled to start at 2:00 PM at the Penglai Market in the Nanshi district. However, the weather suddenly changed in the afternoon, with thick clouds gathering. To prevent rain, the parade was started early at 1:40 PM. A total of 209 trucks participated, each with elaborately decorated floats representing airplanes, the earth, wheels, and various industrial products, symbolizing the greatness of labor. Drums were loudly beaten in the trucks, slogans were posted along the way, leaflets were distributed, and slogans were shouted. The parade started from Penglai Road, passing through Laoximen, South Tibet Road, the Great World, Avenue Edward VII, the Garden Bridge, Yangshupu Road, Ward Road, Zhapu Road Bridge, Beijing Road, Jiangxi Road, Nanjing Road, Gordon Road, Robison Road, Caojiadu, Great Western Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Shanzhong Road, Avenue Joffre, and entering Xianqiao before dispersing at the original starting point. Despite the heavy rain, the parade trucks did not stop. However, when passing the Grand Theatre, a truck from the No. 1 Knitting Factory of the China Textile Industries Corporation crashed into the truck in front due to slow braking, injuring one worker. An ambulance was immediately called to take the injured worker to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment.

### Export Exchange Settlement Gradually Decreasing; Relevant Authorities Considering Remedial Measures

According to sources, the amount of exchange settlement for export goods has been gradually decreasing. In the past, the average monthly exchange settlement was US$13.4 million, but it has sharply decreased last month. According to unofficial estimates, the exchange settlement figure for April is less than US$10 million. There are two reasons for this: (1) The exchange rate is too low, and many exporters are taking risks to smuggle goods; (2) Many exporters are colluding with foreign importers to report lower foreign market prices, thereby evading foreign exchange. If this phenomenon is not prevented, the country will suffer significant losses. A reporter from the United Press has interviewed a leading figure in the export industry to seek opinions on remedial measures. According to him, firstly, the export licensing system should still be implemented to prevent the malpractice of underreporting prices, but this may lead to more severe smuggling. Secondly, an import and export linking system should be implemented, where a portion of the foreign exchange earned from exports is retained to purchase domestically needed materials, import raw materials for export product manufacturing, and import packaging materials. This should also be extended to agricultural products, but it may easily cause fluctuations in the black market. Thirdly, a minimum exchange settlement method for export goods should be adopted, with weekly determinations based on domestic and foreign market prices and posted exchange rates. The standard should be slightly lower than the foreign market prices, so that exporters can obtain a portion of the exchange rate difference. This is a more practical method, and the relevant authorities are currently considering these opinions.

### Rice Prices in Both Northern and Southern Markets Rebound; Flour, Grains, and Edible Oils Follow Suit

The rice market is firm because the price of household ration rice increased this month, and the quantity has been reduced. In addition, Wuxi has continuously reported price increases. Those holding goods are even more tightly holding onto prices. At the beginning of the market, prices were shouted up by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, but because the price increase was too high, the local merchants dared not enter the market rashly, and prices soon fell back. In the northern market, Japonica thin rice and Indica rice finally rose by 200,000 yuan, with white Japonica rice reaching 4.15 million yuan from 4 million yuan, and extra-high Japonica rice reaching 4.35 million yuan. In the southern market, early rice rose by 200,000 yuan, then retreated slightly by 100,000 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 100,000 yuan. However, after the market closed, it was heard that the northern market had risen more, so prices were shouted up again by 50,000 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals were 5,452 dan.

Flour

As the market opened in the morning, the holders of goods immediately took the opportunity to try to raise prices, and actual sales also rushed to replenish stocks. Military ship, Lao Che, Red Bee, Jiancheng, and miscellaneous brands of flour were all priced above 1.4 million yuan. Wheat bran followed suit, rising by 25,000 yuan. Wheat remained at 2 million yuan.

Grains

Most grains rose. Soybeans rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, corn rose by 50,000 yuan, red sorghum also rose by 50,000 yuan, mung beans stopped falling and started to rise, rising by more than 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Guangdong were strongly sought after, with goods from Qinhuangdao priced above 8 million yuan, an increase of 550,000 yuan. Selected green skin and sesame seeds from Tianjin were not sought after and fell by 150,000 yuan.

Edible Oil

Edible oils generally rose, with oil factories raising prices. With the increase in the price of household rationed oil, retail investors had strong sentiments, absorbing more than selling, and although some goods were released, sales were very good. Soya bean oil was at 8.78 million yuan, an increase of 280,000 yuan. Jitung raw oil returned to the 10 million yuan mark, closing at 10.05 million yuan, a net increase of 250,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rose by 250,000 yuan. Small-wheeled sesame oil was not accepted by Guangdong merchants, and the increase was the smallest, only 50,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were absorbed by both retail and Guangdong merchants, adding 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

### Market Conditions in Various Regions

### Overseas Tung Oil Market Conditions Remain Extremely Weak This Week

[Reported by Our Newspaper] After the China Trust Bureau raised the purchase price of tung oil to 9.5 million yuan per dan on the 26th of this month, it purchased a total of 550 tons in one week.

[Another News] The China Trust Bureau's Barter Department released a market report on tung oil and bristles this week, stating that the overseas market for tung oil remains extremely weak. The spot price in New York is 23.5 cents per pound, and the contract price is 22.5 cents per pound. However, because the tung oil smuggled from South China is sufficient to meet the needs of the United States, the market has not improved yet.

The overseas market for bristles is still good, but prices are getting higher and higher, and American brush factories are not daring to buy too much. Fortunately, the supply is not large, so it can barely be called stable.

### Listing Issues of Capital Increase Payment Receipts

— Du Ruixiang

For the organization of a limited liability company, in this time of currency inflation, issuing corporate bonds is not enough to arouse the interest of investors. And borrowing from banks not only requires bearing huge interest expenses, but is also extremely difficult to obtain, so the only option is to increase capital from shareholders to meet needs. Increasing capital and recruiting new shares should be decided by a shareholders' meeting. And after collecting all the new shares, it is still necessary to convene a meeting of new and old shareholders, and even apply for a change of registration, obtain a certificate, and exchange the stocks before listing and trading. The period from the decision to increase capital to listing and trading is at least three months, and at most half a year, which greatly affects the liquidity of the shares. Or even when increasing capital each time, all the old shares issued before are recalled and exchanged for payment receipts. Since it is a receipt and not a stock, it cannot be listed and traded. In the past, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, in view of this actual difficulty, referred to the provisions of the Civil Law on the pre-contract transfer method, and stipulated it in the exchange's business rules, which were approved and implemented. After the deadline at the end of the thirty-sixth year, in January of the thirty-seventh year, the two ministries of finance and economy formulated six handling methods for the expired period of the Measures for Pre-Contract Transfer of Shares of Listed Companies, and the sixth provision stipulated: "From the date of arrival of the document, those who report to the institute for capital increase, or increase capital by re-evaluating the fixed asset value of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in accordance with the valuation capital increase method, shall not list the number of shares after the capital increase unless they have applied for a change of registration and exchanged for new shares."

According to the last paragraph of the sixth provision of the above-mentioned measures, "the number of shares after the capital increase shall not be listed," it seems that the listing must be completely suspended during the period of applying for a change of registration because new shares have not been exchanged. However, according to the second paragraph of the fourth provision of the measures, "all shall be temporarily listed according to the original number of shares before the capital increase," it is known that the old shares before the capital increase can be listed and traded. Article 257, paragraph 2 of the Company Law stipulates, "New shares shall not be issued or transferred before registration," which is sufficient to prove that the transfer of new shares cannot be listed and traded on the basis of new shares until after the change of registration has been approved. As for the old shares before the capital increase, there is no provision that they cannot be transferred, and there is no restriction that they must be listed together with the new shares after the capital increase.

Recently, the two ministries of finance and economy have re-formulated supplementary provisions to the above-mentioned sixth provision, and the new shares after the capital increase can be listed and traded in one of the following ways: (1) The original stock is attached with the capital increase payment receipt for trading, (2) The stock is annotated to indicate the capital increase matters, and the original stock is still used for trading, (3) The capital increase payment receipt is annotated to indicate that there is no equity temporarily and the stock is separated for ex-rights trading. Observing the above-mentioned first and second methods, one is to attach the original stock with the capital increase payment receipt for trading, and the other is to annotate the capital increase matters on the original stock and still use the original stock for trading. The trading is actually a mixed trading of old shares and new shares. The third method seems to refer to the fact that the capital increase payment receipt cannot be transferred before registration, nor can it participate in the shareholders' meeting to exercise shareholder rights, but it can be separated from the old shares for ex-rights trading, which is still contrary to the provisions of Article 257, paragraph 2 of the Company Law, "New shares shall not be issued or transferred before registration." And since it is allowed to be listed and traded, but it is restricted from being unable to transfer, unable to participate in shareholders' meetings, and unable to exercise shareholder rights, how can it be said to be fair. And to interpret the words "shareholder rights" literally, it should refer to the abbreviation of shareholder rights. The rights of shareholders to the company are extremely broad. If classified according to the object of the rights, there are individual rights and collective rights. The so-called "temporary absence of shareholder rights," if it refers to the temporary absence of all shareholder rights, then the capital increase payment receipt is equal to waste paper. If it refers to the temporary absence of the right to request a change of name for the stock, and to attend the shareholders' meeting to exercise voting rights, etc., then it is not clearly stated. Moreover, the rights of shareholders to the company are expressly granted by the Company Law, so how can those who hold shares be deprived of their shareholder rights, and those who no longer have shares still have shareholder rights, which is really difficult to understand in terms of emotion and reason. And as for the so-called ex-rights trading, from the observation of the above, it is a trading that removes shareholder rights, which is also very different from the commonly called trading that removes subscription rights and the trading that removes dividend rights. Rather than making such far-fetched regulations, and when necessary, it is difficult for the company to convene a shareholders' meeting, and there are many problems, or even being manipulated, which turns into abuses, it is better to restore the originally established pre-contract transfer method, so that new shares can be listed and traded.

### All-China Games Anecdotes: Xu Heng Rescues Chen Ce Amidst Turbulent Waves

Xu Heng, a versatile athlete renowned in football, basketball, volleyball, swimming, and all-around sports, has been invited by Admiral Gui of the Navy to serve as the Deputy Director-General and Instructor of the Navy's delegation to the All-China Games. He said, "If the event times don't conflict, I want to play everything."

If time does not permit, he still intends to participate in his favorite sport, swimming. According to last year's tests, his freestyle swimming performance is 27.8 seconds for 50 meters and 65.6 seconds for 100 meters.

He said: "The strongest short-distance swimmers in this Games, as far as I've seen, should be the representatives from Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou." Facing strong opponents, he will strive to do his best.

He started his athletic career early, representing the Chinese volleyball team at the Eighth Far Eastern Games at the age of seventeen, playing right forward, and winning the championship. At the Ninth Far Eastern Games, he was again selected as a representative of the Chinese football team, playing goalkeeper, and also won the championship. Both championships were the only championships China won in the two Far Eastern Games, which is quite a coincidence.

After Hong Kong was captured by the Japanese enemy, a few remaining small warships broke out and were shelled by the enemy, sinking. Amidst the turbulent waves, he calmly used his swimming talent to rescue Commander Chen Ce, Hong Kong Acting Governor McDonald, and more than twenty other senior officials. The British government awarded him a medal for this.

Talking about the Navy's strength in ball sports, he believes that the basketball team is stronger. He specifically pointed out several strong players, including Liu Zhengjun, Yu Ruizhang, Liu Jingxing, and Ma Canxi, who have a good chance of reaching the semi-finals at the All-China Games.

He expressed regret for the decline of sports after the war. He felt especially melancholic about the gradual passing of old athletes. He said: "Of the players on the Chinese volleyball team that attended the four Far Eastern Games, only three of us, including myself, Guang, and Li Fushen, are still active in the sports arena."

He is thirty-seven years old, six feet two inches tall, weighs 190 pounds, and is strong and youthful, still like a young man. No wonder he had many romances in the past. He said that he has no hobbies, so youth stays with him. However, he admits that he has fewer opportunities to exercise now, and his body is getting a little fat.

His naval rank is lieutenant commander. He served as the first captain of the Yongning warship. He has temporarily left the military for business, cooperating with Cai Yanxiong in the Siamese timber business.

Cai Yanxiong, a famous basketball point guard and athlete at the last World Games, is known for his high-speed dribbling and defense. He has been renowned in the basketball world for more than ten years, not by chance. This time, he is still the point guard for the Shanghai team.

In his view, the only sign of progress in Shanghai sports in recent years should be basketball. He said: "This is still due to the constant exchanges and observations with foreign teams such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and the Philippines, which have gradually infused new blood into the Shanghai basketball team."

He believes that the Shanghai basketball team is still strong. The only strong enemy in the future will be the Philippines.

Regarding women's basketball, he does not dare to make definitive statements. However, he believes that Shanghai, Indonesia, and Guangdong are evenly matched.

The day before yesterday, more than one hundred overseas Chinese athletes staying at the Yangtze Hotel, accompanied by Liao Liejin, the Director of Overseas Chinese Reception, took four large buses to visit the Guangzhong Textile Factory. Each person received a gift of fabric for a women's cheongsam, which the female athletes used themselves, and the male athletes gave to their wives or lovers.

Liao Liejin said: "There are still several days before the opening ceremony of the Games. He is pondering over how to arrange an entertainment program for the overseas Chinese athletes so that they have something to do both physically and mentally. Visiting Guangzhong is just the beginning."

At 3 PM on the 4th, the Welcome Overseas Chinese Representatives Committee will hold a grand welcome reception at the Lido Garden, presided over by Chairman Huang Yuyi.

Looking at the program, there are already known performances, including Zhang Guoling's violin solo, flag presentations, Chen Lizhen's soprano solo, Xu Mianqing's Nanyang songs, and Liu Meiying's pointe dance. In short, it is guaranteed to be exciting and lively.

The Siamese delegation will fly in from Hong Kong at around 2 PM this afternoon. The characteristic of this team is that enthusiastic people from the cultural and sports circles are responsible for raising funds to participate. This is different from the general delegations initiated and presided over by wealthy merchants and gentlemen.

For example, the Director-General of the Siamese team, Qi Xixiong, is the Chairman of the Siamese Chinese Sports Federation and the Journalists Association, and the General Manager of the Zhongyuan Daily. Zheng Wulou, the Chairman of the Siamese Team Organizing Committee, is the Chairman of the Siamese Relief for the Motherland Famine Relief Association, proving that scholars can also lead troops.

The most noteworthy athlete in the Siamese team is swimmer Hong Sese, who has a time of 3 minutes and 45 seconds in the 200-meter breaststroke, which is close to the national record and should show off her skills at the Games.

### Cursing

— Jingwen

Regarding the matter of cursing, it seems that no one has ever researched its origin. According to my presumptuous speculation, cursing probably originated from criticism, or it can be said to be a branch of criticism. Criticism that tends to be sharp and slanderous is close to cursing. The editors of the readers' letters columns of various newspapers now state that they will not publish anything that is personal attacks or exposes private secrets, which means that although criticism is acceptable, cursing is not.

Although cursing may have originated from criticism, the implied meanings of the two are different. The object of criticism is generally based on the matter itself, and even if it occasionally involves personal matters, it probably originates from the event. As for cursing, it is obviously entirely a matter of emotion. When a person starts cursing, it is nothing more than that reason has reached its limit, and they have no choice but to resort to emotion to find relief. However, when Mi Heng in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms cursed Cao Cao, and Zhuge Liang cursed Wang Lang, although it was called cursing, it was actually satire.

Satire is naturally something that belongs to the category of criticism. The difference between it and cursing is that the former is like the stinger of a bee, relatively hidden, and not aimless; as for cursing, it is like the barking of a rabid dog, although the momentum is fierce, it only makes people feel annoyed. Moreover, if you hear it too much, even the intimidating effect will disappear.

Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there have been figures who identify themselves as eccentric scholars and enjoy cursing all living beings. They are dissatisfied with everything and look down on everyone. However, apart from the unrestrained scolding in their writings, they are very likely to put forward reasonable criticisms and concrete proposals. As for the private lives of these people, they are probably more immoral than the people they scold.

This is not to say that the act of cursing is completely unacceptable. Since people cannot help but have feelings of love and hate, venting hateful emotions by cursing heartily may not be a bad method, as long as the cursing is reasonable, appropriate, and makes the person being cursed feel unable to refute it, and makes the person being cursed feel sincerely convinced, then you have understood the "art of cursing."

However, cursing is ultimately not as good as persuading, because cursing is an act that comes from emotion, and it often easily causes a psychological backlash in the person being cursed. It is rare to find real examples of using cursing to achieve a moral effect. For example, the large turtles often seen on walls have existed in Shanghai's alleyway society for who knows how many years, but so far, they have not only failed to achieve the effect of sanctions, but have instead become promotional advertisements. Taking the small to illustrate the large, the mutual scolding between opposing camps in political parties and in the international community has achieved nothing except making national and world affairs even more serious. And it will never have any results.

People, regardless of their intelligence, foolishness, virtue, or lack thereof, probably all have some self-esteem, which is the self-awareness that makes people human. Reason is the foundation of morality in human society. There are too many things in society now that make people feel angry. Not only is cursing not enough, but most of them cannot be resolved with a single curse. The so-called hearts of people have already opened the floodgates, and the words "morality and justice" have become a lone boat in the sea of human desires. "Let them laugh and curse, I will do what I want" has almost become the universal attitude of people today.

In response to this phenomenon, I believe that rather than cursing bitterly, it is better to constantly remind everyone: "We are still human beings," which may be more effective. Because if "he" no longer considers himself a human being, then cursing is superfluous. Writing to this point, I feel that the four characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Sense of Shame" on top of the International Hotel should perhaps be replaced with the aforementioned four characters "We are Human Beings" in order to suit the needs of the times.

### Lending a Wife

— Fang Ping

"Lending a wife" is a very common thing among the Eskimo people in the icy and snowy Arctic, just as "lending money" is very common in other ethnic groups. Moreover, their lending of wives is much more generous than our lending of money. There are two reasons for this: First, this is one of the customs to be observed; second, this is a duty to be fulfilled in terms of friendship.

The Eskimos do not ask for any monetary or material rewards for lending their wives, nor do they necessarily seek the woman's consent. According to their customs, the request to borrow a wife should be made directly to her husband, because he has absolute rights to dispose of his wife. Otherwise, there will never be a smooth result.

They take the matter of "lending a wife" so commonly that when distinguished guests fill the ice cellar, the petitioner can casually make his request. Others will not feel surprised, and neither party will feel embarrassed. A request, a reply, others listening, as if discussing a very ordinary transaction.

When night falls and the candles burn out, the man who lends his wife will crawl into his fur sleeping bag alone, and let his wife sleep with another man. Three people sleep in the same ice cellar at the same time, without jealousy or resentment, and without shyness. The whole night is spent in an atmosphere of peace and harmony.

It is said that some white people have also made the same request, and as a result, they were treated with the same courtesy as the locals.

The Eskimos believe that lending their wife not only causes them no loss, but also fulfills their duty to their friends; why not do it! Therefore, they are not at all stingy with lending their wives. But when he understands that you not only want to borrow, but actually want to seize his wife, then he will kill you without mercy, even if you are his close friend for many years.

### "Living Immortal Maiden" Not Unique

— Nian Ren

A recent report from this newspaper's Chongqing correspondent stated that a "Living Immortal Maiden" named Yang Mei was discovered there, who had not eaten for nine years but lived a normal life, which people found strange. According to this, this matter is indeed rare, but it is not unique. A similar thing has happened in my county. The details are as follows:

My friend Chu, who is a doctor, once told me: In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there was a woman surnamed Tan near Zhuqiao (east of Haining City), who was about 15 or 16 years old. She suffered from typhoid fever, and after recovering, all her physical strength and behavior returned to normal, but she did not want to eat grains. She would vomit as soon as she ate them. She only drank a little boiled water and fruit every day, but she did not ask for it even if she was not given it. Her family was very worried at first, and tried every means to treat her without success. They did not know why. Later, they had no choice but to let nature take its course. There were no other changes. She worked like a normal person, but her palms were as red as cinnabar, and she had a bowel movement every 40 days or so. People thought it was strange, and no one dared to marry her. After 11 years, she suddenly wanted to eat, and then she ate as usual. She is now married and has children.

According to the above, Yang Mei may be able to resume eating one day, which is not certain. I hope someone with good intentions will keep her in their care in order to observe future changes.

Here, I have a fantasy: If scientists can figure out the reason why she can survive without eating, and then figure out a way to achieve this artificially, then there will be a way to treat hunger and a way to abstain from grains. The people will no longer have to worry about rice, and the problem of food will be solved. The world's disputes will then be greatly reduced. This may also be an effective way to achieve lasting world peace.

### Talking About Bees

— Ruzi

In the animal world, the bee seems to be a "lone warrior" who will "throw a punch" at the slightest provocation, making people afraid to get close to it. Isn't the "sting on the tail of a wasp" something we have long been wary of?

In fact, bees are not that fierce or scary, just a little irritable. Maeterlinck mentioned in "The Anger of Bees" that even the most irritable bees, if you first offer them nectar to appease their starving stomachs, they will lose the courage to be angry.

It is true that the nature of bees is not very docile. Be careful not to anger them! Otherwise, they will never forgive their enemies.

However, a bee loses its own life with a single sting. Therefore, when it gives the enemy the "final blow," its own end has also arrived.

As Maeterlinck said, "For certain people, it has an uncontrollable hatred." Although it loses its life because of a moment of anger, it is ultimately able to hate and dare to hate. Compared with the head-bowing worms that bow and scrape all day long, the little bee is still a respectable little creature!

### Crane Dance Poetry Record

— Half-Dream Old Man

"Cranes" are not commonly seen in Shanghai. Mr. Huang Yueyuan of Gao'an Road has one in his garden. It is said that it is over a hundred years old and can dance. My old friend Qian Mengfu told me about it. I sent a poem to Mr. Huang, saying: "Everywhere the felt is used, the sheep is laughed at, but it is the training work in the Huang Garden, the three-fold musical mind communicates affectionately, the thousand-year-old jade feathers shine in the cold sky. The strong bones of Leimen are raised on the banks of the river, the fairy posture of Gouling shines on the east sea, only for the lonely and high period to be unparalleled in the world, not to let the beautiful companions be sick in the cage. The clear whistling of the vast sky is heard in Jiugao, the white sleeves and black dress emerge early from the crowd, facing the green peaks to return to accompany me, the boat returns to the Red Cliff to meet you at night, warming up the solitary mountain dream of the fugitive guest, transforming into a cloud of Su Xian, I am ashamed of having no outstanding wings beyond the dust, the old feathers dance in the military atmosphere." Mr. Huang thought it could be adopted and bound into a volume.

A few days later, Mr. Huang asked for a painting on paper, so I painted a picture of a dancing crane and gave it to him. The following year, I went to Huang Garden with Old Man Meng to watch the crane dance. Mr. Huang personally adjusted it, and the crane listened to his commands, dancing in a rhythmic manner, demonstrating that it was well-trained. At that time, the foreign invaders were rampant, and Old Man Meng and I were listening to Master Yingci's lecture on the Diamond Sutra in Tong Garden, so I got the following verses: "There are fierce tigers in front and poisonous snakes behind, with ferocious faces and wolf teeth, struggling to fly but suffering from the cramp, often facing the pliers and nets and sighing. Suddenly, I hear the roar of a lion, and wonderful meanings intertwine like flying heavenly flowers, Old Man Meng has surplus interest in listening to the sutra, and leads me to Huang Garden to tread on the quiet victory. The owner of Huang Garden is elegant and moral, the walls are full of beautiful flowers shining on the path, the splendid jade volume is placed on the table, and artists and talented people all give it away, the old man's vulgar verses are also included, and he is ashamed that the elaborate decoration is not worthy. The host is hospitable and loves cranes, with red tops and frost-colored feathers, the clear cry of Huating cannot be heard, and the immortal ceremony of the red pavilion is not bad; Kailand God stands out in majestic posture, and lingers on the steps, the host beckons and the crane dances, advancing and retreating and circling in a proper manner, sometimes lifting up and sometimes falling down and squatting, sometimes like a dragon leaping or a phoenix squatting, the white and raised neck is speckled with frost and snow, the black and fluttering wings turn the universe. It is a pity that the precious bird is trapped in the rice grains, and the cage is tamed like cattle and sheep, the heavenly hearing of Jiugao is now gone, and the high and proud bones are opened in vain! Why not fly high for thousands of feet and return to the deep mountains and dense forests to your homeland? What is there to take in the confusing world, and what is the benefit of relying on Dou Sheng? Crane, crane, the parting cannot be seen, the host sends off the guest and the crane enters the orchid, the west wind rustles and blows the feathers, the yellow dust fills the road and the white day is remnant. Returning home, I sigh three times for the crane, not allowing me to be sad for the crane, but sad for myself, sitting in the barren road and leaving thorns!" After that, I never visited Huang Garden again, and I don't know if the crane is still alive and well?

Cranes are chosen for their strange and handsome appearance, clear and bright cries, the neck should be thin and long, the feet should be thin and jointed, the body should stand upright, and the back should be straight, which is in line with the wonderful qualities. To keep cranes in a garden, it is necessary to first build a wide platform on a high hill or earth mound for them to make clear cries. A thatched hut is the most suitable for housing cranes, and it should be next to a pond for them to bathe in. Feed them with fish, grains, and fruits. When they are hungry, place food in the open field and have a child clap his hands and stomp his feet to lure them. After they are accustomed to it, they will dance as soon as they hear the clapping of hands. This is the method of teaching cranes to dance. Among the feathered birds, the crane is the most elegant and can be used for leisurely entertainment. Adorning one or two cranes among green pines and green bamboos is a wonderful addition to a painting. In the past, Lin Bu, a hermit on Gushan Mountain, treated cranes as his sons, and the Crane Release Pavilion still stands tall on the West Lake for thousands of years, truly worthy of an elegant person with deep emotions. During the Qing Dynasty, Minister Weng Songchan lost a crane and wrote the two large characters "Visiting Crane" and posted them on the main street. The calligraphy was wonderful and divine, and it was a popular story at the time. Huang Garden also has a parrot, but unfortunately it cannot speak. Parrots are suitable for red windows and green pavilions, but they are not as elegant as cranes. Poets rarely mention them, and that is why.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

People often put the four words "long life without aging" together, but in fact, "not aging" is happiness, and "long life" is hard to say.

The distance between people is magical and elusive. Sometimes, people who see each other day and night are like being far away in the sky; those who are really far away in the sky, even beyond the sky, can sometimes be close at hand.

### Touring Dongting West Mountain

— Shi Shufan

Together with Sanmu, I and the "Friends' Voice" colleagues arrived at Muzhi. We drank at the Shijia Hotel. The reed buds were just emerging, and the mandarin fish had not yet arrived. I was quite regretful that I would not be able to see the old Osmanthus trees in full bloom, filling the world with fragrance! The hotel is not far from the tower. The sound of the wind from the tower seems to be coming from the tower. The next morning, we set out from the ferry. Passing by the Wu Zixu Temple, fine rain fell on the canopy. The distant mountains were like ink applied to water, and the seventy-two peaks floated and sank with the vast ocean, ethereal and boundless. We climbed Stone Duke Mountain and explored the Twilight Cave. The mulberry trees and paulownia trees lined the road, and various flowers adorned the fences, making it a picturesque scene. We sat in a thatched hall and tasted Biluochun tea, newly cultivated after the Grain Rain, and the aroma filled our noses and tongues. We passed Xiaoxia Bay and Mingyue Slope, all of which were historical sites of the King of Wu. To the southeast is Linwu Cave, also known as Dragon Cave. Next to it is a thatched hut, which is about to collapse after the chaos. Many bamboo rafts are built on the shore of the lake to set nets for fish and shrimp, which is all worth seeing.

Who can understand this desolation? I drunkenly scrawled in a hasty manner. The spirits of ancient and modern times are consumed in decline and chaos, the rouge and powder of Lingyan and the fish of Shijia.

The sound of the river carrying dreams is faint, the wind blowing from the estuary is light, and the raindrops are sparse. Crows gather on the trees, mourning the ancient phases. White waves wet the spring clothes. Without intention to build a fishermen's house, regardless of abundance in the fields, I think of the wild wild peas; unfortunately, the rivers and lakes are separated by reeds and willows, and I always see fire clouds flying deep at night.

The vast official lake is also busy with taxes. The will of heaven and the strength of the people are both weak and unclear. The tea leaves of West Mountain and the oranges of East Mountain make me think of the loquats in May.

The pods are full, and the mulberry trees are dry and clean. Wild flowers charm the guests, each without a name. Sitting in the lake tower watching the world, how many fish and dragons rise unevenly.

The socks in Xiaoxia Bay are covered with dust, and the grass on Mingyue Slope is green again. The dreams of the desolate lords, treacherous ministers, and enchanting women are turned into mountains and rivers for others in the dream. (Editor's note: Mr. Shi is inevitably rude to Xi Shi.)

The ancient cave hides a dragon sleeping soundly. This lake is good in the great Jiangnan. Tea boiling among the pines, what era is it shocking? An old, white-haired monk weeps in the thatched hut.

### 

I have heard that not only in the National Assembly in the capital, but also in the election situation in various localities, those who call out "conscience" are seen and heard repeatedly. It is obvious that "conscience" is the urgent demand of the masses, and it is also the justice of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. However, those who have always advocated "conscience" have always associated it with "heaven and earth." Except for the evidence on the stage (such as the Magic Lantern and A Blow of Snow), the good words and deeds of the sages, such as Yang Zhen's "Four Knows" in the Han Dynasty, are in this sense. His colleague Wang Mi sent him ten catties of gold, saying, "There is no one who knows at night." Old Mr. Yang said, "Heaven knows! Earth knows! You know! I know! What do you mean by no one knows?" This is another way of saying "There is heaven above, there is earth below, and we have a conscience." "Ten catties of gold" is certainly a considerable value. No matter what the life was like in the Han Dynasty, one catty is sixteen taels, and ten catties is one hundred and sixty taels. Now we should say "sixteen bars." But Mr. Yang Zhen lightly gave Mr. Wang a nail with four "know" words and returned it. It can be seen that although gold is expensive, it always has a market price. Even if it is hundreds of millions of Jinggai, it is still just a "number." As for "conscience," it is a priceless treasure. If it can be firmly maintained, even diamonds and stones of astronomical numbers cannot be exchanged for it! Not to mention gold banknotes?

The ancients talked about "conscience" must be combined with "heaven and earth." Because the "heart" is good or bad, there is no way to believe it, so it must be proved by heaven and earth, that is, the so-called "there are the sun and moon in the light, and there are ghosts and gods in the dark," and the external supervision goes hand in hand. However, in modern times, superstitions are broken, and there is no so-called heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods in the modern era. Relying only on the two words "conscience" is also fragile and vague.

### Strange Sights of Humans and Animals

— Wu Yong

Hugo: "In the animal kingdom, a pigeon is a pigeon from birth and will never turn into an owl later. This kind of metamorphosis only happens in the human world."

Remarque: "Lions kill antelopes, spiders kill flies, and foxes kill chicks; what else in the world is constantly fighting and killing each other?"

Maeterlinck: "The more truly you see humanity, the more you will like sea lions."

Plac: "There are no barbarians in Africa, and if there are, they are those who came from Europe."

Muns: "You only need to go to the zoo to see how barbaric we humans have become. The ferocious beasts are not in the iron cages, but standing in front of the iron cages."

### In Memory of Mr. Ye Qiuyuan (Part 2)

— Chu Yukun

In the 26th year of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Ye resigned from his position as a reporter for Shen Bao and went from Shanghai to Hong Kong, where he co-edited the English-language "Tianxia Monthly" with Dr. Wu Jingxiong, devoting himself to international publicity. Mr. Ye still did not leave the position of a news reporter. However, he gained more experience in the study of Catholic doctrine. Further attracted by Dr. Wu Jingxiong, he converted to Catholicism in Hong Kong in the 29th year. Strangely enough, Mr. Ye was a anti-religious youth in the past, but later his belief in Catholicism was more sincere than anyone else. While in Hong Kong, he co-edited the Ganlu Series with Dr. Wu Jingxiong, which was published by the Commercial Press. Mr. Ye was in charge of the selection of all the famous works and the recruitment of translators. However, Hong Kong soon fell, and the Commercial Press's Hong Kong branch closed down. It was not until after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War that it was able to be published. Two volumes have been published, one is "Introduction to Philosophy" and the other is "Progress and Religion."

After Hong Kong fell, Mr. Ye went to Chongqing. In addition to serving as a legislator, he also co-edited the "Truth Magazine" with Father Fang Jieren to promote the Holy Church. Soon Mr. Ye was invited by the British Council and the American Catholic Student Mission Society to visit the Catholic professions of various countries in Britain and the United States. In June of the 33rd year, he was granted permission to go abroad by Chairman Chiang, and finally set off on October 10th. During this trip, he passed through India, Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Ireland, and England, examining the Catholic affairs of various countries on the one hand and lobbying to correct international views on the other. When Mr. Ye was in London, Japan surrendered unconditionally. Mr. Ye said that he flew from England to Rome for pilgrimage, and hurriedly returned to China to report on his trip. He wrote a book called "Pilgrimage."

In November of the 34th year, Mr. Ye was in Chongqing and accepted the invitation of Shen Bao to fly to Shanghai with Mr. Chen Xunfu to serve as the chief writer. For the first few months, most of the editorials of Shen Bao were written by Mr. Ye. Mr. Ye was not only talented, but also knowledgeable. He had a considerable understanding of any issue and possessed the necessary qualities of a chief writer. However, he was very humble. I remember once the State Council's Personnel Office investigated the personnel of various newspapers and asked him to fill out a form. One of the columns was: What are your special strengths? He filled in the four words "Nothing Special." On the form, there was also: What are your aspirations? He also wrote the four words "No Aspirations," smiling and showing them to me. Mr. Ye seemed uninterested in politics. In the past seven or eight years, he had never said a word in any meeting he attended in the Legislative Yuan, so his name was rarely seen in the newspapers. In general, people did not know that he was a legislator. Every time he went to Nanjing for a meeting, he signed in and came back. I asked him what news there was in Nanjing, and he always shook his head and replied that there was nothing.

Mr. Ye had no hobbies in his life, but he liked to drink a few glasses of wine. "Mashanghou" often had his traces. He enjoyed drinking alone and found pleasure in it. His family was very happy. His wife was also a Catholic, and her health had always been strong. At the beginning of February this year, he suffered from heart disease, and he thought it was a stomach disease. It was not until he went to Gongji Hospital that he was diagnosed with cardiomegaly. I remember once, Mr. Fang Qiuwei and I went to see him. He had already gotten up and told us happily: "I'm cured, and I'll be discharged from the hospital soon. Thank you for your hard work these past few days!" We talked for a moment and then said goodbye. However, seeing the dark look on his face, it seemed that he still needed long-term recuperation. I never expected that he would not recover after his illness. Mr. Ye passed away at the age of 42, which is really a great loss to Chinese society!
