### The Battle of Bangbu and Su County: Communist Troops Suffer Initial Setback; National Army Deploys Sacks Array, Communist Supplies are Challenged and will be Forced to Retreat North

[Our Correspondent in Bangbu, 29th] Today is the second day since the start of the Battle of Bangbu and Su County. Communist troops suffered a major blow from the National Army in their initial offensive on the Hugou and Guzhen line and are now gathering their main forces to prepare for the next action. In order to implement its established strategy, the National Army has voluntarily abandoned Guzhen. The 3rd Army Corps of Huang Wei, Li Yannian, and Liu Ruming have deployed a sacks array in the Dangtu area of Bangbu. Some Communist troops crossed the Huai River today and engaged in fierce battles with the National Army on the east, west, and north sides of Xinqiao. The air forces of Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Bangbu continuously flew in to assist, causing considerable Communist casualties. According to general observations, the real start of the main forces battle will have to wait one or two more days.

[Central News Agency, Bangbu, 28th] The annihilation battle between Su County and Guzhen has begun. North of Guzhen, at 10:00 AM on the 28th, the National Army and the invading Chen Yi's Communist troops of the 11th, 12th, and 13th Columns engaged in artillery battles that did not stop all day. The air force also flew in to assist, inflicting serious blows on the Communist troops.

[Our Correspondent in Bangbu, 29th] Since Gu Zhutong came to Bangbu to make deployments, and Liu Zhi arrived here yesterday to take command, the National Army seems to have a major strategy in the Battle of Bangbu and Su County, that is, to attract the main force of the Communist troops to the area south of the Huai River, and then encircle and annihilate them. The current battle situation is developing in this direction. [Our Correspondent in Bangbu, 9th] According to an official close to Liu Zhi, Liu arrived at Zha yesterday afternoon, and yesterday evening and this morning, he separately met with various generals in this area, giving instructions or holding discussions. In the talks, Liu expressed extreme optimism about the current battle situation.

[Our Correspondent in Bangbu, 29th] The trains to Pu County are running as usual today. Military vehicles heading north from here can reach Xinqiao this morning. Also, the employees and equipment of Guzhen East Station were safely evacuated to Bangbu yesterday.

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] Military sources said today that the Communist troops of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng are venturing deep into the Central China region, and supplies are very difficult. Unless they can quickly win the battle, the Communist troops will have to retreat back to Shandong for supplies.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 29th] Zeng Xubai, Deputy Director of the Information Bureau, firmly denied on the 29th that the government had ordered the National Army to abandon Xuzhou and reinforce Bangbu to prevent the Communist troops from encroaching on the Yangtze River. He denounced the rumor as "completely unfounded and completely untrue." The cause of this rumor is probably that the government's two armies are going south, attached to the back of Su County, and joining the Battle of Bu and Su County.

### Fierce Fighting in Eastern Shaanxi; Yongfeng Town North of Dali Lost and Regained Several Times; National Army Launches Sweep Along the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 29th] The battle in eastern Shaanxi is proceeding fiercely. The Communist Army's Second Column and part of the Third and Fourth Columns, under the command of Wang Zhen, have been fiercely attacking Yongfeng Town north of Dali since the 26th. The fierce battle reached its climax on the 27th. The Communist artillery concentrated its firepower and coordinated with the Communist Army's offensive, breaching many of the village walls. The National Army bravely resisted, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. Yongfeng was lost and regained several times.

This National Army unit has captured Wuni Village and Wangwu Village and other strongholds and continues to advance north, engaging in fierce battles with the Communist troops. The Xi'an Air Force braved the bad weather on the 28th and flew to the front line in eastern Shaanxi to assist in the battle.

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 29th] After three days and nights of fierce fighting with the Communist Army's Fourth Brigade, the National Army unit originally defending Yongfeng was subjected to continuous fierce attacks by the Communist troops using human-wave tactics until noon on the 28th.

### Shift of Focus in Battle for Suburbs of Taiyuan; Bloody Battles in Northwest of the City; Communist Assault at Guankou Repulsed, Momentum Checked

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th] Fierce battles have broken out in the northwest area of Taiyuan. After suffering heavy losses in the Dongshan area and the northern and southern outer Guankou areas over the past two months, the invading Communist troops shifted their target. On the evening of the 27th, they ordered more than 2,000 men from their Seventh Column to launch a fierce attack on Guankou, more than 60 li northwest of the city, and the area near Sucun Baiban to the east. The defending troops and local militia engaged in a fierce battle with the Communist troops. After a day and night of bloody fighting, the Communist troops suffered heavy casualties. The morale of the National Army was high, and they fought more and more bravely. By the evening of the 28th, the Communist troops' offensive had been checked under the suppression of our intense firepower. In addition, more than 1,000 local Communist armed forces, who had just been recovered by the National Army in the Shiqianfeng north-south area, more than 40 li west of Taiyuan, sneaked back on the 28th, attempting to make trouble. The National Army is closely monitoring them.

(Another cable) The focus of the battle for the suburbs of Taiyuan has shifted to the northwest of the city and the mountainous areas to the west.

### Madame Chiang May Arrive in Washington Tomorrow; To Promote a New Movement to Aid China; Truman and Marshall Still Reviewing the Issue of Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, 29th] After Madame Chiang arrives in the United States, she is expected to promote a new movement to urge the United States to increase aid to China. Although the content of the new movement is unknown, most experts believe that Madame Chiang will request full U.S. aid based on the following two just reasons: (1) The Chinese government is not only suppressing internal unrest, but also expanding its resistance to communism on behalf of the United States and all other democratic countries. (2) It is the duty of the United States to provide the Chinese government with the assistance it needs to save the situation. As far as the United States is concerned, this is a rare opportunity. In the beginning, the Yalta Agreement between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union stipulated that the Soviet Union would obtain certain railway, port, and base rights in the nine eastern provinces of China, which was the reason why the Chinese Communists later won in the Northeast. For this point alone, the United States should also assist China to compensate for its mistakes.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The success of Madame Chiang's visit to the United States seems to depend on the reaction of the public and Congress, rather than any rapid change in the U.S. government's coolness toward the National Government. Officials admit that the hope for the success of Madame Chiang's trip lies in the impact she has on Congress and public opinion. Madame Chiang may arrive here on December 1 and is expected to be invited to attend committees or joint meetings of Congress to state China's needs. Legislative steps cannot be taken quickly now, but Madame Chiang's views can influence the actions of the new Congress in January. While waiting for more news from Nanjing about Madame Chiang's trip, there are currently no plans to formally host Madame Chiang at the White House or the State Department. According to Chinese officials, they expect Madame Chiang's trip to be "very short" because of the serious situation in China. Madame Chiang is expected to urge the United States to issue a clear statement supporting the Kuomintang's policies, and state that U.S. officials are more actively involved in strategic matters, and immediately increase the plan to aid China with military and economic assistance.

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] The hope that Madame Chiang will personally appeal to the U.S. Congress for more aid to China greatly increased on the 29th. Senator Smith, the Republican chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Aid Oversight, said that he would carefully consider the proposal to invite Madame Chiang to testify on Friday, which was proposed by Democratic Congressman Bloom. Bloom will soon succeed as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the new Congress, which is very important. Bloom also directly criticized the U.S. government for its delay in large-scale support of President Chiang's anti-communist war. But he said that Congress was tired of the talk about the corruption of the National Government. "If China needs more military equipment, we should handle it with appropriate people. We have to do something." Weller, a key Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also urged Congress to hear Madame Chiang's statement. He advocated that a joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives be held, and Madame Chiang would attend to testify.

[United Press, New York, 29th] The issue of the United States increasing aid to China is still under careful review by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, and no final decision has been made. Congressman Eaton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters bluntly: "I don't know how we can continue to aid China and make it effective immediately, because the Chinese problem is an international dispute, and no sage can predict its future." This statement can represent the official view of the United States, but it does not mean that there is a lack of sincerity in aiding China. What Americans are worried about is that full-scale aid to China will make the U.S. economy unbearable, so it must be carefully considered. Washington is also aware of Nanjing's accusation that Marshall has failed to provide China with adequate assistance. However, from the overall trend, the United States will inevitably give China reasonable assistance, while encouraging China to find its own way out.

### New York Daily Mirror Urges Aid to China to Resist Communism

Otherwise, There Will Be War on American Soil

[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] An editorial in the Hearst-owned New York Daily Mirror today stated that the United States' top priority is to prevent the Soviet Union from conquering China through the hands of the Chinese Communists. If this cannot be done successfully, there will sooner or later be war on American soil. If China fails, the Soviet Union can use the Chinese people as cannon fodder to conquer all of Asia. As a result, the United States will be completely cut off from other Pacific countries, and Hawaii will be extremely dangerous.

### Taixing Kou'an Town Once Fell to Communist Troops; Army and Navy Counterattack and Recapture; Scattered Communist Troops in the Triangle Area at the Junction of Zhenjiang and Danyang Cleared

[Our Correspondent in Jiangdu, 29th] Military sources: Liang Lingguang's three regiments of the Communist Army in central Jiangsu attacked Kou'an again on the 28th. The National Army was outnumbered and briefly lost the area. Then, the National Army in Taixing rushed to the rescue overnight, and the Jiangfang Navy rushed to bombard it at the same time. Kou'an was recaptured within 20 hours. The Communist troops suffered more than half of their casualties and have fled towards Sixiangkou and along the Yangtze River in Jiangdu.

[Our Correspondent in Taixing, 28th] (Delayed) The Communist Jingtai Independent Regiment and the Special Service Regiment of the Military Sub-district, gathered a crowd of 2,000, attacked the strongholds of Kou'an and Longwukou at about 10:00 PM on the 27th. Although the garrison troops, the county security team, and a National Army company were small in number, they were able to respond calmly. The fighting was fierce all night, and the artillery fire was intense. Although the warships in the estuary fired to assist in the battle, the Communist troops stubbornly refused to retreat. Qian, the magistrate of Taixing, personally led the local militia and cooperated with Yue's regiment of the National Army to advance towards Kou'an in two directions at dawn on the 28th to rush to the rescue.

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 29th] The Guishantou, Daluzhen, Dagangzhen, Luyingjiaqiao, and Shiqiaotou areas in the triangle area at the junction of Zhenjiang, Danyang, and Yangzhou have been constantly searched, suppressed, and attacked by the traffic police brigade in the past week. The remaining Communist troops have fled at the sight of the wind. The area is gradually entering a state of tranquility. Businesses are seeing prosperity again, and the people are living and working in peace.

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] The Ministry of the Navy today dispatched six warships to patrol the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and inspect ships to prevent Communist troops from sneaking in.

### The Campaign for the Successor President of the Legislative Yuan; Those Aspiring for the Position Begin Activities; Fu Sinian Declares He Does Not Intend to Participate

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] After Sun Ke decided to head the Executive Yuan, the question of who will succeed him as President of the Legislative Yuan has attracted the attention of many people. All parties are also deeply interested in the frequent contacts between various societies in the Legislative Yuan in recent days, because according to the Constitution, the candidate for President of the Legislative Yuan should be produced by the mutual election of the legislators. When the Legislative Yuan first met this spring, Sun Ke was elected President with unmatched advantages, and the competition for Vice President was also extremely fierce. Now, the position of President is vacant due to Sun Ke's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan. Although the date of the new President's mutual election still needs to wait until Sun Ke formally submits his resignation before it can be determined, those who aspire to the position have begun their campaign activities. Fu Sinian, who was supported by many northern legislators this spring and passively participated in the election for Vice President, becoming Chen Lifu's formidable rival, unexpectedly declared that under no circumstances does he intend to participate in the election. Huang Shaohong, who was eager to try at that time and almost defeated Chen Lifu, is also silent. Therefore, the main candidates are actually Chen Lifu and Wu Tiecheng. Chen is the current Vice President. The Reform Club he leads held a meeting on the 29th to discuss the election issue. Wu also has great potential in the Legislative Yuan. The Democratic Freedom Society organized by his supporters also held a meeting on the 28th to make preparations for the election. According to the situation a few days ago, Wu will be supported by various legislator groups of the Kuomintang's young and middle-aged members, such as the New Politics Club and the 14 Roundtable Conference. If so, his strength can compete with Chen's Reform Club. Therefore, before the new President's mutual election, the focus of the competition between the two sides will be the striving for non-aligned members. The reporter learned that many non-aligned legislators, who were still a mess in the first session, have automatically formed a very democratic organization in the second session. This organization is called the Zhengyou Society, and it aims to be objective, non-aligned, democratic, and excellent. Every Wednesday, more than a dozen committee members invite a tea party to exchange opinions extensively. It has been more than two months since then. Their efforts have increased the efficiency of the Legislative Yuan's deliberations in the Procedural Committee and the General Assembly. On the 29th, some members of the society, such as Song Shuqiao, Hong Ruizhao, and Lou Tongsun, publicly expressed their views on the new President's mutual election. They believe that: "The Kuomintang is the majority party in the Legislative Yuan. At a time when the enemy is approaching and the Sun Cabinet is yet to be formed, the strong unity of the various factions of the majority party is not enough to cope with the urgent crisis. The Legislative Yuan is the political center in the Constitution and should not be hurt by the President's election, so that the members of the majority party hurt their feelings and increase the split, repeating the mistakes of the past elections of the Vice President and Vice President. Therefore, it is unanimously advocated that the Kuomintang Central Committee nominate candidates, so as to avoid party comrades competing and increasing disputes, which will affect the suppression of the chaos." Judging from the current situation, the one hundred or so votes held by the Zhengyou Society have made them have a pivotal role in the competition for the new President. The reporter asked a member of the society on the 29th, if the Kuomintang Central Committee does not intend to nominate candidates, who will they support? The member replied that this question will be discussed at the society's tea party on the 1st, and that his personal opinion is that the Zhengyou Society has no preconceived notions about this choice. Both the Reform Club and the Democratic Freedom Society are trying to win the votes of the Zhengyou Society, but as of the 29th, the former seems to have a slight advantage.

### The Economic Cooperation Committee to Hold its First Meeting Within Days

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The Economic Cooperation Committee will hold its first meeting within days. Lin Weiying has been internally designated as the Secretary-General of the Committee. Lin has returned from the United States and arrived in Hong Kong, and is waiting for a flight to Nanjing. According to the organizational law, the Director of the Committee is concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan or designated by the President of the Executive Yuan. It has now been decided that Sun, the President of the Executive Yuan, will concurrently hold the post. In addition to those stipulated in the organizational law, the newly appointed Deputy Minister of Finance Shen Yuanding (officially announced on the 29th) is also one of the committee members and is responsible for important responsibilities. Shen is scheduled to come to Nanjing on the 30th.

### Grain Merchants to Purchase and Import Foreign Grain; All to be Exempt from Import Tax; Production Situation of Flour Mills in Shanghai Improves

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] According to the Grain News Agency: The war zone continues to expand, and the food shortage in cities is becoming increasingly serious. In order to avoid food shortages, the grain administration authorities are formulating measures to import foreign grain and encourage grain merchants to purchase grain. It is reported that in the above-mentioned measures, the foreign grain imported by grain merchants will be exempt from import tax, and it is planned to assist grain merchants in solving the difficulties of foreign exchange and transportation.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] According to the Grain News Agency: Chuan Guangze, a helpmate of the Regulatory Department of the Ministry of Food, went to Shanghai a few days ago to investigate the recent production situation of various flour mills. He returned to Nanjing on the 29th. According to him, the production situation of various mills in Shanghai has improved since the price limit was lifted. In November, the total output of finished products from various mills was more than 1.3 million bags, and it is estimated that in December it will be between 1.3 million and 1.5 million bags. The inventory of wheat is also abundant. According to the investigation, there are currently 3.5 million dan of wheat in stock, but manufacturers have difficulty in capital turnover. They hope that the government will provide reasonable assistance. It is best to entrust national banks and bureaus to adopt a ordering method of paying first and then picking up the goods, and purchase all the products at a uniform price.

### Chen Liang, Deputy Minister of Food, Goes to Beiping and Tianjin to Discuss the Purchase of Grain in the Haihe Area

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] In order to strengthen control over the grain supply in North China, the Ministry of Food has specially dispatched Chen Liang, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry, to go to Beiping and Tianjin immediately to discuss the issue of accelerating the purchase of grain in the Haihe area. In the future, the grain supply in North China can be made more abundant, ensuring that there will be no shortage.

### Howard Newspaper Comments: Sun Fo Forms Cabinet with Friendly Attitude; America Cannot Hesitate; Zhang Junmai Claims Democratic Socialist Party Will Not Participate in Politics; Youth Party Legislators Hope to Unleash People's Power to Rebuild Monetary Confidence

[United Press International, New York, 29th] An editorial in a Howard newspaper on the 29th praised Sun Fo for taking on the Executive Yuan. It also stated that whether the traditional friendship between China and the United States can be maintained, "depends on us, therefore we must not hesitate." The editorial stated that Sun's formation of a cabinet is a gesture of friendship toward the United States, as Sun studied in the United States and has a Western mindset and is a stalwart of the liberal faction.

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Junmai, in a conversation with visiting reporters yesterday, stated that in this cabinet reshuffle, the Democratic Socialist Party has decided to remain in the opposition to contribute to the country. Therefore, it is not considering participating in politics. He hopes that the various factions within the Kuomintang will unite after Premier Sun forms his cabinet. While political reform is necessary at this stage, diplomacy still depends mainly on ourselves. If we strengthen ourselves, foreign aid will naturally come. In terms of domestic affairs, he hopes that all measures will respect the system and the law, and new people should be employed as much as possible to bring a new atmosphere to politics. Personnel should be employed based on meritocracy. Provincial chairmen should be given real power, and people in various departments under the central government should also be given considerable authority, so that they do not have to ask the president for decisions on everything. At the same time, while all military measures are important, it is important to pay attention to winning people's hearts.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] News from the Legislative Yuan's press office: Youth Party legislators Li Gongquan, Su Ruzhan, Shi Yiren, Dong Wei, and others recently expressed their opinions on Sun Fo's succession as Premier of the Executive Yuan, stating: Premier Weng's resignation has been almost a month, and it was not until the 26th that the President proposed Sun Zhesheng as his successor. The Legislative Yuan immediately passed the motion with a large majority. Our opinion on Mr. Sun's succession as Premier is: (1) Mr. Sun has always advocated democratic politics, and since the War of Resistance, he has made great contributions to promoting our country's democratic constitutionalism. This time, he is taking office as the second cabinet after the implementation of the constitution, and we hope that Mr. Sun will establish more constitutional norms. (2) After Premier Weng submitted his resignation, there was a so-called "wartime cabinet" rumor. This system is fine for strengthening administration and combat power, but we hope that it will not affect the powers and responsibilities of the Legislative Yuan and become a measure that violates constitutionalism. We believe that Mr. Sun will pay attention to this after becoming Premier of the Executive Yuan. (3) In the past, government measures often guarded against the people, making people's power weaker and weaker. For example, the people's self-defense forces in various provinces now are much worse than in the past. We hope that after Mr. Sun takes office, he will let go and cultivate people's power and unleash people's power. As long as the government is confident that what it does is indeed for the people, the people will naturally support the government. (4) The government has lost faith with the people too many times in the past. The most obvious examples are the past gold savings and this currency reform. Now, the revised method of issuing gold yuan notes and exchanging gold and silver is to rebuild monetary confidence. We hope that after Mr. Sun forms his cabinet, he can implement it earnestly to "show great faith and demonstrate great fairness." (5) Finally, we see that Mr. Sun is staying in Shanghai, naturally to prepare for forming the cabinet, but at this urgent moment, it seems that there should not be much delay. We hope that he will return to Nanjing immediately to establish a new cabinet to comfort the hopes of the people throughout the country.

[Our City News] Premier Sun entered the Sino-Belgian Hospital yesterday morning due to his unhealed foot ailment and underwent surgery. The doctors treating Mr. Sun were Wu Huanxing and Lin Baihui. It is reported that the surgery went very well and he will be discharged from the hospital within days. However, during his hospitalization, he will follow the doctor's orders and rest, so he will not be receiving guests.

### The International United Front for Anti-Communism in the Far East – Can Start from Shanghai –

The overall situation of China's anti-communist war has evolved to this point. It is necessary to quickly conclude an international united front for anti-communism in the Far East, referring to the precedent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for anti-communism, and Shanghai is the best place to start.

Madame Chiang Kai-shek flew to the United States the night before last to appeal for stronger aid to China, and is expected to arrive in Washington tomorrow. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall are still reviewing how to effectively aid China, and no final decision has been made. According to a New York dispatch, looking at the general trend, the United States will definitely provide China with reasonable assistance, and at the same time, it will definitely encourage the Chinese people to help themselves. From this, we can know that our seeking help from the United States must be based on our efforts to help ourselves. If the Chinese people can help themselves, we firmly believe that friendly countries - especially the United States - will be able to help us. If the Chinese people can help themselves, then all countries that love democracy, peace, and freedom will be willing to help us as much as they can. In this way, the international united front for anti-communism in the Far East can be expected to be successfully concluded in China. Because, if democratic countries do not want to prevent the spread of communism, they cannot simply allow the Communist Party to rule China and then control the entire Asia.

In the Far Eastern anti-communist united front, China is the vanguard, the United States should be the main force behind it, and if England, France, Holland, Australia, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, Burma, Siam, Korea, - and even Japan after awakening, all those who do not want the people of the Far East to fall into the hands of the Communist Party and lose the right to a free life, should gradually unite to complete a strong defense line to counter the red iron curtain. It must be known that the Communist Parties of various countries under the command of the Communist International are tools for its world revolution, and originally belong to one body without national boundaries; if democratic countries still cannot understand and help each other to extinguish this gradually raging fire, it will eventually burn themselves!

Yesterday, the editorial of the Ta Mei Evening News advocated that: when Americans are considering a decision on China, we should obtain a firm United Front in China. This is of course a statement from the perspective of American journalists, thinking for the United States, but it is indeed necessary and can be said to truly resonate with my heart. As the Ta Mei Evening News said, while the British are advocating that the United States continue to provide China with strong and effective assistance, some British people are claiming that they will stay in Shanghai and "continue business," regardless of who the land falls into. Then Americans are like chivalrous people saving others, taking chestnuts out of the fire for others, and if they fail, they will suffer themselves, while others can benefit from "neutrality." Today, if we are still only considering the small calculation of possibly trading with the Communist Party, and ignoring the great disaster of the entire world turning red and changing the free way of life of mankind, no matter what country, it will be too late to regret it in the future! Are the British people not clear about the Communist Party's activities in Malaya? Taking China as an example, the treasures of the Northeast are occupied by the Communist Party and will inevitably be given to the Soviet Union, while the interests of British merchants in the Yangtze River basin and South China may be greater than those of American merchants. Can they dream of sharing a piece of the pie under the control of the Communist totalitarian regime? If the British are discerning, they will definitely not think this way. It is true that the British people must first take care of Europe, but in the Far East, if they want to maintain free trade, they cannot cooperate with China and the United States in time to form an anti-communist united front. Indeed, the United States is uniquely wealthy and can take on more important tasks, but logically speaking, how can Britain stay out of it?

As for China, the red fire has now burned to our home, and timely self-rescue is the responsibility that every citizen should have. As far as the government is concerned, it must not casually plan to retreat at this time. It must be known that "I can go, and the enemy can also go. Therefore, we must stand firm, deeply blame ourselves, and then call out loudly, calling on the people of the whole country, regardless of men, women, old or young, regardless of north, south, east, or west, regardless of whether they are in front of or behind the enemy, as long as they are people who do not want to be red slaves, they should rise up spontaneously, strongly oppose communism, and not coexist with the brutal bandits. We must swear to fight until the Communist bandits put down their murderous weapons. As far as the people are concerned, first of all, we must recognize that this anti-communist war is a war between a free way of life and a slave way of life, and a watershed between independence and extinction. In the areas controlled by the Communist Party, not only is everything communist, but also wives are shared. The refugees from the bandit areas can all speak of this with certainty. If this continues, not only will the country be destroyed, but the race will also be wiped out. Anyone who has a sense of Chinese history and has been nurtured by traditional culture should be aware that the red disaster is far worse than floods and beasts! If everyone only takes escape as their ability, thinking that they may be able to preserve their lives, they do not know that when the earth sinks, there is no place for individuals to stand. Only by striving for self-help, uniting together, contributing money and effort, and suppressing bandits and quelling chaos, can we save ourselves, save the country, save humanity, and save the world. If there are still people who think that when the Communist Party comes in the future, we can still trade freely, we can still talk freely, we can still freely own property, and freely maintain our lives, that is simply an incredible dream - today we are asking for help from international friends, looking up to see how the United States is doing, how the United Kingdom is doing, but looking back at ourselves, we are doing nothing at all, and not even pulling out a hair to help. What is this? Therefore, the formation of an international anti-communist united front in the Far East - in China - should start with the efforts of our Chinese people themselves.

Shanghai is an international city with more than a hundred years of history, and China's largest trading port. The concession system and unequal treaties are something that Chinese and foreign people alike do not want to see revived. However, among the millions of residents in Shanghai, there are Chinese and there are also expatriates from various countries, especially from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The Chinese people in Shanghai should not move casually, and the expatriates do not need to retreat arbitrarily. There is manpower, there are resources, and there is land, sea, and air transportation. As long as everyone unites to form an international anti-communist united front in Shanghai first, we do not believe that there is no local self-defense capability, and we do not believe that there is no chance to save China and save the world. It is up to people to make things happen, and heaven helps those who help themselves. May all our compatriots in the city and the country who love the country and love freedom, as well as friendly countries that uphold democracy and freedom, rise up together to plan this!

### The People on the Xuzhou-Bengbu Frontline are Extremely Calm and Firm; The Morale of the National Army Soldiers is also Unprecedented

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 29th] Although the distance between the war and Bengbu seems to be closer, the people's morale is still very stable. Heroic soldiers come and go on the Huai River railway bridge, and the citizens watch with excitement. Entertainment venues are also open as usual. Except for the fact that formal transactions in the market are scarce, the price of Yuan Datou silver dollars and gold has risen, and a few schools have begun to suspend classes in disguise, giving people a slight stimulus, this place hardly knows that a great battle with decisive significance for the country and the nation has begun more than sixty li away. However, the military authorities are now actively carrying out the work of eliminating traitors and preventing espionage.

Impressions of the Press Corps

[Central News Agency, Our City] The press corps of this city set off on the 25th for the Xuzhou front to interview. After four days, it returned to Shanghai via Nanjing on the 29th. The press corps felt deeply that "seeing is believing." The firmness and calmness of the people on the front line are in stark contrast to the rumors and gossip in the rear. In the historical Xuzhou campaign, the National Army has completed its initial victory. The second major battle is now taking shape in the area east and west of Suxian on the Jinpu South Line, and the military center of gravity has also shifted south from Xuzhou. Liu Zhi, Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, is now stationed in Bengbu to command. Liu pointed out when he met with reporters in Xuzhou that the Xuzhou campaign is actually the decisive battle of the entire Central China battlefield, and its significance is extraordinary. According to reports, the total number of casualties of the bandits in the first stage of the battle was more than 150,000, and the National Army suffered about 90,000 casualties. In the middle of this month, Xuzhou was quite tight at one point. At that time, General Du Yuming, who was in command, quickly moved the Qiu Qingquan Corps from the western front to the east to meet the Huang Baitao Corps, reversing the battle situation. This was a major strategic success. General Du, who has experienced many battles, has great confidence in the current second stage of the war. He said that the Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng bandit troops now gathered on the east and west sides of Suxian will definitely run into another big nail. He said in an optimistic tone: The southern section of Jinpu will definitely be opened up in the short term. He also said: The achievements of the joint operations of the army, navy and air force and tanks this time broke the record since the bandit suppression war. Du reviewed the bandit situation and believed that we should concentrate all manpower and material resources on the front, thoroughly implement total war to deal with the bandit's total war, which is the most urgent task at present. The reporters spent two days inspecting the eastern and southern battlefields, meeting with Qiu Qingquan and Sun Yuanliang, commanders of the two corps, and visiting the National Army's operations in the front-line trenches, witnessing the National Army's capture of bandit positions as if they were watching a war film in a theater. The National Army is well-equipped and has strong morale, which is not comparable to the bandit troops who were coerced into fighting. Zhang Daofan and Fang Zhi, the heads of the condolence delegations from Nanjing and Shanghai, led their members to the front line to comfort the soldiers, creating unprecedented achievements in the condolence work. The officers and soldiers were inspired and achieved great results.

What Foreign Reporters Saw

[United Press International, Xuzhou, 29th] The morale of the Central China National Army is unprecedented. The reporter flew to Nanjing today on the same plane with many wounded soldiers. I saw that these people had full faces and their clothes were very warm. The seriously wounded groaned without complaint, because they hoped that the pain would be reduced after arriving at the rear hospital, while the lightly wounded talked and laughed freely. A short Guangdong soldier, with his right shoulder wrapped in bandages, sat next to the reporter, looked up at me and smiled, stretched out his fist, and raised his thumb, saying "Very good"! This hillbilly had seen airplanes soaring in the sky, but had never tasted the thrill of sitting in an airplane. He was surprised and grateful for the opportunity to take off.

[United Press International, Xuzhou, 29th] Airplanes from various private Chinese airlines are stepping up the transportation of wounded soldiers from the front line to hospitals in the Nanjing-Shanghai area for treatment. Yesterday, 2,700 wounded soldiers were transported. China National Aviation Corporation has eleven airplanes, flying thirty-three flights a day. Central Air Transport Corporation has eight airplanes, flying twenty-four flights a day. The number of flights for the Civil Aviation Brigade is the same as that of Central. Roosevelt, the deputy manager of CNAC, said: The company is prepared to fly one hundred flights a day, and can increase the number if necessary. Airplanes come and go like weaving at the Xuzhou Southeast Airport. In addition to civil aviation airplanes, there are also B-24, B-25 and B-31 bombers departing to carry out combat missions.

### The Xuzhou Troop Condolence Mission Completes its Condolences; The Delegation Returns to Nanjing Today

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The first and second condolence delegations of the General Condolence Association have completed their condolences to the Qiu, Sun, and Li corps stationed near Xuzhou and the Xuzhou base air force, and are scheduled to take a plane back to Nanjing together on the 30th.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The first and second condolence delegations of the National Condolence Association set off in two groups today to condole the troops. The first group, led by Zhang Daofan, went to the front line south of Xuzhou to comfort all the soldiers of the Sun Yuanliang Corps. The second group, led by Fang Zhi, condoled the Li Mi Corps, the Xuzhou city defense troops, and the air force here.

### Memorial Week of the Wuhan Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters; Bai Chongxi Explains the War Situation; Emphasizes Winning the People and Implementing the People's Livelihood

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th] Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi attended the expanded Memorial Week of the Wuhan Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters this morning and delivered a speech, emphasizing the importance of winning the people and implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Bai said: The overthrow of the Manchu Qing was a success of the Principle of People's Rights, and the defeat of Japan was a success of the Principle of Nationalism, and both had the support of the broad masses of the people. The main reason why the military suppression of the rebellion is encountering setbacks today is that it is divorced from the people. To awaken the people and grasp the people, it is necessary to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood so that more than 80% of the farmers and workers can participate in the rebel suppression camp and thoroughly control the area. Bai praised the British Labour Party's achievements in stabilizing the people's livelihood and suppressing the Communist Party, and hoped that the provinces in Central China would first earnestly implement land reform. Finally, Bai pointed out that there are Korean Communists, Mongolian Communists, and Japanese Communists participating in the Chinese Communist Party, alerting the people not to be confused by the term "civil war," and firmly believing that "Heaven helps those who help themselves." If we can implement the Principle, the serious situation will definitely be reversed quickly.

### "Lenient Policy" is Terrible; Bandit's Means in Jinan are Vicious

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 29th] It is reported that when the bandits first occupied Jinan, they claimed to implement a lenient policy. The general public was tempted by this and returned to the city with their families. However, in less than a week, the bandits forced people aged 17 to 45 to form teams for training and fill out detailed information about their past experiences and education. Those considered suspicious were ordered to participate in "confession and reflection" conferences, forced to confess their crimes, transferred to the front line to serve as cannon fodder, or sent to our area for espionage work. However, in order to prevent them from defecting, the bandits concentrated the families of these dispatched personnel in a concentrated residence, euphemistically called "Preferential Management Office for the Families of Resisters," which was actually centralized supervision. If the work was not done well, their families would be secretly killed. The viciousness of the means is extreme.

### Supply Exceeds Demand, Market Prices Plummet: Wuxi Rice Falls Below 300 Yuan, One Grain Store Bankrupt with Over 300,000 Yuan in Losses

The establishment of a currency agreement may lead to the lifting of the Berlin blockade.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] Bramuglia's term as President of the Security Council for this month is about to expire. He is scheduled to go to Rome on Wednesday evening. At that time, the presidency of the Security Council will be taken over by the Belgian representative. Bramuglia believes that his plan can continue to be implemented after his departure.

[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] The acting chief representative of the United States to the United Nations, Dulles, said tonight that the risk of another world war breaking out has been greatly reduced. Dulles made this statement based on the belief that the United Nations will achieve a final solution to the Holy Land issue and may promote an agreement between East and West on the Berlin dispute. Dulles said that the "miscalculation" risk is the greatest threat to peace. The majority of the world's intentions are against aggression. Hitler or Caesar's hope to overcome other countries one by one no longer exists. Regarding the Berlin issue, Dulles reiterated the position of Western countries, insisting that the Soviet Union must first lift the Berlin blockade before negotiating the Berlin issue or the entire German issue. He said that the Soviet authorities are taking steps almost daily to split Berlin in two, which makes the four-power agreement more difficult to implement. However, we still believe that the Berlin problem can be solved, and the Security Council may enable the Soviet government to end its efforts to obtain political and economic control of the entire city of Berlin.

The United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, and Ukraine have clearly expressed their support, and only three more votes are needed from the other seven countries. According to well-informed sources in Britain, Britain's current position is that Israel should not be allowed to join the United Nations until the boundaries of the partition of Palestine are determined.

### Based on Hints from Various Allied Headquarters: Tojo et al. Executed by Hanging This Morning, MacArthur Formally Announces Support in Principle

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] According to a midday bulletin from the news liaison office here, the seven war criminals sentenced to hanging may have received notice that the executions will take place in 24 hours. However, the office did not directly state that it had issued the above notice, but only said that it had notified the prisoners that MacArthur supported the judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. It is believed that this statement is the 24-hour notice to the seven war criminals before their execution by hanging.

### Mei Ru'ao Gives a Detailed Account to Reporters on the Trial of Japanese War Criminals

Tojo and Others Sentenced to Death; Eleven Judges Argued Heatedly, Ultimately Deciding on Hanging by a Vote of Six to Five.

From a Legal Perspective, the Japanese Emperor Cannot Wash Away His Suspicions as a War Criminal.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] On the first Sunday after Tojo, Itagaki, Doihara, and Matsui, among other top Japanese war criminals, were sentenced to hang, reporters met Dr. Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, at the Imperial Hotel, where dignitaries of the occupying forces were lodged.

Judge Mei was one of the seven Allied judges responsible for drafting the court's historical "judgment," which spanned 1,218 pages. According to him, since the end of the court hearings around April of this year, when the drafting of the judgment began, his life for the past six months has been like that of a bookworm, buried in the nearly tens of thousands of pages of court documents and records.

Speaking to reporters about the historical significance of the Tokyo Tribunal, Judge Mei first pointed out that the scale and duration of the trial set a new record in the thousands of years of human judicial history.

During the nearly two-year trial period, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East held more than 800 sessions, calling nearly a thousand witnesses. "Some witnesses came from as far away as China, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the United Kingdom to testify in Tokyo." Nearly 4,800 pieces of evidence were presented, and the entire court record reached 50,000 pages, totaling 9,682,000 words, with expenses exceeding US$7.5 million.

In this regard, Judge Mei said that the Tokyo Tribunal could be said to be the largest trial in human history, and its 1,200-page judgment was also the longest judgment ever written.

In its judgment, the Tokyo Tribunal not only firmly upheld that aggressive war is an international crime and emphasized individual war responsibility, but also further ruled that civilian cabinet members should bear the same responsibility as military commanders for the atrocities committed by the military.

Judge Mei believed that this showed that the Tokyo Tribunal was more advanced than the Nuremberg Tribunal and was a further contribution of the Tokyo Tribunal to modern international law.

Judge Mei then gave a very detailed analysis and explanation of the Tokyo Tribunal's judgment, which was about 1,200 pages long.

The first hundred pages of the judgment describe the course and procedures of the trial and establish the legal basis applicable to each defendant. The next five hundred pages can be said to be a history of the Japanese militarists' conspiracy of aggression, pointing out how the Japanese militarists seized power, controlled power, and launched a series of aggressive wars.

In another five hundred pages of the judgment, an individual historical account is given of the series of aggressive wars waged by Japan, of which 250 pages are about China.

The final hundred pages or so can be said to be a history of the atrocities committed by the Japanese army, with the Nanjing Massacre being referred to as "one of the most heinous events" in the history of human civilization.

From the proportion of pages in the judgment, Judge Mei pointed out that the International Military Tribunal attached great importance to Japan's war of aggression against China. The court believed that the Japanese militarists' conspiracy and all aggressive wars began with the Mukden Incident. Judge Mei said that this must be said to be "the fairest historical assessment."

The severity of the sentences imposed on the twenty-five defendants was also based on this determination. Judge Mei said that among the seven war criminals sentenced to hang, at least five were directly related to the invasion of China: Doihara Kenji, who was known throughout China as the "head of special services" for creating the Mukden Incident; Itagaki Seishiro, who once dreamed of becoming the "Emperor of China"; Matsui Iwane, the head of the Nanjing Massacre; and Hirota Koki, the author of the "Three Hirota Principles." Tojo Hideki's main crime was undoubtedly launching the Pacific War, but his crimes in the Northeast during his time in the Kwantung Army and his policy of insisting on continuing the invasion of China during his time as Minister of the Army were also major crimes that earned him the death penalty.

Compared with the Nuremberg Tribunal, some say that the sentences of the Tokyo Tribunal were too harsh, while others say they were too lenient. In the Nuremberg Tribunal, three defendants were acquitted, while in the Tokyo Tribunal, except for Shigemitsu Mamoru and Togo Shigenori, who were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, the remaining twenty-three defendants were all sentenced to death or life imprisonment. From this point of view, the latter was stricter than the former, but judging solely from the number of defendants sentenced to death, the latter seemed to be more lenient than the former.

According to Judge Mei's explanation, the issue of the death penalty was the point on which the opinions of the eleven judges differed the most and the debate was the fiercest. The laws of the eleven countries represented by the eleven judges were different, so their opinions on sentencing were also different.

In the Soviet Union and New Zealand, the death penalty had long been abolished, so the judges of the two countries naturally strongly opposed sentencing war criminals to death. The United Kingdom and Australia had partially abolished the death penalty, so the judges of the two countries were also unwilling to vote for the death penalty. The Australian judge even advocated exiling war criminals to remote islands. As for the Indian judge, he opposed the trial of war criminals from beginning to end, advocating the acquittal of all defendants. Therefore, when the full court meeting discussed the issue of the death penalty, everyone argued heatedly and became very agitated. Finally, when it came to a vote, it was only with a majority of six to five votes that the use of hanging was approved.

Speaking of this, Judge Mei pushed up his tortoiseshell glasses with his right hand and said: For this problem, I don't know how much effort and energy I spent among my colleagues. For a whole week, I was so worried that I couldn't sleep well at night. If I couldn't even get a death sentence for these heads of the extremely heinous Japanese invaders of China, what face would I have to go back and see my elders in Jiangdong?

Finally, regarding the issue of the Japanese Emperor's suspicions as a war criminal, Judge Mei made the following statement to reporters:

"From a purely legal point of view, the Japanese Emperor cannot wash away his suspicions as a war criminal. In the two and a half years of the trial, we obtained countless pieces of evidence sufficient to prove that even if he was not one of the initiators of the Japanese conspiracy of aggressive war, he was at least a passive participant in the conspiracy. This alone is enough to constitute the crime of accessory.

We judges can only try and sentence the defendants listed in the indictment. The Emperor's name was not in the indictment, so the court could not try him. As for why he was not prosecuted, that is probably a political issue."

Judge Mei pointed out that the Japanese Emperor and the Emperor system are two different things. Although the Potsdam Declaration gave the Japanese people the freedom to choose a form of government (including the Emperor system), it did not give the Japanese or anyone else the right to shield the Japanese Emperor from war responsibility.

Even MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, did not have the right or qualification to declare Japanese Emperor Hirohito innocent. Judge Mei emphasized.

"To determine whether Emperor Hirohito is guilty or not, from a legal point of view, can only be resolved in an international court." Judge Mei said.

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Judge Mei continued, had no intention of shielding Emperor Hirohito from war responsibility. In the judgment, the facts are stated frankly. If someone takes passages out of context and extracts one or two paragraphs from the judgment to promote their own claims, then this is not something the International Military Tribunal can be responsible for and is irrelevant to the full text of the judgment.

The countenance of Webb (standing), the president of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, when pronouncing the sentences on the 25 Japanese war criminals. To Webb's right is Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao.

### Late-Night Bloodshed at the Jinshan Hotel: Army Officer Dies from Gunshot Wounds This Morning; Assailant Escapes, Female Teacher Detained in Connection

[Reported by this Newspaper] A shooting occurred in Room 221 of the Jinshan Hotel on Hankou Road at approximately 10:43 PM last night. The victim was Leng Jingbo (29, from Tianjin), a lieutenant colonel of infantry and staff officer in the 9425th unit of the Army. He was shot in the right chest, with the bullet not exiting. Leng immediately fell to the ground in response, with blood splattering everywhere. The assailant immediately rushed out the door and fled. Afterwards, the teahouse waiter hurriedly reported to the accounting office, who in turn reported to the Laozha Police Substation. Officer Tang Zhiliang was dispatched with police to pursue and apprehend the assailant, but he had already gone far away. Four spent bullet casings were later found in the room. The gun belonged to the victim, Leng Jingbo, and was numbered 440891. An ambulance was immediately summoned and rushed to the Renji Hospital for treatment. At the time, Leng's girlfriend, Cai Xiuda, was outside the room. Cai, 24, is a teacher at the Central National Primary School in Xiyongchang Town, Huangdai Township, Suzhou, and was taken back to the substation for questioning. According to Cai's statement, Leng arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd from Tangshan, accompanied by two adjutants, and lived alone in the said room. When Leng's army was stationed in Suzhou, they were introduced to each other and became friends. A few days ago, he sent a letter to Suzhou inviting her to Shanghai for a short stay, and she had just arrived this afternoon. As for the assailant, she only knew his surname was Wang, and did not know his full name. She had met him before at a banquet. At around 9 PM in the evening, the man surnamed Wang arrived and they chatted. There was a conflict between them in their words. After a while, a phone call came from outside, and Leng went to the front desk to answer it. This call was probably for the assailant, surnamed Wang. Leng immediately replied that he was not here and hurriedly returned to the room. At that time, the man surnamed Wang insisted on pushing her out, and Leng also did not want her to stay in the room, so she lingered outside the door. She speculated that the two sides seemed to have some negotiation going on that they did not want her to know. When the door was closed, before they had spoken a few words, she suddenly heard several gunshots, and then saw Wang open the door and rush downstairs with a gun. When she entered the room to check, she found that Leng had fallen in a pool of blood, barely breathing. She said that the argument between the two of them had lasted about an hour or so. According to the waiter at the establishment, the assailant, surnamed Wang, came here every day and sometimes went out together. After the investigating police officers searched and seized many letters, one of which was from Leng to Cai Xiuda, the text mentioned, "Since you are already engaged to Mr. Zuo Xiannan, I deeply hope for a happy marriage and wish you both a long life together. However, there are a few words that concern Mr. Wang. This person is terrible, often playing with guns, and plotting to harm me." Whether the assailant is indeed the man surnamed Wang is currently under detailed investigation by the substation. It was also discovered in Leng's wallet two engagement announcements clipped from the newspaper, with the man being Leng himself and the woman named Mei Shuying, who were engaged at 3 PM on April 4, 1948, in Changchun. After Leng was shot and sent to the hospital, surgeons performed an operation, but he ultimately died at approximately 2 AM this morning due to the bullet hitting a vital area and excessive blood loss. It is understood that the homicide case may be related to a love affair. The substation interrogated Leng's girlfriend, Cai Xiuda, overnight, and detectives were dispatched in all directions to apprehend the fugitive assailant.

### Worker Allotment of Coal Briquettes to Be Distributed on the 6th of Next Month; 25 Jin Per Person, Price 17 Yuan

[Reported by this Newspaper] The distribution of daily necessities for workers and their families in this city was originally scheduled to begin in November, but due to delays in procedures and insufficient preparation, it has not yet been distributed. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau has prepared the distribution of coal briquettes and has scheduled a date for distribution. The original plan was to distribute 50 jin per person based on a certificate, but it has now been changed to 25 jin of original coal briquettes made of pure coal dust, priced at 17 yuan, to be distributed starting December 6. The Social Affairs Bureau stipulates that industrial and occupational unions will collect the payments and issue the briquettes centrally. The payment will be advanced by the manufacturers and deducted from the workers' wages later. Each coal briquette factory will deliver the goods based on the notification slip from the Civil Affairs Committee. Each manufacturer is required to submit the payment for the required coal briquettes to the Civil Affairs Committee for collection before December 4 and issue a notification slip, which can be used to pick up the goods from the coal briquette factory.

The current distribution of coal briquettes to workers and their families involves a total of 320,000 units, requiring 16,000 tons of coal dust. As for the calculation of coal briquette prices when compiling the cost of living index, ordinary coal briquettes will still be used as the standard. Now, each person is allocated 25 jin of original coal briquettes priced at 17 yuan, which is equivalent to 34 yuan per unit of ordinary coal briquettes.

The distribution of coal briquettes for public and education personnel in October will begin on the 3rd of next month, and the distribution of coal for November and December will begin gradually after the distribution of October is completed.

### This Period's Index to Be Announced This Morning

Furthermore, announcing the index in the afternoon would make the salary calculation time for factories paying salaries on that day too tight.

### Emergency Meeting of the General Labor Union Discusses Prices of Worker Allotments

Four Resolutions Decided to Be Implemented by the Social Affairs Bureau

The following resolutions were passed: (1) Dissatisfaction was expressed with the method of distributing allotments to industrial or occupational workers based on household registration rice distribution districts. If the government insists on the labor union taking responsibility for this allotment, then the labor union will give up this allotment, but a remedy must be found for mobile workers. (2) The prices of worker allotments should be lower than the prices of household registration rice. If there is no household registration rice price as a proportion, then the allotment price should not exceed one-half of the market price. (3) The cost of living index for November cannot be calculated based on allotment prices. (4) All allotments must be completely distributed before December 15. It was also decided at the meeting that all executive directors would go to the Social Affairs Bureau today at 3 PM to petition.

### Bloodshed on Fanhuangdu Road: Worker Dies from Bullet; Drunken Fish Market Broker Opens Fire

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Yonghe, a fish market broker residing at No. 104, Yongqing Lane, Fanhuangdu Road, possessed a privately owned pistol. At approximately 1:50 PM yesterday, due to excessive alcohol consumption, he encountered a street cleaner near Kangding Road on Fanhuangdu Road.

### Stamping of Identity Cards to Be Handled by Bao Offices; Starts Tomorrow Without Time Restrictions

The new national identity cards with shopping permits previously issued in this city have been cut open by many citizens. It was previously stipulated that citizens should properly paste them together themselves and send them directly to the Civil Affairs Bureau for the bureau's seal to be stamped across the seam where the card was pasted, before being returned for use. However, since the process began the day before yesterday, the crowds have been extremely large and congested. Therefore, the method has been changed: the official seals will be stamped by the offices of each "bao." According to Civil Affairs Bureau Director Zhang, "It has been reported that a small number of citizens mistakenly cut off the shopping permits from the newly issued identity cards. Therefore, the municipal government decided on the above method. Initially, we did not expect that so many people would cut them off. Although the bureau had scheduled stamping dates for each district, the crowding over the past two days has been unbearable. In this crowded state, 'scalpers' have infiltrated and are charging fees to cut in line, and there are even printed statements requesting stamping that are being privately sold for two or three yuan each. This is illegal. After the scalpers infiltrated and started operating, it became even more difficult to maintain order, and the bureau had to suspend the stamping process. Now, to make it easier for citizens to get their cards stamped and to eliminate illegal profiteering by scalpers, the process has been changed so that each district office will instruct each 'bao' office to stamp the 'bao' seal on them starting on the first day of next month. There are no time restrictions, and it is not necessary to send them to the bureau for stamping, to avoid unnecessary travel and crowding."

There are many difficulties in relocating schools, and the city is currently quite stable, so it was decided not to relocate. It is hoped that all faculty and students will continue to teach and attend classes with peace of mind.

Also, the rice allocation for the schools for November has not been fully distributed for half a month.

### Kwang Hua University Decides Not to Increase Tuition; Students Launch Fundraising Campaign for Teachers

[Our Newspaper] Because the university decided not to increase tuition and miscellaneous fees for the second time, the students of private Kwang Hua University, in order to express their gratitude to the professors who continue to maintain their teaching despite financial difficulties, the students of the Departments of Politics and Law have initiated a joint effort with students from the entire university to organize a Teachers Appreciation Campaign Committee to raise 200,000 yuan as Teachers Appreciation Funds. Fundraising will be conducted from now until the end of December from alumni and all sectors of society. The fundraising methods include donations, charity sales, charity performances, and charity matches. The students of the university also hope that other schools can respond to this Teachers Appreciation Campaign. The Kwang Hua University Teachers Appreciation Campaign Donation Announcement states: "Jade must be carved to become a useful object, and people must learn to attain reason. Those who inherit the wisdom of the sages and enlighten future generations, and those who uphold culture and promote scholarship, are none other than teachers. Therefore, the achievements of teachers are indeed great. Since the War of Resistance, the people's livelihood has declined, and the cost of living has increased daily. However, the professors of our school are happy in their pursuits and content in their poverty, and they are dedicated to nurturing talents. They do not seek satisfaction in food, nor do they seek comfort in housing. They are not swayed by wealth and status, nor are they moved by poverty and humility. Gentlemen enjoy their pursuits, and this is always the case. Unfortunately, since the change in the currency system, prices have risen even more sharply, and the income of the professors is barely enough to feed themselves, let alone support their families. Now, the professors do not complain or blame, and the sound of their teaching has not ceased for a single day. The students, benefiting from their influence and guidance, discussed among themselves, saying that the way of the teacher should be respected, and that the work of the teacher is beneficial to the country and blesses future generations, and should be respected by all in the world. Therefore, we have launched a Teachers Appreciation Campaign to raise funds to reward their labor. We hope that wise men in the country and pioneers in society will respond to the call, save the scholarly atmosphere from being suppressed, and uphold the respect that should be given to the way of the teacher. Then the country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. This is the announcement."

### City Police Bureau Plans to Request Uniform National Identity Card Design

When checking the identities of travelers from various places, the City Police Bureau finds that the designs of identity cards from various provinces, cities, and counties are different, and the contents also vary greatly.

Morning Friends showed their long shots and used a rotating strategy to tire the enemy. Lehe could not support it, and the situation deteriorated. In the end, Morning Friends defeated Lehe by a large margin of 90 to 52.

### Loan for Exports to Begin Immediately as Decided by Discount Committee Yesterday; Exchange Transfer Certificate Market Price Stable after Initial Rise

The Central Bank Discount Committee convened a special meeting yesterday at noon, inviting responsible individuals from various banks and bureaus. Attendees included Yu Hongjun, Liu Gongyun, Lin Chong, Li Lixia, and Li Shuming, among over a dozen others, presided over personally by President Yu Hongjun. Regarding the restoration of loans by banks and bureaus, it is said that the meeting made two resolutions: (1) In the future, loans from various banks and bureaus will still be made from the banks' own deposits, with the principle of not increasing issuance. (2) Loans for important daily necessities and exports will be released earlier.

Another report: The market price of exchange transfer certificates rose sharply yesterday before stabilizing. It initially traded at 30 yuan, then rose to 30.5 yuan. Subsequently, exporters eagerly offered to sell, and the price returned to 28.75 yuan. The final price was 29.5 yuan, with increased trading volume compared to before. The Bank of China's remittance exchange rate rose by 2 yuan to 34 yuan.

Yesterday, credit was slightly tighter than before, with overnight interest rates rising by 0.3 to 0.35 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.9 to 1.05 yuan. Today being the end of the month, credit conditions may continue to tighten.

### National Bank Imposes No Restrictions on Quantity of Gold and Silver for Deposit and Exchange

Outside of Nanjing, Shanghai, and other locations, the authorities have decided that the handling of deposit and exchange services in all other regions will commence on time starting tomorrow. The Central Bank has been stepping up the transportation of gold and silver in recent days. As of yesterday morning, the gold and silver needed by over twenty locations had been sent separately by special planes from the bank, averaging over 10,000 taels of gold per location.

According to the responsible personnel of the bank: In recent days, due to the fluctuations of black market gold prices in the city, the number of people applying for exchange has become more and more enthusiastic. Those outside who do not understand the truth spread rumors of raising the exchange price and restricting exchange. Aside from the rumor of adjusting the exchange price having been disproven, the rumor of restricting the amount of exchange can also be verified as unfounded. Up until now, the Central Bank has never stipulated the amount of exchange.

Exchanging Gold and Silver Becomes More Crowded

Another report: The exchange of gold and silver for deposits was even more enthusiastic yesterday. The Central Bank and the three agencies of the Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Central Trust were all extremely crowded. A person in charge at the Central Bank stated: All exchanges this time require cash, so the procedure of counting banknotes is more troublesome, and the speed of exchange is not as ideal. The sudden increase in exchange is due to the rise in the black market price and the increase in the price of gold in Hong Kong. Generally speaking, unless there are special reasons, the black market will not fluctuate again.

No Restrictions on Sale of Gold Jewelry

According to Wu Pengnian, the chairman of the Shanghai Gold and Silver Trade Association, he told reporters: Regarding the reports that the industry has recently sold a large amount of jewelry, and for the sake of restriction, stipulated that 50 copper plates would be issued each day, and sales would be suspended if the quota was exceeded, this is not the case. However, because the source of jewelry for most businesses has not yet been resolved, they are all living within their means. As for purchasing jewelry, there are no restrictions. Anything from one qian to several liang can be purchased.

### Ministry of Finance to separately formulate Four Measures for Special Circumstances Regarding Capital Increase of Banks and Firms

It is reported that the Ministry of Finance, regarding those who have special circumstances and cannot go through the capital increase procedures according to the regulations, has separately formulated four measures: (1) All head offices and branches that are already in the occupied areas will be allowed to go through the capital increase procedures according to regulations within two months after the local areas are recovered and business is restored. (2) All head offices located in occupied areas, but with branches continuing to operate in free territories, will be temporarily allowed, before the head office can adjust its capital according to law, to deposit cash equivalent to one-tenth of the minimum capital amount standard of the location of each existing branch in the Central Bank, which will be returned after three months. Afterwards, if a branch resumes business, it should follow these regulations, and after the location of the head office is recovered and business is restored, go through the capital adjustment procedures within two months and increase the capital to the prescribed standard. (3) All head offices and branches located near the occupied areas, unable to operate, and having suspended business on their own and reported to the Ministry, will be allowed to go through the capital increase procedures according to law within two months after resuming business. (4) For banks with enemy or puppet shares, if the original enemy or puppet shares have not been completely handled according to law, the capital increase portion of its assets should still be handled according to regulations. As for the cash portion of the capital increase, in addition to other shareholders paying according to their share ratio, the enemy or puppet shares will be allowed to be paid up within one month after the handling is completed. Before the handling of these enemy or puppet shares is completed, the Ministry will send a letter to the relevant enemy or puppet property handling agencies to send personnel to represent the exercise of shareholder rights.

### Yarn Prices Stable, Cotton Cloth Market Firm

Yesterday's yarn market was firm but ended lower due to persistently narrow sales. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at 13,000 yuan. It rose to 13,600 yuan because of good transactions, but then individual sellers sold, causing the price to fall back to 13,000 yuan at closing, slightly better than the weekend by 100 yuan.

21-count Double Horse yarn also quietly opened at 9,600 yuan. When it appeared low, people entered, once as high as 10,3500 yuan.

Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose slightly by 100 to 300 yuan.

The cotton cloth market opened firm and stable in the morning. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened 10 yuan higher. Subsequently, due to the continuous large-scale search by the Guangdong and Hankou gangs, the buying atmosphere was strong. Those with goods took the opportunity to support prices, and the price rose again to 425 yuan. Ta Jie Men Zhuang sucked in, stepping up to 35 yuan. Near noon, absorption was rarer, floating households settled not lonely, and the price fell back to 460 yuan at closing, up 15 yuan from the weekend.

### Abundant Arrivals, People's Hearts Weak, Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Flour, Grain, and Cooking Oil Mostly Decline

The trend of falling rice prices intensified. Arrivals surged. Yesterday, a total of 13,202 shi arrived in the North and South markets. Prices in the production areas fell, and people's hearts were weak. Rice shops took very little intake, and it was difficult to sell. Cargo owners reduced prices for sale, and prices fell sharply. White Geng in the North market fell to 400 yuan, a sharp drop of 40 yuan compared to last week, a full 10%. Thin paddy also retreated to 400 yuan, early rice only 370 yuan, and other indica rice, etc., all fell by about 40 yuan. White Geng in the South market fell by 30 yuan, early rice fell by 40 yuan, and the market was very weak.

Flour

Turned to decline, due to the reported drop in rice prices, coupled with the downstream of the Tin City, people's hearts were depressed, actual sales contracted, and prices fell quite a bit. Old Car Flour opened and fell to 136 yuan, then fell further to 134 yuan, a sharp drop of 156 yuan from last Saturday. Bingchuan Flour was 132 yuan, also down more than 10 yuan, and other miscellaneous brand flours all fell by more than 10 yuan. Bran also fell by 10 yuan, retreating to 80 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Prices varied, with those patronized by customers rising, while soybeans were sluggish and alone did not prosper. Za beans were down 5 yuan, Du beans were down 10 yuan, corn was taken by the North gang and alcohol factories, rising 15 yuan. Red sorghum rose 20 yuan, and the liquor workshops in the mainland were selling well. Selected green supply was short, rising 10 yuan. Sesame was firm, and raw peanuts arrived less, rising sharply by 450 yuan.

### The First Round of the Battle of Xuzhou (Part 2)

— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou

[Special Report from Bengbu on the 26th] On the third day of the outbreak of the Battle of Xuzhou, the reporter passed through Zhenjiang on the way to Nanjing and met Cao Zunxian, the director of the military affairs department of that army. When talking about the battle situation on the eastern front of Xuzhou, Director Cao told me that the National Army would definitely win in the Battle of Xuzhou. He told reporters that their troops were near Nianzhuang. His return this time was because military supplies were urgently needed to be transported north, and he would return to the front in a day or two. At that time, I said to Director Cao, "When you return to the front, please say hello to Jinggong (General Zhou's courtesy name is Jingfang) for me!"

For the past two weeks, the focus of the battle has always been on the eastern wing. Amidst the frequent reports of victory, the reporter not only cheered for the victory of the National Army, but also prayed for the safety of several old acquaintances among the generals on the eastern front, such as Qiu Qingquan, Huang Baitao, and General Zhou, whom I am about to write about here. General Zhou has returned from being a prisoner. This news made me concerned about his health, but even more so, it filled me with infinite respect for General Zhou's spirit.

Victory in Two Battles of Tai

General Zhou is from Jiangxi and graduated from the fourth class of the military academy. During the War of Resistance, he was promoted to the commander of the 51st Division of the 74th Army due to his military exploits, and together with Zhang Lingfu and Li Tianxia, he was Wang Yaowu's right-hand man. In the middle of the War of Resistance, the 100th Army was established in Hunan, and Generals Li Tianxia and Zhou were appointed as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. In the process of suppressing the rebellion, the name of the 100th Army will not be unfamiliar to the people across the country. The Communist bandits launched their first offensive in the all-out rebellion in the Liangtai area of northern Jiangsu. It was the 100th Army that gave a fierce blow to the invading Communist bandits in the special circumstances at the time, crushing their dream of capturing Yangtai and threatening Nanjing and Shanghai. What's more, before that (during the War of Resistance), the 100th Army had won as many as seventeen certificates of military merit awarded by the Military Commission. In the subsequent pacification campaigns in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong, the 100th Army was even more victorious in every battle. The reason why the 100th Army was able to become a glorious unit with a "new army" (his number was the last one, there was no 101st Army). This was obviously entirely due to the effective leadership of Generals Li and Zhou. General Li Tianxia is now the deputy commander of the First Pacification Zone. He left the 100th Army in the summer of last year. After General Li left, General Zhou was promoted to commander, which had a familiar effect.

By the Ancient Yellow River

In March of this year, Chen Yi's bandit Second Column fled from southern Shandong to northern Jiangsu, and together with the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns originally in northern Jiangsu, attempted to move south to the Jianggan, realizing their crazy idea of "crossing the river in May." In mid-May, General Zhou was ordered to lead his troops from Linyi south to northern Jiangsu again to suppress the remaining bandits. The reporter followed the army's actions and fought all the way to Dezhen, the old nest of the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu on the coast of the Yellow Sea. The three columns of Chen Yi's troops, in addition to being embarrassed and broken, had no choice but to escape and hide in the area north of the Longhai Railway. The reporter had followed them on two occasions to do interviews. On horseback, in a jeep, General Zhou shuttled back and forth on both sides of the ancient Yellow River, and the reporter followed together for more than two weeks. By mid-June, the main force of Chen Yi's army had fled from northern Shandong to western Shandong, and when Yanzhou was under heavy siege by the Communist bandits, General Zhou's troops were transferred to the Jinyutai line again.

Serious and Profound

Among the generals the reporter personally came into contact with, Zhou was undoubtedly one of the generals with a serious attitude towards life. During the days the reporter spent with him, which added up to about three or four months, the reporter never saw him gamble once. In addition to books, he had a set of Chinese chess when he was not on military affairs. He also carried a set of "Poker" with him, but he was not preparing it for "Sha Crab" or "Russian Poker." This was what he was preparing for four people to play "Bridge." On the front line, the reporter had played this game with Zhou for several nights. Sometimes he would have interesting disputes with me over points. The reason why Zhou was addicted to these two pastimes was probably because Chinese chess required profound strategy and bridge required accurate estimation and judgment. As for wine and women, they had nothing to do with Zhou.

When the reporter and Zhou were parting in northern Jiangsu, he gave me a Communist bandit's "sickle flag" that had been intercepted as a souvenir. He also inscribed words on it. I clearly remember the following sentences: "The Communist bandits plant opium poppies everywhere in their so-called "liberated areas" and hang the Soviet flag. Isn't this ironclad proof of poisoning the people and selling out the country and the nation?" Through the small matter of personal acceptance, General Zhou still revealed his inner sense of justice in these small details. Therefore, it was by no means accidental that the 100th Army was able to win battles.

Gathering in Lanfeng

On June 25, the reporter followed Qiu Qingquan's corps from eastern Henan to press on to Kaifeng. At that time, Liu Maoen, the former chairman of Henan Province who broke out of Kaifeng, was living in the headquarters of the 100th Army stationed in Lanfeng. That day, General Qiu Qingquan received the news and immediately sent a car to pick him up. The reporter and Xiong Xiaosan, commander of the 5th Army, also went to General Zhou's place to welcome and comfort Liu. This was another meeting with General Zhou, and the gathering was very pleasant.

Infinite Nostalgia

From the 100th Army to the reorganized 83rd Division, and then from the reorganized 83rd Division to the 100th Army, the reporter has very deep feelings for every officer and soldier in this unit. Now, General Zhou was unfortunately injured while supervising the battle and flew to Shanghai for medical treatment. The reporter is on the edge of the artillery fire, and in addition to extending his best wishes to General Zhou for a speedy recovery, he also expresses his great nostalgia for the other generals and all the officers and soldiers of the army, whose current situation is still unknown!

### Tragic Incident of Being Buried Alive: Leprosy Patient Screams in Coffin

[Special Report from Changsha on the 27th] Leprosy is prevalent in Shoufu Township, Daoxian County, Hunan. The villagers do not know how to treat it and superstitiously believe that leprosy patients will infect their direct relatives after death. Therefore, they bury patients alive, hoping to eliminate the source of the disease. A man named Wang Zhen unfortunately contracted leprosy. His family was afraid of being infected, so they discussed it with the patient and carried out a live burial. To ensure the safety of his descendants, the patient agreed to be buried alive. Therefore, the family killed chickens and ducks, bought meat and wine, and prepared a feast to mark the farewell. After eating, Wang suddenly thought of the horror of death and fled into the mountains. After a few days, he returned because he could not bear the hunger, and said again that he was willing to be buried. The family prepared another feast to bid him farewell. After eating, they placed the coffin at the door and forced him into the coffin. Wang, in desperation, crawled into the coffin with tears filling his eyes. Then they covered the coffin and nailed it down. Wang, in the coffin, kept calling out, "Don't nail my head!" Everyone who heard it was terrified!

### Pudong Nanhui Implements 3-1 Rent Reduction

Big Landlords Take the Lead in Advocating Rent Only Half of Previous Years

[Nanhui, 25th] The majority of the land within a hundred square li of Pudong is arable. A majority of its 1.3 million people are farmers. Within this vast rural area, a movement has been sparked this year: "3-1 Rent Reduction," a significant event unprecedented in the past. Several large landowners have personally requested the county magistrate to announce the implementation of 3-1 rent reduction, indicating their willingness to take the lead. The largest landowners in Pudong own 1,200 mu of land. They have realized that the trend of "land to the tiller" is natural. This time, Nanjiang County first implemented the 3-1 rent reduction (Nanjiang County accounts for about half of Pudong's area). A Rent Evaluation Committee has been established, which held a meeting the other day to assess the rent levels for the entire county as follows: (1) The Shakan area, primarily producing cotton and miscellaneous grains, has a maximum rent level of 40 jin of beans per mu. (2) The Tuantian area and the area east to the Shakan area, primarily producing cotton, rice, and miscellaneous grains, have a maximum rent level of 3 dou 3 sheng of white rice per mu after the 3-1 rent reduction. (3) The Tuqu area, primarily producing cotton and rice, has a maximum rent level of 4 dou 6 sheng of white rice per mu.

Such low rent levels are unprecedented, about half or less of previous years. In the past, Tuantian had to collect over 1 shi of rice in rent; now, it only has over 4 dou, which is a great benefit for tenant farmers. Township and town tenant rent evaluation committees have now been established. The committees are composed of three landlords, three tenant farmers, and one representative each from the government, the council, and the farmers' association. Everyone unanimously advocates that they will never allow landlords with backward and conservative ideas to take control.

In addition to Nanjiang's pioneering implementation, Fengxian has also assessed a lower rent level. It is heard that other counties will also follow suit and launch the rent reduction movement.

### Major Corruption Case in Hunan Food Bureau: Secret in Green Suitcase to be Heard in Court

[Special Report from Changsha on the 27th] The corruption case of Huang Dean, the former director of the Hunan Provincial Food Bureau, involved a green suitcase containing secret documents during the prosecutor's investigation. The secrets within were not disclosed by the court during the investigation, leading to much speculation from the outside world. The so-called "secret of the green suitcase" has been widely rumored for a while. Huang's case was publicly heard for the first time on the 26th. The defendant's testimony was only completed from 9:00 am to about 9:00 pm. Other related parties will continue to be heard in court on the 27th. In Huang Dean's testimony, the "secret of the green suitcase" has been fully revealed, and the facts of the case will not be difficult to clarify.

### Order to Investigate the Food Command's Flat Price for Grain in Wuxi

[Report from Wuxi on the 26th] The Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters recently received an order from the Presidential Palace to quickly and thoroughly investigate the Wuxi County's extraction of 20% of exported grain, which was settled at 60% of the market price for a flat price, what basis it was based on, when it was implemented, and how much had been extracted up to the date of the document, and how the implementation of the 5% levy on exported food was being handled. After receiving the order, the county government stated that since the mandatory price limit policy, transportation bans and obstacles have been imposed everywhere, and everyone has been acting on their own. At that time, the Food Department and the Shanghai Civil Investigation Committee were purchasing a large amount of grain in Wuxi. For the sake of safety, the county's Flat Price Committee extracted 20% of the rice being shipped out for flat price, in order to limit the price increase. Although it knew that there was no legal basis for this and it would easily attract criticism, those who did not know the truth believed that the county was hindering grain transportation, which it deeply regretted. In addition to truthfully reporting the facts, it also requested instructions on a proper method for the future.

### Shaoxing to Hold Winter Relief

[Report from Shaoxing on the 26th] County Magistrate Lin convened gentry and merchants to establish a Winter Relief Committee in the county government on the 25th of this month and held the first meeting to discuss relief methods.

[Another Report] On the morning of the 21st, several dozen armed bandits suddenly emerged from the Zhuji area in the former Nan Chi district of the county, each carrying guns, causing trouble in the Huajie Village of Xie Jiaqiao. Our army immediately pursued and suppressed them upon receiving the report.

After being detained and sent to the local court for trial, it was clearly determined that Ren Yijun and Yang Wenzun were each sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for food and corruption. Yang Wenzun's owed tax rice was immediately recovered.

### A Second Discussion on Chinese Cuisine

— Le Zhi

The historical background of Chinese cuisine is worthy of study. In ancient times, people valued flavor, focusing on meat dishes, which retained the customs of the hunting and gathering era, and its monotony is self-evident. The artistic transformation of diet is truly a contribution of Taoism. Originally, Taoist products were the marrow of authentic Chinese culture, deeply influencing the nation's way of life, and diet is one aspect of this. The so-called "immortals gathering mushrooms" after the Qin and Han dynasties was a major advancement in diet. "Zhi" refers to fungi, including today's wood ear mushrooms, button mushrooms, fragrant herbs, and various other fungi, adding variety to flavors and benefiting health through nutrition. The ancients meticulously researched this, willing to abandon worldly affairs in pursuit of a better life, and their spirit is invaluable. By the Tang and Song dynasties, Buddhism had deeply penetrated Chinese culture, leading to great efforts in the use of bamboo shoots. Within this millennium, since Su Dongpo introduced "Jade Plate Zen" and Huang Shangu cursed the bamboo shoot not to become bamboo, a new realm was opened up. The Chinese delicacies we enjoy today still rely heavily on fungi and bamboo shoots. From this, we can see that Chinese cuisine is rich in religious art, representing both Taoism and Buddhism, reflecting the spiritual life of the higher intellectual class, harmonious and indifferent, transcending the material world, and its flavors are endlessly far-reaching. In modern times, tofu has been added. Everyone knows the benefits of tofu, so there's no need to discuss it further. Speaking of its artistic significance, its wonder lies in its neutrality. It is flavorless in itself, yet it enhances the deliciousness of other dishes and mitigates their flaws. This is another subtle point worthy of contemplation. Some people disapprove of the excessive use of tofu products in vegetarian dishes. Indeed, this is a common habit. Anything used too much or done excessively is not good. Vegetarian chefs excessively seek form and do not properly utilize natural ingredients, relying solely on tofu and gluten as treasures, which is a major reason why people are afraid to eat vegetarian dishes. This should be improved.

Around the middle of the Ming Dynasty, after maritime transportation developed, Chinese cuisine underwent another major change, which was the ascendancy of seafood. The so-called "eight treasures" commonly used in the past (which were actually just imaginative terms) were mostly mountain delicacies, with very few mentions of marine products. Only in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties did people become aware of bird's nest, shark fin, and sea cucumber. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, official banquets commonly used bird's nest and shark fin as the main dishes. However, truly grand banquets still retained the old system, using roasted meats as the main dish. When the roasted meats were served, music was played, and the chef personally knelt to present them. The honored guests would give rewards, which was a vestige of ancient customs. During the Guangxu era, ordinary people still used bird's nest and shark fin as showy dishes, without truly studying their flavors. Especially bird's nest, it was "respected but not intimate." Only in the late years did people come up with various new methods for cooking shark fin, even specializing in eating shark fin, with other dishes merely serving as an afterthought. This was a change in Chinese culture after maritime trade opened up. However, it should be noted that this way of eating shark fin has already become Sinicized, and the market for shark fin can be said to be exclusively in China. The Chinese nation's ability to assimilate the strengths of others and transform them into its own is also evidence of this.

### Lost Articles

— Xi Hou

When I was a child, my tutor taught us to read "Guan Zhi Ancient Prose," which we recited fluently, but we were quite ignorant of the content of the articles. The teacher spent a lot of effort explaining it, but we were not very interested. However, the "head-bowed and sleeping" boy in "Ode to the Autumn Sound" and the anonymous ancient musician "blowing the xiao" in "Ode to the Red Cliff" (later identified as the Taoist Yang Shichang) made us like them, as if they were very approachable. Also, when discussing "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng," the incidental mentions of how Wang Bo dreamed of the water god assisting with the wind, how he rushed to the Nine-Day Pavilion banquet, how he refused to yield at the banquet, and how his witty remarks overwhelmed the son-in-law were much more interesting to us children than "the falling glow and solitary egret fly together; the autumn water and the long sky share one hue." I remember having an idea at the time that the "draft" of that spoiled son-in-law might as well be brought out for everyone to appreciate. Since he was prepared to show off, it must not be bad. But it was eventually lost, which made me secretly feel sorry for Wu Zidan.

Also, in Old Du's "Feast for Su Duan and Xue Fu, A Song for Xue Hua When Drunk," there is a line: "In the seat, Xue Hua is good at singing drunken songs, the lyrics are self-composed and the style is old. Recently, in the world, the long poem is prominent, and you and Shandong Li Bai are well-regarded!" Could it be that Mr. Xue's "lyrics" were also overshadowed by Du Fu and were not sung among people? Every time I read this, I can't help but feel lingering fondness. Zha Taisan said: "Xue Hua's lyrics are mentioned alongside Li Bai, this old man (referring to Du Fu) is not one to give light praise, it is a pity that his poems are not passed down." I am afraid that Mr. Zha is not the only one who feels this way.

There must be no shortage of articles lost from ancient times. Modern people's collections of works are mostly self-edited, and they are added to and revised at any time, so there is no need to worry about loss.

### Inscription on Chen Xiaocui's Painting

— Pan Boying

Spring departs, leaving only deep green grass,
Kudzu vines idly caress the painted silk,
The Taoist has completed the dream of three lifetimes,
And steps on the flowering branches without a stir of the heart.

The ribbon sashes follow the guests, jade characters wide,
Human wealth and honor viewed with indifference,
A branch has already conveyed the news of spring,
The white sleeves withstand the cold wind.

As the year wanes, frozen birds struggle to sing,
Still, one sees silk stockings crossing the cold river,
High character should resemble autumn chrysanthemums and eagles,
No need for charming postures to describe Lingbo.

Standing quietly under the windy eaves, near faint fragrance,
With goods exhausted, how can one ask about the honey chamber?
In old age, I recall Wen Daizhao,
And fancifully inscribe it as Wang Lantang.

### The Failure of Confucianism

— Wu Yong

Mozi said: "Righteousness is correctness; it must follow the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior, and there is no correctness of the inferior to correct the superior." Although these are Mozi's words, they are quite sufficient to represent the paradoxical political views of the general literati and officials in my country in the past. The paradox lies in: the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior must depend on an enlightened ruler, but an enlightened ruler is something that can be encountered but not sought. If the inferior must wait for an enlightened ruler to correct them, then if there is no enlightened ruler for a hundred years, the inferior will have to remain uncorrected for a hundred years; if there is no enlightened ruler for a thousand years, the inferior will have to remain uncorrected for a thousand years. This is precisely why my country has remained uncorrected for thousands of years. Moreover, examining history, there are rare examples of the superior being able to correct the inferior. There are naturally many examples of later generations correcting previous dynasties, but when later generations become "superiors," their uncorrectness remains the same, presumably because the inferior do not correct the superior.

"Must follow the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior," to put it more simply, is the rustic's hope for a "true son of heaven." The people of Western democratic countries do not initially fantasize about "the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior," and the reason why the superior has no choice but to be correct is because the inferior can correct the superior and constantly correct them.

But thinking about the Western political thought that we have discussed for thirty or forty years, in fact, there has been no achievement to date. Is the period too short? Then, the Confucian political views that we have discussed for two or three thousand years have never been truly implemented. What is the reason for this?

In my opinion, the principles spoken by the ancient sages of my country are correct, but the methods they used are wrong. Therefore, Confucianism failed from the beginning. Confucius and Mencius both traveled to various states for a long time, seeing this ruler one moment and talking to that king the next, bustling among the feudal lords, with no time to warm their seats. One cannot say that they did not work hard to promote their doctrines, but how much progress did they make? In fact, this is the inevitable result of taking the feudal lords as the object of persuasion. Is it to ask the feudal lords to give up their vested interests? Who would be willing?

The mistake of the sages of past dynasties in my country lies in the misconception that "the correctness of the inferior must follow the correctness of the superior." Therefore, if the superior is unwilling to correct, even sages like Confucius and Mencius have no way to do anything. In addition, they failed and did not know how to change their approach, so they had no choice but to retreat and write books. At that time, if those two could clearly recognize their target audience and emulate the actions of modern Englishmen, picking a crowded place in the park every day, standing on a soapbox and lecturing the public on their doctrines, putting the time and energy spent on persuading the feudal lords into this aspect, then the history of my country over the past two or three thousand years would definitely not have been written in this way. Thinking carefully about it, the effectiveness of Confucius and Mencius persuading the feudal lords to save the world is not as good as a one-person show program that the radio station has only broadcast for a week today. Hasn't Xiao Kuaile's opinion on raising tuition fees already attracted the attention of the entire city's citizens?

Most of the people in modern China who advocated Western political thought also made the same mistake as Confucius and Mencius. We only need to check the past articles on this type of topic, and we can know that although the content is imported, the tone is still in the style of memorials, full of hope that "the superior will correct the inferior," and most of them do not seem to be written for the people to read, so the people do not want to read them.

Having a feeling about this, the author honestly and unceremoniously changed Mozi's words to "must follow the correctness of the inferior to correct the superior, and there is no correctness of the superior to correct the inferior."

### The Miserly Sir

— Qiang

Sir Harvey Ewes of Devonshire is known as the most miserly millionaire. Once, he had a niece visiting him at his home. Being inconsiderate, she was still sewing clothes by the light of a small kerosene lamp at nine o'clock at night, which made the Sir very dissatisfied.

"Put out that lamp!" Sir Ewes, who owned half a million pounds, finally couldn't bear it.

"But, uncle," his niece protested, "I need to wear that dress tomorrow! Besides, I bought the kerosene myself."

"I know, miss," the Sir said relentlessly, "but the wick burning in that lamp was bought by me!"

### Random Notes

— Xian Si

The young students of Eton College in England have always been known for their aristocratic ways. The students' "uniform hats" are all top hats. Although the children's faces are still childish, these "top hats" are full of spirit. However, recently, due to the conservation of materials, top hats have become difficult to buy, so the Eton students have had to abolish these "top hats" from now on.

There is a provision in Swedish law that all employees of any public or private institutions, banks, and shops in the country can take a two-week vacation each year, and their salaries will be paid during the vacation. Journalists and doctors are allowed to take a month off, and their salaries will be paid. This law has been implemented for ten years.

### Regarding Point Allocation Certificates

— Cheng Lu

Last year, we public educators received a point allocation certificate once. The certificate was attached with small squares such as "Heaven, Earth, Mysterious, Yellow..." Each time, one piece was torn off for use, and a small amount of American military surplus materials was allocated, such as canned candies, etc. Daily necessities were very, very few, and most of the cans, etc., were moldy. But it soon stopped, and not to mention the "Thousand Character Classic," I am afraid that only quite a few characters were used.

Okay, now point allocation certificates have been issued again. Not long ago, I went to take a look, and there were still only things that could not be eaten as meals, luxury items, or moldy canned goods. Daily necessities were still very few. But each point is only counted as ten cents, a total of 150 points per month, equivalent to 15 Gold Yuan, and you can choose yourself, so naturally you can't say "not good," and everyone still agrees. However, as soon as public educators borrowed one and a half times their salary, the price of each point immediately increased by one and a half times, to be counted as twenty-five cents. This is not all, it has also been changed to be purchased in full by each institution. Not only is it in full, but you have to listen to their reward for what things are allocated! In this way, there is a strong sense of forced purchase, even more fierce than any store!

Now we are blessed by the government, and our salaries have been increased sixfold, so naturally the price of each point will also increase sixfold, then everyone has to pay 90 Gold Yuan per month. This amount, in the eyes of us small civil servants, is a huge sum of money. I really dare not predict how many people will dare to inquire?

When the institution I serve asked for my ID number (because in addition to making a list, the ID number must also be indicated), I had resolutely given up, because I wanted to save this money and buy more rice. If all my colleagues in the city do this, the authorities can permanently treasure these treasures and sell them as antiques in the future--in fact, aren't they already antiques now!

### Skin, Helmet and Party

On the 22nd, various places began to deposit and exchange cash, on the one hand to bring the new banknotes back into circulation, and on the other hand to explain the real relationship between the new banknotes and gold and silver with facts, and restore credit, which is a supplement for the evening. On the first day in Tianjin, only one tael of gold was exchanged, and there was not much enthusiasm in Beiping either. The reason is that fixed deposits that last for a year have long been unfamiliar in the minds of the citizens. The one-year limit was originally a very ordinary "fixed term" in the normal era before the war, but in the era of economic transformation, what is taken at maturity often does not match one-tenth or even one-hundredth of what was deposited. Therefore, "fixed deposits" have not had a long term for a long time, but only one or two months, or even one week, and no one has a term of one year. At the beginning of the victory, the situation seemed to improve, but due to the situation, the economic transformation has increased without end, and the banks have no possibility of normal storage. Their advertisements to attract floating capital and attract deposits mostly compete with "short term and high interest." Everyone thinks that depositing money is not as good as storing goods. Long-term deposits are no different from abandonment. This is a habit created by history, and it cannot be completely attributed to "economic reform." However, since the accumulated mood is difficult to change suddenly, many people see "deposit one and exchange one" as no different from "exchange two for one," and the market price is about 1,500 or 1,600 Gold Yuan per tael of yellow goods, less than two numbers, so there are many people who want to get yellow goods and are willing to seek them in private markets (the situation of white goods is also the same). The official price is indeed lower than the market price, and it seems worthwhile for buyers. If the deposit is regarded as an equal part of the purchase price, then it feels higher than the market price.

Silver dollars have been the currency used throughout the country for many years, so they are different from gold banknotes. From the Qianqing era to before the Republic of China Incident, the impression of using silver dollars and copper coins in market transactions was extremely deep. Even when the "legal currency" was promoted in the 24th year of the Republic of China, it only stopped being redeemable. The so-called "yuan" on the legal currency notes specifically refers to silver dollars. The Customs Gold issued during the Anti-Japanese War and the current Gold Yuan are gold rather than silver, but the Customs Gold is still calculated according to the legal currency in the market. For example, if you sell and buy goods with 5,000 Customs Gold, you don't say 5,000 but say "100,000." The so-called 100,000 is still the legal currency, still referring to silver dollars. The Gold Yuan has no associated name with the legal currency, but at the beginning of the "economic reform," it was stipulated that two Gold Yuan are equal to one silver dollar. After the revision, ten Gold Yuan are equal to one silver dollar. The value of the Gold Yuan is even smaller than the silver dollar, so the identity of the silver dollar is more important, and the impression is more profound, so all aspects of praise and fading of edges are not accidental.

### A Second Discussion on Chinese Cuisine

— Le Zhi

The historical background of Chinese cuisine is worthy of study. In ancient times, people valued flavor, focusing on meat dishes, which retained the customs of the hunting and gathering era, and its monotony is self-evident. The artistic transformation of diet is truly a contribution of Taoism. Originally, Taoist products were the marrow of authentic Chinese culture, deeply influencing the nation's way of life, and diet is one aspect of this. The so-called "immortals gathering mushrooms" after the Qin and Han dynasties was a major advancement in diet. "Zhi" refers to fungi, including today's wood ear mushrooms, button mushrooms, fragrant herbs, and various other fungi, adding variety to flavors and benefiting health through nutrition. The ancients meticulously researched this, willing to abandon worldly affairs in pursuit of a better life, and their spirit is invaluable. By the Tang and Song dynasties, Buddhism had deeply penetrated Chinese culture, leading to great efforts in the use of bamboo shoots. Within this millennium, since Su Dongpo introduced "Jade Plate Zen" and Huang Shangu cursed the bamboo shoot not to become bamboo, a new realm was opened up. The Chinese delicacies we enjoy today still rely heavily on fungi and bamboo shoots. From this, we can see that Chinese cuisine is rich in religious art, representing both Taoism and Buddhism, reflecting the spiritual life of the higher intellectual class, harmonious and indifferent, transcending the material world, and its flavors are endlessly far-reaching. In modern times, tofu has been added. Everyone knows the benefits of tofu, so there's no need to discuss it further. Speaking of its artistic significance, its wonder lies in its neutrality. It is flavorless in itself, yet it enhances the deliciousness of other dishes and mitigates their flaws. This is another subtle point worthy of contemplation. Some people disapprove of the excessive use of tofu products in vegetarian dishes. Indeed, this is a common habit. Anything used too much or done excessively is not good. Vegetarian chefs excessively seek form and do not properly utilize natural ingredients, relying solely on tofu and gluten as treasures, which is a major reason why people are afraid to eat vegetarian dishes. This should be improved.

Around the middle of the Ming Dynasty, after maritime transportation developed, Chinese cuisine underwent another major change, which was the ascendancy of seafood. The so-called "eight treasures" commonly used in the past (which were actually just imaginative terms) were mostly mountain delicacies, with very few mentions of marine products. Only in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties did people become aware of bird's nest, shark fin, and sea cucumber. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, official banquets commonly used bird's nest and shark fin as the main dishes. However, truly grand banquets still retained the old system, using roasted meats as the main dish. When the roasted meats were served, music was played, and the chef personally knelt to present them. The honored guests would give rewards, which was a vestige of ancient customs. During the Guangxu era, ordinary people still used bird's nest and shark fin as showy dishes, without truly studying their flavors. Especially bird's nest, it was "respected but not intimate." Only in the late years did people come up with various new methods for cooking shark fin, even specializing in eating shark fin, with other dishes merely serving as an afterthought. This was a change in Chinese culture after maritime trade opened up. However, it should be noted that this way of eating shark fin has already become Sinicized, and the market for shark fin can be said to be exclusively in China. The Chinese nation's ability to assimilate the strengths of others and transform them into its own is also evidence of this.

### Lost Articles

— Xi Hou

When I was a child, my tutor taught us to read "Guan Zhi Ancient Prose," which we recited fluently, but we were quite ignorant of the content of the articles. The teacher spent a lot of effort explaining it, but we were not very interested. However, the "head-bowed and sleeping" boy in "Ode to the Autumn Sound" and the anonymous ancient musician "blowing the xiao" in "Ode to the Red Cliff" (later identified as the Taoist Yang Shichang) made us like them, as if they were very approachable. Also, when discussing "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng," the incidental mentions of how Wang Bo dreamed of the water god assisting with the wind, how he rushed to the Nine-Day Pavilion banquet, how he refused to yield at the banquet, and how his witty remarks overwhelmed the son-in-law were much more interesting to us children than "the falling glow and solitary egret fly together; the autumn water and the long sky share one hue." I remember having an idea at the time that the "draft" of that spoiled son-in-law might as well be brought out for everyone to appreciate. Since he was prepared to show off, it must not be bad. But it was eventually lost, which made me secretly feel sorry for Wu Zidan.

Also, in Old Du's "Feast for Su Duan and Xue Fu, A Song for Xue Hua When Drunk," there is a line: "In the seat, Xue Hua is good at singing drunken songs, the lyrics are self-composed and the style is old. Recently, in the world, the long poem is prominent, and you and Shandong Li Bai are well-regarded!" Could it be that Mr. Xue's "lyrics" were also overshadowed by Du Fu and were not sung among people?

I am afraid that Mr. Zha is not the only one who feels this way.

There must be no shortage of articles lost from ancient times. Modern people's collections of works are mostly self-edited, and they are added to and revised at any time, so there is no need to worry about loss.

### About Point Rationing Certificates

— Cheng Lu

Last year, we public educators received a rationing certificate once, with small squares inside marked with "Heaven, Earth, Black, Yellow..." etc. Each time, we tore off a square to use, and were allocated a small amount of surplus American military supplies, like canned goods and candies. Daily necessities were very, very few, and most of the canned goods were moldy and rotten. But soon it stopped, and of the Thousand Character Classic, not to mention a thousand characters, I'm afraid only a few scattered characters were used.

Well, now point rationing certificates have been issued again. Not long ago, I went to take a look, and they were still all things that couldn't be eaten as food, luxuries, or moldy canned goods. Daily necessities were still very few. But each point is only counted as one jiao, and the entire month's 150 points add up to fifteen gold yuan. And you can choose for yourself, so naturally you can't say it's "bad," and everyone still agrees. But as soon as public educators borrowed one and a half times their salary, the price of each point immediately increased by one and a half times, counting as two and a half jiao. That's not all, it was also changed to be purchased in full by each agency. Not only in full, but what you get allocated depends on their "generosity"! In this way, it has a strong sense of forced purchase, even fiercer than any store!

Now we are graced by the government, and our salaries have been increased sixfold. Of course, the price of each point will also increase sixfold, so each person will have to pay ninety gold yuan per month. This amount, in the eyes of us small civil servants, is a huge sum. I really dare not predict how many people will dare to inquire?

When the agency I work for asked me for my ID number (because in addition to making a list, I also had to indicate my ID number), I resolutely gave up, because I wanted to save the money and buy more rice. If all my colleagues in the city do the same, the authorities might as well treasure these treasures forever and sell them as antiques in the future – in fact, aren't they already antiques now!

### Leather Helmet Gathering

On the 22nd, deposits began to be cashed out in various places, on the one hand to bring new banknotes back into circulation, and on the other hand to explain the real connection between the new banknotes and gold and silver with facts, to restore credit. This is not a bad thing to do in one's twilight years. On the first day in Tianjin, only one tael of gold was exchanged, and the response in Beiping was also not very enthusiastic. The reason is that fixed deposits lasting up to one year have long been unfamiliar to the public. The one-year limit was originally a very common "fixed term" in the normal era before the war, but in this era of economic transformation, what you get at maturity often does not match one-tenth or even one-hundredth of what it could buy at the time of deposit. Therefore, "fixed deposits" have not had long terms for a long time, but only one or two months, or even ten days or a week. There has never been a one-year term. At the beginning of victory, the situation seemed to improve, but due to the situation, the economic transformation has only intensified. There is no possibility of normal operation for banks and stores. Their advertisements to absorb idle funds and attract deposits compete with each other with "short terms and high interest." Everyone believes that depositing money is not as good as stocking up on goods. Long-term deposits are tantamount to abandonment. This is a habit created by history and cannot be entirely blamed on "economic reform." However, since the accumulated feelings are difficult to change suddenly, many people see "depositing one and exchanging one" as no different from "exchanging two for one," and that the market price of one tael of gold is about 1500 or 1600 gold yuan, less than two numbers. Therefore, there are many people who want to obtain gold and are willing to seek it in the private market (the situation with silver is also the same). The official price is indeed lower than the market price, so it seems cost-effective for buyers. But if the deposit is considered as an equal part of the purchase price, then it feels more expensive than the market price.

Silver dollars have been the currency used nationwide for many years, so they are different from gold banknotes. From the late Qing Dynasty to before the incidents of the Republic of China, the impression of using silver dollars and copper coins in market transactions was very deep. Even when "legal tender" was promoted in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), it was only non-convertible. The so-called "yuan" on the legal tender banknotes refers to silver dollars. The customs gold issued during the Anti-Japanese War and the current gold yuan are gold rather than silver. However, customs gold was still used in the market according to the number of legal tender. For example, to buy something with 5,000 customs gold, people would not say 5,000 but "100,000." The so-called 100,000 is still legal tender and still refers to silver dollars. The gold yuan and legal tender have no connection in name, but at the beginning of the "economic reform," it was stipulated that two gold yuan were equivalent to one silver dollar. After the revision, ten gold yuan were equivalent to one silver dollar. The value of the gold yuan is less than that of the silver dollar. Therefore, the status of silver dollars is more important, and the impression is deeper. It is no coincidence that all parties are supporting it and the various relationships are fading.

### Further Discussion on Chinese Cuisine

— Le Zhi

The historical background of Chinese cuisine is worthy of research. Ancient people emphasized flavor and taste, mainly with meat dishes, not straying from the customs of the nomadic era. Its monotony is self-evident. The artisticization of diet is really a contribution of Taoism. Originally, the products of Taoism are the true essence of Chinese culture, influencing the national way of life the most, and diet is one of them. After the Qin and Han dynasties, the so-called saying of immortals gathering herbs was a major advance in diet. Herbs are fungi, including the current wood ear, mushrooms, truffles, and various fungi, which increase changes in taste and benefit nutrition in terms of health. The ancients carefully studied and did not hesitate to get rid of worldly affairs in order to seek the upward development of life, and their spirit is invaluable. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Buddhism penetrated deeply into the Chinese cultural form, so they worked hard on bamboo shoots. Within this thousand years, since Su Dongpo proposed jade-like bamboo shoots and Huang Shangu cursed bamboo shoots not to become bamboo, a new realm has been opened up. The Chinese delicacies we enjoy today still have fungi and bamboo shoots as important ingredients. From this, we can know that Chinese cuisine is rich in religious art. One represents Taoism, and one represents Buddhism, reflecting the spiritual life of the higher intellectual class, harmonious, peaceful, and transcendent, and its taste is long and endless. In modern times, tofu has been added. Everyone knows the benefits of tofu, so there is no need to talk about it again. Speaking of artistic meaning, the beauty lies in moderation. Tofu itself is tasteless, but the deliciousness of other dishes is enhanced, and the partiality of other dishes is not harmful. This is another subtle point worth exploring. Some people do not approve of too many tofu products in vegetarian dishes. Indeed, this is the habit of the common people. It is not good to use things too much or make them too much. Vegetarian cooks are too formal and do not make use of natural ingredients, relying solely on tofu and gluten as magic weapons, which is really a big reason why people are afraid to eat vegetarian dishes. This is something that should be improved.

Probably in the middle of the Ming Dynasty, after the development of maritime traffic, Chinese cuisine underwent another major change, and that is the dominance of seafood. The so-called eight treasures that used to be popular (in fact, they were just imaginary words) were mostly mountain delicacies, and very few sea delicacies were mentioned. Only in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties did people know about bird's nest, shark fin, and sea cucumber. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, official banquets generally used bird's nest and shark fin as the main dishes. However, real grand banquets still retained the old system, with barbecue as the main dish. When serving barbecue, music was played, and the chef personally knelt down to offer it. Distinguished guests were rewarded with money, which was a vestige of ancient customs. In the Guangxu years, ordinary people still used bird's nest and shark fin as facade dishes and did not really bother to study the taste, especially bird's nest, which was "respected but not close." It was not until the end of the Qing Dynasty that people came up with various new ways to cook shark fin. Even eating only shark fin, and other dishes were just leftovers. This is a change in Chinese culture after maritime trade, but it must be known that this way of eating shark fin has become Chineseized, and the market for shark fin can also be said to be exclusively in China. This is also proof that the Chinese nation can absorb the strengths of others and transform them into its own.

However, the "Autumn Sounds Fu" with the "child drooping his head and sleeping," and the "Red Cliff Fu" with the unnamed musician playing the flute (later found to be the Taoist Yang Shichang), made us like them, as if they were very approachable. Also, when talking about the "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng," the incidental mention of how Wang Bo dreamed of the water god helping with the wind, how he rushed to the Ninth Day Pavilion banquet, how he did not yield at the banquet, and how his brilliant sentences overwhelmed the son-in-law, these insertions were much more interesting to us children than "sunset and solitary birds flying together, autumn water and long sky in one color." I remember at the time that I had a thought that the "old draft" of the son-in-law might as well be taken out for everyone to enjoy. Since he was prepared to show off, it should not be bad. But it was finally lost, which made me secretly feel unfair for Wu Zi Dan.

Also, Du Fu's "Banquet at Su Duan and Xue Fu's Residence, Briefing Xue Hua's Drunken Song" has a sentence that says: "Xue Hua in the seat is good at drunken singing, the lyrics are his own and the style is old. Recently, the poems in the country are long sentences, you and Shandong Li Bai are good!" Could it be that Mr. Xue's "lyrics" were also overwhelmed by Du Fu and not sung in the world? Every time I read this, I can't help but feel nostalgic. Cha Taisun said: "Xue Hua's lyrics were mentioned alongside Li Bai, and this old man (referring to Du Fu) is not someone who praises lightly. It is a pity that his poems are not passed down." I'm afraid Mr. Cha is not the only one who feels this way.

There must be not a few articles lost from ancient times. Modern people's collections of essays are mostly self-edited and revised at any time, so there is no need to worry about loss.

### Inscription on Chen Xiaocui's Painting

— Pan Boying

Spring goes, only deep green grass remains, wisteria vines leisurely cling to the painting, the Taoist has finished his three lives dream, and treads on the flower branches without moving his heart.

The streamer from the guest's jade character is wide, and he looks at the wealth and honor of the world indifferently. A branch has already penetrated the news of spring, and the white sleeves endure the cold in the wind.

The frozen sparrows in the waning year are also difficult to sing, but you can still see the cold river passing the silk. High style should only be for autumn chrysanthemums and eagles, and there is no need to say anything about the waves.

Standing under the eaves in the wind, close to the faint fragrance, how can you ask about the honey room when the goods are extinct? When I get old, I miss Wen Daizhao, and falsely inscribe it as Wang Lantang.

### The Failure of Confucianism

— Wu Yong

Mozi said: "Justice is righteousness, it must follow the superior to correct the inferior, and there is no following the inferior to correct the superior." Although this is Mozi's words, it is quite sufficient to represent the paradoxical political view of most Chinese scholars and officials in the past. Its paradox lies in: the superior correcting the inferior must rely on a wise ruler, but a wise ruler can be encountered but not sought. If the inferior must rely on a wise ruler to correct them, then if there is no wise ruler for a hundred years, the inferior will have to be uncorrected for a hundred years, and if there is no wise ruler for a thousand years, the inferior will have to be uncorrected for a thousand years. This is precisely why our country has always been uncorrected for thousands of years. Moreover, according to history, there are few examples of the superior being able to correct the inferior. Naturally, there are many examples of later generations correcting the previous dynasties, but when later generations are the "superior," their unrighteousness is still the same. This is probably due to the inferior not correcting the superior.

"Must follow the superior to correct the inferior" can be said in simpler terms, that is, the hope of ignorant villagers for a "true Son of Heaven." The people of Western democratic countries do not vainly hope that the "superior will correct the inferior" from the beginning, but the reason why the superior has to be corrected is because the inferior can correct the superior, and correct them at all times.

But considering that we have talked about European and American political thought for thirty or forty years, in fact, we have not achieved any results to date. Is the period too short? Then we have talked about Confucian political views for two or three thousand years, but they have never been truly implemented. What is the reason?

In my opinion, the principles spoken by the ancient sages of our country are correct, but the methods they used are not correct. Therefore, Confucianism failed from the beginning. Confucius and Mencius both traveled around the various states for a long time, seeing this ruler for a while and talking to that king for a while, rushing about among the feudal lords, with no time to warm their seats. It cannot be said that they did not work hard to promote their own doctrines, but how much did they ever persuade to come out of it? In fact, this is the inevitable result of targeting the feudal lords as the object of persuasion. Is it possible to ask the feudal lords to give up their vested interests? Who would be willing?

The mistake of the sages of our country in the past dynasties was the fallacy of "must follow the superior to correct the inferior." Therefore, if the superior is unwilling to correct, even sages like Confucius and Mencius are helpless. In addition, they still do not know how to change their policies after failing, so they naturally have to retreat and write books to end it. At that time, if the two of them could recognize the object and imitate what the British have done in recent times, picking crowded places in the park every day and standing on soapboxes to give speeches to the public about their doctrines, using the time and energy of persuading the feudal lords in this area, then the history of our country for the past two or three thousand years would definitely not be written like this. Thinking carefully, the effect of Confucius and Mencius persuading the feudal lords to save the world is really not as good as a short comedy program that radio stations have only broadcast for a week today. Isn't Xiao Kuai Le's opinion on raising tuition fees already attracting the attention of the citizens of the entire city?

Most of the people who promoted Western political thought in our country in modern times also made the same mistake as Confucius and Mencius. We only need to look back at the past articles on this kind of thing to know that although the content is imported, the tone is still in the style of memorials, full of hope that the "superior will correct the inferior." Most of them do not seem to be written for the people, so the people do not want to read them.

The author feels this way, so I am honest and unceremoniously change Mozi's words to "must follow the inferior to correct the superior, and there is no following the superior to correct the inferior."

### The Stingy Sir

— Qiang

Sir Harvey Eaves of England was the most notoriously stingy wealthy man in Devon. Once, a niece was visiting him at his home, and inconsiderately, she was still sewing clothes by the light of a small kerosene lamp until nine o'clock in the evening, which made the knight deeply dissatisfied.

"Put out that lamp!" Sir Eaves, who owned half a million pounds, finally couldn't bear it anymore.

"But, uncle," his niece protested, "I need to wear that piece of clothing tomorrow! And, I bought the kerosene myself."

"I know, miss," the knight said unwillingly, "but I bought the wick that burns in that lamp!"

### East Scale, West Claw

— Xian Si

The young students of Eton College in England have always been known for their aristocracy. The students' "hats" are all high-top top hats. Although the children's faces are still immature, these "top hats" are very spirited. However, recently, due to the conservation of materials, top hats have been difficult to buy, so the students of Eton have had to cancel these "top hats" from now on.

One of Sweden's laws stipulates that all employees of public and private institutions, banks, and stores in the country can rest for two weeks each year, with their salaries paid during the holidays. And news reporters and doctors are allowed to rest for a month, with their salaries paid. This law has been in effect for ten years.

### About Point Rationing Certificates

— Cheng Lu

Last year, we public educators received a rationing certificate once, with small squares inside marked with "Heaven, Earth, Black, Yellow..." etc. Each time, we tore off a square to use, and were allocated a small amount of surplus American military supplies, like canned goods and candies. Daily necessities were very, very few, and most of the canned goods were moldy and rotten. But soon it stopped, and of the Thousand Character Classic, not to mention a thousand characters, I'm afraid only a few scattered characters were used.

Well, now point rationing certificates have been issued again. Not long ago, I went to take a look, and they were still all things that couldn't be eaten as food, luxuries, or moldy canned goods. Daily necessities were still very few. But each point is only counted as one jiao, and the entire month's 150 points add up to fifteen gold yuan. And you can choose for yourself, so naturally you can't say it's "bad," and everyone still agrees. But as soon as public educators borrowed one and a half times their salary, the price of each point immediately increased by one and a half times, counting as two and a half jiao. That's not all, it was also changed to be purchased in full by each agency. Not only in full, but what you get allocated depends on their "generosity"! In this way, it has a strong sense of forced purchase, even fiercer than any store!

Now we are graced by the government, and our salaries have been increased sixfold. Of course, the price of each point will also increase sixfold, so each person will have to pay ninety gold yuan per month. This amount, in the eyes of us small civil servants, is a huge sum. I really dare not predict how many people will dare to inquire?

When the agency I work for asked me for my ID number (because in addition to making a list, I also had to indicate my ID number), I resolutely gave up, because I wanted to save the money and buy more rice. If all my colleagues in the city do the same, the authorities might as well treasure these treasures forever and sell them as antiques in the future – in fact, aren't they already antiques now!

### Leather Helmet Gathering

On the 22nd, deposits began to be cashed out in various places, on the one hand to bring new banknotes back into circulation, and on the other hand to explain the real connection between the new banknotes and gold and silver with facts, to restore credit. This is not a bad thing to do in one's twilight years. On the first day in Tianjin, only one tael of gold was exchanged, and the response in Beiping was also not very enthusiastic. The reason is that fixed deposits lasting up to one year have long been unfamiliar to the public. The one-year limit was originally a very common "fixed term" in the normal era before the war, but in this era of economic transformation, what you get at maturity often does not match one-tenth or even one-hundredth of what it could buy at the time of deposit. Therefore, "fixed deposits" have not had long terms for a long time, but only one or two months, or even ten days or a week. There has never been a one-year term. At the beginning of victory, the situation seemed to improve, but due to the situation, the economic transformation has only intensified. There is no possibility of normal operation for banks and stores. Their advertisements to absorb idle funds and attract deposits compete with each other with "short terms and high interest." Everyone believes that depositing money is not as good as stocking up on goods. Long-term deposits are tantamount to abandonment. This is a habit created by history and cannot be entirely blamed on "economic reform." However, since the accumulated feelings are difficult to change suddenly, many people see "depositing one and exchanging one" as no different from "exchanging two for one," and that the market price of one tael of gold is about 1500 or 1600 gold yuan, less than two numbers. Therefore, there are many people who want to obtain gold and are willing to seek it in the private market (the situation with silver is also the same). The official price is indeed lower than the market price, so it seems cost-effective for buyers. But if the deposit is considered as an equal part of the purchase price, then it feels more expensive than the market price.

Silver dollars have been the currency used nationwide for many years, so they are different from gold banknotes. From the late Qing Dynasty to before the incidents of the Republic of China, the impression of using silver dollars and copper coins in market transactions was very deep. Even when "legal tender" was promoted in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), it was only non-convertible. The so-called "yuan" on the legal tender banknotes refers to silver dollars. The customs gold issued during the Anti-Japanese War and the current gold yuan are gold rather than silver. However, customs gold was still used in the market according to the number of legal tender. For example, to buy something with 5,000 customs gold, people would not say 5,000 but "100,000." The so-called 100,000 is still legal tender and still refers to silver dollars. The gold yuan and legal tender have no connection in name, but at the beginning of the "economic reform," it was stipulated that two gold yuan were equivalent to one silver dollar. After the revision, ten gold yuan were equivalent to one silver dollar. The value of the gold yuan is less than that of the silver dollar. Therefore, the status of silver dollars is more important, and the impression is deeper. It is no coincidence that all parties are supporting it and the various relationships are fading.
