### Chairman Chiang's Opening Address: Grasping the Key Points, Understanding the Future of Constitutional Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Chairman Chiang delivered an address at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly on the morning of the 29th. The key points are as follows: (1) The purpose of the National Revolution is to build China into a Three Principles of the People nation: of the people, by the people, and for the people. However, internal and external troubles have arisen repeatedly, hindering the implementation of democratic constitutionalism. The history of revolutionary nation-building is filled with hardship, difficulty, sacrifice, and struggle. The Constitution of the Republic of China is a crystallization of blood and tears. Having established the Constitution, we must eliminate obstacles and guarantee the success of constitutional government. (2) The Constitution can be divided into three major parts: first, the rights and obligations of the people; second, the political organization of the state; and third, the basic policies of the state. These three parts constitute the content of "of the people, by the people, and for the people." The foundation of the Principle of People's Sovereignty lies in the nation, and the purpose of the Principle of People's Sovereignty is democracy. We should grasp this key point to understand the future of Chinese constitutionalism. (3) According to the provisions of the Outline of National Reconstruction, after the National Assembly holds the general election, the National Government will transfer authority to the elected government, thus completing the great task of nation-building. But what is the biggest obstacle to our nation-building? The Communist Party opposes the Constitution and opposes the National Assembly that implements constitutional government, willingly becoming a sinner against democracy. To ensure the success of constitutional government, we must make every effort to suppress the rebellion. (4) This National Assembly is the first session under the Constitution. The Constitution has just been implemented, and the advantages and disadvantages have not yet been specifically experienced for reference in amendments. Therefore, the mission of the Assembly is only to exercise the right to vote to complete the organization of the government of the Republic of China. Each sacred vote cast by each representative represents the people. The responsibility of protecting the people's freedom, implementing basic national policies, and safeguarding the territorial sovereignty of the Republic of China has been entrusted to the constitutional government. I wish the Assembly success. (Full text published on page 2)

### Premier Zhang Expresses Feelings After Attending National Assembly Opening Ceremony; Delighted that the Nation's New Destiny is Beginning

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] After the National Assembly opening ceremony, our reporter approached Premier Zhang Qun and asked for his feelings. Zhang repeatedly said, "Very happy, very happy." He also stated that the task of the transition government he leads is nearing completion, and the transition government will end when the new government is established.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun attended the opening ceremony of the National Assembly as a representative. After the meeting, when asked by reporters, he expressed his feelings, saying: Since the government was reorganized and its foundation expanded last April, it has actively promoted the work of implementing the Constitution. During this period, it encountered many difficulties and obstacles. Thanks to the unity of the people and the government, and the cooperation of various political parties, the National Assembly has opened on schedule today, which is a great event for the country. The task of the Executive Yuan after the reorganization was to serve as a bridge from political tutelage to constitutional government during this transitional period. In the past eleven months, precisely during a difficult and turbulent time, the Executive Yuan's measures have been diligent, but the effects have not been as expected, and it deeply feels inadequate to meet the eager expectations of the people. However, in the preparatory process for the implementation of constitutional government, the work that the Executive Yuan should undertake has fortunately been largely completed. After the start of constitutional government, the burden of the Executive Yuan during this transitional period will be lifted, and the nation's new destiny will begin. My joy is not limited to personal feelings alone.

### Zeng Qi's Remarks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the China Youth Party, issued a statement after attending the opening ceremony of the National Assembly, saying: "The Republic of China was founded 37 years ago, and only this year do we have a formal Constitution and the establishment of a formal popular opinion institution. And a popularly elected government will be generated according to the Constitution. This is the first step for the country to enter "modernization" and "democratization." The results of the arduous efforts in the past are due to the country having wise leaders, the people having a unified demand, various parties and factions and social elites having a common will, working together, united in purpose, fighting hard, not swayed by superficial opinions, and not disheartened by internal strife, and then can we enter the constitutional stage. How should we value this grand event? I hope that the members of the National Assembly will act in accordance with the powers granted by the Constitution, based on the principle of "selecting the virtuous and capable," treat it seriously, elect the President and Vice President to lead the people, promote constitutional government, and establish a formal "popularly elected government" with broad "inclusiveness" and "constructive power" to deal with a group of troublemakers who are fond of making trouble, who have "international backing," and who use force as a tool for political struggle. Before the Second National Assembly, we should strive to create a nation of universal welfare, so as not to fail the sacred mission entrusted to us by the people."

### National Assembly Representatives' Concessions Dispute Comes to an End

Occupiers of the venue withdrew yesterday morning

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The issue of signed National Assembly representatives has been gradually resolved in part. The ten representatives who intended to occupy the assembly hall and demonstrate with a hunger strike on the 28th, after several hours of persuasion by Zhang Lisheng, Hong Lanyou, Chen Lifu and others, left the venue at around 4:00 AM on the 29th and have now moved to the Fifth National Assembly Hostel. Subsequently, after the efforts of Yu Bin, Mo Dehui, Hu Shih and others, and a decision to study the matter further as a remedy, Chairman Chiang summoned the hunger-striking representatives at 4:30 PM on the 29th and reiterated his views on the issue of concessions, believing that two points were worthy of consideration: (1) Regarding the concession of women's groups, there was a misunderstanding that the sixth-place delegate should concede instead of the fifth-place delegate. This point can be considered; (2) Representatives from re-election constituencies can also be considered. As for the decision of the party to concede to the party, the Chairman solemnly stated that it could not be changed, even if he would not be the first president, he could not change it. By 7:30 PM, three of the representatives, including Li Luojiu, were willing to concede on the spot and immediately resigned and returned to the Fifth Hostel. Yu Bin again persuaded them to eat, and the representatives reluctantly ate an orange. The signed representatives then reconvened and sent representatives of the statutory faction to express their condolences. As for Ma Wenyuan, who had been resolved, he also reported to the registration office at around 9:00 PM in the evening.

### Washington Business Circles Rumor that Kong Xiangxi Will Rise Again; Possible Return to Country to Hold Important Position

[Associated Press, New York, 28th] It is widely rumored in American business circles here that Kong Xiangxi, China's wartime Premier, may return to China to hold an important position. Some business and diplomatic circles believe that the report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Chinese government, which was withdrawn by Vandenberg, stated that the position of the Chinese government had deteriorated considerably after the war, referring to the fact that Kong Xiangxi's departure from the government had a significant impact on the government.

It is not yet known what position Kong Xiangxi will hold, but it is pointed out that he was the Deputy Premier during the war, when Chairman Chiang himself devoted himself to military affairs, and the entire administrative responsibility was entrusted to Kong.

According to the task of the Assembly, which is to elect the President and Vice President, the nomination announcement of the President and Vice President each requires three days, a total of six days of announcement time. They specifically suggest that the Assembly take advantage of this opportunity to hold a current affairs review meeting, in which representatives from all units across the country and overseas can elaborate on the sufferings of the people, review the gains and losses of military, political, and economic conditions in various places, so as to contribute to the suppression of rebellion and the building of the country, and enable the government after the reorganization to understand the people's suffering and gain reference in policy implementation. The representatives also said that the convening of this National Assembly costs unlimited talent and financial resources. If it does not make substantial contributions, it will not be able to comfort the expectations of the people across the country. Therefore, after this news spread, representatives from all provinces and cities unanimously agreed and placed great expectations on it.

### A New Page in Chinese History

Special Dispatch from This Newspaper (Nanjing, March 29th)

"The convocation of the National Assembly is the most important event in thirty-seven years."

Chairman Chiang said this in his opening address at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly. The convening of the National Assembly, leading the country into a constitutional era, and the return of government to the people by the National Government is the ultimate goal advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in his National Revolution. The achievement of this goal is indeed the most important event in the thirty-seven years of the Republic of China. However, to broaden the scope, the convocation and implementation of the constitution by this first National Assembly is also a brand new page in the five thousand years of Chinese history. Let us see how this page is written in such a solemn and glorious manner.

Thirty-seven years ago, on March 29th, the revolutionaries of the Chinese Kuomintang failed in the Guangzhou Uprising. However, this failure in spring laid the foundation for the success in autumn. The revolutionary martyrs threw their heads, spilled their fresh blood, to strive for the realization of their ideals, which finally became apparent to the world thirty-seven years later. The selection of March 29th as the opening day of the first National Assembly is of great significance. When Chairman Chiang led all the national representatives to pay respects at the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation and to offer sacrifices to the revolutionary martyrs, the fallen soldiers, and the deceased compatriots, it reminded people of the countless internal and external troubles in the course of the National Revolution and recalled the corpses, blood, and sweat on the way. It further highlighted the heavy burden of democracy recorded on those two occasions.

The 29th was blessed with Nanjing's best weather this year. From midnight to dawn, messengers from the National Assembly Preparatory Committee sequentially knocked on the doors of every representative and every hotel, rushing to deliver notices for the 9 o'clock visit to the mausoleum, the 10 o'clock spring sacrifice, and the 11 o'clock opening ceremony. The night mist slowly rose, and the bright stars disappeared into the increasingly dense fog. Around 8 o'clock, nearly a thousand cars, large and small, sped through the mausoleum area. People surged onto the stone plaza and steps of the Father of the Nation's mausoleum like a rising tide. Approaching 9 o'clock, the sunlight suddenly broke through the heavy fog, precisely allowing the good news of the implementation of the constitution to be brought to the spirits of the Father of the Nation and the martyrs in a gentle breeze and bright sunshine. The new page of Chinese history was also revealed under the reflection of the blue sky and white sun.

Around 11 o'clock, the National Assembly no longer had the usual desolation of the past year. The rows of cars flowed continuously in front of the illuminated sign decorated with neon lights that read "Long Live the Republic of China." People wearing silk ribbons of various colors talked and laughed as they stepped into the gate of the assembly hall, where the national flag gleamed and the red light letters "The World is for All" shone above the door. In the corridor, directly in front were two registration desks for the representatives, and on both sides were signature areas for guests, government leaders, and foreign guests. The post office and telecommunications bureau were still staffed by the same old people who had served during the preparations for the National Assembly. The three large vermilion gates with gold trim at the front of the assembly hall were wide open, and the couplets gilded with "To Establish the Republic" and "To Advance Together" looked even more magnificent. Upon entering the venue, the mercury lamps illuminated the stage and most of the assembly hall. In the center of the backdrop on the stage was a large national flag, flanked by two gilded models of the constitution and bas-reliefs of auspicious millet. In front of the flag stood an oil painting of the Father of the Nation, accompanied by potted cypresses on both sides. Further in front was a long table with a vase of fresh flowers on display. Near the front of the stage was the chairman's desk, and on both sides of the stage were two large national flags. In addition, the venue was decorated everywhere with national flags, silver-painted models of the constitution, and auspicious millet designs in various sizes. The blue, white, and red colors reflected the lights on the milk-colored walls, showcasing a scene of splendor, solemnity, dignity, and auspiciousness. In such a venue, the writing of a new page in Chinese history began. The downstairs was filled with male and female representatives, and the upstairs was occupied by deputy ministers from various ministries, Chinese and foreign guests, and standing committee members from the Nationalist, Youth, and Democratic Socialist parties. At 11:30, the opening ceremony began amidst melodious music. Chairman Chiang delivered the opening address, and after the elderly Mr. Wu Zhihui led the representatives in taking the oath, the ceremony concluded amidst music.

The first National Assembly has finally opened. On this day shining with the glory of the revolution‚ÄîMarch 29th‚Äîlooking back on the days before the opening, it was truly like the heavy fog that filled the night and morning. As the rituals and music of the opening ceremony began and ended, people once again saw the joy of the blue sky and white sun breaking through the fog. The attending representatives were naturally delighted, as were the officials who handled the elections and preparatory affairs, and the officials responsible for the transitional governance before the implementation of the constitution. During the days of gloom, the resolution of election disputes, the choices of politics and laws, and the discussions on the seats for party representatives heavily weighed on people's minds, requiring painstaking resolution. Several key officials were busy and tired until late at night, but ultimately relied on Chairman Chiang's appeal, the Kuomintang's discipline, the individual sacrifices of Kuomintang members, and the sincere cooperation of the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties to resolve all existing problems. China's implementation of the constitution is not only a new page in Chinese history but also a major event in the democratic world. The diplomatic envoys of various countries in Nanjing, led by French Ambassador Mr. Meyrier (the senior ambassador of the Nanjing diplomatic corps), attended the ceremony with joy and in full dress. France is the country of origin of democracy, and Ambassador Meyrier felt very honored to be able to participate in the ceremony and sit in the first seat in the foreign guests' section. He praised the development of democracy in China to the utmost. American Ambassador Dr. Stuart said that this was an unprecedented event and that the National Assembly, as a democratic institution, would bring benefits to the Chinese people. British Ambassador Sir Steven repeatedly said, "Good, of course good." Indian Ambassador Mr. Menon, who was about to return to his country, was even more pleased to be able to attend this grand event before his departure, and he shook hands tightly with reporters.

"Wonderful! I am extremely happy. I hope China's democratic government can work hard to achieve national stability."

The first National Assembly has opened. Under the world's attention, the new page of Chinese history has been smoothly written and is being solemnly written down. Standing from the people's perspective, we wish the assembly success, because the success of the assembly is the success of the people, and Chinese history has begun another new era.

### Editorial: Cultivation of Reason and Will

Yesterday was the 5th Youth Day. All sectors of the city held grand celebrations, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Everyone who participated in the celebrations placed all of China's hopes on the youth. However, when we calm down and think about it, we find that many of today's youth exhibit emotions of bewilderment and restlessness, and a sense of turbulence and chaos, making it difficult to see again the spirit of enthusiasm, courage, and perseverance that characterized the revolutionary struggles and the War of Resistance against Japan. We certainly do not want to be overly critical of the youth, but we are extremely sympathetic to their distress. Therefore, we are eager to take this opportunity to analyze the main causes of their problems and offer a word to intellectual youth, hoping that the youth of the whole country will, from today onwards, resolutely concentrate their energies on the cultivation of reason and will. In his letter to the youth of the country, Chairman Chiang also said: "First, young people should carefully examine and discern, and clearly recognize the enemies of the nation. Young people should have passionate emotions, and at the same time, they should have rich reason."

The contradictions and turmoil of the times, and the social unrest that occurred after the War of Resistance, seem to be the main causes of anxiety for the well-meaning youth. However, these factors are the same for all aspects of society. Looking at the changing international situation and the unrecovered wounds of war, there is also economic recession in Western countries. Why is the expression of distress and anxiety among Chinese intellectual youth particularly serious?

Young people are particularly rich in emotions, so they are easily enthusiastic and easily disappointed; they can be guided to do good and accomplish things, but they can also easily deviate and act rashly. In Chinese society, where the level of knowledge is low and organizational strength is weak, emotions are even more likely to run wild and fail to be properly directed. After the May Fourth Movement, the youth were liberated from the old ethics, and a surge of vigorous enthusiasm did indeed have the effect of promoting social progress. However, our imitation of European and American new education generally focuses on form and "interest," while neglecting the "will training" that China has always valued, and has not fulfilled the "cultivation of reason" achieved by Western culture since Greece, which is the so-called tradition of "love of wisdom" and "seeking truth." Therefore, our youth's emotions have been developed, but they have no way to be expanded and purified. Once they encounter dissatisfaction or resistance in life, their emotions lose their moorings, and two tendencies easily occur: the cautious become depressed and decadent due to disappointment, and the sharp-minded become restless and reckless due to stronger feelings of resentment. The basic reason for the lack of vitality among the majority of today's youth, and the reckless and unconventional behavior of some young students, lies here.

To reverse the decline and bewilderment of the youth, and to prevent them from going astray, laws, punishments, or formal moral training are no longer sufficient. We must devote ourselves to the cultivation of "reason" and the tempering of "will" in education and in the youth's self-training.

First, let us talk about the cultivation of reason: China's current school education, especially the university education that imitates European and American systems, originally focused on imparting reason. Although the university tutorial system is well-intentioned, its effectiveness has not been significant to this day. In recent years, many educators have believed that the mission of modern universities should be centered on "reason," and have questioned the need to take into account moral training. We believe that if the training of morality must be taken into account at the middle school stage to supplement the education of knowledge and ability, then higher education, if it can truly implement the education of "reason," will naturally be sufficient to complete the entire personality education, because blind obedience and reckless action are mostly due to a failure to understand the principles of things: if there is genuine insight, it can naturally develop into great benevolence and great courage. However, unfortunately, precisely this training of reason, such as the ability to use thought, carefully judge, and distinguish right from wrong, is generally felt to be lacking within the walls of today's schools. They often lightly believe what they hear from rumors, and act rashly because of light belief; or they are muddled and indecisive, or they hesitate and watch from the sidelines. The Confucian scholars of the past taught us the method of investigating things to extend knowledge, the so-called "extensive learning, careful questioning, prudent thinking, and clear discrimination," which focused precisely on "thinking" and "discrimination"; unfortunately, today's intellectual youth are the least good at using reason to think and to discriminate. We only need to look at the causes of the recent university student movements, which are often that a small number of people have a set of training for their aims and are brave enough to cause trouble, so that the majority are timid and afraid to do good. The confusion of the power of rational thinking can be said to be the main cause of the chaos in education and the social environment. Young people should think: the failure of the country's politics to get on the right track is precisely because the distinction between right and wrong is not clear; if the habit of light belief, the superficial attitude, and the acts of attacking and insulting become the fashion of intellectual youth, then how can politics be clear in the future, and how can democracy be realized? Understanding this, young people should know the importance of establishing the foundation of thinking and discernment with "reason."

Secondly, the tempering of will is complementary to the education of reason. The Chinese sages taught people to place the greatest emphasis on setting goals. The so-called "upholding aspirations" and "encouraging aspirations" are actually efforts to strengthen and refine after seeing the principles clearly. If one's aspirations are not firm, then one can only see the current phenomena, but not the distant and grand aspects. One cannot withstand setbacks, and one can easily fail to achieve success. The great achievements of many great men in history are due to the teachings of their loyal and long-suffering mothers; the outstanding achievements of many scholars originate from the arduous efforts of poor scholars; the repelling of enemies and the expansion of territory by many famous generals are based on the unwavering spirit of courage. This is clear evidence that will can generate great power. Young people are rich in years and strength, and their future is bright. If they have reason to establish their foundation, they must use their will to achieve their goals. All those who lack patience and are easily disappointed, lack perseverance and are sporadic in their efforts, are lenient in blaming themselves and harsh in blaming others, and only know how to benefit themselves but cannot benefit the group, are all signs that they understand the principles but their will is insufficient. Only the youth with the most abundant willpower can avoid negativity, avoid inconsistency, avoid being cowards, and not be "hypocrites." By extension, they can "act courageously for what is right" and can easily achieve the state of "riches cannot corrupt, poverty cannot move, and might cannot subdue."

In analyzing the uneasy emotions of today's intellectual youth, we naturally cannot ignore the factors of the times. However, past education, imitating England and the United States, only liberated the emotions of the youth; and while imparting knowledge, it failed to temper their ability to think and discern, which is indeed a major factor. Only by understanding reason can we guide the emotions of the youth onto the right track, and only by encouraging will can we refine the emotions and reason of the youth and lead them to action. The work of correcting imbalances and rescuing shortcomings in the future depends on the efforts of educators in general; but striving to be better, and doing one's best, aspiring youth will not want to blame heaven and others, but can examine their gains and losses, and make painful efforts in the direction of "understanding reason" and "encouraging will."

Those who are knowledgeable are not confused, those who are benevolent are not worried, and those who are courageous are not afraid. Benevolence is the full-person realm of the moral cultivation of the Confucian scholars of the past, and knowledge and courage are at least what our youth can learn and approach. In today's changing world, in order to seek a way to stand on one's own feet and serve the country, we must deeply establish reason, so that we will not be confused by the chaotic phenomena; we must establish will, so that we will not be afraid of the threats of all external forces. Without confusion and without fear, we will naturally have the determination to deal with chaos and the power to adapt to changes. What need is there for depression and anxiety?

The newspaper also predicted that the president elected by the National Assembly in accordance with the Constitution would undoubtedly be Chairman Chiang, and said that Chairman Chiang led China through the Great War and internal strife.

In order to invite the various minority parties to participate in the government, Chairman Chiang agreed to give these parties a number of representatives that exceeded what they should have according to their strength. To this end, he had to restrain the Kuomintang members from running for election so that the various minority parties could have enough representatives elected to meet the agreed number.

### Full Text of the Chairman's Address at the National Assembly Opening Ceremony

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The National Assembly News Group reports: Chairman Chiang delivered an address at the opening ceremony of the First National Assembly, First Session, on the morning of the 29th. The full text is as follows:

Today, our First National Assembly is convening. All of you have come from various regions, entrusted by voters nationwide, to exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution. This marks the beginning of democratic constitutionalism in the Republic of China. It is also the goal that the Father of the Nation sought to achieve through over fifty years of sacrifice and struggle in leading the National Revolution. Today's gathering is not only a major event in the history of the Republic of China but truly a landmark event in Chinese history. I am deeply gratified to be able to participate in this sacred and solemn celebration.

Cherish the Value of the Constitution, Remove Obstacles to Democracy

The purpose of the National Revolution is to rescue China from peril, to seek freedom and equality for China, and to build China into a Republic of the Three Principles of the People: of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is also the shared responsibility of all representatives today. The Father of the Nation once said, "The so-called Republic should not concern itself with the name of the Republic but with the reality of sovereignty residing in the people." The Father of the Nation also said, "The meaning of the Three Principles of the People is government of the people, ownership by the people, and enjoyment by the people. The country is owned by the people, politics is managed by the people, and benefits are shared by the people." To thoroughly realize this great ideal, the Outline of National Reconstruction was established to awaken the national people to struggle together. However, in the thirty-seven years since the founding of the Republic, internal and external troubles have arisen one after another. Initially, there were remnants of the imperial system and warlords from the Northern Warlords who usurped the country. Then there was the invasion of Japanese imperialism. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we encountered the rebellion of the Communist bandits, who deliberately subverted the Republic of China and implemented the dictatorship of the "mob." These reactionary forces have all exerted their full power to obstruct the implementation of our democratic constitutionalism. Our history of revolution and nation-building can be said to be filled with a history of arduous struggles and sacrifices. The Constitution of the Republic of China, which we promulgated last year, can be said to be the crystallization of blood and tears. In the past, we have broken through layers of resistance and overcome various difficulties to produce this Constitution. In the future, we must cherish the value of the Constitution, remove obstacles to democracy, and ensure the success of constitutionalism.

Not to Emphasize the Beauty of the Articles, But in the Complete Implementation

The constitutionalism of all countries in the world has gradually developed, improved, and enriched itself to reach a state of perfection. The Constitution does not emphasize the beauty of the articles but the complete implementation. The Constitution of the Republic of China can be mainly divided into three parts: first, the rights and obligations of the people; second, the political organization of the state; and third, the basic policies of the state. These three parts also constitute the content of ownership by the people, government by the people, and enjoyment by the people. Only when the people have the ability and habit to exercise political power, understand the value of the people's rights and freedoms, and fulfill their obligations to the state can the foundation of the state be firmly guaranteed, and the state can become a state owned by the people. Only when a close and full relationship is established between the people and the government, allowing the people to have power and the government to have ability, and jointly following the path of the Constitution, can the political organization of the state fulfill its proper function and become a tool for promoting national policy. Only by formulating basic national policies in accordance with the interests of the entire people and the entire country can the people strive to pursue a common ideal to achieve progress and prosperity. These three parts are closely related and inseparable. The history of constitutional development in all countries of the world has proven that political democracy cannot be separated from national independence, nor can it be separated from the happiness of the people. As far as China is concerned, the basis of the Principle of Democracy lies in the Principle of Nationalism, and the purpose of the Principle of Democracy lies in the Principle of People's Livelihood. The history of China's democratic movement is first to strive for the independence and equality of the nation and ultimately to guarantee the rights of the people and enrich the lives of the people. If you grasp this key point to understand the future of our country's constitutionalism, you will find that the political measures after the implementation of the Constitution must aim at realizing basic national policies, must be based on improving the lives of the entire people, and must also be based on guaranteeing national survival and the foundation of the state.

To Ensure the Success of Constitutionalism, We Must Exert All Efforts to Suppress the Rebellion

According to the provisions of the Father of the Nation's Outline of National Reconstruction, after the promulgation of the Constitution, a national election will be held, and the National Government will transfer power to a government elected by the people, marking the completion of the great task of nation-building. However, our implementation of constitutionalism today, in terms of economic construction, in terms of social construction, and in terms of cultural and educational construction, can only be said that the work of nation-building has a basic foundation and can make further efforts with national policies as a guideline, but it cannot be said that nation-building has been successfully completed. Representatives of voters from all regions must recognize what is the biggest obstacle to our nation-building and what is the biggest obstacle to our democratic constitutionalism. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, we have been working hard on reconstruction, while the Communist bandits have been destroying and obstructing everywhere. At the same time, we have been actively preparing to convene the National Assembly and the work of drafting the Constitution, while the Communist bandits initially restrained, then refused, and finally openly rebelled. Last year, after we promulgated the Constitution, the Communist bandits believed that once China implemented democratic constitutionalism, they would not be able to implement their so-called class dictatorship of selling out the country and harming the nation. Therefore, they brazenly opposed the Constitution and the National Assembly, and they willingly became enemies of democracy and enemies of the country, launching a more insane armed rebellion and a more cruel massacre and destruction. Today, we begin to implement constitutionalism to plan for the long-term security of the country, while what the Communist bandits want is chaos. We want to protect the lives of the people and the survival of the nation, while what the Communist bandits want to create is hunger, poverty, and destruction. Therefore, I believe that today the state and the people should attach equal importance to suppressing the rebellion and implementing constitutionalism. We will not delay the implementation of constitutionalism because of suppressing the rebellion. On the contrary, we must exert all efforts to suppress the rebellion to remove this obstacle to nation-building and the enemy of democracy because we want to ensure the success of constitutionalism. Representatives, after examining the current situation of the country, will surely have the same profound recognition.

The Mission of This Assembly Is to Exercise the Right to Elect

This National Assembly is the first assembly after the implementation of the Constitution. The Constitution has just been implemented, and there is no concrete experience to provide reference for modification. Therefore, the mission of this assembly is only to exercise the right to elect to complete the organization of the government of the Republic of China. According to the spirit of our Constitution, the responsibility of the constitutional government is to protect the freedom of the people and implement basic national policies, and its most important task is to maintain our democratic republic system, maintain national sovereignty, and restore territorial integrity. Representatives, in exercising your powers in the assembly, each sacred vote cast by each representative represents the people of the Republic of China, entrusting the responsibility of protecting the freedom of the people and implementing basic national policies, as well as the responsibility of maintaining the democratic republic system and maintaining national sovereignty, to the constitutional government. At the same time, it also means entrusting the responsibility of removing obstacles to democracy and eliminating obstacles to nation-building to the constitutional government. Today's suppression of the rebellion is a war of democratic constitutionalism against the dictatorship of the mob, and it is also a war of saving the country against betraying the country, and saving the people against harming the people. At such a critical moment, and at the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, the responsibilities of the people and the constitutional government are particularly important. I sincerely hope that the representatives will understand the true needs of the country and the people, faithfully express the will of the people, solemnly exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution, and establish a good foundation for the beginning of constitutionalism. I wish the assembly success.

More than 30 People Captured, Currently Under Interrogation

### Beiping Garrison Headquarters Cracks Down on a Pro-Communist Propaganda Organ

More than 30 People Captured, Currently Under Interrogation

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] Around the Lunar New Year this year, many organizations and groups in this city, as well as prominent social figures, received New Year's cards signed "Beiping Liberation Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army." Subsequently, even more absurd statements with the aforementioned signature were received, such as "New Year's Message to Beiping Workers" and "Warning to the People of Beiping" signed by the "Investigation Team for War Criminals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," but the printed paper was extremely crude, and some were mimeographed. The Investigation Department of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters recently cracked down on the entire organization, seizing on the spot the seals and stamps used for the aforementioned documents, the complete mimeograph machine, and the copied cards and propaganda materials, as well as various pro-Communist books. It is reported that more than 30 people have been arrested in this case and have been sent to the Investigation Department for interrogation. The interrogation is being intensified around the clock to ensure that no one is wrongly accused and that no one escapes justice. Details will be announced soon. Technical Issues Still Under Discussion

### Strengthening Anti-Smuggling Between Guangdong and Hong Kong

Technical Issues Still Under Discussion

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] It is reported that in order to expedite the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, the authorities have transferred 20 customs officers from Qingdao and reorganized the Kowloon Customs personnel. There are also plans to establish a customs checkpoint in Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong, to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts. It is reported that on the technical issues, the Hong Kong side still insists that it should account for 40% of the proceeds from the sale of smuggled goods seized in Hong Kong's Jinghai, but all anti-smuggling personnel and customs checkpoint expenses are to be borne entirely by our side. This is tantamount to increasing our burden, while the Hong Kong side is increasing a large amount of treasury tax revenue. Therefore, this issue is still under discussion.

### Hong Kong Currency Circulating in South China, Authorities Seriously Cracking Down

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Regarding the circulation of Hong Kong currency in South China, which hinders our country's currency, the Ministry of Finance reports: due to the convenient transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, Hong Kong currency has previously circulated in Guangzhou, Shantou, and other nearby areas. In recent years, the exchange rate of Hong Kong currency against our national currency has been rising, and the public has been storing more Hong Kong currency. Guangzhou even sells goods at Hong Kong currency prices, which has hindered our country's currency. The Guangzhou Financial Administration has been cracking down on this seriously, and it has been improving day by day. Except that there is no clear written law to crack down on the public's storage of Hong Kong currency, the import and export of foreign currency is limited to 100 US dollars in accordance with the Bank of China's regulations on foreign exchange management. As for the use of gold banknotes for transactions, they should be confiscated in accordance with the regulations on the management and punishment of gold and foreign currency trading. These all have legal restrictions and crackdowns. Given time, considerable results can be achieved.

### Correction and Apology

Yesterday, the news "Two Female Youths in Guangzhou Sign Up to Volunteer for the Army" in the eleventh column of this edition, the last two lines "sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for two years" should have been attached to the end of the news "Taixian Investigates the Case, Xu Jihua Sentenced to Five Years." In the news "‚Ä¶Xu Jihua sentenced to five years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for three years," the four words "Wang Xiaosu sentenced" were also omitted. (The original text should be: "...Xu Jihua sentenced to five years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for three years, Wang Xiaosu sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for two years.") We apologize for the inquiries by telephone or letter from readers and hereby make a solemn correction.

### Li Zongren First to Announce Candidacy for Vice President Li Zongren

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] General Li Zongren's participation in the vice-presidential election can be considered a vanguard. While factions in Nanjing were still negotiating over the distribution of National Assembly delegate seats, we received news from the north that General Li had publicly announced his candidacy for vice president.

General Li's early announcement demonstrates his bold and heroic spirit. However, General Li said, "Why am I announcing so early? It is to advocate for democratic politics. I hope to create a democratic atmosphere through this. As for success or failure, that is another matter." General Li clearly possesses the demeanor of a statesman. He also stated that success or failure is not the point. An election is like playing basketball; winning and losing are inevitable, and a shot will sometimes go in and sometimes miss. This open-mindedness cannot be cultivated in a day.

General Li is a capable general. The implementation of the "Three Self" policies in Guangxi in those years enabled Guangxi to transition from relying entirely on others to becoming self-sufficient. The leaders in promoting the "Three Self" policies were the so-called "Three Heroes" at the time, namely General Li, the current Minister of National Defense Bai (Chongxi), and Huang Xuchu, who is still in Guangxi Province. The three worked together to coordinate military, government, and civilian affairs. General Li is not a purely military man; this should be made clear here. At the same time, General Li uses this as his rallying cry. He says that although he is a military man, he is capable in politics. He cares about politics, he understands politics, and he has political ambition. Therefore, some people say that since the President is a military man, the Vice President should be a civilian, implying that General Li is not suitable for this condition. However, he is a talented individual with both military and civil capabilities. Furthermore, some people use regionalism, saying that since the President is from the South, the Vice President should be from the North. General Li happens to be from the South again. However, General Li uses facts to explain that although he is from the South, he presided over the Beiping Executive Headquarters and stayed in Beiping for two years. Moreover, he himself has no regional bias.

He not only cares about politics but also has considerable research on politics. While in Beiping, he had already started paying attention to studying the current political ills. After flying from Beiping to Shanghai, he published his opinions on reforming politics. Upon arriving in Nanjing, he discussed this issue during his first meeting with reporters. His view is this: "Our country has reached this point. If we still cannot find the source of the patient's illness to treat it, are we just going to watch him die?" He also affirmed, "I have my own views, I have insights from my research and observations, and I will definitely contribute new ideas to the new government."

If I were to criticize General Li, I could say, "General Li is not strikingly handsome." His height, appearance, etc., seem to be average. You don't detect any extraordinary charisma in him. As for his speech, his voice is light and soft, with a Guangxi accent. If you listen carefully, you will easily understand him. He never utters outlandish remarks. However, General Li has achieved the extraordinary through the ordinary.

General Li's participation in the election gives him considerable strength, yielding a North-South echo effect. Look, as soon as the news of General Li's candidacy was announced, didn't the support from various political parties start in the North? The support from compatriots in the North especially illustrates the gains from his handling of political affairs and further demonstrates that there is nothing inappropriate in a Southerner governing for Northerners. Therefore, I say that General Li's problem seems to be a problem that isn't a problem. I think General Li's strong campaign power means that even those who, as he himself put it, are older and more virtuous, may not necessarily be like him.

### Swedish Ministry of Defence Approves Five-Year Plan To Enhance Air Force and Strengthen Defence Moscow Pays Attention to the Development of the Situation in Northern Europe

[Reuters, Stockholm, 28th] Due to the changes in the international situation, Sweden has taken measures to strengthen its defence. The Ministry of Defence has approved a five-year plan to significantly increase the number of air force personnel, and General Jung, Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces, has requested the construction of new fortresses, airfields, and the conscription of more soldiers.

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] The Soviet Army newspaper Red Star reprinted a report from a Danish Communist newspaper, stating that Sweden has concluded a secret military agreement with Britain and the United States, and that Swedish warmongers are creating an atmosphere of war domestically. It is said that the agreement stipulates that Sweden and other Scandinavian countries have agreed not to acquire costly bombers, but will provide bases for American heavy bombers in the event of war.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 28th] The Soviet Army newspaper "Red Star" and the Navy newspaper "Red Fleet" today accused the Swedish military authorities of planning to build bases for American aircraft and said that warmongering groups are trying to control the Swedish government. "Red Fleet" published an article by commentator Semenov, stating that Swedish Army Commander-in-Chief Jung is planning to use the Swedish army as an appendage of the American military apparatus and to subordinate Swedish foreign policy to America's expansionist ambitions in Northern Europe. Jung's plan is to (1) build new fortifications and airfields in northern Sweden for American aircraft and paratroopers; (2) include the Swedish Air Force in the American Air Force system; (3) mobilize industry based on the import of American strategic materials; (4) increase the number of trained officers and soldiers with American weapons. The Soviet newspaper Izvestia also criticized Norway yesterday for planning to lease military bases to the United States and Britain. At a time when Finland and the Soviet Union are negotiating a treaty of friendship, it shows the Soviet Union's attention to the situation in Northern Europe.

[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 28th] The Communist Party newspaper "Land og Folk" commented on the recent military measures of the Danish government, calling them "a good show," the purpose of which is to merge Denmark into the Western bloc on the one hand, and to obtain loans to expand Denmark's military equipment on the other. It is also learned that the Danish Minister of Defence also commented on these military measures, saying that Denmark's future defence plan should focus on strengthening the air force, and the navy should have small formations and submarines.

### London Rumours Again Three Great Powers May Meet White House Says Truman Has No Intention of Leaving the Country

[Our Report] New York Broadcasting, 29th: Washington News, Presidential Press Secretary Ross declared that the rumour that President Truman, Prime Minister Attlee, and Marshal Stalin might hold a meeting in Berlin is not true. Truman has no plans to leave the United States.

[Associated Press, London, 28th] London's "Sunday Illustrated" reported on the 28th that President Truman, Prime Minister Attlee, and Marshal Stalin may meet in Berlin in mid-June to draft a plan to prohibit war. It is said that Truman and Attlee will support holding a three-power conference in Berlin, while Stalin seems to favour holding it in Moscow and will insist on a plan to stop the Western European alliance.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Political circles here predicted on the 28th that President Truman may soon embark on a world tour to gauge the reactions of various foreign capitals to the development of America's new foreign policy. President Truman's staff has privately stated that this trip could increase President Truman's political capital in the November election, but the source stated that President Truman himself has not mentioned any plans for this trip.

[Central News Agency, Istanbul, 28th, Associated Press] The local newspaper "Homeland" stated, according to semi-official sources, that US President Truman will visit Turkey and Greece next month. Truman's trip indicates that the United States will first aid all countries threatened by the Communist Party. The US President will travel on the cruiser "Augusta" and will have a special plane for his occasional needs. However, local officials have not made any comments on this matter.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Florida Democratic Senator Pepper, who repeatedly made pro-Soviet remarks last year, also bluntly accused the Soviet Union of invading its neighbours in a radio broadcast today, which offended America's sense of freedom. Pepper said that we are on the brink of war, and President Truman should meet with Premier Stalin face-to-face to make a final dramatic effort for peace. Truman should present Stalin with an American peace plan, including (1) calling on all countries to stop practising physical and ideological aggression; (2) guaranteeing to provide our country's economic assistance to compliant countries. This is not appeasement. I do not believe in appeasement. Before the United States aids the Soviet Union, it should obtain assurances that this assistance will not be used to attack us.

### Irish Unification Movement

[Reuters, London, 28th] Five thousand Irish people held a demonstration in London today against the division of Northern and Southern Ireland. Major Vivion de Valera (a lawyer), son of former Irish Prime Minister Eamon de Valera, delivered a speech to the crowd on a bombed-out wall. The crowd held signs with slogans such as "I want our country, England, you need our friendship, our condition is a unified Ireland." Vivion de Valera spoke vehemently, calling on the crowd to engage in a final attack to rebuild an independent and unified Ireland. "We are not kidding. The border between Northern and Southern Ireland must be abolished. This move affects the blood of every Irish person in the world." He warned Britain and the United States. He said that if Britain and the United States were to clash with Eastern Europe, they would hope that the Western front would be united, but if Ireland were divided, tensions would not be eliminated. Irish Ulster government member McCarthy accused the Northern Ireland government of implementing police rule. He demanded the immediate release of fifty Irish political prisoners imprisoned in Britain and Northern Ireland. Ulster League President Captain Ireland pointed out the disadvantage of a divided Ireland to Western countries. He said that if Ireland could be unified, it could form a military alliance with Britain, France, the United States, and the Western European Union, so that the weak point in the Atlantic Iron Curtain could be filled.

### Southern Army Conducts Major Maneuvers Adjacent to Trieste Port Plain

Liaison Meeting Cannot Be Held

[Central News Agency, a certain place in the occupied area of Southern Trieste Port, 28th, Associated Press] More than a thousand Yugoslavs conducted combat exercises today on the plains adjacent to the British and American occupied area of the free zone of Trieste Port. They practiced with machine guns, practiced infantry tactics, and listened to methods of using mortars. Through binoculars, reporters observed this vast plain for four hours and saw that this river valley had actually become a large training ground for various ground forces of the Southern nation.

[Reuters, Trieste, 28th] British and American officials revealed that the Yugoslav economic delegation of the free zone of Trieste Port, citing the illness of some members, refused to quickly decide on a date for a meeting with the British and American economic delegation of the free zone of Trieste Port. This meeting is usually held once a week to discuss economic and general issues. It is the only remaining regular contact between the British and American sides and the Yugoslav area. When revealing the above news, British and American officials stated that the British and American sides had accepted the explanation provided by the Southern side and did not believe that the meeting had been declared over.

### US Builds Air Force Base in Alaska

### The Soviet Union's Atomic Energy Control Plan Rejected by the Four Great Powers Still Hope the Soviet Union Will Propose New Proposals as a Basis for Discussion

[Reuters, Lake Success, 29th] The four countries of China, Britain, France, and the United States suggested today that the Soviet Union's atomic energy control plan be rejected. British representative Miles, on behalf of the three powers of China, Britain, and France, and with the tacit approval of the United States, solemnly informed the Soviet Union in the United Nations Atomic Energy Working Committee that continuing to discuss the Soviet Union's atomic energy control plan would no longer serve any useful purpose. The Soviet Union's atomic energy control plan has been under discussion since last June. Its content advocates the establishment of an international control authority under the Security Council to control the mining of atomic materials, the manufacturing of atomic bombs, and the right to inspect various atomic factories. The four powers of China, Britain, the United States, and France support the establishment of an international agreement to establish an international atomic control agency not subject to the jurisdiction of the Security Council to avoid the exercise of veto power. Miles read a statement from the four powers of China, Britain, the United States, and France in the working committee today, stating that the Soviet Union's atomic energy control plan is useless and insufficient to prevent the danger of atomic war. After a detailed study of the Soviet Union's plan, the four powers have confirmed that there is no need to continue discussing it. The Soviet Union's proposal cannot be accepted as the basis for international control of atomic energy. Miles stated that the Soviet government has not only failed to propose an appropriate atomic energy control system, but even declared that it will not agree to the establishment of a control system until all atomic weapons are prohibited and destroyed. It must be known that it is completely impossible in fact to ask any country to destroy its existing atomic weapons before obtaining assurances that all countries will be prohibited from manufacturing atomic weapons.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 29th] The four-power proposal does not mean a final and formal rupture with the Soviet Union on the entire atomic energy control issue. The four powers are still prepared to discuss new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the future and lay the foundation for a comprehensive debate on the atomic energy issue at the United Nations General Assembly to be held in Paris this autumn. It is deeply felt that the time has come for the General Assembly to use its moral power to break the deadlock.

### UK and Afghanistan Envoys Mutually Promoted

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] The British Foreign Office announced that the British government has agreed with the Afghan government to promote each other's envoys to ambassadors.

### There Will Be No War in the Next Five Years The View of British Atomic Energy Experts

[Reuters, Sydney, 28th] British atomic bomb expert Professor Oliphant, who came here to assist the Australian National Research Council, believes that there will be no war for at least five years. He said that the only country in the world with a large number of atomic bombs is the United States. The Soviet Union may be able to manufacture two or three in the next five years, but at least hundreds are needed to fight a war with atomic bombs, which cannot be achieved without many years of effort. As far as Western countries are concerned, if they want to launch a relatively confident major offensive against the Soviet Union, they still need several years of preparation. Therefore, it is said that the world will definitely not have a real war in at least five years, and in these few years, it may be possible to negotiate and try to resolve the war problem. Referring to atomic power generation, he believes that atomic power generation can compete with coal-fired power generation in ten years. If the world's electricity is to be completely derived from atomic energy, it must wait at least twenty-five years.

### US Aid to Europe and China Merger Bill Can Be Passed by the House of Representatives Vandenberg Expresses Disagreement with Embargo Against the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] US Senator Vandenberg and the State Department are deeply worried that escalating trade wars with the Soviet Union may endanger the European recovery plan and are extremely anxious about this. This anxiety is based on the belief that the response from Congress to the United States transporting aircraft engines into the Soviet Union is enough to prompt the House to take active action to cancel aid to Western European countries that trade with countries behind the Iron Curtain. The most anxious Senate leaders and State Department officials are the amendments proposed by House member Mundt to the House Foreign Affairs Committee bill.

The amendment orders officials presiding over foreign aid cases to cancel US aid to any Western European country that ships wartime valuable materials to the Soviet Union or its vassal states. The House will begin reviewing the amendments in its merged foreign aid bill on the 30th and is expected to hold a vote on the 31st to pass the bill. House leaders expect the bill to pass by a three-to-one overwhelming majority, after which the bill will be sent to a joint conference of the two houses of Congress to adjust its differences. The Senate bill is limited to the European Recovery Plan, while the House bill includes the European Recovery Plan. Economic aid to China plan. Military aid to Turkey, Greece, and China plan. Vandenberg and the State Department have both publicly stated that restoring pre-war Soviet-Western European trade is a fundamental prerequisite for the success of the Marshall Plan. However, they said that this important assumption is that this trade must have no meaning of being politically controlled by the Soviet Union. Republican foreign policy leader Vandenberg fiercely opposes the shipment of materials with war potential to the Soviet Union, but he agrees with the senior officials responsible for the European Recovery Plan that the shortcomings in the United States' export controls should not be remedied by including restrictive clauses in the amendment. Vandenberg's stance on restoring East-West trade was stated in the Senate on March 1. He said, "The exchange of East-West trade in Europe is necessary for both parties. The restoration of this trade will be beneficial to both parties. There is nothing in the European Recovery Plan that prevents the restoration of trade." The State Department's position on this matter is even stronger than this. In a report submitted to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, the State Department strongly stated that a long-term plan has already been drafted regarding the restoration of trade between the eastern and western parts of Europe. Without this trade, European economic recovery will be slower and more difficult, but it is not something that cannot be achieved."

### A US Congressman Demands Marshall's Resignation Says His Policy is Indecisive

[Central News Agency, Wadena, Minnesota, 28th, Associated Press] US House Finance Committee Chairman Knutson recently wrote an editorial in his own "Pioneer Newspaper," titled "Marshall Should Step Down." He attacked Marshall for complete failure in diplomacy and demanded his dismissal. He said that Marshall is arrogant and arbitrary, and his performance as Secretary of State is really unsatisfactory. We have had some great Secretaries of State, and we have also had mediocre and incompetent Secretaries of State, and we really do not consider their performance satisfactory. Marshall is one of them, Knutson said. Marshall is indecisive and difficult to formulate. Our position is becoming increasingly unstable. If we want to avoid war, we must immediately dismiss Marshall. His trip to Moscow was a complete failure. When Marshall saw that the plan for the partition of Palestine seemed impossible to implement, he changed his mind, reversed his original attitude, and abandoned the partition plan, instead advocating that the United Nations should take over Palestine. This proposal is as unenforceable as the partition plan. This is the first time that a member of Congress has publicly attacked the Secretary of State.

### Bomb Trap Exploded

### The United States Insists on Restoring the Gold Standard Coin System

[Associated Press, New York, 28th] Forty-two experts from the National Monetary Policy Committee today endorsed a bill introduced in the House of Representatives urging the restoration of the gold standard coin system, allowing people to use gold coins and to exchange banknotes for gold coins. Experts believe that the current monetary system only reduces purchasing power. The Monetary Policy Committee is composed of economics experts from universities and business circles and was established after the Roosevelt government implemented dollar devaluation in 1933.

### U.S. Actively Supports Japan; Early Policies Completely Overturned; Protests from Far Eastern Countries Will Also Be Disregarded

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Mr. Kenyon, a senior policy maker in the U.S. State Department, and the Draper mission recently arrived here. Developments in the Japanese situation indicate a shift in American policy, which now values Japan as the most useful nation in the troubled region of the Far East. While Undersecretary of the Army Draper stated that the mission has not yet reached a conclusion, his recent remarks suggest not only assurances of a lenient peace for Japan but also promises of economic aid similar to the Marshall Plan for Europe. The U.S. policy's excessive emphasis on Japan is completely contrary to earlier American policies.

In the past, American policy clearly contained fears of a resurgence of Japanese aggression. In early 1946, U.S. special envoy Pauley suggested in his report that Japan should not "become again the principal industrial consumer of raw materials from its neighbors, thereby controlling the economic life of its neighbors." Given Draper's recent reiteration of building Japan into a factory for the Far East, Pauley's suggestion has undoubtedly been abandoned. Another of Pauley's suggestions, "that the United States should not take any action that would help Japan maintain a standard of living higher than that of other Asian neighbors suffering from Japanese aggression," has also been discarded. It is rumored that the United States is now gradually granting large-scale economic aid to Japan, and Draper even guaranteed that Japanese industry will exceed the 1934 level. According to sources close to Mr. Kenyon, State Department policy still maintains "Europe First," as in peacetime as in wartime. However, these sources state that Mr. Kenyon believes Japan is more useful in assisting the United States than any other Far Eastern country. The shift in U.S. policy toward Japan originates domestically, but the occupation authorities in Japan also play a role. The Kenyon and Draper mission has been in constant consultation with officials from General Headquarters (GHQ), and GHQ has suggested that Japan must export to its Asian neighbors to maintain national survival. GHQ officials also suggested to the mission that, since Japan is the only country in the East with industrial knowledge, it is more useful in assisting the United States than any other Far Eastern country in any contingency. Undersecretary of the Army Draper stated in Japan that even if other Far Eastern countries raise strong protests, they will not be able to change U.S. policy toward Japan. He told the press that the U.S. aid plan for Japan is unrelated to the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission.

### Allied GHQ Takes Action to Stop Japanese Strikes

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Allied General Headquarters (GHQ) today took direct action to stop a series of labor strikes, which were scheduled to bring various Japanese government operations to a standstill starting tomorrow. Major General Marquat, chief of GHQ's Economic and Scientific Section, handed a memorandum this morning to Japanese Labor Minister Kato Kanju and Minister of Communications Yoshirouji, preventing the strikes on behalf of the Japanese government, because of their detrimental impact on the economy.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Eastern Japan (including Tokyo) is once again at a standstill in telephone, telegraph, and post office services due to another 24-hour strike that began last night. 160,000 telecommunications workers are participating in today's strike, which was called by the government and public utility workers' union federation after government-labor negotiations broke down yesterday. Meanwhile, approximately 200,000 telecommunications workers in western Japan may also strike starting at midnight tonight. Even if this strike becomes nationwide, it will not affect any telecommunications affairs of the occupation authorities.

### French Youth Group Cave Exploration

Previous Record Depth Reached 317 Meters

[Agence France-Presse, Forcalquier, France, 28th] A group of young scientists will re-enter the Garaudel cave in the Lower Alps of France today, one of the deepest caves in the world. Last year, the group reached a depth of 313 meters. They hope to go even deeper this time to investigate the actual content and extent of the cave. According to records, the cave was discovered in 1942 by referring to ancient maps. Due to the war, it was not until 1944 that an expedition descended 70 meters. Last year, the second team, equipped with better equipment, descended 317 meters. Today's descent has been carefully prepared and can communicate with people on the surface, so better results are expected.

### Starting from the Dutch-Indonesian Peace Talks: The Dutch Economic Offensive Against Overseas Chinese

‚Äî (Special Correspondent Huang Jiaozhen, Batavia)

It will soon be three years since the Japanese surrendered. For the past two to three years, the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have endured the hardships of war, death, displacement, and destitution. Since the ship of peace, the "Renville," came to the waters off Java from the United States, the Dutch and Indonesians began negotiations on December 10 last year. After twists and turns and setbacks, and with the political figures of various countries racking their brains, a truce agreement was finally signed on January 17 this year, and the principles of political negotiation were accepted. Turning swords into ploughshares and transforming hostility into harmony, the overseas orphans of the Chinese nation have witnessed the turmoil of this country for years, with innocent Chinese compatriots suffering. Now that the Dutch and Indonesian sides have reached a peaceful and reasonable resolution, how many people cannot help but be overjoyed and moved to tears!

We know that the success of the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations means that the Dutch side undoubtedly holds an overwhelming advantage militarily or politically. The repatriation of the Republican Army from the Dutch-controlled areas was completed on the evening of February 22 this year. The total number of troops repatriated was 29,000. The security of the Dutch-controlled areas is expected to be worry-free in the future, and conflicts and attacks may be reduced. The federal government was formally established on the 9th of this month. These facts show that the implementation of the truce agreement is generally smooth.

Planning Schemes on Overseas Chinese

After the Dutch have achieved great success in Indonesia's politics and military, they are now turning their attention to us Overseas Chinese and are planning schemes on us. In other words, after the success of the Dutch political offensive, they are launching an economic offensive aimed at our overseas Chinese merchants.

Our overseas Chinese merchants have started businesses overseas, making a living in foreign lands. They rely on their extraordinary labor or on personal skills, without the protection of the government of their motherland, and are repeatedly oppressed by local governments. After three and a half years of looting and plunder by the Japanese invaders, coupled with two years of the Indonesian independence movement and the chaos of war, the economic institutions of our overseas Chinese are almost on the verge of bankruptcy. Chinese merchants themselves are gradually realizing that their "golden age" has gradually passed, but they have been hesitating about how to respond to the economic offensive of the new situation. Last year's dispute between overseas Chinese merchants and the Agricultural Products Sales Bureau was not resolved reasonably. Now, the Dutch-Indonesian Ministry of Economic Affairs has launched a second offensive.

Dutch Monopoly on Import Trade

According to the Dutch authorities, the main purpose of restricting free trade is to eradicate smuggling and prevent capital flight. We carefully examine their motives and realize that this is a trick performed by the five major Dutch trading firms, who are determined to monopolize and manipulate all import trade. We are quite aware of the fact that Dutch finances have been in deficit and foreign exchange has been depleted since the war. It is not unreasonable to take necessary steps due to the shortage of foreign exchange. However, if it is categorically stated that the devaluation of the Dutch currency in Singapore and Hong Kong is the result of smuggling by overseas Chinese merchants, we can never accept this deliberately accusatory fallacy. The fact is obvious that the important factor in the devaluation of the Dutch currency is that the export of indigenous products from the Dutch East Indies has been strictly restricted and cannot compete in overseas markets, and the reason for the sharp decline in exports is undoubtedly the impact of the turbulent situation.

Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have always been the most law-abiding. Now, a very small number of overseas Chinese merchants, because they cannot obtain foreign exchange and cannot engage in normal business, have to engage in smuggling. If the situation can be restored to the previous state, the trend of smuggling will definitely disappear. At the same time, we know that this capital outflow is not gone forever. In fact, the Dutch government does not normally issue foreign exchange to Chinese merchants, but the goods imported from Singapore and Hong Kong are shipped into the Dutch East Indies by Chinese merchants batch by batch, prospering the local markets. This shows that what is escaping is capital, and what is flowing in is goods. In the past year alone, according to rough statistics from the customs, tariff revenue was about 60 million guilders, and the unofficial trade cannot be counted. Even if we calculate it at 10%, the tariffs from free trade would also be considerable.

Economic Controls Lead to Currency Outflow

Although the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs has repeatedly stated that restricting imports is only restricting luxury goods and not restricting daily necessities, it is difficult to draw a clear line between the two. Let us not talk about cosmetics, rouge, and lipstick, but only talk about daily necessities. Toothpaste, talcum powder, soap, small mirrors, bone combs, and hair oil are all taxed at 30% when imported. Only face towels and bath towels are regarded as cotton fabrics and are taxed at 10%. From this perspective, daily necessities and luxury goods are almost indistinguishable. If daily necessities that are taxed at 30% are regarded as luxury goods, then if you open a department store at random, "luxury goods" will account for at least 70% or more.

Since the Dutch East Indies fell into Japanese hands, all the materials stockpiled before the war have been consumed by the Japanese invaders for three and a half years, and the remaining amount is limited, which obviously cannot meet the needs of the citizens. In the past, the imports of the rationing bureau could not meet the urgent needs of the citizens either due to the restriction of foreign exchange. Now, our overseas Chinese merchants do not need to use foreign exchange to import a large number of daily necessities for the people, and prosper the local markets. According to reason, this kind of trade should not be strictly restricted. Although the government authorities still have rationing now, it is a drop in the bucket and does not help. For example, if citizens rely solely on rationing for cloth, they would probably have been in rags long ago. As another example, if we rely solely on the Rehabilitation Industry Bureau for caustic soda, perhaps the small industries would have already closed down. The import of other daily necessities is almost entirely through the black market, which circulates in the markets here.

In extraordinary times, economic control is necessary, and its purpose is to seek the welfare of the majority of people and ensure social stability. However, the drawbacks often lie in competing with the people for profit, or even allowing a few people to enjoy the benefits, resulting in the people's distress not being alleviated, and complaints are already rampant. This is what should be avoided in the control policy.

Raise Awareness and Adapt to the Trend

The reporter has witnessed the tragic suffering of the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies after the scourge of war, and they have been subjected to the ruthless attacks of the local government. Therefore, I especially express my infinite sympathy to the overseas Chinese. The reporter hopes that the overseas Chinese will quickly raise their awareness, promote greater unity, and must have a new attitude and a close organization to develop and protect the inherent position of the overseas Chinese. We deeply know that times are different now, the economic situation has fundamentally changed. In the country, regulation is prevalent, and private activities are often restricted. In society, group cooperation prevails, and individual operations cannot withstand oppression. Considering the past and present lifestyles and business methods of the overseas Chinese, there is inevitably a sense of being behind the times and being difficult to accommodate the environment. If we do not work hard to improve ourselves as soon as possible in order to respond to the trend and catch up, then when the opportunity for natural selection comes, we will inevitably be at a loss as to what to do. This is also what the reporter, considering the changes in the world and predicting the future, sincerely wishes to convey to the overseas Chinese everywhere (especially those in the Dutch East Indies), and to call for attention.

### Special Pan-American Conference to Discuss South American Colonial Issues; Nine Latin American Countries to Request U.S. Loans

[Reuters, Bogot√°, 29th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia stated that the issue of European countries' colonies in South America will be discussed in a special conference, which only related countries can attend. Mr. Bramuglia and Peruvian Foreign Minister Revledo arrived here together yesterday from Lima. The colonial issues to be raised at the Pan-American Conference include Guatemala and Mexico's claims to British Honduras, Venezuela's claim to British Guiana, and Argentina's claim to the British Falkland Islands. Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, and other countries have declared that they will support Guatemala's resolution to strip the British, French, Dutch, and Portuguese of their colonies in the Americas. Venezuelan newspapers have recently been vigorously advocating the recovery of British Guiana. It is expected that the Venezuelan representatives will also support the resolution. Colombia, which decided to remain neutral two weeks ago, also seems to be changing its attitude.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall boarded a plane to Bogot√°, the capital of Colombia, on the night of the 28th to attend the Pan-American Conference. After telling reporters that he hoped to achieve important results at this Pan-American Conference, he took off from Washington National Airport on an Army C-54 transport plane. The Marshall delegation is scheduled to arrive in Bogot√° on the afternoon of the 29th. Mr. Marshall is the head of the U.S. delegation of ninety members attending the Ninth Pan-American Conference, which is the first conference since the meeting in 1938. Martin, a director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, also accompanied Mr. Marshall. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman will join later. Mr. Marshall said that the widespread participation of representatives from Latin American countries in the conference and close consultations with the U.S. representatives will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the event. It is expected that Mr. Marshall will try to form a solid Western Hemisphere front against Soviet expansion. The Colombian Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Barramilo, personally went to the airport to see Mr. Marshall off.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The main agenda of the Pan-American Conference will be: reorganizing the Pan-American system, economic assistance to Latin America, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes over the Pan-American permanent defense organization, and fulfilling the Pan-American Defense Agreement of September last year. However, Mr. Marshall is most concerned about the situation in Europe, where the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Italy and the Middle East will reach its peak this month. The British withdrawal from Palestine is only six weeks away. In his private conversations with the foreign ministers of the American republics, he will seek their support for the U.S. position. Generally speaking, Latin American countries advocate that the United States should take a tough stance against the Soviet Union, so there should be no problem for them to support the new U.S. anti-Soviet policy. However, Mr. Marshall may not be able to grant the economic aid requested by Latin America immediately. Although Mr. Marshall announced that he would request Congress to lend 500 million yuan from the Export-Import Bank to Latin America, he still needs to convince the Latin American countries that the main economic recovery plan must start in Europe.

### Gottwald's Speech: The Czechoslovak Coup Filled a Gap; Believes War Will Not Happen

[Reuters, Prague, 28th] Czechoslovak Prime Minister Gottwald stated today that a Third World War will never happen because the peace forces led by the Soviet Union are so strong that anyone who dares to launch a new war will be abandoned by their own people. Mr. Gottwald was addressing the Prague district Communist Party conference in his capacity as chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. He said that the recent events in Czechoslovakia have closed the gap on the line from Stettin to Trieste. This move will have a considerable impact on the working class in the West, whose strength cannot be underestimated. Mr. Gottwald continued that the success in February was largely due to the local organizations of the Communist Party. He recalled that after Czechoslovakia was liberated in 1945, the future tasks of the bourgeoisie in Czechoslovakia were not fully understood, so the bourgeoisie retained some material possessions and political rights. Now the reactionary forces have been completely defeated. Except for a few misguided students, no one is fighting for the plans of the reactionary elements anymore. The majority of farmers have also joined the workers. The future task is to intensify the implementation of socialism. Since the reactionary elements have not been physically destroyed, and we do not intend to destroy them physically, the Communists must remain vigilant at all times. Before the election on May 31, the government's plans, including the constitution, will be implemented, and state-owned measures will become law. The political consequences of the February Revolution will be systematically realized. The purge movement will prevent reactionary elements from gaining an advantage again, but some mistakes in the purge movement must also be corrected. Mr. Gottwald reiterated that the East and Southeast welcomed the news of the Czechoslovak events with satisfaction and pleasure. Although the reactionary forces in the West are gnashing their teeth, the workers in Britain, France, and Italy will gain greater confidence as a result.

### No Residual Radiation After Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: U.S. Atomic Bomb Survey Commission Report

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 29th] Dr. Tessmer, a U.S. Army pathologist and chairman of the Atomic Bomb Damage Survey Commission, released a report today stating that, based on long-term on-site research on the impact of the Hiroshima bombing, the area completely lacks the dangerous radiation remaining on the target ships in the Bikini Lagoon. The second atomic bomb test at Bikini was conducted underwater, resulting in residual radiation. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the first test at Bikini were all conducted in the air, and there was no residual radiation sufficient to cause disease.

Ships and drinking water in Hiroshima Harbor were also not affected by radiation. In other words, from the moment of the explosion, there was no evidence of any other damage. Dr. Aubin of the National Research Council agreed. After the atomic bomb exploded, it produced countless fissionable materials, which were invisible to the naked eye. These fissionable materials were quickly blown away by the wind at an altitude of 1,800 feet, resulting in a completely different outcome from underwater explosions. In underwater explosions, the fissionable materials did not disperse but concentrated, forming a dense fog that adhered to the ship's hull, resulting in residual radiation. Residual radiation can last for a long time without disappearing. The target ship at Bikini Island recently sank, which is why.

### Busy Digging Trenches Near the Border Between U.S. and Soviet Occupation Zones

[Our Report] New York, 29th Broadcast: Seoul reports that Soviet soldiers and Korean farmers in the North are digging trenches and building fortresses along the border between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones. The U.S. side does not know what their intentions are. The purpose is probably to make the people of North Korea believe that the Americans and South Koreans are about to attack North Korea. This preparation work was discovered by U.S. patrols at the beginning of this month. At first, it was thought that they were digging irrigation ditches, but the nature of the work became clear around the 9th of this month.

### Siam Nominates Envoys to Shanghai, China, and the Soviet Union

Seeking the Consent of Relevant Countries

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 29th] According to news from the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has nominated diplomatic representatives to be sent to Nanjing, Moscow, London, Paris, Rangoon, and Bern. The names of the representatives will not be announced until the consent of the respective countries has been obtained. Phya Apibal, nominated as the Siamese Ambassador to China, is a member of the Senate and a career diplomat who was stationed in Washington and several European capitals before World War II. Phya Sarasas, nominated as the Siamese Minister to the Soviet Union, is also a member of the Senate and a famous writer.

### British Independent Labour Party Stops Election Campaign Activities

[Reuters, Southport, 28th] The Independent Labour Party, the founder of the British Labour Party, held its annual meeting here today. After a four-hour debate, it decided to stop all election campaign activities of the party. Announcing the decision after the meeting, the party's General Secretary, Mr. McNair, stated that the party's decision to establish this was due to the clear knowledge that the world was moving towards a Third World War. If an atomic war were to occur, civilization would be destroyed. The party's main goal in the future will be to work to promote the realization of a United Socialist States of Europe to prevent war from happening. If the world situation changes, the Independent Labour Party will change its policy and rejoin the election campaign.

### Myanmar Arrests Communists

[Central News Agency, Rangoon, 28th, United Press] Police here have searched the headquarters of the Burmese Communist Party and all known hiding places for Communists. It is reported that weapons have been found and some Communist Party members have been arrested, but Burmese Communist leaders such as Than Tun have escaped the net. The strikes incited by the Communist Party in the four major foreign companies are continuing, including the Burma Oil Company. The government has sealed off news sources, stopped all official news supply to newspapers, and banned the publication of strike news.

### A Grand Gathering at the Gymnasium: Triple Celebration Commemorating Youth Day, the Inauguration of the National Assembly, and Revolution Martyrs
Mayor Advocates for Democracy and Freedom, Encourages Youth to Promote the Three Principles of the People

[Our Correspondent] The inaugural session of the National Assembly convened under the Constitution was grandly opened yesterday in Nanjing. Coinciding with the 5th Youth Day, all institutions, banks, schools, factories, and markets in the city were granted a day off to celebrate. Following a period of continuous rain, the weather cleared, with sunlight shining brightly, and national flags fluttering throughout the city, creating a lively atmosphere. Besides the grand joint celebration ceremony held at the City Gymnasium in the morning, various activities such as speeches, group weddings, and sports events were held at the Youth Center and the Gymnasium, respectively. All cinemas added matinee showings with half-price discounts. All bookstores also offered discounts to youth and students. The Youth Sports Committee hosted a youth social gathering at Yucai Middle School at 7 p.m., featuring various exciting performances, with enthusiastic participation from the youth.

The Shanghai City Commemoration of the National Assembly Inauguration, 5th Youth Day, and Revolutionary Martyrs Meeting was held at the Gymnasium yesterday morning at 9 a.m. More than 2,000 people from all walks of life attended, with a particularly large number of youth and students participating. Mayor Wu, as the chairman, delivered a speech, stating: "Today, the National Assembly is inaugurated in Nanjing, which also marks the 5th Youth Day. After continuous days of rain, the sky has cleared, which symbolizes a bright and limitless future for China. The hope of the people is for China to achieve genuine peace and democracy, the foundation of which lies in the youth of the nation. Commemorating Youth Day today has profound significance. Looking around the world, the divide between the democratic and communist blocs is becoming increasingly clear. Which side the youth choose depends on their wise judgment. Communism is a dictatorship of a small class, devoid of freedom. Democracy, on the other hand, is based on the will of the majority of the people and strives for the freedom of the people. The recently deceased Czech Foreign Minister, the son of the first president of Czechoslovakia, went to his late father's tomb to weep bitterly before his death to defend genuine democracy and freedom, sacrificing his life for his belief. This spirit is truly admirable. Under communist dictatorship, there is no freedom of the press, assembly, etc. To promote the true meaning of democracy and freedom, we must first overthrow the Communist Party. Hitler once said, 'A lie repeated a thousand times becomes the truth.' The Communist Party's conspiracies and lies are similar in nature." The mayor then recounted the facts of the "Tongji University Student Uprising," exposing in detail the manipulation and violence incited by a small number of conspirators behind the scenes, and resolutely stated, "Today, we only have two paths: we must choose between 'democracy' and 'communism.' If we want genuine peace and democracy, we must promote the Three Principles of the People and overthrow communism. I am determined to make any sacrifice to strive for this goal, and I hope that the youth will respond and lay the foundation for a democratic China."

Passed Three Telegrams Congratulating the Opening of the National Assembly, Paying Respect to Chairman Chiang, and Comforting the Soldiers

Subsequently, Zhao Yangxiong read aloud three telegrams from the assembly congratulating the opening of the National Assembly, paying respect to Chairman Chiang, and comforting the soldiers on the front lines, which were passed amidst enthusiastic applause from the entire assembly. The telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) Congratulating the Opening of the National Assembly: To all representatives of the National Assembly in Nanjing, as the Communist bandits rebel and the nation faces difficulties, the representatives of the inaugural National Assembly convened under the Constitution gather in the capital, with all wise men present, offering advice to the central government, working diligently to improve governance, practicing democracy, reversing the decline, suppressing the bandits, establishing a solid foundation for constitutional government, and accomplishing the great task of nation-building. As the congress opens, the people are encouraged to celebrate the implementation of the Constitution and enjoy the protection of democracy. We send this telegram to express our congratulations and hope you will consider it. Shanghai City Joint Celebration of the Opening of the National Assembly, the Fifth Youth Day, and the Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs Assembly.

(2) Paying Respect to Chairman Chiang: To Chairman Chiang of the National Government in Nanjing, the Communist bandits have raised arms and rebelled, destroying unity, and the red disaster is rampant, making the nation difficult. Fortunately, Your Excellency has been working diligently day and night, leading the suppression of the rebellion and the building of the nation, saving the people from fire and water, and rescuing the nation from danger. Your achievements are outstanding, and the people admire and respect you. As the inaugural National Assembly is successfully opened, with many talented people gathered, constitutional government is achieved, laying a solid foundation for democracy and completing the great success of the revolution, we send this telegram to express our respect and hope you will consider it.

(3) Comforting the Soldiers on the Front Lines: To the officers and soldiers on the front lines of the National Defense Department in Nanjing, the Communist bandits have conspired to betray the country, raising arms and rebelling, massacring the innocent, and wherever the red hooves go, the houses are ruined. Fortunately, our loyal soldiers are fighting bravely, shedding blood and fighting bitterly, seeing through the enemy's plans, and repeatedly suppressing the bandit's flames, preventing their conspiracies and vicious plans from succeeding. Now, the stubborn bandits are intensifying their efforts, selling out the motherland, intensifying their rebellion, and isolating themselves from the people. We firmly believe that justice will prevail over evil, and the removal of the red atmosphere is imminent, and the restoration of the mountains and rivers is just around the corner. We send this telegram to express our respect and hope you will consider it.

Cao Jun Explains the Significance of Youth Day

Subsequently, Cao Jun, Deputy Director of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech, stating: "The current domestic situation, whether in politics, military affairs, or economy, is still in a difficult stage. We are not satisfied, and we must not deny it. However, we firmly believe that the darkest moment is before the dawn. We must pass through the eve of dawn with increased vigilance and patience. Today is Youth Day and the anniversary of the Huanghuagang martyrs. The creation of the Republic of China was the result of the blood and sacrifice of the Huanghuagang martyrs and countless patriots. When the martyrs dedicated themselves to the revolution, they were mostly young students. The succeeding youth groups, carrying on the spirit of the martyrs, from the Northern Expedition to the War of Resistance, served as the backbone of the vanguard fighters. The whole country was invigorated, and finally achieved the final victory. The government clearly designated today as 'Youth Day,' which has profound significance. However, since the victory, the organizational work of the youth has been somewhat insufficient, which has been exploited by Communist conspirators to use the youth to realize their ambitions. This has been confirmed in the recent Communist documents. We must address this point, strengthen the youth, and deal a fatal blow to the Communist conspiracy."

Qian Jianqiu Delivers a Speech

Next, Qian Jianqiu, a representative of women, delivered a speech, elaborating on three points: (1) Today is the anniversary of the Huanghuagang martyrs. We must inherit and promote the revolutionary spirit of the Huanghuagang martyrs. (2) The National Assembly is opened in Nanjing today. We must promote the Three Principles of the People with revolutionary spirit and work hard for constitutional government. (3) Today is also the Fifth Youth Day. We should awaken the youth, expose the Communist bandits' conspiracy to harm the country, and seek happiness for the people. She also reiterated the chairman's statement issued yesterday, clarifying that democratic politics is to seek the welfare of the majority of the people with the will of the majority of the people, which is in accordance with the principles of nature and the trend of the times. She believes that in the struggle between democracy and communism, democratic politics will defeat the Communist dictatorship politics that seeks the interests of the minority of the people with the will of the minority of the people, and achieve the final victory.

Student Representative Delivers a Speech

Finally, the youth student representative delivered a speech, stating: "In the current situation, we must first seek national stability. Today, the government convened the National Assembly and started constitutional government, which is the beginning of national stability. I hope that the youth will strengthen unity, exert their greatest strength, assist the government, and work hard to promote constitutional government." The commemorative ceremony was completed at 11:30 a.m. amidst enthusiastic slogans, and the entertainment program of the China K.U.M. Society began immediately after that. The meeting adjourned at noon.

### Wonderful Spring Scenery

[Our Correspondent] Yesterday was a triple commemoration day, with clear weather and a vibrant spring atmosphere. Institutions and schools were closed for a day, resulting in parks filled with visitors. Longhua was crowded with vehicles, and even taxis in the city were fully hired. The tender willows and blooming peach blossoms in the suburbs, along with the warm breeze, created pleasant scenery. It is expected that the number of people enjoying the spring will increase even more in the future.

Accompanied by friends, one goes to enjoy the spring. The number of visitors to the park is as dense as a weave.

(2) Tianxing Factory is allowed to pay 90% of the original base salary. (3) Dehua Factory is allowed to pay 85% of the original base salary. (4) The above discounts should be cancelled at any time and the original base salary should be restored if the factory's business improves.

### Ma Baoshan and Others in the Canned Food Industry Labor Union Ordered to Cease Activities

The authorities in this city recently cracked down on a large-scale Communist bandit organization. Among them were Communist bandit elements lurking in canned food companies such as Ma Baoshan and Taikang, who were also arrested. At that time, the Ma Baoshan and Taikang branches of the canned food industry labor union launched a strike to threaten and demand the release of the arrested Communist bandits. Fortunately, the authorities persuaded them, and no major accident occurred. The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the two branches have not handled this incident properly and ordered them to cease activities yesterday.

### New Invention in the Academic World, Electric Indexing Machine, Successfully Tested

Mr. Ge Zhaotong of the Research Department of National Chengchi University has been researching the use of indexing techniques for many years. Recently, he commissioned Mr. Zhang Zonghuang of the China Electric Company to manufacture an "Electromechanical Active Indexing Machine." It is temporarily powered by manual cranking. If the user wants to find the source of certain information (single characters are also acceptable) in a book, or to compile a word-by-word index of a book, they can first connect the wires and connect the "code plug" to the code disk of the desired character. Then, by cranking the shaft, the source of the desired information can be obtained on a piece of paper, and a word-by-word index of the book can be created. This machine is a preliminary model and has received considerable assistance from Mr. Zhong Jixiang. Further improvements are needed in the application. Currently, Mr. Ge is designing it to work with certain mechanisms so that all Western books can also be compiled into word-by-word indexes and any information can be obtained. From now on, manual index compilation can be brought to an end thanks to the invention of this machine. The difficulty in the Chinese saying "Where to start with the Twenty-Four Histories" is also solved. Zhang Xuecheng, a Qing Dynasty historian, advocated in his book "School Correction of Comprehensive Meaning" that "Chinese and foreign books should be classified and indexed." The ideal has now been realized. The use of active indexing is a convenient method for academic research, and it also makes a significant contribution to library science, lexicography, philology, history, and current affairs information. It is reported that Mr. Ge has been conducting simple experiments with the book "Great Learning" in recent days. The results are very satisfactory, and a public demonstration will be held in this city soon. It is reported that he has borrowed the Wu Liande Hall of the Asian Literary Society at No. 20 Huqiu Road and invited people from the academic press to visit and give guidance for improvement.

### Large Batch of War Criminals in Beiping to be Transferred to Shanghai

According to the person in charge of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on Jiangwan Road, the work of trying war criminals in various places is being ordered by the Ministry of National Defense to be completed as soon as possible. In the future, all war criminals who have been sentenced throughout the country will be gradually concentrated in the Jiangwan War Criminals Prison in this city for execution. The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals in Beiping has been ordered to end at the end of this month, and Kaifeng and other places have also ended this month. All unfinished cases will be transferred to the Military Tribunal in this city for trial. On April 5, a large batch of Japanese war criminals will be escorted to Shanghai for execution or trial, including many war criminals at the rank of general. Therefore, the work of the court will be tense again, but it is still determined to end before June of this year.

### Solving the Distress of Working Women: The Budding Daycare Undertaking, A Statistical Total of 26 Centers in the City, Faced With Financial Difficulties, Revenue Insufficient to Cover Expenses

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper] Miss XX received a high level of education and has talent. When she was in school, she repeatedly stated that she wanted to devote herself to society and serve the people. However, less than two years after she entered society, she gave up her career, extinguished her ideals, and buried her knowledge and talent in the family. It turned out that she had become a mother. There are too many examples like this among the relatives, friends, and colleagues we come into contact with. For most working women, the birth of a child after marriage is like the death knell of their career life, but unless they are willing to violate human nature and remain old maids for the rest of their lives, they cannot avoid this inevitable obstacle. This is truly the greatest sorrow and distress of working women.

In some countries in the world, this kind of distress has long been solved by the widespread establishment of daycare centers. But in China, the term daycare center is probably still unfamiliar to most people, and the daycare undertaking is just budding and taking root in an inconspicuous situation.

How Much Risk Do You Have to Take for the Health of Your Children?

According to recent statistics, there are currently 26 daycare centers in Shanghai, including 8 for working women, 5 for working women's employees, and 12 lactation rooms in factories. A total of more than 1,500 children are cared for, ranging in age from five months to six years. Most of these daycare centers only provide daytime care and are similar in nature to kindergartens. Only a few, such as the Professional Women's Daycare Center on Jiangxi Road, the YWCA Daycare Center on Weihai Road, the Shanghai Daycare Center on Jin Shenfu Road, and the Youyou Daycare Center on Disiwei Road, provide daycare around the clock.

"Running a daycare center is a thankless job. How much risk do you have to take for the health of your children? If you take good care of them, the parents will at most smile and say thank you. But if the children have a slight pain or itch, the parents will question the center and even launch a full-scale inquisition." This is Ms. Xu Jingzhi, the director of the Professional Women's Daycare Center, complaining to the reporter.

Tears at First, Then Laughter Through Tears

"Therefore," she said, "the center asks doctors to check the children three times a week, and nurses measure their temperature every day. If they have a slight fever, they will immediately notify their family or find a way to treat them. Some of the parents who send their children to the daycare center are working women, some are divorced couples, and some are parents of illegitimate children. When the children are first sent in, they inevitably cry and make noise. At this time, nannies and teachers need to guide them patiently. Some parents send their children to daycare centers out of necessity. At first, they are often reluctant to leave, and even shed tears. Later, when they see that their children are living not badly in the daycare center, they feel relieved and smile through their tears."

The Center That Houses the Most Children Has More Than 100 People

The Professional Women's Daycare Center is currently the daycare center that houses the most children, but there are only more than 100 people in total, divided into three groups. Children from five full months to one year old are placed in the infant nursery, children from one to four years old are placed in the toddler nursery, and children from four to six years old are placed in the kindergarten. Children in the infant nursery are artificially fed, and children in the kindergarten and toddler nursery eat two snacks and three meals a day. In addition to care, the kindergarten also provides kindergarten education. The children live together in a group, and their innocent activities and pure laughter become a source of comfort for the workers.

Currently, the biggest difficulties facing various daycare centers are insufficient funding and housing. Because working women have weak financial capacity and prices are rising daily, the revenue is not enough to cover the expenses. The government is unable to take care of them due to its own financial difficulties. Therefore, the existing daycare centers are only in their formative stages. It seems that the widespread establishment of large-scale daycare centers like those in other countries still needs to wait for quite some time to be realized.

### Wife Plots to Seize Property, Mastermind Behind the Scenes: Wuxi Merchant Recounts Ordeal, Forcibly Imprisoned in Asylum, Factory Renamed and Occupied

[Our Newspaper] Recently, a shocking case occurred in this city involving a merchant being forcibly confined in a mental hospital. The victim, a native of Wuxi, sought redress from the Wuxi Sojourners Association in Shanghai after regaining his freedom. Yesterday, the association hosted the press to appeal for justice and to hear the account of the ordeal from the "insane" person, who appears to be of sound mind. The details are as follows:

Yan Peixing, a 42-year-old Wuxi native, owns the Huaxing Textile Hardware Manufacturing Factory in Shanghai. He married Yuan Bao Ying, 44 years old. The couple has been married for 18 years, and the relationship has been strained. Yan, being naturally weak, often suppresses his anger. In 1945, due to accumulated anger, Yan scribbled on a note, "If I were the emperor, I could kill my wife," a few words, which his wife subsequently obtained and kept. At the end of last year, Yan and his wife disagreed over their daughter's marriage. Since they have no sons, only two daughters, his wife intended to marry their eldest daughter to her nephew, which Yan opposed. As a result, their relationship became even more

Strained Beyond Repair

Around 10 a.m. on the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month last year (Little New Year's Eve), Yan was at the general distribution office of Yexing Textile Hardware Manufacturing Factory on Henan North Road when five or six men in military uniforms, carrying weapons but without insignia, and plainclothes individuals barged in, claiming to take over the property. They forcibly pushed him out and locked the door. Unable to resist, Yan temporarily sought refuge at the Huaxing Yarn Tube Factory on Middle Zheng Road. Later that evening, around 10 p.m., concerned about the large quantity of goods (thirty or forty boxes of weaving shuttles of various sizes) stored in the Henan North Road distribution office, he went to check. He saw the interior

Brightly Lit

His wife, Yuan Bao Ying, and nephew, Yuan Xiangzheng, were inside, secretly moving goods. Upon hearing Yan's voice, they scattered and fled through the back door. The next day (New Year's Eve), around 4 p.m., while Yan was working upstairs in the general distribution office, the same five or six armed men in military uniforms suddenly broke in again. He distinctly heard his wife, Yuan Bao Ying, speaking downstairs. Shortly after, he was forced into a car and taken directly to Puji Hospital in Zhuanqiao, where he was forcibly admitted as a madman. After entering the hospital, according to Yan Peixing's recollection, the hospital did not conduct an examination but instead, the doctor, Wang, immediately injected

Anesthetic Doses

As many as eight times. Yan resisted, tearing his undershirt in the process. Later, he was shackled with handcuffs and confined to ward number four. Yesterday, Yan showed the torn undershirt and the marks of the shackles on his hands, claiming that according to the regulations of the mental hospital, the admission of a madman requires a certificate from the health bureau, but he had never been examined by the health bureau at all. Yan remained in the hospital for over a month, until recently when he managed to write a letter to his cousin and others to find a way to rescue him. His sister then reported the matter to the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, which dispatched personnel to the hospital on the 26th of this month to interrogate him, after which he was allowed to

Bail Him Out

Yan immediately went to Renji and Yihang hospitals for examinations, which proved that he had no mental abnormalities. Fearing being sent back to the asylum, he went to the Wuxi Sojourners Association in Shanghai for assistance and protection. At the same time, because his personal chops, documents, and account books had been taken away by his wife beforehand, and the Huaxing Textile Hardware Manufacturing Factory, which he had founded with his life's blood, had been renamed Southeast Textile Hardware Manufacturing Factory, he has hired a lawyer to initiate legal proceedings. According to his relatives and members of the sojourners association, this matter appears to be motivated by his wife's desire for his property, but there is another mastermind behind the scenes.

### National Refined Kerosene Industry‰∫âCompetes for Diesel Fuel Supply: To Survive, Will Petition Again

[Our Newspaper] After the war, the emerging national refined kerosene factories were once banned by the authorities. Later, after repeated petitions to various parties by the Oils and Fats Association, it was clarified that the existence of the national refined kerosene industry not only helps to supply fuel and depress prices but also saves foreign exchange, making it an industry necessary for people's livelihood and beneficial to the national economy. The authorities were then persuaded to allow them to continue operating, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs sympathized and agreed to support them, ordering the Management Committee to allocate diesel fuel. The Oils and Fats Association applied for allocation, and the association responded with two measures: (1) Each kerosene refinery should register according to the general factory registration method. (2) The scope of registration should be based on those who have registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, have obtained registration certificates, and are regularly operating. Each factory in the industry completed the registration procedures according to these two measures. However, the Transportation and Allocation Committee has consistently refused to allocate fuel, claiming that diesel imports are limited and that the allocation cannot be divided. The industry believes that other factories have coal as a fuel substitute, while kerosene refining cannot be done without diesel. If the authorities do not allocate it, national refined kerosene factories will not be able to survive. Yesterday, the person in charge of the industry association stated that all the competent authorities believe that diesel fuel should be allocated to the national refined kerosene industry, and even the Transportation and Allocation Committee has not denied it, but in reality, the allocation has not been approved. Now, for the sake of their own survival, the industry will petition the competent authorities again to fight for diesel allocation.

### Hua Le Coal Mine Opens New Shaft and Resumes Production

[Our Newspaper, Pei County, 25th Airmail] Among the coal mines near the battlefield, the Huadong Coal Mine in Jiawang has had a very fortunate experience. During the Japanese puppet era, although it was mined fiercely, almost to the point of exhausting its resources, it did not suffer any direct damage. On the contrary, it added equipment and housing. During the two years of the suppression of the rebellion, the bandits became professional coal mine destroyers. The Zhongxing Coal Mine in Yixian, not far from Jiawang, which usually had a daily output of 20,000 tons, has not yet resumed production after being destroyed. However, Jiawang was able to gradually restore production after being taken over and has not been destroyed by war even once. Now, it is still

Opening New Shafts

Planning for the long term. Amid the sound of destruction, it is a very exciting event.

The coal mine straddles the provinces of Jiangsu and Henan and is located in the area where the three counties of Tongshan (Jiangsu) and Tengyi (Shandong) interlock. So far, the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Shandong are still arguing over the ownership of the coal mine, for obvious reasons, they all regard it as a reliable source of tax revenue.

The history of the mine is not short. It was founded in 1898 by Hu Biwei of Jiangsu and named Jiawang Coal Mining Company. In 1927, it was renamed Shanghai Xiejie Company. In 1928, the property was transferred to Huadong Company, which was purely a commercial stock. The deposits in the Jiawang area were exhausted and abandoned, and the current Xiayang mining area is under the jurisdiction of Xiaqiao, Tengxian, Shandong. Before the War of Resistance, it already had a considerable scale. The total area of the mining area is 154,349 acres, the coalfield is widely distributed, and the reserves are estimated at more than 80 million tons according to drilling records. The basic equipment of the mine is complete, and there are also attached small flour mills, soap factories, tap water and electricity grids, etc. In terms of transfer equipment, there are more than 10 kilometers of light railways between Jiawang and Liuquan, which are used exclusively for coal transportation.

Looking at the Huadong Coal Mine from Jiawang Station, you can see rows of neat and small red buildings, which are the workers' housing and the relics of the Japanese occupation of the coal mine. To be fair, the Japanese made some construction efforts in the Suining area during the war. They once dreamed of developing the entire East China with Xuzhou as the core. Therefore, in Xuzhou, they opened wide roads and built more than 100 factories. In the areas surrounding Xuzhou, they also did some construction work. Taking Huadong Coal Mine as an example, the Japanese widened the light railway between Jiawang and Liuquan to connect with the Jinpu Railway. The above-ground buildings have also increased considerably. Two inclined shafts were also opened in the mine, but they were not completed because the victory came earlier than expected. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Japanese mined a total of more than 2.4 million tons of coal in Huadong Coal Mine. At the same time, because the mining was too fierce, it affected the guarantee period of the important underground roadways and shafts. Therefore, the coal left underground that cannot be mined in the future is estimated at more than 3 million tons. This is a debt that Japan owes to Huadong Coal Mine. Today, the coal mining company's request to allocate equipment from the Japanese compensation materials is very justified. The pre-war output of Huadong Coal Mine was about 1,500 tons per day. During the enemy puppet period, it once mined up to 2,000 tons per day, then automatically reduced it, with a minimum of only 30 to 50 tons per day, averaging about 300 tons. After the company was formally taken over, there was not a single kiln wood, and there was also a great lack of oil. Two years of

Rectification Efforts

Now there is a production of 2,000 tons per day. In addition to self-use, all of it is purchased by the Fuel Management Committee, mainly as fuel for the Jinpu and Longhai railways. In today's widespread coal shortage, the monthly supply of 60,000 tons also has its irreplaceable economic value. The coal mining company is currently actively carrying out the plan to open new shafts. The location of the new shaft is in Hanchang. It has now opened the second layer of coal. After testing, the coal quality is excellent. Driven by curiosity, the reporter walked several miles on the muddy wasteland to inspect the construction of the new shaft. The open space is full of mat sheds, and one side is piled with stones. I drilled into a mat shed and saw a new shaft being opened. The working machine is working 100 meters below the ground. Engineers and workers are lowered with a large hanging basket. Looking down with the naked eye, you can only see the dazzling electric light flickering in the cold and moisture. The engineer went down wearing a raincoat and boots and came out covered in water, as if he had been soaked in a heavy rain. This is truly arduous and down-to-earth Ï∞ΩÂ∑•‰Ωú. A person in charge of the company said: "The cost of opening a new shaft every day is already more than 2 billion yuan. If prices fluctuate in the future, it will definitely be more than this. If the situation changes slightly, everything may be in vain. So it is a risky investment." If there are no unexpected events, the new shaft can be officially produced by the end of this year. After that, the daily

Total Coal Production

In both the new and old areas will be around 5,000 tons. In today's difficulty of transporting coal from the north to the south, it is undoubtedly good news. According to the reporter's personal impression, the staff of Huadong Coal Mine are all capable and competent, and they also show a high degree of interest and enthusiasm for the work they are engaged in. They believe that the current difficulty in the coal mining industry is that the transportation cost is too high. For example, the cost of each ton of coal is about 2.4 million yuan when it leaves the mine. The freight from Jinpu Road to Pukou is 1.6 million yuan, and the total is more than 4 million yuan. The Fuel Management Committee purchases coal and stipulates that the delivery location is Pukou, and the freight is borne by the company. At present, the total cost of production and freight is about the same as the official price, and there is no legal profit. As far as kiln wood is concerned, it is said that the kiln wood obtained from Japan in exchange for goods is of poor quality and does not meet the requirements, so it is directly purchased from Jiangnan. The selling price of each kiln wood in the place of origin is not high, but because of its large volume and heavy weight, when it is transported to the mine after many turns, the cost of each kiln wood is more than 600,000.

The treatment of coal mines for workers is quite generous, and may be in the first place in the various places of Lushaodong Road. Their basic salary is very high, and the salary is calculated by discounting the average of the Shanghai workers' living index. It is said that they are one of the main forces among consumers in Xuzhou. The mine also provides coal for the family use of employees. In addition, there are hospitals, elementary schools for children, vocational schools for industrial and mining, and supply departments for employees. Due to the reasonable treatment and welfare system, the work efficiency is very high, and there are no large-scale labor disputes. In the pacification area close to the front, production depends on

Military Cover

To proceed. In particular, coal mines are regarded by the Communists as a major target for destruction. A cruel destruction may make it impossible to resume work for one or two years. Therefore, since last year, the central government has also regarded the protection of coal mines as an important task of the national army. In addition to its own three major mine police teams, Huadong Coal Mine also has national troops stationed in the mine to jointly undertake defense. The headquarters of the Third Pacification District is also in the coal mining company. The senior military officers of the headquarters attach great importance to the task of protecting the coal mine. One of them even said: "The importance of coal mine is better than 100,000 troops." In fact, due to their meticulous protection, the coal mine has never been destroyed by the Communists. In the past two or three years, due to the education of the actual environment, military personnel have generally improved their political and economic knowledge, which was not the case ten years ago. The coal mine has not failed those who protect it, because the latter also share their welfare measures. I heard in the Tenth Pacification District that the officers there envy the residential housing, water and electricity, and free schooling for children of the officers stationed in the mine.

The delegation leader, Acting Commander Sun Fang, fell ill on the eve of flying to Nanjing after three months of social engagements. This influential figure in the Sichuan-Kang Border Region joined the army at the age of sixteen. In 1923, due to military merit, he was promoted to battalion commander in the Eighth Division of Chen Hongfan's Sichuan army, working alongside Liu Wenhui, the Chairman of Xikang Province. Therefore, in terms of seniority, he is the foremost among the Yi people. He has lived for fifty-five years and only ever been to Chengdu. He had long wanted to lead a group of important Yi figures on an inspection tour to the interior, but was hindered by communication barriers with the Han Chinese. Today, being able to accompany Yi affairs delegation leaders Luo Daying, Luo Zhenjiang, Guoji Mada, and others away from Xichang is truly a earth-shattering event in the eyes of the Yi people.

Last year, Guoji Mada was still the "Commander-in-Chief for Suppressing the Han" in the Puxiong Yi region, possessing eight thousand new-style rifles. Last year, a military plane flying from Xichang crashed over Haitangxi in Chongqing, and a major general-level section chief from the Xichang headquarters also perished. Yin Lidi (Han name: Li Shian), a national representative from the Sichuan-Kang border region who is proficient in Han Chinese affairs, joked to our reporter this evening at a banquet hosted by Chongqing notable Mr. Zheng Hongfu for the inspection delegation: "That plane was going to bomb Puxiong." Now, the Yi and Han in Puxiong are one family. Yi affairs delegation leader Guoji Mada repeatedly stated: He has decided to follow Commander He Guoguang's wishes and establish a administrative bureau. All of this must be attributed to the decades of effort by Acting Border Pacification Commander Sun Fang to promote Han-Yi relations.

Deng Xiuting, the Border Pacification Commander of Ningyuan Prefecture, passed away in June 1944. His family is the most esteemed in Ningyuan Prefecture today. He and Sun Fang once served together as regimental commanders in Yang Renan's Ningyuan Prefecture Qingxiang (Purification) General Command. After Yang stepped down, Deng reorganized it into the Border Pacification Command, with Sun serving as deputy commander and regimental commander. According to Yi customs, the Border Pacification Commander position is hereditary. His son, Deng Deliang, in his twenties, graduated from infantry school and is currently reporting for duty in Nanjing. The security of Yi affairs in the Sichuan-Kang Border Region is actually the responsibility of Acting Commander Sun Fang. "Eliminating the violent and pacifying the good" is the slogan promoted by Sun Fang. It is said that originally, the city gates of Xichang could not be opened casually. In Ningyuan Prefecture's nine counties, three bureaus, and twenty-six districts, Liu Wenhui only stationed one regiment. Without the nine Yi affairs regiments under Sun Fang's leadership (plus one regiment of regular army, including Han and Yi soldiers) to maintain local order, the border affairs would have been unimaginable.

The two Yi affairs regimental commanders, Luo Daying and Luo Zhenjiang, are always filled with reverence for Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang visited Xichang during the war, and Madam Chiang gave them silk handkerchiefs, which they have not yet used. They know that Chairman Chiang will definitely be elected president because "he is bigger than Liu Wenhui." Luo Zhenjiang also said: Bai Chongxi should also be vice president.

When our reporter told them that the *Shen Bao* had already published the photo of them with Director Zhu Shaoliang, Luo Daying replied: "Our Yi people don't have newspapers. There is a Luo Zhenghong in the inspection group who is very good at Yi language. There is a plane returning to Xichang tomorrow, and we have already asked him to write a long letter tonight to send out. The Han people's affection for the Yi people can surely be transmitted to the ears of millions of Yi people through this letter." (Our Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)

### Yao Ci Bandit Raids: Telephone Lines Cut

[Our Yuyao Dispatch, 28th] In recent days, the bandit gangs of Chen Buyi, Zhu Zhiguang, and Ding Youcan, who have been roaming within Yao and Ci, have been intensifying their disturbances. Since the night of the 25th, after Chen's bandits raided Lubu, the Second Battalion of the First General Regiment of Zhejiang Security Forces stationed at the Yuyao-Cixi border received the report and immediately dispatched the Fourth and Fifth Companies, together with the First Company stationed in Xiaolin Town, to encircle and suppress them in the mountains near Lubu. By the evening of the 26th, they had not returned to their posts. Chen's bandits believed there was an opportunity and attempted a large-scale encirclement of the Sixth Company stationed in Zhongcun. Therefore, at around 11 p.m. that night, they gathered about two hundred remnants of Zhu Zhiguang's bandits and adopted an encirclement formation towards Zhongcun, cutting off all telephone lines from Liangnong to Zhiling, and from Liangnong to Zhongcun, Shangyu, in the urban area, to prevent outside interference. Fortunately, the company had received prior warning. Company Commander Wu commanded all the soldiers to defend the bunkers and respond calmly. The two sides bombarded each other fiercely, with machine gun fire audible for dozens of miles around. From 1:30 a.m. until dawn at around 4 a.m. on the 27th, the bandits' ammunition was almost completely exhausted, and they suffered heavy casualties. They finally fled westward towards Yantou. When the bandits passed through Shangzhuang, they again seized more than thirty civilian laborers to carry the wounded bandits. According to reliable information, the bandits suffered heavy casualties in this battle, with more than thirty confirmed, including seven or eight dead. Five rifles were also captured. All of the damaged telephone lines were repaired by yesterday afternoon and are now functioning normally.

### Jiangxi Adds More Counties to Martial Law Districts

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 25th] The Jiangxi Provincial Government previously designated twenty-one counties in northern Jiangxi (Wuning, Xiushui, Pengze, Hukou, Jiujiang, Ruichang), western Jiangxi (Tonggu, Wanzai, Yichun, Fenyi, Yongxin, Ninggang), eastern Jiangxi (Shangrao, Guangfeng, Qianshan), and southern Jiangxi (Dingnan, Qiannan, Longnan, Xinfeng, Dayu, Chongyi) as martial law districts. Now, to adapt to the need for mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, it has added twelve more counties to the martial law list: Fuliang, Dexing in northern Jiangxi; Pingxiang, Shangchuan in western Jiangxi; Ganxian, Nankang, Shangyou, Anyuan, Xunwu in southern Jiangxi; and Guixi, Wangshan, Yiyang in eastern Jiangxi. Furthermore, the counties previously designated as pacification zones, namely Xiushui, Tonggu, Jiujiang, Ruichang, Wuning, Jingan, Yongxiu, Xingzi, and Dean, will have cases involving bandits and those obstructing transportation and destroying facilities handed over to the security commands of each zone for military trial.

### Hua Jia Bandit Leader Zhi Pin-san Arrested While Sheltering from Rain in Dilapidated Temple

[Our Mingguang Dispatch, 27th] Zhi Pin-san, the bandit leader who has been running rampant in the border areas of Hua and Jia counties for many years, was arrested while disguised and sneaking into our territory for reconnaissance, as he was sheltering from the rain in a dilapidated temple in Daijiaxiang Township, Xuyi County, after being recognized by someone. The Daijiaxiang Township Office then dispatched troops to escort him to Mingguang and handed him over to the Fifth Administrative Region Commissioner's Office of Anhui. It is now known that Commissioner Xuan has escorted the prisoner to the Eighth Pacification Zone Headquarters in Bengbu for legal proceedings.

### Firearms of Communist Bandits Seized in Land God Shrine in Changzhou; Hidden by Bandit Han Shaogen

[Our Wujin Dispatch, 28th] The Fourth Security Company of the county recently seized a communist bandit-hidden machine gun, two rifles, four hand grenades, more than two hundred rounds of machine gun and rifle ammunition, two Arisaka rifle bolt carriers, one round bag, and one landmine in the Earth God shrine in Baiyangli, west of Liantang in the old Fifth District. The company then took the firearms and suspect Du Lao-san and others into custody. According to their confession, these firearms were hidden by Han Shaogen (also known as San Heshang), the captain of the Chengwu Industrial Army of the bandits. Han recently fled to Shanghai to hide because the situation had become tense.

### Jin Bihui's Last Act: Dissolved Like "A Speck of Snow"

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 26th] The female spy Jin Bihui finally ended her life on the morning of March 25th at the First Prison of the Hebei Higher Court in Beiping. She had repeatedly requested a retrial and appealed, but to no avail. The final rejection ruling on her appeal was delivered to her at three o'clock on the morning of her death. Jin Bihui had sensed the signs of death a few days ago, and her conversations with people revealed a hopeless indifference. She was initially very confident that she would not die, but after learning that the Supreme Court had approved the death sentence, she knew that she would not survive.

Jin's residence was Room 3, Unit 1 of the Women's Prison in Yaojiajing First Prison. It is said that when she received the rejection ruling on her appeal from the guard at 3 a.m., she seemed to sense that the end of her life would be within hours. So she knocked on the wall, telling Li Ming, the traitorous actress next door, to tell Li Ming's young daughter not to cry when it got light, because she would be sleeping forever. Sure enough, at 5:30 a.m., the guard woke her up and told her to put her fingerprint on a document. Jin Bihui did not know that it was the execution at this time. Her hair was not combed, her face was not washed, and she put on her prison clothes and sleepily followed the guard out, walking through a small door that was not usually used. When she saw four bailiffs standing opposite her, she suddenly became aware of the danger and stood there in a daze, looking back desperately at Zhao Aizhen, the head of the women's prison who had treated her well, but Zhao uneasily avoided her gaze.

Four bailiffs firmly grabbed her arms and pushed her towards the open space in the southeast corner. At this time, the sky was slightly bright, and the east was a dim fish-belly color. Prosecutor He Chengbin sat behind the desk in the open space. The bailiffs pushed her in front of him:

"This prosecutor is here to carry out the order." Jin Bihui was still very smart and beautiful before her death. She no longer hesitated and asked for paper and pen to calmly write a will to her adoptive father Kawashima Naniwa and the warden, etc. Her hand did not tremble, and her face did not change color. After the will was written, the prosecutor asked Jin Bihui:

"Is there anything else to say?"

"No, please give this will to my father!" "I will definitely pass it on to him." Then he ordered the guards to bring two steamed buns and a bottle of wine, but she refused. The prosecutor ordered the bailiffs to push her to the execution. Without being tightly bound, and without excessive force, Jin Bihui turned to the west. After walking more than ten steps, she followed the bailiff's order to kneel down. With a "thud," the first shot misfired. The second shot went out and hit the back of Jin Bihui's head. The bullet went out from the bridge of her nose, and a stream of blood flowed onto her face. Her body trembled slightly and fell forward. This was at 6:40 a.m. on the 25th. The corpse was then moved by the bailiffs into a thin rectangular wooden box that had been used by many prisoners and carried out, stopping on the side of the main road outside the west gate. The people living nearby who heard the gunshot all rushed to surround and look at the corpse. An old lady said, "Every time this door opens, a dead body is carried out." Afterwards, the reporters were led to see the corpse and heard some of the words above. Someone who was related to Jin Bihui said, "The most regrettable thing is that they didn't even let her change clothes!" Jin Bihui was wearing a gray prison uniform, with a purple-red sweater and blue woolen pants underneath. The white cuffs that she used to wear were still visible on her sleeves, and the white socks and blue shoes were stained with dirt. Blood stains covered the upper half of her face, and her short hair was matted with clotted blood on the wooden board. Until noon, a Japanese monk, Tanigawa Daikyo, and Hirose from the Liaison Section, came in a large truck to collect the corpse. They wrapped Jin Bihui's belongings in three large packages and drove east with Jin's body at a little after three o'clock.

On the morning of the 26th, according to Japanese funeral rites, Jin Bihui was finally cremated at the Eastern Suburban Cremation Ground left by the Japanese.

Jin Bihui's life finally ended like this. Jin Bihui truly was, as she herself said, "A speck of snow beside a raging fire!" This speck of snow has melted. (Our Reporter Song Shaobo)

Jin Bihui's only relative in Beiping, her cousin Jin Youzhen, full name Xianyun, served as the person who collected the corpse after Jin Bihui was executed.

### General Chennault on American Policy Toward China

Copyright of Scripps Howard United Press Association. Translated by Our Translation Department.

(3) "The Dinner Table Front" in Chongqing

During portions of our wartime alliance with China, chronic tensions in Sino-American relations transformed the Chongqing dinner table into a curious propaganda front. On this front, Americans praised the Chinese Communists and criticised the Chinese Central Government. This situation reveals the grave errors of our wartime policies and the mentality behind them.

The root of this error lay in the failure of certain Americans to accept the slogan which the Communists themselves advocated, namely: "The Communist objective formerly was Chinese, but is now world revolution." In wartime and after the war, we needed to choose between the two: do we aid Communism, or support a government which emulates our own pure political and social ideals? Until recently, we remained undecided. But apart from this tragic irresolution, I am certain that our official wartime encouragement of the Chinese Communists placed an unnecessary pressure on the Central Government; it handily replaced American dealings with the Chongqing Government on the basis of mutual respect and mutual understanding.

This pressure takes the form of the formally recognised tactics of "intimidation, entreaty, admonition, and public uproar." These tactics have become the standard procedure of our dealings with the Chinese. This is unnecessary; this point was proven by General Wedemeyer, Stilwell's successor.

American aid to the Communists in Chongqing to increase pressure, is akin to playing with fire. The Central Government, however weak it appears to some American observers, still possesses sufficient power to resist such pressure. Until Wedemeyer's arrival, Sino-American relations deteriorated, and we should be thankful for this point.

In China's grim and devastated wartime capital, social life centered on banquets and cocktail parties. American officers turned them into lectures on the propaganda of the Yan'an Reds and criticisms of the Central Government.

Even among senior officers under Stilwell's command, there was little caution in these matters. The good impressions American observers received in Yan'an, however swiftly they disappeared, spread very widely. "The CCP are not true Communists, they are merely peasant reformers," became the talking point.

The Chongqing "dinner table front" became a center for hypocritical and absurd pronouncements, which deeply deceived the American public, of this I have no doubt. The influential tables in Chongqing became a "battlefield" of anti-Chiang and pro-Communist sentiment. On the other hand, the US military headquarters and press conferences were also the command and observation posts for this propaganda. The US military headquarters and the CCP headquarters both maintained close contact with the press conferences, or the press conferences maintained contact with them.

Although the Central Government and the US military authorities separately inspected the news telegrams sent out, primarily and secondarily respectively, it was difficult to prevent omissions or biases, and utterly impossible to prevent reporters from distorting the facts after they left. American censorship in Chongqing was limited to protecting American military secrets.

The American reporters stationed in Chongqing were the best audience for the beautiful depictions of the CCP and the dark tales of governmental corruption and incompetence.

Chinese and foreigners alike easily confided in Stilwell's subordinates, few of whom were governmental figures, but mostly CCP figures or those sympathetic to the CCP.

According to what personnel from the US military headquarters told my subordinates, this unbridled talk had been approved by Stilwell, allegedly as a means of pressuring the Chairman. I believe this is true, but if it is not, Stilwell's failure to prohibit this behavior is an equally great error.

This kind of talk in Chongqing greatly strengthened the CCP while weakening the government's position. At this time, an idea arose: in the KMT-CCP negotiations, it was primarily the government's side that needed to make concessions.

If there had truly been a chance to push the KMT and CCP to reconcile and prevent the CCP from getting involved in the currents of international Communism (I doubt such a chance ever existed), that chance was destroyed by the Americans' actions.

### Blood Splattered the Yellow Flowers: Interview with Veteran Soldier Wu Shi

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 26th] The anniversary of the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang is approaching. This reporter made a special trip to interview Mr. Wu Shi, a veteran soldier who participated in the uprising and is now retired, living by writing and calligraphy. Mr. Wu is old, but his speech is as vigorous as ever. According to him, among the martyrs, nineteen were from Fujian Province. Among them, those from Fuzhou included Lin Juemin, Lin Yinmin, Fang Shengdong, Lin Wen, Chen Gengxin, Liu Yuandong, Chen Kejun, Feng Chaoju, Liu Liufu, Chen Jusang, and ten others. But the actual number is more than that, and the martyrs should be eighty, of whom four were from Fujian, and their names were Guo Dawang, Guo Bofu, Guo Wenlian, and Guo Laohu. The reporter inquired about the current situation of the surviving soldiers, and the reply was: Fujianese Fang Junying (female), Zeng Xing (female), Guo Weiliang, Li Changshun, Liang Dong, Zheng Shengying, Li Hui, and Lin Sichen have all passed away. Those still alive are himself (70 years old), Zheng Lie (now working in the Prosecutor's Office of the High Court in the capital), Yan Ji (65 years old), Fang Yingtuan (68 years old), and Lin Youji (86 years old), all with gray hair and "clean sleeves." In the past, the families of the martyrs could receive an annual pension of nine hundred yuan, but now it is only issued at a value one thousand times that, so their lives are extremely difficult.

Fuzhou Buffalo Competition

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 25th] In order to encourage farmers to protect buffaloes and improve breeds, the Fujian Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Authorities specially held the 36th Annual Provincial Buffalo Competition on the 23rd of this month. More than two hundred units of farmers participated in this time, bringing a total of two hundred and twelve buffaloes. The location was the Fuzhou Public Stadium, and the time was scheduled for 9:00 AM, but because there were too many military positions, coming in an endless stream, so it was delayed until 4:00 PM that the competition was over.

More than two hundred guests participated in the evaluation, including many foreign guests and animal husbandry experts. After four hours of careful evaluation, everyone gave the corresponding scores from each bull's horns, hooves, eyes, sound, nostrils, teeth, ears, tail, udder, anus, and various departments. Among them, in the bull group, Guo Chunren won the award, and in the cow group, Lin Minkang won the award. The prizes they received were also very novel, and each person received a calf.

### Spring's Bustle by West Lake

[Report from our Hangzhou office, 29th] "The lake sparkles, radiant when the sky is clear, the mountain's hue, misty and strange when it rains; If West Lake is compared to Xizi, she is lovely whether lightly adorned or heavily made up." These are Su Dongpo's lines praising West Lake. Since the beginning of spring this year, it can be said that West Lake has been lightly adorned more often than heavily made up. On March 14th, Mr. Pan Gongzhan and female artist Tang Guanyu came to Hangzhou together, intending to spend a week in Hangzhou. However, they encountered continuous spring rain. Mr. Pan and Ms. Tang were undeterred in their enthusiasm for sightseeing. On the first day, they toured Beishan with the reporter. On the second day, the reporter had to go to Gan, so the two of them enjoyed a leisurely tour on the lake in the rain. They returned to Shanghai on the third day, leaving a message for me, promising to come again after Qingming.

Tang Guanyu Paints Peach Blossoms, Pan Gongzhan Inscribes a Poem

After touring Beishan that evening, the three of us dined at Lou Wai Lou restaurant. The waiters at this restaurant all recognized Mr. Pan and Ms. Tang. They brought out a book of inscriptions by famous people, hoping that they would leave some more of their art. Ms. Tang's inspiration surged. Perhaps she was moved by seeing the peach blossoms on the shores of West Lake for the first time in three years after the victory. She casually created a painting of ink peach blossoms, adding a few strokes of willow branches beside the peach blossoms. The painting was exceptionally precise and steady. The reporter loves painting and had never seen anyone use light ink to paint peach blossoms. Peach blossoms are usually vibrant, and it is often more difficult to make light ink pleasing than using colors. However, Ms. Tang's painting was just like West Lake on a rainy day. Although lightly sketched, it did not lose the fresh beauty of spring peach blossoms. Mr. Pan inscribed a poem on the painting: "The peach and willow trees on the embankment compete in fragrance, the misty rain fills the lake with green hues. Do not sigh at returning after the disaster, for today the earth is once again filled with spring." It can be said that he perfectly captured the scene and emotions.

Book a Room for One Day, Pay the Price of Three

In the past few days, West Lake has been experiencing continuous rain again, but tourists are not deterred from sightseeing. On the 28th, the West Lake train from Shanghai to Hangzhou was increased to as many as ten carriages. The hotels were already fully booked, and some rooms were booked until the 20th of next month. It is said that one hotel even demanded a fee before a room could be booked. Their reason was that in order to reserve the room for you, they could not sell it to other guests the day before, and they could not sell it to other guests the day after. Therefore, if you book a room for one day, you have to pay the price of three days. All the corridors of the hotels and any available space were utilized. A straw mat could be rented for 30,000 yuan per night, a quilt for 80,000 yuan per night, and a pillow for 20,000 yuan per night. The temporary business was very prosperous. Recently, tourists have also had wild ideas, and bathhouses, restaurants, and eateries have all been turned into temporary dormitories. There are even many people playing cards all night in cafes. Wealthy people rent a car to use as transportation during the day and as a temporary dormitory at night. It is a pity that the weather is not cooperating; otherwise, rickshaws, handcarts, and boats would also be good dormitories?

Fish is 4 Million, Braised Pork Only 10 Pieces

The business of hotels and restaurants is, of course, particularly good, and Lou Wai Lou and Tai He Yuan are even better. Rooms that were reserved a couple of days ago were temporarily occupied by other guests. The owners exclaimed, "Good business is not good." The people who originally reserved the rooms came and saw the owners' "crying" faces and the situation of these guests who were usurping the place and making a commotion. Everyone came to enjoy the spring, and everyone was helpless. Therefore, they had to negotiate with these usurpers: "Can you let us have it after you've finished eating?" As for the dishes in the restaurants? A shark fin banquet costing 4 million yuan had nothing to eat except for a few pieces of shark fin as garnish. Even the famous West Lake Fish in Sweet and Sour Sauce was missing. A portion of braised pork in the cold dish only had ten pieces. If there were twelve guests, you would have to be forgiven. A shop specializing in set meals was also doing very well, but this type of customer is not welcome in famous restaurants. A customer went to a noodle shop and ordered a bowl of Guo Qiao noodles, which cost 200,000 yuan. The customer was shocked and said, "It only costs 120,000 yuan in Shanghai. How can it be so expensive?" The waiter said, "Sir, just pay it! This is the cheapest!" The Hangzhou Municipal Government mobilized cadres every day to be stationed in various restaurants, three or four in each, to prevent people from escaping the banquet tax.

Taxi from the Train Station to the Lake Demands 200,000

Usually, the taxi companies in Hangzhou wait for customers at the train station every day, and many empty cars return. Now it is very different. Every day, a large number of taxis drive from the train station to the lakeside. The reporter saw this scene in Shanghai just after the victory. Rickshaws, sedan chairs, and tricycles are, of course, charging exorbitant prices. From the train station to the lakeside, which originally only cost 30,000 yuan, they now also speak Shanghainese and ask newly arrived guests for as much as 200,000 yuan.

West Lake boat rentals are even more outrageous. Not long ago, they were set at 450,000 yuan per day. On the 27th, they were set at 600,000 yuan per day. A boat rental costs 3 million yuan per day, and someone offered 2 million yuan. "I won't rent it to you for a penny less." Is Hangzhou really "relying on one spring for three winters?" Is that why they are so unscrupulous in demanding money from guests? And there are so many guests who are willing to pay. The reporter has repeatedly pointed out the reason in the past. Because everyone feels depressed, everyone feels uncertain about the future, so it is better to "enjoy today's wine today." However, this is very different from the ancients' enjoyment of mountains and rivers, and from the intentions of Mr. Pan and Ms. Tang to purify their minds and cultivate their nature through this.

The Crazy Psychology Should Be Corrected

We who live in Hangzhou, especially the reporter, who is a nervous person, feel that both this crazy demand for money and those reckless tourists are committing the same psychological mistake. Today, our realistic environment is not good. This is, of course, an undeniable fact. Everyone is depressed, but we must always find ways to break through the depression. The scenery of Hangzhou is good, but enjoying the mountains and rivers is not just about spending money to have a good time. To enjoy the mountains and rivers, you need to be with two or three close friends, talking and playing, avoiding worldly concerns, and creating a peaceful environment. Only with close friends can you find a way to break through the depression in this serenity. Only then will you feel the loveliness and beauty of the lakes and mountains. Bai Juyi, who contributed to the development of West Lake, had no desire to chant poetry after leaving. He had a poem: "Since leaving the mountains and waters of Qiantang, I have not drunk much wine or chanted poetry. I want to convey this feeling by returning on a boat, to tell the wind and moon of West Lake." Now, more than tens of millions of people have visited Hangzhou, and more than tens of millions of people rely on the spring tourism in Hangzhou for a living. I wonder, after the excitement is over, will they have the same feelings as Mr. Bai Juyi? (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Wang Maogong Explains the Content of Total War

[Report from our Zhenjiang office, 28th] Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang Maogong, at a press conference on the 27th, reported that the Central China Pacification Zone's total war meeting made the following nine important decisions: (1) The commander of the Pacification Zone concurrently serves as the administrative director and expands the organization of the Pacification Zone headquarters and the administrative office. The administrative departments will add civil affairs and economic affairs departments. The commander has the power to uniformly command military, political, economic, party affairs, and people's organizations within the jurisdiction. (2) The Pacification Zone establishes a policy of security, self-defense, and self-sufficiency. The commander will thoroughly control all personnel, food, and materials within the jurisdiction, and implement on-the-spot replenishment and supply methods. (3) The provincial security teams and local self-defense forces within the Pacification Zone will be trained, supervised, and utilized by the commander. (4) The commander of the Pacification Zone has the power to assess, reward, punish, and remove civil and military officials within the jurisdiction in advance. (5) All personnel sent by higher-level agencies to the Pacification Zone are subject to the supervision and management of the commander of the Pacification Zone. (6) The food supply in the Pacification Zone is supervised, managed, and registered by the commander. All surplus grain is either concentrated and stored or purchased at a price under the commander's control to enrich military supplies and civilian food. Important military materials are also strictly controlled by the commander, purchased at a price, or requisitioned, and a comprehensive economic blockade is implemented against the bandit areas. (7) Security fortresses are established in the Pacification Zone to concentrate military forces, concentrate able-bodied men, and concentrate food and materials, which are planned and utilized by the commander. (8) The replenishment of personnel in the Pacification Zone is determined by the commander, who allocates local recruitment in counties and cities. The commander also uniformly trains local forces in the jurisdiction and registers and utilizes local civilian firearms. (9) The land policy of the Pacification Zone decides to implement equal land use rights to achieve equal land rights, stipulating the maximum amount of land ownership and issuing land bonds to grant land to soldiers and enable farmers to obtain land, while vigorously implementing the 30% rent reduction policy. All of the above measures are the full responsibility of the commander of the Pacification Zone, which can eliminate all previous uncoordinated problems and maximize the combat power for suppressing bandits. At the same time, an economic blockade against the bandits will cut off their resource supply, giving the bandits a fatal blow. It can also make our military and civilian needs more abundant. The commander will effectively control the replenishment of personnel in the Pacification Zone, preventing the bandits from coercing people, so as to complete the suppression of the rebellion as soon as possible and stabilize the people's livelihood.

### Refugees Stranded from the Capital Create Disturbances by Snatching Food in Bengbu; Authorities Take Emergency Measures

[Report from our Bengbu office, 27th] The number of disaster victims gathered in Bengbu City is close to 10,000. The local government has set up three porridge kitchens to provide relief, but there are still many who are not served. Recently, more refugees have been sent from Nanjing. A total of five batches, totaling about 2,000 people, have arrived in Bengbu. The municipal government sent personnel to distribute resettlement expenses, 100,000 yuan per person. However, there are many refugees, and those gathered near the train station have been starving for days. In their desperation, they snatched food and grain on the eastern section of the main road near the station and west of the overpass on the 26th and 27th, causing disturbances. Several rice shops closed early and stopped operating because they were robbed. Upon receiving the report, the local party, government, military, police, and constitutional leaders convened an emergency meeting at the municipal government at 11:00 a.m. today (the 27th) to discuss how to handle the refugees passing through. The following resolutions were made: (1) In addition to the refugees already arriving and receiving food at the porridge kitchens every day, each refugee concentrated outside the West Gang will be given three kilograms of rice. (2) Refugees arriving in Bengbu will be concentrated outside the East Gang and given 100,000 yuan for returning home, as well as three kilograms of rice. (3) The elderly and weak refugees who cannot return home and are stranded in Bengbu will be accommodated as much as possible and provided with rice porridge, up to a maximum of 2,000 people. It is also learned that the local military and police have severely curbed the refugees' food snatching to maintain public order.

### Liuwei Ferry Terminal Moved to Xingda, Jiaga Port

Suzhou Determined to Reduce Losses of Farmland

[Report from our Jiangdu office, 29th] The Liuwei ferry terminal, a vital transportation route in Zhenjiang, has repeatedly suffered levee collapses, making it a daunting journey for travelers. After the Suzhou government planned to rebuild it, it was moved to Jiaga Port. When construction began, local residents did not understand the government's good intentions to protect the safety of passengers and gathered to sound gongs to prevent it. The county government convened the local village chiefs to discuss remedial measures, deciding to minimize farmland losses as much as possible, designating public land, building houses to provide resettlement for the affected residents. The dockworkers will be recruited from the affected residents, and schools will be established, all of which will be used as farms, giving priority to providing relief with agricultural products.

After leaving the station, they took a special car waiting from the municipal government and drove directly to the Jinmen Hotel, where they stayed. After having breakfast at the West YMCA, they set off by car at 9:30 a.m. to visit. They first went to the Provincial Shanghai High School, where Principal Shen Yizhen accompanied them to visit the school's dormitory, classrooms, sports field, and dining hall. They then went to the Provincial Shanghai Experimental School to visit the unit design teaching. The units set by the school this week are "Taiwan Research" for the middle and senior grades, "Commemorating the Martyrs of Huanghuagang" for the lower grades, and "Flying Kites" for the kindergarten. Director Xu Keqi and others praised it highly after the visit. The school treated the guests with honey produced by its bee farm. Children's representatives of the school entrusted Director Xu to take a letter from Jiangsu children to Taiwan children, and asked him to sign it as a memento. At noon, the principals of the city's central national schools hosted a lunch at the Youth Hall. In the afternoon, they continued to visit the Municipal Xinsheng National School and the library of the China Book Company on Macau Road.

Seven Bookstores Host

In the evening, the city's seven major bookstores, including Commercial Press, Zhengzhong, China, World, Datong, Kaiming, and Children's, held a joint welcome banquet at the Youth Association, attended by Xu Keqi, director of the Taiwan Education Department and leader of the delegation, and delegation members Hu Bingshen, Ke Chaozhou, Huang Maoxing, Zhang Fangjie, and others. Ministry of Education Secretary Fang Zhimou, Section Chiefs Zhang Zhenyu and Xue Tianhan, Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Secondary Education Director Xie Engao, National Education Director Zhu Junti, Section Chiefs Lu Guanliu and Yan Chunshan also attended. During the banquet, bookstore representatives Li Shizeng, Li Bojia, Jiang Zhicheng, and Zhang Yiqu successively delivered welcome speeches.

Director Xu Keqi and others gave reply speeches, which were very sincere, hoping that the publishing industry would continue to provide spiritual food to Taiwan Province to alleviate the book famine. A Western-style dinner was enjoyed by the guests and hosts, and it lasted until 9:00 p.m. After the meal, the Education Bureau hosted a visit to the Majestic Theater to watch a movie.

Today's Itinerary

The visiting delegation is scheduled to stay in the mainland for a total of 20 days. After staying in Shanghai for three days, they will go to Hangzhou on April 1st to visit for several days, and then travel to Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places for visits. Today's itinerary for the visiting delegation in Shanghai is: 9:00 a.m., visit District 10, Center 1 (Xinzha Road Primary School); 10:00 a.m., visit the Municipal Women's Normal Affiliated Primary School and Kindergarten; 11:30 a.m., visit Mayor Wu at the City Hall, and lunch will be hosted by the mayor at the official residence.

Purpose of Visiting the Mainland

The delegation spent five days in Nanjing, visiting major primary and secondary schools, social welfare, and relief agencies. According to Director Xu Keqi, leader of the delegation, the delegation members were very impressed. They participated in two symposiums in Nanjing, one hosted by the Ministry of Education and one hosted by the Nanjing education community. The Ministry of Education reported in detail on the education policies, guidelines, and implementation. During the meeting, delegation members repeatedly asked questions in Mandarin. The purpose of the delegation's visit to the mainland this time is not to make comparisons in terms of material things, but purely to observe and learn, in order to absorb the culture of the motherland, learn the spirit of the motherland, and promote cultural exchange. Seeing is believing. The delegation members were deeply excited to see that the motherland, after eight years of resistance, is now in a time of suppressing the rebellion, and manpower and material resources are extremely difficult, but educational facilities are still being implemented according to established steps, and new plans and research are constantly being carried out. They are very willing to bring the great situation of the motherland and the happy emotions gained from the visit back to Taiwan to tell every fellow compatriot in Taiwan Province.

Current Situation of Education in Taiwan Province

Regarding the current situation of education in Taiwan Province, according to Director Xu, in the past, Mandarin instruction had to be translated, but now, teachers in all primary and secondary schools are teaching in Mandarin. According to recent statistics, in addition to Taiwan University, there are three independent colleges above the junior college level: the Normal College in Taipei, the Engineering College in Tainan, and the Agricultural College in Taichung, with a total of 1,399 students. There are 123 secondary schools, 8 teacher training schools, and 74 vocational schools, including 35 agricultural science schools, 13 engineering schools, 17 business schools, 2 maritime schools, 1 medical school, and 5 home economics schools, with a total of 86,000 students. There are a total of 1,070,000 school-age children in Taiwan Province, and currently there are 846,000 primary school students, with more than 80% of school-age children attending school. In the future, efforts should be made to cultivate teachers and improve the quality of teachers.

### Accusing Someone of Corruption, Demanding Entertainment Expenses; Two Middle School Students in Beiping Become Protagonists in Fraud Case

[Report from our Beiping office, 29th] A bizarre fraud case recently occurred in Beiping. The victim was Beiping City Councilor Zhang Yangtian, and the perpetrators were Wang Jiye and Liu Peiyuan, students of Huibing Middle School. Because they could not afford tuition fees, they came up with a strange idea and took this extreme measure, which is a tragic reflection of the dire situation of education. On the 14th, Zhang Yangtian suddenly received a strange letter, which stated: Zhang's real estate from matchmakers and kilns came from unclear sources. At a time when corruption is being severely investigated, if the director is informed, people will be separated from their wealth, and the disaster will extend to nine generations. If 400 million yuan is paid as entertainment expenses, everything will be safe in the future. A reply was required within two days, signed by the section chief of the Office of the Ministry of National Defense. On the 23rd, another letter was received stating that the required entertainment expenses must be at least 200 million yuan. A check could be made payable to Wang Shujin, No. 1 Chuanban Hutong, for transfer. On the same day, a phone call was received urging Zhang to pay. Zhang immediately wrote two checks for 50 million yuan and sent them, and reported the case to the police. At 3:00 p.m. that afternoon, two students went to Derunxing Bank to cash the checks. The police immediately captured the two and identified them as Wang Jiye and Liu Peiyuan, both top students from the famous Huibing Middle School in Beiping. Wang was the mastermind, Wang Shujin was his alias, and the motive for the fraud was to pay tuition fees. As for the family situation of the defrauded Zhang Yangtian, it was heard from relatives.

### Teacher Education After the Implementation of the Constitution

‚ÄîHu Shuyi

‚ÄîWritten for the 37th Teacher Education Movement Week

In the difficult task of nation-building, teacher education undoubtedly occupies a crucial position. However, precisely because its position is so crucial, its value is not easily understood and is sometimes underestimated. Of course, at present, there is an urgent need to cultivate specialized talents in the fields of industry, agriculture, military, and government to share the heavy responsibility of nation-building. In this context, teacher education may seem to have a weak and slow function. However, looking around the country, illiteracy accounts for half the population, and the words and actions of educated youth tend toward extremism or decadence. At this time, as the period of political tutelage ends and the implementation of the constitution begins, we are entering the path of democracy. The foundation of democratic politics is local autonomy, and the popularization of national education is the root of implementing local autonomy. Otherwise, how can we achieve national unity of purpose? And how can we cultivate nation-building talents on this desolate ground? Therefore, this heavy responsibility naturally falls on the shoulders of teacher education. I believe that future teacher education should progress from naturalism to idealism and culture, and from individualism to nationalism and the nation.

Academic Research and Professional Training

Teacher education has naturally become a specialized training because education has now become a specialized discipline. Whether in the elucidation of theories, the formulation of curricula, or the research of teaching methods, there has been considerable progress. Thanks to the progress of academic research, teacher education has also progressed. At the same time, because of the rich practical experience of teacher education, academic research has also accelerated its progress. The two are mutually beneficial and inseparable. Therefore, American schools such as Harvard and Stanford have two types of degrees for education disciplines: one is a liberal arts degree, and the other is an education degree. The former is research-oriented, while the latter is professionally oriented. However, I believe that future teacher education in our country should not only aim to promote the education discipline but also make further demands.

Indigenous Culture and National Life

We all know that the composition of society is not just a material arrangement of nature and people. The continuation of society depends heavily on the transmission of experience. Culture is the continuation of social experience. And the effectiveness of our teacher education lies in the teacher trainees who are responsible for transmitting culture in the middle, and then further seeking its development and making it great. We have five thousand years of brilliant culture, but as Sun Yat-sen has shown, we have lost confidence and vitality in the constant difficulties of internal and external troubles. In the future, the responsibility of teacher education lies in deeply excavating the source of our national life, cultivating it, and enabling it to gain new life. We are now greedily admiring foreign cultures, but there has never been a country in the world that can survive by ignoring its own history and inherent culture. Future teacher trainees must understand, appreciate, and grasp the essence of our culture, and use it to influence and nurture the people of the country. Therefore, I say that the professional training of teachers is not only about the development of teaching skills; the promotion of national education is not only about the transmission of knowledge and skills. Education will not be produced without culture. The highest meaning of education is a cultural act. Teacher education should focus on promoting indigenous culture, and teacher trainees should undergo long-term cultivation of indigenous culture. In this way, our country's future education can progress from being natural and utilitarian to being cultural and spiritual.

Liberating from Superficial Utilitarianism

Furthermore, the culture of a country is the spirit of its founding, the soul of the nation. Teacher education is the foundation of national education, and the spirit of a country's founding is entrusted to national education. Looking at the history of countries both at home and abroad, countries that have revived from danger and destruction have almost all done so by vigorously implementing national education and strictly training teachers. I believe that future teacher education should be liberated from narrow individualism and superficial utilitarianism. Education is essentially an interaction in which people form and combine with each other. Everything special and individual only has meaning when it belongs to the general and the whole. A nation, a country, has its common history and common ideals. We must make every citizen live under the same belief and ideal, creating a great "like-mindedness," creating a complete, organic, and interdependent country. Because individuals can only survive by belonging to the state and being subordinate to the nation. This does not mean negating the value of the individual; we firmly believe that only by transcending the individual can the individual develop. I think that we, who have experienced eight years of arduous war and are still suffering from internal strife, should be able to appreciate the significance of teacher education that prioritizes the country and the nation. The people of the whole country should live and progress under the same Three Principles of the People's belief, and those who shoulder this heavy responsibility are the future teacher education. It must create the same belief and the same ideal based on our country's history and inherent culture, and promote it so that the people of the whole country live in such an atmosphere. Therefore, I say that future teacher education in our country should progress from individualism to the nation and the country.

Devoutly Promoting the Ideal of Teacher's Ethics

Moreover, according to our country's history, the position of teachers has always been particularly high. The responsibility of teachers lies in imparting the Way, not just transmitting words. The so-called Way, from the current point of view, is the inherent belief and ideal of a country. The so-called respect for the teacher and the Way is to say that only when the teacher can devoutly promote this ideal can he make it flourish.

I think that if future teacher education can follow this path and promote it, the foundation of constitutional government can be firmly laid, and our country's century-long plan will not be shaken.

Before long, the first half ended, with Qingbaiqing leading 4-1.

Second Half: 3-1

After the break, the lineups of both sides changed slightly. Qingbaiqing took advantage of the remaining courage and launched a fierce attack on Tede's position. Tede tried to stop them. After about five minutes, Jin Lusheng got the ball and advanced quickly. Edward was unable to save it in time, and Xiao Alu broke the net from the left corner, 5-1.

After another ten minutes, Xiao Fei broke in, and Edward pulled up a foot, Xiao Fei's left leg was injured and he fell to the ground, a penalty was awarded, and Yan Shixin gently dialed it over the field, and nothing was gained. At 35 minutes, Tede Liu Zhiguang sent it to Cao Qinfang to shoot, Xu Heng was caught off guard, and the gate was trapped, making it 6-2. Six minutes later, Gao Xiuqing revisited the old place, and a fierce attack from 20 yards away succeeded again, and another contribution was made. Time was up, Qingbaiqing defeated Tede 7-2.

### In Happy Valley, a Goal Lost: Sing Tao Defeats Eastern to Retain Special Silver Shield Soccer Championship

A Pair of Penalty Kicks Decide the Victory

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The Silver Shield championship was fiercely contested on the 21st at Happy Valley. The Group A match pitted Sing Tao against Eastern, while the Group B match featured South China against the Navy. We watched these two matches with absolute delight. In the first match, South China lived up to expectations, defeating last year's champion, which was truly gratifying. In the second match, Eastern, undeterred by the strong opponent, relentlessly pressured Sing Tao, providing the audience with a tense game. It was truly a coincidence that both of these tense matches were decided by a score of 1-0.

Eastern Lost to the Referee

In all fairness, Eastern played exceptionally well, so their loss can be attributed to the referee. The first penalty kick awarded by Referee Yang Ge was baffling even to Sing Tao themselves. The penalty was called when Tsang Sek-hong and Chu Wing-keung jumped to compete for the ball, and Sek-hong was deemed to have slightly touched "Little Chu." Objectively speaking, in such an important match, with only two minutes elapsed and the nature of the foul so subtle, it seemed inappropriate to award a penalty.

Eastern was successful, holding 60% of the offensive throughout the match. If Wai Lam and Chi-fen had performed better, and Tak-kei had provided good support, the situation would have been entirely different. I pointed out earlier that Eastern's ball acquisition relied solely on Fuk-chuen's long passes and Tak-kei's quick shots, but Sing Tao is not an ordinary team, so it was difficult to find opportunities.

However, Eastern's central defensive line had unexpected strengths, controlling almost the entire midfield with an advantage. Tsang Sek-hong was excellent with both his head and feet, maintaining his form from start to finish, which was commendable. Kwan-kan also gave a steady performance, saving Chiu-wing's second penalty kick with a beautiful posture. With such a performance from the entire team, losing the championship due to a single penalty kick was truly undeserved.

Sing Tao Completely Out of Form

Indeed, Sing Tao played completely out of form. The forward line was adjusted left and right but failed to achieve good results. Chu Wing-keung initially played as the center forward but was completely contained by Hansen. In the second half, he played in Kam-ho's position, with Ying-fan filling in as the center forward and Kam-ho on the right wing, but there were still no good attacks.

The midfield line, which is usually full of vitality, had Ling-sing standing behind to keep a close eye on "Jach-lui," and the two midfielders also had to pay attention to defense. As a result, their ability to assist in attacks was insufficient. Sing Tao's victory was somewhat fortunate. From a performance perspective, they were unable to gain an advantage.

First Half Penalty Kick

Kick-off: Sing Tao adopted their usual tactics, launching an attack from the start. Ying-fan penetrated from the right side and crossed the ball into the center. Wing-keung was about to jump for a header when Sek-hong intercepted, and in the ensuing chaos, a penalty kick was awarded. Chiu-wing successfully converted the penalty, making it 1-0. This happened just two minutes after the kick-off. After this, Eastern desperately pressed forward. Chi-fen's shot was saved, and Wing-kwong missed two chances to score. In the 19th minute, Wai-lam passed to Fuk-chuen, creating a good opportunity. Fuk-chuen took a shot from 20 yards out, but it went wide. Then, Sek-hong took a free kick, and Tak-kei headed the ball high, resulting in many attacks but no success.

After 30 minutes, Wai-lam was injured by King-shing. When he returned to the field, Eastern's defense was in trouble. Wing-keung charged forward alone, and Sek-hong's "flying tackle" resulted in another penalty kick. This time, Chiu-wing took the shot, but Kwan-kan saved it. The first half ended with a score of 1-0.

No Score in the Second Half

Second Half: Eastern continued their relentless attack. Tak-kei dribbled forward and passed diagonally to Wai-lam, but "Dee-bo" slipped in front of the goal. Wai-lam got the ball and passed it to the corner of the goal, but Leung Wing-kwong lacked experience and failed to reach it. Once, Wing-kwong had an opportunity, but Yiu-tak missed the ball. If Wing-kwong had passed the ball to the center, there would have been a sure chance, but he shot the ball high. Here, the Tiger team only had one good shooting opportunity, when Wing-keung got the chance to shoot at the goal, and Fung King-cheung rushed forward to touch it, but Tak-bo intercepted it. In the ensuing melee, neither team could score another goal, and Eastern had to suffer defeat in Happy Valley, losing 1-0 to Sing Tao.

### National and Private Textile Industry Representatives Suggest Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Committee to Establish Three Groups for Raw Materials, Export, and Domestic Sales

[Our Report] Representatives of the national and private textile industries in this city, recognizing the numerous difficulties in implementing the cotton yarn and cloth management methods, have comprehensively revised them. They have discussed a comprehensive plan with relevant parties, which National Bank President Chang Chia-ngau submitted to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions in Beijing. The plan proposes that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Bank, the National Textile Federation, the Textile Construction Company, and the Cotton Spinning Guilds of the six regions appoint representatives. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will organize a "Joint Cotton Yarn and Cloth Distribution Committee" under its jurisdiction. The committee will have a business department with three groups for raw materials, export, and domestic sales. The raw materials group will be responsible for purchasing foreign cotton and distributing it to factories proportionally. The export group will manage export yarn and cloth business, using foreign exchange earned from exports to order raw materials and machinery, with the remainder returned to the National Bank. The domestic sales group will be responsible for the distribution of yarn and cloth in major cities nationwide to stabilize market prices. All yarn produced by factories must be submitted to the committee for allocation. A supervisory committee composed of representatives from the textile industry will be established under the joint distribution committee. The Central Bank will provide the necessary funds for the joint distribution committee.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Resume Collection of Commodity Tax on Domestically Produced Petroleum; Tax to be Levied at 3% of Market Value

According to sources from the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, the Ministry of Finance recently stated that petroleum is a mineral product. A mineral tax was previously levied, but in 1942, imported oil was approved by the government for tariff exemption, and domestically produced petroleum was temporarily exempted as well. Now, import taxes on gasoline and diesel, except for crude oil, have been reinstated, and the import taxes on gasoline, diesel, and kerosene have been uniformly increased to 50%. The ministry has ordered the immediate resumption of the mineral tax on domestically produced petroleum, with the following collection methods:

(1) The scope of taxation includes crude oil and gasoline, kerosene, diesel, machine oil, paraffin wax, asphalt, etc., refined from crude oil. If the crude oil tax has already been paid, the amount will be deducted when taxing gasoline, etc., refined from it. If import tax has already been paid on imported goods, tax exemption will be granted upon presentation of proof.

(2) The tax rate is set at 3% of the price. The taxable price and tax amount should be calculated based on the average wholesale price in the market for the most recent month, as determined by the commodity tax bureaus in each region.

(3) The unit of taxation is calculated per "gallon."

(4) For taxed petroleum, a tax-paid certificate will be issued, and stamps will be affixed and sealed on the oil drums and tanks.

(5) No supplementary tax will be required for goods that have already left the factory and are circulating in the market before the resumption of tax collection. However, when transporting goods to other locations, taxes should be levied according to regulations. Goods in storage at the factory should be taxed when they leave the factory.

After receiving the order, the Commodity Tax Bureau issued a public notice to domestically produced petroleum manufacturers in the city, requiring them to submit a list of the names of the oil products they produce, the ratio of petroleum products used, and the average wholesale price of each type of oil to the bureau within five days for registration and taxation.

### Ministry of Social Affairs Establishes Labor and Mining Inspection Office in Shanghai; Li Maoji Appointed Director

In order to promote labor and mining inspection work, the Ministry of Social Affairs prepared to establish a Labor and Mining Inspection Office in Shanghai. Last month, trainees from the ministry's labor and mining inspection training class were sent to Shanghai for practical training. Half a month ago, they completed the practical inspection of 24 major industrial units in the city. The establishment of the office has been approved by the Executive Yuan. It was originally planned to officially establish the office after the staffing and funding were approved. However, due to the urgent need to start inspection work in the city, the Ministry of Social Affairs first ordered the office to be established in Shanghai. The funding will be temporarily allocated by the labor and mining inspection department of the Ministry of Social Affairs. All staff members will be selected from the graduates of the labor and mining inspection training class, with 16 members remaining in Shanghai to work. The position of director will be filled by Li Maoji, the head of the labor and mining inspection section of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The office will first begin factory investigation work. It is said that special attention will be paid to industrial equipment and the protection of child laborers in various factories in the future.

### Jiangxi Tea Sales Suddenly Brisk

[Our Poyang Dispatch] Due to poor harvests in various regions last year, tea merchants have low inventories. Sales in Nanchang, Ji'an, Ganzhou, and Zhangshu have suddenly increased this month. Merchants from other provinces are gathering in Poyang to purchase tea. Tea shops can barely meet the demand. The price of raw tea has jumped from 4 million to 8 million per ÊãíÂá∫ÂÖ≥. The Xiehechang Tea Company in this city has rushed to transport a large batch of jasmine tea and baked green tea from the main factory in Wuyuan to Poyang for sale.

### Utilizing Agricultural Reclamation Machinery to Increase Grain Production

Management Office Formulates Allocation and Loan Measures

The Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee, based on the existing plan for the disposal of various machinery agricultural reclamation materials, has drafted measures for the allocation of agricultural reclamation machinery to agricultural institutions and universities for grain production. It is reported that the measures have been discussed at the business meeting of the office and submitted to the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee and the Management Committee for approval and implementation. The draft measures are as follows: (1) National or provincial agricultural institutions or agricultural colleges wishing to use agricultural reclamation machinery to increase grain production may apply to the office for allocation. (2) Applying institutions and schools should submit a work plan for utilizing the various agricultural reclamation machinery applied for, a budget, and a farm map to the office for review.

### Anhui Fragrant Mushrooms Poor Harvest

Due to frequent snowfalls last winter, the development of winter mushrooms in Anhui was strong. The continuous spring rain resulted in a poor spring mushroom harvest. The number of people growing them is not high, and the production volume is also low. Currently, the price of mushrooms is around 300,000 per catty.

### Jiangxi Sugarcane Production Abundant; Provincial Government Plans to Restore Sugar Factory

[Our Poyang Dispatch, 25th] Jiangxi Province is located in the temperate zone with fertile soil. Especially the counties bordering Guangdong and Fujian in the southeast have entered the subtropical zone, which is most suitable for sugarcane planting. The most abundant production areas are Leping, Poyang, Wannian, Dexing, and Fuliang in the Raohe region; Ganxian, Nankang, and Dayu in the Ganhe region; and Linchuan and Chongren in the Fuhe region.

Among the above-mentioned production areas, Leping has the largest output. Therefore, the sugar production industry also thrived in the areas where sugarcane production is abundant in this province. Sugar production ranks third in the country, after Sichuan and Guangdong. At its peak, annual output was about 300,000 Á•ñ. The types of products include both red and white sugar in southern Jiangxi, while the rest are all brown sugar. However, due to poor manufacturing methods, sugar factories are often temporarily set up during the sugarcane harvest for production, and molasses cannot be separated. The quality is rough, so sales are limited to within the province, and half is consumed locally. The sugar industry has been difficult to develop.

Before the war, the provincial authorities had once planned to establish a fine sugar factory, but it was not implemented due to various reasons. In March 1937, Reici De, a consultant of the Ministry of Finance, came to Jiangxi to investigate the raw materials for wine-making plants and inquired about opinions on establishing a new large-scale sugar factory. He also discussed it in detail with the Industry and Commerce Administration Office. Regarding the location of the sugar factory, Nankang and Leping were chosen as potential sites. Leping is a major station along the Jinggan Railway, close to the Zhegan Railway; Nankang has the Gan River and highways connecting it, and both places have considerable transportation advantages. After Reici De's consultation, he greatly appreciated the important points contributed and promised to convey the opinions to the Ministry of Finance for selection. In the autumn of the same year, Director Gong Xue of the Construction Department went from the province to Hangzhou and then to Shanghai to contact the financial community in Shanghai to solicit shares for joint operation, with a capital of 1 million yuan, half from government and half from merchants. However, due to the outbreak of the war, neither the Nankang nor the Leping factories were built.

Recently, Xingye Company decided to establish a sugar factory in Ganxian to restore the sugar industry in the province. The required working capital is 1.5 billion yuan, and a loan has been negotiated with the bank. The factory is expected to produce five types of sugar: top-grade, medium-grade, white sugar, brown sugar, top leaks, and bottom leaks. It is estimated that the annual output will be 4,500 Â∏ÇÁ•ñ. It will proceed with the purchase and production of sugarcane when the local sugarcane is harvested.

### Agricultural Bank Provides Loans to Support Jiangxi Paper Production

[Our Poyang Dispatch] The counties of Shangrao, Guixi, Shicheng, Qianshan, Yiyang, Yushan, Dexing, etc., in eastern Jiangxi have the most abundant paper production. The yellow and whiteÂ∞ñ,Â§πÁâà,ËøûÂè≤,ÊØõËæπ,‰∫¨‰ªø,ÂÖ≥Â±± paper produced are all gathered at Ê≤≥Âè£ and transported to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Hubei for sale. Recently, due to increased costs, paper makers lack funds for operation, and production has sharply decreased. In order to solve the domestic paper shortage and support the paper industry production in eastern Jiangxi, the Jiangxi branch of the Agricultural Bank has decided to provide loans directly to paper makers in the Qianshan and Shicheng production areas and send personnel to guide them to improve manufacturing methods and improve quality.

### Bank of Taiwan Promotes the Four-Digit Counting System

[Yaguang News Agency, Taipei Dispatch] The Bank of Taiwan believes that the Western numeral system's reading method, in addition to the basic One, Ten, and Hundred, is Thousand, Billion, and Trillion above that. Each is separated by three digits. Therefore, when writing numbers, an apostrophe is added every three digits. The original purpose is to make long numbers clear by adding apostrophes to separate the digits, making them easier to read. For example, the number "600,000" is written as 600,000 by Westerners, read as Six Hundred Thousand, which is extremely convenient. However, in our country, there is no habit of reading 600,000 as Six Hundred Thousand. If we still want to ask about the Western-style three-digit apostrophe separation method, it is really a case of putting Zhang's hat on Li's head, incongruous and inappropriate, merely having the form of adding apostrophes without the effect of separating digits. According to our country's numeral reading method, it is divided into four digits and advanced by one level. Above the thousands place is the ten thousand place, and ten thousand ‰∏á is a hundred million ‰∫ø, and ten thousand hundred million is a trillion ÂÖÜ. The government has clearly stipulated that it is different from the Western numeral reading method. Therefore, the digit separation method in our country should be changed to a four-digit apostrophe separation, which is more appropriate. For example, 456.78 million is written as 45678,0000, which is not only easy to write but also easier to understand. If the Western writing method is used as 456,780,000, unless the Western reading method is changed to read 456 million 780 thousand, i.e., (Four Hundred Fifty Six Million, Seven Hundred Eighty Thousand), otherwise it will be blurred and difficult to read. Unless you memorize the digits of each apostrophe or count each digit one by one, it is difficult to read quickly. In order to meet the national conditions, facilitate the writing and reading of numbers, and correct past bad habits, the bank has specifically changed the numbers to the nationalized digit separation method of consistent writing and reading of four-digit apostrophes from April 1, 1948, and requests all circles to respond and promote its use.

### Comparison of Wool Fabric Market Prices This Month

Looking back at the wool fabric market prices this month, there has never been such a large and rapid increase in any previous period. The most important factors for this sharp rise are: the soaring prices of gold, paper money, rice, yarn, silk, oil, cigarettes, soap, side dishes, and daily necessities, the drastic increase in public utilities such as water, electricity, and transportation, the unstable and uncertain situation, the entry of Northeast circulation coupons into the customs, the influx of speculative funds into this city, the crowd of people rushing to buy goods, the increasing exchange rate, and the decreasing value of legal tender. Now, we have selected and published several types of market prices this month. Compared to the red plate price on March 15, the average increase in 40 days reached 2.75 times.

Commodity March 5 March 15 March 25 February 15 Increase Rate

100 Light Plain Serge 1.9 million 2.5 million 2.75 million 1.15 million 2.5 times weaker

301 Plain Hua WeiÂë¢ 2.4 million 3.3 million 3.75 million 1.35 million 3 times weaker

167 Suit Fancy Wool 5.25 million 6.5 million 7.5 million 4 million 2 times weaker

Local Factory Medium-Thick Serge 2.2 million 3 million 3.4 million 1.25 million 2.5 times stronger

Also Light Plain Serge 1.8 million 2.4 million 2.6 million 1.1 million 2.5 times weaker

Also Yuan Zhi Gong Âë¢ 3.25 million 4.1 million 4.4 million 1.6 million 2.5 times stronger

Zhang Hua Gray Pilot Cloth 1.85 million 3 million 3.5 million 1.05 million 3 times stronger

American Zang Maier Dun 1.6 million 2.25 million 2.75 million 1 million 2.5 times stronger

The above are the wholesale market prices per yard, with retail prices slightly higher.

### Current Status of Copper Product Production and Sales in Shanghai (Continued)

‚Äî Qin Hao

There are currently fifteen or sixteen copper rolling mills in the city. At their peak production (1946), these mills could produce approximately 1,878 tons of copper sheets, 666 tons of copper wire, and 18 tons of copper tubes per quarter.

Regarding quality, the pure copper sheets produced by the mills lack adequate hardness due to technical deficiencies, and are not yet widely suitable for industrial needs. Therefore, the mills currently focus on producing brass sheets. The composition of these brass sheets is approximately 66-67% copper and 33-34% zinc. Recently, due to the high cost of raw materials, many manufacturers have been adding scrap copper to reduce costs, resulting in a gradual decline in quality.

Regarding raw materials, the domestic supply has been scarce due to transportation disruptions in recent years, forcing the mills to rely entirely on foreign supplies. Among foreign raw materials, Mexican "3T" copper ingots are the most popular. However, since the government implemented import restrictions, the availability of foreign materials has also become problematic. Therefore, mills must also purchase scrap copper from the market to sustain production.

Last year, the Shanghai Copper Rolling Industry Association applied to the Export-Import Control Committee for the second term (May, June, July) to import 14,747 dan of pure copper, 18,863 dan of brass, and 5,720 dan of zinc. However, the actual amount allocated was very small, making the raw material supply very difficult.

B. Metal Smelting Factories: The Shanghai Metal Smelting Industry Association currently has over 230 members. The association is located on East Zhongzheng Road, and Mr. Songling is the person in charge. The larger member factories of the association primarily focus on smelting cast iron, with copper smelting being only a secondary business. Among them, Shanghai Iron & Steel Company has the largest scale and is a leader in the iron and steel smelting industry in Central China. These factories are effectively prototypes of heavy industry. Their products include pipe fittings, machinery, castings, valves, vehicle parts, textile machine parts, pliers, cigarette machines, and weaving machines.

Smaller factories are mostly copper sand casting plants, with staff ranging from just a few to a dozen people. Their products include drying pans for laundry, pure copper shafts for ironing wool fabrics in textile factories, bushings on engine axles, and machine parts.

Regarding production volume, the largest factories can forge approximately 60 to 70 tons of cast iron per month. Larger copper and lead sand casting plants produce an average of 150 to 200 dan of copper or lead per month. A prominent manufacturer is Hua Feng. This factory specializes in manufacturing various machines using tinplate (galvanized iron). Because tinplate is strong and durable, the machine parts made by Hua Feng are much more sturdy and durable than cast iron products. Therefore, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, China Textile Construction Corporation, various hydroelectric engineering firms, and the Shanghai Electric Power Company are all happy to use their products.

As for the raw materials used by the factories, in addition to a portion purchased from Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the main source is still scrap metal collected from the market.

C. Hardware Factories (i.e., Parts Manufacturing Factories): The Shanghai Hardware Industry Association currently has over 240 members. The association is located on Haining Road in this city, and Mr. Chu Shende is the person in charge. The largest member factories have 200 to 300 employees, while the smaller ones have only three to five people. In terms of equipment, in addition to common machine tools such as lathes, drilling machines, and planers, they also have various special machines to manufacture various hardware parts, depending on their needs. Brass is the most commonly used raw material. The products manufactured include plumbing supplies, various door locks, zippers, lighters, electrical appliances, watchbands, and watch parts. There are over 120 factories engaged in the above-mentioned industries, accounting for more than half of all members of the Hardware Industry Association. The pure copper industry is smaller, with over 30 factories. Their products include accessory parts for sanitary equipment, electrical appliances, teapots, and rice cookers. In addition, some factories specialize in manufacturing steel parts.

The factories have two sources for raw materials: one is to rely on the Resource Committee, importers, copper-tin dismantling firms, and hardware merchants for supply. The other is to apply to the Raw Material Allocation Office of the Export Control Committee for import raw material allocation. It is estimated that approximately 6 million pounds of raw materials are needed per quarter.

(4) Retailers

The production of copper products in the Shanghai area has been described in detail above. Now, let's introduce the sales situation. Copper products are diverse and have various uses, so the nature of the retailers also varies. They are respectively affiliated with the Copper and Tin Business Association, the Hardware Business Association, the Hardware Parts Business Association, and the Used Hardware Business Association. Among these four types of retailers, hardware stores are the most financially strong and have the widest business scope, making them leaders in the hardware retail industry. The following is a breakdown of each type:

(1) Hardware Stores: The Shanghai Hardware Business Association currently has 449 members, and Mr. Zhao Xianji is the person in charge. The association is located on Jiulong Road in Hongkou. The business scope of each member store is very broad. Because the stores have close ties with importers, they control various imported hardware products. The commodities they deal in include: metal products, including mineral sands and important auto parts; steel products, including bright ground shafts, tinplate, rebar, steel plates, steel rails, various copper products, and iron pipes; machinery, including various textile machines, steel ball bearings, shipbuilding materials, and various drill bits and screws.

(2) Copper, Tin, and Hardware Stores: The Shanghai Copper and Tin Business Association currently has 222 members, and Mr. Xiao Erjun is the person in charge. The association is located on Fangbang Middle Road in the southern city. The main business of copper, tin, and hardware stores is selling five metal products: copper, tin, lead, aluminum, and zinc. However, in terms of their business scope, they can be divided into two categories: dismantling firms and utensil shops. The former mainly deals in metal raw materials and semi-finished products, while the latter specializes in various light household utensils, commonly known as "coppersmith shops," which refers to this type of store.

Dismantling firms are mostly concentrated in the Beijing East Road area. They sell various red, yellow, and white copper sheets, copper wire, copper ingots, thick and thin copper tubes, various colored copper rods, various hard lead, blue lead sheets, lead wire, solder, galvanized iron sheets, zinc ingots, and antimony nickel. Their operating income is considerable. According to the price standard calculation, the average monthly sales can reach 30-40 billion yuan.

The source of goods for dismantling firms is partly purchased from Northeast China, North China, Yunnan, and other places. However, due to the recent transportation difficulties in these areas, the arrival of goods is very limited. Therefore, they mostly entrust importers to order directly from abroad to meet their needs. Among imported goods, copper sheets are mostly from England and Hong Kong, which are very popular in the market. The largest sizes are four feet by eight feet, and fourteen inches by forty-eight inches. American goods are thirty inches by sixty inches, and three feet by six feet. The thickest brass ingots have a diameter of up to three and a half inches, and gauze copper ingots can be as large as four and a half inches. The thickest copper tube is about four inches. In addition, there are phosphorus copper sheets, phosphorus copper plates, and phosphorus copper wire, also from Europe, America, or Hong Kong, which are very expensive, about four to ten times higher than domestic copper products.

Utensil shops specialize in various household items, such as copper door rings, teapots, copper locks, spittoons, copper hangers, candle holders, washbasins, and wine pots. This type of store is one of the traditional handicrafts in our country. Its main sales targets are old-fashioned families, farmers, and temples. Their business is most prosperous in winter, but in recent years, due to the unstable situation and the declining purchasing power of the people, their business is far from what it used to be. Larger utensil shops include Leyuanchang and seven or eight others. In addition to purchasing raw materials from dismantling firms, they also collect scrap metal from the market to supplement their supply.

(3) Hardware Parts: There are currently 482 hardware parts and materials stores in this city. The association is located on Tianjin Road, and Mr. Yu Youbiao is the person in charge. The main business of hardware parts stores is various accessories for building houses, such as sanitary equipment, door locks, screws, Samsung hacksaw blades, triangular drills, and human head abrasive cloth. In the past, this industry occupied a very important position in the entire hardware industry. However, in recent years, due to the lack of vitality in the construction industry, the business situation of hardware parts stores has also been significantly affected, and there has been a sharp decline. Apart from a small portion being domestic goods, 90% of the commodities they deal in come from Hong Kong.

(4) Used Hardware Stores: There are currently over 320 used hardware stores in this city. The association is located on Zhifu Road, and Mr. Ge Shuming is the person in charge. Last year, due to the impact of the market downturn, the industry was difficult to maintain, and more than 100 stores closed down one after another. Although they have gradually resumed business this year, it is still difficult due to the difficulty of importing foreign goods and the difficulty of settling foreign exchange for overseas orders. In addition, the stock of domestic used goods is decreasing day by day, so they are still struggling.

The main business of used hardware stores is selling various used hardware. Some also place orders with Europe and the United States on behalf of customers. The sales of goods are wider in other places, and the goods sold are mainly building materials, water pipes, steel bars, and agricultural tools.

(5) Conclusion

The copper product industry is one of the important modern light industries. Its prosperity or decline is not only closely related to the future of the entire national industry, but also has a significant impact on national defense construction. Although the copper product industry has a long history in Shanghai, strictly speaking, it lacks a solid foundation. The reasons for this are nothing more than insufficient equipment, backward technology, scarcity of raw materials, and financial constraints. Even today, both in terms of quality and quantity, it is far behind the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. In the past six months, due to the rapid rise in foreign exchange rates and the gradual reduction in the allocation amount, the raw material supply has become even more insufficient, while the cost of living for workers has been rising month by month, causing most manufacturers to abandon their main business and compete to hoard raw materials in order to seek temporary profits, which is truly regrettable.

In short, the Shanghai copper product industry is full of sluggishness in both production and sales. The equipment of the two state-owned factories (Central Mint and Central Electrical Equipment Factory) is still insufficient, not to mention the other private small factories. Therefore, if we want to seek the development of the industry in the future, we still need the assistance of the government authorities and the efforts of the industry itself. We must first strive to enrich and improve the equipment and technology, first seek the progress of quality, and then seek the increase of production. At the same time, both production and sales parties should closely cooperate to achieve the effect of fingers and arms. Industry experts will surely agree! (End)

### Dewey on Art and Freedom

‚Äî Jiang Bingxian

In art history, the artist's creative freedom has always been a controversial issue. Art seems to have been a battlefield between "freedom" and "totalitarianism," and "democracy" and "autocracy" from the beginning. The focus of the debate is on "what" and "how" the artist says. In totalitarian countries, the decision on these two issues is in the hands of the authorities. They only want to make art a "tool for imperial use," and they will not hesitate to impose various restrictions on artistic creation, such as setting up a censorship system, banning publications, and buying them off. In order to make these measures reasonable, they often put forward "a supreme goodness," a moral law, a religious truth, or a totalitarian theory, to make people believe that human happiness and salvation must be based on compliance with the country's premise. Plato regarded poets as a dangerous element threatening national security in "Laws." He said, "Legislators and poets are hostile, but if the latter's remarks do not contradict the national laws, he can be tolerated." Plato's view is only a philosophical basis, but it became a religious dogma in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church. Medieval Christians advocated asceticism to seek liberation in the afterlife. Art is a kind of enjoyment in this world, so it is regarded as a sin. Therefore, art has become their slavery under the oppression of the clergy. After the Reformation in the 16th century, emperors and nobles replaced the clergy. Since then, politicians and merchants have been proud to be the "patrons" of art. After the First World War, three kinds of totalitarianism rose: Bolshevism, Fascism, and Roman Papalism. Although they are all similar and contradictory groups, they all took it as their responsibility to drive art. They adopted the same logic to prove the correctness of their actions, and they used the same methods to harm art. In fact, their actions are enough to show that art has a great influence on human minds and thoughts. Art is a tool for heart-to-heart resonance. If art is just the artist's personal "soliloquy," no one will pay attention to it. Totalitarians want to control art because they are afraid that once art is out of control, it will be like a horse running wild, galloping endlessly. The artist's imagination produces many strange thoughts and ideas, and shouts out many brand-new and beautiful nouns. As a result, the artist's imaginary world is often incompatible with the totalitarian reality. Undoubtedly, the rulers will try their best to reject this kind of disruptive thing of liberation.

However, the position of art is different in another environment. No one would destroy art in a free society, because the novel ideas generated by artistic activities can enhance the health and development of a free society. Dewey believes that the enthusiasm and beauty of art, as a result of the enhancement, extension, and purification of ordinary experience, become the mutual agreement of "shared meaning," which unites many different hearts. Every new idea is equal to strengthening the power of this kind of fellowship. The freedom of art is the perfection of a free society. The British poet Shelley believes that the person who pleases is the true creator of a free society and sets the ideal of life for us. This statement is consistent with Dewey's argument.

In the book "Art as Experience," there is a very detailed and insightful discussion on the position of art in ordinary life. This book is compiled based on his speeches at Harvard in 1932. In fact, it is a retelling of Dewey's experience, but this time it focuses on art. Dewey believes that man is an organic body, a part of society. He does not believe that people are born with individualism in this world. He is just a part of the body. In the constantly changing relationship between many other human natures and values, he recognizes his reality. His eternal and urgent request is to enrich this relationship, and this wealth is freedom. The satisfaction of freedom becomes wisdom. In addition to food, clothing, warmth, and warmth, human beings also need a rich spiritual life. Dewey advocates the use of "inquiry" and "re-evaluation" to obtain the free exchange of "common meaning." Wisdom is not a private ability, but a public force, a convergence and popularization of the achievements accumulated over the ages. Personal contribution is just a trickle. Therefore, Dewey extremely hates so-called absolute individualism. He does not approve of the too strict division of modern science. All things in the universe are closely related to each other. Although the methods of learning and learning each form a system on the surface, they cannot be separated in fact. They are all an important part of a "process."

This "process" is the experience of life. Normal continuation. In the process of pursuing freedom and survival and development, human experience is complex and unpredictable. Slowly, we obtain coordination from contradictions and obtain stability from chaos. Then we realize the passionate life in an instant; at this time, we understand that the relationship between the source of life is "law," and the connection of life changes is "form." We call this kind of experience "aesthetic experience." Any kind of experience can become "aesthetic experience." Even the most practical things can become works of art. The creation of art is to cut and polish the raw and shallow things, and give them new value and form. As a result, it becomes "a new material for the accumulation of experience." It is not an escape from the reality of theory to the mysterious world. This new experience changes and expands without interruption with the passage of time. Therefore, works of medicine or philosophy neither predict the world nor explain the world, they only express the world. The value and meaning of both plastic arts and non-plastic arts are expressed by "visible and audible properties." This "property" is the material used in the artwork: such as the clay, marble, or copper of the sculptor, the painter's pigments, and the musician's voice. The materials, forms, and contents used in a work of art are unified and inseparable. Goethe said, "Nature has no core and no number." Dewey has the same view of art. The artistic experience is the unity of "truth" and "ideal," "surface" and "depth," "perception" and "idea." Art gives us novelty and beauty. It does not teach us, nor does it bear any mission. Art is a public language, which is jointly participated in and appreciated by people with different languages and cultures. Therefore, the most important work of culture is to provide human beings with rich aesthetic experiences. In fact, the task of culture is to spread the art of life. Artworks are the most intimate and powerful tools to help individuals work together in the art of life. Dewey said that the world today is facing the arduous task of merging the cultural heritage of the past with modern knowledge. It is obvious that art is most suitable for undertaking this task. Because every art puts "a group of appearances and meanings that have no aesthetic sense in themselves" into "a regulated and rhythmic action that tends to perfection" and becomes an aesthetic experience, this art is equivalent to exemplifying this kind of ever-pursuing convergence.

In short, the essential element of the lifestyle of a democratic society lies in the common life and common experience based on continuous free exchange. This means that art should create an exchange of emotions and thoughts between people and make the people one. As art gradually develops and shines, the world and life will appear rich and splendid. The peak of art is the ultimate goodness and beauty of freedom.

### Aristotle's Method of Learning

‚Äî Buidang

Aristotle's method of learning. On the one hand, it is logic, on the other hand, it is field observation. Logic is the industry he inherited from Plato and expanded, and field observation is his own wealth. Plato's dialectics is actually a concrete and subtle induction and deduction. As long as we open his books, we can see that: every time he discusses a problem, he must first cite examples from daily life, then refer to the generally accepted views in common sense, and then draw conclusions based on the habits and rules of language or words, or establish a concept of a certain type of behavior or things. Aristotle did not oppose this method, and actually used it himself, but he was not very satisfied with it, thinking that it was not accurate enough and not complete enough. Therefore, he devoted himself to adding and revising it. The result of the addition and revision became a special methodology.

As for his achievements in addition and revision, they can be divided into two aspects: (1) Concerning the deductive method. - The deduction of the B-family is based only on the ordinary habits and rules of language and words. A-family believes that this is unreliable, because there are many common errors in language and words, as well as other brief omissions, which cannot completely represent the procedure of thought; as a result of his meticulous research, he invented the so-called three-branch method (Syllogism), and various other patterns and rules on the logic. This has become the true deductive logic (Deductiv logic). (2) Concerning the inductive method. - The materials used in the induction of the B-family are only examples from daily life and views from common sense. A-family thinks that they are not enough and unreliable, because the facts touched in daily life are limited after all, and the views from common sense are often wrong. It is better to go directly to the most fixed and most reliable natural world to find materials. His claim changed the direction of the past induction method and opened a new path for the future induction method. With his claim, there was the induction method advocated by Francis Bacon (1564-1626) later, and the modern scientific method.

Although A-family told us that the materials of the natural world are more reliable, and pointed out the way for field observation, his success in this regard, from the perspective of modern times, is still limited. However, this cannot be blamed on him. He has already done his best. What is left is the limitation of the era. His era had two obstacles that made his achievements inferior to later science: (1) the active trend of thought, (2) the lack of the passive aspect. The so-called trend of thought is the atmosphere of meditation and dialectics of the B-family. At that time, the atmosphere of field observation had not yet begun. A-family can still be regarded as the first advocate. The success of the first advocate is often not as good as that of the successor, which is also the inevitable trend. The so-called lack refers to the lack of instruments. When he was studying at that time, he had no clocks and watches but had to calculate time, no thermometers but had to measure temperature, no barometers but had to test the climate, and no telescopes but had to look at astronomy. All he had was a ruler, a compass, and one or two extremely simple tools.

### Rumor Psychology (1)

‚Äî Li Zheng

A rumor is a kind of oral legend, the content of which is inevitably unfounded, but it is the most primitive form of news. Especially when a country is in a time of crisis, and all news is controlled, and the people are most concerned about current affairs but cannot obtain sufficient information, rumors arise in abundance. At this time, we find two kinds of news in conflict: one is the official formal report, and the other is the informal folk legend. Official reports are organized propaganda, while folk legends are disorganized rumors. But the result is always that rumors prevail. Why doesn't organization generate power in such circumstances? We will discuss this from three aspects: the psychological origin of rumors, the spread of rumors, and social psychology. This article will start with the first point.

In 1857, the Great Indian Rebellion can be considered a famous example of rumors. At that time, the bullets used in soldiers' Mauser rifles were not as convenient as they are today. The gunpowder was loaded in a cartridge, and when firing, it was first necessary to bite open the fat-coated oil paper on the gunpowder cartridge before the gunpowder could be poured into the muzzle and fired. Rumors arose from this small piece of oil paper. The Muslims in the army heard that the oil paper was coated with lard, which they considered the greatest insult, because pigs are considered the most unclean animals by Muslims. The Hindus in the army heard that these fats were beef tallow, and in this way, they would violate the sacred cow and suffer great misfortune. Thus, whether Muslim or Hindu, everyone was angered and rebelled together. After the British government discovered this rumor, it immediately tried its best to dispel it, no matter how it explained or how it used cheese to replace the tallow, but the result still could not suppress the power of the rumor. Why? The origin of rumors has very deep psychological reasons. Indians hated the British government, and the emotion of hatred found an outlet in rumors.

Unless we understand the impact of repression on individual psychology, we cannot understand why rumors are so moving. Many things that cannot be said on weekdays can now be said casually, which is a very pleasant release for repressed emotions. Therefore, ordinary people who would never lie on weekdays, when they encounter rumors, even if they know that they lack a factual basis, they still talk about them incessantly. The reason is, "hearsay," no one has a "sense of responsibility," so-called "just say it for what it's worth, just listen to it for what it's worth." Lack of a sense of responsibility is a major reason for the prevalence of rumors.

The psychoanalytic school says that dreams are due to the psychological phenomenon of escaping responsibility. Therefore, rumors are somewhat similar to dreams, with less rational components and more emotional components. Rumors, like dreams, satisfy desires that cannot be satisfied on weekdays. For example, a subordinate treats his superiors with the utmost respect on weekdays, not daring to criticize them at all. If there is a rumor that is detrimental to his superiors, he will treat this news as if he has won a treasure, and spread it to everyone he meets. For example, he knows very well that his superior is in very good health, but if there is a rumor that he will retire to recuperate, he will still embellish the matter and spread it to others, because this satisfies a kind of desire in him‚Äîthe psychology of disliking his superiors. His respect for his superiors on weekdays conceals a kind of rebellious emotion. The fulfillment of desires Wisn fulfillment, as discussed by the psychoanalytic school, is exactly as such.

Rumors, like dreams, are mostly immoral, or at least more destructive than constructive. This is also due to the irresponsibility of "thus I have heard," just like the anonymous posters and slanderous leaflets. Constructive criticism, or well-intentioned advice, can be said without any scruples, so there is no need to beat around the bush. Only destructive criticism is usually not dared to be said casually, so when the opportunity arises, it is seized, so rumors are mostly bad news, so-called "good news does not go out the door, bad news travels a thousand miles." In addition, people are all eager to win, and always want to be in a superior position. The most convenient way to maintain one's sense of superiority is to degrade the status of others. "Talking about the shortcomings of others" is the usual characteristic of rumors.

In addition, we can find another reason to explain defamation-like rumors. We falsely accuse others of committing crimes precisely because we ourselves want to commit crimes but do not have the opportunity, so we use rumors to vent this impulse. For example, like the fox in the fable, it admires the ripe grapes, but because they grow too high to reach, it mocks the grapes as sour to comfort itself. Many people want to be corrupt themselves but do not have the opportunity, so they are most enthusiastic about exposing corruption. Many old maids like to talk about the impropriety of a certain Mrs. or Miss, and many female students like to spread rumors that so-and-so has a lover. The psychological background is all similar. As the saying goes: "The one who comes to tell you right and wrong is the one who is right and wrong." If one is not familiar with the matter, everything said should be treated as a passing breeze. Who would be happy to mention it? Only things that one is most passionate about are easy to hear and most enthusiastic to spread. The rumors from an individual's mouth project the individual's inner depths.

### About Professor Whitehead

‚Äî Xie Youwei

The recently deceased great British philosopher Professor A. N. Whitehead, his life, works, thoughts, and character have been briefly introduced by the author (see Issue 14 of this publication). The author has much to say about Whitehead. He is a giant in the contemporary intellectual world. His thoughts are rich and profound, and will inevitably become the object of study for future scholars, and will inevitably become the object of diverse interpretations. The author does not fully understand him. However, among contemporary philosophers, there are probably not many who can thoroughly understand his thoughts.

The British philosopher Russell (B. Russell) is naturally also considered a great contemporary philosopher. He co-authored the book "Principia Mathematica" with Whitehead and also studied under Whitehead. He should be the one who can best understand Whitehead's thoughts. However, after Whitehead's book "Process and Reality" was published, Russell went to Harvard University in the United States to give a lecture. Whitehead was the chairman, and after introducing Russell, Russell said: "I do not understand Professor Whitehead's new book very well." The author was also reading this new book by Whitehead at the time, and was struggling to understand it. Hearing Russell's words, I felt a lot of comfort in my heart. But Russell's inability to understand Whitehead may be because their two lines of thought are different. Whitehead said the following when introducing Russell: "When we two co-wrote the book "Principia Mathematica," we agreed on the symbols themselves, but we disagreed on the meaning of the symbols." Therefore, the text part of the "Mathematical Logic" book is mostly from Russell's hand, and the symbol part is a collaboration between the two.

Whitehead's book "Process and Reality" is indeed difficult to understand. Not only Russell did not understand this book, but another famous philosopher, Ms. Stebbing, also expressed difficulty in understanding this book. She published a book review in the October 1930 issue of the journal "Mind". Her conclusion is that either the thought in this book is too profound for people of our generation to judge, or this book is a product of fundamentally unclear thought, illuminated by deep insights. Whitehead was quite angry when he saw this comment. One day, he talked to the students in the "Metaphysics Research Class" about the relationship between thought and language. He believed that language cannot fully express thought, let alone philosophical thought. We want to express existing philosophical thoughts with the limited terms of traditional philosophy, which is bound to fail. The reason why he created many new words and new sentences in philosophy is to remedy this defect. Therefore, those who read philosophical books cannot rely solely on language, but must strive to think deeply and seek the meaning beyond language. He solemnly said to the students: "Philosophy is not a science for armchair thinkers." In other words, philosophy is not a science for lazy thinkers. When reading philosophy, one cannot expect to understand it immediately. If one does not understand it after reading it once, one should not assume that there is a problem with the philosophical thought. This is a sign of intellectual laziness. This sentence made a deep impression on the author, and I hope that Chinese scholars will also pay attention to this statement.

At Harvard University, Whitehead taught two courses each semester, one was a lecture course and the other was a discussion course. The lecture course in the first semester was: "New and Old Cosmology," and the second semester was: "Philosophy and Science." The discussion course in the first semester was metaphysics and the second semester was logic. Some people today say that the elderly should not teach. Observing Whitehead, we know that this statement is unreliable.

### Anecdotes from the Academic World (15)

‚Äî Zhang Qiyun

Modern European and American Thoughts (Continued)

(6) Intuitionism of the Frenchman Bergson (Henri Bergson, 1859-19, regarded instinct as a good child and intelligence as a bad child. The sophistication of instinct is called intuition. He believed that intuition is obtained through introspection, and intelligence is obtained through external contact. Intuition is linked to time, and wisdom is linked to space. Intuition is comprehensive rather than analytical, and can intersect the past and the future, so it has foresight. Bergson believed that the stream of life rushes forward, and the impulse and struggle of life all depend on intuition. He advocated acting for the sake of action, and thought is just a tool for action. Wisdom is like a dream, engaging in pure thinking without being active. Logic and mathematics cannot be positive spiritual activities. Bergson's theory emphasizes action over knowledge and opposes reason. Russell believed that his theory was dogmatic and lacked evidence. Bergson's writing is also in the tradition of Romanticism since Rousseau, and he and reason are in direct conflict. If he cannot reject reason, reason will rise up and overthrow him. If his theory does not stand, then it is just an epic full of imagination, enough to be appreciated. Russell said that the Vichy government in France during the war was related to Bergson's thought because it focused on action and insisted on its own way, which would inevitably lead to conservatism in politics.

(7) Instrumentalism Bacon first created the saying that knowledge is power, wanting to use scientific inventions and discoveries to achieve the goal of humans conquering nature. The purpose of theoretical science is to understand the world, and the purpose of applied science is to transform the world. The influence of applied science on practical politics began at the end of the eighteenth century. Due to the manufacture of machines, mechanical transportation, and the application of coal, oil, and electricity, production has flourished, waterfalls can become power, and deserts can be turned into gardens, as if there is nothing that cannot be done in the world. The speed of progress in modern mechanical civilization and the development of large-scale production are especially prominent in the United States. The philosophy of the American Dewey (John Dewey, born in 1859) reflects the industrial culture of this era, and can be named the power philosophy of instrumentalism. Dewey takes the process of exploration as a synonym for truth, and excessively emphasizes effectiveness, so it cannot avoid the view of judging heroes by success or failure. Russell believed that the success or failure of human affairs may not all be describable. If everything must seek effect, and effect has effect, and there is endless pursuit, there must be no place to stop. The drawbacks of instrumentalism are similar to those of Romanticism, except that Dewey, unlike the Nietzsche school, thinks from the perspective of individual power, but from the perspective of collective power, but both are a kind of power philosophy. Russell quoted Santayana's criticism of Dewey, saying that he "disintegrates the individual and pulverizes the truth," to show his concern. Dewey's school is too intoxicated with the infinite power of science, which is too much. Russell has concerns about this. Now the war potential of various countries has increased due to the progress of science and technology, and if there is no way to prevent war, the result may lead to a general destruction.

(8) Logical Analysis This school is a new philosophy that keeps pace with the times after the invention of relativity and quantum theory in the early twentieth century. Synthesis is based on experience, and analysis is based on logic. Naming it logical analysis can express the thought method of this school. Modern physics, due to the success of atomic theory, has reduced its material meaning, and psychology has also reduced its mental meaning due to the progress of physiology. The two move towards each other, and there is no strict distinction between mind and matter. There is no so-called matter, no so-called mind, only events. This simplified new worldview is called Neutral Monism, or Eventism. The representative figure of this school should be Russell himself. He believed that philosophy should be pragmatic with scientific methods, but it needs to go further than science. Science only asks about causes, not purposes, only asks about parts, not the whole. Philosophy is to make up for what science has not achieved. Scientists before the Renaissance only asked about purposes, which led science to a dead end, which is certainly not worth emulating. The new philosophy encouraged by modern science often focuses on tools and techniques, the so-called "only power is seen," and does not deeply consider the purpose, which also has the disadvantage of becoming arrogant. Russell believed that future new trends of thought must prescribe the right medicine for power philosophy to correct its bias. For the above-mentioned schools, we must adopt their strengths and discard their weaknesses. For all wisdom and action, utility and motivation, political human rights and economic human rights, we must take them all in and not tend to extremes. As for the philosophies of ancient and medieval times, there are also many timeless truths in them that need to be harmonized and integrated to achieve the goal of collecting a great collection. Russell comprehensively discussed the relationship between heaven and man, believing that Greece feared heaven, the Middle Ages respected heaven, modern times valued the self, and the present world valued the group. Each has its own grand purpose and cannot be abandoned. Science cannot encompass everything. He believed that as a result of the progress of modern science and technology, the world has been transformed into a whole, but the structure of politics and society has not been able to match it, and the reason for the great war lies here. Russell's ideal new philosophy advocates neutral monism or eventism in its worldview, and advocates integrating ancient, medieval, and modern times in its view of life, and further integrating the East and the West. We must know the new to warm the old, and then transform from the old to the new. Only with such a sound new philosophy as the hub of the new culture can we adapt to the requirements of the atomic age. Democracy is not without its shortcomings, but it has the fewest shortcomings among various political systems. There must be democracy at home, and it should be the same internationally, so that the world can maintain peace for a long time. (End)

### Schopenhauer's Theory of Education

‚Äî Shaoxiong

Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) of the nineteenth century was a genius and a famous pessimist. We may not agree with his pessimism, but his judgments in other areas often have deep observations and unique insights, which we cannot obliterate. In his collection of essays, there is an article on education. This article has many similarities with the theories of modern educators, and it is worth introducing to us. This is the purpose of this article.

We know that Schopenhauer was an idealist in philosophy. He inherited Kant and made some modifications to Kant's theory. But in his educational advocacy, he leans toward empiricism. He believes that there are two types of educational methods: natural education and artificial education. The so-called natural education is a method that emphasizes special observations and special experiences to obtain universal views or knowledge. Human universal concepts are obtained by abstracting from special observations. This is to be obtained after special observation, after a considerable period of time. A person who has no teacher and no books, his acquisition of knowledge depends entirely on his own experience. Such a person knows very well which of his special observations belong to a certain universal concept, and are represented by a certain universal concept. He knows both special observations and universal concepts very clearly, and he will not make mistakes, so he can handle any event from the correct point of view. This is the advantage of natural education. Conversely, the so-called artificial education is a method that emphasizes oral instruction and books, and is mainly based on the injection of universal concepts. This method is to listen to the oral instruction of teachers and elders, to study, and to read books before humans have had extensive contact with the universe itself, and before they have observed for themselves, filling their minds with many universal concepts. Your teachers and elders will tell you that the special observations that constitute these universal concepts will be obtained in your future experiences. However, before the special observations have been obtained, you will use the universal concepts incorrectly, and you will judge people and things from the wrong point of view, and observe them and deal with them with the wrong views and in the wrong ways. So this kind of education distorts the human mind.

Education does not use natural methods, but uses artificial methods, which explains why many people who read a lot of books and have knowledge often lack common sense, and often make wrong judgments or act wrongly. The reason is that although this kind of person is full of many abstract universal concepts, he just starts to use them, so it is difficult to use them correctly. The education he has received violates the natural development of the mind, that is, the development from concrete to abstract, reversing it, with the injection of abstract concepts first, and special observation later. This kind of education does not first develop children's cognitive functions, nor does it first teach children to observe and think for themselves, but instead uses all of its effort to forcefully inject other people's thoughts and existing concepts into children's minds. In this way, after the child grows up, all that is in his mind are those abstract concepts of others, and these concepts are never all correct, and many are wrong. With these preconceived notions, later experiences can be corrected, but it is difficult to completely correct them, and it is not easy to correct them. In this way, when a person who only has abstract concepts observes a fact that is contrary to his abstract concepts, he can regard the fact as partial, as incomplete, and reject it; he can also completely ignore the fact, deny that the fact is contradictory to his abstract concepts, and try his best to preserve his abstract concepts. This is the reason why many people are entangled by prejudices, illusions, and wrong ideas throughout their lives and cannot extricate themselves. To correct human wrong ideas, this kind of education must first be corrected.

Schopenhauer believes that correct education must conform to the natural development of the human mind, that is, it should be mainly based on natural education. According to this kind of education, special observation should be before universal concepts, and narrower views should be before broader views. Any concept should be instilled according to the procedure by which the concept is constructed, and cannot be overleaped. The concepts that we should give to children must be concepts that children can observe for themselves, and in any case, must be concepts that can be verified by observation. In this way, although the concepts obtained by children are few, they are all well-founded and correct. In this way, children can learn how to use their own standards, not the standards of others, to judge things. He can avoid many misunderstandings and prejudices. Therefore, the way to educate children should not be to put books in front of children first, but to gradually let children come into contact with things and the actual life environment. Our work is to guide children to obtain clear and objective views on the universe, and also to guide them to obtain their concepts directly from practical life, and to make their concepts consistent with practical life. We should try to prevent children from obtaining their concepts from books, fairy tales, and the words of others, because the concepts obtained in this way are mostly wrong and mostly inconsistent with practical life. The main task of education lies here. Therefore, Schopenhauer advocates that before children reach the age of fifteen, all abstract subjects with more divergent opinions and more possible errors, such as philosophy, religion, etc., should not be taught. What can be taught are subjects with more consistent opinions and fewer errors, such as mathematics, natural sciences, languages, history, etc. The teaching of the former type of subjects should wait until the child has grown up, has sufficient experience, and has the ability to judge. Even novels, Schopenhauer does not advocate letting children read, because children are easily influenced by novels and construct many wrong ideas.

Schopenhauer's theory of education is roughly as described above. Although his views have arguable points, in general, they are correct and consistent with the theories of contemporary educators.

### Happiness and Troubles

‚Äî Zhong Ming

There are very few lucky children in the world who have never had troubles, but there are many unfortunate people who have never known what happiness is. When you come into contact with anyone around you, you will mostly find that they are troubled by something. Naturally, you yourself are often likely to be one of them.

People are fond of "happiness" and hate "troubles", but troubles do not therefore seem distant to you. On the contrary, they will still descend on your head at any time, making you unable to get rid of them. Because of this, people often lament that they are no longer innocent children. They think that only children are angels who do not know troubles and are the happiest, and adults are forever entangled with "troubles". Some people also feel that the troubles in the world cannot be isolated, so they entrust their souls to religion, hoping to get some happiness and warmth under the protection of "God". There are even a group of hedonists who feel that life is both short and troublesome, and if they do not enjoy themselves in time, they are really wasting their lives. So they indulge in sensual pleasures and obtain some sensory stimulation, which is what they consider satisfying "happiness".

Undoubtedly, the path they desire and pursue "happiness" is completely wrong. It is a naive idea to hope to return to childhood and live a kind of unconscious and inexplicable "happy" life. It is also a wrong concept to think that if you believe in religion, the god of happiness will descend from heaven. Because even the most efficacious "God" sometimes cannot save you from all the "troubles" of reality. As for the happiness pursued by the general hedonistic school, it is even more pitiful and sad, because they simply do not understand the meaning of life and happiness.

True happiness requires many conditions to be matched. Without a sound outlook on life, it is really impossible to talk about any happiness. These many matching conditions are your knowledge, cultivation, ability to deal with reality, and adaptability to the environment. A sound outlook on life will never simply be fond of the life of childhood, nor will it confusedly dedicate a heart to "God", or exhaust all the spirit in indulging in pleasure. A sound outlook on life can tell you what things should be thought about, what things do not need to be thought about too much, and how to relieve unavoidable troubles, so as to enter the realm of happiness.

Troubles are often an unnecessary loss of spirit. A wise person does not let his precious life pass in troubles. A rich gentleman is upset because his housing lottery ticket did not win, and a wife laments because she has one less son or cannot get a few carat diamond ring, all of which are unnecessary troubles, because they only harm you, without any compensation or construction.

Yes, in the journey of life, you will often encounter many things that cannot make you happy, but you should use your wisdom and courage to overcome this difficult obstacle‚Äîagain and again, fight on. At the same time, when overcoming and eliminating these many troubles, if you want to borrow other forces to help you, it is still unreliable, and the struggle for happiness still depends on yourself.

### Mark Twain's Humor

‚Äî Meng Wu

When Mark Twain's writing career began, although he had a small reputation, his income was still very meager, and sometimes he even felt very financially strained.

Once, a local comedian was willing to pay him fifty U.S. dollars as a reward, asking Mark Twain to write half a dozen "jokes" for use in the play. Unexpectedly, this witty master of humor immediately refused and said to the man:

"If I accept this deal, both of our reputations will be ruined!"

"What does this have to do with our reputations?" the comedian asked very puzzled.

"If you come on stage and perform six very wonderful jokes, then the audience will definitely think you stole them from someone else. They will say you are a thief! As for me, I am a very poor person, often penniless. If people find out I have fifty dollars, they will definitely think I stole it, and they will also call me a 'thief'. In this way, wouldn't both of us be discredited?"

### The Mystery of the Sky

‚Äî A Duan

Zi You Tan (Free Talk) has already published an article by Mr. Sun He discussing UFOs, saying that last year's UFOs were actually American academic national body experimental rocket weapons. But on the 25th of this month, I read a news report about "flying saucers" appearing in the sky over Switzerland: "The Swiss News Agency reported: Yesterday afternoon, a giant ball of light was discovered in the sky over the village of Weinfelden in northeastern Switzerland, and it flew rapidly southward. Later, in central Switzerland, a luminous flying saucer with a long tail was seen again, flying directly west... Our agency's reporter took a train from Turin to Rome and also saw a comet-like object flying in the sky. Although the train was roaring, the loud sound of the object flying could still be heard."

In fact, in the past hundred years, newspapers and magazines have often published news of mysterious "flying objects" appearing. Most people think that the "flying saucer" is the most mysterious, but compared with the flying buckets, flying pigs, flying horses, flying pythons, flying people, flying bells... that appeared in the sky before, the "flying saucer" is really nothing to mention. But why are people particularly shocked by "flying saucers"? In a word, it's all because the international situation after the war is turbulent and uncertain, and people have become much more sensitive.

It is said that in 1878, a farmer in western Virginia, USA, personally witnessed a white horse with silkworm wings flying over his head. In 1905, many residents in Yierqi saw a pair of pigs about ten feet long flying across the sky.

In 1873, many farmers in Texas began to panic, because in broad daylight, a thick python flew over their heads. A New York newspaper condemned this incident as the most "absurd and unfounded" talk, but soon after, "flying pythons" also appeared in Kansas.

In 1881, residents of Virginia and Delaware saw a soldier in uniform and a little angel in white flying quickly across the sky.

The most surprising thing is the flying "cigar". On the night of April 9, 1897, something shaped like a "cigar" appeared in the sky over Chicago, with huge wings and emitting red, white, and blue light.

Scientists also witnessed the appearance of the "flying cigar". A scientist explained that this flying object was the Southern Cross star, which emitted three colors of light due to the influence of the atmosphere, but this scholar did not explain why only the Southern Cross star was affected by the atmosphere.

Later, at 9 pm on April 19, red, white, and blue lights appeared in the northeast corner of the town of Cheston in Virginia. Observed through optical glass, this thing was conical in shape and about one hundred and eighty feet long.

What exactly is this "flying cigar"? What is the "flying python"? For questions like these, there is only this answer: the mystery of the sky has not yet been revealed, and it is still a confusing "mystery". (This article is taken from the February issue of Crown Magazine)

### Five Schools of Visiting Mother

‚Äî Yi Hong

"Si Lang Visits His Mother" is the most popular play in Peking opera. From sitting in the palace to returning orders, it occupies two male roles (Si Lang and Liu Lang), three female roles (Empress Dowager Xiao, Princess Iron Mirror, and Fourth Madam), one old woman (She Taijun), a young man (Yang Zongbao), and two clowns (guards). It is basically a play that emphasizes both male and female roles. Originally, the Fourth Madam was the main female role, and the princess was the supporting female role. Chen Delin played the Fourth Madam in Er Huang Zheng Ban style, and Wang Yaoxiang played the princess, only singing Xipi Yao Ban when she appeared, which was indeed a supporting role. However, later the princess became the main female role and was promoted to the protagonist, while the Fourth Madam became a supporting role instead. Si Lang and the princess are both protagonists in the play, but this play is starred by the male role, and the princess can only be regarded as a supporting protagonist. There are five schools of old male roles performing the visit to the mother, namely Wang Guifen, Sun Juxian, Tan Xinpei, Liu Hongsheng, and Xu Yintang. The performances of these five schools have different advantages, which are written below:

(1) Wang School: Wang Guifen is also known as Wang Datou. He performed "Visiting Mother" during the Tongzhi period. At that time, the singing method did not have any florid embellishments, and emphasized full bowing and full tones, with correct pronunciation. In Xipi Zheng Ban "Yang Yan Hui Sits in the Palace Courtyard," there was usually a short interlude before singing the four words "Zi Si Zi Tan" (self-thinking, self-sighing). The Wang School's singing method omits this short interlude and uses tones to fill in the gaps in the short interlude, completing the four words "Zi Si Zi Tan" in one breath. It is extremely difficult to cope with without true inner strength. This is the only characteristic of the Wang School, and the ending sounds all originate from the nasal cavity. Wang Guifen is the only one who is good at using nasal sounds. Later, Wang Fengqing also learned the Wang School's singing method, but because there were no florid embellishments in the singing, it was not liked by society.

(2) Sun School: Sun Juxian was from Tianjin. People in Beijing and Tianjin call him "Old Fellow Villager" and also "Sun Yile," because Sun is an optimistic person among actors. He regards performing on stage as a game. No matter what play it is, his singing and acting are very hasty. However, relying on his broad and bright voice and abundant inner strength, his voice can shake the roof tiles and stop the clouds when he releases it. It is tragic and passionate, and extraordinary. Therefore, he can also form his own school. The biggest advantage of his performance of "Visiting Mother" is that he can drag out the long tones. When he sees his mother, he sings "Go to the back tent and take a look at my mother's daughter-in-law and son's wife, I'll be right back," and the "lai" (come) character can be dragged out until he enters the stage. When he reaches the backstage, the lingering sound is lingering, and the audience can still hear it faintly in the front stage. His abundant inner strength is like this, which is a major feature of the Sun School. Later, Hui Bao's performance of "Visiting Mother" was also called "Locomotive," which refers to the extremely long tail tone of the "lai" character.

(3) Tan School: Today's performers of "Visiting Mother" have all kinds of florid embellishments, innovate and introduce new things, which is almost based on the Tan School. Tan wins with soft tones, and each paragraph has its advantages. The intonation can be as nuanced as possible. The tone when crying in the hall is sad and poignant, and thought-provoking. Later, Yu Shuyan made slight improvements, but still did not escape the framework of the Tan School. The performances of Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen today are also a compromise between Tan and Yu. However, Ma Lianliang's performance has undergone some changes, but it still does not deviate from the scope of the Tan School. The Tan School's "Visiting Mother" has the most advantages and can be called the most perfect.

(4) Liu School: Liu Hongsheng was an amateur actor, and the play "Visiting Mother" was one of his masterpieces. Liu's voice was high-pitched and his pronunciation was sweet and mellow. Whether it was Zheng Ban, Yuan Ban, or even Liushui, it was all completed in one breath. The "fan" character in "Standing at the Palace Gate Calling the Little Fan" had a sharp and straight upward pitch without any effort. The crying tone uses a high pitch, which is also the opposite of the Tan School. His huqin tune is always above the B character, and only Chen Wenqi, Wu Kunfang, and Wu Caixia can play the supporting roles. Ma Fuxian played the princess for him in "Visiting Mother," and eventually died of vomiting blood due to the high pitch.

(5) Xu School: Xu Yintang was a disciple of Zhang Erkui. His performance was the Kui School's old male role, and the play "Xuan Yuan Rong" was his specialty, which no one else could perform. His "Visiting Mother" can also form its own school. His singing tone is completely a serious Wang Mao old male role, with calm pronunciation and stable pronunciation. It has become a clumsy singing style, which is even less popular than the Wang and Sun schools. He is a backward person in the times, so no one learns Xu's "Visiting Mother" anymore.

Chapter 13: Attempting to Remedy (113)

Zhu Qi said: "She said I was already dead, which shows that she has no feelings for me in her heart. Although I followed your advice and knelt to beg when I entered the door, she may not understand. I think she has already made this decision, and we have nothing to worry about. I want to tell my parents about the divorce and break away from her openly and honestly. In the future, we can proceed together according to the purpose of two years ago, and my father and mother will definitely approve." Yun Xiang shook her head and said, "No! If this matter is handled according to your words, then I will be laughed at and scolded for the rest of my life. At that time, you and Feng Sheng divorced privately, and I was the one who advocated it for her. Now we want to get married. In Feng Sheng's eyes, what kind of person have I become? As far as your family is concerned, your parents will definitely not approve. As for me personally, I have no such hope, because everyone is for the sake of feelings. If a grain of sand is mixed into the feelings, the spiritual state will always be uncomfortable." Zhu Qi said: "What sand? I don't understand!" Yun Xiang said painfully, "I can't bear to say this out of my mouth." Zhu Qi said: "According to what you said, there is no hope!" Yun Xiang said: "Yes, there is no hope!" Zhu Qi said: "Then what is the point of me living? I might as well escape into the empty gate and become a monk!" Yun Xiang said: "You are talking even more nonsense. You have parents above you, and your responsibility is very heavy. How can you say anything about becoming a monk?" Zhu Qi said: "My spirit has no sustenance, and I can't go home. What can I do?" Yun Xiang said: "You should still go home and find your wife. She has a conscience. She was angry with you last night, maybe because you were too reckless. Try going again today." Zhu Qi said: "No! I can't go! She said I was already dead. How can I have the face to see her?" Yun Xiang said: "You are too angry! You have to think that you have let her down. No wonder she is angry. You have to talk to her well." Zhu Qi said: "You don't know her temper. No matter what you say to her, it's useless!" Yun Xiang said: "Logically, I should go and explain to her, but unfortunately I am sick now and can't go out." Zhu Qi said: "I don't think there is any need to do this. Let's discuss our own affairs. You know that I have no feelings for Feng Sheng. Now, even if we force ourselves to get along, there will be no good results in the future." Yun Xiang said: "This is your one-sided thinking. Feng Sheng married you and has not complained that you are not good. Let alone you still have the ability to support her now, even if you are so poor that you have nothing, and she follows you to beg for food, she will not complain about you. Why do you hate such a virtuous woman?" Zhu Qi said: "Your argument is different from before. You used to sympathize with me very much. Why are you biased towards her now?"

### Recent Verses from the Art Building

‚Äî Shi Shufan

Seeing the flowering peach blossoms, I suddenly have thoughts

The grass in front of the building is messy and uneven, my heart is silent and birds are chirping, the peach blossoms shine on the fan and become a new score, the wandering bandits breed spring and remember the late Ming; I sigh that there is no clean land in sight, and there is only melancholy in the world! Asking heaven what plan to save the precarious situation? Wash away the chaos in my heart and liver.

Drinking with Sanmu Baijiao at night

Thinly entrusting life and death to the secluded orchid, it is difficult to live in seclusion in the mountains and rocks, tonight's faint lamp is also a pure blessing, a pot is not the sea but has back eddies. If the land sinks and the thousands of halberds cease, the old man should divide the rest of his writing ink. How many officials laughed at their fingertips, measuring their waists can recognize the exhaustion of the common people?

Falling Plum Blossoms

I dreamed that loyal souls came to roll call, and I woke up to mourn the flowers even more. Heaven ultimately pities the strong and unyielding, and a ground of spring ice buries the falling plum blossoms.

Meeting the seal maker Han Dongan

A dragon and snake are in his wrist, and my heart is still not tamed. The atmosphere of heaven and earth is at the tip of the knife, and the dust of the road is on my hair. The lamps are destroyed in the chaos, and the sorrows are different from those of people in other worlds. How many dreams are there in the city building, and if the inscription can bring back spring!

### Suicide in America

‚Äî Mao Yi

Every half hour, someone commits suicide in America. During the war, the suicide rate was relatively low, perhaps because jobs were easy to find, and everyone was busy and had little opportunity for contemplation and silence. However, when the economy is depressed, more people seek death. In 1929, when the American stock market crashed, a "joke" circulated: There was a tall hotel, and whenever guests came to rent a room, the waiter would carefully ask: "Sir, are you renting the room to sleep in, or to jump off the building?"

Of the 100,000 suicide attempts that occur in the United States each year, 20,000 protagonists succeed. Most of them arise from sudden impulses, usually in panic. Some doctors say that one-third of the suicides are either mentally deranged, drunk, or sick. However, generally speaking, 80 percent of American suicides are due to emotional or financial troubles. But the financial motives are complex‚Äîmore people commit suicide because they have too little money than because they have no money at all. Apparently, Americans can endure real poverty, but find it difficult to endure the fear of poverty.

Someone asked: Is there a more comfortable method of suicide than jumping off a building? - Why is jumping off a building one of the most common methods of suicide? The following example can give us an explanation:

Several years ago, a young man named John Ward secretly climbed up the narrow window of the seventeenth floor of a hotel in New York. His sister frantically begged him to climb back, but he ignored her, so she called the police. However, they could not catch Ward, could not pull him back, and were afraid that pressing him too hard would force him to jump down. Ward's sister and the police painstakingly persuaded him to climb back, but not only did he not listen, he also talked nonsense to them and even made fun of them. After a stalemate for several hours, Ward finally jumped from the seventeenth floor in full view of everyone, ending his life. This fully demonstrates extreme "exhibitionism" (Exhibitionism), which is what is called "dying to show off."

Three times more men commit suicide than women. Men take more drastic measures, such as shooting and hanging. As for women, when preparing to end their lives, it is as if there is a convention among them. They rarely use methods that would destroy their appearance. They seem to "care about face even in death."

Most state laws in the United States consider attempted suicide to be a crime. In New York State, helping and abetting suicide is first-degree murder, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Americans have organized many suicide prevention associations. According to their experience, strangers are more effective at counseling world-weary people than acquaintances. They have also found that if they delay the suicidal thoughts of world-weary people for a few days, or even a few hours, most of them will disappear and they will decide to live - suicidal attempts are nineteen out of ten times a temporary impulse. The impulse is temporary. Once it disappears, even if the person who attempted suicide is forced to seek death again, he will shrink back.

### Spring is not for Reading

‚Äî Shu Lin

Take off your long overcoat, run out of the stuffy house filled with turbid air, go to the countryside, and throw yourself into the embrace of spring!

Let us bathe in this bright spring light, washing away all the mildew that has grown up in the gloomy winter; let us also temporarily close the books with black words on white paper, and open another kind of living, wordless reading material.

See the hundreds of trees wearing new clothes, the weeping willows swaying in the breeze, the willow branches gently stroking the water surface; all over the mountains and fields are red flowers and green grass. What a beautiful picture this is! Those who practice calligraphy, why not bring your writing tools to describe it and ask it for advice?

Listen, the birds on the branches are playing the Spring Welcome Song. Who can say that there are no beautiful melodies in its song?

Don't close your eyes. We look at birds, beasts, and reptiles. What are their shapes and habits? How do they live? How do plants germinate, grow, and bud and bloom?

Pick up a piece of wood or a honeycomb and carefully observe its structure. You will discover many strange things, enough to make you write several pages of text.

Nature is the best school, and no other school has as many and as broad subjects as it does. We can get a lot of knowledge from this school that cannot be found in books.

Spring is the time of year when the school has the most knowledge. Even the least thoughtful person can get a lot of valuable knowledge and life inspiration in this vigorous spring, as long as he is willing to contact nature and open his eyes.

### Changing Surnames and Names

‚Äî Qing Lei Xue Tu

In the summer of 1945, Germany completely collapsed, and the entire territory came under the control of the Allied forces. Hitler's whereabouts were unknown. Some said he committed suicide and his body could not be identified, some said he fled to Argentina, and some said he fled to the East. The situation was confusing, and the Allied forces' search and arrest were naturally the right thing to do. Afterwards, it was reported in Europe that Hitler's brother submitted a request to the Allied authorities, stating that he would change his surname to "Hiler" to avoid harassment and avoid being implicated. This incident is laughable, but it is an interesting interlude in a thrilling martial arts drama.

"Hitler" (Â∏åÁâπÂãí) can be changed to "Hiler" (Â∏åÂãí) by simply removing the letter T, and the sound of the surname will be completely different. Unless he himself has committed any crimes, he will not suffer the hardship of being arrested instead of his brother. This kind of situation, if compared with Chinese examples, is slightly the same in the principle of changing names to avoid suspicion and staying away from disaster, but the method is different.

According to "Hitler," (Â∏åÁâπÂãí) it is the surname. His name is "Adolph," so although he is usually called Hitler, he must write his full name on formal documents (such as the declaration of war against the Soviet Union), Adolph Hitler. His brother's name is "Aloys Hitler" (ÈòøÈ≤ÅÂ£´Â∏åÁâπÂãí). Since they do not have the same name, there is no need to change the surname. If this Brother Hitler is also a war criminal, then he himself is qualified to be arrested and punished, so what is the use of changing the surname? Since he openly applied to change his surname, it means that the Allied forces did not consider him a war criminal, and he himself had no doubts or fears. It can be seen that his application to change his surname was completely affected by his brother.

In China, there are people who change their names to avoid suspicion, but it is rare to change their surnames, and there is no need to do so. For example, Wang Zhaoming, Wang Shijing, both have the surname "Wang," and both are "traitors." However, Shijing's arrest and conviction were not because of the surname "Wang," nor was he implicated by Zhaoming, but because of his own crimes. If Zhaoming's brothers had not been traitors, they would be innocent people, and their names would have no problem at all. But if another person also had the surname "Wang" and was also named "Zhaoming," then he would definitely be uneasy. Although Zhaoming does not have the mystery of life and death like Hitler, this "another Wang Zhaoming" would definitely "change his name" automatically to avoid stimulation, but he would never "change his surname." As for "Aloys Hitler's" changing his surname, it is indeed of great use to avoid implication. The reason lies in the fundamental difference in the principle of pronunciation of Chinese and Western people's names.

Hitler is usually only called Hitler, and his "Adolph" is rarely used. His brother is also usually only called "Hitler," and his "Aloys" is also something in the cold palace. Therefore, as long as there is a call to "Search for Hitler!" then this Brother Hitler can be "pulled and dragged to the court" (a line from the opera "Yu Tang Chun"). Rather than declaring "Aloys" after arriving at the court, it is better to remove a letter from "Hitler" as soon as possible and change it to "Hiler," which can save a lot of trouble. If a Chinese person is a traitor, unless he has the same name, those with the same surname can rest assured. Chinese people often call names and titles, not just the surname. Even if a group of classmates live together all day long, they must add words such as "Lao" (old) or "Xiao" (young) to the surname to make up two syllables in one breath. For example, "Lao Zhang, Lao Li, Xiao Wang, Xiao Wang" also need to add "Lao" and "Xiao" to the surname to make up two syllables in one breath. "Hitler" (Â∏åÁâπ) has two syllables in one word, so those with the same name are prone to suspicion. Therefore, it is customary to use the "surname" as a general term. The reason for using the surname as a general term is the same as the principle of calling the name in Chinese (limited by the acoustic law).

During the Chinese imperial era, it was customary to "respect and omit the last stroke" of the emperor's "given name" (Âæ°Âêç). For example, the "yi" (ÂÑÄ) in "Puyi" (Ê∫•ÂÑÄ) must omit the last stroke under "yi" (Áæ©). (Many books printed during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty still exist, and all of them are missing a stroke when encountering this.) For example, in Qianlong's "Hongli" (ÂºòÊõÜ), the dot at the end of "Hong" (Âºò) must be changed, and the "he" (Á¶æ) in "li" (Êö¶) must be changed to "mu" (Êú®), always using "iron pen" as the usual practice (rewriting is also common). The missing strokes in Chinese characters are only a difference in form and have nothing to do with the sound. Western characters are phonetic characters, so reducing the letters will greatly change the sound. However, it also depends on what kind of letters they are and what position they are in. For example, it is correct to change Hitler to Hiler by removing the "te" (Áâπ). Even if Himmler (Hmmler) removes one M, it is still "Himmler" (Â∏åÂßÜÂãí). You must remove two Ms to get another "Hiler" (Â∏åÂãí). (Himmler was Hitler's secret police chief and his most trusted confidant, the guy who was arrested after the war and committed suicide by swallowing poison.)

In the past, official documents in China often added strokes to the names of bandits and other criminals to avoid implicating good people. For example, when the Guangdong Governor during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty reported on the bandit "Luo Guo Zhang" (ÁæÖÂπóÁ´†), the "jin" (Â∑æ) radical of "Guo" (Âπó) was added by the official, because the name "Guo Zhang" (ÂúãÁ´†) was very common. If the criminal was not arrested, those with the same name would inevitably be implicated and blackmailed. Even if the criminal has been arrested and punished, those with the same name will inevitably feel unlucky and disgusted, and distant relatives and friends will be spared misunderstandings and suspicions. Therefore, adding strokes to make it a rare word can avoid this problem. For example, the "grass head" is added to the "yi" in "Zhu Yi Ren" (Êú±Ëã°‰ªÅ) in the Shandong sea ship robbery case, the "Zhou Chang L√º" (Âë®ËêáÁ∂†) in the Zhejiang criminal case, and the "Zhang Tong Wen" (ÂºµÊÅ´Êñá) in the Shaanxi robbery case. The cold words in the middle of their names can be seen at a glance as added strokes. The reduction of strokes in the "given name" is "respect and avoidance," while the addition of strokes in the bandit's name is to avoid implication.

In ancient China, there were occasionally cases of changing surnames to avoid disaster. For example, Zhang Hui of Changzhou. . Hanlin Zuo Wenlin Lang Yun Jun presented a memorial saying: "Yun's original surname was Yang, and Yun, the Marquis of Pingtong in the Han Dynasty, his son violated the disaster and took his father's name as his surname, which is called Zhen Dao, who was the Liang Xiang and later moved to Huangshan in Piling and was buried there. His descendants were Piling people for generations." According to Yang Yun in the Han Dynasty, whose name was Ziyou, he was tried for writing a letter to Sun Huizong with angry words. At that time, the penalties were barbaric, and "extermination of the clan" and "implication" were often used. His descendants did not dare to have the surname "Yang" and took his name as their surname. The Yun surname in Changzhou is still a large clan today, and there were many Hanlin members from the Yun family in the Qing Dynasty. Also, before the July 7th Incident, the older brother of Sheng Baotang, the chief writer of the Beiping Chenbao, talked about the origin of his surname. It was originally the descendant of General Nian Gengyao of the Qing Dynasty. General Nian was jealous of Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty. After being given suicide, his descendants were afraid, so they reduced the strokes of the word "Nian" (Âπ¥) to "Sheng" (Áîü). This is not exactly the same as the example of reducing the letters of "Hitler," but it is also enough to provide materials for mutual reference. Therefore, they are recorded together by category.

Mutual Assistance Among Classmates Averts Dropping Out of School

To the Gentlemen of the Social Services Department: On March 8th, I received your letter and learned that you could specially arrange for a grant to prevent me from dropping out of university, for which I am truly grateful! On February 29th, I went to a classmate's home and talked about the possibility of having to drop out this semester. My classmates were all in tears and didn't want to part with me. Later, classmate Xue Fuxing said, "We should all think of a way to help classmate Lu." On March 1st, five classmates came to my home and surprisingly decided on a kind of "charity association" method, raising exactly two million yuan. The participating classmates are Xue Fuxing, Kang Xiumei, Xu Jingen, Sun Qigang, and Chen Yongxing. In addition, my father borrowed 500,000 yuan from the neighbors, and I managed to scrape together 300,000 yuan myself, so my studies have been secured. I won't need to apply for a grant this semester. Thank you to the gentlemen of your newspaper. As for my father's rheumatism, firstly, the weather has warmed up, and his condition is somewhat better; secondly, Shanghai County is currently dredging the river, and the township, bao, jia, and chiefs are all extremely busy. To apply for relief, it would be somewhat difficult at the moment to find them to affix their seals of approval. I am very grateful for the newspaper's kindness. I will work twice as hard in all subjects, as instructed in your letter. I respectfully wish you all the best. Student, Lu Binxiang, respectfully submitted.

### Seeking Chinese Friends

Editor Sir: Thanks to the introduction in your newspaper's "Social Services" column, a friend of mine received seventeen letters from China in two months, in other words, he gained seventeen Chinese friends.

Like my friend, I have always loved and admired China, with its beautiful scenery, ancient culture, and beloved people.

I also hope to use a corner of your newspaper to seek a few Chinese friends and correspond with them regularly. I am twenty-nine years old, an Australian soldier currently serving in northern New Guinea. I love literature, music, gardening, painting, and stamp collecting. My mailing address is Crow's Nest, Queensland, Australia. Respectfully, H. W. Miller.

### Postal Q&A

Our Bureau has received inquiries from (1) Mr. Zong of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, (2) Mr. Jiang Hanbing of Zhongzheng South Road, (3) The New Youth Society of Shanghai, and (4) Mr. Sun Zuoting of Cai Tongde Pharmacy. We hereby provide brief answers to the various points raised:

(Answers) (1) (A) Remittances are not available to Zhouwangmiao Town. Remittances can be sent to the nearby Chang'an or Xieqiao post offices. (B) If parcels contain American goods, an import permit must be prepared for customs inspection; otherwise, import duties must be paid.

(2) Surface mail from Shanghai to Java is either shipped directly to Surabaya for transfer or carried to Singapore or Hong Kong for transit. Currently, there is no fixed shipping schedule. These items are dispatched once or twice a week, taking approximately three weeks to arrive.

(3) If mail that should be posted in a specific delivery zone is directly submitted to the sub-bureau of that delivery zone, it can be delivered directly by the sub-bureau without being transferred by the Management Bureau.

(4) (A) Local mail in Shanghai can be delivered on the same day if it is submitted to a designated sub-bureau or dropped into a rush-hour mailbox. The North Station Sub-bureau is a designated sub-bureau, and there are three rush-hour mailboxes on North Henan Road. (B) Mailboxes installed at agency offices and consignment points are not rush-hour mailboxes. (C) For mail sent to post office boxes, it is only necessary to indicate the box number, and there is no need to indicate the district number. (D) Each sub-bureau delivers mail four times a day, and three times on Sundays. (E) The opening time of the mailbox is the same as the post office's collection time. (F) Regarding publications on postal knowledge, there is the Modern Postal Monthly, published by the Modern Postal Monthly Society of the Postal General Administration. Chinese Cultural Service Societies and major bookstores throughout the country sell it for 10,000 yuan per copy, 50,000 yuan for six issues every six months. Post offices throughout the country also sell it and can arrange subscriptions.
