[Our Correspondent in Guling, 16th] President Chiang hosted a luncheon banquet at his official residence in Guling on the 16th for important officials who came to Guling. Among those who attended were Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Acting Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Committee Long Yun, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee Chen Bulei, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chairman of Jiangxi Province Hu Jiafeng, and Chairman of the National Socialist Party Zhang Junmai.

[Our Correspondent in Guling, 16th] The President and his wife invited Chinese and foreign dignitaries in Guling to a picnic at Tianchi Temple on the evening of the 16th. Among those who participated were Ambassador Stuart, Advisor Brewster, General and Mrs. Berge, President Sun Ke, Vice Minister Zheng Jiemin, Military Attache Chen Shulin, Secretary You Jianwen, and Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party Zhang Junmai, totaling more than ten people. The group set off separately at around 6 p.m. After arriving at Dalin Road, they abandoned their vehicles and walked. At 7:15 p.m., they arrived at the Buddha's Hand Rock. The First Lady, along with the Ambassador and the Berge couple, went ahead, while the President, Sun Ke, and others followed behind. The First Lady and her group went from Buddha's Hand Rock to Fairy Cave. After the President arrived, he decided not to visit further due to the late hour. Instead, they boarded their vehicles and went directly to Tianchi Temple, arriving at 5:30 p.m. Zhang Junmai had already arrived and was waiting. At that time, mist rose from the mountains, enveloping the entire mountain. After about ten minutes, it cleared, and the setting sun shone obliquely, with colorful clouds covering the sky. Looking north from Tianchi Temple, the mountains, rivers, plains, and fields stretched as far as the eye could see. Clouds floated in the air, creating a spectacular view. The President, his wife, and the Chinese and foreign dignitaries gazed at the scene for a long time before starting their picnic. They chatted and laughed during the meal, and it was not until 8:30 p.m. that they returned in high spirits. Ambassador Stuart, Advisor Brewster, General and Mrs. Berge are scheduled to descend the mountain at 8 a.m. on the 17th and go to Shili Shop, where they will take a special plane back to Nanjing.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 16th] The President and his wife are still very interested in sightseeing. On the evening of the 16th, they invited Ambassador Stuart, the Berge couple, and others to visit Tianchi Temple and have a picnic. Tianchi Temple was built during the Jiading period of the Song Dynasty. It suffered from the disasters of war during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, so it remains dilapidated and desolate to this day. The temple has Tianchi Spring, whose water flows continuously. To the west of Tianchi Temple is Wenshu Terrace, which can be climbed to look down, with distant waves flickering, green shadows, and red clouds, making for extremely beautiful scenery. When the President and his party arrived, the temple monk Shi Dazheng came out to greet them. The President earnestly inquired about repairing the temple buildings, showing great concern.

Li replied that he would fly to Nanjing on the 17th and already had a special plane, so there was no need to send another one. After arriving in Nanjing, Li will transfer to Guling.

### "Facing the Soviet Union": Report by the U.S. Foreign Policy Association Says U.S. Does Not Want to Aid China with Military Supplies

[United Press, Washington, 15th] A report by the Foreign Policy Association states: "The United States is not very willing to aid the Chinese government with a large amount of military supplies" because it fears that "the Soviet Union will supply the Chinese Communists with the same or even more military supplies." The report is titled "Facing the Soviet Union" and was written by Columbia University professor of international relations and advisor to the U.S. delegation at the Potsdam Conference, Mr. Marsh Lai. He said: "In China, both the United States and the Soviet Union are carefully avoiding direct confrontation. No matter how strong the Soviet Union is, the risks and costs for Europe are greater than for the Soviet Union." The report states that the Soviet Union had demanded that Japan be forced to surrender to the American and Soviet allied forces, but was rejected by the United States. Later, it also requested that the United States and the Soviet Union jointly administer Japan, but was also rejected by the United States.

A Piece of Diplomatic History

Mr. Marsh's report states that after the Soviet Union's two requests were rejected, Molotov obstructed the work of concluding treaties with Germany's satellite countries at the London Foreign Ministers Conference in 1946, causing it to come to a halt. Later, Molotov proposed discussing the Japanese issue, which was accepted. Mr. Marsh pointed out that three months after the Second London Conference, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to establish the Far Eastern Commission and the Tokyo Far East Tribunal to determine the policy of occupying Japan. Mr. Marsh added that at the Potsdam Conference in 1945, Stalin said that the Soviet Union could not allow free elections in Eastern European countries after the war, because this would produce "anti-Soviet" policies.

Summarizing the Soviet Union's various activities in the Far East, Mr. Marsh said: The United States believes that "a friendly Japan is a necessary condition for the United States' security in the Pacific." However, from the Soviet Union's perspective, it is suspicious of this new expansion of the United States. Mr. Marsh said: The Soviet Union "firmly refused" to conclude a treaty with Japan according to the conditions proposed by the United States. The draft proposed by the United States did not include a veto. He also said: "However, in the future, the United States may make peace with Japan alone, and the Soviet Union and Japan will still be at war." Mr. Marsh did not speculate further on this.

Referring to the Korean issue, Mr. Marsh said: The Soviet Union has so far shown no intention of loosening its control over the north. He said: "This is their policy, hoping that due to indefinite delays, they can stay longer than the American occupation forces."

The Soviet Union May Compromise

Although Mr. Marsh believes that there is currently no basis for coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union on disputes, he said that it would be a huge mistake to think that "all negotiations will be fruitless" because of this. He said: "Some problems cannot be solved or improved until the situation of power and politics is clear." Mr. Marsh said: The Soviet Union may temporarily show compromise, and "the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union will disappear." He also said: From 1917 to 1921, Soviet leaders believed that war and failure had created "an opportunity for a Communist revolution, especially in France." This revolutionary climax allowed capitalism to achieve temporary stability in the 1920s. However, "Soviet communist doctrine continued to predict a 'second war and revolution.'"

Mr. Marsh said: Since 1946, the Soviet Union has indeed gained "the greatest advantage" in this "second" war. But now it can be considered to have passed, and another "balance" period has begun. If they are going to take any action, it will be to adopt a more compromising attitude towards the United States.

### Far Eastern Commission Passes New Bill: All Japanese Loot Must Be Returned; Stipulates Application Must Be Made Quickly Within Eight Months; Eleven-Nation Representatives Form Committee to Advise Allied Headquarters

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] Diplomatic circles: Regarding the return of materials looted by Japan from the occupied areas of various Allied countries during the war, the Far Eastern Commission passed a new resolution at the end of July this year. The discussion of this new case took a long time, starting as early as June 1936 and only recently being completed. The new resolution has many improvements compared to the old case passed by the Commission in July 1935. The important ones are as follows: (1) All looted goods, regardless of their type or whether they were produced before or after the occupation, must be returned once they are verified. (2) Japanese ships transporting Japanese materials to the receiving countries of the looted goods, if there is spare tonnage when leaving Japan, should conveniently carry the looted goods to that country for return. (3) The cost of salvaging and repairing sunken ships looted within Japanese territorial waters should be entirely borne by the Japanese government and should not be deducted from the compensation account of the receiving country. The costs of the crew driving the looted ships to the original owner's country for return, unless the receiving country is willing, may not be borne. (4) For looted goods that cannot prove their original owner (including gold, silver, and jewelry, but excluding cultural relics), Allied Headquarters should first give representatives of various countries ample opportunity for inspection and identification, so that they can be recognized as much as possible, and then Allied Headquarters should sell them and use the proceeds as a guarantee fund. Allied Headquarters is responsible for managing the fund. During the management period, Allied Headquarters may consider using the fund as a loan guarantee for purposes related to the occupation, but its original value should be preserved by Allied Headquarters and its subordinate institutions. On October 1, 1938, the proceeds from this sale will be distributed to the seven countries that were occupied by Japan - China, the United States, Australia, France, India, New Zealand, and the Philippines - according to the general compensation ratio. These seven countries will have the right of first refusal when selling these looted goods. (5) When there are doubts about the documents submitted by applicants for the return of looted goods, judgment should be made based on legal fairness and common sense to decide whether to return them. (6) Representatives from each of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission will form a committee in Japan to return looted goods. If there are doubts about the documents submitted for the return of looted goods, and it is uncertain whether the looted goods should be returned or sold as materials for which the original owner cannot be proven, Allied Headquarters should consult the opinions of the committee. Regarding matters related to the return of looted goods, if the opinion of Allied Headquarters differs from that of the majority of the committee representatives, Allied Headquarters should report the committee's opinion to the United States government. (7) Looted goods that have not been applied for in advance, and have therefore been designated as compensation materials, must have already been delivered to the receiving country of the compensation materials before an application for return can be made. (8) Within eight months from the date of the passage of this new resolution, which is transferred to Allied Headquarters by the U.S. government for implementation, countries should quickly apply for the return of looted goods. Applications for return will not be accepted after the deadline without special permission from Allied Headquarters.

(2) The Organizational Regulations of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs are hereby abolished. This is the order.

Editorial

### The Problem of Freezing US Aid Funds

If the funds obtained from the sale of US aid materials are used to cover the deficit in public finances, after paying for various necessary expenses as agreed, some estimate that it can avoid the printing of more than 400 trillion new banknotes. Others estimate that, based on our country's previous issuance amount, this fund can at least offset 50% of the currency issued. In reality, the exchange rate of the legal tender against the US dollar is declining daily, so it is currently difficult to accurately estimate how much this fund will be when converted into legal tender. What is known is that if this fund can be definitively agreed upon for the purpose of covering the fiscal deficit, it will have a decisive effect on balancing the national budget and reducing the issuance of new banknotes, thereby alleviating inflation and achieving the common goal of stabilizing the economy, at least partially.

However, the US seems to emphasize the path of reproduction, that is, to use most of these funds for various production aspects. This is a very proper approach in normal times, because covering government expenses is too passive and cannot directly achieve the purpose of economic development. The reason why various foreign debts have been criticized and why the country's foreign debt has been increasing is due to this problem. The US learns from past mistakes and focuses on reproduction. Although there may be a role in doing more business, in general, developing production undertakings is always beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Moreover, to maintain the national spirit and develop national strength, it is necessary to take this path. However, in this autumn of communist bandits disturbing and flames of war spreading everywhere, it is impossible to talk about economic construction without quickly suppressing the chaos and stabilizing order. Therefore, in a time of malignant inflation and economic turmoil, it is impossible to talk about increasing production without quickly balancing income and expenditure and stabilizing the currency value. Don't we see that the existing industries are still in a precarious situation? Are foreign merchants' businesses in China not facing the same difficulties? Therefore, in principle, we should agree with the US proposal, but we cannot but hope that they will give China another serious consideration on the order of urgency and importance.

As for the so-called freezing of special accounts, its content is not yet clear. According to common sense, once any funds are frozen, they are not allowed to be used during the specified period. Its role is to restrict the owner's immediate use, thereby reducing the number of chips on the market, which will help tighten floating capital and ease inflation. However, the effect of the freeze only extends to the owner of the deposit and not to the bank where it is deposited. Because the bank's responsibility is limited to paying on maturity, without bearing any trust, it does not have the obligation to keep these frozen funds in the vault in full, nor does it have the necessity to reserve sufficient cash of equal value for a long time. Therefore, these funds, although frozen on the depositor's side, can still be used by the bank, and are not actually frozen. In other words, these funds can still be circulated by the bank in the market, and are still a huge amount of floating capital. The so-called recall of legal tender is just empty talk, and has no actual impact. On the contrary, because there is a frozen deposit that is not used for a long time, the bank does not need to increase a huge number of chips that do not need to be paid immediately, and can legally use it to increase its lending capacity and capital for hoarding goods. If this is the case, wouldn't it run counter to the purpose of contracting the currency and suppressing prices? If, after these funds are frozen, the bank must also freeze them in full and is not allowed to use them freely, then the banks will not want to compete for this frozen deposit. It is reasonable to assume that they would not leave their warehouses empty and unwilling to use them, and would rather store this huge amount of banknotes for others!

Some people think that the so-called freezing naturally refers to depositing it in the national treasury, which is equivalent to covering the deficit. We hope that this statement is not empty. Because only by doing so can it help the government balance its finances and reduce issuance; and only by doing so can it alleviate inflation and stabilize the economy. However, instead of using the phrase "transfer to the national treasury," the word "freeze" is used, which does not seem to correspond to the reality. It is hoped that when formally agreed upon, clearer wording will be used to dispel doubts and avoid smuggling under the cover of the word "freeze"!

### Zhejiang Financial and Grain Conference Opens; Dividing into Financial and Tax, and Farmland and Grain Groups, Emphasis on Lectures Rather Than Review; Chen Yi Explains in Detail the Establishment of the Materials Committee

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 16th] The Zhejiang Provincial Financial and Grain Conference opened in Hangzhou on the 16th, with 192 people attending. The main purpose of the conference is to cooperate with the needs of suppressing chaos and building the country, emphasizing lectures rather than review, and dividing into financial and tax, and farmland and grain groups. Chairman Chen Yi delivered a speech, proposing three principles: facilitate the people, cherish public property, and earnestly engage in politics, in order to complete the task of rectifying finance and grain. Speaker Zhang Qiang of the Provincial参议会 hoped to take from the people and use for the people, abolish corruption, and strengthen publicity. The conference is scheduled to close on the 22nd.

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 16th] Chairman Chen Yi recently explained the Zhejiang Provincial Materials Operation Committee, saying that it is purely to use public capital to manage public enterprises for the happiness of all the people; it is not to use private capital to manage monopolistic enterprises and only seek the benefit of a few people. If government officials use their private capital to run monopolistic enterprises, it is bureaucratic capital, which should not be allowed to exist. Instead, they will create national capital belonging to all the people by running public enterprises. Chen claimed to have firm confidence that the profits obtained in the future will definitely be used to improve the welfare of the people of the province, make their lives more stable and secure, and become more prosperous.

The details of the methods are as follows: A.

### Yellow River Water Recedes; Autumn Floods Can Be Passed Safely

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 16th] The Yellow River water level at Luokou reached its highest point at 29.93 meters on the night of the 15th. However, by 9:00 a.m. on the 16th, it had receded to 29.81 meters. According to Secretary-General Chen Yungong of the Shandong River Repair and Defense Office, the water level at Shanzhou in the upper reaches of the Yellow River rose again by about half a meter on the 15th, and it is expected that the water head will reach Luokou in four days. However, there is a local saying: "The 15th of the seventh month determines the flood." Therefore, this year's autumn flood can be safely passed, and there is absolutely nothing to worry about.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] The water level at Luokou continues to rise, and the river defense is in urgent condition. The water level has reached 29.86 meters, and a dangerous situation has arisen.

### Malayan Communist Uprising: Overseas Chinese Suffer; Our Telegram to Consul General in Singapore; Negotiating to Protect Overseas Chinese

And Assisting the British in Suppressing the Communists

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Diplomatic circles news: Since the Communist Party uprising in Malaya, a large number of local residents have been brutally killed, and no fewer than 40 of our overseas Chinese compatriots have also been killed. Our government believes that this area is a concentration of our overseas Chinese, so after learning of the incident, it repeatedly telegraphed the Consulate General in Singapore and the consulates in Malaya to immediately negotiate with the local government on all necessary measures to protect overseas Chinese, and to investigate the details of the loss of life and property suffered by the overseas Chinese. Moreover, since the British authorities have already begun to suppress the communists in Malaya, in order to jointly maintain local security and protect the rights and interests of overseas Chinese, our government has ordered the relevant consulates to mobilize the local overseas Chinese to assist the British as much as possible in their anti-communist measures, so that order can be restored as soon as possible.

### Hong Kong Assembly Ordinance; Strictly Enforced From Now On

This assembly ordinance will be strictly enforced in the future, and will be extended to assemblies in schools. Another measure to strengthen the defense here is to double the number of night patrol police.

### Searching for Peking Man; We Request Allied Headquarters Assistance

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Our delegation in Japan has requested Allied Headquarters to assist in finding Peking Man, who was taken away by the Japanese in 1941. The head of the Compensation and Restitution Group of our delegation in Japan, Yu Bannong, stated that Peking Man is considered to be a human skull as ancient as Heidelberg Man and Java Man. It was excavated in 1926 in Zhoukoudian, south of Beiping, and preserved in the Peking Union Medical College. In 1941, the authorities of the Peking Union Medical College, with the permission of our government due to the deteriorating situation in China, decided to send Peking Man to the United States for preservation. It was packed into three large boxes and handed over to the US Marines who were evacuating North China on the American President Harrison ship. Unfortunately, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on the same day. The Marines were all captured, and Peking Man mysteriously disappeared. For a long time, Peking Man was forgotten. In 1942, Hikosaburo Hasebe, professor of archeology at Tokyo Imperial University, traveled to Beiping to visit the warehouse of the Peking Union Medical College, only to discover that Peking Man was not inside. The following spring, the Japanese military police conducted an investigation into this case for more than a month, and it was rumored that Peking Man had been discovered in Tianjin. However, it was soon rumored that what was discovered was not Peking Man but deer teeth, and nothing was heard after that. It was not until the end of the war that Dr. Li Qing was sent to search, but with no results. From the various events that have occurred, in order to discover the missing Peking Man, it seems necessary to find the US Marines who accepted the three boxes of Peking Man, the Japanese troops who captured the Marines, and the Japanese troops who occupied the Peking Union Medical College, but this kind of work will require a lot of money and manpower.

### Rebuilding Rural China (Part 2)

A Conversation with Mr. James Yen

Promoting Self-Defense and Self-Governance Through Organizational Education: The target of organizational education is also the farmers. The aim is twofold: to strengthen rural armed self-defense to protect their hometowns, and to enhance farmers' self-governance as a foundation for exercising political power and implementing constitutional government. The Mass Education Movement had promoted "civic education" in Ding County for many years and had established basic moral standards: (1) great virtue and selflessness, (2) courage and fearlessness, (3) universal love and impartiality, (4) sincerity and genuineness, wisdom and discernment, and many other standards for oneself, others, and the public. When discussing organizational education, Mr. Yen pointed out that in today's era of implementing constitutional government and discussing rural construction and revitalization, organizational education is also about rural self-defense and self-governance, and is closely related to the three aspects of education: literacy, production, and health. Mr. Yen said, "Eloquent articles in newspapers and solemn legislative provisions cannot implement constitutional government. How can we talk about self-defense when people cannot even write their names, are not well-fed, and are weak and dying?" The interdependence of literacy, medicine, production, health, and organization: Mr. Yen further explained that life is an organic whole, and being biased towards any one aspect is unhealthy. Solely focusing on saving the country through agriculture or youth education will not achieve anything in isolation. Mr. Yen elaborated on the interconnected and mutually supportive nature of the four, saying: "Only by being literate can one receive education; only when agriculture and forestry flourish will the people have surplus resources and the mental and physical energy to discuss other things; health can only improve with knowledge and abundance; and only after improvement will there be conditions for engaging in production, education, and organization. And organizational education is the only necessary stage to assist the common people in managing their own affairs." Mr. Yen continued to explain the enlightening role of education itself in rural construction: "Only when people are educated can they automatically and spontaneously improve themselves." However, although the four are interconnected, when implementing them in rural areas, it is permissible to adapt to local conditions and decide which to start with first. In areas where production has declined, one can start with production education; in areas where the people's intelligence is backward, one can start with literacy education. Once started, the four should advance together; the countryside is a whole, and improving rural life should not be piecemeal.

Research and Experimentation and Promotion, in the past, such as the Ding County experimental work of the Mass Education Movement, were all research and experimentation by private academic institutions. Now, the establishment of the Joint Committee for Rural Reconstruction is a promotion from the government's perspective. The Mass Education Movement was initiated in 1923 and experimented in Ding County, Hebei, in 1930, followed by the establishment of institutions in Hengshan and Xindu, Sichuan, to engage in experimentation. The selection of these three locations was aimed at their representativeness in their respective regions, representing the vast areas of North China, Central China, and Southwest China, respectively. Mr. Yen specifically mentioned that during the same period, the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping, Shandong, headed by Mr. Liang Shuming and Mr. Liang Zhonghua, the Jiangsu Education College in Wuxi, Jiangsu, headed by Yu Jian, the Xiaozhuang School in Nanjing and the Baoshan Labor Academy in Shanghai, led by Mr. Tao Xingzhi, as well as educational institutions such as Yenching University, Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University, University of Nanking, West China University, and Nankai University, all made significant contributions to the experimental work of rural construction. Mr. Yen said: "For decades, those engaged in the rural movement have delved into the people, studying methods and systems for cultivating people's power, which is the opposite of scholars locking themselves in rooms to study Western books. It can be said to be a revolutionary trend." Mr. Yen believes that the rural construction movement in China over the past few decades has conducted research and experimentation using scientific methods. Various provinces also had considerable promotion work before and during the war, referring to the Mass Education Movement having engaged in large-scale promotion work with the provincial governments of Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi, respectively. As for the national effort with huge financial resources, bringing together Chinese and American experts, and promoted by the government with political power, it has been since today.

Host's Comments: Mr. Yen expressed his gratification at the establishment of the Joint Committee for Rural Reconstruction and has confidence in its future achievements. He said: "This time, the US aid specifically designated funds for improving the welfare of Chinese farmers and alleviating their suffering, which shows the American people's respect and sympathy for the Chinese people. Based on their experience of fighting together in the Anti-Japanese War, they believe that the Chinese people possess immense power, but they have not had the opportunity to develop it. Now, the work of rural construction should aim to cultivate and unleash their power." Mr. Yen has been engaged in the rural construction movement in China for 30 years, and his achievements are remarkable, and he has long been admired by academic circles at home and abroad. His research insights and practical experience in rural construction cannot be fully understood in a brief evening conversation. Mr. Yen's acceptance of the government's important task clearly demonstrates his great confidence in rebuilding the disaster-stricken rural areas of China. The following is the conclusion based on Mr. Yen's own words:

"China has had nearly 30 years of rural programs seeking to increase the welfare of farmers and alleviate their suffering. This time, US aid will assist us in promoting the rural construction movement. In short, foreign aid is nothing more than assisting us in fully developing 'self-reliance.' We can only achieve 'regeneration' with 'self-reliance.' Everything depends on our own efforts and the cooperation of all sectors of society." (The End)

### Three Envoys Meet Soviet Foreign Minister Again; No Agreement Reached on Resolving Berlin Crisis; Soviets Insist on Terminating West German Government Plan

[Special Dispatch] Moscow, 16th - Radio Moscow: The envoys of Britain, the United States, and France met again with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 16th to resolve the Berlin crisis and other German issues. The meeting was held at the Kremlin at 6 p.m. and lasted approximately one hour. After the meeting, the envoys of the three countries, representing their respective governments, conferred at the British Embassy on the results of the meeting. To date, Western powers' diplomats have held more than twelve hours of talks with Molotov and other Soviet officials, including one meeting with Stalin. According to British Ambassador Smith, no conclusion has been reached in the talks so far.

[Special Dispatch] London, 16th - Radio Berlin: Despite the Soviet Union's opposition to the West German government plan, Western military leaders are actively pursuing the plan. US Commander in Germany Clay and the British and French Commanders in Germany are scheduled to meet with German leaders on the 16th to draft a provisional constitution for West Germany. Western countries also plan to hold a conference in September to formulate detailed plans for the joint management of the Ruhr area. Regarding the secret meetings in Moscow, it is reported that the Soviet Union specifically demands the termination of the West German government plan, which may be the biggest obstacle to reaching an agreement.

[United Press, London, 16th] The Kremlin talks have been lengthy, and there has been no official statement to date. It was generally believed that the negotiations could lead to a four-power foreign ministers' conference, but now this hope is becoming increasingly slim. Western countries continue to promote the plan to establish a West German government, and the Soviet Union's opposition to the plan is a well-known fact. The three Western commanders-in-chief in Germany are scheduled to meet with German political leaders in Frankfurt on the 16th to discuss the West German plan. The six Western countries that signed the London West German Agreement will also meet next month to discuss the details of the joint management of the Ruhr area. According to the plan, German representatives will meet in September to produce a provisional constitution for West Germany. Western European diplomatic circles are hoping that the disputes between the US and the Soviet Union will not dispel the last ray of hope for an East-West agreement. They believe that the disputes should not affect the negotiations, but they are still filled with anxieties. British newspapers reflect public opinion's extreme concern about East-West relations, fearing that the appeasement policies of the past will be repeated today.

### Rumor Says Vyshinsky Personally Went to Berlin to Order the German Communist Party to Carry Out Purges in Order to Emulate the People's Revolution Launched in Czechoslovakia and Hungary

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] The "Black Echo" of the Free Democratic Party reported on the 16th that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had recently personally inspected Berlin, and immediately ordered the German Communist Party to be purged and reorganized into "combat cadres." The report said that since Vyshinsky's visit to Berlin, the Kremlin had bypassed Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky and directly issued orders to lower levels, and Moscow directly monitored and directed the Soviet Union's policy in Germany. The new head of the Soviet Union in Germany is Rokossovsky, who arrived here two months ago. Western intelligence sources said that Rokossovsky is currently the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Western Army, overseeing Germany and Austria, with headquarters in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. Intelligence officials also said that Rokossovsky may now be personally directing a war game that began a month ago in Germany, but no Western observers have been able to confirm that Vyshinsky had been to Germany. "Monday Echo" also said that the two men, Rokossovsky and Vyshinsky, had held several meetings with German Communist Party leaders Pieck and Diekmann. The former ordered party members to undergo strict purges, only allowing "extremely active and loyal" communists to remain in the party. The purges should be extended to the economic committees, industries, and police in the Soviet-occupied zone. It also said that Vyshinsky ordered the Communist Party to no longer cooperate with non-Communist parties in East Germany, so it is predicted that the Free Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Party will soon be banned in the Soviet zone. Western observers believe that this is clearly a Soviet plan, and said that the Soviet Union is prepared to emulate Hungary and Czechoslovakia, ordering East Germany to launch a "people's revolution."

### Currency War Intensifies in East and West Berlin

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] Western authorities admit that they are very concerned about the influx of West German marks into Soviet hands. This phenomenon has continued since the Soviet Union froze East German mark accounts. It is generally speculated that the Soviet Union may be accumulating West German marks, either to fund Communist activities in West Germany, or to dump them in the West German-occupied zone in the future, causing new inflation. Since the West German currency reform on June 23, the total value of West German marks circulating in Berlin is approximately 400 million. Germans in West Berlin are requesting an increase in the amount in circulation to alleviate the financial distress caused by the Soviet blockade of currency, and Western authorities agree with this view. However, Frankfurt bank officials doubt whether it is appropriate to increase the circulation of West German marks in West Berlin under the current circumstances. The three anti-Communist political parties in Berlin submitted a memorandum to the Western authorities last weekend, requesting that the West German mark be recognized as the only legal currency in West Berlin. The Communist Party has seized on this request again. The Soviet military newspaper demanded that the current Berlin city council be overthrown and replaced by a Communist group. The article stated: "The anti-Communist group's request to recognize the West German mark as legal currency is an attempt to obstruct any East-West agreement in the Moscow talks."

### US Air Force Chief of Staff Arrives in Turkey to Inspect Turkish Air Force Equipment

[United Press, Ankara, 16th] US Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg and Air Force Secretary Symington arrived in Ankara at noon on the 16th and will inspect Turkish Air Force equipment. They will meet with Turkish President Inonu on the afternoon of the 16th. They were transported by 18 American-aided aircraft piloted by Turkish Air Force personnel.

### Scarlet Fever Epidemic in Switzerland, More Than a Thousand Deaths

[Special Dispatch] London, 16th - Radio: A scarlet fever epidemic is sweeping through Basel, Switzerland. The two children's hospitals are full, and the authorities have set up temporary hospitals near schools. The city-wide death rate has reached over a thousand, and schools have been closed since the 16th.

### Britain, America and France Refuse to Participate in the Drafting of the New Danube River Treaty; Italy, Greece and Belgium Notify They Will Not Abandon Navigation Rights

[Special Dispatch] London, 16th - Radio Belgrade: Italy, Greece, and Belgium have formally notified the Danube River Conference of their determination to protect their navigation rights on the Danube River. The three countries declared in their notification that they were determined to retain their rights as participants in the 1921 convention, including navigation rights on the Danube River. The conference studied the details of the new convention on the morning of the 16th, in order to replace the 1921 convention.

[United Press, Belgrade, 16th] The representatives of Britain, the United States, and France attending the Danube River Conference announced on the 16th that they would not participate in the drafting committee to draft the new Danube River Convention. US Ambassador Cannon said that the work of the drafting committee was only to arrange three or four amendments in order. Since English is no longer an official language, it is unwise to participate at this time. Soviet representative Vyshinsky moved to invite the British representative to participate in the drafting, but was rejected by the British representative, Chairman Baker. Vyshinsky said that if the United States is unwilling to participate in the work of the conference, "we will continue anyway" and believe that the attitude of the non-participating countries is not considerate. Baker finally announced the establishment of the drafting committee, composed of the five countries of the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. Britain believes that the Soviet Union's amendment to Article 41 of the convention is inappropriate, giving countries involved in disputes the right to comment on their actions, and has proposed another amendment, which the United States fully supports.

### The Four Countries Continue to Discuss the Issue of Italian Territories at the London Conference; Libya Becomes the Focus of the Dispute Between the Two Sides

[United Press, London, 16th] According to confirmed information here: the secret discussions on the issue of Italian territories at the four-power deputy foreign ministers' meeting will reach a decisive stage this week. It is widely believed that the "easier" issues of Somalia and Istria have been discussed and completed. The four deputy foreign ministers will shift their attention to the most difficult issue, Libya. It is generally expected that the Soviet Union and the Western allies will have extremely fierce conflicts on this issue.

Since the Soviet Union clearly stated its opposition to British trusteeship of Cyrenaica and French trusteeship of Fezzan in the Four-Power Consultation Committee, Britain and France may stand on the same front on the Libya issue.

### Siam Brewing New Coup d'état; National Military and Police Ordered to Be on High Alert

[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 16th] Siamese Prime Minister Pibul's serious-natured broadcast speech on the 15th has further increased the serious atmosphere of the tense political situation in the past two weeks. The speech was a warning to the so-called troublemakers. Luang Pibul said that the Siamese government has now taken measures sufficient to cope with any incident and will use all its strength to maintain order. It is widely believed that this statement is a sign that the Siamese government will implement national martial law in the event of an emergency. The Siamese military and police have been ordered to be on high alert in the next few days. Siam was still calm on the surface a month ago, but Luang Pibul's speech has surprised most people. Observers believe that if any danger occurs in Siam, it must come from Siam's small number of factions. However, foreign observers have yet to learn which party will hold a new coup. Naturally, the Siamese government considers the current situation to be extremely serious and is also concerned about the events that may occur in the next few weeks.

### Japanese Socialist Democratic Party Advocates Quickly Opening a Peace Conference with Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to sources from the Socialist Democratic Party, the party plans to submit an urgent motion at the upcoming temporary session of the parliament, requesting that the peace conference with Japan be held as soon as possible. The reason is that the unnecessary delay in Japan's independence and autonomy will encourage the tendency of the Japanese to rely on foreign aid and make Japan's recovery more difficult. The Socialist Democratic Party will also demand that the disposal of reparations goods guarantee the minimum survival rights of the Japanese people. At the same time, in order to consider Japan's security, it will be designated as a permanently neutral country or a collective security country of the United Nations. Socialist Democratic Party sources believe that unless a peace treaty is signed, Japan will have various difficulties and will not be able to implement the entire recovery plan. Some internal problems are related to international relations and cannot be resolved before Japan re-enters the community of nations.

### Public Utilities Firmly Refuse to Lower Prices; Mayor Proposes Four Suggestions and Urges Consideration Before Reporting to the Government Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Municipal Council's Provisional General Assembly resolved to reduce the prices of public utilities for this month, Mayor Wu summoned representatives of the respective companies to the Municipal Government for discussions at 3:00 PM yesterday. The companies resolutely refused to lower prices, maintaining a firm stance. In addition to representatives from American-owned Electric Power, American-owned Telephone, British-owned Water, British-owned Gas, British-owned Tram, French-owned Water and Electricity, and Chinese-owned Zhabei and Pudong companies, those invited to attend the discussions yesterday included Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, Deputy Speaker Xu, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan, Convener of the Public Utilities Sub-committee Li Wenjie, Jiang Hao, and Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue, totaling over thirty people. The meeting lasted for four hours.

Representatives from the various public utility companies spoke in turn, stating the insufficient income of their respective companies and expressing hope that there would be no further reductions. They even stated that if citizens refused to pay or delayed paying the new prices, leading to a decrease in company revenue, they would be forced to stop water and electricity supply, and the responsibility should lie with the organ that decided to reduce prices. He Qing, the General Manager of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, advocated for government subsidies instead of loans. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Councilor Jiang Hao, Councilor Li Wenjie, and Director Zhao Zengjue repeatedly urged them, but no concrete results were achieved. Speaker Pan detailed the painstaking efforts of the Municipal Council in this matter, starting with five hours of serious discussion at the Provisional General Assembly, which resulted in this compromise on price reductions. If the companies persisted in their own views, refused to accept it, and even relied on their privileged monopoly to threaten to stop water and electricity supply, it would affect social security, and the responsibility should be borne by the respective companies. This is something that the Mayor and the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau should pay special attention to. Mayor Wu finally put forward four suggestions: (1) Each company should accept the Municipal Council's price reductions for August; (2) The actual amount of insufficient revenue in August should be applied to the Central Bank for loans by the Municipal Government in conjunction with the Municipal Council; (3) The method of repaying the principal and interest on the loan should be discussed to appropriately extend the installments in order to reduce the burden; (4) A public investigation and deliberation committee for public utilities should be organized as soon as possible, and a meeting should be held this Wednesday to impartially review the actual income and expenditure of each company and re-establish the pricing standards starting from September. The Mayor also hoped that representatives of each company would go back and consider, and report the results to the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM today (Monday) in the hope of a satisfactory solution.

### Speaker Pan Tells Reporters After Meeting That If They Threaten by Stopping Supply, the Government Has the Right to Take Over

Speaker Pan Gongzhan told reporters after the meeting: (1) This time, the price increase of public utilities was too great, causing public dissatisfaction and leading to the brewing of a refusal-to-pay movement. The Municipal Council, based on the emergency proposal of sixty to seventy councilors, first submitted it to the Public Utilities Subcommittee for research, and then convened a Provisional General Assembly to thoroughly debate and pass a compromise plan. He believed it was impartial and could take into account both the burden on citizens and the economic situation of the company. Only in this way could a more reasonable solution be reached. (2) The 50% increase in the index in the calculation method of the new price of public utilities this time has no basis. Moreover, whether this calculation method is reasonable is fundamentally questionable. If it is said that the burden on citizens can be arbitrarily increased after approval by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Council is not allowed to intervene, then if any refusal-to-pay or delay-to-pay movement occurs in the future, it cannot be said that the Municipal Council did not plan to eliminate it beforehand. Moreover, the Mayor once submitted a special case to the Municipal Council, hoping to organize an open investigation and deliberation committee to be responsible for approving price matters. Whether the Municipal Council has the right to do so still needs to be asked of the government authorities.

Monopoly Enterprises Have Their Responsibilities

(3) If each company relies on its public utility as a monopoly enterprise and arbitrarily threatens to stop supply, it is deliberately disrupting social order and is absolutely intolerable to citizens. It must be known that all monopoly enterprises have their rights, and they must also have their responsibilities, both in normal times and especially in extraordinary times. It is deeply believed that if the authorities of Chinese and foreign companies recognize the times and face reality, they will not take such a bad policy, otherwise they will betray the painstaking efforts of the Municipal Council and will inevitably suffer the consequences. In the event of last resort, the people's organ has the right to require the local government to temporarily take over any company that deliberately threatens, in accordance with the methods used by the British and American governments to deal with coal mine strikes during the war, in order to prevent the lives of citizens from being affected.

Hoping that the Government Has a Long-Term Vision

(4) I had long anticipated that the repeated price increases of public utilities would inevitably lead to social unrest, so I repeatedly appealed to the central government to pay attention to it, or to adopt subsidies, or to grant loans, and to pre-settle three months of foreign exchange to pre-purchase three months of fuel and materials in order to strive for the stability of public utility prices, thereby reducing the stimulus of general price increases. Unfortunately, the central authorities have a very short-sighted vision and regard it as insignificant. It is hoped that in the future, it can face reality squarely, strive for long-term goals, and strive to make public utilities sustainable and the people's burden can be reduced. If the trend of general price increases can be slowed down as a result, the central government will have gained a great deal.

### Wu Kaixian Returns to Shanghai and Discusses the Reasons for High Prices

[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has returned to Shanghai after his vacation from Taiwan. When reporters interviewed Director Wu yesterday, he said: The price of rice in Taiwan is much lower than in this city, currently only over ten million legal tender per stone. If it is smuggled into the country, the profit is very high, so the Taiwan Provincial Government pays close attention to rice smuggling. More than one hundred refugees from this city were evacuated to Taiwan, but Taiwan Province does not welcome this. The main reason for the high prices in this city is the excessively high interest rates of businesses. If newspapers regularly publish weekly deposits from businesses, the principal and interest can be repaid in more than fifty days. The business must lend out at even higher interest rates in order to make a profit. How can this not stimulate prices? As for warehouse inspections, the general survey can be carried out this week because various survey forms were not printed last week.

### Zhao Junhao and Others Propose to Open Low-Price Buses in the Morning

In addition, at the Provisional General Assembly on the 14th, more than ten councilors, including Councilor Zhao Junhao, proposed that each transportation agency in the urban area should operate low-price buses for two hours every morning, charging half price. This proposal will also be submitted for review.

### Few Moviegoers; Film Distributors Still Want to Raise Prices; Film Industry to Discuss Solutions Tomorrow

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the publication of the cost of living index for the first half of this month, movie theaters feel great difficulty in whether to raise prices. Film distributors are determined to demand that ticket prices should still be increased according to the index, otherwise they will stop supplying new films again. However, the theaters themselves believe that ticket prices have not been adjusted for long, and the box office has been sluggish for half a month, which proves that the purchasing power of the audience has gradually weakened, so they do not advocate raising prices again for the time being, so as not to affect business. In order to reconcile the opinions between the two parties and discuss an appropriate solution, the Film Industry Association will convene a meeting on the 18th for discussion. It is heard that the theaters are already communicating with the film distributors, and the final possible solution is to adopt a weekly increase in prices.

### Prosecutor States That Deng Zhonghe's Accusation Case Is Not Related to Special Contribution; Plaintiff Is a Kuomintang Member

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Deng Zhonghe, the owner of the Huizhong Hotel and the director of the Anle Textile Factory in this city, who was reported to the High Procuratorate by the victim Zhu Zhengwen for the crime of traitor, has attracted much attention. Reporters from various newspapers in this city visited Luo Shouchang, the prosecutor in charge of the High Procuratorate, yesterday morning. He first denied the rumors that this case was related to the special relief contribution. He then said that in addition to paying 60 billion in bail, the defendant also has three reliable shop guarantors: Donglai Bank, Huizhong Hotel, and Daqing Automobile Company. Prosecutor Luo seemed to indicate the seriousness of his crimes. He refused to disclose the facts of the crime reported by the plaintiff in this case during the investigation period, only saying that the office had collected evidence and investigated the facts from all relevant parties, hoping to obtain the truth as soon as possible.

It is reported that the plaintiff in this case, Zhu Zhengwen, is currently a member of the Agricultural and Industrial Committee of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Department. During the war, he worked underground for the Central Government in Shanghai and was known to Deng, who colluded with the enemy and puppets to urge the pseudo-special agents to detain Zhu, inflict cruel torture, and release him after he was disabled. Zhu secretly fled back to Chongqing for treatment. Although Zhu has now returned from Chongqing, his scars still ache, so he filed a complaint with the High Procuratorate, accusing Deng of hindering his personal freedom by relying on the power of the enemy and puppets.

According to Li Ling, because she was deceived by Liu, she committed suicide by taking poison in Pingdu in April, and the matter was widely reported in Pingjin newspapers.

However, the rumor that they played mahjong together at the time, and as a result, Li lost two taels of gold, and Liu generously did not care, so the relationship developed, which Li said was not true.

Xuan said: The competent department of the Ministry of National Defense believes that the Beijing-Shanghai area is important. In order to ensure tranquility, it has been proposed to implement a total war in accordance with the methods of the Subei Appeasement Zone, with military affairs as the main focus. All political and economic measures are subject to its supervision, in order to use the overall strength to first eliminate the scattered bandits and then seek political innovation and economic stability. This plan is currently under review by the highest authorities. Xuan continued: If the plan to implement total war in Songhu is realized, Jiang Jingguo's appointment as Deputy Commander will be enough to excite the citizens who generally place high hopes on Jiang.

People in Songhu Have High Hopes

He said that Jiang's ideals and views are very close to his. Whenever a major event occurs in Shanghai, there are rumors that Jiang will come to Shanghai to take a certain position. This shows the general people's desire for Jiang. He once sent a letter to Jiang some time ago, explaining the feelings of the people in Songhu, and he also represented one of the citizens to express his welcome. Recently, he sent a telegram to the President, urging him to issue Jiang's appointment as soon as possible.

The Organization of the Police Department Will Be Expanded

When asked by reporters whether the jurisdiction and organization of the Songhu Garrison Command would be expanded when the total war is implemented, Xuan replied that the expansion of the jurisdiction is actually impossible, but the internal organization will be expanded to meet new needs. For example, an agency responsible for political work will be established in the political field, and an agency will also be established in the economic field. However, although the implementation of total war is mainly military, a joint agency that cooperates with politics will be established in the execution.

### Releasing Smuggled Steel Cables, Demanding Rewards Causes Internal Strife, Many Supply Bureau Inspectors Prosecuted

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Shuping, a Hangzhou native and staff member of the Delivery Group of the Storage and Transportation Department of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, was previously stationed at the Kaiping Wharf to handle the delivery of surplus U.S. military supplies shipped from abroad by the bureau. Shao Guozheng, Yang Chongshun, Yan Xifan, Wang Yicheng, Li Baofan, Liu Lanxin, Ding Wenjun, Sheng Bianquan, and Wang Zemin were all inspectors from the bureau's Inspection Brigade, stationed at various wharves to inspect the loading and unloading of materials. On the 25th of last month, Ge Xingkun, an outside employee of the Li Yongji Stevedoring Company in this city, learned that the Clark Perrey Victory, a ship chartered by the Materials Supply Bureau, was shipping surplus U.S. military supplies from Guam to Shanghai. Several foreign sailors on board were carrying ten bundles of steel cables hidden in the cabins, intending to smuggle them into Shanghai for sale. However, due to strict wharf security, they were unable to land. Ge then consulted with Chen Shuping, whom he knew well. Chen introduced Ge to Shao Guozheng, who was on duty on the ship. Ge was then able to directly negotiate the purchase of the steel cables with the foreign sailors on the ship. At around 12:00 AM on the 28th of the same month, Ge rowed a small sampan to the ship to unload the goods. However, because loading a large amount of steel cables late at night and sailing on the Huangpu River would easily arouse suspicion from the police, Shao Guozheng introduced Yang Chongshun and Li Baofan to assist, allowing Ge to escort the goods away from the ship. At the same time, Yan Xifan demanded a reward from Ge, who paid him US$40. Then, through Guo Xunxu, an inspector who is currently at large, for fear that the inspectors would witness the previous events during their duty and report them, the money was divided equally. Shao Guozheng, Yan Xifan, Wang Yicheng, Li Baofan, Liu Lanxin, Ding Wenjun, Sheng Bianquan, and Wang Zemin each received US$5.50, and they discussed and asked Shao Guozheng and others to agree to cooperate and keep the secret, to which everyone gladly agreed. The next day, Yang Chongshun, because he did not receive a reward for escorting the steel cables, went to Ge's residence to demand 500 million 法幣 (legal tender). Ge, seeing that the profit from buying the steel cables was very small, refused to pay. Yang then pulled out a sharp knife and threatened him. After Guo Xunxu mediated, Ge paid 100 million 法幣 to settle the matter, and Guo then took the opportunity to extort US$20 and left. That afternoon, Chen Shuping and Shao Guozheng also tracked down to Ge's house to demand a reward, and stated that it was not yet known whether the steel cables were public property of the Supply Bureau. If he was stingy and did not pay the reward, they would report to the competent authorities to confiscate and punish him, as a threat. Ge, fearing the crime, was forced to pay Shao Guozheng US$10, and invited Chen Shuping and others to a meeting in a Sichuan restaurant on Edward Road the next day. At that time, Ge took out 40 million 法幣. Chen and others thought the amount was too small and refused to accept it, and left with complaints. Later, Chen deeply resented that Shao and Guo had received generous rewards alone and were unwilling to share them, so he negotiated sternly with Shao and Guo, almost to the point of violence. Shao, fearing that Chen would report to the Supply Bureau first, jointly with Yan Xifan, Guo Xunxu, Wang Yicheng, Li Baofan, Liu Lanxin, Ding Wenjun, Sheng Bianquan, and Wang Zemin, submitted a written report to the bureau's supervisors. The bureau then summoned Chen, Ge, and others to the bureau. However, Guo Xunxu had already taken the opportunity to flee without a trace on the 30th of the same month. The bureau transferred all the case files to the District Procuratorate for investigation, which has now concluded, and they have been prosecuted separately for violating the regulations on punishing smuggling and for the crime of intimidation.

### Eid al-Fitr in Dihua, Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, and Various Ethnic Muslims Gather

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Dihua on the 11th] While Muslims going to Mecca are packing their luggage and flying out of Shanghai, the Muslims in Dihua City have spent a month of spiritual cultivation in the fast, and under the hot air currents of the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, they are in the most joyful mood, celebrating their annual Eid al-Fitr.

The New Province Price Control Agency also has a large amount of clear oil and mutton, and a large amount of fair-priced sales. The Provincial Civil Servants Cooperative also sells white sugar and rice (limited to Muslims) at low prices. The Youth Service Agency is also afraid that poor Muslims will not have the funds to celebrate the festival, and specially issued the poverty relief fund of 40 million new currency before the festival to subsidize them.

Civil Servants Take Three Days Off

It is no exaggeration to say that this year's Eid al-Fitr is unprecedentedly grand. In fact, the New Provincial Government announced that Muslim civil servants of its affiliated agencies would take three days off from August 6, and non-Muslim civil servants also benefited from it, taking one day off. Early in the morning of the 7th, in the Muslim area near Nanliang, every household hung flags and decorations, and gongs and drums were noisy.

The entire city of Dihua does not yet have a mosque that can accommodate so many people, so it had to be held on the playground of this highest institution of learning in the border region.

Solemn and Dignified Prayer Ceremony

The prayer ceremony was presided over by Uyghur Grand Imam Muhammad Niyaz, and the leaders of various ethnic Muslims, Chairman Masud, Chief Teacher Ma Liangjun, Secretary-General Aisha, Chairman Cheng Jisi Khan, etc., all attended and delivered speeches successively, stating that: The peace and stability of the province and the unity of the nationalities are symbols of a new record being created today, and a new guarantee is obtained today. Every Muslim silently made sincere prayers for the prosperity and well-being of New China and the stability and progress of Xinjiang in accordance with the established solemn and dignified ceremony.

Non-Muslims Go to Pay Congratulations

On the other hand, non-Muslim military and political leaders gathered at the New Building at 10:00 AM, a total of more than 30 people, led by Tao Jian, the commander of the station, who had just arrived in Xinjiang for only two or three days, and traveled in a snake-like car procession through the entire urban area, to pay New Year's greetings separately to the Muslim leaders, Ahong. gentry's home. At Chairman Masud's official residence, at Commander Ma Chengxiang, Grand Teacher Ma, Secretary-General Aisha, Director Wang, Director Yimin, Deputy Director Bai and the private residences of major Ahong, there were unusually enthusiastic celebrations and answers, and the hosts entertained guests with self-made oil fragrance and clear tea. They were particularly honored by the arrival of Commander Tao Jian.

Enthusiastic Performance of Songs and Dances

The five-act song and dance drama "Miss Ni Yaz," which was performed to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, is Chairman Mai's proud masterpiece, directed by Muhammad Emati Haji and performed by the entire Youth Song and Dance Troupe (ie Xinjiang Song and Dance Visiting Troupe). As soon as it got dark, the entrance to the Uyghur General Association was already crowded. Upstairs and downstairs, there was no place to stand in an instant. The number of tickets sold broke the record of any previous public performance. Nanliang Square also showed movies to entertain the people for free.

On the third day of Eid al-Fitr, Muslim women appeared on the streets to pay New Year's greetings to each other, dressed in red and green, with gorgeous clothes and ornaments. The colors of the cars and horses were dazzling and filled with joy. (Lin)

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Suzhou on the 14th] Chen Lian, director of the Shanghai Supply Bureau of the Joint Logistics Department, came to Suzhou to raise 1,500 large bags of brown rice from all walks of life because military grain was in urgent need at this time when the old and new crops were not yet harvested.

Until 6:30 PM, after repeated appeals from County Chief Wang, the representatives reluctantly agreed to the loan.

### Romantic Case in Jinan, Wang Zhang's Wife Unable to Endure Loneliness, Old Widower Stirred Up a Sea of Jealousy

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Jinan on the 16th] A unique love triangle comedy of catching a adulterer by a cuckold has recently occurred here. Wang, who lives at No. 31 Nanchenggen Street, Jinan City and is an elementary school teacher in Licheng, usually lives in Licheng due to work reasons. His wife, Zhang, who is 22 years old, unable to get used to the hardship of an empty bed, had an affair with Li Tongxuan, a young man in the same courtyard. However, good things are often hindered. The privacy of Li and Zhang was also discovered by Ma, an old widower over half a century old in the same courtyard, who used this to threaten and force Zhang to commit adultery, thus forming a triangular situation. Finally, a sea of jealousy was stirred up. On the night of August 14th, Ma suddenly broke into Zhang's room, hoping for the pleasure of flying together. But Li Tongxuan had already entered before him. Ma saw the scene and could not help but be burned by jealousy, shouting to catch the adulterer, and dragged Li and Zhang to the Sanhejia Police Station.

The office immediately secretly sent officers to strictly search and arrest him, and sent a letter to the Jinan Military Police Joint Investigation Office to step up the search to arrest Liu and others and bring them to justice.

### After the issuance of 250,000 face value Customs Gold Units (關金劵), the Cash Panic Gradually Relieved, The Market Response Was Quite Good and Prices Did Not Change Drastically

[Report from Our Newspaper] Customs Gold Units (關金劵) with a face value of 250,000 were issued in various places yesterday. The issuing bureau of the Central Bank stated that they will supply it according to the needs of the market and will not issue it without limit. According to this, most of the large banknotes are used by those who go to other places, so as of now, few are circulating in this city. The financial authorities hope that the cash panic in various places can be relieved after the issuance of this Customs Gold. The widespread circulation of banknotes in the past two weeks is a distorted phenomenon under the cash panic, and the Gold Control Bureau has decided to strictly ban it from today.

Also, although yesterday was the day of issuance of the huge Customs Gold, the market conditions for gauze and daily necessities fell across the board by 10%, and the Chinese stocks also fell unanimously, which was beyond the expectations of ordinary citizens. Analyzing the reasons, it is probably nothing more than the following points: (1) Although yesterday was the day when huge Customs Gold was issued, in order to prevent price fluctuations, in addition to tightening the money supply, the Economic Inspection Bureau dispatched all personnel to monitor the main markets throughout the day. (2) The rise in the cost of living by 80% to 90% has a negative impact on the Chinese stock market. At the same time, manufacturers need a large amount of money to pay wages, and many people are throwing out supplies. There are many suppliers, which affects general prices. (3) Negative news is frequently spread, and there are many rumors. For example, Ambassador Stuart and Shao Lizi were summoned to Gu, and the rumors were revived. The authorities' cautious and thorough consideration of the new economic plan, and their holding back from releasing it, made general speculators believe that there might be drastic measures in it, which made them deeply vigilant. This point has a great impact on the market mentality.

### Silver Tightness Causes Panic; Chinese Stock Market Trends Downward

Yesterday's Chinese stock market was weak, primarily due to tighter credit conditions. Police surveillance of the market discouraged buying. Even the large amount of customs gold released yesterday failed to stimulate prices.

Yong Sha opened at 15,500 yuan in the morning, down 400 yuan from last weekend, showing weakness. Stocks No. 154, 153, 225, and 170 initially declined, but then rose to 15,800 yuan. However, this was short-lived. Lacking support from major investors, individual investors became cautious and selling pressure increased. Stocks No. 83, 196, 180, 164, 65, 224, 176, 12, and 55 were sold off, gradually falling to 15,200 yuan. Short sellers covered their positions at lower prices, and buyers struggled to rally, rising several times to 15,400 yuan. Due to tighter credit, securities firms had outflows but no inflows. Short sellers feared losses and closed positions. Stocks No. 78, 65, 224, 197, 220, and grain merchants sold heavily, causing prices to plummet to a low of 15,150 yuan. The general decline in commodity prices outside the stock market further exacerbated the situation, with more sellers than buyers leading to a complete collapse. Near the close, stocks No. 197, 71, and 55 were bought. Yong Sha closed at 15,280 yuan. Small-cap stocks declined rapidly due to widespread selling by individual investors. Jingfu and Xinguang once reached 90 yuan and 140 yuan, respectively, but closed at 88 yuan and 137 yuan, resulting in a loss of over 50%. Zhongshui reached the daily limit down. Only Xinyi showed gains due to news of a capital increase, attracting buyers. Yong Sha and other stocks fell by varying amounts, up to 50%.

In the afternoon, Yong Sha opened at 15,500 yuan. Stock No. 89 was bought up to 15,600 yuan. Stocks No. 196, 319, 54, and 230 were sold off at higher prices, causing a decline to 15,480 yuan. Short sellers covered their positions, and yarn prices rose again, creating favorable conditions for buying. Stocks No. 187, 65, 200, 22, 183, 178, 55, and 30 were bought at lower prices. New buyers gradually entered the market, pushing prices up to 15,800 yuan. Although Stock No. 224, 216, and 54 were sold off to 15,630 yuan, the National Bank's injection of over 40,000 billion yuan slightly eased credit and improved sentiment. Evening news helped boost buying, and the market turned from weak to firm. Stocks No. 178, 187, 152, 156, 47, and 169 were heavily bought, reaching a high of 15,900 yuan. However, short sellers closed their positions for profit, and stocks No. 190, 65, 61, 154, 224, and 169 were sold again. Yong Sha closed at 15,700 yuan. In the end, Xinyi was still at the daily limit up, and Yong Sha saw a slight increase. Unlisted stocks also showed positive performance.

Government Bonds

Due to excessive gains in recent days, bank selling led to a decline. Tong Bing opened at 2.18 million yuan. Rooms 614, 552, and 550 bought on the dip, reaching 2.3 million yuan. However, Rooms 500, 503, and 360 sold, and Chengde also sold on behalf of banks, gradually declining to 2.06 million yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 4-5 million [unclear unit]. In the end, Type C bonds fell by 200,000 yuan, and Type A and B options fell slightly by 20-30,000 yuan. Type D and E bonds also declined by 80,000 yuan and 110,000 yuan, respectively.

### Hong Kong Issues New Order Restricting Pound Remittances

[United Press Hong Kong, 15th] Hong Kong has issued a new order restricting the flow of pounds between Hong Kong and the sterling area. Starting Sunday, pound remittances between Hong Kong and the sterling area will be limited to 500 pounds, except for: (1) bona fide imports and exports; (2) payment of insurance premiums; (3) necessary travel expenses; and (4) payment of dividends and interest. (Note: The old order only restricted remittances between Hong Kong and London.)

### Remittance Income Increasing

Expected to Reach 300 Billion This Month

A Bank of China official stated that since the price of foreign exchange certificates was adjusted dynamically, remittance income from overseas Chinese has increased. In May, before the implementation of the foreign exchange certificate system, total remittance income was only 27.8 billion yuan. After adopting the foreign exchange certificate system in June, it increased to 251.6 billion yuan. The total income for July is still being calculated and is expected to increase to over 300 billion yuan. Recently, remittances from the Philippines and Southeast Asia accounted for the largest share. In addition to exchange rate adjustments, domestic exchange rates are also being adjusted to attract remittances. Currently, if remittances from overseas Chinese are sent to Shanghai through private remittance agencies and then to Xiamen, Guangzhou, etc., the remittance fees are extremely high, with only 6 million yuan received for every 10 million yuan remitted. If the Bank of China transfers the remittances to those areas, no remittance fees are charged, and 10 million yuan remitted will result in 10 million yuan received. This greatly benefits overseas Chinese, so remittance income is expected to continue to increase.

### Financial Supervisory Bureau Orders Banks to Establish Transfer Journals

[Our Correspondent] The Municipal Financial Supervisory Bureau has repeatedly received reports from inspectors that banks, money shops, and trust companies have largely failed to establish transfer journals, or even if ledgers exist, the records are unclear, which is not in compliance with regulations. The Financial Supervisory Bureau has now notified the Municipal Bankers Association, the Money Shops Association, and the Trust Companies Association to order all banks and companies to immediately implement uniform accounting methods and establish transfer journals with detailed records for inspection and to severely punish violations.

### Credit Tightens and Then Eases; Banks Inject Large Amounts

Yesterday, credit in Shanghai first tightened and then eased. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a large net outflow of funds during the exchange of bills and notes among the financial institutions, totaling 415.07 billion yuan. Among them, the Central Bank had the largest net outflow of 66.134 billion yuan. The Bank of China had a net outflow of 74.42 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had a net outflow of 61.8 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank had a net outflow of 10.487 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau had a net outflow of 7.513 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau had a net outflow of 3.487 billion yuan, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net outflow of 3.092 billion yuan. Commercial banks had a net outflow of 29.656 billion yuan in large exchanges and a net outflow of 13.990 billion yuan in small exchanges. Foreign banks had a total net outflow of 25.84 billion yuan. According to sources at the Central Bank, the large outflow yesterday was mainly due to payments for the purchase of foreign exchange certificates and exchange remittances.

### Weak Sales and Profit-Taking Lead to Decline in Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices; Yarn Management Committee Suspends Yarn Sales

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw tighter credit, rising shadow interest rates, and falling cotton cloth and stock prices, leading to weak sentiment. Buyers were cautious, sales were sluggish, and profit-taking increased.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened with a sharp drop of 280 million yuan. Later, due to the Spinning and Weaving Company's announced price reduction, manufacturers offered supply, and the market fell by 50 million yuan. After fluctuating in the middle, it closed at 2.9 billion yuan for immediate delivery and 3 billion yuan for delivery tomorrow, a further drop of 330 million yuan from the weekend. Other counts of yarn also declined by 100-200 million yuan, with 58 transactions.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw continued tightening of credit and the authorities' restrictions on remittances to North China, leading to selling by northern merchants and profit-taking by individual investors. Dyeing factories and local merchants reduced orders, and sales were sluggish, causing sentiment to weaken.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially fell by 5.8 million yuan. Although it rebounded in the middle, it finally settled at 76.8 million yuan, a further drop of 8 million yuan from the weekend.

Other fine cloths, serge, and coarse twill also declined rapidly. However, dyed cloth and shilin cloth were more resilient, with 3,020 pieces traded.

News after the market close indicated that the yarn and stock markets stabilized. Dragon Head fine cloth was bid up to 77.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, under strict police supervision, trading became even more secretive, with very few transactions. Dragon Head fine cloth rose again from 79 million yuan to break the 80 million yuan mark, up 3.2 million yuan from the morning. Four Gentlemen serge also rose by 3.5 million yuan.

The Yarn Management Committee has suspended the sale of yarn and cloth, with all sales entrusted to the China Textile Corporation. However, due to the significant decline in yarn prices yesterday, there were not many applications to purchase from the China Textile Corporation. The China Textile Corporation has sold yarn in two rounds. The first round sold 660 pieces (equivalent to 20-count yarn), withdrawing 856.8 billion yuan from circulation. The second round sold 339 additional pieces, withdrawing 610.5 billion yuan from circulation.

[Our Correspondent] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhou ship exported over 4,000 pieces of yarn and cloth from Shanghai to Rangoon, shipped by the Foreign Trade Committee. Another 1,700 pieces of yarn and cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Wuxi Quotes Plunge; Rice Prices Fall Yesterday; Flour, Grain, Oil, and Cake Prices All Decline Sharply

The rice market declined from its peak due to tighter credit and a sharp drop in prices in Wuxi, causing considerable panic. Sellers became eager to sell. The Nanshi market initially fell by 3-4 million yuan. The Zhongshi market was the weakest, falling by 4-5 million yuan. The market recovered slightly at the close, ending down by about 3-4 million yuan. However, high-quality rice only fell by 1-2 million yuan. In the Beishi market, white japonica rice fell below the 60 million yuan mark, and early thin rice also fell by about 4 million yuan. Special high-quality rice remained at 66 million yuan due to scarcity, with only a slight decline of 1 million yuan. Total arrivals in the north and south markets yesterday were 6,200 dan.

Flour

Declined sharply, with the sudden tightening of credit being the main reason. The general decline in other commodity prices led sellers to rush to sell, causing prices to fall sharply. Old brand flour opened at 22.3 million yuan and further declined to 21.15 million yuan, a drop of 1.9 million yuan. Bingchuan flour was at 20.5 million yuan, a drop of 2.2 million yuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng flour each fell by 2.3 million yuan, a decline of about 10%. Miscellaneous brand flour uniformly fell by 2 million yuan. Large bags of bran fell by 1.12 million yuan. Bran factories quoted 28 million yuan, but sellers refused to sell, so no transactions were made.

Grains

Declined across the board. Tighter credit reduced buying by merchants. Prices of other commodities also declined, causing panic. Sellers became eager to sell. Soybeans ultimately fell by 2-3 million yuan. Broad beans had limited transactions, with prices falling by 2 million yuan. New corn arrivals in Shanghai gradually increased, falling by 3 million yuan. Yuan wheat saw Shantou merchants withdraw, and northern merchants did not buy much, leading to a sharp drop of 5 million yuan. Green beans had no actual sales, falling by 4-5 million yuan. Sesame saw Tianjin merchants not buying, while local merchants conducted some trading, falling by 4-5 million yuan. Raw peanuts fell by 8-9 million yuan.

Cooking Oil

Declined sharply. With the sudden tightening of credit, holders were forced to sell due to cash flow issues. Oil factories also offered supply, causing panic and prices to fall by about 10%. Soybean oil initially was at 145 million yuan, briefly rising to 148 million yuan in the middle, but ultimately closing at the opening price, a drop of 14 million yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 127 million yuan, also a decline of 10%. Jitone rapeseed oil and small cart sesame oil each fell by 15 million yuan. Soybean cake had no demand from merchants and no actual sales. The market fell sharply by 3.3-3.4 million yuan.

### Rain-Soaked Football Match: Loss to Turkey; Report on the World Olympics Football Team's Crushing Defeat

— By our Special Correspondent, Zhong Zhen

[Our Correspondent's Dispatch from London] Today, August 2nd (Monday), is a bank holiday in England. All government offices and large stores in London are closed. However, the World Olympics events held in the suburbs continued as usual.

The weather today was overcast and rainy from early morning. As expected, when I left the Wembley Royal Swimming Pool after watching the men's 800-meter relay at 3:30 PM, it started to rain. I rushed to the track and field to watch the men's 400-meter final and the pole vault selection. After finishing, I hurriedly took a bus to the Walthamstow football field in the suburbs of London to watch our football team's first match against Turkey. At 9:00 PM, our basketball team will play its first round-robin match against Belgium at the Haringey Fitness Center. Therefore, the whole afternoon was spent traveling back and forth between the major sports venues in London in pouring rain, leaving me feeling physically and mentally exhausted.

Heavy Rain; Physical Exhaustion

At 6:30 PM, our Chinese football team played its first match against Turkey at the Walthamstow football field in London. Despite the pouring rain, the audience was still very crowded, and both the north and south stands were completely full. Many overseas Chinese from the UK came to support the team. Unfortunately, the weather was unfavorable, and it rained heavily during the match. The wet and slippery field greatly affected the team's offense. Coupled with physical exhaustion and bad luck, the second half turned into a one-sided affair. The Chinese football team, which is highly regarded by foreign audiences, finally failed to score and suffered an unprecedented defeat. The lineup and match details of our team are recorded as follows:

Chinese Team Lineup

Zhang Banglun

Yan Shixin Hou Rongsheng

Liu Songsheng Song Lingsheng Hao Rongsheng

Li Dahui Xie Wenliang Zhu Yongqiang Zhang Jinhai He Yingfen

First Goal Lost Within Five Minutes

At exactly 6:30, the band first played the national anthem of the Republic of China, and the entire audience stood at attention to pay respect. Next, the Turkish national anthem was played, and then the opening kick-off ceremony was held. As soon as the referee blew the whistle, the Turkish team galloped forward, heading straight for the Chinese goal with great momentum. Our team quickly defended, forcing a corner kick. The Turkish team's right-wing shot powerfully, and center forward Kendy headed the ball into the upper left corner of the goal, breaking the net with a resounding sound. Zhang Banglun was unable to save it. In less than five minutes, Turkey easily took the lead with a score of 1-0. After that, our team fought hard to counterattack. However, the Turkish defense was too tight, and they were unable to succeed. When the ball came into our team's hands, they often lost good opportunities due to the wet and slippery field, making it difficult to run. The forwards and wings were also slower, which was not comparable to the Turkish team's speed and running ability. In the first half, the Turkish offensive was very fierce, with many dangerous moments that were turned away by goalkeeper Zhang Banglun. In the midst of extremely thrilling waves, the first half ended with a score of 1-0. During the intense battle between the two teams, a group of dozens of Chinese naval personnel in the UK formed a cheering squad in the south stand to cheer for the team, while Turkey also had a cheering squad, and the two sides competed against each other outside the field.

Three Goals in a Row; The Situation is Lost

After a ten-minute break, the second half began. The rain was still heavy, and the players' spirit of fighting in the water was commendable. Ten minutes later, center forward Zhu Yongqiang shot powerfully from a distance, hitting the goalpost, just missing the mark. After that, our team repeatedly shot at the goal, but all were saved by the Turkish goalkeeper. Then, the Chinese team gradually ran out of energy. At 7:40, center forward Zhu Yongqiang's right knee was injured by a kick, making him unable to move and forced to leave the field. Our team was severely damaged and unable to resist. The Turkish team immediately took advantage of the opportunity to attack with lightning speed. Center forward Kendy shot from within the penalty area, and the ball went into the net with a bang, making the score 2-0. Less than two minutes later, the Turkish offensive became even more fierce, and the army drove straight in. The left-wing Zilu flipped over and swept angrily, and the ball broke the net again, making the score 3-0. At this time, the Turkish momentum was high. The right midfielder rushed into the prohibited area alone and shot from a distance, scoring another goal, making the score 4-0. Within these five minutes, Turkey scored three goals in a row, and the situation changed drastically. The Chinese team was ultimately unable to reverse the situation due to the loss of momentum. The game ended hastily with the efforts of nine people. Hundreds of overseas Chinese who came in the rain were full of lament and left. The biggest reasons for this defeat, in addition to the rain and bad luck, were that our football players were physically weaker and slower than the Turkish team, resulting in a crushing defeat of 0-4. After the battle, Mr. Chen Lifu, who came from the United States, personally visited the players' rest room to express his condolences, which made the players feel very grateful.

### Tap Water and House Tax

— Jing Wen

The tap water bill for July has arrived. A glance reveals over fifteen million yuan, nearly tenfold the amount of a typical month. Initially, I doubted it, fearing a mistake. Upon inquiry, it was explained that the reason June's bill was only a little over one and a half million yuan was that the last price increase was calculated from the day after the meter reading, thus benefiting from a one-time discount. This time, the accumulated deficit was added, resulting in a tenfold jump. However, no matter how it's explained, a water bill of fifteen million yuan a month is a significant expense for a salaried person, and further increases seem endless.

Yet, looking at the summer house tax bill that arrived simultaneously, including the municipal construction donation, it amounts to only fifty-one thousand yuan. This sum likely doesn't even cover the cost of the paper and printing for the triplicate house tax form plus a large envelope, let alone the significant labor involved in processing a house tax form. To claim that such taxes can enrich the national treasury is almost a joke.

I say this not to imply that I willingly pay high house taxes on top of expensive water and electricity bills, but rather because the measures taken by the authorities are so unreasonable that they are alarming. Public utilities like water and electricity have been increasing fees almost monthly, and their standards have far exceeded the cost of living index, even the price index. Why is it that foreign employees in China must be paid in US dollars when conducting business? Foreign public utilities and some municipal public utilities constantly cite rising prices of metal materials, fuel, etc., as reasons for increasing prices. However, we know that the largest metal and fuel merchants in Shanghai are foreign merchants. They are making enormous profits.

For example, several foreign oil companies, unable to repatriate all the profits earned in China over the years, have been massively acquiring real estate in Shanghai. We can see many gas stations occupying large areas in the most prosperous commercial and residential areas such as Nanjing East Road, Zhongzheng East Road, and Linsen West Road. The land in these areas is valued in hundreds and thousands of gold bars, so the total cost can be imagined. Therefore, although the rise in metal and fuel prices affects public utilities, it is still their own people who are profiting.

Therefore, even if public utilities are losing money, alternative ways to compensate should be found, and the public should not be exploited. Moreover, the extent to which Shanghai's major public utilities are losing money is unknown to outsiders. Considering the monthly salaries of tens or hundreds of millions paid to foreign senior staff, slightly reducing internal waste and expenses, in addition to simply raising prices, would also be a remedial measure. However, even with their current salaries, foreign employees are still complaining!

On the other hand, municipal revenue not only fails to keep up with the "leaps" of public utilities but also cannot catch up with the general cost of living index. House tax is one example. It is said that the average house tax paid before the war was equivalent to about one hundred US dollars, but today it is only around one and a half million yuan in national currency, which is only about one percent of the pre-war level. The situation with car license taxes is similar. In other words, the wealthier people are, the lower the proportion of taxes they pay. However, roads in other areas can go unrepaired for years, and the sanitation environment can be ignored, but the roads in the higher-class residential areas must still be kept fairly clean and smooth. This is what is meant by international appearance.

Because those who can afford to pay more tax are unwilling to pay, and the authorities are "inconvenienced" to collect taxes from them, Shanghai's municipal administration is in a helpless situation today. Municipal construction is not discussed, and even the salaries of employees have become a problem. Shanghai, known as the wealthiest city in the country, had to request emergency assistance from the central government last month to overcome the crisis.

I believe that there is undeniable truth to the criticism of government corruption, but it is inaccurate to say that the government is insatiably greedy for the people's money. Based on the policies of government agencies at all levels, at least there is no greed for the money of the wealthy. Past foreign exchange policies and the sale of state-owned enterprises in plans probably benefited some wealthy families!

Because the government cares too much about the interests of a few rich people, any measures that benefit the public but slightly disadvantage the rich cannot be passed smoothly. The property tax has not yet been agreed upon, and many protests have been raised. Relief special donations have been applied with both soft and hard tactics, but the donation from the "Paint King" is even less than a "little yellow fish"!

I believe that if the municipal authorities are determined to seek the welfare of the public, they should formally propose the donations that should and can be increased, without worrying about opposition. Although increasing taxes is something the public does not want to hear, everything must be reasonable. If prices can rise several times in a month and public utilities can rise four or five times at once, then it is unreasonable for legitimate taxes to lag far behind. I am not advocating that taxes should compete with commodity prices, but I believe that those who benefit from rising prices should return a portion of their profits to society through taxes. For example, specially increase the house tax for A and B grade houses, increase the vehicle license tax for self-owned cars, and re-evaluate the benchmark for business tax.

As long as the municipal authorities can earnestly achieve taking from the people and using for the people, they will surely gain the support of the people.

### Purple Qi Comes from the East

— Yu Jianhua

"Purple Qi Comes from the East" is a well-known story about Lao Tzu passing through the border. The Inner Biography of Guan Ling Yin says: "Guan Ling ascended the tower and looked around, seeing purple qi rising from the easternmost point and heading west. He rejoiced and said, 'A sage must be passing through the capital.' On the appointed day, he fasted and observed abstinence, and on that day, Lao Tzu was indeed seen." Therefore, Du Gongbu's poem also includes the line "Purple Qi coming from the east fills the Hangu Pass." The Record of Strange Things says: "Lao Tzu traveled west, and Guan Ling Yin Xi saw that there was purple qi floating over the pass, and Lao Tzu indeed passed by riding a green ox." The Biography of Lao Zhuang Shen Han in the Historical Records says: "Lao Tzu cultivated morality, and his teachings focused on hiding oneself and avoiding fame. After living in Zhou for a long time, he saw the decline of Zhou and left for the pass. Guan Ling Yin Xi said, 'You are about to go into seclusion, please write a book for me.' So Lao Tzu wrote the upper and lower chapters, speaking of the meaning of morality in more than five thousand words, and left, and no one knew where he ended up."

The existence of Lao Tzu is a question, and the era of Lao Tzu is also a matter of much debate. Earlier scholars mostly believed that he was contemporary with and earlier than Confucius, but modern scholars, based on the content of the Tao Te Ching, mostly conclude that he lived in the Warring States period. Lao Tzu has always been a mysterious and elusive figure. Later generations added mythological embellishments, and Taoist priests revered him as their ancestor, honoring him as the Supreme Old Lord. Thus, Lao Tzu became a sacred and inviolable figure. "Purple Qi Comes from the East" has also become a common subject in Chinese figure paintings.

Painting figures is difficult, and painting historical events is even more difficult. Painting figures can be free from the constraints of time, but painting historical events must be subject to the constraints of time. The most obvious things that show the era are clothing, headwear, carriages, houses, tables, chairs, and furnishings. Because these objects change greatly with different eras, if the research is not detailed, it is easy to make mistakes. The person painted will inevitably wear a Song Dynasty hat and a Tang Dynasty crown, a Jin Dynasty garment and a Han Dynasty dress, combining thousands of years into one, melting past dynasties into one furnace, neither donkey nor horse, and ridiculed by knowledgeable people. Painting historical events not only requires attention to the era but also to the region. The north and south are different, and the customs are also different. If you are not careful, you will inevitably move the scenery of the northern border to Guangdong and the waves of the East China Sea to the shifting sands. This problem did not start today, and even ancient masters could not avoid it. Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty had already discussed it in detail. The Record of Famous Paintings of Past Dynasties says: "When discussing clothing, carriages, local customs, figures, ages are different, and the north and south are different. The appropriateness of viewing paintings lies in careful examination. Just like Wu Daozi painting Zhong You, he wears a wooden sword. Yan Linggong painting Zhao Jun, she is already wearing a veil. One does not know that the wooden sword was created in the Jin Dynasty, and the Han hat was used in the current dynasty. Taking this as a general rule is also a disease of painting. For example, the scarf was passed down in the Han and Wei Dynasties, the crowd parted from the Qi and Sui Dynasties, the hood started in the Zhou Dynasty, and the scarf was created in Wude. How can Hu clothing and boots be easily applied to ancient images? How can robes and ribbons be used for modern people for a long time? Grass is not suitable for the northern border, and ox carts are not available in Lingnan. Distinguish the objects of ancient and modern times in detail, compare the customs of the local customs, and draw shapes according to things, and the era can be verified."

"Drawing shapes according to things, and the era can be verified," is in line with the modern painting school's advocacy of "art is a reflection of the times." If we apply the two standards of "era" and "region" to evaluate historical figure paintings of past dynasties, I am afraid that there will not be one perfect and accurate one out of a thousand. The details are not fully discussed, but only the painting title "Purple Qi Comes from the East" will be discussed. According to what I have seen, its era and region are all subject to error. According to the determination of modern scholars, Lao Tzu lived at least in the Warring States period. It is difficult to verify what the clothing of the Warring States period looked like. It is impossible to determine its right or wrong, but modern people paint many obvious errors besides clothing. Ordinary paintings are mostly of an old man with a white beard riding on a water buffalo, followed by a boy with a set of thread-bound books in his hand. I don't know that there are no water buffalo in the Central Plains. The green ox that Lao Tzu rode is what Shanghai people call the yellow ox (yellow cattle have three colors: yellow, green, and black and white). As for thread-bound books, they only appeared after the Song Dynasty. The Warring States period was still in the era of "carving bamboo slips," so how could there be this complete set of thread-bound books? Recently, I saw Xu Beihong's painting exhibition, and there was also "Purple Qi Comes from the East." The painting was still a water buffalo, and Lao Tzu held a scroll in his hand. Although this was hundreds of years earlier than thread-bound books, it was still an object from the Han and Tang Dynasties, not from the Warring States period. Moreover, according to the Historical Records, it was Guan Ling Yin who forced Lao Tzu to write a book, and Lao Tzu began to write the Tao Te Ching, not before leaving the pass. The book had already been written, so it seems that Lao Tzu should not have an unwritten book in his hand. Beihong's painting name is full of the world, but he cannot avoid the mistakes of Wu Daozi painting wooden swords and Yan Linggong painting veils. Others are even more needless to say! This shows the difficulty of painting historical figures, and the reason why there are fewer and fewer authors.

### Tea Party

— You Mojun

Tea party, abbreviated as tea party, is extremely popular today. In terms of its grand scale, it involves international social events, with ambassadors gathering, shaking hands in joy, and accompanied by dancing. All European and American countries attach great importance to it. In our country, it has existed since ancient times. The "Tea Dong Li" records that Qian Qi, whose style name was Zhongwen, had a "tea banquet" with Zhao Ju; he also often visited Sun's house and had a "tea party" with the Lang monk. However, this tea party was a truly veritable tea party, because what was "banqueted" and "met" was nothing but tasting "tea," which differed from the nature of Western customs.

The tea party in Shanghai, which caught the attention of the international community, began in 1897 AD, the twenty-third year of the deceased Qing Guangxu. On the tenth day of the tenth lunar month of that year, the Shanghai Dao Cai Jun, in imitation of Western customs, invited a tea party that evening to celebrate Empress Dowager Cixi's birthday. Thousands of Westerners from various countries attended, both men and women, and even Western merchants from Hong Kong and Hankou came to the meeting, because Westerners were curious, and because China had just created the tea party, they all felt honored to attend. When it was first proposed to invite a tea party, lawyer Dan Wen said to Jun: "I heard that you are inviting a tea party, opening up the Chinese atmosphere, and we Westerners are very happy to hear about it!" That evening, the directors of the Public Works Bureau said to Jun: "You have created this atmosphere, and the layout is gorgeous and meticulous. Even the most elaborate tea parties in Europe and America are only like this. Inviting this tea party is even better than China's continuous victories, so that people from all countries can see it and know that there are still people in China." Recorded in Cai Jun's "Diplomatic Debate." The grand occasion of that day, I think the data room of this newspaper must have details to check. At that time, officials were extremely conservative. Cai Jun had traveled all over the world and had a novel mind. He specially invited a tea party in imitation of Western customs, so it is no wonder that Westerners were surprised and praised him.

The second grand tea party in Shanghai was on the first day of the fourth lunar month in the year of the Wuxu Reform. At that time, Prince Henry of Germany was traveling in China, and wherever he went, he wanted Chinese local officials to prepare a yellow sedan chair to greet him in person! This matter was stopped by Cai Jun's efforts. Cai, representing the Qing court, invited a tea party. According to the "Diplomatic Debate," "On the first day of April, a tea party was invited. More than six hundred men and women attended. Prince Henry was very happy. Tea parties and dances are the most important things in Europe and America."

### Strange News from the Officialdom

— Lin

There is a small state in India called Kashmir. Although it is small, its location is quite important. It is a place where the conflict between India and Muslims is extremely intense. The monarch is fond of seclusion and does not ask about political affairs. All state affairs are left to the officials to make their own decisions. An American journalist once discovered a tax official who held as many as seven positions, and all seven positions were extremely idle, with almost nothing to do. The gentleman put seven desks in his office and went back and forth between the seven desks every day, approving his own reports to himself for fun.

### Mr. Deng Sanmu's Poetry Manuscript

### Ping Sister's Watch

— Xu Qinwen

After reading the short story collection "Childhood and Watch" by Mr. Chen Jiahua, from the first story "The Landlady" to the seventh story "The Maid," I only felt that the material was rich and the writing was simple and honest. After reading the last story "Childhood and Watch," I couldn't help but be deeply moved. This story is autobiographical. The story is about when the author was twelve or thirteen years old, because he was obsessed with ridiculous books such as "Investiture of the Gods" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants," he became mentally disordered, thin, yellow face, dark eyes, nocturnal enuresis, anorexia, afraid of ghosts, and dared not walk around casually. Because of the love of his family, he found Sister Ping to accompany him. At that time, she was fifteen years old, "two small braids, floral shoes, and round eyes." So they read books together, she told him stories, and went to the fields to take a walk together in the evening; not only as a friend, she also acted as his teacher and his nanny. She could sing and write well. After the mental disorder, he was timid, hated the night, hated the moon, and was afraid of seeing the twinkling stars, but with Sister Ping together, he liked the moon and loved to see the starry sky. Soon he recovered from his illness, and she went back, but she often came to see him. Later, she had grown up and was about to get married, and she came to his house to live for another month. On the eve of being urged back until the wedding date, she gave him a watch. The article wrote:

"It was a moonlit night. I was just walking in the garden when she quickly handed me the watch, as if afraid of being seen: 'Hide it well, don't lose it, and be good.'"

Then it wrote:

"The moonlight was very clear that night. I took the money and didn't leave immediately. Her facial expression was very unusual. I was secretly watching her. Her expression was still very excited, as if she wanted to cry."

Ten years have passed, and now the watch is still ticking, which is her heart. The deep sympathy shown between the two sexes due to pity is true love. She rescued him, and he was saved, which is her merit. Of course, he also loves what he has worked so hard to create. There is another paragraph in the article:

"I have a stubborn personality, and no one can do anything to me, but only Sister Ping, with one sentence from her, I will obey everything. I trust her. This is the power of love." They have already resonated with each other, but they cannot become a good couple because they are hindered by social conditions. But love cannot be contained. A watch was transferred under the moon, ticking, representing her heart. This is the expression of true feelings. Tick-tock, of course, it is very pleasant. I have never seen that watch, nor have I heard the sound with my own ears, but just by looking at it in writing, I am also very moved. This is the success of writing.
