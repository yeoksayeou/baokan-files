### 熱西重鎮灤平收稪　承德外圍匪作撤退準備　古北口外國軍向北堵擊

Luánpíng, a key town in Jehol, recaptured; bandits preparing to retreat from the outskirts of Chengde; National troops outside Gubeikou blocking and attacking from the north

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] The war situation in Jehol Province has taken a new turn. Luánpíng County, an important town southwest of Chengde, was recaptured by the National Army on the afternoon of the 9th. Military sources say that the bandits on the outskirts of Chengde, feeling the pressure of the concentrated main force of the National Army, are preparing to retreat.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 10th] The National Army has now completed its deployment for an offensive. The battle situation, which has been quiet for several days, will soon resume.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 10th] The original plan of the bandits in Jehol was to "swallow the small with the big" and defeat the National Army piecemeal. However, due to the National Army's mobile concentration of forces, the bandits consistently attacked empty targets. Finally, they lingered on the outskirts of Chengde, attempting to occupy Chengde with "human bullet" tactics. However, under the National Army's strict deployment, the bandits' scheme has not succeeded. Currently, the bandits are experiencing difficulties with troop supplies and provisions, and seem to be abandoning their offensive against Chengde. The National Army seized the opportunity to attack, recapturing strongholds such as Shuangtashan (Double Pagoda Mountain) and Shanchakou (Mountain Crossroads) on the 9th, forcing the bandits to flee westward. Reinforcements outside Gubeikou are also blocking and attacking from the north.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 10th] After the Jehol war shifted towards Chengde, Fengning (County) lost contact with this area. According to refugees who fled to this area: The county was besieged by more than 10,000 troops of the bandit's Third Column, starting from the 18th of last month. Our defending troops numbered less than 2,000, but they still held out for more than ten days. In the end, due to the overwhelming disparity in numbers, County Magistrate Zhang Deyang led his troops in a breakout at the end of last month. They have now reached Lao Pingding (Old Flat Top), at the junction of Feng (ning), Long (hua) and Luan (ping), where they are confronting the bandits.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 10th] On the 8th, the National Army in Changchun launched a three-pronged attack to clear out the bandit forces harassing the airport. The National Army will completely control the Dafangshen and Kuanchengzi airports to strengthen air transport. On the 9th, the Air Force used large formations to bomb the outskirts of Changchun, heavily damaging the bandit army positions at Fanjiatun. In addition, Changchun University sent a telegram to President Luo Yunping, who is in Pan, stating: "No food, no money, life is difficult, and shells frequently fall around the campus buildings."

Furthermore, Liu bandit's Eleventh Column has been cut off by the National Army in the northeastern area of Shanxian County, and its route of retreat has been severed. Also, the situation in Wenshang, Jining, and Yanzhou is stable.

On the afternoon of the 9th, the National Army west of Qihe on the north bank of the Yellow River defeated the bandit's Qi-Yu Independent Battalion, killing more than 100 bandits and capturing seven bandits including a deputy county magistrate. The area of Zhangxia South Qing Yangshu, Tumen, Jinzhuang in the Mount Tai area of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was harassed by the bandit's Thirteenth Column on the afternoon of the 9th, but they were repelled by the morning of the 10th. In addition, a portion of the bandit's New Eighth Column, which was originally based in Dawenkou, fled south through Wucun on the 7th. The Seventh Column fled to Qufu. The remnants of the bandit's Second Column, which had originally infiltrated northern Jiangsu and had been defeated by the National Army, fled northeast towards Tancheng through Xin'anzhen on the 9th.

[Our Xinpu Dispatch, 10th] 2,000 remnants of the bandit's Second and Twelfth Columns, who had circled back to southern Shandong, were blocked and heavily attacked by the National Army between A'hu and Chengtou in Donghai County on the morning of the 9th.

After harvesting, the bandits devised ways to transport them to southern China for sale. This is another ironclad proof of the harm that the Communist bandits are doing to the country and the people.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese organizations in Vietnam, China and France are currently conducting negotiations. The French side suddenly took unilateral action, and on the 8th dispatched police to close the Chinese Association in Hanoi. In addition, the French police authorities have been refusing to issue travel permits to overseas Chinese traveling to and from Haiphong and other places without a visa from the Bangzhang (association leader). This measure seems to involve the practical value of the Sino-French agreement on the issue of Vietnam, because the agreement clearly stipulates that overseas Chinese enjoy freedom of travel in Vietnam. It is reported that our consulate general here believes that this measure by the French side clearly violates the treaty and has lodged a protest with the French side today.

The discussion of routine cases then proceeded. Highlights are recorded as follows:

The loan amount for each stage of this year's tea loan was originally set at: (1) a maximum of 3 million yuan per dan for loans for processing raw tea; (2) a maximum of 4 million yuan per dan for loans for transporting and selling boxed tea, deducting the processing loan; (3) a loan of 5 million to 8 million yuan per dan for boxed tea used as collateral at export locations, deducting the transportation and sales loan. As the cost of tea production and sales has increased, various parties have requested adjustments to the loan amount. In order to complete this year's tea loan plan and effectively assist the government in controlling export materials, the Joint Treasury has adjusted the loan amount for each stage to: (1) a maximum of 4 million yuan per dan for processing loans; (2) a maximum of 5.5 million yuan per dan for transportation and sales loans, deducting the processing loan; (3) a loan of 8 million to 10 million yuan per dan for export collateral, deducting the transportation and sales loan.

(2) Approving Emergency Agricultural Loans for Flood-Stricken Hunan Province. Xiang, Zi, and Yuan Rivers in the province were flooded simultaneously, and the floods along the rivers in various counties were severe. The Joint Treasury recently received a notice from the Executive Yuan that, in order to assist in rescuing the countryside and restoring a second planting season, it has approved that the Farmers Bank should immediately instruct its local branches or assign personnel to go to the disaster areas to carry out emergency agricultural loans for replanting according to regulations.

The Kuomintang has made informal contacts regarding the Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Committee members of the Examination Yuan, promising to give the Democratic Socialist Party two positions each. However, because the nomination of the presidents of the two Yuans and the approval of the Supervisory Yuan are still pending, no decision has been made.

Editorial

### Stop Luang Phibuns' Anti-Chinese Movement

The anti-Chinese trend in Siam, which had been superficially quiet for two and a half years, has recently resurfaced with Luang Phibuns' rise to power. He issued new regulations for the management of overseas Chinese schools, followed by the closure of more than 30 overseas Chinese schools, threatening to unleash a storm. According to the new regulations, the existing 490 overseas Chinese schools should be reduced to 148, with restrictions on teachers and students. If the new regulations are implemented, 3,000 overseas Chinese school teachers will lose their jobs, and the increase of teachers will also be restricted; 200,000 overseas Chinese school students will be out of school, and the education of overseas Chinese children will also be restricted. Luang Phibuns' unfriendly provocative behavior is only one step in his anti-Chinese policy, and he will inevitably take further actions. When the old wounds between the two nations have not yet healed, the feelings of the Chinese people cannot withstand this stimulation. At present, domestic and foreign public opinion has expressed extreme hatred and dissatisfaction with Luang Phibuns' anti-Chinese actions. If the Siamese government does not have a high degree of vigilance, cherish the precious friendship in the history of China and Siam, and change its erroneous policies, then the evolution of the future situation is unpredictable.

The two great peoples of China and Siam have close historical and blood ties, and can truly be called "brotherly states." In fact, there has never been a conflict of interest between the two peoples of China and Siam. There are more than three million overseas Chinese in Siam, and their contribution to Siam and their assistance in the welfare construction of Siam are very significant. Overseas Chinese in Siam have never interfered in Siam's internal affairs, and they cherish Siam as much as they love their motherland. Such kind and pure residents are constantly subjected to discrimination by the country of residence and constantly endure cruel laws. Now even the freedom of their children to receive education is restricted. Does this world still have reason? Is there still a distinction between right and wrong? Today's Siam has returned to the state it was in two and a half years ago, not only discriminating against Chinese in education and propaganda, but also discovering that some narrow nationalist parties and groups have begun to discriminate against Chinese in action. The destruction of Chinese shops and the beating of Chinese people are the same as Hitler's expulsion of Jews. Can overseas Chinese still endure this hardship? The so-called Sino-Siamese diplomatic relations and the so-called Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship are simply a mockery of China!

Luang Phibuns' anti-Chinese actions are not accidental, but his consistent style. After the November 8th coup last year, we were deeply apprehensive about the revival of the anti-Chinese movement; later, Nai Khuang Aphaiwong took office, adopting a neutral line in domestic and foreign affairs. Nai Khuang treated overseas Chinese with goodwill, and the doubts of our people gradually disappeared. Unfortunately, on April 6th of this year, Luang Phibuns overthrew Nai Khuang's cabinet in a bloodless coup and came forward to form a cabinet. Public opinion generally predicted that the anti-Chinese movement would inevitably revive. Only a month later, after Luang Phibuns won the recognition of the Chinese government, he revealed his true colors. He is as extreme, fickle, prejudiced, and cruel as he was in the past, using anti-Chinese sentiment as the vanguard of his "nationalism." Just looking at his past history, one can know the consistency of his anti-Chinese actions, which is not accidental. On February 24, 1933, when the League of Nations discussed the Lytton Commission report, Siam expressed sympathy for Japan's invasion of our Northeast with the only abstention vote, which led to the rise of anti-Chinese sentiment. When the July 7th Anti-Japanese War broke out, Luang Phibuns, instigated by Japanese bandits, rose up to lead the anti-Chinese trend, suppressing the patriotic activities of overseas Chinese. On the anniversary of the Shanghai War, Siam arrested overseas Chinese in large numbers; 28 days later (September 10, 1938), Luang Phibuns ordered the police bureau to mobilize the Bangkok police, on the pretext of searching for opium, to arrest 4,703 overseas Chinese. The means of cruelty and abuse were shocking. As a result, excluding those released on bail, a total of 3,354 people were deported back to the country, and some who fled to the mountains were executed or disappeared, creating the highest record of anti-Chinese sentiment in the world. Later, Jian Phibuns promulgated a law stipulating that overseas Chinese schools must use Siamese language for teaching from kindergarten onwards. Although overseas Chinese schools petitioned reasonably, there was no result. In total, during this period (May to December 1939), 285 overseas Chinese schools were closed, and all overseas Chinese schools were almost completely suspended the following year. It was not until after the victory that they were restored, with an interval of eight years. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese children were out of school or did not receive education in their motherland. We are not only heartbroken when we think of this! In addition, the closure of newspapers and economic oppression almost completely suffocated the lives of overseas Chinese in Siam!

After Japan's defeat and surrender, Luang Phibuns should have been listed as a war criminal, but his cunning and fickleness escaped the punishment of righteousness. He was at large, once retreated into obscurity, and finally, with the November 8th coup last year, sowed the seeds of disaster for Siam's internal and foreign affairs. Now, he is practicing dictatorship in internal affairs, attacking dissidents, and Nai Khuang escaped death by assassination; in foreign affairs, he is chanting anti-Soviet and anti-communist slogans, using international contradictions to consolidate his regime. The anti-Chinese movement is being carried out from both internal and foreign affairs. He is unwavering and has repeated the old path of closing overseas Chinese schools. He will inevitably have no end and may use "nationalism" as a banner to more actively launch the anti-Chinese movement.

Luang Phibuns' actions are not only a threat to the survival of the more than three million overseas Chinese in Siam, but also a measure to destroy peace in the Far East. Our government has lodged a serious protest, demanding compensation for losses and guarantees that similar incidents will not occur in the future; however, Phibuns is still forcibly denying the truth and rejecting our country's reasonable demands. Our country cannot tolerate Luang Phibuns' anti-Chinese movement any longer, whether it is for the safety of millions of overseas Chinese or for the peace of Southeast Asia. We should immediately lodge another protest. If there is still no result, we should appeal to the United Nations and make an open statement to the world about all of Luang Phibuns' crimes, so that he does not escape the punishment of justice!

Merchants are mutually wary, and safety is worrying.

### Oil Mine in Longquanyi, Sichuan Province, Survey Largely Completed, Reserves May Rank First in the Southwest

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 7th] The Resources Committee has recently discovered a huge oil field along the Longquanyi Mountains. According to He Tang, an engineer from the Mineral Survey Office of the Resources Committee who is in charge of the survey, the huge oil field was discovered by the office and American petroleum experts in 1939. After a rigorous re-survey, it was confirmed that the synclinal structure of the Laojunlin Basin on the top of the mountain contains extremely rich petroleum, natural gas, and brine. Last year, British expert Song Maitian visited again and strongly recommended it to Chairman Weng Wenhao after returning to the capital, confirming that it was of great value. The Resources Committee then sent Mr. He to Sichuan in March of this year to preside over the survey. So far, he has worked for three months and completed most of the work. According to Mr. He, the mining area extends from Longquanyi to the south through Renshou Northwest to Zhong和, about 80 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide. The strata exposed in the axial part belong to the Cretaceous period and have a flowing well system. Crude oil can be found by drilling 2,000 meters. He believes that the reserves in the mining area may rank first in the Southwest, and work is being stepped up.

### Zhejiang Silkworm Cocoon Collection Largely Completed, Total Loans of 14 Trillion

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] The silkworm cocoon collection work in Zhejiang Province has largely ended. Most of the cocoon firms, except for a very few, have stopped weighing, and most of them were forced to stop weighing. The total number of cocoons collected is 90,000 dan. It is estimated that about 2,000 dan have not been reported to the province by the cocoon firms. Among them, 44,000祖 were purchased with loans, 34,000 dan were purchased with self-raised funds, and 12,000 dan were jointly dried cocoons. The total loans spent were about 14 trillion. There are several reasons why the number failed to meet the expected collection number: (1) low cocoon prices, (2) late allocation of funds, and (3) forcible buying and selling by servicemen in the countryside. Among them, the servicemen in the countryside suffered the most losses from forcible buying and selling, and most of the cocoon firms were unable to open for business and were forced to stop weighing. By the time the government paid attention, the collection had ended.

### Nantong National Daily Suddenly Destroyed by Students

Local Authorities Are Mediating

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 9th] The Nantong National Daily in this county was suddenly destroyed by some students from the medical department of Nantong College at around 10:00 PM on the 8th. It is reported that the newspaper published a news item on the 8th about a patient who died during surgery in a public hospital. The students believed that the hospital was now an affiliated hospital of the college, so they collectively went to the newspaper in the evening and destroyed the type, doors, and windows, causing heavy losses. The security organs rushed to the scene after hearing the news, but all the students involved had already fled. On the 9th, the newspaper borrowed the Sui Jing Daily and temporarily published an eight-page sheet. In the afternoon, a symposium was held to report on the process of the destruction. The board of directors held an emergency meeting and decided to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law, and recommended standing director Cheng Zongdi to go to Beijing and Shanghai to appeal for support. The newspaper put forward four requirements: punish the main students who caused the trouble, Nantong College should publicly apologize, compensate for the losses, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. The newspaper must wait for President Zhang to return to Nantong before making a definite reply. The First绥部, Nantong Garrison, County Government, and County Provisional Council invited both parties to discuss a reasonable solution this afternoon.

### Chambers of Commerce in Su, Xi, and Chang Counties Request Postponement of Temporary Income Tax on Merchants, Representatives Will Go to Beijing Today to Petition the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Chambers of Commerce in the counties of Su, Xi, and Chang along the Beijing-Shanghai Line sent representatives to Beijing on the 10th to jointly petition regarding the issue of the direct tax bureaus in those areas ordering merchants in the rice, grain, and mountain goods industries to withhold temporary income tax on merchants. Lu Xiaobo, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and others received reporters on the afternoon of the 10th and explained the reasons for the petition, saying that it is difficult for tax authorities to collect taxes from merchants whose whereabouts are uncertain. Now, the direct tax bureaus are ordering brokers to withhold tax payments, and if they do not withhold, they must pay compensation, which is unreasonable. The petitioning group planned to invite Jiangsu-籍 Legislative and Supervisory Committee members on the evening of the 10th, and decided to go to the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans on the 11th to petition, requesting the Legislative Yuan to amend the past tax laws and also requesting the relevant authorities to postpone the collection of this "temporary income tax on merchants."

The Macao government has detained the offending policeman Yang Xiong, who confessed that Zheng did not obey police orders at the time, so he fired to stop him and did not intentionally shoot him. The Zhongshan Journalists Association has decided to issue a nationwide telegram to appeal, urging the government to lodge a strong protest with the Portuguese authorities immediately.

### Traitor Zhou Xuechang Still Sentenced to Death

### Taiwan Public Education Treatment Not Adjusted Monthly, Provincial Administrative Meeting Resolves

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 10th] The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Meeting has completed the discussion of 129 cases today. Most of the afternoon was spent in heated debate on the temporary motion to adjust the treatment of public educators on a monthly basis. Later, Chairman Wei concluded that monthly adjustments would lead to serious financial obstacles, so it was established that the province's prices were relatively stable and there was no need to apply the monthly adjustment method. However, the treatment of public educators is meager, and the resolution was to improve it as much as possible within the scope of financial possibility. The conference is scheduled to close tomorrow morning. After the meeting, the reporter visited Secretary-General Xie, who believed that the meeting enabled the provincial government to understand the difficulties of the counties and cities, and the counties and cities were able to understand the intentions of the provincial government, which was a great gain.

### The Mystery of Yang Mei's Nine Years Without Food: Body May Contain Chlorophyll, Can Live Only on Sunlight, Air, and Water, Views Proposed by Female Pharmacist Fan Dao'an

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] Ms. Fan Dao'an, a pharmacist from West China University currently living in Taiwan, has unique views on the issue of Yang Mei's nine years without food, believing that Yang Mei's body contains chlorophyll and may live only on sunlight, air, and water as food. Ms. Fan Dao'an told reporters: I speculate that the functions in Yang Mei's body are more complex than those of ordinary people. In addition to having the functions of digestion and absorption like ordinary people, she may also have the function of synthesizing organic matter from elements such as carbon dioxide and water to provide nutrition for the body. Based on this premise, her nine years without food are not a strange saying containing yin and yang and the five elements, but it is not unscientific, because her body has special functions, so she can survive even without eating ordinary food. Her food may only be sunlight, air, and water, which is also in line with the principles of metabolism in biology, because the air she breathes and the water she drinks can be combined by sunlight to form nutrients and digested and absorbed by the stomach and intestines. The nutrients of ordinary people must be obtained from eating animals and plants. As for the inorganic matter (the substances needed by the body) in Yang Mei's body, it can also be obtained from the raw water she drinks, because raw water originally contains compounds such as iron, manganese, and arsenic. Therefore, since she has the supplement of organic matter (carbohydrates) and inorganic matter (minerals), she can survive for a long time without eating, which is scientifically sound. The eye worm in animals can make its own food for livelihood because its body contains chlorophyll. I speculate that Yang Mei's body also contains substances similar to chlorophyll, so she can also survive without eating.

### Northeast "Overlord" Xu Kai Arrested

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] Xu Kai, one of the "Four Overlords" who took advantage of the remaining power of the Japanese three years ago, acted perversely in the Northeast, and sold out compatriots, was arrested here on the 10th. The traitor Xu was nicknamed "Central Overlord" during the enemy puppet period and was a key member of the special service organization hosted by General Iso Kuniaki, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army. After the victory, he temporarily disappeared and then appeared as a giant businessman, manipulating food prices and monopolizing the market. Last autumn, he was appointed as the director of the Food Factory of the Changchun Branch of the Northeast Production Administration. He was recently accused of corruption. After a preliminary interrogation, he confessed his actions and identity during the enemy puppet period. According to an investigation by the security organs, during his tenure as the director of the Food Factory, the traitor Xu embezzled more than 10 billion in流通券. Once the security organs complete the interrogation of the case, it will be sent to the garrison command for legal action.

### Shandong Youth Enlist Actively, Female Students Do Not Give Way to Men

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 10th] The Youth Training Corps established by Wang Yaowu to strengthen the combat system and cultivate grassroots cadres for suppression work recently had students from Taian Middle School, Taian Normal School, and Taian Weiying Middle School participate collectively. At the same time, female students are also enthusiastically registering. Among the more than 1,000 people who have already registered (group registrations are not included), female students account for one-tenth. Zhang Shuhang, the director of education of the corps, believes that since young women are determined to love the country and do not give way to men, he has decided to cancel the original quota of 100 and recruit as many as possible to open a new era for women to join the army collectively.

### Kaohsiung and Keelung to Open Free Ports, Currently Not Yet in Concrete Stage

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 10th] The Kaohsiung and Keelung port authorities have been ordered to collect relevant information and plans for the opening of free ports. The reporter visited Secretary-General Xie and Director of Transportation Chen Qingwen today and was told that Chairman Wei hopes to prosper Taiwan, so he has this proposal. However, although the current port facilities are quite suitable, the problems of its own power industry and storage warehouses must be planned in advance. Therefore, this proposal is still far from the concrete stage.

[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 10th] People here are generally very interested in the opening of free ports in Taiwan, believing that it can at least save the current bad phenomenon of domestic capital flowing to Hong Kong and promote the prosperity of Taiwan's industry and commerce.

### Parliament to Debate West German Agreement Today - French Government Faces New Crisis - Foreign Affairs Committee Approves Agreement with Conditions

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The French National Assembly will debate the six-nation agreement on Germany tomorrow. Some quarters predict the vote may lead to the resignation of Schuman and others.

[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] The French National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee approved the six-nation agreement on West Germany today by a vote of 22 to 21, but with a reservation restricting Germany from forming a strong, centralized government. It will be submitted to the full Assembly for discussion on Friday.

[Reuters, Paris, 9th] The National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee recently approved the London Six-Nation Conference agreement by a vote of 21 to 20. Prior to the approval, Foreign Minister Bidault was questioned by the committee members for three hours. Those voting in favor were eleven members of the Popular Republican Movement, seven Socialists, two Radicals, and one Moderate. Those voting against were thirteen Communists, seven right-wing Gaullists, and unaffiliated members.

[United Press, Paris, 9th] French Foreign Minister Bidault told the Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee on the 9th that the London six-nation agreement on Germany is only a proposal, not a treaty. The proposal can be modified, but that depends on how it is implemented. Bidault emphasized that the Western countries have made significant concessions to France, especially regarding international control of the Ruhr area, the establishment of a German federal government, French participation in military occupation until peace is achieved in Europe, and permanent occupation of important areas. He also told the committee that he has a "complete understanding" of this agreement, which is impeccable.

### De Gaulle Seeks to Make a Comeback - Emphasizes that the London Conference is the Source of Trouble - Advocates Reopening Negotiations on the German Question

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] De Gaulle has called on the French people not to "surrender" to the London agreement on Germany. He said that France cannot and should not accept the decisions of the London Conference. After establishing a new German government with Frankfurt as its capital, the Soviet Union will inevitably support another government with Berlin or Leipzig as its capital. With the backing of both sides, the confrontation between these two governments, even if it does not lead to war, will inevitably promote the resurgence of a totalitarian Germany centered on Prussia. "At that time, Britain and the United States may once again adopt a policy of appeasement, and France will be sacrificed." De Gaulle emphasized that the London agreement forces France to accept absurd and indefensible measures, which pose an extreme danger to France, Europe, and the entire peace.

De Gaulle reiterated that from 1940 until his resignation in 1946, his policy was to demand the destruction of the German Empire and the establishment of an independent and peaceful German federal government. However, the French government's diplomacy has retreated step by step, leading to the final "surrender" at the London Conference. In conclusion, De Gaulle called for the reopening of negotiations on Germany and the reorganization of the current French government. He openly requested to join the cabinet, stating that in this critical moment, he is willing to directly take on the necessary responsibilities.

### West German Monetary Reform - May Be Implemented This Month

[United Press, Frankfurt, 10th] German authorities revealed that the Western Allies will fulfill their promise within this month to implement monetary reform in West Germany to replace the Mark, which has become worthless paper. This is the most active policy for West Germany's economic recovery after the war. It is generally hoped that the new currency can bring a miracle to Germany's economy, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. After the news of the monetary reform spread, the black market here has reacted immediately. Merchants are scrambling to hoard goods, and prices are soaring because no one wants to keep cash before the reform.

### U.S. House Investigates - Policy on Exports to Eastern Europe

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] The House Foreign Trade Committee has begun investigating the Commerce Department's export policy toward the Soviet Union and its vassal states.

Truman assured that his government will continue to serve the common people, not the wealthy class.

### U.S. Army Department Drafts - Far East Reconstruction Plan

Requests for Funding to Be Restored

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] The U.S. Army Department asked the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 8th to approve $150 million for the reconstruction of Japan, Korea, and the Ryukyu Islands. The House has approved $1.25 billion for the occupied areas, but the Army's requested $150 million was not included. Army Undersecretary Draper declared to the committee that the Army Department and MacArthur's staff have drafted a Far East reconstruction plan to relieve the United States of its relief obligations. Draper strongly advocated that the Senate restore the $150 million appropriation. If it is decided to take it from the total amount, it should be designated for the Army's use. In the Army Department's intentions, there is actually a $1.22 billion reconstruction plan, which was drafted before the House of Representatives deleted this item. Among them, $144 million will be used for Japan. If Congress limits the $150 million, then Japan will receive $99.2 million and South Korea will receive $60.2 million. The main raw materials supplied to the three occupied areas are wool, chemicals, fertilizer, and kerosene. The Army Department hopes that Japan will be self-sufficient by 1953.

### British King's 52nd Birthday - Celebrities Receive Medals and Titles

Son-in-Law Appointed as the King's Personal Aide-de-Camp

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] Today, as this place celebrates the King's 52nd birthday, the government announced an honors list, announcing that hundreds of celebrities from all walks of life in Britain have received titles and medals.

### Portion of Foreign Aid Fund Being Reduced - U.S. Senate Will Restore It - And Opposes Extending the Time for Its Use

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The foreign aid funds that were cut are obviously going to be restored, at least in part, by the Senate. Senator Taft stated on the 9th that he is willing to restore the foreign aid funds cut by the House. Taft has been silent on this hotly debated issue. He exceptionally told reporters that he would follow the Senate Appropriations Committee's recommendation, and people on the committee said that the committee would urge the restoration of most of the $2.16 billion in foreign aid funds cut by the House.

Almost all of the Republican presidential candidates have expressed their positions. California Governor Warren, New York Governor Dewey, and Stetson have all supported Vandenberg's efforts to restore the foreign aid funds. On the other hand, House Speaker Martin supports the House's cuts. According to sources on the Senate Appropriations Committee, the committee members will push to overturn the House's plan to use the funds over 15 months.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall strongly stated at a routine press conference on the 9th that the 5.3 billion yuan in European aid funds in the first year is the minimum cost required to implement the European Recovery Program. The reputation of the United States depends on the outcome of this Marshall Plan funding dispute. If the reduction becomes a reality, the success of the entire plan will be threatened.

### American Financial Experts - Doubt American Aid Capability

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] Democratic Congressman and financial expert Paul revealed today that the United States' funding of the European Recovery Program will put the United States in debt. Paul said that for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1949, the United States Treasury is expected to receive about 40 billion yuan, and expenditures will be 47.5 billion yuan. The deficit will be about 7.5 billion yuan. Foreign aid expenses for the same year are about 7.8 billion yuan, which is close to the monthly deficit. Paul voted against the Marshall Plan. According to him, "I don't believe that the United States can maintain its private enterprise economy and establish a strong military defense while also providing economic assistance to the sixteen countries in Europe. If the United States' financial stability is weakened, the entire civilized world will collapse. We are rapidly approaching a crisis in federal spending. We have undertaken various obligations that are enough to destroy our free enterprise system. The U.S. government spends about 65 billion yuan each year, accounting for more than 30% of the gross national income, which makes it difficult to maintain the private enterprise system. The most sacred obligation of every American people's representative is to maintain the soundness and consolidation of the United States."

### From the North Sea to the Mediterranean - Plan to Build a Highway Network - Another Step to Break Down European Economic Barriers

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] The Department of Defense announced today that a highway network plan between the North Sea and the Mediterranean involving eight countries will assist tourist travel and freight transportation and strive to simplify border crossing procedures as a step to break down European economic barriers. The route is specified by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and includes the existing highway networks of Germany and Italy. The standards and signs are generally uniform. The eight countries involved are Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the British and American occupied zones in Germany. Branch lines will extend to Berlin, Vienna, Warsaw, and Budapest, the capitals of the Eastern European countries controlled by the Soviet Union.

### Lovers Finally Become Husband and Wife - Anne Mitchell Gets Married

[United Press, Athens, 10th] Lawson King Mitchell and Princess Anne of Denmark held a grand wedding ceremony at the Greek Royal Palace at 11 a.m. this morning, bringing a perfect end to their seven-month romance. They began their lovers-finally-become-husband-and-wife romance last November when they met at the wedding of British Crown Princess Elizabeth. Those attending today's wedding included King Paul and Queen of Greece, the Greek royal family, Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis and Foreign Minister Tsaldaris and their spouses, and other senior Greek officials, Archbishop Damaskinos, Danish Prince Erik, and Mitchell's mother, Queen Mary, and others. The newlyweds plan to go to Tatoi for their honeymoon, which is a summer palace in Greece, located seventeen miles north of Athens.

### Soviet Union Prepares - To Increase Economic Aid to Friendly Countries - Striving to Exceed the United States in Production

[Associated Press, Moscow, 9th] Moscow newspapers announced today that the Soviet Union is prepared to increase economic aid to friendly countries. The government organ Izvestia and the Communist Party organ Pravda both published this matter in editorials, and praised the Soviet Union's reduction of compensation by 50% for Finland, Romania, and Hungary.

Izvestia stated: The Soviet Union is now catching up with the United States in per capita production and hopes to surpass the United States. The success of the post-war five-year plan has made the Soviet Union economically stronger than it was three or four years ago when the armistice and compensation agreements were signed. In the post-war world, countries with strong economies all think of taking advantage of the economically weak countries in Europe after the war and later forcing them to implement their policies, making small countries subordinate to the narrow and selfish interests of large countries. There are many examples of this, which are well known. These large countries spare no effort to use economic aid to achieve their goals. After examination, it is a trick to deceive people and put independent countries under their political and economic influence. The main purpose of this assistance is to form military and political blocs and cause international hatred. All of this is commonly seen by the world. The Soviet Union's economic assistance is different. The purpose is to enhance the independent status of small countries and establish democratic international cooperation, thereby making a valuable contribution to consolidating world friendship and international security. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's friendly actions towards the small countries in Europe are another blow to war profiteers, and it can cause a good reaction for those who pay attention to the establishment of democratic republics.

### For the Sake of the Survival of World Civilization - Should Defeat Communism - Smuts' Speech Emphasized This Point

[Reuters, Cambridge, 10th] Former South African Prime Minister Smuts delivered a speech today when he took office as the provost of Cambridge University, expressing that communism must be eliminated on Earth, otherwise civilization will be in danger. Communism is mankind's greatest enemy. If communism is discussed as an ideology, it has already died, but if it is discussed as a plan, it still survives. For the sake of the survival of world civilization, there is no other way to go but to defeat communism. Smuts pointed out that today's world situation is full of special dangers, but most people are not aware that they are experiencing a century-long revolution in history. Far-reaching forces will completely change the form of the world. All the major powers in the world are unwilling to avoid war, and none of the powers can have another Great Weaver. Everyone knows that the forces of war that will be mobilized by any party will make the war that occurs again an absolutely crazy war.

### Regarding the Ceasefire Proposal - The Jewish Side Has Reservations

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 10th] Judging from the remarks made by Jewish officials and civilians, Israel's unconditional acceptance of Bernadotte's ceasefire proposal is implicitly reserved. Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok recently told reporters that the Jewish state will maintain "safe passage to" Jerusalem and must not have any restrictions. He also said that the Israeli government "assumes" that Bernadotte will ban the Arab blockade of Jerusalem as an act of war. Shertok continued: "We have never agreed and will never agree to the internationalization of the entire Jerusalem, including the new urban areas. We have never agreed and will never agree that Jerusalem will belong to the Arabs." The general opinion of ordinary Jews is that the ceasefire agreement is "made in Britain," and they generally suspect Bernadotte's neutrality. Bey goes to Cairo to talk with the Arabs, but Shertok must go to Haifa to consult with the members, so the Jews also express dissatisfaction.

### Jewish Underground Army Broadcast - Opposes Unconditional Ceasefire

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 10th] The Jewish Underground Army broadcast yesterday that it was attacking the Israeli government for accepting the ceasefire proposal unconditionally, and accused UN mediator Bernadotte for being a servant of Britain. It is said that it was a serious mistake for the Israeli government not to demand that the Arab aggressors withdraw from Palestine. The government's acceptance of immigration restrictions is also very unwise. Implementing a ceasefire under these conditions will harm Israel's political and military position. Although the British-participated control is effective for Jews, it will not be effective for Arabs.

### Palestinian Peace Conference - Will Be Held on the Island of Rhodes - The United Nations Has High Hopes for Bernadotte

[Our Dispatch] New York, 10th Broadcast: Cairo News, UN mediator Bernadotte urged the Jewish and Arab governments to allow him to use all means of transportation and ordered the public to comply with the ceasefire agreement. In addition, on the Security Council, Soviet representative Gromyko will raise the issue of the international investigation team again, advocating that Soviet military observers participate in it. According to Bernadotte's current actions, it seems that there is no intention to invite the Soviet side to participate.

[Reuters, Cairo, 9th] Both the Jewish and Arab sides unconditionally accepted the UN mediator Bernadotte's ceasefire terms today, agreeing to a ceasefire starting at 10 a.m. Palestine time on June 11. Bernadotte then announced that he would convene a peace conference of Jewish and Arab representatives on the island of Rhodes in the Aegean Sea during the four-week ceasefire period.

Bernadotte stated that the unconditional acceptance of the ceasefire by the Jewish and Arab sides is only the first step, and in the future, the same efforts should be made to achieve the final goal of peace in Palestine. Bernadotte will first go to Amman and then to Rhodes, where he will set up his general base for resolving the Palestine issue.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] UN Secretary-General Lie announced today that the UN Palestine mediator Bernadotte will have 63 military advisors from several nationalities to assist him in monitoring the implementation of the ceasefire. Bernadotte also plans to obtain six coastal patrol boats from France, the United States, and Belgium. Bernadotte also suggested that each ceasefire supervision team be commanded by five senior Swedish officers.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 9th] The United Nations, rejoicing over the hard-won ceasefire in Palestine, concentrated its hopes for permanent peace in the Holy Land on Bernadotte on the 9th. According to disclosures from British and American officials, both Britain and the United States are trying to give Bernadotte full power to negotiate a permanent solution with the Arab and Jewish sides on his own. The British and American representatives will recommend to the Security Council that a "hands-off" policy be adopted until it becomes clear whether Bernadotte can succeed again.

### Japanese Purge Work - Has Come to an End

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] According to diplomatic sources, the Japanese government's purge work has long come to an end. The number of people purged to date is 199,202, including special police and military personnel.

All purged personnel may appeal to the Public Office Eligibility Review Committee for review to lift the purge. According to the Japanese government's announcement on May 22, 143 people have been released from the purge through this procedure, including former State Ministers Hashido and Otobori, and Maosheng. However, those who have been re-tried and are still determined to be purged include former Finance Minister Ishibashi, Zhan Shan, and Inukai Ken. The re-trial work has come to an end.

### Meeting of Chinese and Japanese Delegations at the Moral Re-Armament Assembly

[Special Dispatch from Riverside, California by the Central News Agency, 9th] Representatives from China and Japan attending the 10th World Assembly of Moral Re-Armament met today in the Oriental Representatives' Room of the hotel where they were staying. The Chinese delegation was led by Mr. Chen Lifu, and the Japanese delegation was led by former Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Kensuke Horiuchi. They engaged in an informal conversation for about an hour. During the exchange of views, Mr. Chen cited Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speech during his last visit to Japan and President Chiang's radio address to Japan after the victory.

### Research on Tuberculosis Bacteria: Disrupting Cell Function Opens New Avenues for Treating TB

[Dispatch from Palo Alto, California by the Associated Press, 10th] According to Dr. Fair, a bacteriologist at Stanford University, the insidious ways in which tuberculosis bacteria destroy body cells have been discovered. This medical breakthrough may open new avenues for combating TB and for finding new treatments for allergic reactions caused by poison ivy and rubber. Dr. Lai claims that the destructive element of the tuberculosis bacteria is a waxy substance composed of starch and fatty acids. Although the actual destructive agent is bacterial protein, it cannot destroy body cells without the lipids. This waxy substance softens body cells, making them more vulnerable to bacterial protein attacks. Dr. Lai's discovery raises the question of whether new methods of combating TB can be derived from finding a way to remove the waxy portion of the tuberculosis bacteria.

### New Consul in Marseilles Takes Office

Special Correspondent's dispatch from Paris, 19th: The newly appointed Consul to Marseilles, along with his wife, son, and daughter, arrived in Marseilles today to take office.

### Soviet Reconstruction of Murmansk Port: Transforming it into a Strong Naval Base in the Far North

[Dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden by the United Press, 9th] According to newspapers here, the Soviet Union is rebuilding the port of Murmansk, making it a Soviet naval base, potentially the northernmost naval port in Europe. The newspaper quoted Moscow newspapers as saying that military equipment from German naval ports has been transported to Murmansk. It is claimed that the Soviet reconstruction of the port is part of the Soviet plan to open up the Arctic sea route, so that ships can travel from Murmansk via the Arctic to the Chukchi Peninsula, opposite the White Sea Strait. The peninsula is said to contain extremely rich deposits of gold, silver, lead, and zinc.

### City Government Dissatisfied with Jiaotong University's Response: Second Letter Inquiring About Parade Incident; Mayor Wu Clarifies Stance on Student Protests to Reporters

[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the "Oppose America Supporting Japan" parade held by Jiaotong University students on the 5th of this month, the city government authorities sent a letter to Jiaotong University with seven questions. After Mayor Wu urged for a response for three days, the Jiaotong University authorities sent a reply letter to the city government yesterday. The city government considers the answers unsatisfactory and has issued a second official letter yesterday (attached below), asking for a public response. If they fail to comply, legal steps will be taken and they will be summoned for questioning. To demonstrate the city government's open and aboveboard attitude, reporters will be invited to attend the questioning in the future.

Mayor Wu also held a reception for reporters at the city government at 5 p.m. yesterday, repeatedly clarifying that the student parade was undoubtedly manipulated by communist bandits. "Patriotism" is just a name, while the true intention is conspiracy. If the so-called student movement was indeed organized by the students themselves, the city government would sympathize with them. However, now that it has been confirmed that there are people manipulating it behind the scenes, they will be severely punished. Mayor Wu also listed four points regarding the municipal government's attitude towards the current student protests: (1) advocating democracy but opposing hijacking and deceiving the public; (2) advocating freedom but not advocating violating school rules and laws; (3) sympathizing with patriotism but not sympathizing with disrupting social order under false pretenses; and (4) advocating openness and opposing ambiguity.

Mayor Wu concluded by reading a letter from a patriotic Jiaotong University student. The student did not sign his name, claiming to be afraid of being attacked by communist professional students. The letter criticized the communist students, revealing that the school's student union was not made up of free and neutral elements but was completely controlled by the Communist Party. The student also said that during the evening gatherings, their slogans and performances were very sorrowful, but their emotions were extremely happy. The student said, "This inherent contradiction is inexplicable." Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy for the patriotic student and stated that communist students would be severely punished.

Eight Questions from the City Government

The following is an excerpt of the city government's second letter to Jiaotong University: (1) Who convened the "Shanghai 120 School Joint May Fourth Bonfire Party"? Did the participants (who claimed to be representatives of each school) obtain the consent of all the students in the schools they represented beforehand? (2) What is the structure of the "Shanghai United Association Against American Support for Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis"? Who are the organizers, and how were they selected? (This point should pay attention to whether its generation is democratic.) (3) The answer states, "The association decided at the May 22nd Memorial Meeting to take active action and set a date for the parade. However, participation was up to each school." According to the city government's investigation, there was no such decision at the so-called May 20th Memorial Meeting. (This point should be noted by the students from each school who attended the meeting: if there was no such decision at the meeting, then they are not only intentionally deceiving the students who did not attend, but also intentionally deceiving the students who did attend.) Since the school's student union has responded that such a decision was made at the meeting, please investigate who chaired the meeting at the time, who proposed the motion, how it was voted on, and whether it was clearly decided at that time to gather and demonstrate on the Bund on the afternoon of June 5th. (4) If the resolution was not established at the so-called May 20th Memorial Meeting, please inquire when and by whom the resolution was made in the name of the association. Who were the Jiaotong University student representatives who participated in this resolution or were notified of this resolution? (5) Since the answer admits that the Jiaotong University student representatives "have had close contact with the anti-American support for Japan committees of other schools," please inquire, whether participating "through the student union" or participating under other names, how many times did they participate, when and where, who were the representatives of the so-called "anti-American support for Japan committees of other schools," who were the Jiaotong University representatives, and what were the matters of contact? (6) Has the school's student union publicly reported the resolution on the parade and the date of the parade from the May 20th Memorial Meeting and the contact between Jiaotong University and the "anti-American support for Japan committees of other schools" to all students between the May 22nd resolution and the June 4th department representative conference? If so, when? If not, why not? (7) The list of 120 schools has already been submitted by the student union. Please forward it, and please inquire again, even if "only a small number of students participated and cannot represent the entire school," who are the representatives or contact persons of each school? (8) It is reported that there are more than 200 department representatives at Jiaotong University, but only more than 30 people voted in favor of the parade. Please inquire about the voting situation and why this absolute minority could hijack the majority.

### Foreign Exchange Settlement Issues for Public Utilities: Yu Hongjun's Four-Point Reply; Branch Issues to be Discussed After Returning to Shanghai

[Dispatch from Nanjing by our Newspaper, 10th] Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun, who came to Nanjing to discuss important matters, returned to Shanghai by night train on the 10th. Regarding the issue of foreign exchange settlement for public utilities in Shanghai, Mr. Yu was ordered to announce his solution to the eight senators at the Central Bank in Nanjing at 10:30 a.m. on the 10th, which is still a compromise. Regarding the four requests made by the Shanghai Municipal Council, Yu's response is as follows: (1) On the issue of public utilities settling all foreign exchange at the official exchange rate, Yu replied that if all foreign exchange were settled at the official rate, it would be equivalent to subsidizing public utilities, which not only the government's finances could not afford but also would not help stabilize prices. However, for the oil portion of public utilities, the export exchange settlement certificate method is allowed, and public utility companies are allowed to pay the official rate first when settling the price. The difference can be temporarily advanced by the Central Bank and repaid in three months. The Central Bank will consider the foreign exchange required for public utilities other than oil. (2) It is practically difficult to settle foreign exchange three months in advance. However, the oil portion can be settled once a month in the future. (3) In principle, the issue of pre-storing three months' worth of safe coal can be agreed to, and the required funds can be loaned. However, approximately 20,000 tons of coal are required per month, which is too large. The detailed method must be negotiated after returning to Shanghai. The price of coal in June will also be discussed after returning to Shanghai. (4) The issue of calculating import tariffs at the official exchange rate falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and must be discussed with the Ministry of Finance before a decision can be made. Several other branch issues will continue to be discussed with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Council after arriving in Shanghai.

### Dragon Boat Race Rehearsal: Each Shows Skills; Drums and Firecrackers Cheer From the Banks

[Report from our Newspaper] The dragon boat race rehearsal took place fiercely on the Huangpu River yesterday. Ten dragons and one phoenix crisscrossed. Despite the turbulent waves, each boat still moved forward and backward in an orderly manner with agile and coordinated movements. Spectators gathered on both sides of the river, setting off firecrackers from time to time. Each boat gathered upon hearing the sound, and the oars moved as if crossbow arrows were leaving the bowstring. Cheers rose and fell. The boat bodies were different colors, colorful and spectacular.

### Transporting Materials to Communist Areas: Eight Criminals Arrested in Shanghai One After Another

[Report from our Newspaper] Wang Weizhou, head of the Yangshupu Police Branch, received a confidential report on the 8th that suspected financiers of the communists were hiding at No. 710 Huoshan Road.

[Report from our Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office attached great importance to the Zhongfa Warehouse fire on Henan Road. Although the police bureau in the jurisdiction had not yet transferred the investigation report to the office, Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang has appointed Prosecutor Ding Chuanen to be responsible for the investigation.

Police Bureau Chief Yu issued a general order to all branch bureaus yesterday, stating that warehouses and depots in this city often store dangerous goods without permits, which greatly affects the safety of citizens. He specially ordered them to conduct inspections together with the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau according to the Regulations on the Management of Dangerous Goods Transportation and the Regulations on the Management of Flammable Liquids such as Nitric Acid Fiber. If there is any situation where dangerous goods are stored without a permit, they should be banned immediately and ordered to be moved to the suburbs.

### Lumber Sheds on the Beach at the Water Plant's Intake to be Ordered to Relocate

[Report from our Newspaper] The Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Council inspected the French Tram and Electric Light Company (water and electricity sections), the Mainland Water Plant, and the Chinese Electric Company yesterday.

### Case of Manager of Guiyuan Shop Stabbed to Death: Two Murderers Arrested in Nanjing; Police Bureau Completes Investigation and Transfers Case to District Prosecutor's Office This Morning

[Report from our Newspaper] On the 29th of last month, Dai Shaonong, the manager of Dafeng Guiyuan Shop on Minguo Road, was stabbed to death by barber Yang Wenfu and pancake vendor Huan Qing with sharp blades due to a feud caused by the dismantling of the shed during the renovation of the shop's facade. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. After the incident, the Yimiao Police Branch once summoned Li Xuezhong, who set up a noodle stall, to inquire about the whereabouts of the two, but to no avail. They later learned that Yang's parents, wife, and children all lived at No. 149 Yangjiazhai in Pudong. They sent the police to the address, but they had already fled. Only his sister and wife were arrested. According to their confessions, Yang had a relative named Zhou Zhaoxuan, who was a police chief at the Wuxian Police Bureau. Section Chief Zhou Nan personally led Soviet Section Chief Su Tao, Police Chief Cui Jinchuan, and officers Jiang Yunshu, Hong Cheng, Wang Shilian, Ju Bin, and Gu Zhicheng to Suzhou by night train on the 4th. Zhou had been transferred to the Binlin Temple Police Station, so they rushed to the station to meet Zhou. Yang Wenfu's brother, Wencai, was also present, and he was immediately arrested. He confessed that the murderers, Yang Wenfu, etc., had come to Suzhou and had now disappeared. They may have gone to Hao Mingzhi, a relative of his wife, outside Fengmen, Xiaomituo (Hao is the first platoon leader of the first company of the first brigade of the Wuxian Regiment Management District). They immediately tracked them down and learned that Hao's wife, Zhou Quanzhen, had taken the two criminals to Huqiu. They searched from house to house in the Huqiu area with the police and only found Hao Zhou Quanzhen. According to her confession, Yang and others had probably gone to Zhenjiang or Taizhou. Because Yang had no national identity card, it was not easy to live outside the district, so he had to ask a friend surnamed Deng to ask Gao Erye, the police chief of Yangzhou, to fill in a paper for him. Section Chief Zhou, with this clue, ordered a part of the police to wait by the river in Zhenjiang. On the one hand, he took Hao Zhou Quanzhen and Yang Wencai back to Shanghai for questioning. Then, he sent the police to Yang's house in Pudong and found a letter with the address of Yu Wencai, a relative of Yang Wencai, at the Li Xiangtai firewood shop outside Nanjing South Gate. Section Chief Zhou then asked Yang's parents to write a letter and sent Yang Wencai to Nanjing to find Yu Wencai. After meeting him, he frankly said that Yang Wenfu and others had been accompanied by his brother Wenbiao to drink tea at Fuzimiao in the morning, and they had an appointment to watch a play at the Fuqin Jianghuai Theatre in the afternoon. The police officers then went to the theater at about 4 p.m. on the 8th and captured the two criminals. They confessed to stabbing Dai Shaonong to death with a knife. The interrogation has now been completed and the case will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation this morning.

### Wage Disputes: Huizhong Tobacco Factory Slows Down Work

[Report from our Newspaper] More than 400 workers at the Huizhong Tobacco Factory slowed down work yesterday morning. The reason is that the labor and capital parties of the factory agreed on a conciliation record in February of this year, stipulating that those with a base salary of less than 20 yuan would not be discounted and would be paid in full according to the monthly cost of living index, while those with a base salary of more than 20 yuan would be paid at a 90% discount according to the monthly index. This was implemented for March and April. At the end of April, the capital side requested the Social Bureau to issue wages at a 75% discount because the expenses were huge and unbearable. The labor side refused to accept it, and the two sides argued. The Social Bureau mediated once on the 4th of this month and instructed the capital side to continue to pay wages according to the original method on the 5th of this month before the dispute was resolved. However, the capital side did not pay wages until the 8th, and the workers were dissatisfied, so they slowed down work. The Social Bureau is still trying to mediate.

### 淪陷夫人慘死　漕河涇女屍案大白　退伍軍人重婚起毒心　警員三度赴京獲兇犯
The tragic death of a "fallen" woman: The case of the female corpse in Caohejing is solved. A retired soldier commits bigamy and plans a murderous plot. Police officers travel to Beijing three times to apprehend the murderer.

〔本報訊〕
During the War of Resistance, countless stories of joy and sorrow occurred within families, which has been frequently seen. Unexpectedly, recently in this city, an even more cruel tragedy occurred: a "fallen" woman was stabbed more than twenty times and died. The murderer was apprehended in Beijing on the 5th of this month and brought back to Shanghai for interrogation. The process of the murder and the solving of the case is truly heartbreaking and full of twists and turns.

The male protagonist of this tragedy, named Chen Xiwu, is a soldier not in active service and studied military science in the United States. The motive for this tragic incident seems to have been to please the "fallen" woman. Chen lied that the "fallen" woman had already passed away before he committed bigamy, but fearing that this would be exposed over time, he cruelly took her life, hoping to solve the problem once and for all.

The most unfortunate female protagonist, the "fallen" woman Lin Xinying, was originally from Meixian, Guangdong Province, and a fellow villager of Chen. During the War of Resistance, she wandered to Jiangxi, enduring countless hardships. Unexpectedly, with the arrival of victory, she met an unprincipled man and was killed. This is truly a great tragedy in the world.

Before the murder occurred, the murderer resided in Suzhou, while the "fallen" woman was in Jiaxing. However, the location of the murder was in the suburbs of Shanghai, and the murderer was arrested in Nanjing. The process is full of twists and turns.

Looking back, the discovery of Lin Xinying's murder was as early as the 17th of last month. Initially, the Detective Section of the Shanghai Police Bureau received a report from the Longhua Branch that a female corpse was found next to a small river on the west side of Zhongjia Tomb in Dong Caohejing. The entire body had been stabbed more than twenty times.

### 貼身搜出血箋
A blood-stained letter was found hidden on her person.

After investigation by the police, the deceased was approximately twenty-five years old, wearing a dark blue cheongsam and yellow leather shoes. A handkerchief, rouge, and lipstick were found next to the body. Finally, in the pocket of her underwear, a blood-stained letter written with a fountain pen was found. After careful identification, it was only discovered that one line read: "My sister can often go to Huang Duohua at the Budget Office of the Automobile Maintenance Regiment of the Nanjing Logistics Headquarters." Upon obtaining this clue, the police immediately dispatched the original investigators to Beijing to inquire at the aforementioned address. As a result, Lin Xinyun, the wife of Huang, was found in Chuanhougang. After the police showed her a photo of the deceased and the blood-stained letter, Lin was greatly shocked and stated that the letter was sent by her cousin, Lin Xinzou, and the photo was of her cousin, Lin Xinying. On May 13th, she received a letter from the deceased sent from the Yingbin Hotel on Dongmen Street in Jiaxing, but knew nothing else. The police then went to Jiaxing to investigate at the address provided by Lin. In the hotel's registry, it was found that a man named Chen Shuchuan, who worked in the 11th Team of the Traffic Police Brigade as a specialist, had stayed at the hotel with the deceased since April 16th and left on May 16th. It was also learned that a man in military uniform had visited the hotel several times to meet with the deceased, and an argument had once occurred. The police went to the Traffic Police Brigade to find Chen and interrogated him.

He replied that the deceased, Lin Xinying, was his sister-in-law, and the man in military uniform was Chen's older brother, Chen Xiwu, who currently resided at No. 18, Five Lane in Nanjing, at the home of Shi Jinmin. Upon receiving the report, the police went to Nanjing for the second time to investigate at the aforementioned address, but found nothing. At that time, the police believed that Chen Shuchuan had provided a false address and was heavily suspected, so they returned to Jiaxing and questioned Chen sternly. Chen then confessed that his brother lived at No. 23 and a half, Lutoutang, outside the Suzhou gate. When the police went to investigate at that location in Suzhou, they were disappointed again. However, Chen Xiwu had indeed resided there once, but had now moved out.

### 發現抗戰夫人
The "fallen" woman was discovered.

The police then joined forces with the local criminal police team to investigate and learned that Chen had moved to No. 12, Dabei'an Road, Qiaowan. They went to the address, intending to break down the door, when suddenly a modern woman with a Hangzhou accent, claiming to be Chen Xiwu's wife, appeared. At this point, the police realized that Chen had two wives and that the case might involve a love triangle. They immediately changed their attitude, pretending to be close friends of Chen Xiwu who had come to visit on important business. After talking with her, it was learned that this Mrs. Chen was named Zhou Liwen, the sister-in-law of Wang Jun, who had served as the Deputy Minister of the Military Affairs Department and was currently a legislator. She married Chen in Pixian, Sichuan, in April of the 34th year of the Republic before the victory, and had children, one of whom had died young. Her daughter, Zhenzhen, was only one year old. However, the police suddenly noticed a boy of about five years old on another small bed and asked Chen's wife about him. She replied that he was Chen's nephew who had recently come to live there. Finally, Chen's wife told the police that if they urgently wanted to visit Chen, they could inquire at No. 3, Yinyangying, Hankou Road in Nanjing or at Liao Zhonghuang's office in the Central Bank. Upon obtaining this important clue, the police went to Beijing for the third time, hurrying to the aforementioned locations. However, due to slight differences in timing, they ultimately failed to meet Chen.

### 見照面色慘變
His face turned pale upon seeing the photo.

They then established close contact with the capital police and continued to investigate Chen's whereabouts, finally apprehending Chen at No. 23, Liyuan, Nanchang Road on the afternoon of June 5th. Initially, Chen stubbornly denied everything. However, when the photo of the deceased was shown to him, Chen's face turned pale, and he lowered his head in silence. The police then escorted him to Shanghai. After several days of tireless interrogation by the police bureau, the truth finally came to light.

According to Chen Xiwu's confession, he married the deceased, Lin Xinying, in his hometown of Guangdong in the winter of the 28th year of the Republic. They had children, a daughter named Ganqiu, who was seven years old and currently lived with Chen's older brother, Fuxiang, at No. 25, Chengdongjiao Road in Ganxian, Jiangxi. Their younger son, Xiangchun, was five years old and had accompanied the deceased from Ganxian to Jiaxing to visit his uncle, Chen Shuchuan, to inquire about his news. After receiving a letter from his younger brother, Chen was extremely anxious because he had lied that his wife had died when he married Zhou Liwen. He feared that if Zhou found out, the consequences would be disastrous. Therefore, he hurried to Jiaxing, intending to discuss the matter with the deceased, which led to an argument. However, the deceased recounted her hardships in raising their children during the War of Resistance, which made Chen feel extremely remorseful. Therefore, he traveled between Suzhou and Jiaxing several times and gave the deceased a total of seven million yuan in living expenses in two installments.

### 僅聞慘呼救命
Only a tragic cry for help was heard.

Unexpectedly, at this difficult juncture, he consulted Tan Yumin, the squad leader of the 5th Traffic Police Brigade. Tan then expressed his willingness to find a solution. On May 16th, after making arrangements, Chen lied to the deceased that they were going to Shanghai together to buy clothing. When the car arrived at the Xinlonghua Station, he tricked her into getting out. Tan then secretly followed behind. After walking about a mile north from the station, Tan unexpectedly stabbed the deceased in the back with a sharp blade in a deserted place. Chen only heard the deceased cry out "Help!" before falling silent. Soon after, Tan urged Chen to leave quickly. Realizing that his wife had been killed, Chen suppressed his inner pain and went to Jiaxing the next day, taking his younger son, Xiangchun, who had come south with him, back to Suzhou under the guise of being his nephew for upbringing. Since then, Chen had been unable to sleep peacefully, so he left Suzhou for Beijing, unexpectedly being arrested and brought to justice. The fugitive, Tan Yumin, is currently being actively pursued by the police.

This case will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for legal proceedings within days. The officers in charge of handling this case at the police bureau are Chief of the Detective Section, He Junhou, Section Chief Zhu Mengwei, Deputy Section Chief Chen Xianrong, and Officer Wu Yaozu. They traveled back and forth between Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai, enduring countless hardships, and finally solved the case. It is said that the travel expenses alone cost approximately 100 million yuan in legal tender.

食米狂漲漫無止境　特高粳又創新高價
Rice prices soar endlessly; specially graded high-gluten rice sets a new record high.

〔本報訊〕
Rice prices continue to surge, reaching a new peak yesterday. The retail price of specially graded high-gluten rice has exceeded the 9 million mark. According to an analysis by the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau, the reasons for the rise in rice prices are: (1) Prices of all goods soared before the Dragon Boat Festival, stimulating rice prices. (2) An inevitable phenomenon under severe inflation. (3) Limited arrivals and eager buyers. (4) Rising rice prices in the producing areas.

Furthermore, after the soaring rice prices in this city, Mayor Wu consulted Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan for countermeasures.

Also, the rice market has been rising sharply without any signs of stopping, repeatedly setting new record highs. Due to the frequent price increases in Wuxi's producing areas, people are unanimously expecting further increases. Those holding goods are reluctant to sell, fearing that they will have difficulty replenishing their stocks later. Buyers are not deterred by high prices, as long as they can acquire the goods. Moreover, due to the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, rice shops are even more reluctant to sell, making the market even more bullish. White glutinous rice has reached 8.5 million, and specially graded high-gluten rice has reached 8.8 million, each rising by 500,000. In the South City market, glutinous rice has risen by 400,000 to 500,000, indica rice has increased by 300,000 to 400,000, and sticky rice has risen by 300,000. These goods are scarce.

新結匯辦法公布以後　工商輔導處發表意見　對於實施技術須加詳細研究　以達促進生產推廣輸出目的
After the announcement of the new foreign exchange settlement method, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office expresses its views. Detailed research on implementation techniques is needed to achieve the goals of promoting production and expanding exports.

The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Guidance Office recently released its views on the new foreign exchange settlement method, hoping that they will be adopted and implemented by the government authorities and relevant departments. The original views are as follows:

The recent announcement of the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement certificate method by the authorities is helpful in promoting exports and preventing the evasion of overseas remittances. All parties support the implementation of this new method, which is considered a relatively progressive measure. However, detailed research is still needed during implementation to maximize its benefits and prevent its drawbacks, in order to truly promote production and expand exports. The following points should be noted:

(1) The import permit system should still be maintained to protect domestic agricultural and industrial businesses and avoid wasting foreign exchange.

(2) If self-provided foreign exchange is fully liberalized, it may be difficult to attract overseas remittances and may stimulate foreign exchange market prices and inflation. It is not advisable to fully liberalize it before proper measures are prepared, but it may be appropriately liberalized for those that meet certain production plans and are specially approved by the highest authorities.

(3) Production equipment in Annex 1 should be allowed to be imported as much as possible to increase production and develop exports.

(4) Industrial raw materials in Annex 2, which are urgently needed for domestic industrial production and whose products can be exported, should have their quotas relaxed as much as possible.

(5) Goods in Annex 3, which are urgently needed for domestic production, education, science, and daily use, should also have their quotas relaxed to allow for import.

(6) The examination and approval of quotas should be strictly confidential and reasonable. The organizing agency should take the initiative to contact and jointly determine with the industry and commerce guidance institutions.

(7) After the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method, export conditions will definitely improve, and exporters will inevitably compete to export. The overseas market may be oversupplied, leading to a drop in market prices, which will ultimately affect exports. Therefore, the supply and demand conditions of overseas markets must be thoroughly investigated to guide exporters and prevent them from engaging in blind competition and harming themselves. It is best to unite and promote exports.

(8) Under the assistance of the new foreign exchange settlement method, exporters will strive to export in large quantities in order to earn foreign exchange differences. As a result, they may easily disregard the quality of goods, only seeking to sell them off for profit. This will greatly affect trade credit. Therefore, export inspection work must be strengthened to prevent substandard goods from being exported overseas.

(9) Exporters often do not accurately report prices to banks when settling foreign exchange, profiting from the difference. In the future, the audit of export prices must be strict, and overseas market prices should be investigated in detail and listed weekly for designated banks to refer to as the basis for foreign exchange settlement. (To be continued)

指定銀行結匯餘額　提高至五千美元　結匯證明書最高價漲至五八萬
The foreign exchange settlement balance of designated banks is raised to US$5,000. The highest price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate rises to 580,000.

Section 25 of the Measures for the Use of Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates, promulgated at the end of last month, stipulated that the balance of the foreign exchange settlement certificate account of designated banks should be limited to US$1,000. It is now learned that the Central Bank has decided to raise this balance limit to US$5,000. The Business Bureau of the Bank specifically issued Circular No. 140 to inform all designated banks yesterday.

However, although the highest transaction price reached 580,000 yuan, adding the Central Bank's listed price of 474,000, the total amount is 1,054,000 yuan. Compared with the black market, it is still one-third lower, and has not yet met general expectations.

多頭獲利吐售　棉紗布臨收回低　四二支藍鳳較上日挫一千萬
Bulls take profits and sell; cotton yarn and cloth close lower. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn is down 10 million from the previous day.

The cotton yarn market conditions yesterday were due to consecutive days of excessive gains, and the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching. Bulls took profits and sold, and the intake from outside customers turned sluggish, causing the market to decline. Finally, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn closed slightly lower at 430 million yuan, a decrease of 10 million yuan from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also decreased by 4.5 million to 8.9 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market yesterday was approaching the Dragon Boat Festival, and credit was tight on all sides. Moreover, the sale of spun goods had begun, and buyers were hesitant, resulting in very little trading in the market. In addition to some retail investors slightly covering short positions and large accounts taking the opportunity to buy, prices were pushed up to 9.4 million yuan. Near the close, credit was slightly tight among dealers, and bulls sold, but there were not many buyers. The leading cloth fell back to 9.16 million yuan at the close, a decrease of 40,000 yuan from the previous day. In addition, the prices of the Four Gentlemen and Bi Ji were varied, with sales available for spun goods, resulting in larger declines.

自費留學結匯　將照中央牌價　霍賓樹已表示意見　教部未奉政院明示
Foreign exchange settlement for self-funded study abroad will be based on the Central Bank's listed price. Huo Binshu has already expressed his opinion. The Ministry of Education has not received clear instructions from the Executive Yuan.

〔本報南京十日電〕
Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Transportation Control Committee, told reporters from Shanghai newspapers a few days ago: After the new foreign exchange settlement method is announced, foreign exchange settlement for self-funded students studying abroad cannot be based on the official price, but should be based on the Central Bank's listed price. All family members of self-funded students studying abroad in the country must settle foreign exchange at the official price of 12,000 yuan every six months for their children's self-funded study abroad. Now the listed price has risen to 474,000 yuan, and it is still being adjusted at any time, which will be unbearable for them. Many have privately inquired with the Ministry of Education. It is heard that the personnel in charge of studying abroad at the Ministry of Education specially visited the Executive Yuan to discuss this matter on the 10th. The Executive Yuan has not yet made a definite reply because it has not received a report from the Central Bank.

According to the American Presbyterian Church: Jinan Qilu University is scheduled to close before June 15, and then move in two parts. The School of Medicine will move to Fuzhou and merge with the Fuzhou Medical College. Whether it will be merged or maintain its original name has not yet been decided. The College of Science and Literature will move to Hangzhou and use Zhijiang University for teaching. Where the Theological Seminary and the Agricultural College will move has not yet been decided.

The reason for this move is that transportation in Jinan is difficult, and teachers and students will evacuate by plane.

### Liu Deming Case to be Heard Today. Identity Issue to be Determined First. Lawyer Fu Requests Transfer of Jurisdiction from the Garrison Headquarters.

Liu Deming, the president of the Army's Friend Society, was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters on the afternoon of the 9th, along with relevant agencies, on charges of impersonating a soldier, defrauding, and embezzling public funds. His various properties have been investigated separately. Except for the Army's Friend Radio Station, the small daily newspaper, and the Army's Glory Elementary School, which are allowed to maintain their current status as they are related to cultural undertakings, the Army's Friend Society and the Army's Friend Salon have been sealed. The authorities are investigating the alleged illegal acquisition of dozens of houses by Liu, which were then leased out for profit. After being arrested, Liu was detained in the Garrison Headquarters detention center and underwent a brief interrogation by the Military Law Office yesterday. The formal trial is scheduled for 9:00 AM today. According to a responsible person, today's trial will focus on determining whether Liu's identity is that of a soldier or not. If he is indeed a soldier, he will be tried by military law. If he is an impersonator, the case may be transferred to the local court.

In addition: After Liu Deming, the president of the Army's Friend Society, was arrested, his permanent legal advisor, Lawyer Fu Kuanglin, submitted a petition to the Garrison Headquarters requesting that Liu be transferred to the court on the grounds that he is not an active soldier. Military Judge Lin and Mu Yan of the Garrison Headquarters, who are handling the case, have gone to investigate and count Liu's property. The case is being reviewed and handled by the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters. Once the soldier's identity is fully confirmed, a military trial tribunal will be organized to interrogate him in accordance with military law. It is reported that the majority of Liu's property is registered under the name of his wife, Weng ____ Hua.
