### President Chiang Kai-shek Presides Over the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Announces Unwillingness to Run for President, Discussion Results Submitted to the Central Standing Committee for Study

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The Kuomintang Sixth Central Executive Committee's Provisional Plenary Session opened at 10 a.m. on the 4th. President Chiang Kai-shek presided in person. 322 executive committee members attended. The discussion topic was the nomination of presidential and vice-presidential candidates and personnel selection. After a full day of deliberation, no final conclusion was reached. It was decided to hold a second meeting on the 6th to continue the discussion and make a decision. The preliminary agreed-upon principles reached at today's meeting were: (1) Whether the presidential candidate should be nominated by the party and who the candidate should be will be submitted to the provisional Central Standing Committee for study at 3 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th and then submitted to the plenary session for discussion. (2) The vice-presidential candidate will not be nominated by the party, and a free election will be held. (3) In view of the fact that the nomination and election of presidential and vice-presidential candidates this time was too rushed, and no proper preparations could be made in advance, the next election will adopt the method of party nomination. Three months before the opening of the National Assembly, a national congress of the party will be convened to listen to the decisions of all comrades in the party regarding the candidates. Before the discussion, President Chiang gave instructions, first explaining why he had previously expressed whether or not to participate in the presidential election, because he was a party member and should respect the party's decisions and accept the party's orders. Before a decision was made, he personally could not express any opinion. Secondly, he declared that he had personally decided not to participate in the presidential election, and at the same time expressed that even if he does not serve as president in the future, he can still implement the party's policies and continue to fight against the Communist Party. He personally believes that the future president must possess the following conditions: (1) possess democratic manners, (2) have a deep understanding of Chinese history and culture, (3) be able to fully support the constitution and faithfully implement it, (4) have a deep understanding and research on international issues and the international situation, (5) be loyal to the country and have nationalistic ideals, and the president also expressed that he must not be a member of the Kuomintang. After President Chiang's instructions, Zou Lu first stood up and said that according to the current situation, the position of president must still be held by President Chiang. Committee members Pan Gongzhan, Gan Naiguang, Yu Youren, and others spoke successively, unanimously supporting President Chiang to serve as the first president. During the afternoon meeting, President Chiang once again put forward his opinions, hoping that the meeting could study them in detail. All the committee members present believed that President Chiang's attitude was sincere, and that this matter was of great importance and should not be decided rashly. It was decided to submit it to the provisional Central Standing Committee on the 5th for detailed study based on President Chiang's instructions, and then submit it to the general assembly for discussion.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] At the Kuomintang Provisional Plenary Session, during the discussion of the issue of presidential and vice-presidential candidates for this term, President Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech on the spot stating that he would not serve as a presidential candidate, and expressed his determination to shoulder the responsibility of suppressing bandits, quelling disturbances, and guaranteeing the implementation of constitutional government, and to continue to provide practical and effective service to the nation and the people.

### Securities and Futures Trading Suspended From Today, Executive Yuan Stipulates That Securities Exchange Business is Limited to Spot Transactions

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The Executive Yuan believes that in addition to the spot trading of securities, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has also opened a deferred delivery business for securities, which is a futures transaction. Buying and selling are often done by the same person, which is purely for speculative manipulation by those who buy and sell short. This is contrary to the original intention of advocating investment and assisting the establishment of exchanges for production enterprises. During the period of mobilization for suppressing disturbances, this speculative transaction is particularly harmful to the national economy and social finance. Therefore, regulations have been formulated to ban it: (1) The deferred delivery business of the Shanghai Stock Exchange will be suspended from April 5, 37. The outstanding accounts that have been made will be settled according to the original agreed date and shall not be extended again. (2) In the future, the business of the stock exchange shall be limited to spot transactions, and futures transactions shall not be conducted in any form. (3) Over-the-counter transactions shall be strictly prohibited. If brokers illegally engage in over-the-counter transactions, their licenses shall be revoked immediately and they shall be investigated according to law. (4) The supervisors stationed in the stock exchange by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall be responsible for earnestly implementing the foregoing regulations without any leniency.

### The Situation in Southern Suiyuan Gradually Becomes Tense, National Army Voluntarily Withdraws from Liangcheng and Fengzhen, Bandit Army in the Southern Section of Pingbao County Is Defeated

[Our Guihua Office, 4th] The National Army in southern Suiyuan voluntarily abandoned small points such as Tianjiazhen (old Liangcheng) last night in order to attract the bandit army to the near suburbs of Guihua, and then annihilate them by the outer troops. The main force of the bandits in southern Suiyuan is now 100 li away from Guihua. Fighting broke out 10 li south of Helin City on the morning of the 4th. Trains from Guihua to Baotou continue to run. Guihua City is already full of scenes of defending the city.

[Our Guihua Office, 4th] A spokesperson for the Guihua Command Post of the North China Suppression Headquarters stated: After being blocked in southern Chahar, the Nie Rongzhen bandit troops who committed crimes in the middle section of the Ping-Sui Railway attempted to escape the pursuit and annihilation of the national army and moved the Sixth Column westward on the 28th of last month to mix and gather with the Yao Zhe bandit troops on the border of Jin and Sui, and on the 3rd, they divided their forces from Youyu and committed crimes northward. They have engaged in fierce battles with the defending troops in Liangcheng, Tianjiazhen, and other places. In order to defend the strongholds and attract the enemy's forces, our highest military authorities have decided to withdraw from small strongholds such as Liangcheng, Tianjiazhen, and Fengzhen in advance, and thoroughly implement the policy of emptying the houses, gather the national army and militia, and defend Guihua. The defending troops and militia in Liangcheng, Tianjiazhen, Fengzhen, and other places have been ordered to begin to withdraw voluntarily, and the operation to annihilate the enemy in the near suburbs of Guihua has been deployed. The bandit army attacking Tianjiazhen is the Sixth Column. After one day and one night of fighting, the defending troops not only managed to defend the strongholds, but also sent a company of men to attack, accompanying more than 50 bandits, killing more than 400 bandits, and seizing more than 50 rifles and two light machine guns, which shows that the bandit army's morale is low and its fighting power is weak.

[Our Taiyuan Office, 3rd] A large bandit army that crossed the Ping-Sui Line and sneaked into the Fengzhen area fled westward. A brigade of bandits from Wutai also entered southern Suiyuan through Shanyin, attempting to establish a base in Sui.

[Our Beiping Office, 4th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced: Guihua is in a tight situation, and the main force of the Communist bandits is moving towards Guihua in several groups from eastern Sui and northern Jin. Tianjiazhen has been under attack since the morning of the 3rd. The national army is sweeping northward from Yangcun on the Ping-Jin Line to Hexiwu, and the national army in Miyun on the Ping-Gu Line is also sweeping southward, forming a siege of Sanhe. The Communist bandits in western Liaoning have a tendency to flee back to western Rehe.

[Our Baoding Office, 4th] Military Information: Fierce fighting in the southern section of the Ping-Bao Line. The 5th and 7th regiments of the Nie bandits' 7th Column, which committed crimes between Gucheng and Xushui on the 3rd, were ambushed by the national army in the north and south sections of the Ping-Bao Line on the 4th. In the morning, the bandits were surrounded in villages such as Baitapu and Linlindian and resisted stubbornly all day long, suffering heavy casualties. The bandits have now collapsed and withdrawn to the west side of the railway, and traffic on the Ping-Bao Line can be restored on the 5th. Furthermore, Song Kentang, deputy commander-in-chief of the North China Suppression Headquarters, flew back to Peiping by special plane on the 3rd.

[Our Beiping Office, 4th] The Ping-Bao Line is still tense. There was fighting south of Zhuoxian this morning. The Songlindian station was harassed briefly last night. The Communist bandits attacking Xiongxian suffered casualties and retreated. There were minor intrusions in Xincheng.

### Linfen's Military and Civilians Bloodily Defend the City Walls, All Personnel of the Air Transport Brigade Withdraw to Taiyuan

[Our Taiyuan Office, 3rd] The defense of Linfen is even more difficult. Most of the strongholds outside the East Gate have been destroyed by bandit artillery fire, and most of the power plants have also fallen to the bandits. The national army is working hard to recover them. The airport in the city is nearing completion with the unanimous efforts of women and children. More than 300 civil servants, students, and civilians who helped build the fortifications under artillery fire were killed or injured.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th] The defense of Linfen has reached 28 days. The focus of the war has now shifted from the East Suburb Power Plant to the North Suburb Power Plant. On the night of the 3rd, the bandit army launched a fierce attack on our strongholds in the East Gate and the four northern corners of the city. The national army bravely charged and fought fiercely all night, repelling all the bandits and killing many of them. At dawn on the 4th, the national army attacked the power plant and, after dispersing the resisting bandit army, recovered some of the positions.

[Another dispatch] Xie Hanwen, engineer of the Civil Air Transport Brigade stranded in Linfen, radio operators Shen Shubo and Cheng Yu, were transported to Taiyuan on the 4th by pilot Bao Bu, who volunteered to fly a "flying jeep". In addition to the above-mentioned three people, the team's stranded personnel after the siege of Linfen also included Chief of Flight History Stewart, and Yunshu Peng Keli Sun Yuan. Wei Luoer, deputy manager of the team, brought a flying jeep from Shanghai to Taiyuan. After first evacuating Shi and Peng, the evacuation was shelved due to the poor airport in Linfen. This second time, Tian Lin returned to Taiyuan. The engine suddenly malfunctioned on the way, but fortunately the pilot was skilled and arrived safely in Ping.

### Large-Scale Encirclement and Suppression Around Changchun, National Army Continuously Captures Multiple Strongholds, Bandit Army on the North Bank of the Liao River Has Been Defeated

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 4th] On the night of the 3rd, the powerful National Army launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of the bandits who invaded the Dafangshen Airport northwest of Changchun, and captured the Mama Oil Mill, Chenjiawazi, Sujiayingzi, and other strongholds overnight. The bandits' Independent 5th Division and the Meng Cavalry 18th Regiment were annihilated by more than half, abandoning more than 800 corpses. The remnants of the bandits fled north at dawn, and the national army is currently tracking and sweeping them.

The defending troops pursued and suppressed them in all directions on the 4th. The national army advancing eastward from Xincai officially joined forces with the Cheyang defending troops on the 4th.

According to reports, the Fuyang offensive and defensive battle lasted for five days and nights. Because the national army's land and air forces closely cooperated in combat day and night, exerting great power, the bandits suffered about 10,000 casualties in consecutive days, and more than half of their elite troops were damaged.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 3rd] The Henan local troops recovered the county towns of Weichuan and Yanling separately on the 2nd.

### Fierce Battle in the Middle Section of the Jiaoji Railway

Bandits Outside Changle Near the City Pass

[Our Jinan Office, 4th] After the battles in Changle and Weixian in the middle section of the Jiaoji Railway broke out, the bandits launched a fierce attack on Changle and Hanting on the 3rd, and the battle situation was very fierce. The bandits outside Changle approached the east, west, and north gates on the night of the 3rd, and a fierce battle was brewing. The struggle for Jiulong Mountain, Fenghuang Mountain, Bailang Mountain, and other areas outside Hanting was particularly fierce. There was a small contact outside the Fangzi Airport, and the airport is still firmly defended by the national army.

[Our Qingdao Office, 4th] Weixian Telegram: The bandit army outside Changle and Weixian is composed of the Second, Seventh, Ninth, Thirteenth, New Fifth, and New Eighth columns, as well as local armed forces, totaling about 80,000 people. They are currently continuing to press on towards various strongholds.

[Our Jinan Office, 4th] Our reporter recently visited a senior general who flew to Weixian with Wang Yaowu yesterday and asked what the bandits' attempt to attack Weixian this time was? According to reports: After the bandits attacked Jinan last month and were defeated by the national army, they are still gathering their remnants and intend to occupy Changle and Weixian in order to fulfill their dream of opening up the Jiaodong Corridor. Moreover, the defending troops in the Chang and Wei areas are the Zhang Tianzuo troops, who have a reputation for suppressing bandits. Zhang's troops have always been feared by the bandits, and they are currently concentrating all their forces in central Shandong, attempting to strike Zhang's main force. However, Zhang's troops are in high spirits, and all of their troops are local soldiers, who are determined to fight the bandits to the death. Wang Yaowu went to Wei this time and gave many instructions. The fortifications of Weixian City are as solid as gold. It is believed that under Wang's command, the Communist bandits will never succeed.

### Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement, Government Accepts US Aid with Heavy Heart, Promotes Democracy and Constitutional Government Without Avoiding Difficulties

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The US aid to China bill was signed by President Truman on April 3. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the 4th:

The US aid to China bill has been passed by the US Congress and signed by the US President. The Chinese government and people are delighted to hear this. This is another expression of US friendship to China and a recognition of China's serious situation by the United States.

The various clauses of this bill remain to be implemented by the two governments in a spirit of cooperation. What I want to solemnly state at this time is that the passage of this bill may give the Chinese people a major spiritual encouragement. The impact of this bill cannot be estimated solely by the amount of money.

However, the Chinese government accepts this bill with a very heavy heart, because we will inevitably bear the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of this bill. China is facing many difficulties today. At a time when the Communist Party is openly causing chaos and inflation is rampant, other countries may take other political paths if they encounter similar situations. However, we are determined to promote democracy and constitutional government at this time. The Chinese government will implement this political plan and the ten economic self-help plans announced by President Zhang with great determination and perseverance. This is the road to reaching China's unification and construction, and it is also the way to preserve the peace and security of the entire Far East. As long as we move towards this goal, our efforts will not be lonely. This is what I firmly believe.

### Scope of Use of US Aid Medical Subsidy Funds Has Been Drafted

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of Health convened a meeting of health bureau chiefs from various provinces and cities on the 20th of last month to discuss the principles for the use of US aid to China medical subsidy funds and application procedures.

The aim is to gain time and apply them rationally. As for the subsidy figures for each province and city, they will be decided separately based on the actual needs and local conditions of each place. No discussion was held at the meeting. The application for this subsidy will be closed in June of this year. The scope of use is roughly as follows: (1) medical relief, (2) epidemic prevention (plague and cholera), (3) tuberculosis prevention, (4) maternal and child health and child nutrition, (5) construction of medical and health institutions.

### Editorial: After the Signing of the U.S. Foreign Aid Bill

After the U.S. foreign aid bill was passed by a joint conference of both houses of Congress, President Truman signed it into law in less than twenty-four hours, and the State Department will begin implementing it within thirty-six hours. Such swift action by a democratic country is rare in peacetime America. Moreover, upon reviewing its contents, the total amount of U.S. foreign aid is $6.098 billion, which will be used to help countries in Europe and Asia resist the invasion and expansion of communist forces. This includes $463 million in economic and military aid to China. Therefore, this foreign aid bill is the most significant foreign aid since the U.S. wartime Lend-Lease Act. Its signing and enactment during the height of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War makes its significance even greater. As President Truman said at the signing: "This foreign aid bill is truly an answer from the United States to the challenges facing the free world today." However, President Truman repeatedly stated: "The United States is taking this measure to seek the recovery, stability, and peace of the world. Therefore, the purpose of this bill is to help other countries maintain conditions that allow free institutions to exist. The American people are determined to work towards world peace, and this provides clear evidence of that." At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall, who was attending the Pan-American Conference in the capital of Colombia, was delighted to receive the news of President Truman's signing of the foreign aid bill, saying: "The signing of this bill is a historic step in American foreign policy."

The large-scale U.S. foreign aid plan was first proposed by Secretary of State Marshall in a speech at Harvard University on June 15th last year. This issue has sparked intense debate in both American public opinion and in both houses of Congress. As the saying goes, "the wise see wisdom, and the benevolent see benevolence," and opinions varied greatly. In November of last year, President Truman, seeing the deepening international crisis, convened a special session of Congress, which passed an emergency foreign aid bill of $597 million. The long-term aid to Europe bill proposed by President Truman was debated until today, when it finally reached a concrete conclusion, and the long-term aid plan can now be implemented. The slowness of this development process has caused people around the world to express concern about the slow action of democratic countries. However, this time, seeing President Truman's swift action, one cannot help but feel optimistic. As President Truman said: "The passage of the foreign aid bill contains a significant meaning, which is that a bipartisan policy can enable us to take effective action; it also proves that taking swift and effective action for peace does not conflict with our democratic discussions." Therefore, President Truman's swift signing of the foreign aid bill has given us the following thoughts:

First, the U.S. government has now become particularly alert to the current international crisis. The recent series of tragic events in Czech democracy has not only made the American people deeply aware of the threat of communist forces, but has also shaken President Truman's confidence in world peace. Therefore, the United States has no choice but to catch up quickly in order to save the world from collapse. Looking at Europe, although the Western European Union of five countries has been established, it is weak and cannot confront the Eastern European bloc. If the United States does not immediately provide economic assistance, the Western European Union will be meaningless. In particular, the Soviet Union's ambition towards Italy is obvious to all. With the general election on April 18th approaching, and seeing the activity of the Italian communists, if the United States continues to stand idly by, the victory of the Italian communists is assured. If that happens, the Soviet iron curtain will move from Eastern Europe to the Atlantic Mediterranean. What would be the point of providing aid at that time! At the same time, there is a similar crisis in Asia. China is at the forefront of anti-communism and is currently fighting against communist bandits with international backgrounds. In general, the situation in Asia is better than in Europe, but if the United States does not immediately provide economic and military assistance to China, Asia will follow in the footsteps of Europe, allowing the Soviet Union to establish an unshakeable position in Asia. Therefore, whether in Europe or in Asia, immediate assistance is urgently needed. This is why the U.S. government has been able to act so quickly. Therefore, looking to the future, in order to deal with the Soviet Union's Cold War, the United States will be able to take swift and effective action at any time to stop the Soviet Union from continuing to expand its influence, and will no longer lag behind as before. However, on the Soviet side, it will inevitably step up its efforts to sabotage the U.S. foreign aid plan. This can also be asserted. Therefore, we predict that the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union will become increasingly fierce in the future.

Second, the United States has a special responsibility for maintaining world peace and has now begun to shoulder this responsibility. It feels that both Europe and Asia are very dangerous, so it provides economic assistance. However, judging from the spirit of this bill, the focus of U.S. foreign aid is still biased towards Europe. They still believe that the crisis in Europe is the most profound, that the relationship between Europe and the United States is the closest, and that aid to European countries is more likely to be effective. Therefore, the assistance given to European countries by the United States is greater in quantity and has priority in time. Although we cannot be too subjective when observing the world situation, we ultimately believe that the United States' "Europe First" policy is a terrible prejudice that could lead to historical mistakes, placing the United States in an irreparable predicament in the Far East. Therefore, we still hope that the U.S. diplomatic authorities will broaden their horizons and observe the situation in the Far East in order to understand its interests and use them as a guideline for carrying out economic and military aid to China.

Third, the U.S. aid to China is still insufficient, both in quantity and time. Achieving the goal of "promoting peace and economic stability in China" is a very serious issue. However, a country surviving in the current international society should value independence. It must not harbor illusions of relying on other countries. Today's China needs foreign aid to revive and build the nation due to material difficulties, but we cannot place all our hopes on foreign aid. The most important thing is to rely on our own efforts. Now that the United States has begun to provide economic and military assistance to China, our country's only task is how to make U.S. aid effective! As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Only in this way can we ensure that a large amount of U.S. aid comes continuously! This is something that the entire nation, both the government and the people, must deeply reflect on.

### News Freedom Conference - A Wonderful Overture - Dr. Zhang Pengchun Engages in a Verbal Duel with Bogomolov

[Our Correspondent in Geneva, March 25] Winter quietly departs the Alps, and the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press brings boundless spring to Lake Geneva. The blue lake reflects the "League of Nations Building" standing on its shore, a milky white structure shimmering with rays of light in the sun. This "Palace of Peace," built with ten years of effort and millions of US dollars, once, before World War II, saw "peace envoys" from various countries appear like ephemerals. Now, times have changed, and it has become a place for our journalists to negotiate.

Defeated the Soviet Motion with Twenty-Seven Votes to Six

Bogomolov is the Soviet Ambassador to France, a balding, burly, and dignified diplomat. He shares the same surname as the former Soviet Ambassador to China but has no family relationship. Last early winter, the United Nations Human Rights Commission met in Geneva, and the Soviet side was also led by this Bogomolov, engaging in debates with Mrs. Roosevelt. This time, at the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, Bogomolov fired the first shot, wanting the member states of the United Nations, and those invited to participate in the news freedom conference, such as Romania and Bulgaria, to have the right to vote. Bogomolov's proposal was that before the election of the chairman of the electoral college, Dr. Zhang Pengchun, the chief representative of China, advocated that the chairman should be elected according to procedure, without inserting unexpected side issues. The so-called "according to established procedure" meant that, according to the original intention of the Social and Economic Council, non-UNC member states invited to attend had the right to speak but no right to vote. After a verbal battle, China defeated the Soviet Union's temporary motion with twenty-seven votes to six.

Three Wonderful Debates – Purely Diplomatic Issues

On the first day of the meeting alone, Zhang Pengchun and Bogomolov clashed three times, and all three times were extremely wonderful debates, but they all belonged to purely diplomatic issues. There was very little direct relationship with the freedom of the press itself. The first time was the election of the chairman of the conference, before the election issue of the non-member state delegation. The second time was when Bogomolov raised the issue of the right to vote for non-member states again after the chairman of the conference was elected. On that occasion, the Soviet side's lineup was very aggressive. First, Bogomolov spoke, followed by the representative of Bulgaria, a young man with curly hair and a gentle demeanor. He wore a blue suit and shook his long hair from time to time when he spoke. When excited, he would tap the table with his pencil, saying: "The United Nations invited us to participate, of course, they want us to participate in the discussion. If they want us to participate in the discussion, then we should be treated as brothers. Why should we be divided into member states and non-member states? Drawing a dividing line? If everyone thinks we are not worthy of the right to vote, then we might as well pack up and go home!"

Going in Circles – British Representative Speaks the Truth

This typical Slavic youth seemed to have an admirable enthusiasm. When he just raised his hand to speak, Chairman Romulo on the rostrum, because he had never seen him in any international setting, Romulo loudly asked the secretaries sitting on both sides: "Who is he?" Later, after checking the seat charts of various countries, he realized that he was the representative of Bulgaria.

The British representative, Mr. MacNeil, spoke most tactfully and earnestly. MacNeil was the chief of the British delegation this time. He opposed the Soviet proposal, but for the first ten minutes, he almost only spoke complimentary words, going in eighteen big circles, and finally said the true intention of the British delegation: "According to the intention of the Social and Economic Council, non-member states only have the right to speak, and definitely do not have the right to vote!"

French and Belgian Chief Representatives – Advocate Opening Voting Rights

France and Belgium are in favor of opening up voting rights. They believe that the United Nations organization should be open so that the foundation of the United Nations can be gradually expanded, without any restrictions of parochialism. The Belgian representative spoke very clearly, like a university professor lecturing on laws or formulas, winning applause from many Eastern European countries.

The most wonderful thing was the representatives of Albania and Greece. The chief representative of Albania had a hoarse voice, as if he had just caught a cold. At first, he supported his head with his right hand, and then simply leaned his upper body on the podium. He recited many of Albania's "War of Resistance" achievements, and then talked about how many people Albania had, how much land, and why it did not have the right to vote. He also said: Albania loves peace, and although it is not a "member state," it has long had a tendency to join the United Nations. This time, Albania was invited to participate in the discussion of "Freedom of the Press," and of course, it should enjoy the right to vote.

The Greek representative stood up and denounced Albania and Bulgaria, accusing them of aggressive behavior against Greece, "People see each other as rivals are especially hostile." This Greek chief representative, with a red head and face like Guan Yu, delivered a long speech that was tens of thousands of miles away from "Freedom of the Press," and finally said: "I agree with the opinions of the United States, Britain, and China that non-member states do not have the right to vote!"

Seizing on Other People's Loopholes – Winning Much Applause

Zhang Pengchun was undoubtedly the most brilliant performer in the morning and afternoon sessions of the first day. His fluent English and quick thinking enabled him to debate logically. He seized on a loophole in the Bulgarian representative's argument and then repeatedly emphasized the shortcomings of the other party's theory, winning much applause. A British colleague gave me a thumbs up and said: "He is a great debater!" Another American colleague said: "Zhang Pengchun's eloquence is really excellent, but he is a bit too theatrical!"

Zhang Pengchun not only spoke well on the first day but also spoke a lot. His third debate with the Russian delegation was for the "Outer Mongolia issue." The Soviet representative suddenly gave a long "Overview of Outer Mongolia" in the middle of the agenda, reporting how many schools Outer Mongolia had opened, how many factories had been built, how many theaters had been built, and how many newspapers and books had been published since the "People's Revolution" in 1921. He also claimed that "It is inappropriate to prevent Outer Mongolia from sending representatives to the Freedom of the Press Conference." Therefore, Russia proposed to supplement the list of delegates to the conference with Outer Mongolia.

The Issue of Outer Mongolia's Attendance – Was Also Defeated

This unexpected difficulty was still "parried" back by Zhang Pengchun. The chief representative of the United States, William Benton, said anxiously: "Should we spend more time discussing freedom of the press? Or should we continue to debate in this roundabout way?" He cried out loudly: "Don't spend more time tampering with the agenda and rules of procedure." This meaning was roughly the same as that of the Chinese delegation. William Benton used to be the Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, and with his rich experience, he naturally spoke very appropriately.

International conferences are nothing more than debates. Any diplomatic disputes always have two lines that are very clearly divided. The start of the Freedom of the Press Conference was no exception. (At the Hotel des Etrangers)

### Berlin Traffic Control Issues - Soviet Union Willing to Negotiate with the United States - Soviet Commander in Germany Accepts British Invitation to Banquet - US Military Police Ordered to Withdraw from Around the Railway Bureau Building

[United Press, Berlin, 4th] The Soviet Union today formally notified the US military authorities that it is willing to negotiate on the issue of traffic control in the Soviet-occupied zone in order to clarify the current situation. This is the first move by the Soviet Union to be willing to renegotiate with the United States since March 20, when it withdrew from the Allied Control Council for Germany. It is not yet known whether the Soviet Union has made the same notification to Britain and France. According to the US military government, although the Soviet notification reiterated its original position, it expressed its willingness to negotiate on some control details, but did not mention a date.

[Reuters, Herford, 3rd] British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery arrived in Mele City in the British zone of Germany today by special plane. He will first talk with British Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Robertson, and convene a secret meeting of senior staff of the British Army in the Rhine, before going to Berlin on Tuesday.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] The British Reynolds News reported on the 4th that the Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Army in Germany, Sokolovsky, has accepted the invitation of British Commander-in-Chief Robertson to attend the banquet hosted by General Robertson next Tuesday. It also said that Marshal Montgomery is expected to attend the banquet.

[United Press, Berlin, 4th] At 1:10 a.m. this morning, the Soviet Union accepted the US request and ordered its eight armed guards to withdraw from the Railway Bureau Building in the US-occupied zone of Berlin. About 50 US military police who surrounded the building began to withdraw five hours later. The US notification last night requesting the Soviet Union to withdraw its guards stated that the appearance of Soviet soldiers in the US-occupied zone violated jurisdictional regulations, and if armed protection was necessary, the US military should handle it itself. It is believed that the encirclement of the Railway Bureau Building is just a gesture by the US military authorities in Berlin, aimed at responding to the Soviet Union's traffic control orders.

### Berlin Railway Traffic Gradually Returning to Normal - US Air Transport Work Stops - Soviet Fighter Groups Hold Night Exercises

[Our Dispatch] New York, 4th Broadcasting: Frankfurt News, the US Air Force Command in Europe announced that it will stop air transport as soon as the goods prepared at the Frankfurt airport for transport to Berlin are shipped. This shows that railway traffic to Berlin has gradually returned to normal, and the food supply in the US-occupied zone of Berlin will not be in short supply.

Also News, air transport work has stopped tonight.

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] Armed US troops today set up obstacles at the intersection of the main road from Berlin to Potsdam as "retaliation," because the Soviet Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Sokolovsky, lives in Potsdam. US troops are also stationed at other road junctions from Soviet Berlin to the US zone, checking passersby. Two British coal trains and one US supply train have safely arrived in Berlin. The Soviet interference seems to be limited to passenger trains of the Allied side, and air transport and road traffic are operating normally as usual.

However, the Soviet authorities have notified the US military government that an unusually large number of Soviet fighter planes will be engaged in exercises last night, and the exercises will continue on the night of the 3rd. This notice has been forwarded to the pilots of the British, American and French aircraft using the Berlin air corridor. People from the British and American sides expect that the Soviet Union may soon further interfere with air traffic, but a spokesman for the British military government said that the night-time dispatch of large numbers of Soviet fighter planes is not unusual, as it is part of the Soviet army's spring maneuvers.

### Wartime Documents - Published by the Soviet Foreign Ministry - Exposing Britain's Appeasement Policy

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] The first volume of wartime documents published by the Soviet Foreign Ministry, "Documents on the Eve of World War II," went on sale today. It includes the files of the former German Foreign Ministry from November 1937 to December 1938. This is the darkest period in European diplomatic history. Forty-four of them clearly show that Britain spared no sacrifice to appease Hitler's diplomatic policy. At the beginning, Lord Halifax (former British Foreign Secretary) and Henderson (former British Ambassador to Germany's meeting records with Hitler) stated Chamberlain's (former British Prime Minister) original intention to cooperate with Hitler. Regarding the entire Czech crisis, the documents show Britain's deceptive actions against the Czech government. The ending of the documents, the letter from the Polish Ambassador to Britain, shows that Chamberlain's prestige has been declining due to his endless policy of appeasement. Another document is the record of the meeting between the British Ambassador to the Czech Republic and the Czech Foreign Minister, showing that Britain was unwilling to guarantee the independence of the Czech Republic after the Munich Agreement.

### Implementation of the European Aid Program - Welcomed by France and Italy

French Communists Are Preparing a Counter-Plan

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] Prime Minister Schuman welcomed President Truman's signing of the foreign aid bill, saying that "the Marshall Plan will supply Europe with a large amount of materials, which is the main factor for Europe's economic recovery and the basic help for social and political stability. The recipient countries, especially France, will definitely not be deceived by those who falsely claim that the plan is a tool of war." Finance Minister Mayer said: "When President Truman signed the bill, I and all citizens of the free world recognized the importance of this minute. We should answer the kindness of the United States with our efforts to restore and rebuild the shattered society."

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] More than 7,000 French Communists have gathered in Paris this weekend to prepare a plan to counter the Marshall Plan. They are union representatives of the Joint Management Committee established by law three years ago.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 3rd] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi sent a telegram to US Secretary of State Marshall, praising Marshall as the "promoter" of the European recovery plan. The telegram stated: "Your government has created the European recovery plan based on the principles of peace and human love, and has given great contributions to this plan, allowing free Italy to have the opportunity for international cooperation. I would like to express my highest respect to you."

### Soviet Ambassador Arrives in Turkey to Take Office

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 3rd] The new Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Lavrentiev, arrived here today.

[United Press, Capital of Finland, 3rd] The Finnish Cabinet today decided on the final reply to the Soviet Union's request to conclude a security treaty, which will be taken to Moscow by the two Finnish representatives. Informed sources said that Finnish President Paasikivi originally intended to agree that if the Soviet Union encountered a direct attack, Finland would defend its own borders, but Finland should have the right to decide the time of such an attack threat and when military cooperation with the Soviet Union should begin. It is not yet known whether the new instructions follow the same approach.

[Reuters, Helsinki, 4th] A reporter for the Chicago Daily Tribune said: Highly reliable sources revealed the following situation of the Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance treaty negotiations held in Moscow: At the beginning of the meeting, Foreign Minister Molotov asked the Finnish delegation whether it could use the Soviet-Hungarian, Soviet-Czech and Soviet-Romanian treaties as a blueprint. Finnish Prime Minister Pekkala replied, emphasizing Finland's desire to maintain neutrality. Molotov urged Finland to make suggestions. Pekkala said that there were many possibilities for suggestions, expressing the hope that the Soviet Union would respect Finland's special environment. He stated that the Finnish delegation had only obtained a treaty that would only apply during wartime and within Finnish territory. The Finnish delegation then submitted a draft treaty, which included the following points: (1) If Germany or its allies attack Finland, Finland will resist the aggression with all its strength. If its own strength is not enough, the Soviet Union will provide assistance after the establishment of a mutual agreement. (2) The Soviet Union shall not enter Finland to exercise mutual assistance rights without special permission. It is reported that President Paasikivi clearly stated before the Finnish delegation set off that the Soviet Union could only provide assistance after Finland's request. He also instructed the Finnish delegation to insist that both parties must support measures to promote peace and the United Nations organization, and neither party shall conclude an explicit agreement against the other party. The two parties shall cooperate in cultural and economic aspects, and neither party shall interfere in the other's internal affairs. The Soviet Union originally requested that the treaty be valid for twenty years, but Paasikivi insisted on at most ten years. This point could not be resolved during the negotiations and has been temporarily shelved. On March 27, Prime Minister Pekkala made a broad statement to the Soviet side, stating that Finland would definitely resist aggression with its own army, navy and air force, and the military terms would only apply during wartime. If military cooperation is adopted, both parties should respect each other's sovereignty. Molotov convened a meeting of the Soviet delegation for one hour and then stated that the Soviet Union could accept the Finnish proposal as a basis for discussion. Then Molotov suggested modifying the military part of the proposal to expand its scope of application. After Paasikivi received this information from Moscow, he is now drafting new instructions for the Finnish delegation. Finnish military advisors have pointed out to the President that the proposed modification by Molotov will cause broad wording and easy to have arbitrary explanations, such as a slight incident, seeing a bomb fall on a small island outside Finland's territorial waters, etc., which is enough for the Red Army to enter Finland at a cost of "mutual defense". At least four Social Democratic Party cabinet members and one Farmers Party cabinet member oppose military concessions to the Soviet Union in the current stage of negotiations, and a majority of members of Congress also hold the same view.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Three miles from the sea surface of Atami, a famous Japanese hot spring, there is a small island named "Hatsushima", which has an area of ​​48 towns east and west, and 5 towns north and south (each town is equal to 2.45 acres), with a circumference of only 25 towns.

### News Conference Calls on the United Nations - To Fairly Distribute White Newsprint - United Nations Representative Believes that China, France and the Netherlands Have Priority

[Reuters, Geneva, 3rd] The International News Conference decided that the lack of white newsprint in most parts of the world is a fundamental obstacle to the free flow of news and ideas, and decided to request the United Nations Economic and Social Council to immediately pay attention to the increase in the world supply of white newsprint and strive for fairness in its distribution.

The representative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization attended the meeting to explain the distribution of white newsprint in various countries in 1947 and revealed that the organization had suggested to the United States to voluntarily give up ordering 50 million tons of white newsprint from Canada so that it could be distributed by China, France, The Netherlands and other three war-torn countries that need white newsprint the most. Martin, the US representative and president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, said that the US government supports this suggestion and will do its best to assist.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 3rd United Press] Romulo, Chairman of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, recently issued a statement explaining the progress since the opening of the Conference on Freedom of the Press.

He said: "The differences between the East and the West regarding the concept of freedom of the press may be reconciled. The West insists that the scope of freedom of the press should be broad, while the Eastern European countries emphasize the responsibilities that come with freedom. The West upholds the right to criticize, while the Eastern European countries believe that criticism often turns into slander. This aspect The differences do not seem to be insurmountable gaps. In essence, the differences are mainly about different emphases."

### General Chennault on American Policy Towards China

Copyright by Scripps Howard Newspaper Alliance

Translated by our Newsroom

(9) Determined to Fight Back to Burma

Strictly speaking, the China-Burma-India Theater Command, as the main wartime alliance institution, under the direction of General Stilwell, never made any military plans for China.

I am certain that the theater command's files during Stilwell's tenure will not reveal any military plans, except for the offensive across Burma, or the air operations plans the theater command received from me, the commander of the Fourteenth Air Force. If there were any other plans, at least my command did not receive them.

If there were really plans, they must have been of a very abstract nature, because the theater command lacked the military intelligence necessary for proper planning. Without reliable intelligence, it is unimaginable to have anything that could be called a plan.

The theater command never relied on intelligence from the Chinese side, which was both inaccurate and, in terms of operational value, often too slow. On the other hand, the theater command did not attempt to organize its own intelligence work, and for a period of time, actually forbade me from doing this kind of work for the Fourteenth Air Force.

Theater command personnel insisted that the Changde offensive "was just a rice-grabbing raid," although the theater command had no observers on the ground, contrary to the testimony of my own air-ground liaison officers, two of whom had experienced the siege of Changde alongside the Chinese army. They called this campaign a limited offensive.

In order to maintain air operations, I had to force the theater command to grant me the authority to establish my own intelligence system. This system, at the time Stilwell was recalled, was the only effective American intelligence agency in China.

Several months after the Battle of Changde, when the Chongqing Command established a new intelligence agency, it had recognized the necessity of an intelligence network, and my air force observers who had worked in Changde succeeded in forming its core. Later, General Donovan's Office of Strategic Services was willing to provide personnel and equipment to strengthen our new agency, but for various reasons, it never materialized, including, I know, General Stilwell's opposition.

The theater command not only did not plan for China, but was also not prepared to plan. The Burma campaign seemed to be regarded as an end in itself. Stilwell seemed intent on completely disregarding China.

He did indeed oppose making real efforts in air warfare within China, on the grounds that such efforts would provoke the Japanese. I completely fail to understand why he was so concerned about the Japanese reaction in China, while not giving any thought to the Japanese reaction in Burma.

I have always been in favor of expanding the "Hump" airlift as much as possible, partly to establish a small but effective air force, and partly to strengthen the Chinese ground forces. I believe that offensive operations are the only way to unbalance the Japanese army, until the Chinese army becomes strong enough. For many months, the air force was the only weapon on the Chinese side that could support an offensive.

During Sino-American cooperation, the main military problem was obvious, namely how to use our joint potential strength to strike the enemy in the areas most advantageous to us. General Stilwell made little or no contribution to solving this fundamental problem.

For him, and therefore for the entire American effort in this theater, was completely controlled by one goal: since 1942, Stilwell was determined to fight back to Burma, because he had commanded the Chinese Expeditionary Force during the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942 and suffered defeat.

At times, Stilwell may have sincerely felt that launching an offensive in Burma to open a land route for China was a reasonable solution to China's difficult situation, but I believed then and still believe now that his judgment was influenced by his plan to fight back to Burma.

A little analysis of the problem shows that, due to terrain and distance, a land route could at most allow a small number of truck-borne supplies to reach the southwestern terminus of China, while the almost equally important problem of transporting and distributing them within China remained unsolved. The theater command under Stilwell's command made no contribution to the effective solution of the latter problem.

Indeed, the thousands of tons of goods actually trucked to China via the Burma Road cannot be considered worth the time, lives, and resources that General Stilwell spent on it over three years.

Furthermore, if the weight of the trucks themselves is subtracted, the actual tonnage of goods carried by the Burma Road is not considerable, and it is also impractical to have trucks only drive to China without driving back. Indeed, China needs vehicles, but her own resources can at most maintain 12,000 to 15,000 vehicles, and only after a port is opened can she increase her ability to maintain vehicles. But after the port is opened, vehicles can of course be imported from the sea.

However, Stilwell did not prepare a truck plan for China, nor did he consider devising a truck two-way plan on the Burma Road after there were enough trucks for China. It is ironic that the first and largest batch of vehicles allocated to the Burma Road, 5,000 Dodge trucks, were assigned by the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration, against which Stilwell and the War Department opposed. By the end of the war in 1945, the number of vehicles that China could accommodate had reached saturation point. The theater command, under Stilwell's successor General Wedemeyer, had recognized that the one-way truck plan on the Burma Road was impractical, but Stilwell and his staff had advocated doing so from the beginning.

So the only defense for the Burma campaign is that a pipeline was built along the Burma Road, which transported fuel to southwestern China for several months.

### Renault's Mysterious Escape to Ying Island in Haste; Passport Confiscated, Difficult to Obtain Again; Both Chinese and American Officials Express Surprise and Indignation

[Reported by this newspaper] Renault's expeditionary plane, despite Renault's public guarantee that he would "not leave China before all matters were settled," once again secretly flew to Tokyo yesterday afternoon at 1:45 pm under the pretext of a test flight. Renault himself dramatically boarded the plane after the engine started, staging a scene of escape. His passport was confiscated, leaving an indelible stain on his personal credibility in China.

The expeditionary plane secretly flew from Shanghai to India on the morning of the 2nd, and returned in the evening. On the morning of the 3rd, Renault took a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane to Nanjing to explain to our authorities, admitting "impoliteness and lack of consideration," and guaranteed that the expeditionary plane would not leave China before the Chinese members of the expedition returned to Nanjing and all matters were settled. At the same time, he claimed that his plane needed to be refueled and the engine started from time to time, otherwise it would be damaged. At that time, our side approved his request and immediately notified the Shanghai Civil Aviation Bureau to reduce the original two guards to one, and allowed him to refuel. Unexpectedly, the plane suddenly flew away yesterday under the pretext of refueling and testing the engine.

Renault himself arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing by night train, with secretive movements. At 8:15 am, he called a taxi from Daxin Bus Company, number 21180, driven by the driver Bian Xilin, at the Broadway Mansions, first went to the Cathay Hotel, instructed the car to wait outside. About two hours later, he took the original car back to the Broadway Mansions. Near the Waibaidu Bridge, he turned back to the Cathay Hotel, and took down his luggage with his pilot and others, and drove straight to Longhua Airport, around 12:00 noon. After arriving at the airport, he still instructed the car to wait. The driver Bian Xilin waited until 2:00 pm and found that Renault and others had already flown away. Because the fare was not paid, he stomped his feet and jumped around. Later, he found 2 million national currency on the seat cushion, and then drove back. From this, it can be seen that Renault had already planned to fly away, and his instruction to the driver to wait was just to create a false impression.

Deceiving the Airport Police Officer

After Renault arrived at the airport, he claimed that he was refueling and testing the engine, so the Civil Aviation Bureau office did not suspect anything and allowed his pilot to board the plane. At 1:15 pm, the plane's engine was started once and then stopped. At 1:30 pm, Renault himself was discovered by Xie Dingfeng, the foreign affairs police inspector stationed at the airport. Because he had flown to India without permission on the 2nd, and his passport had not gone through the exit visa procedures, which was illegal, Xie Inspector immediately asked for his passport for confiscation. Renault initially claimed that his passport was in the hotel and had not been brought. Xie Inspector told him that he could call the hotel and send someone to deliver it. Renault then made a phone call in the telephone booth. (This call was later learned to be made to the US Consulate because half an hour after Renault flew away, the US Consulate sent someone to the airport to ask the police if they intended to detain Renault himself. The people at the consulate also expressed surprise at Renault's sudden flight.) After making the call for a considerable amount of time, Renault suddenly claimed that he remembered that the passport was with him, and immediately took it out and handed it over. Xie Inspector then gave him a receipt and confiscated the passport. At this time, Renault saw that the plane's engine had been started twice, and told Xie Inspector that someone in the airport was asking him for a pen, and he was going to get it on the plane. Xie Inspector's duty was only to confiscate his passport, so he let him run to the plane.

As soon as Renault boarded the plane, the fuselage immediately started and drove to the runway, and took off in a blink of an eye. The Civil Aviation Bureau had sent one guard to watch, but because the incident happened suddenly, they could only watch him leave.

Ignoring the Air Traffic Control's Impedance

This sudden action was not only unexpected by the Civil Aviation Bureau, but also unknown to the Air Traffic Control beforehand, so it was absolutely illegal to fly. The airport control tower then instructed it to land by radio and shone red lights on it. The air traffic control station managed by the US military in Jiangwan also notified it by radio, but the plane ignored it and quickly disappeared. It wasn't until 4:12 pm that it sent a telegram to the US Air Force control station reporting its position, stating that it was en route to Tokyo. At 7:30 pm, it was reported again that it had landed at Haneda Airport in Tokyo without permission.

According to the personnel of the Air Traffic Control, according to aviation rules, the plane must start at the end of the runway when taking off, but the expeditionary plane took off immediately after turning into the runway. Also, the take-off must be in the upwind direction, but the expeditionary plane took off to the south in the downwind direction, so Renault's plane violated international aviation rules in more than one way. The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Bureau has telegraphed the situation to the Nanjing authorities, which may cause a negotiation between China and the United States.

The U.S. Embassy Expresses Surprise

In addition, according to a Nanjing telegraphic dispatch: the US Embassy has also learned about Renault's escape and the confiscation of his passport, and is very surprised by Renault's actions, and expressed that the US government may not give him a new passport in the future.

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing, American officials and Chinese scientists are deeply indignant at Renault's behavior. Sabin Dong, Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica, accused Renault of failing to keep his promise that he would not leave China until the disputes caused by the expedition were resolved. Officials from the US Embassy personally witnessed Renault make this promise to Mr. Sa, and will now submit a detailed report to Washington and Tokyo. However, it is said that if formal action is to be taken against Renault's sudden departure from Shanghai without permission, it must be initiated by the Chinese government.

### Renault Talks About the Reasons for Leaving China: To Avoid Economic Difficulties

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 4th Broadcast: Tokyo News, Renault has arrived here. He said that the reason why he flew out of China without permission was to avoid possible economic difficulties. Up to now, the funds spent for this adventure work have reached US$250,000.

### The Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, Gan Zengjue, Inspected the Shangchuan Railway Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Gan Zengjue, director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, crossed the Huangpu River to Qingning Temple yesterday afternoon to inspect the Shangchuan Railway Company. He inquired in detail about the restoration of the company after the war, and encouraged the employees to work diligently and carefully in order to achieve the purpose of serving the citizens.

### Spring Tour Attacked by Machine Gun; Five Employees of the Radio Station Injured

[Reported by this newspaper] Thirty-two staff members of the Traffic Department Shanghai International Radio Station went to Changshu for a spring tour yesterday morning on a United Electric Company bus. At 8:20 am, when they drove to Taicang Station, two soldiers from the 202nd Youth Army and two policemen from Taicang County were responsible for checking the passing vehicles. The bus, unaware of the situation, stopped briefly and then continued to drive, causing the sentries to misunderstand, resulting in the tragedy of five people being shot. Among them, the most seriously injured was Yao Benyu of the Reporting Group, who was shot twice in the left leg, and the leg bone was broken. Jiang Zongyuan, a clerk, was shot in the right leg, and Bao Cha Xue Yonggui was shot in the leg bone. In addition, there were two other people, the radio station lawyer Lu Weilin and the Bao Cha Guo Yongmin, who were slightly injured. The injured were sent to Taicang Public Hospital for treatment. The former three were still hospitalized in Taicang due to their serious injuries. Lu and Guo, who were slightly injured, were treated and returned to Shanghai with the car yesterday for treatment.

The cause of this incident is said to be that when the bus of United Electric Company passed the checkpoint, it drove off without being checked, which dissatisfied the sentries. At first, they fired warning shots, but the bus could not stop in time, which further aroused the misunderstanding of the sentry Lu Zhenyu, who then fired with a portable machine gun. It is heard that Yao Benyu's injury is because the leg bone has been shattered, and if the bone-setting procedure can be completed smoothly, he will have to recuperate for at least three or four months. Yao was originally scheduled to get engaged next week, but unfortunately suffered this accident, which will inevitably delay the good day.

### Cold Food and Tomb-Sweeping Day; Sad to Come to This Place; Pilgrimage to Hongqiao Cemetery

[Reported by this newspaper] After inspecting Hongqiao Cemetery for a week, we found that "Tomb-Sweeping Day" is a festival where human nature is thoroughly revealed.

In front of the desolate grave of the famous dancer Fang Zhen, the pine and cypress trees have grown to several feet high. Someone put a bunch of flowers on her grave, was it someone who knew her in life? Or was it her former patron? No name was left, but we seemed to smell the warmth and fragrance of friendship from the flowers. Two days ago, someone came to clear the weeds from the tomb of the martyr Cheng Zhenzhang. According to the person in charge of the tomb, it was a friend of his in life, lonely and working hard for several hours. Are there really such friends in this world, in this society?

On a stone tablet, a few lines of English are engraved: "Write my wounded heart on this stone, I will never forget the misty evening when I said goodbye to you." It is said that lying under the stone tablet is an Austrian girl who died eighteen years ago. Her husband is a foreigner who has lived in Shanghai for many years and is now middle-aged. After the girl died, he vowed never to marry. Every year around Tomb-Sweeping Day, he must come to the tomb to silently recite the inscriptions on the tablet for a week. He has not come this year. Some people speculate that he may have returned to his country with a melancholy heart.

An old couple was supervising the craftsmen to prune the flowers and plants next to their deceased son's tomb, and personally bent down to sweep away the fallen leaves. Behind them, a foreigner was silently reciting the Bible in front of a cross. Another old man was walking around a tomb with a cane, muttering, "Eat slowly! You always hiccup!" It turned out that a pot of homemade pastries was placed on the tomb.

Some places are burning tin foil, and some places are offering sacrifices. Everyone in front of the tomb seems so kind and solemn. Many tombstones are engraved with the deceased's last words: "My heart is here, I am going to my real home." Although life and death are forever separated, this true essence of human nature hidden in each other is fully expressed on Tomb-Sweeping Day.

### The Origin Story of Reynolds

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Stocky build, ruddy complexion, ballpoint pen tycoon Reynolds exudes a strong air of a businessman. This American millionaire who brazenly declared his intention to conquer the new world has lived a life of adventure filled with ups and downs. Starting with twenty-five US dollars, Reynolds made his fortune twice, only to lose it all twice. Now, renowned worldwide for manufacturing ballpoint pens, this is his third fortune.

At the age of twenty, Reynolds earned twenty-five US dollars by handling the sale of a used car. He used this twenty-five dollars to buy a small tire repair shop, patching tires and fixing tubes for people. The business of the small shop was ordinary, and there was no prospect of great success.

Returning in Triumph with a Flash of Inspiration

However, he knew how to seize opportunities. At that time, a car company closed down and put a large stock of tires up for sale. Reynolds had a flash of inspiration and immediately bought all these tires at a very low price. Then, he immediately went to a Chicago Tribune advertising salesman and commissioned a full-page advertisement in the newspaper, stating that he had a large number of tires and was willing to sell them at extremely low prices. After the advertisement was typeset, he took the "proof" to the Chicago representative of the manufacturer of these tires. The representative, seeing the advertisement offering a large quantity at such a low price, feared that the entire tire market price would be affected and plummet, and immediately called the New York headquarters for instructions. The headquarters ordered him to purchase the tires from Reynolds, which was exactly what Reynolds wanted. He asked for a high price and returned in triumph, then notified the Chicago Tribune to cancel the advertisement. In this way, he gained a fortune out of thin air. From then on, he continued to operate his business, and by the age of twenty-six, he had already joined the ranks of the wealthy.

Broke in New York with Only One Dollar Left

As his wealth increased, so did his desires. Reynolds used his capital to engage in various ventures, inevitably making mistakes. At the age of thirty, he went bankrupt. But as the saying goes, "if you fall, you can get back up." Within five years, he had made even more money. However, in 1930, the nationwide depression wave swept him back onto the streets. At that time, he was thirty-eight years old.

Christmas was approaching, and he was stranded in New York, about to spend his last dollar. The situation was very embarrassing. The day before Christmas, he managed to borrow one hundred and fifty dollars and returned to Chicago with his wife, hoping to come up with ideas in his hometown.

Second Time on the Road to Fortune

The day after Christmas, he got up at six o'clock in the morning and wandered around the city, hoping to find some inspiration for making money. From six in the morning to six in the evening, from Monday to Wednesday, he walked around like a madman, and as a result, he actually found it. He saw a machine for printing signs displayed in a shop and felt that there was "something there," so he ran into the shop and asked the owner to demonstrate how the machine worked. The second day, he arranged to talk with the shop owner. Using his eloquence and wit, he bought the patent rights to this machine. On the one hand, he asked friends to help borrow some money, and on the second Monday, he started a factory to manufacture it. This machine was specially designed for shops to print signs and posters. Sales were excellent, and Reynolds from then on sailed smoothly and embarked on the road to fortune again.

Successful Adventure in Starting a Pen Manufacturing Business

Reynolds' ballpoint pen business was also a successful adventure. In 1945, he traveled to South America, where he saw the early ballpoint pens. He bought several pens and returned to the United States, carefully studied and improved them, and then started manufacturing them himself. At this time, another pen merchant had already spent money to buy the patent rights for ballpoint pens in South America. Hearing that Reynolds was already manufacturing them, he warned the merchants who had placed orders with Reynolds to cancel their orders, otherwise he would file a lawsuit. Reynolds was very panicked. He immediately hired many legal experts to help him find a solution. According to American law, he was only allowed to sue in court and could not issue warnings. Reynolds first sued the other party in court for intimidation. As a result, he achieved a legally unbeatable position. In this way, retailers continued to place orders with him. When his ballpoint pen was first launched, the buyers rushed in like a tide. Many police officers were temporarily hired to maintain order. Ten thousand pens were sold on the first day. In the first month, he earned five hundred thousand dollars, and in the second month, he earned one million five hundred thousand dollars. In less than a year, his assets reached an astronomical figure.

The Ballpoint Pen Boom Was Just a Flash in the Pan

However, the sales boom of ballpoint pens was just a flash in the pan. Soon, American manufacturers were producing more and more every day, and his business became increasingly sluggish. At this time, Reynolds began to use his brain again. He bought his own plane, traveled around the world, and asked his pilot Auden to break the record for round-the-world flight, making Reynolds famous in the world and bringing his ballpoint pens to all parts of the world.

This time, Reynolds thought of exploring China, arriving with great fanfare and leaving with a whimper. We dare not say for sure whether his motive was to promote ballpoint pens, but at least the fact that he gave away ballpoint pens in China is true. The most ridiculous thing is that among the ballpoint pens he gave away, some had a "US$25" sticker on the pen case. In fact, this pen is not worth even one US dollar. Reynolds' character can be seen from this.

### General Prices Still Maintain Stable Trend of Previous Week

The cyclical fluctuations of prices in the later stages of inflation are an inevitable phenomenon that comes with inflation. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there have been five major fluctuations. The Association has already listed and explained them before (see the January 12th issue of the Liberty Forum and the New Year's Day special issue of the News on January 1st). At the beginning of February this year, after the Lunar New Year, the first major price fluctuation of this year began. According to the characteristics of the later stages of inflation described in the first issue of this journal, the increase in the frequency of price cyclical fluctuations is an inevitable fact. This major fluctuation is only the first major fluctuation of this year.

As mentioned in the previous issue of this journal, this fluctuation started in the first week after the Lunar New Year and reached its peak in the second week of March, which is the fifth week after the Lunar New Year. In that week, the general wholesale price index rose by 28.6%. In terms of individual commodities, building materials rose by 54%, while food and textiles rose by more than 32%. After that week's more intense fluctuations, the amplitude of price fluctuations gradually decreased, and credit gradually tightened, as if this major fluctuation had entered a period of intermission. Three weeks have passed since that week to last week. Many factors have made prices slightly stable during these three weeks, and this journal has listed them one by one in the previous two issues. Among these reasons, the more common and longer-lasting effects on prices are as follows. These reasons still had a great impact on prices last week:

First, the sharp rise in prices in Shanghai has resulted in a significant excess compared to the interior. As a result, a large amount of floating capital in Shanghai flowed into the interior, which can be seen in the increase in the domestic exchange rate. In the past three or four weeks, prices in the interior have been constantly rising due to the invasion of a large amount of floating capital, especially in Chongqing, Changsha, Kunming, and other places.

Second, the recent unfavorable war situation in North China and Northeast China has caused a large amount of floating capital and industrial equipment in Shanghai to flee south. The impact of the southward flight of floating capital on prices in this city is easier to express quickly. The intensity of this southward flight of capital can be seen in the recent sharp decline in the Hong Kong exchange rate over the past month.

Third, the increased need for trading chips due to the sharp rise in prices, which leads to a feeling of tight credit, is also an inevitable phenomenon. The above three are more lasting influences.

In addition to the above-mentioned longer-lasting factors that continued to have an impact, there were also more special factors last week that contributed to the continued stability of prices from the previous two weeks. These factors can also be listed separately as follows:

First, the possible success of the US loan in the short term. Therefore, when the market opened on Tuesday (Monday was Youth Day, and the market was closed for one day), Hua stocks fell sharply across the board, and 14 types of spot deliveries, such as Jingfu Zhongyi, hit the limit, and Yongsha fell below the 1.6 million yuan mark. On Saturday, newspapers in this city reported that Washington broadcast on the 2nd that the US House of Representatives passed the foreign aid bill amended by the Joint Committee tonight, which included 463 million yuan in aid to China. At this point, aid to China was finalized. However, it had already had a significant impact on prices in this city before it was finalized.

Second, the issuance of short-term treasury bills was proposed by Zhang Jia'ao, the president of the Central Bank, and was approved by the government. They are currently being printed and will be completed soon. Once the Legislative Yuan passes the issuance regulations, they can be sold on the market. It is expected to be realized around the end of this month. This is another factor that affects people's minds and makes them look at credit tightly and prices low.

Third, the second installment of the first series of US dollar bonds, the first installment of the second series, the second installment of the first series of US dollar treasury bills, and the first installment of the second series were all scheduled to begin repayment of principal and interest last Wednesday. There were rumors on the market that the government would lower the exchange rate to reduce government spending. To discerning people, this seemed like an unbelievable rumor, but it had a significant impact on the Hua stock market and the cloth market. This also shows how fragile people's minds are in the later stages of inflation and how susceptible they are to rumors!

Fourth, the sale of state-owned enterprises has long been decided by the government, but it has been delayed for a long time due to the time-consuming valuation procedures and the repeated discussions about the method of sale. However, it has recently become increasingly active, which has affected the market last week, making people look at credit tightly and at prices as soft.

Due to the influence of the above various reasons, prices in general continued the stable trend of the past two weeks last week. Since Tuesday, credit, which had been tight the previous week, has gradually become more relaxed due to the expansion of currency. By the weekend, it became more obvious, and shadow interest rates frequently tended to fall. On Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, food prices tended to fall due to reports of price drops in production areas. Edible oil, grains, and wheat flour all tended to fall, because the spring waters of the Yangtze River rose sharply, so Anhui grain could flow eastward smoothly, and banditry was not calmed in northern Jiangsu, so large quantities of food were transported south. Therefore, Wuxi—a food production area—had too much food, and prices fell sharply. The lowest price of Shangbai rice was 3.4 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), which had a great impact on this city. The initial opening price of cloth was mediocre. For example, on Tuesday, 42-count Blue Phoenix cloth fell into the 200 million yuan mark. However, on Wednesday, it went out of the 200 million yuan mark again because merchants from Tianjin and Hebei bought it at low prices. On Thursday, the municipal government announced the rationed price of rice for April. As a result, the rice market rebounded because the rationed price was higher than in March. Although cloth improved on Friday and Saturday, 42-count yarn still did not break the 200 million yuan mark, and the rice market did not see a rebound. The price of coal remained stable last week. For example, Jiao Zuo lump coal remained stable at 14 million yuan per ton. However, the Fuel Management Committee raised the price of rationed coal last week, and the government will make a final decision. Although there is no final decision on whether to increase it by 40% or 60%, the impact on the outlook for higher coal prices cannot be ignored. Other cigarettes and soaps were mostly lower than the price at the end of the previous week, but the average number for last week was still not lower compared to the previous week.

### Currency and Finance: Increased Currency Issuance Eases Credit, Ample Capital Drives Down Implicit Interest Rates

The tight money situation in the city, which had persisted for nearly half a month, reached its end last week. This trend of money supply easing from tight conditions became increasingly apparent in the latter half of last week. Before Thursday, the market's implicit interest rates generally hovered between 3.15% and 3.45%, with the interest rates for securities firms' long and short positions also firmly holding at a high of 3.6%. However, by Friday, the implicit interest rates had fallen below 3%, and the interest rates outside the stock exchange had also dropped across the board, with long positions at 3.2% and short positions even lower at 2.4%. Securities arbitrage also decreased to 2.2%, a staggering 50% drop compared to the arbitrage rate of over 4% the previous week, demonstrating the relaxed cash position in the market.

Over the past week, commercial firms and banks generally saw a prevalence of long positions. Interbank lending was exceptionally scarce in the latter half of the week, and customer overdrafts, which had been tight for a long time, gradually started to open up. After Thursday, the cash that banks paid to the central bank each day was no more than 10 to 20 billion, indicating the substantial deposit reserves held by the banks. Exchange results after the 60th day showed that the outflows were larger on Tuesday and Wednesday, totaling over 800 billion, but the outflow decreased to 37.5 billion on Thursday, even less than the 50 billion outflow at the end of the previous week. Friday's exchange results even reversed the usual pattern of indirect exchange groups among banks, resulting in an inflow of over 70 billion, the first time in two months. It is feared that the money supply will become excessively loose for a while afterward, which seems unavoidable.

Several reasons account for the shift from tight to loose credit: First, the national treasury's expenditures were vast, making it impossible to curb inflation. For example, last Friday, the Central Bank issued four new types of customs gold certificates to supplement the inadequate amount of currency in circulation. Second, two issues of U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills matured. It is said that several hundred billion dollars flowed out of the country through national banks. Third, the market for commodities and general financial goods remained weak over the past week, with more sales than purchases, leading to ample capital and easing of credit in the market.

The exchange situation of national banks last week, excluding Monday's holiday without trading, showed a substantial inflow of 230.5 billion on Tuesday. However, on the other days, there were consistently large outflows. The outflows totaled over 600 billion from Wednesday to Friday. After deducting the commercial banks' fixed deposits in national banks, the net outflow from national banks in those three days amounted to over 1.1 trillion, greatly increasing the liquidity in the market. As for the inflow figures of foreign banks, they remained enormous over the past week. Excluding the holidays, the total inflow from Tuesday to Friday was 621.8 billion, subtly indicating that domestic capital is still fleeing the country in a steady stream.

Internal and External Exchange Rates

The benchmark exchange rate remained unchanged in the past week. The trend of Hong Kong telegraphic transfer rates was stable. On Tuesday, 100,000 French francs equaled HK$1.101, and on Friday, it decreased to HK$1.08, a fluctuation of HK$0.02-0.03. The market price of U.S. dollars in Hong Kong was HK$5.66 per U.S. dollar on Monday, increasing to HK$5.71 on Friday. The fluctuation between Hong Kong dollars and U.S. dollars is usually not drastic. The market price of gold in Hong Kong remained stable at HK$318.50 per tael of gold from Tuesday to Thursday, and then increased to HK$324 on Friday.

The Shanghai-Guangzhou exchange rate increased from 160 yuan per thousand yuan on Tuesday to 180 yuan on Wednesday, and then remained stable after Thursday. The Shanghai-Xiamen exchange rate tended to decrease over the past week, but it increased temporarily on Friday and then decreased again at the weekend. The Shanghai-Chongqing exchange rate increased to 70 yuan on Wednesday and then decreased successively, reaching 30 yuan at the weekend. The general decrease or stability of the Shanghai-Hankou exchange rate indicates that the funds in the city did not flow out to those exchange institutions at an accelerated pace last week. The Shanghai-Tianjin exchange rate remained stable at a discount of 50 yuan from Monday to Friday. However, it suddenly increased to par at the weekend, an exception amidst the general decline in exchange rates.

Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

Regarding the stock market last week, focusing on Chinese stocks, the shift from tight to loose credit was indeed a positive factor, but it was not enough to offset the negative news, such as the gradual concretion of the U.S. loan and its rapid passage through both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Although credit eased last week, the lingering effects of the tight situation that lasted for ten days had not completely dissipated. Additionally, external factors were weak, and other financial goods such as the Hong Kong exchange rate could not rally, so the market generally decreased compared to the end of the previous week, despite the repeated fluctuations during the week. For example, Wing On Company closed at 1790 yuan at the end of the previous week, while the closing price last week was 1655 yuan. The closing price of New Kwong Chong Spinning Mill at the end of last week was almost 20% lower than that of the previous week. Among them, China Silk Corporation closed at the daily limit increase last week, rising about 10% compared to the end of the previous week, which can be considered particularly fortunate. Generally speaking, although Chinese stocks were generally flat or weak last week, the overall trend is still optimistic, as could be seen in the market situation at the weekend.

Although the trend of foreign stocks also fluctuated over the past week, they had exceeded the previous week if comparing the end of the week to the end of the previous week, making the market situation slightly better than that of Chinese stocks. Among the stocks, Jardine Matheson’s strength stood out, rising about 8% at the end of last week compared to the end of the previous week. Generally speaking, it can also be expected to improve with the easing of credit in the future.

### Industrial and Commercial Developments: Raw Cotton Has Not Arrived, Unified Tax is Increased First

Regarding the solution to the raw cotton shortage, the China Textile Industries Corporation held a board meeting on the 27th of last month to discuss the issue. The conclusion was that to solve the raw cotton supply problem, in addition to intensifying the purchase of domestic cotton, preparations should also be made to order raw cotton from the U.S. aid program. In addition, the association believed that under the current domestic situation, the purchase of domestic cotton is extremely difficult, so exchanging foreign cotton for export yarn and cloth is also a good method. However, it is said that the government originally limited the export of yarn and cloth to 20% of the total national output. The China Textile Industries Corporation specially suggested that if necessary, the export of yarn and cloth could exceed the prescribed limit, requesting the government to relax the scale and approve it at its discretion. The above is the opinion of state-owned yarn factories, representing half of the official view. As for the private cotton textile industry association, it believes that the cotton textile industry is the leader of China's industries, and the government should urgently guide its development and enable it to increase production and directly export. However, due to the worsening situation after the victory and the inappropriate management policies, it has fallen into the current critical situation.

According to the person in charge of the industry, the management policy of yarn and cloth has been changed three times since the victory, but the effect is minimal. He further stated that the current national cotton textile industry does not oppose the method of unified purchase and sales, and commissioned spinning and weaving, but hopes that it can be thoroughly implemented to solve the raw material shortage of various factories. For this reason, cotton textile industry personnel are planning to improve the management of yarn and cloth, and sending representatives to consult with the government. However, the government's consistent strategy has always seemed to not only "support the development of the cotton textile industry," but also attempt to control, or even grasp, civilian materials. On the 27th of last month, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Bank authorities exchanged views on the production and sales of yarn and cloth and management policies for an hour. It is understood that they plan to set up a "Joint Yarn and Cloth Distribution Committee," affiliated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and composed of representatives from the Central Bank, the National Textile Federation, the China Textile Industries Corporation, and the six regional cotton textile associations. The committee will set up a business department with three groups: raw materials, export, and domestic sales. The raw materials group will be responsible for the unified purchase of domestic and foreign cotton, and distribute it to various factories according to proportions; the export group will specialize in the export of yarn and cloth, using part of the foreign exchange earned from exports to order foreign cotton and machinery materials, and providing the rest to the Central Bank; the domestic sales group will specialize in the distribution of yarn and cloth throughout the country, and all yarn produced by the factories must be submitted to the committee for allocation. If the committee can be established as scheduled, undoubtedly private textile manufacturers will be completely subordinate to this organization, that is to say, the authorities will completely grasp all the production, transportation, and sales materials and functions of this industrial sector.

Recently, regarding the supply of raw cotton, the person in charge of the Central Bank said that there is no shortage, because it is said that more than 80,000 bales of American cotton will arrive in Shanghai successively in about ten days, which is certainly good news. However, one wave has not subsided, another wave rises. Although the successive arrival of raw cotton has given the textile industry in the city a glimmer of hope, the law that profit tax must be prepaid six times, and the new regulation that the unified cotton yarn tax rate will be increased from 7% to 10% has given the textile industry an intractable problem. Regarding the case of pre-collecting six times the profit tax, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appealed to the authorities to find a way to remedy it, but the response was that it was difficult to do so. The six regional cotton textile associations decided on Wednesday of last week to reply to the tax bureau, submitting the difficulties and requesting a change of method. The city's 110 trade associations also jointly signed a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a change. How this problem will be solved probably depends on the relative strength of both sides.

As for the increase in the unified cotton yarn tax, the cotton textile industry strongly opposes it and issued a written statement, believing that the unified cotton yarn tax was originally levied ad valorem, so the tax paid on yarn prices also increased accordingly. If the tax rate is further increased, the already precarious textile industry will not be able to bear it. The National Textile Federation even telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the two ministries of finance and economics, submitting it to the National Government to reconsider the cotton yarn tax increase and withdraw the order. Therefore, whether the tax rate can be increased as scheduled, it is feared that there will be a heated dispute in the future.
