### President Chiang Concerned About the Participation of the Min and Youth Parties in the Government; Zhang Qun and Lei Zhen Arrive in Shanghai Successively for Negotiations

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] President Chiang is concerned about the participation of the Min and Youth Parties in the government. At 5:00 PM on the 17th, he summoned Chen Bu Lei and Lei Zhen, expressing earnestly that the policy of cooperation among the three parties in the constitutional government will not be changed. He hopes to negotiate with the Min and Youth Parties to participate in the government before the issue of legislators is resolved. Lei Zhen will travel to Shanghai by train on the night of the 17th to assist Zhang Qun in negotiating with the two parties.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] According to a reporter's investigation, the Kuomintang is determined to make every effort to negotiate on the issue of the participation of the Min and Youth Parties in the government in order to facilitate its success. The Kuomintang believes that at this critical moment, it is hoped that the Min and Youth Parties will prioritize the interests of the country and not make the resolution of the issue of legislators a prerequisite for participating in the government. They hope that while trying to resolve the issue of legislators, they can participate in the government first. The positions of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and Minister of Industry and Commerce, which will be held by the Youth Party, can be temporarily filled by suitable candidates before Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian arrive in Nanjing to assume their duties, so that this part of the government affairs will not be suspended for a long time. The positions of Vice President of the Examination Yuan and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, as well as members of the Examination Committee and Grand Justices, which are outside the Executive Yuan, are filled by the President, who recruits suitable candidates and submits them to the Control Yuan for approval. Their nature is different from the legislators who are selected through consultation, so they should not be confused with the issue of legislators. This opinion has been conveyed by the Kuomintang to the Min and Youth Parties, and it is hoped that the two parties will consider it in order to break the current deadlock.

[News from Our Newspaper] Zhang Qun and his wife arrived in Shanghai by special plane at 4:30 PM yesterday. Wu Guozhen, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jia'ao, Zhang Junmai, and others went to Longhua Airport to welcome them. At 7:00 PM, Zhang Jia'ao hosted a banquet for Zhang Qun at a restaurant in Hongqiao Township. Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Junmai were also present. Mayor Wu did not attend due to another appointment. It is understood that Zhang Qun's visit is entirely to resolve the deadlock over the number of legislators for the Min and Youth Parties. He must return to Nanjing within the next week to report on his mission. Zhang Qun exchanged preliminary views with Zhang Junmai yesterday and spoke with Zuo Shunsheng on the phone, arranging to make initial contact with the key figures of the Youth Party in Shanghai this morning.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The selection of candidates for Vice President of the Judicial Yuan and Vice President of the Examination Yuan will involve recruiting figures from the Min and Youth Parties. Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Control Yuan, visited Xu Fulin of the Social Democratic Party on the morning of the 17th to discuss this matter. Xu stated that the party's Central Standing Committee did not discuss this matter last week. Xu will take the night train to Shanghai on the 18th to attend the party's Central Standing Committee meeting this week. The issue of the vice presidents may be brought up for discussion. When asked about the selection of Grand Justices, Xu stated that the Kuomintang has not yet discussed it with them. If there are consultations, the party will be able to consider it.

### Zeng Qi's Speech and Remarks

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] Zeng Qi of the Youth Party issued a statement on the 17th, saying: "The Youth Party has decided to withdraw from the Executive Yuan because the issue of legislators has not been reasonably resolved. The party's propaganda department has already issued a statement to this effect, which is a natural and unavoidable move. This is because the number of legislators was agreed upon long ago, and after repeated consultations between the representatives of the two parties, it was reduced from 80 to 41, but there is still no prospect of its realization. The 30 names proposed for joint signature are also unattainable. How can a political party with 25 years of history attend meetings with only a handful of people? Since it cannot attend the Legislative Yuan, it is inconvenient to participate in the Executive Yuan, let alone issues such as the Examination Yuan and the Judicial Yuan. It is rumored that I will head one of the Yuan. The President has indeed directly and indirectly sought my consent in the past. Because the issue of legislators has not been resolved and my health has not recovered, I still ask the President to select other capable people. My thoughts can be seen in the following words: 'Constitutional government is completed, the original intention is achieved, I will roast taro in Hengshan to take care of my sick body, and fish in Yanlai to fulfill my long-cherished wishes.' I am now hearing that Zhang Qun is going to Shanghai to mediate, and the outcome is difficult to predict. I hope that all parties can understand our party's withdrawal from the government and not be too surprised. It should be known that in a constitutional country, there is also the matter of one party governing. If the Kuomintang feels that its past achievements are very satisfactory and can cope with the current crisis alone, then it can resolutely take full responsibility for it, and we will be happy to see it succeed and will only assist from the sidelines, and will never hinder it. However, one thing must be noted: there is only one party that can take over the cabinet, but there is no parliament that can be taken over by one party. This is related to the constitutional system and the focus of domestic and foreign observation, so it should still be considered."

### President Chiang Persuades Zhang Boling to Head the Examination Yuan; He May No Longer Decline

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The President intends to nominate Zhang Boling as the President of the Examination Yuan, which has been approved by the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee.

### Legislative Yuan's Finance and Banking Committee Discusses the Temporary Property Tax Bill; Discussion on the Tax Threshold and Valuation Method to Continue Tomorrow

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Banking Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, convened by Committee Chairman Jian Guansan, to review the temporary property tax bill proposed by Liu Butong. The legislative principles were discussed first, and it was decided that: (1) the name would remain the original "Temporary Property Tax"; (2) the purpose of collecting this tax is, ideally, to equalize social wealth, and practically, to adapt to the needs of war and increase reasonable sources of revenue; (3) in addition to natural persons, all legal persons should, in principle, be subject to the tax, but methods of reduction, exemption, and preferential treatment should be determined according to their nature. After the Chairman raised this point, it sparked fierce debate. Some argued that legal persons should be treated the same as natural persons, being subject to the tax across the board, while others argued that legal persons should not be subject to the tax at all. The two sides argued for more than an hour before deciding on this principle. The committee is scheduled to meet again on the 19th to discuss issues such as the tax threshold and valuation method for the temporary property tax.

### Control Yuan Seriously Discusses the Supervisory Law; Right of Consent Listed in Separate Regulations; Plenary Review Session to Continue Today

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The fourth meeting of the Control Yuan was held at 9:25 AM on the 17th, with 128 members present, chaired by President Yu. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the third meeting, the agenda items were discussed. First, the draft Supervisory Law prepared by the drafting committee of the Supervisory Law was submitted for discussion. After Lu Chao reported on the review and passage by the drafting committee, speakers were very enthusiastic, all focusing on the opinions on the right of consent. Some believed that it should be listed in separate regulations and not included in the Supervisory Law; others believed that the four powers should be listed together and should be included in the Supervisory Law, with some textual revisions. After further discussion, it was decided to form a plenary review committee to conduct a repeat review and scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM. Then, the regulations on the organization of the Inspection Committee's Executive Office were discussed. There were a total of two cases, the draft and the regulations of the former Control Yuan. In addition, there was a proposal by Zhao Guangchen, Hao Yulin, and 40 others, which was also related to the issue of the Executive Office: "Please establish the basic principles of the organization of the Executive Office of the Inspection Committee of this Yuan to maximize the effectiveness of the exercise of supervisory power." Zhao Guangchen explained the main points of the proposal, and due to time constraints, the meeting was adjourned. Another drafting committee was formed to merge the organizational laws of the various committees and the regulations on the organization of the Executive Office of the Inspection Committee and hand them over to the drafting committee for discussion.

At around 3:00 PM, the Control Yuan held a plenary committee review meeting, with 74 members present, chaired by Tian Jiongjin. No results were obtained today, and it was decided to continue the plenary review session on the morning of the 18th. At the beginning of the discussion on the 17th, the issue of whether to include the right of consent still sparked fierce debate. Ni Bi was the strongest advocate for inclusion. He believed that the right of consent is one of the powers in the Supervisory Law, so it must be included in the Supervisory Law. However, most people advocated drafting separate rules for its exercise, believing that the right of consent is not a supervisory power but a parliamentary power, and it is not a power of prior supervision. This is because this kind of right of consent only extends to a small portion of officials stipulated by the Constitution, and not to all officials. Since the right of consent does not belong to one of the supervisory powers, it should not be included. After a vote, the majority still agreed not to include it and to draft separate rules for its exercise. Then, the issue of dividing the Supervisory Law into chapters was discussed. The result was (1) General Provisions, (2) Correction, (3) Examinations, (4) Impeachment, (5) Investigation, (6) Supplementary Provisions. The word "power" was deleted from "power of correction". The discussion only reached the end of the second chapter today and the meeting was adjourned. The unfinished parts were handed over to the plenary review session on the 18th for discussion. At the same time, five committee members, Lin Shizeng, Gu Fengxiang, Huang Jue, Zhu Weiqi, and Tian Jiongjin, were appointed to organize the chapters and articles of each chapter and the first chapter of general provisions, and to draft the draft rules for the exercise of the right of consent.

Editorial

### Criticism of Japan's [Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan]

The U.S. government's request to Congress for an appropriation of $150 million to implement the Japan, Korea, and Ryukyu plan was rejected by the House of Representatives on the 3rd of this month. When this news reached Tokyo, officials felt unhappy, and the Japanese asked the Allied Headquarters: "Does this indicate a change in U.S. policy toward Japan?" Allied officials had to admit that without this appropriation, it would be tantamount to removing the foundation of Japan's "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan." Although this decision by the U.S. House of Representatives is a major blow to Japan's economic recovery plan, it cannot completely dismantle Japan's entire recovery plan.

Japan's "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan" was announced by the Economic Recovery Planning Council on May 17, one day earlier than the publication of the Clayton Report. After the announcement of Japan's recovery plan, American public opinion immediately supported it. Later, British Foreign Office official Taining inquired about the truth of American policy toward Japan, and American public opinion remained silent for some time to avoid being driven by the British Commonwealth countries. However, Under Secretary of the Army Clayton said on May 26, "Japan has begun its economic recovery, but the task is heavy and the road is long, and it cannot be achieved in one fell swoop... To ensure the success of this plan, Japan must tighten its belt even more than before, and American aid should not be rushed." The appropriation bill requested by the U.S. government from Congress was submitted by the Department of the Army. The $150 million was the initial appropriation, and the total figure was $675 million. According to the original plan, of the $150 million, $110 million would be provided to Japan to purchase raw materials, machinery, leather, coking coal, and other important commodities, all of which are necessary industrial raw materials for Japan's recovery plan. If Japan obtains this batch of raw materials, the foundation for the recovery plan will be laid, and the stagnant Japanese industry will immediately become active. The doubts felt by various countries in the Far East about the U.S. policy of supporting Japan can be attributed to this threat.

According to Japan's "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan," it is a draft made by the Economic Security Headquarters. From the Katayama Cabinet to the Ashida Cabinet, it took nine months to study and draft this plan. As the "Asahi Shimbun" in Tokyo said on May 18, "Government officials and representatives of capitalists account for the overwhelming majority, scholars are just nominal, and there are only two representatives from labor unions." This clearly shows the interests represented by this plan. The content of this plan is divided into eight items: "Economic Recovery Goals," "Industry and Mining," "Food," "Trade," "Transportation," "Reconstruction," "Employment," and "National Income." The goal of economic recovery is to achieve the living standards of 1930-34 in 1952 and the level of Japanese industry that can maintain this living standard. According to this plan, in 1952, the Japanese population will increase by 25% compared with the pre-war period, reaching 82,932,000 people. Therefore, the industrial production required by the five-year plan must adapt to the living standards of 83 million people and ensure their stability and health. Therefore, the living standards and industrial levels planned to be completed in 1952 are as follows:

Morning Forest Fisheries Production

Living Standard

Personal consumption expenditure (per person per year) 116.0 yen

Food (per person per day) 2,211 calories

Clothing (per person per year) 7.4 pounds

Note: The amounts and amount indexes in this table are based on the average prices of 1930-34.

According to the above table, taking coal and copper ingots, the main sectors of heavy industry, as examples, the target for 1952 is 141% for both coal and steel ingots. The reason for this is that the Japanese population in 1952 will increase compared with the population in 1930-34; the increase in population naturally expands the living standards. Even if the estimated increase in population in 1952 in this plan is not exaggerated, in fact, compared with the average of 1930 (64,450,005 people) and 1935 (69,254,148 people), the increase of 6,852,076 people is only about 124%, not reaching the ratio of 141%. Taking the overall industrial and mining production target, as shown in the previous table, the percentage of 1930-34 is 130%, which also greatly exceeds the ratio required for the assumed population in 1952. This means that the industrial and mining industries, which once served as the material basis for Japanese aggression, have already exceeded the level of Japanese industrial and mining industries in 1930-34 in this plan. The development of high industrial levels is not limited to this. According to Shozo Mizutani, Minister of Commerce and Industry, "If the Clayton Plan is adopted, most of Japan's heavy industry and power equipment can be retained. Therefore, all production targets in the Japanese government's original five-year plan can be completed within four years. The Japanese government must thoroughly revise its original economic recovery plan and raise all production targets to a higher level."

Observing Japanese public opinion in the past week, if the U.S. Congress approves the loan to Japan, this "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan" will not only be implemented smoothly, but may even be revised, and it will develop to a level without boundaries. Unexpectedly, the U.S. House of Representatives ruled against appropriating funds for Japan, which, in the eyes of the Japanese government, was like a bolt from the blue, blowing the Ashida Cabinet and the "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan" from the sky to the ground. However, the plan that has fallen can still stand up and rise again. As Clayton said, the implementation of Japan's recovery plan is "a heavy task and a long road," and it is necessary to "tighten its belt even more than before" to ensure the success of the plan. Clayton's care for Japan can be described as meticulous, which is indeed completely in line with the situation of the Japanese people's arduous struggle. In short, today's Japan is learning the spirit of King Goujian of Yue, "Do not eat what one has not planted, do not wear what one's wife has not woven, do not collect from the country for ten years, and the people have three years of food." (Guoyu Yueyu Shang) The implementation of the recovery plan has begun. The "U.S. aid" is only a temporary setback, and does not completely dismantle its existence. Its existence and development still pose a great threat to various countries in the Far East. To eliminate this threat, the Far Eastern Commission must take effective steps to cancel Japan's "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan"!

### Fire at Zhenjiang Oil Refinery Burns Tung Oil, Firefighters Bravely Fight the Fire, Causing 21 Deaths and Injuries

### Qingdao's Frenzied Conscription: Citizens Become Birds of Fright, Three Offenders Executed on the Spot, Lungs Spilling Out

[Our Newspaper Qingdao Fourteenth Dispatch] For a municipality directly under the central government like Qingdao, armed conscription has occurred consecutively within ten days, which is truly appalling! On the evenings of the third and fourth, many merchants and coolies were arrested in the Dongzhen area. The number of people was counted by trucks, loaded onto China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyou and Haigui ships, and sailed away one after another, destination unknown. Those who attempted to escape were beaten to death in the sea. This was the initial news the reporter received. At that time, there was a scene of families collectively wailing at the docks. Subsequently, various lawless soldiers continued to arrest people, claiming to be capturing deserters. "The atmosphere in the city is filled with fear, with everyone on edge. Few people are seen in remote alleys at night, and even during the day, people are wary of armed soldiers." On the evening of the ninth, a woman was beaten to death for trying to rescue her arrested husband. On the evening of the eleventh, people were also arrested in the downtown area near the Huale Theater, and it was rumored that more people were beaten to death.

From 11:00 AM on the twelfth, "the sound of conscription spread throughout the city." Qingdao citizens were like hearing the sound of air raid sirens. "Shops closed, vendors packed up, and the order around the Sanlu Market, Jinan Road, Beiping Road, and Licun Road areas was extremely chaotic. People fled in all directions as if facing a formidable enemy." Afterwards, officials claimed it was a misunderstanding. The reporter witnessed the chaotic situation at that time, filled with an atmosphere of fear and violence. The good words of discipline and order, which people had always been accustomed to hearing, were completely bankrupt. The wife of a Mr. So-and-so, a telegraph operator from an official news agency, was holding her baby and riding in a rickshaw passing through the intersection of Market Road when the rickshaw puller, upon hearing the news, hurriedly abandoned the rickshaw and fled, causing the rickshaw to overturn and the baby to cry out and die. A local newspaper said that this "seemed to be a state of anarchy." A newspaper headline read: "The authorities cannot shirk their supervisory responsibility; the Shandong compatriots are too honest." This is indeed the truth. Furthermore, it plainly stated that the conscription incidents "started last winter and have not stopped to this day."

The authorities are simply thinking about the government's prestige and reputation, emphasizing it repeatedly. One explanation is that they had not received reports, and another is that wicked people were spreading rumors. However, the uproar is undoubtedly a blatant fact. The Pacification Zone Headquarters, on the one hand, ordered the police and detectives to strictly prohibit and investigate, and on the other hand, dispatched cadres to supervise and lead inspectors to secretly arrest people everywhere. On the morning of the thirteenth, only three minor conscription offenders, Cao Yungui, Fei Yuanze, and Wang Zengfu, were found at the Xiaogang Trading Market and the Dongzhen Assembly Factory. They were all soldiers from the Seventh Brigade of the Fifty-fourth Division and were executed on the spot. One bullet entered from the back, immediately causing the chest to explode open and the lungs to spill out.

The Pacification Zone said that the division commander and brigade commander would also be severely punished. It is believed that this statement can "serve as a warning to others."

Many places in Qingdao are unique. Just speaking of prices, apart from the special zone, it is the highest in the country. The people were already gasping for breath under high pressure, and their hearts were restless. The sound of gunfire in the city is a common occurrence. If there are exercises, the sound of cannons will be heard, rumbling incessantly, which is not surprising. But this kind of turmoil in an "anarchic state" is truly unbearable.

The reasons for conscription: Some say that it is because the source of soldiers is insufficient, and the troops cannot rely entirely on recruitment to replenish their numbers, so the conscription is justified. Some say that it is because they have to deal with inspections, so they have to take emergency measures to make up for the vacancies that have always been embezzled, and they have their difficulties. Some say that this is a way for individual unscrupulous soldiers to make money, and it is vividly rumored that the market price for releasing one conscript is 10 million legal tender, and for ten conscripts, it is a small silver ingot.

By the thirteenth, the City Council also had two solutions: (1) Request the authorities to release the conscripted men and demand guarantees in the future. (2) The families of the conscripted men should register quickly so that people can be claimed according to the list. From today onwards, the city is obviously much more stable. The impression of the large-scale conscription incident last winter is still very deep in the minds of the citizens. After several twists and turns, the arrested people were gradually released from Yantai and returned. Li Mi, the commander of the Eighth Army, issued a notice stating "Those who disturb the people will be killed," and the "conscription offenders" (this is a new term) were also punished. But now they are still arresting people back and forth, and the citizens have become birds of fright. "The Shandong compatriots are too honest," where is the guarantee?

### French Parliament Approves Six-Nation West Germany Agreement by a Margin of Fourteen Votes, Tasking the Government to Ensure France Obtains Security Guarantees

[Reuters Paris Seventeenth Dispatch] The French National Assembly this morning passed a resolution approving the recommendations of the London Six-Nation Conference, establishing a West German Constituent Assembly, and regulating the distribution of industrial products in the Ruhr, with 300 votes in favor and 286 against. In addition to authorizing the government to participate in the implementation of the London Conference recommendations, the resolution put forward by the majority party also asks the government to do its best to negotiate with the Western Allies so that some points in France's original proposal that were not adopted by the London Conference can be recognized by the Western Allies. The resolution recognizes that the recommendations of the London Conference show that the position repeatedly stated by Britain and the United States to France has been affirmed and approached, but some important points in the French proposal have not yet been adopted. The resolution also recognizes that if France refuses the resolutions of the London Conference, it will cause regrettable slack in the cooperation between friendly countries, and this continuous cooperation is the most reliable guarantee for peace today. The second part of the resolution tasks the government to report to Parliament immediately if it discovers any decisions that violate the following principles: (1) The internationalization of the Ruhr mines and basic industries. (2) Compensation obtained from Germany, and the methods should pay special attention to the extension of the period of military occupation of Germany, and the clear stipulation in the contract of the conditions for the withdrawal of Allied forces from Germany. (4) Eliminating the danger of the revival of any totalitarian Germany. (5) Continuing to explore the possibility of reaching an agreement on the German issue among the four powers. (6) Intensifying efforts to promote the economic and political recovery of Europe.

Before the vote, Prime Minister Schuman addressed the Foreign Minister Bidault, pointing out that German bandits cannot become a force for the rejuvenation of Europe, and are an economic burden on the Allied countries. France deeply understands this difficulty of the Allied countries, and the Germans themselves are deeply disturbed, so the delay in the solution will not help. The German people, who have lost their initiative and responsibility, must be reorganized. The National Assembly's approval of the London Conference resolution does not mean that the government's foreign policy, including close participation in the Western Union and the Marshall Plan, has been agreed to by the National Assembly. However, the extremely close number of votes between those who opposed and those who supported it shows that most French people are still afraid that before the Western European alliance can fully exert its effectiveness and France's defense strength can be newly established, Germany will be able to fully restore its vitality.

[Reuters Paris Sixteenth Dispatch] Foreign Minister Bidault today defended the Six-Nation proposal on Germany again in the National Assembly debate. He said, "In history, I don't know of a more effective control than the recommendations of the London Conference." He also announced that France has already decided to agree to the German currency reform, because without it, the French-occupied area of Germany will inevitably be suffocated. He emphasized that if France only refuses the recommendations of the London Conference without proposing other solutions, its seriousness cannot be ignored. He is convinced that France has no other way to go except to accept the recommendation.

### Soviet and Western Allied Officials Discuss German Currency Reform Issues, Soviet Union Issues Order to Strengthen Border Control

[Reuters Berlin Sixteenth Dispatch] German officials in close contact with the Soviet military government confirmed that Soviet officials had met with Western Allied officials to discuss the Soviet Union's participation in the entire German currency reform issue. This discussion was purely exploratory, so no important officials from the four powers participated. These negotiations have been going on in Berlin for two days. Although they are called Allied negotiations, an official from the Berlin Municipal Government said that this is a negotiation between Soviet and American officials. If the discussions make progress, the Berlin Allied Control Council is expected to resume its meeting on June 20 to discuss national currency reform. The German side also said that the Soviet side has expressed its willingness to make some concessions if appropriate guarantees can be made. If the current chairman of the Allied Control Council, French Commander-in-Chief Koenig, prepares to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council next Monday, the Soviet Union is also willing to attend the meeting. Otherwise, the Soviet Union will not object to convening a meeting of the Financial Committee under the Allied Control Council to discuss the issue of currency reform.

[Reuters London Seventeenth Dispatch] It is reported that the implementation of the West German currency reform is imminent. Berlin is not within the scope of implementation. At the same time, the Soviet occupying authorities also issued an order today announcing that Germans holding permits issued by the Western Allied authorities are prohibited from entering the Soviet occupation zone to prevent the use of inter-zone permits for illegal activities.

### Bevin Explains the Ruhr Issue

[Reuters London Sixteenth Dispatch] Foreign Minister Bevin stated in the Lower House on the sixteenth in response to inquiries from parliamentarians that the British government's policy is to never allow the Ruhr area's coal mines to be owned by their original owners. The resolution of the four powers is that the Ruhr coal mine issue must be handled by the German people. Based on past experience, it is difficult to expect the best results if foreigners operate coal mines. In response to another member's question about what attitude German political parties take towards the issue of state-owned West German enterprises, Bevin replied that there are those who oppose and those who support it among German political parties. The Social Democrats and Communists expressed their support, while the Free Democrats and the German Party both expressed their opposition. The Christian Democrats support changing major industries to public-private ownership. The British government hopes that German political parties will announce their opinions to the German people when the issue is decided.

Soviet representative Gromyko spoke for an hour, attacking the US program as a tool of "war-mongering" conspiracies.

[Reuters Berlin Seventeenth Dispatch] The Soviet representative abruptly left the meeting of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command yesterday, ending the only remaining joint cooperation mechanism of the four powers in Germany. British and American headquarters frankly admitted that the joint control of Berlin and Germany by the four powers has been declared dead and may not be revived again. While admitting the extreme seriousness of the situation, a British spokesperson said that it is currently too early to speculate whether the Soviet Union's actions will be the final breakdown of the four-power joint control.

After the Joint Command meeting lasted for thirteen hours yesterday, US representative Howley asked the chairman, the French representative, for permission to leave first due to excessive fatigue. Unexpectedly, the entire Soviet delegation left at this time without explaining the reason or apologizing to the chairman. The chairman had no choice but to adjourn the meeting without setting a date for the next meeting. The chairman also stated that his adjournment was due to the entire Soviet delegation leaving, not Howley's departure first. Howley later stated that he believed this was the end of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command. However, he also stated that if one thinks that Britain, the United States, and France will be expelled from Berlin, then Britain, the United States, and France do not think so. Howley pointed out that considerable progress had already been made at yesterday's meeting, and he thought that the Soviet side must have deliberately created a serious situation to do this. The cooperation of the four powers has apparently been terminated in a very Russian way. Howley then solemnly stated that, from the perspective of the Western Allies, the Berlin Allied government has not ended due to the Soviet Union's actions. The joint management of the four powers may not be able to continue to be implemented, but the United States military government will continue to perform its obligations, especially the task of supplying food to the American military district.

### Poland Demands a Meeting of the Four-Power Allied Control Council

[Agence France-Presse Warsaw Sixteenth Dispatch] The Polish government believes that it is currently necessary to immediately convene a meeting of the Berlin Four-Power Allied Control Council to discuss the London Six-Nation Agreement. In a note to the Allied Control Council, the head of its military delegation in Germany stated that if the Allied Control Council agrees, Poland is willing to express its opinions at the meeting.

[United Press Berlin Seventeenth Dispatch] Observers here say that Poland's request for France to convene the Allied Control Council is because the Soviet Union hopes that the council can play its role again. The council has been adjourned since March 20 of this year when the Soviet commander announced his withdrawal.

### French Labor Unrest Spreads, 250,000 Workers Strike in Belgium

[United Press Paris Seventeenth Dispatch] Labor unrest has struck more than 25 cities, and as of tonight, the number of strikers has reached 100,000. Four thousand railway workers in Villeneuve, only ten miles from Paris, launched a thirty-minute strike last night to express their sympathy for the rubber workers.

[United Press Clermont-Ferrand, France Seventeenth Dispatch] The local police station and the strikers reached a truce agreement on the seventeenth, ending the bloody battle.

[Agence France-Presse Paris Sixteenth Dispatch] Communist members of parliament have submitted a motion in parliament requesting that the forced plan against strikers be stopped. The left-wing French Labor Confederation has also announced its full support for the strikers in Clermont-Ferrand. The dissenting union stated that it did not preside over the strike because it opposed increasing wages and advocated reducing prices. [United Press Brussels Sixteenth Dispatch] Approximately 250,000 steel and metal workers in Belgium went on strike today, demanding a 5% increase in wages. Employers rejected this request, but negotiations are still ongoing.

### Eight Countries, Including the UK and France, in the Far Eastern Commission Agree on Japan's Industrial Level, the US Strenuously Opposes and Still Advocates Raising It

[United Press Washington Sixteenth Dispatch] The United Kingdom, France, the Philippines, India, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Canada, eight countries of the Far Eastern Commission, agreed on Japan's industrial level today, but the United States still strenuously opposed it, and China and the Soviet Union also disagreed. As of now, the situation is very deadlocked, and it may be difficult to reach a final agreement. According to the intentions of the eight countries, Japan's industrial level should be lower than that stipulated in the Strike Report, while the United States advocates raising it to help Japan accelerate its recovery. Some committee members believe that this is the most important issue currently facing the committee. Another issue is the return of Japanese military looted materials found within Japan to their owners, which China is most concerned about. It is heard that China and the United States are conducting direct negotiations.

### Soviet and Australian Officials Comment on the US Supporting Japan

[United Press Washington Sixteenth Dispatch] A Soviet official involved in Far Eastern affairs claimed on the sixteenth that the United States is deliberately delaying the peace treaty with Japan in order to buy time and build a high-level Japanese industry. Although Soviet representatives have not formally made this statement in the Far Eastern Commission, they often reveal this sentiment in informal conversations with some members of the Far Eastern Commission. Soviet officials told United Press that, according to their observations, the US attitude toward Japan is almost like the attitude of the United Kingdom toward Germany before the last world war. They said: The United Kingdom at that time willingly tolerated Germany's rearmament plan because it believed that Germany would never attack Western countries, but would use it to attack the Soviet Union to the east. Now the United States also seems to believe deeply that the revived Japan will never be enough to threaten the United States' position in the Pacific, but will be a threat to the Soviet Union's Far East.

[United Press Canberra Sixteenth Dispatch] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt said in the Lower House today in response to criticism of his foreign policy from opposition members that the United States' restoration of Japan is largely a side effect of the tension in US-Soviet relations. The United States agreed two years ago that Japan should not have wartime industries, but this policy has now changed. Japan may be an important factor in a future US-Soviet conflict, but the new US policy may pose a threat to countries in the Pacific such as Australia, just like the policy after World War I, which posed a threat to democracy in Germany. The countries not listed in the Far Eastern Commission also share the same view.

### Hong Kong Chinese Merchants to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Boycott Dumping of Japanese Goods

[Agence France-Presse Hong Kong Seventeenth Dispatch] The sales of Japanese goods in Hong Kong have a rather bleak future if Hong Kong Chinese merchants unanimously boycott them. The Chinese Manufacturers' Association requested the authorities several weeks ago to convene a general meeting of all sectors to establish a Southeast Asian boycott Japanese goods group. The Hong Kong government, deeply afraid that this movement would develop into an anti-American movement, stated that this meeting could only be allowed to be convened on the condition that anti-American words were not used, and political speeches were not allowed to be delivered. The Chinese Manufacturers' Association accepted these conditions and decided to hold the first organized protest meeting in Hong Kong against the dumping of Japanese goods in Southeast Asia on the nineteenth. The threat of Japanese goods competition has already affected the Hong Kong textile industry. So far, Shanghai funds flowing into Hong Kong that were prepared to be invested in industry have stopped. Chinese textile manufacturers who moved here from Shanghai have already put their factory opening plans on hold and are engaged in commercial activities until the threat of Japanese goods competition is reduced before making plans.

This morning at 10:00 AM, representatives from all sectors of Shanghai will hold a reception ceremony. Mayor Wu, Mr. Ren, and Mr. Shifu will all participate. The American side will be represented by the Acting Consul General. The "Ji Guang" brought a total of 1,460 tons of rice. According to the contract signed on the 30th of last month, our country will receive 145,000 tons of American aid rice within the three months of June, July, and August of this year. The most pressing issue to be resolved is transportation. The China Merchants Bureau has designated seven or eight ships specifically for transporting the rice. In the future, one rice ship is expected to arrive every four to five days.

Additionally, the American vessel "Donald McKay," carrying 6,364 tons of American aid flour, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today.

Then, the Ministry of Food, in consultation with the committee, will allocate it as grain for the second phase of urban rationing. Whether grain rationing in various North China ports can uniformly switch to flour is currently undecided. However, the grain rationed in Tianjin and Beijing is already entirely flour.

### Unemployed Workers from Lun Chang Factory Petition the Bureau of Social Affairs for Reinstatement

[Our Own Correspondent] Representatives of over 30 unemployed workers from the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, known for its dyed Lun Chang floral fabrics, petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday. The British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Pudong suffered extensive damage to its machinery after the outbreak of the Pacific War. The Japanese then moved workers and machinery from the Gongda No. 2 Dyeing and Weaving Factory into the Lun Chang Factory to resume production. After the victory, the British company took over Lun Chang and laid off all the workers from the former Gongda factory, numbering over 400. The General Labor Union conducted two investigations, and the factory agreed to prioritize the reinstatement of unemployed workers when the need for more workers arose. The factory resumed production last November and hired new workers, but did not reinstate any of the former workers. Several days ago, over 400 unemployed workers surrounded the Lun Chang Factory, but were dispersed by the police. Yesterday, 30 representatives petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting reinstatement. The Bureau has scheduled a mediation session between labor and management today.

### Mayor Wu's Remarks on the Jiao Tong University Incident; Hopes Non-Professional Students Will Quickly Clarify Their Intentions; If They Continue to Delay, Public Interrogation Will Be Conducted

[Our Own Correspondent] Mayor Wu met with reporters in the Municipal Government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday, and made some remarks regarding the different positions of the Municipal Government and the university regarding the handling of the student anti-Japan demonstration, as stated by President Cheng of Jiao Tong University. He acknowledged that the positions of the Municipal Government and the university were indeed different. The university adopted an attitude of "leading with virtue, regulating with propriety," while the Municipal Government adopted "leading with governance, regulating with punishment." Although the policies are different, the goal is the same. The former is applied to the majority of good students and is for "pacifying the good," while the latter is aimed at a small number of professional students and is for "eliminating violence." Therefore, they are actually achieving the same goal through different routes and should complement each other.

Regarding the second letter that the Jiao Tong University Student Union sent to the Mayor yesterday, Mr. Wu said after reading it yesterday, "It's really fun." The questions raised repeatedly in the letter can be summarized as: "The student anti-Japan demonstration is a patriotic movement, why as the Mayor do you not cherish it but instead suppress it?" Mayor Wu has repeatedly clarified that the demonstration was not purely a patriotic movement, but in fact a conspiracy, so it must be thoroughly investigated.

As for the Student Union's request in the letter that students be allowed to observe the interrogation (original text: "You do not allow students to testify, are you afraid that they will speak their minds on the spot and expose your lies?"), it is considered pure nonsense. The Municipal Government does not allow students to observe the interrogation because it is afraid that the students will sing and disrupt the order of the meeting. As for the public procedures for the interrogation in the future, the Municipal Government has already planned it properly. If Jiao Tong University still does not respond within this week, then next week, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Education Association, the District Court Prosecutor's Office, the Police Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, and the presidents of all vocational colleges and above will be invited to hold a meeting to publicly discuss the procedures for interrogating and calling witnesses, and implement it after reaching a consensus.

Mayor Wu gave a final warning to the Jiao Tong University Student Union yesterday. He said: If you are not professional students, but purely patriotic youths, then you should quickly clarify your intentions to the 5 million citizens of the city and all the students of the school, and quickly answer the questions raised by the Municipal Government. He guarantees that it will be made public to society. Mayor Wu finally said: I would like to borrow a common phrase used by the Communist Party—"The eyes of the people are discerning." Let the citizens of the city judge the right and wrong of the student anti-Japan demonstration.

(8) How can the party, government, military, and people coordinate and cooperate to promote military service? (9) How should the allocation of land to soldiers (new recruits) be implemented in a practical and convenient manner?

(11) If the conscription process is changed to a system of gradual supplementation, with recruits moving up from the county self-defense forces to the security forces and then to the national army units, how can this be done effectively? The case has been distributed to various provincial and municipal governments, party headquarters, councils, headquarters of the pacification commissioners, general headquarters for the suppression of bandits, headquarters of the pacification zones, Zhengzhou and Hankou command posts, army headquarters, and Xuzhou command posts, requesting that they provide opinions based on current facts, gathering public opinion, and using an objective and candid attitude, and requesting a reply within two weeks of receiving the document.

The mayor should give priority to assigning the laid-off employees to emerging businesses or other business institutions. (2) Street names should not be changed lightly.

### Shanghai Rumor of a "Yang Sister" Unproven to Abstain from Food; Mysterious and Unclear Background to Undergo Physiological Examination

[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, a rumor has spread in this city that a "Shanghai Yang Sister," Zhang Dailin, comparable to the Chongqing Yang Sister who has abstained from food for nine years, has appeared. It is said that she has also abstained from food for five years. However, after inquiries from various sources by reporters, as of now, no one has been able to confirm this. Although she and the Chongqing Yang Sister have similarities in life and personality, there are also significant differences. The "Shanghai Yang Sister" has high breasts and a sunken abdomen, likes modern fashion, and loves cosmetics such as lipstick, rouge, eye shadow, and nail polish. She has long hair, but it is black in the front and red in the back, which is quite special. Her eyes are bright and sparkling. She graduated from the junior high school of Qingxin Middle School in Tianjin, can write beautiful penmanship, and loves music and trees. Her tone of voice is very low, which is similar to the Chongqing Yang Sister.

Contradictory Words

The reason why Zhang's abstention from food was discovered is that her husband, Zhang Pengfei, who has been married to her for three years and is currently a supervisor in the Jianghai area, revealed it to a friend who is a journalist during a conversation not long ago. Subsequently, the journalist introduced this "Shanghai Yang Sister" to her father, Huang Linshu (currently working as a specialist in the Social Affairs Bureau). According to Huang, he has known the "Shanghai Yang Sister" for a very short time. However, when they first met, Zhang called Huang her adopted father. After several days of contact, Huang expressed doubts about whether Zhang had any neurological abnormalities. Huang had inquired from Zhang how many years she had been in Shanghai, and she replied about ten years. When asked when she started abstaining from food, she replied that it was at the age of sixteen, when she was in Tianjin. However, Zhang is currently twenty-one years old, so her answers are contradictory.

Unsettled Residence

Another mysterious aspect of Zhang is that after marrying Zhang Pengfei, the two have never had a fixed residence. The night before last, Zhang was still staying at the Sanming Hotel near the Great World. As for her past background, it is also an incomprehensible mystery. Huang is now planning to have Zhang stay at his home starting today so that he can supervise her. Currently, both Huang and Zhang's couple are willing to hire a doctor to conduct a detailed physiological examination of Zhang.

Irritation When Seeing Food

Zhang went to Huang's residence for a meeting at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and did not leave until 9:00 p.m. According to Huang, during this day, she did not eat anything except for going to the toilet twice. When Huang and others were having a meal, she even showed a look of disgust. Zhang also told Huang that the reason for her abstaining from food is that she suspects that all meat is rotten. She used to like to eat vegetarian dishes, but after discovering a small worm on spinach once, she became deeply disgusted with it. Currently, she only eats a banana every two or three days.

### Tailor Molests Girl, Arrested

[Report from this Newspaper] Xue Fusheng, a native of Pudong, is currently twenty-nine years old and works as a tailor at the Huang's Western clothing store at No. 5 Dingji Lane, No. 116 Linsen Middle Road. Previously, on the night of the Dragon Boat Festival, at around 9:00 p.m., he raped Huang Anan, the nine-year-old daughter of the shop owner. The girl cried out in pain and fear. After the girl's mother, Huang Wei, sent her to the hospital for examination, it was found that the girl's hymen had been severely damaged. Huang Wei personally filed an oral complaint with the District Procuratorate yesterday afternoon. After questioning by Prosecutor Liang Gengshun, the bailiff was ordered to arrest Xue Fusheng.

### Joint Association of Charitable Organizations Asks for Reduction in Property Land Value Tax

The Shanghai Joint Association of Charitable Organizations, according to reports from its members, Renji Shantang and Guangyi 庄, stated that if the property tax for all of its units' foundation properties is paid according to the standard determined by the Standard Price Appraisal Council, the rental income will not be enough to cover the low-priced tax expenditure, and the burden will be increased, which will inevitably affect its own operations. Yesterday, it submitted a request to the Municipal Council, requesting that the Land Administration Bureau set another method for reducing or exempting the property land value tax for the properties of various charitable groups to assist and benefit the development of charitable undertakings.

### Two Fires; Gasoline Explosion Injures Workers; Six Houses Destroyed on Shanyin Road

[Report from this Newspaper] Six wooden houses near the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Sichuan Road, north of the Mobil Gas Station, which were engaged in repairing cars, patching tires, and electrical work, unexpectedly caught fire at around 8:55 a.m. yesterday due to a worker's carelessness. The fire spread to the stored gasoline barrels. In an instant, the gasoline caught fire, the iron barrels exploded, and sparks flew everywhere. Fortunately, the employees in the adjacent Longmao Warehouse used the three water hoses they had prepared to inject water from the upstairs windows, controlling the fire. The warehouse was spared. Subsequently, the Central Fire Department, upon hearing the news, dispatched several pump trucks to the scene for rescue, and the fire was extinguished in about an hour. A tire-patching worker, Chen Bingzhang, was burned on the spot and was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance. The police station in charge is sending officers to investigate the cause of the fire.

[Another Report] At the Sino-American Laundry Workshop at No. 81 Shanyin Road, at about 1:10 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out when coal ash fell into the xylol, piercing the roof and affecting the neighboring second floor of the Sino-American Barber Shop at No. 83, the residence at No. 79, and the Fuhe Rice Store at Nos. 77-75. The Fire Department dispatched vehicles to the scene and extinguished the fire in about an hour and a half. A total of six houses were burned down. After the incident, the cause of the fire was investigated by the police from the North Sichuan Road Police Station, who arrested and questioned the person responsible for the fire.

### Weng Zhong are Ornaments for Tomb Passages; Should Not Be Confused with Buddhism

The Shanghai Buddhist Youth Association submitted a statement to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating: "According to reports, the police bureau plans to demolish the stone Weng Zhong on the side of the racecourse in this city because ignorant citizens gather there every day to burn incense and worship, obstructing traffic. Some who do not understand Buddhist doctrines even claim to be followers of Buddhism and use the excuse of religious freedom to advocate for the preservation or construction of temples, etc. Recently, a citizen named Zhu Shanmin and others filed a complaint with the court, and their words even included the phrase 'What crime has my Buddha committed to deserve this destruction?' (as reported in the newspaper on the 11th of this month), which is even more absurd. Our association, as a Buddhist youth group, is responsible for promoting Buddhist teachings. The Weng Zhong have originally been ornaments for tomb passages since the Han Dynasty and have absolutely no relationship with Buddhism. Now, ignorant people are confusing the Weng Zhong with Buddhism, which is inevitably misleading and insulting to Buddhism. The members of our association cannot remain silent and have made this statement to clarify the matter and call on society to correct its understanding."

### Bloodshed on Fuzhou Road; Two Gangs of Hoodlums Fighting; Stray Bullet Kills Passerby

[Report from this Newspaper] At around 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Sutai Hostel on Fuzhou Road, two gangs of hoodlums, both equipped with axes, iron rulers, sharp knives, and other weapons, were about to start a brawl. This was discovered by Zhang Changgui, a member of the Criminal Investigation Division of the police bureau, who went there alone. In room 225 of the hostel, opened by Wang Keqin from Chuansha, the police saw that Keqin had already been stabbed in the head by another person surnamed Wang from the opposing gang. Zhang immediately arrested the assailant surnamed Wang. When he was taking him out of the alley entrance, unexpectedly, five or six more hoodlums came and surrounded Zhang and the others. Soon after, someone grabbed a low stool from a shoe-shining stall and struck Zhang in the back of the head, and several people punched him in the back. Before long, they scattered to the east. At that time, although Zhang was injured, he still chased after them. When he reached the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Hubei Road, at the entrance of Xiaoguanghan, the group of hoodlums pulled out firearms and fired shots while fleeing. About five or six shots were fired. A passerby, Lin Rongquan (native of Changzhou), was hit by a stray bullet at the entrance of Xinghuacun at No. 126 Hubei Road. The bullet entered his right chest and exited his back, and he fell to the ground, barely breathing. At the same time, a glass window at Dasheng Hang at No. 142 was also pierced with a hole. The injured person was rushed to Renji Hospital by ambulance, but he died of his injuries in less than ten minutes. Officer Zhang Changgui was taken to the Police Hospital for treatment.

### Public Sentiment Turns Weary, Sellers Consider Offloading; Rice Prices Show Slight Decline; Flour Initially Weak, Then Firm, Oil Market Rises Sharply

The rice market declined because the tin market fell the previous day, so public sentiment has turned weary. In addition, with other commodity prices falling on the previous day, the rice market also felt that it was difficult to stand its ground. Therefore, at the opening of the morning market, sellers were very eager to sell. Medium and lower grades of japonica and indica rice were widely available on the market, but high-grade white japonica and thin paddy rice were not yet seen. Prices fell by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan due to ample supply. Early rice and 秈 rice have retreated within the price limit, at 9.7 million. Mid-grade white 　 thin paddy rice were traded at 9.7 million each. The asking price for top-grade white japonica thin paddy rice outside the market retreated to 10 million.

The distribution of rice in the South market was poor, and the original quota of 3,000 shi was not sold out.

The flour market initially fell, but then rebounded. The Sheng market was affected by the reported drop in rice prices, and sellers continued to sell without stopping. Old car flour once fell to 3.17 million yuan, but then other commodity prices rose again, and the money supply loosened, so the northern faction took the opportunity to aggressively buy, and the market rose to 3.28 million yuan. The battleship rose from 3.15 million to 3.27 million yuan, resulting in a net drop of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng each rose 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Bran was flat, and the mill's bid for wheat remained at 4.7 million.

The coarse grains market initially continued the previous day's decline and saw further declines. Moreover, with the rice market trending downward, public sentiment was even more weary, and sellers were still eager to sell at high prices. Soybeans initially fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, but then turned firmer due to the rise in soybean cake and oil prices. Zha soybeans closed at 5.75 million, up 150,000 yuan. Corn fell by 400,000 yuan, but the asking price rose in the after-market, but no transaction was made. New silkworm and new yuan wheat fell by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Green beans were traded very rarely and also initially fell but then turned firmer. Red sorghum in the big market was 4.85 million yuan. Sesame fell by 500,000 yuan, but the asking price rose in the after-market, but no transaction was made. Raw peanuts opened last and rose by 500,000 yuan.

The edible oil market rebounded sharply, returning to the previous day's peak because the money supply was loose and small investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, and buying interest was very strong. Factories did not release much supply. Soybean oil rose the most. Datong soybean oil opened at 22.5 million yuan and closed at 24.2 million yuan. Dayou soybean oil closed at 24.3 million yuan, both seeing sharp increases of 2.3 million to 2.4 million yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose by 2 million.

### Credit Tightening Ineffective; Buying Enthusiasm for Domestic Stocks Rises Again; Yongsheng Yarn Closes Again at a High Price

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Regarding the Side Effects of Ebesal and its Usage

— Liang Junqing

Since Dr. Xu Jing published an article in this newspaper introducing the new treatment for tuberculosis, Ebesal, it immediately caught the attention of general tuberculosis patients, who sent letters to inquire in droves, almost overwhelming Dr. Xu. Although Dr. Xu has successively published two replies, the number of people inquiring has continued unabated. This shows how many people in our country suffer from tuberculosis and that its "absolute" treatment is unfortunately still being sought. Because I dragged a tail in Dr. Xu's article, saying that it has side effects and must be used by experts to avoid mistakes, the readers also focused their letters on inquiring about this. Therefore, I have no choice but to jump out and join in the fun, publishing this article, which I think will contribute to some extent to readers suffering from tuberculosis.

Indeed, Ebesal is very effective for tuberculosis, but it also has its side effects. As long as it is used correctly, it is very effective. If it is used incorrectly, then it is harmful. Therefore, I request that doctors who use it must thoroughly understand its nature before using it, otherwise it is better not to use it. In order to make readers understand the nature of Ebesal, I have to go around in a big circle and roughly describe all the methods of treating tuberculosis.

Since the German Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacillus, medical experts all over the world have been searching for its cure. At first, Koch advocated the use of tuberculin, believing that it could be 100% effective and cure diseases like smallpox vaccination or diphtheria serum. However, after clinical trials, the results were very disappointing. Not only was it ineffective, but it also caused many tuberculosis patients to worsen and die rapidly. Everyone became suspicious and fearful of tuberculin, warning each other not to try it. Therefore, they shifted their direction and sought other conceivable methods. For example, physical therapy such as bed rest, high mountain convalescence, sun lamp irradiation, climate change therapy; chemical therapy such as calcium therapy, arsenic therapy, iron therapy, silicon therapy, and iodine therapy; nutritional therapy such as vitamin therapy, improved nutrition therapy, reduced salt therapy; surgical therapy such as artificial pneumothorax therapy, rib resection therapy, phrenic nerve resection therapy; and bacteriological therapy such as tuberculin. B.C.G. streptomycin therapy, and so on. It encompasses everything and cannot be described in detail at one time. Although there are many good medicines among them, the shortcomings are also very many, and ultimately it cannot be regarded as a specific medicine for treating tuberculosis. Therefore, everyone gradually improved their treatment methods, dividing tuberculosis patients into two types, one acute and the other chronic. In the acute stage, it can be said that there were no other good methods except for bed rest and improved nutrition. Since the invention of streptomycin, everyone thought it was a specific medicine for tuberculosis, but it is effective in certain conditions, while in most cases it is still useless. Therefore, up to now, in acute tuberculosis, I still do not have an absolutely effective specific medicine for tuberculosis.

As for chronic tuberculosis, there is much room for discussion. Because its disease is chronic and the time can be prolonged, many medicines can cure it, and even without any medicine, as long as you rest quietly, you can cure it. However, which method should be used to treat it in order to be more confident? That requires our careful selection.

Originally, the treatment of chronic tuberculosis is not only a headache for our doctors, but also for the general patients who feel at a loss and do not know what to do. Why? Let me tell you.

I have already said in the previous article that after tuberculosis becomes chronic, the time can be prolonged, and any method can cure it, or even heal itself without medicine. But conversely, it can also be said that any method is ineffective. For example! At present, artificial pneumothorax is still considered a more reliable method for treating tuberculosis. However, its scope of application is not very large, and it can only be used in patients with early or subacute tuberculosis. In chronic tuberculosis, there is often pleural adhesion left over from pleurisy. At this time, artificial pneumothorax is absolutely impossible to use, otherwise there may be a risk of pleural hemorrhage, and in fact, after the pleura adheres, it is often impossible to inject air, so you have to give up. Therefore, Acobeaus proposed to use surgery or electrocautery to peel off the adhesion, and then inject air into the pleural cavity. Unfortunately, this method can only be used in a very small range of adaptation. In fact, it is often "this road is impassable." Subsequently, Brauer (my mentor) and Sauerbruch advocated the use of rib resection, so that the chest cavity lost its ability to support the chest after the rib resection, thus obtaining the same compressive effect as artificial pneumothorax. This method is theoretically very successful, and in fact, many people have recovered from it. However, many people either cannot tolerate this operation or are afraid to move forward, or fortunately the operation is safe, but the disease remains the same and does not see any effect. Therefore, everyone returned to calcium and vitamin BC to seek treatment. Honestly, if a chronic tuberculosis patient can inject a large amount of glucose calcium and vitamin BC for a long time, and at the same time can cooperate with bed rest, recuperation, and improved nutrition, then many patients can recover from it. However, in fact, there are also many people who treat it according to the above methods and do not see any effect. Therefore, everyone is looking forward to the arrival of new specific medicine for lung disease. Since the invention of streptomycin, everyone has placed great expectations on it. However, it also has many shortcomings: first, it is so expensive that patients below the middle class cannot afford it (the current market price is more than 8 million yuan per tube of national currency, plus injection fees, etc., it costs at least about 10 million yuan, and each tube can only be used for one day, and at least 100 or 150 consecutive injections are required to see the effect); second, its effect is not absolute (some tuberculosis patients have no effect after injecting a lot of streptomycin); third, it needs to be injected six times a day, continuously for 100 or 150 days, this continuous pain is really enough for patients to endure; fourth, it sometimes has side effects such as dizziness or tinnitus. With the above shortcomings and financial losses (at least more than 1 billion yuan), we can know that it is not an ideal specific medicine.

The "Ebesal" mentioned in this article is a copper preparation; it is used to treat tuberculosis because an Italian doctor inadvertently discovered the fact that "workers who work in copper utensils all year round rarely suffer from tuberculosis." At that time, a copper preparation such as Lekutyl was being sold and used. (To be continued)

### A Casual Discussion on Pharmaceutical Education (Part 2)

— Huang Mingju

To seek the development of pharmacy, there must be advanced research, and this kind of research must have a full-fledged pharmacy school to carry it out. On the one hand, it cultivates advanced pharmaceutical talents to establish the foundation of pharmaceutical education, and on the other hand, it engages in advanced research to start the development of the Chinese academic career. Talking about pharmaceutical research, it can be roughly divided into two ways, one is the research of chemical synthesis, and the other is the research of Chinese herbal medicine and its components. My country's transportation is not yet developed, and the production of medicinal materials is mostly concentrated in the northwest and southwest, while the supplies of scientific equipment are mostly circulated in the southeast. Therefore, at the beginning, the research on plant components should be in Southwest China, because of the convenience of obtaining materials and the suitability of planting. The research in chemistry should be established in East China and South China, because materials and talents are more concentrated. Once the transportation construction is completed, the research on chemical synthesis and plant components is suitable everywhere, regardless of geographical distinction. It is expected that at least ten pharmacy schools should be established within ten years. In the first five years, four should be established. One in Southwest China should be established in Xi'an, because it is close to Gansu, Xinjiang, Kang, and Tibet provinces, and the production of medicinal materials is very rich. One in East China should be established in Zhejiang, because the peaks of Tiantai and other peaks in the province, as well as the medicinal materials in Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, are all medicinal producing areas, and transportation is convenient and material transportation is easier. At the same time, the nine northeastern provinces and Taiwan should each establish one based on the existing pharmaceutical institutions in Japan. As for the pharmacy schools that should be gradually established in the second five years, there will be one in Nanjing, one in Hankou, one in Guangdong, one in Beiping, one in Chengdu, and one in Kunming. The above locations are either medicinal producing areas or convenient transportation, and materials are easy to collect. Once the number of talents increases, after ten years, it will be extended to every province to establish a pharmacy school, then the future pharmaceutical development will be very promising.

At present, the domestic situation regarding the use of pharmaceutical talents is extremely contradictory. On the one hand, it is said that there are not enough talents for many careers, whether in education, research, or law enforcement, all say that because there are no talents, they cannot start. On the other hand, the talents cultivated by various Chinese academic schools or pharmacy departments every year have problems with finding a way out, so many of them change careers. This is such a waste of talent. I believe that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health should conduct a strict investigation and statistics on pharmaceutical talents, and contact each other. At the same time, all pharmaceutical education, pharmaceutical business, laws, etc., must be immediately promoted and implemented. Talents cannot sit and wait for the promotion of the business, and the business should not wait for talents to start. Any attempt must be done to be hopeful. If you use the waiting method, you will never move, then you will never reach the goal. Moreover, there are businesses that need to be done urgently here, and talents are also here. Just use them and you can promote them. At the same time, the Pharmaceutical Society should also take responsibility for the use of pharmaceutical talents, engage in investigation, statistics, introduction, and assist the government in developing pharmaceutical education and promoting pharmacy.

At present, there are indeed very few pharmaceutical teachers, but it is not difficult to recruit teachers for two or three pharmacy schools, but it depends on how the government uses them. As far as we know, many pharmaceutical teachers are absorbed by foreign countries to do their pharmaceutical research, and even do research on Chinese medicine for them. This strange phenomenon is probably rare in the world. If the government can feel the real need for scientific nation-building, can feel the seriousness of the past and present drug shortage, can feel the urgent need to cultivate advanced pharmaceutical talents, can feel ashamed of pharmaceutical teachers being used to study Chinese medicine, resolutely promote the education of pharmacy schools, and provide generous treatment and sufficient equipment for these teachers, so that they can work in the country with peace of mind, I think these pharmaceutical teachers abroad all have national concepts, especially after the victory, all eagerly hope to return to their hometowns and serve the country. Who would be willing to live in a foreign country and work for others!

In summary, pharmaceutical education—pharmacy schools—is the source of all pharmaceutical careers. If the foundation is not eradicated, then everything will never be developed and flourish. What is there to talk about scientific nation-building? I hope that our education authorities will humbly accept our suggestions, and I hope that our pharmaceutical comrades will work together.

### A Record of Sending Mr. San Yuan's Coffin to Hangzhou for Burial

— Chen Yixian

Mr. Chen Sanyuan's coffin was transported from Tianjin to Shanghai by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xi Lin on June 15th, and then moved to the North Station. The Railway Bureau prepared a car, which was escorted to Huangni Ridge in Nanshan, Hangzhou by the three brothers Long Ke (Yan He), Fang Ke (Yan Tong), and Deng Ke on the 16th for burial. Yin Ke stayed in Tsinghua School in Beiping due to eye disease and could not come south. At 11:00 AM on the 15th, I, together with brothers Cang Qiu Weiming and Zhi An Bing Shu, went to the North Station to pay our respects. On Platform No. 3, we saw the words "Mr. Chen Sanyuan's Hearse" written in white cloth. The coffin was already in the car, and the coffin was covered with wreaths. After each person paid their respects, the Long Ke brothers invited us to rest in the flower car. Li Zubing, sent by the Ministry of Communications, also accompanied us to take care of everything, because the Minister of Communications Dawei is Mr. Sanyuan's son-in-law. Those who arrived on that day also included Li Bake, Chen Shutong, Ye Pusun and his son Congqi, Xia Jiancheng, Zhang Jusheng, Shen Kunshan, and Yuan Shinan.

More than 20 years ago, Mr. Sanyuan's wife was buried in Nanshan, Hangzhou. From her tomb, one could see a line of the Qiantang River, with sails clearly visible, and the scenery was excellent. At that time, I lived with my mother in the lake, and Mr. lived in Bai Chuan Road, Qixia Camp. I introduced Ma Zhuoqun to Mr. to discuss the purchase of land. Mr. Wang Bingshan determined the tomb and the mountain direction during the burial. He set two holes in the center, leaving the left one empty for Mr.'s grave. Heng Ke (Shizeng) was buried slightly below the main hole. Mr. passed away in Yaohua Hutong, Xicheng, Beiping before the Mid-Autumn Festival in August of the 26th year of the Republic of China. The coffin was parked in Changchun Temple for as long as 12 years. Now, in the autumn of the North China war, with traffic difficulties, he can actually be buried with his wife, all thanks to the efforts of Minister Yu of Communications.

When Mr. passed away, it was less than three months from the Japanese launching the July 7th Incident, and only one month from the Shanghai fire on August 13th. Reports stated that Mr. died of anorexia due to grief and indignation over current affairs. Mr., at the age of 85, was as passionate and enthusiastic as a youth, which is admirable and sad. Lu Fangweng's poem says, "When the king's army has pacified the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice." Two years ago, Japan surrendered, and Mr. never saw it in person, which is a pity.

Mr.'s poems are published by the Commercial Press. My friend Yuan Bokui has a copy of Mr.'s essays. After Brother Bokui passed away, Brother Chen Bingshu took the manuscript to arrange it. For ten years, the price of paper and typesetting has risen endlessly, and there is no money to publish it for the time being, so it has not yet met the world. Although Mr. supported himself in his later years by helping with writing, he would not do it if it was not the right person. Zeng Gong's letter to Ouyang Sheren on epitaphs said: "Those who have morality will not accept and inscribe for the wicked, and they can distinguish them among the people. People's actions have feelings of kindness but the traces are not, intentionally treacherous but externally virtuous, there is a great difference between good and evil that cannot be really pointed out, there is reality greater than reputation, and there is reputation more extravagant than reality. Just like employing people, if you do not have morality, how can you distinguish it without confusion and discuss it without favoritism? If you are not confused and not favored, then you are fair and right, but if the words are not well written, then the world will not spread it, and it is also necessary to have both literary talent." Guang Sheng's article can truly be worthy of this statement without shame.

Mr.'s death was due to the Japanese invaders. In his prime, he assisted his father, Mr. Chen Youming, in the Hunan Governor's Office. All the new policies in Hunan were planned by Mr. Later, he was dismissed from his post (principal of the Ministry of Officials) due to the Kang Liang case and never came out for life. He loved the country and the nation, but he had no ambition. His name was all over the world, but he had no fame. The ancient texts were above the Bao Run Xuan, but he did not serve as Yuan Shikai's senator. His poems were as famous as the Hai Cang Lou, but he did not serve as the prime minister of the puppet Manchukuo. His character was noble and pure, and he was truly one of the late people. Anyone who sees Mr. for the first time will definitely feel that his appearance is modest, like an old Confucian scholar in a rural village, and his speech is peaceful, without any air of arrogance. Mr.'s scholarship is profound, so he is different from a group of celebrities.

I can only say this about Mr. Brother Cangqiu has a poem mourning Mr., which can well express Mr.'s life. It is recorded here to end this article:

The majestic pine tree, who are you in this world, the dream of the stone of Wang Feng, the experience of a lifetime of stretching. Giving up office is not for high, knowing no poverty in cutting off food, seeing people without mistakes, and being in harmony with the world. Pure heaven has no secrets, who can compare to the old generation, sincerity is connected through Qu Sao, and the talent is hanging on the horizon. High style is left in the world, so that I can praise it for thousands of years. (Written in the morning of the 16th after Mr. Sanyuan's hearse departed from the North Station to Hangzhou)

### A Tentative Translation of Blake's "Tiger" Poem

— Zheng Xiaocang

Tiger lurking in the deep forest at night, its eyes shining like electric torches. What hands and eyes are so skillful as to cast such a majestic creature?

The electric torches illuminate the secluded valley, and suddenly rise to distant peaks. Do you still think of attaching wings? Who dares to try its edge?

Who used skill and strength to dare to stir the tiger's heart? Once your heart is stirred, who is not stripped of their courage?

Planning in the fiery furnace of the brain, the chaos is hammered. What anvil is used for the hundred refinements? How can you hold the fierce without fear?

The stars cast their spears, and tears rained from the heavens. Does the creator smile? Creating sheep and creating tigers?

Tiger lurking in the deep forest at night, its eyes shining like electric torches. Daring to encompass the sky, casting things like this!

### Talking About "Mother-in-Law"

— You Mojun

The world calls the wife's mother "mother-in-law." There is a saying in Wu dialect, "The mother-in-law looks at the son-in-law, the more she looks, the more interesting he is." However, "mother-in-law" can also be used as a general term for women who are respected. The General Mirror records that Han Yu called Liu Xuanzuo's mother "mother-in-law." It can be seen from the Collection of Liu Ziyuan that the term "mother-in-law" for the wife's mother has a long history. As for why the word "mother" is used, it is based on the Book of Han, Biography of the Xiongnu, which says "The Han Emperor is my father-in-law" and is changed.

The wife's mother is called "Yue Mu," but I don't know what it means. One says that ancient poems say "Rooted in Mount Tai," which means marrying relatives. Mount Tai is one of the Five Mountains, so it is associated with calling the wife's father "Yue Weng" or "Yue Zhang" or "Mount Tai," and the wife's mother can be called "Yue Mu" or "Tai Shui." "Tai Shui" is even more unspeakable, because there is no such water name!

The most appropriate thing is to call the wife's mother "Wai Gu," although the Erya Shiqin says "The mother of the uncle is Wai Gu," but the uncle and aunt are opposite words. Sun Shuang's commentary on Mencius Wan Zhang's sentence "The emperor housed the nephew in the second room" said, "Rites say that the wife's father is Wai Jiu," so the wife's mother may as well be called "Wai Gu."

### Spiritual Food

— Bao Zhongqi

These two days, rice prices have been rising sharply, and the market has been stirred up. All prices have also risen accordingly, and our spiritual food - books and newspapers - is naturally no exception, increasing by several percent, or even several times.

The most affected are of course us readers. Originally, we had some surplus money in our pockets, and when we passed by bookstores and newsstands, we could freely browse the newly published books and newspapers. If we were happy to see them, we would pick out two of our favorites and take them home. Holding a book, leaning against the window to read, or reading at night under the lamp, it was truly a pleasure.

However, our right to enjoy this quickly disappeared. We began to have no power to buy new books to read, sighing at the books with longing, and the bitterness and desire in our hearts were just like the people who were hungry and hoped to eat.

So, we moved our position and became regular customers of old book stalls. This time, we finally had a good time. There are also many good old books here. Not only can we often find out-of-print magazines that are valuable for reference, but also, as Mr. Jinjin wrote in this journal's "A Miracle," we often see new editions of magazines. At this time, the taste is really like discovering emerald in rough stone! As for if you can accidentally discover a literary work like Six Records of a Floating Life, it is only an unexpected harvest of digging cold stalls.

In fact, the publishing industry's downturn has forced books and newspapers to repeatedly reduce their size and increase their prices. Readers cannot afford it, and the number of sales is naturally light. Black characters printed on white paper are not as valuable as the original paper, and the biggest way for old books to go is to return to the paper mill by weight.

Therefore, old book stalls have become our only place to go.

Our spiritual food is running out, and we have become standard cultural refugees!

### The Problem of Old-Age Care in the United States

— Mao Yi

Since the Industrial Revolution occurred, the development of capitalism has affected family economics and ethical concepts, thus giving rise to the small family system, followed by the question of how to support and arrange for the older generation.

The United States is a highly capitalist country, and its problem of old-age care is even more serious. In 1850, the elderly over 65 years of age accounted for only 3% of the US population. Today, their proportion has increased by 7%, reaching 10 million people. Due to scientific progress and improved health, the number of elderly people will only increase. However, although the number has increased, the number of elderly people who spend their lives in the homes of their children and grandchildren has decreased.

Most of the American elderly, about 4 million, rely on some form of organized alms to maintain their lives. A small portion of the elderly enjoy appropriate private subsidies, civil service retirement benefits, or veteran benefits. However, most of the elderly still eke out a living on an average of $30 per month in state and federal old-age relief or insurance benefits. The former is a distressing expedient, and the latter is simply a cruel and teasing prank.

It is terrible to be old and unfortunately economically strapped. Their last hope is to seek refuge in public or private "poorhouses." According to reports from all sides, most of these institutions where American elderly spend their lives are mostly the slums in Dickens's novels. And these institutions are overcrowded. So, what happens to those elderly who cannot enter these not-so-comfortable shelters? The head of a city poorhouse in a big city replied, "They die alone."

Old-age care is no less important than childcare. The younger generation is our new generation, but the older generation is our cultivators. What's more, each of us has a day to grow old!

### Pure and Lofty

— Yi Jun

A: The academic exams are about to be held, right?

B: Yes, it starts on the 10th of this month and will be finished on the 11th.

A: Your studies are completed, congratulations!

B: Where? "Graduation is unemployment," it's very sad!

A: What about your work after graduation?

B: I'm working on it in all aspects, but I'm not sure yet.

A: What kind of work is it roughly?

B: I studied education, so of course I serve in the education field.

A: That's great, education work is so pure and lofty!

B: But it's too pure and hard.

A: Pure and hard is a little pure and hard, but all kinds of occupations are not as pure and lofty as your education field.

B: I have a little opinion about whether it is pure and lofty.

A: I would like to hear your opinion.

B: I think that the "occupation" itself is not pure or lofty, the question is what kind of "person" is engaged in the occupation? If the "person" engaged in the occupation is pure and lofty, then no matter what kind of occupation it is, it is pure and lofty; if the "person" engaged in the occupation is not pure and lofty, then no matter what kind of occupation it is, it is not pure and lofty.

A: That makes sense.

B: For example, in our education field, there are facts of corruption, extortion, academic shops, and rape. Can this be considered pure and lofty? There are also many loyal and honest officials in the officialdom. The principal of my junior high school, who served as a county magistrate, sold several acres of land in his family; my father served as the chief of general affairs for many years, but his official bag was empty. Can this also be said that being an official is not pure and lofty? In short, whether it is pure and lofty depends on what kind of "character" it is, not on what "occupation" it is.

A: What you said is very right, whether it is pure and lofty depends on "character." But there are also "occupations" that are not pure and lofty in themselves, such as gambling dens, brothels, and robbers.

B: But, for those occupations, my answer is that I don't recognize them as "occupations" at all. That is just a "crime" created by society.

### Preface to Deng Sanmu's Seal Collection

— Posthumous work of Jin Songcen

Yang Weizhen of Tieya possessed the ghostly talent of Li He, composing small-scale Yuefu poems like Zhang Wang, delighting in the ancient, desolate, and strange, and calling it the "Tie" style. Iron, as a material, is extremely rigid. To be rigid yet capable of softness is the heart of a poet; to be soft yet capable of rigidity is the brush of a poet. As for calligraphers, the brush is soft and the paper is also soft, but what strengthens it is the wrist; as for seal carvers, the carving knife is rigid and the stone is also rigid, but what makes it resilient is also the wrist. Rigidity and softness are the nature of things, but as for making the soft rigid and the rigid soft, the mind governs it, the qi governs it. When the qi flows through the wrist and reaches the fingers, then things change their nature, and my art is achieved. I once heard that Mr. Deng Sanmu was proficient in all four styles of calligraphy, which did not strike me as particularly unusual. But when I passed by the Daxin Tea House and saw Mr. Deng's cursive script, I was astonished, thinking that since Meng Jin of Jingzhao, this level of attainment had been unmatched for nearly three hundred years, with no one able to continue its legacy. I never expected that in the midst of the dust and burial of society, such a remarkable talent would emerge. Shen Ziyu Zhong said: "Sanmu is an eccentric. He admires Mr. Jing's conduct and wishes to meet him but has no means to do so." In the mid-autumn of Renwu, I returned to the coastal regions, and the two men invited me to drink at Jixiang Temple, where the food was exquisite. I said: "This is like Deng Zhai." Someone said: "It's a pity there's no Milindapanha." A monk at the temple, who was fond of drinking, rolled up his sleeves and said: "There is." He went downstairs and brought a female painter from a birthday banquet in the neighboring courtyard (Sanmu's note: Ms. Zhou Yunxia). The guests clapped their hands and drank freely. Two days later, we gathered again at Sanmu's residence. At that time, the bandits were practicing night warfare, and we drank together by lamplight, our wills full of fervor. Sanmu's nature is strange and unusual, resenting the world and despising vulgarity, but lamenting his poverty, he cannot escape worldliness to respect himself, so he unleashes his talent in the arts: besides military books, his seal carving is renowned as an exceptional skill. One day, he sent me his completed seal collection, a total of four volumes. I repeatedly studied them carefully and realized that his knife technique comes from Zhao of Yushan, but with a focused and solitary mind, he is able to roam the halls of hundreds of masters, worryingly creating his own ancient style, not rigidly adhering to the methods of teachers. Therefore, the intricate patterns of interlaced silk are not sufficient to describe its exquisite quality; the swirling patterns of Xuan Yuan are not sufficient to describe its freshness; the pursuit of the bell is not sufficient to describe its antiquity; the inverted eggplant is not sufficient to describe its splendor; the fur coats and horses of the Three Rivers are not sufficient to describe its application; the ceremonial robes of the Emperor's daughter are not sufficient to describe its solemnity; the crumbling walls of ruined palaces are not sufficient to describe its mystery; the crude carvings of the Hongya are not sufficient to describe its artlessness. There is a saying: "Intelligence surpassing one's teacher is the only way to transmit the craft." Is it the result of mental effort? Is it a reward of qi? Sanmu does not know it himself, but I can recognize it. Picking up my writing brush, I come to inquire about Sanmu.

### Mr. Deng Sanmu (Gouweng)'s Poetry, Calligraphy, and Seal Engraving are Known Throughout the World. Starting Today, an Exhibition Will Be Held at the Chinese Painting Academy on Chengdu Road. Art Lovers, Please Don't Miss This Opportunity to Feast Your Eyes. This is a Recent Work Engraved by Mr. Deng.
