### Laying Down an Iron Net in the Border Area of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan: National Army Entered Guzhen Yesterday; Bandits Fled Northwest, Unable to Cross the Lei and Fan Rivers

[Our Correspondent in Zhoubu, 5th] The National Army on the front lines here, after intensifying their attacks on the remnants of the bandit 6th Column resisting between the Xie River and the North Fei River, have completed the encirclement. The right wing, which originally moved north along the east side of the Jinpu Railway from Linhuai Pass, captured Jiuwanji, Renheji, Yuanzhaiji, and other places, advancing to the south bank of the Hui River. There is no longer a main bandit force on the east side of the railway in front of Bengbu. This unit then detoured west from near Wangzhuang (east of the Xinqiao Station) to attack, coordinating with the central route troops advancing north along the railway, jointly pressing the attack on the west side of the railway. The various units of the western front continue to attack on the north bank of the Fei River in their original formations. Fierce fighting continues in Lao Cao and Lao Ji, where stubborn bandits rely on strong fortifications, each bunker being a target of contention for both sides. Currently, the National Army controls half of these strongholds.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Military News: The Chen Yi bandit troops in the Sugu area, under the pressure of the National Army, have been fleeing towards Yongcheng in eastern Henan for days, attempting to return to their old nest in Shandong Province. The National Army is laying down an iron net along the Longhai Railway to the Yellow River flooded area to block and capture them. From the evening of the 3rd to the morning of the 5th, fierce battles raged in the triangular border area of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui. The bandits fled east and west, unable to stealthily cross the Lei and Fan rivers. Under the cover of the Air Force, the National Army moving north continued their attacks on the Chen Yi bandit troops entrenched in Guzhen from the night of the 4th to the morning of the 5th, braving the rain. The bandits, unable to withstand the attacks, fled in a panic towards the northwest. The National Army entered Guzhen on the morning of the 5th. At the same time, the National Army moving south along the Jinpu Railway past Jiagou, after breaking through stubborn bandit resistance, has now approached Fuliji. The bandit forces in that area are showing signs of collapse.

### The Bandits傾斜 All Forces South of the Yellow River: The National Army Seizes an Opportunity to Annihilate the Bandits; Secretary-General of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters Analyzes the Battle Situation

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 5th] Liu Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, today met with reporters for the first time in Bengbu and explained the current battle situation as follows: The Bengbu-Suxian campaign is currently developing in a way favorable to the National Army, with Suxian as its focal point. Our Huang Wei Corps, on the south bank of the Cao River, about fifty li southwest of Suxian, with Shuangdui as the core of its position spanning more than ten li in all directions, has been engaging in bloody battles with the main forces of the bandit Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng, etc., for nearly ten days. Before this corps's position, no less than 30,000 bandits have been killed. This corps is based on a crack unit of General Hu Lian's troops, which has been a strong enemy of the Liu bandits in the Central China theater. In order to reverse their decline, the bandits have also transferred the remnants of the Chen Yi troops, who had not yet been completely reorganized on the eastern and southeastern fronts of Xuzhou, to a line northwest of Suxian and in front of Bengbu, to prevent the encirclement of our northern and southern corps. The bandits participating in this battlefield have in fact倾斜 all their forces south of the Yellow River. In order to seize this good opportunity to annihilate the main force of the bandit army, the National Army made a decisive decision to abandon Xuzhou in order to increase the strength of the southern corps. Currently, the 300,000-strong army moving south, under the command of General Du Yuming, is advancing in three routes: the central route has crossed the Suihankou, the eastern route is pressing towards Fuliji, and the western route is divided into two groups, advancing to the area between Yongcheng and Suixikou, eliminating the resistance of the Chen bandits and pressing south step by step in a single-line formation. The Li and Liu corps on the Bengbu front, after switching from defense to offense seven days ago and forcibly crossing the Fei River in front of the enemy, are now using Bengbu as a base, deploying a semi-circular formation north along the Jinpu Road and west along the north bank of the Fei River, launching an annihilating attack on the bandit 6th Column, which is showing signs of collapse. When describing the battle situation on the Bengbu front, Liu said: Since Commander-in-Chief Liu came to Bengbu to take charge, the command has become more flexible. If the current progress can defeat the stubborn bandits and advance north according to plan, it would be the most ideal result. Otherwise, annihilating the entire bandit 6th Column would also be a great blow to the bandits in terms of battle results. Liu also stated that "to defend the Yangtze, one must first secure the Huai," so in this campaign, the National Army is using its superior military strength and mobile strategy to annihilate the main force of the bandit army. The National Army's victory is very certain. Liu's outlook on the future battle situation is that after the victory of the Bengbu-Suxian campaign, recovering Xuzhou would be as easy as turning one's hand, and even Zhengzhou and Kaifeng could be obtained easily. Liu expressed in his speech that the current war is a war related to the survival of the nation and the country. He repeatedly emphasized that the National Army will definitely win. He then said: Director Deng Wenyi stated on the 3rd of this month that there would be good news within five days. He had considerable confidence in making this statement.

[Our Correspondent in Zhoubu, 5th] Military News: According to Air Force reports, the corps moving south from Xuzhou is fully equipped, and there are no bandit pursuits on the rear of the troops, so its safety is not a concern.

### Fierce Battle Unfolds in Miyun: Military Observers Believe It Is the Prelude to a Major Battle in Eastern Hebei; Remnants of Bandits Outside Zhangjiakou Repeatedly Damaged and Have Become Calm

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 5th] The defense and offense of Miyun in northern Hebei unfolded fiercely on the 4th. The Lin bandit 11th Column has been advancing rapidly towards Miyun for days. It made contact with the defending troops on the evening of the 3rd and is currently engaged in fierce fighting near six li east and eight li south of the city. Military observers say that the fierce battle in Miyun, northern Hebei, can be seen as the prelude to a major battle in eastern Hebei.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 5th] More than 300 bandits from the northern Hebei sub-district and the 2nd Police Regiment roamed east of Changping at 7:00 am on the 4th.

From yesterday to this morning, the bandits suffered a day and night of heavy blows from the National Army's infantry and artillery. Casualties were extremely high. The National Army is currently continuing to fight the bandits on the outskirts of Miyun.

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 5th] The defeated bandits on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou suffered another setback. At noon on the 5th, our troops advancing west towards Ximalin (west of Zhangjiakou) engaged the bandits in Xingyugou (southwest of Ximalin). After six hours of fierce fighting, the defeated bandits suffered heavy casualties and continued to flee west. In this battle, more than 1,000 bandits were killed and wounded, and two cannons, eight machine guns, and more than 200 rifles were seized.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] The annihilation battle on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou has achieved a great victory after three days and nights of tenacious fighting by the National Army, dispersing the bandit 1st, 6th, and part of the 2nd Columns. Yesterday, north of Tumu, the two divisions, the Independent 7th and New 8th, under the command of the Zhan Danan bandit troops, were also defeated simultaneously. The outskirts of Zhangjiakou have now returned to calm. Citizens, in a state of excitement, are launching enthusiastic activities to comfort the troops. Also, the Pingzhang Railway between Zhangjiakou and Xiahuayuan was repaired at 4:00 pm on the 5th, and active repairs are underway between Xiahuayuan and Huailai.

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 5th] On the 3rd, the National Army engaged the bandit Independent 7th and 8th Divisions in the Taipingpu northeast area in Zhuolu County. After about five hours of encirclement and attack by our eastern and western armies, the bandits fled after suffering losses. In this battle, more than 1,500 bandits were killed and wounded, and two cannons and more than 1,000 long and short guns were seized.

[United Press, Beiping, 5th] Most observers in the old capital believe that the Communists will not launch a large-scale invasion in Hebei for the time being, waiting for heavy artillery to be transported from the Northeast. It is well known that the National Army in North China suffers from a lack of heavy artillery, but if the National Army can make full use of the Air Force, it can make up for this deficiency. Some people believe that Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of the North China Bandit Suppression, is preparing for a decisive battle. If the operations are carried out properly, the Hebei defense line can be held at least until next spring or summer.

He started working at the Western Suburb Pacification Headquarters on the 5th, handling military affairs.

Currently, except for the Niutuo and Numo positions in the southeast, which have been slightly eroded by the bandit army, all other positions are in the hands of the National Army. The positions on the west, north, and south sides have even been expanded. About 3,000 bunker fortifications surround Taiyuan City, extending ten li deep. Within the city, sixty to seventy percent are still being firmly defended. Except for the Wusu Airport, which was abandoned due to its distance, there are still six airports available for use. Some of these were completed by mobilizing civilian labor in a few days. They can fly 200 times a day, and there is absolutely no problem with importing manpower or materials by air. The bandit army surrounding Taiyuan has exhausted its strength. If the defending army receives sufficient external aid in the short term, it will be able to crush the enemy's offensive."

### Hoffman States Before Leaving the US That US Friendship with China Remains Unchanged; Lapham Arrives in Beiping from Shanghai for Inspection

[United Press, New York, 4th] Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, set off for China today to investigate the use of over 100 million yuan in aid to China.

Of the 275 million yuan in aid to China, 150 million to 160 million yuan has already been used or designated for use. The military situation has now affected the aid to China plan. Part of the mission of this trip is to investigate whether the 70 million yuan designated for construction in Central and Southern China can still be used for this purpose.

All US actions in China will respond to the situation in an appropriate manner to make the Chinese people believe in US concern. Hoffman plans to stay in London for three days first, consulting with Heffernan, Chairman of the Industrial Advisory Committee, on whether designated dismantled German factories, which are important to the Economic Cooperation Administration, can be retained.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Calls for Aid to China: The Plan is Submitted to the US by Ambassador Gu; Please Sponsor Our Anti-Communist War, Expedite the Use of Materials, Establish a Military and Economic Three-Year Plan, and Help 1 Billion Yuan Annually

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek is calling on the US to rescue China from Communism for a period of three years, costing three billion yuan. This plan was proposed by senior Chinese officials as the basis for aid negotiations with China. The plan lists four methods, which have been presented to President Truman by Ambassador Gu Weijun. Madame Chiang Kai-shek also made a detailed appeal to the US based on this principle and has talked to Secretary of State Marshall twice. She will meet with President Truman again early next week.

According to insiders, Madame Chiang Kai-shek will focus on the following two things: (1) The United States must have a greater understanding of China's situation; (2) China believes that it is not too late to save the overall situation; (3) The Chinese government believes that China is not only fighting for itself, but also fighting for the United States and other anti-communist countries. Madame Chiang Kai-shek is not very concerned about the details of how the US will provide assistance. She only wants the US to act in accordance with the following four methods in the plan proposed by China, namely: (1) Immediately declare that the US sponsors President Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist war to boost military morale. (2) Add and transport military materials before the US Congress passes the aid bill. According to the State Department report, about 125 million yuan of the military aid to China plan has been used up, except for about 100,000 yuan remaining. Senior Chinese officials said that although this money was used to purchase materials, only about 25 million yuan has actually been delivered to China. (3) Send well-known generals to China to take charge of the supply of the National Army, expand military training, and guide strategy. China hopes to send MacArthur to China, but President Truman refused. (4) Establish a three-year military and economic aid to China plan, with an annual subsidy of 1 billion yuan, including the expenses of the military delegation. According to Ambassador Gu Weijun's estimate, 60% of the first year's 1 billion yuan will be used for military aid, and 40% will be used for economic aid. Subsequently, as the military situation progresses, most of it can be used for economic aspects.

Gu told President Truman and State Department personnel that the Chinese government believes that the task can be completed within three years according to this plan. In general, US officials are still unwilling to accept it. According to military estimates, at least 5 billion yuan will be needed in three to four years to save China from the Communist Party. Truman, Marshall, and their advisors have at least temporarily decided that in China's current situation, any aid plan that seeks to be effective will actually be the responsibility of the United States. Both Truman and Marshall are most concerned that the US will be drawn into a situation where the chaos and disintegration of China consumes American money without end.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek originally intended to issue a formal statement on the 4th, but the Chinese Embassy announced that the statement has been postponed to be issued within the next few days.

### The United States Will Never Recognize Any Communist Government in North China; Spruance Urges Not to Stand by and Watch the Chinese War

[Associated Press, New York, 5th] "Business Week" published an article on the 5th, saying: The US government is still looking for an appropriate policy towards China, but "We can guarantee that the US will: (1) Refuse to recognize any North Chinese political regime in North China. American merchants staying in North China will take risks on their own. (2) Refuse any proposals to trade with the CCP and will not allow any American machinery and other production equipment to be shipped to CCP-controlled areas."

[United Press, Monterey, California, 5th] Retired Admiral Spruance said that the situation in China is critical and the US should send a strong delegation to China to guide US actions in China. China's war against Communism is not its own problem. We cannot stand by and watch. If China falls into the hands of the Communist Party, all of Asia (except India and Japan) will fall into the hands of the Communist Party. At that time, the rich resources of Southeast Asia will all be used by the Soviet Union.

### Unstable and Turbulent Japanese Political Situation

The fourth session of the Japanese Diet opened in the House of Councillors on the 2nd. This ordinary session is being held at a time of political turmoil, and its evolution and development are of great importance to the fate of the Yoshida Cabinet. On the opening day of the session, Emperor Hirohito attended and delivered an address to the members of both houses. In addition to praising the democratic spirit of the new constitution, Hirohito also called on members of the Diet to strive to make the Diet the "highest authority of the nation" and to redouble their efforts to gain the Diet's deep understanding of this "democratic and cultural country." Two days after Hirohito's address, Prime Minister Yoshida attended the Diet on the 4th and declared that he would dissolve the House of Representatives after the middle of this month. He said: "Japan needs to sign a peace treaty as soon as possible in order to achieve independence. If Japan does not have a truly democratic government, a peace treaty cannot be expected." Yoshida added: "The one and a half years since the first election after the enactment of the new constitution has been a period of political instability." This clearly illustrates that Yoshida is determined to dissolve the Diet, and this session may be the last gathering after the first general election.

The second Yoshida Cabinet was officially formed on October 19th. Before forming the cabinet, Yoshida fought hard to defeat the "Misaki Movement" conspiracy of Ashida, Miki, and some veteran members of the Liberal Party. After becoming prime minister for the second time, he overcame the opposition of the opposition parties and the indifference of the Allied Headquarters, and finally achieved considerable success in the provisional Diet, completing the revision of the Civil Service Law. Yoshida is a stubborn person who represents the interests of bureaucratic capitalists, landlords, and wealthy farmers. The parliamentarism he is devoted to is bourgeois democratic politics. With a very strong conservative stance, he resists the left-wing and centrist parties. Therefore, he holds a completely disdainful attitude toward the current intermediate Diet. When the Katayama and Ashida cabinets were formed, the Liberal Party did not participate in the government and strongly advocated dissolving the Diet and holding a new general election. When Yoshida was elected prime minister on October 14th, he received only 185 votes of support, with 213 abstentions. The majority of abstentions represent a force that is tantamount to expressing distrust in Yoshida. What Yoshida has been concerned about since taking office is the opposition force represented by these 213 abstentions, which constantly threatens the government. In particular, the Diet's discussion of the supplementary budget and new salary standards may force the government to collapse. Therefore, Yoshida uses dissolving the Diet as a threat, hoping to induce the opposition parties to submit by dissolving the Diet. If the opposition parties in the Diet (the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, the Cooperative Party, etc.) obstruct the government's supplementary budget or new salary standards, it is very likely that Yoshida will invoke Article 7 of the Constitution to dissolve the Diet and hold a new general election.

The new Japanese constitution grants the Diet the power to review and pass the budget, and this power is in the hands of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives. The smooth passage of the budget and tax increase bills of the Katayama and Ashida cabinets was due to the convenience of the situation. On the contrary, the convenience of Katayama and Ashida is Yoshida's difficulty. The Yoshida Cabinet took office in a state of extreme financial distress. In order to maintain the balance of expenditures for the next six months, it can only rely on a supplementary budget. In particular, the adjustment of civil servant salary standards accounts for a large portion of the expenditures, and a supplementary budget is necessary. Otherwise, the Yoshida Cabinet cannot be maintained. Half a year ago, the civil servant salary standard was 3,700 yen. The Socialist Party proposed adjusting it to 6,200 to 7,000 yen, while the labor side demanded 10,000 yen. On November 20th, 35,000 government civil servants held a second march to demand the implementation of the new standard of 7,300 yen, which is far from the figure listed in the government's supplementary budget. During the Ashida cabinet, the Ministry of Finance planned to adjust it to around 5,000 yen. This time, the supplementary budget bill submitted by the Yoshida Cabinet to the Diet stipulates that 5,300 yen should be used as the standard, plus temporary subsidies, totaling about 5,500 yen. If it is increased further, it will damage the interests of capitalists and landlords, which Yoshida is unwilling to do. Undoubtedly, civil servants and workers sympathize with the opposition parties in the Diet, and the opposition parties can use public opinion to confront the government and increase the difficulties of the Yoshida Cabinet. If this confrontational situation develops, unless the government dissolves the Diet, the government will be forced to resign, and the united front of the Socialist, Democratic, and Cooperative parties will make a comeback.

In short, the Yoshida Cabinet is facing difficulties. How Yoshida will overcome the "period of political instability" depends on Yoshida's skills. We must point out that the instability and turbulence of Japanese politics does not equate to the development of democratic politics. At this stage, Japanese politics is still far from the process of democratization. Even if the Diet is dissolved and a new general election is held, the true democratic forces may not be able to emerge. The democratic rhetoric of the Hirohito and Yoshida factions can only be regarded as propaganda. In fact, one cannot feel that Japan at this stage has become a "democratic and cultural country."

### Capital City's Land and Water Transportation Order Fully Restored; Zhang Yaoming's First Measure After Taking Office

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] After two days of rectification, the order at the Xiaguan Railway Station and Wharf in the capital has been fully restored. This is the first measure taken by the newly appointed Capital Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming after taking office. The order at the Xiaguan Railway Station and Wharf has been chaotic in the past week, causing inconvenience to passengers. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the President visited Xiaguan and ordered immediate improvements. Commander Zhang then ordered the Yijiang Gate to be closed from midnight on the 4th, and passengers carrying luggage were not allowed to leave the city in order to clear the luggage accumulated in Xiaguan. Some passengers, including high-ranking officials, who carried luggage out of the city on the 4th were all turned away. The passengers and luggage piled up at the Xiaguan Railway Station were then able to be transported out in an orderly manner. The Yijiang Gate was reopened at 6:00 AM on the 5th. A large number of military police were stationed at the railway station and ferry terminal to maintain order. Those without tickets were not allowed to enter the platform at the railway station, and passengers with tickets had to line up and enter the platform in an orderly manner, waiting for their tickets to be checked. The past situation of passengers crowding onto the train upon arrival, making it impossible for those getting off to squeeze out, has disappeared. In order to facilitate evacuation, Zhang has requested the Railway Bureau to find ways to add more trains to facilitate travel. The ferry terminal strictly prohibits ferries from stopping in the middle of the river and requires them to dock at the pier to avoid the danger of passengers getting on and off in small boats. A large number of police officers are dispatched to the port to maintain order upon arrival of the ships. Getting on the ship is the same as boarding the train, and passengers must line up to avoid crowding. The Capital Land and Water Transportation Service Station established by the Garrison Headquarters, with Deputy Commander Tan Yi concurrently serving as the director, has begun operations, maintaining land and water transportation in the capital and handling the evacuation of passengers, refugees, displaced students, and family members of public servants and teachers. In the future, the collective evacuation of family members of public servants and teachers will also be handled by this station.

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] It is reported that the government plans to lease 50 transport planes and 25 ships to evacuate 100,000 officials and their families. Families of personnel from the Presidential Office and the Five Yuan have priority for evacuation. The evacuation will begin on December 10th and will be directed by the Ministry of Transportation. The destinations for evacuation are Chongqing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Taiwan.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] In order to assist public servants and teachers of central government agencies in the capital to evacuate their families by railway, the Ministry of Transportation has established a Capital Central Government Agency Personnel Family Evacuation Committee and has formulated measures to be implemented immediately.

(2) The aforementioned list should clearly state the person's title, name, family relationship, number of people, route, and destination (attached format) and be submitted before December 7th. (3) After receiving the aforementioned list, the Ministry of Transportation Evacuation Committee will schedule dates and issue preferential ticket exchange certificates, limited to 6,000 people per day. This will be from December 10th to the end of December this year, and may be extended if necessary. (4) Evacuated family members should present their preferential certificates to designated locations to exchange for tickets at preferential fares. The trains they should take will be designated by the railway. (5) Evacuated family members should carry their own luggage, limited to two pieces per person (limited to trunks, bedding, or baskets). Other items should be shipped separately according to railway regulations. However, all furniture is absolutely not allowed on the train or to be shipped. (6) Children under the age of six are not counted; those between the ages of six and twelve pay half fare. (7) Public servants and teachers in the capital are limited to one preferential ticket exchange certificate per person. Family members who have been allocated certificates but do not travel at the designated time will not be reallocated, and they may not be transferred to others. The deadline stated on the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou line refers to the date for exchanging tickets and boarding the train in Nanjing, and will be invalid after the deadline. (8) During the evacuation period, the Military Police Headquarters should dispatch additional military police to maintain order at the railway station. Agencies and schools should also send one or two representatives to the station to take care of evacuating family members.

### Gold Certificates Exchanged for Foreign Grain; President Orders Vigorous Purchase and Transport; Ministry of Food is Negotiating with the Central Bank

[Ministry of Food News, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the repeated requests from major cities such as Tianjin and Taiyuan to the central government to use all the gold certificates collected to purchase foreign grain to alleviate the grain shortage in North China, foreign rice and wheat are subject to the overall distribution of the International Emergency Food Conference, and countries cannot freely purchase beyond the agreed quota.

### Berlin West District Municipal Council Elections Voters Eager to Vote Military Police on Guard Against Communist Sabotage

[United Press Berlin 5th Dispatch] The Berlin West District Municipal Council elections were held today. Germans are eagerly lining up to vote. According to the authorities, within five hours of the start of voting, the number of eligible voters who had completed voting exceeded 40% of the total. Official reports from 1,450 constituencies stated that voters in the first three hours accounted for 22% of the total, and the number of voters in the areas bordering the Soviet Union was "particularly large." A serious incident almost occurred in a certain French-occupied area near the Soviet border, but fortunately, a major issue was turned into a minor one. Three Soviet soldiers, armed with light machine guns, reportedly entered a polling station in the Reinickendorf district, threatening voters. French gendarmes were summoned and ordered the Soviet soldiers to withdraw. The Soviet soldiers then retreated to the Grol railway station within the Soviet border. In a certain area of the city, hundreds of German youths carrying wooden sticks attempted to obstruct the work of a polling station and distributed communist propaganda leaflets. Voting in the British, American, and French sectors of Berlin began at 8:00 AM, with Germans waiting in long queues. Elections were prohibited in the Soviet sector, and the Communist Party boycotted the general election in the three western sectors. Public transport in the western sector was suspended from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM to allow 150,000 West Berliners working in the Soviet sector to have the opportunity to vote. Hundreds of German special police from various parts of the Soviet sector had rushed to the Soviet sector of Berlin for unknown reasons. At the start of the election, 10,000 German police were deployed on alert, and British, American, and French troops were also on standby, patrolling the border in jeeps.

Because the strength of the East and West will be answered in this vote, every vote represents one vote for Western democracy and one less vote for communism. There are approximately 1,683,000 eligible voters. The Western occupying authorities and anti-communist parties hope that 75% to 90% of them will vote. If so, the prestige of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union will be greatly damaged, which is equivalent to a major victory for Western democracy.

### UN General Assembly Likely to Close as Scheduled Political Committee Rejects Proposal to Withdraw Foreign Troops from Holy Land

[United Press Paris 4th Dispatch] The UN General Committee has begun operations to end this session of the General Assembly on the 11th of this month.

It is understood that the majority of the General Committee agrees to resume work at Lake Success after the New Year. However, Britain still told the committee that it might suggest amending the agenda to raise the issue of handling former Italian colonies before the Korean issue, which will be discussed next time.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 4th Dispatch] The Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Palestine issue this afternoon. During the discussion, the General Assembly voted 33 to 7 with blank votes, rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw foreign troops from the Holy Land. By a vote of 26 to 14 with blank votes, the Syrian proposal to establish a central or federal unified Palestinian government was rejected. The British proposal to establish a Palestine Mediation Committee has not yet received the support of a two-thirds majority. The Palestine issue will soon be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. The next agenda of the Political Committee is the Korean issue, which is currently scheduled to begin next Monday. However, the British representative requested that the issue of former Italian colonies be discussed in advance.

### 800 American Communists Complete Training in Soviet Union

Now Returned to US to Train Secret Army

[United Press Washington 4th Dispatch] Investigators of the House Un-American Activities Committee stated on the 4th that 800 members of the American Communist Party trained in Moscow are presiding over the training of secret armies in an attempt to overthrow the United States government. These "800 people were trained at the Lenin School in Moscow and have now returned to the United States." This news is contained in the committee's recently published booklet "100 Things You Should Know About Communism and Education." The committee stated: The Lenin School is the highest communist training school, where students are free to choose courses such as factory sabotage, bomb making, kidnapping, car destruction, riots, civil war, espionage, and infiltration of organizations. The purpose of the school is to produce cadres who know how to create unrest within a country and seize power. In the list of 100 questions and answers, the committee stated: The Communist Party is attempting to seize the American school system. This booklet is one of five pamphlets published by the committee on the techniques of Communist infiltration of organizations.

[United Press Rome 5th Dispatch] The Gasperi government won its third victory over leftist elements in parliament on the 5th, one month after forming a cabinet. Members of parliament supporting the government easily defeated a no-confidence motion proposed by the Communist Party and pro-Communist elements.

### Mysterious Luminous "Fire Wheel" Falls into US Ohio Residential Area Surrounded by Smoke Like White Snow

[United Press Fairmount, Ohio 5th Dispatch] A "fire wheel" was suddenly discovered in the sky here on the evening of the 4th, flew into a residential area and fell to the ground. The police department has sent the remaining parts to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, hoping that people in the Air Force Laboratory can determine what the "fire wheel" is and where it came from. When the "fire wheel" came, the entire area was illuminated like a painting, and then it was surrounded by smoke, like clouds. Sheriff Burton said that the remains of this object are quite similar to the tires of airplanes or cars. When this "wheel" landed, a patrol officer tried to put it out, but unexpectedly caused it to disintegrate completely, leaving only two small pieces. Burton believes that this may be part of an experiment with radio wave-controlled weapons at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He said: The parts obtained in the rescue are metallic, and their condition is as if they had been tempered by extraordinary high heat. He initially thought that the "fire wheel" had fallen from an airplane. After investigating the airports in the area, it was learned that no aircraft had lost any parts while passing through Fairmount.

The earthquake caused thousands of dollars in damage to Palm Springs, and many windows were shattered throughout the region. A mother elephant in the Griffith Park Zoo had a miscarriage as a result.

### Communist Forces in Asia

— Translated by Shi

Based on this policy, the United States has allowed France to transfer $35 million from the Marshall Plan funds to Indochina, in the hope of enabling France to regain its "occupier" position in Indochina. Similarly, the United States has also allowed the Netherlands to transfer $54 million from the Marshall Plan funds to Indonesia, in the hope of restoring its old power.

Transferring European aid funds to Asia in this way is a major mistake by the United States, and as a result, voices of opposition have risen throughout Asia. Former Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir, a friend of the United States, said: "What we hope from the United States is to enable small nations to gain freedom, independence, and democracy. But in reality, the United States' policy is to support the colonial authorities, which is contrary to our wishes. So our dissent cannot be attributed to us."

The movement now being launched by the Communist Party in Asia is unfavorable to the United States. Most of the local Communist leaders have been trained in Moscow. In the Far East, their only slogan is land reform and improvement of tenant farmers' treatment.

In China, the Communist Party has been fighting against the central government for twenty years, and is now gradually expanding its controlled areas.

In Japan, although the activities of the Communist Party are restricted by the Allied forces, it still has its position. The Communist Party's strength in Japan is strong in trade unions, the National Labor Liaison Council, and other independent united organizations.

In Indochina, the Communist Party's power has only been cultivated after two years. Their leader is a person who has been trained in Moscow. Other Communist leaders also serve as commanders in the Vietnamese army.

In Siam, the people have little affection for the Communist Party, and the official hope is to take a neutral stance in the Cold War. But in an era of terror, with the Communist Party gaining an advantage throughout Asia, Siam may not be safe.

In Malaya, what the Communist Party is plotting is to drive away the British who run rubber plantations and tin mines. In May, they attempted to organize a nationalist army but failed. Now they are organizing guerrillas, planning to create terrorist incidents, assassinations, and other labor unrest. Although the Communist Party cannot legitimately organize an independent army, it has the ability to make Malaya uneasy.

In Indonesia, Communist power is being actively cultivated. In the early days of the organization of the Republic of Indonesia, the power of the Communist Party was still very weak, but now the Indonesian Communist Party has the ability to overthrow the government. Because the United States announced its support for the Netherlands, the Communist Party's excuse is anti-Americanism. Communists occupy a quarter of the seats in the Provisional Parliament of the Republic of Indonesia.

In Burma, the Communist Party is plotting underground, resisting the socialist government that only became independent from Britain a year ago. The residents of central Burma are more inclined to Communism, and the rebel army includes veterans, former Burmese soldiers, and military police. The current Burmese government is using a policy of freely distributing farmland to benefit tenant farmers in order to escape the red disaster.

In India, the expansion of Communist power is being restricted, and the government is imprisoning many Communist leaders. But in the southern provinces of India, they are still supported by the rural masses, and this potential power is a hint of a future military coup by the Indian Communist Party.

In short, the Cold War in Asia is getting hotter and hotter. The Communist Party is expanding its power in both political and military aspects. According to general observations, the United States is failing in the Cold War in Asia, but it is still kept in the dark. If it does not change its policy, the consequences will be disastrous.

### Chongqing-Shanghai Passenger Plane Crashes Due to Fog Landing at Jiangwan and Colliding, Catching Fire Crew and Passengers Dead Eleven Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the explosion and sinking of the Jiangya steamer outside Wusongkou, yesterday evening at Jiangwan Airport, another Central Air Transport Corporation C-46 type No. 538 Chongqing-Shanghai flight crashed and burned due to fog. The pilot, co-pilot, and radio operator were all killed. Eight of the 18 passengers died (including one infant), and ten were injured. Five of the deceased bodies were transported to the China Funeral Home for handling that night. One body only had half left, and it was still under the fuselage. It was not excavated last night because of the lack of time. Five people died shortly after being transported to Gongji Hospital. The injured are now all being treated at Gongji Hospital. The details of the accident are recorded below:

Central Air Transport Corporation flight No. 538 Chongqing-Shanghai took off from Chongqing at 11:30 yesterday morning, carrying passengers Xu Daozi, Zhong Shizhao, Zhong (child), Yang Fahui, Zhang Zhongche, and others, five people in total. It arrived in Wuhan in the afternoon and continued its flight at 2:30 PM.

At about 4:00 PM, after passing Nanjing, the weather had changed greatly, with heavy fog in the sky and the airport already closed. The plane flew directly to Shanghai. It arrived over the city at around 5:00 PM. At that time, it was also raining and foggy. Longhua Airport had poor equipment and could not land, so the air traffic control tower notified it to contact Jiangwan Air Force Airport (with radar equipment) to try to land. At 5:48 PM, under the guidance of US ground personnel, the aircraft slowly descended towards the runway. Unexpectedly, when it was about to touch down, due to the extremely heavy fog on the ground and poor visibility, the left wing crashed violently into a mound about ten meters from the north end of the runway. Immediately, the fuselage split, and the left engine caught fire and burned. Seeing this, US military and our air force personnel at the airport immediately tried to rescue them, urgently telephoning the fire department for assistance, and Gongji Hospital to send vehicles to transport the dead and injured. Cai Zhiren, director of the Central Air Transport Corporation Shanghai station, also immediately led company office staff to the scene to handle the aftermath after hearing the news. The flames in the aircraft were soon extinguished. Six people in the aircraft died on the spot. Except for one person who was pressed under the fuselage and could not be dug out, five bodies were immediately transported to the China Funeral Home. The remaining injured were immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but five of them died from their injuries shortly after arriving at the hospital. The remaining luggage and belongings in the aircraft were concentrated and temporarily stored at the airport, guarded by personnel sent by the company and the airport. This morning, Central Air Transport Corporation will continue to send personnel to the airport to excavate the other body and handle other aftermath matters.

### List of Dead and Injured

The list of the dead and injured is as follows: Dead: Pilot Ye Binghao, Co-pilot Meng Chaozong, Radio Operator C.w.wang, Passengers Mao Runquan, Zhang Zhongche, Zhong (child), Zhong Shijian, Zxeltzer, and there are three more deaths. According to the passenger list, they should be three of the four people Xu Daozi, Chen Zhixiang, Guan Puzhao, and Dong Guoyong, but one of them did not actually come to Shanghai, and Liu Zizhong (a staff officer of the Garrison Command, only slightly injured) replaced him. Therefore, it is not yet clear which three people are. As of the time of publication, Central Company is still sending personnel to the China Funeral Home to investigate the documents on the bodies.

Injured: Liu Youcheng, forehead laceration. Wang Fuzhou, left forehead laceration. Yang Fahui, bleeding on top of head. Yuan Zhimao, head laceration. Liu Zizhong, head laceration.

Among them, the No. 531 plane was about to run out of gasoline and was able to land safely at the last moment, which was also said to be dangerous.

### Relief for Wandering Refugees in Shanghai: Social Affairs Bureau Distributes Gruel

Severe cold has arrived. Due to the current situation, the number of refugees fleeing to the city from various places is increasing day by day.

### Dissatisfaction Among Teachers and Staff of Municipal Schools Regarding the Method of Distributing Confiscated Materials

[Reported by this newspaper] Teachers and staff of municipal primary and secondary schools previously requested improved living conditions and implemented a general leave. After persuasion by Mayor Wu and others, they cancelled their leave and returned to teaching. The municipal government then planned to distribute confiscated materials from the price-controlled period to all public employees in the city. It is now learned that after several meetings, most of the confiscated materials, such as coal, oil, and paper, must be returned. Only cigarettes can be sold for 300,000 yuan, which can be distributed to 50,000 public employees throughout the city, with each person receiving approximately 6 yuan. Teachers and staff of municipal primary and secondary schools were quite disappointed after hearing this, believing that it was too far from their original requests. They expressed their refusal to accept it and will hold meetings separately in the near future to discuss countermeasures.

The rumors of suicide may be guesswork." Fang Zhi, along with Secretary-General Xie Renjian, went to General Huang's residence here yesterday morning to express condolences to his wife. He stated: "The people of the whole country are admiring and applauding General Huang and all the officers and men under his command for their bravery and powerful display to smash the bandits' attempts."

The flames soared into the sky, quickly spreading to four other companies, including Yuanchang Rice Store at No. 249, Meitong Electric Appliance Factory at No. 257, and Tongxing Tire Shop and Xinfaxiang Hardware Store. When the fire department's watchtower discovered the fire, it immediately dispatched five pump trucks to rush to the scene to put out the fire. However, due to the fire already raging, it still felt that there were not enough people. Therefore, the Central Brigade, Jing'an Temple Brigade, and Songshan Brigade were dispatched to assist in the rescue. The fire was brought under control, and it was completely extinguished at about 6:00 AM. When the fire broke out, it was late at night, and more than ten workers from the Great China Tobacco Company were unable to escape from their sleep and were buried in the fire pit.

These included Huang Changzhong, Qiu Shaolong, Cui Xinzhong, Huang Azhang, Yan Ayun, Jia Yongshun, Li Xiang'er, Ye Zhibie, Chen Zhiheng, and Gao Yuchun. Among them, Cui Xinzhong (59 years old, doorman of the Great China Company) suffered burns all over his body and died shortly after arriving at the hospital.

The fire department is still investigating the truth. In addition, firefighters have dug up five bodies at the scene of the fire yesterday, and will continue to excavate today. In addition to the destruction of the above-mentioned houses and more than 20 casualties, the loss of other items such as machinery and materials is estimated to reach more than 10 million gold yuan.

The two sides lined up. Before the game, the audience was uncertain about the outcome. Zhou Dayun of Yongsheng replaced Xu Xiang as the mainstay in the front row. Huayan attacked first and seemed to gain momentum, but after each scored three points, they fell into a slump. Yongsheng's score increased to eleven points and the teams switched sides. Huayan counterattacked, and the situation suddenly changed. The score was close, and Yongsheng struggled to win the first set with a score of 21 to 17. In the second set, Yongsheng's kills were heavy, and they took the lead. Huayan passively accepted the situation and held on until 9-9 and 10-10, and then surpassed with 11. Liu Yongxiang quickly scored three points, eventually reaching 21 to 15, and Huayan pulled back one set. In the third set, Yongsheng's morale was boosted, and they cruised to victory with a score of 21 to 8. This set lasted less than ten minutes. Yongsheng took the lead with two sets to one. However, Huayan did not relax, and the situation changed repeatedly, with the two sides alternately taking the lead. When the teams switched sides, Yongsheng had 11 points and Huayan had 9. Yongsheng worked hard again, and when the score reached 20 to 17, Huayan quickly scored two points. Unfortunately, they accidentally touched the net, and the score was 21 to 19. Yongsheng was able to defeat Huayan three sets to one and win this year's championship.

### Aftermath of the Jiangya Steamer Tragedy: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Dispatches Ship to Recover Bodies; Over 300 Family Members of Victims Accompany; Ningbo Compatriot Association to Convene Emergency Meeting This Afternoon

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo liner "Jiangya" of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company encountered an accident on the evening of the 3rd off Bailonggang near Litongsha outside Wusongkou. This newspaper has been closely following the situation. Yesterday, being Sunday, the company's passenger ticket department remained open to handle the aftermath of the Jiangya incident. Over three hundred family members of the victims arrived at the company early in the morning to inquire about news, their weeping and sorrow a truly heartrending scene. They requested the company dispatch a ship to the accident site to search for and recover bodies, resulting in a loud and chaotic scene due to the large number of people voicing their concerns. Subsequently, the company dispatched the "Haihu" steamer, which had just returned to Shanghai from Tianjin, to the accident site at around 11:00 AM yesterday, carrying over three hundred family members of the victims. Simultaneously, the "Jian" steamer was also dispatched, carrying several radio operators to provide updates at all times. Around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, a small number of passengers' family members suddenly claimed that they had discovered recovered silver shields, furs, and other items in the company's police department room. All thirty or so family members gathered to observe and questioned the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as to why the bodies had not been found, but the items had already been recovered and transported back to Shanghai. According to the family members of the passengers, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company previously dispatched the "Qiujin" steamer to recover bodies, but returned to Shanghai without finding any. Therefore, they expressed doubts about when these items were brought back to Shanghai. They also stated that the furs were still wet, proving they must belong to the passengers who were in distress. The silver shield was engraved with the words "Congratulations to Mr. Xiaxuan of Tongchun Money Exchange on His Honorable Appointment." The family members also requested the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to investigate and announce whether this "Mr. Xiaxuan" was also one of the passengers in distress. As no responsible personnel from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were present at the scene at the time, the commotion continued for a long time without any resolution.

At the urging of this newspaper, a decision to raise three demands was made.

At 7:00 PM in the evening, the family members of the passengers in distress appointed Li Zuan, Wu Wenlong, Zhu Hangen, and Ren Jinzhen as representatives to come to this newspaper, expressing their collective grief and indignation after the incident, appealing for justice, and stating that they would make three demands to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: (1) When the family members of the passengers were dispersed on the evening of the 4th, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company promised that all departments would remain open on the 5th (Sunday) to handle the matter, but this was not implemented yesterday. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should immediately appoint someone to negotiate the aftermath with the family members. (2) The family members should accompany the search for and recovery of bodies at the accident site. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should fulfill this daily until the family members are satisfied, and the search situation should be telegraphed to Shanghai three times a day (morning, noon, and afternoon) for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to announce. (3) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should be responsible for thoroughly investigating and announcing the cause of the incident and the fact that the clothes of distressed passengers were found and transported to Shanghai before the bodies were recovered.

The company's shipping department has now decided to dispatch the "Haiqian" to transport them to the accident site again at 9:00 AM this morning. The family members of the victims will board the ship at the third wharf at 9:00 AM this morning.

Over a Thousand People Registered as Victims Yesterday

On the other hand, the family members of some of the victims gathered at the Ningbo Compatriot Association yesterday to discuss the matter and decided to start registering the victims immediately. As of last night, 1,020 people had been registered. This afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association will convene an emergency board of directors meeting, which the representatives of the victims' families will attend. Important decisions regarding relief and negotiations will be made.

### Company Authorities Declare: Determined to Handle Aftermath with Full Effort

Last night, a reporter from this newspaper visited Mr. Shen Zhongyi, Deputy General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. According to him, after the Jiangya incident, the company immediately made every effort to handle the aftermath. On the night of the incident, multiple ships were urgently dispatched for rescue, and vessels from other companies also bravely participated, rescuing approximately one thousand passengers and crew members, the complete list of whom has been officially announced. Rescue ships were dispatched on the morning of the 4th to actively search day and night. A special ship was dispatched yesterday morning to transport the victims' families to the accident site for on-site inspection, and it was decided to continue this for three more days, dispatching a special ship at 9:00 AM every morning to transport the families for inspection (due to tidal conditions, it can only depart once a day, otherwise it will not be able to return on the same day). A relief committee has been established to specifically handle the aftermath. Yesterday afternoon, senior company officials held a meeting, chaired by General Manager Xu himself, who earnestly instructed the company's personnel to devote all their efforts to this matter. Starting today, a liaison office will be established at 33 Fuzhou Road by the relief committee, and someone will be assigned to be responsible for contacting all the family members and handling all matters. As for the cause of the incident, after much research, it was determined that it was not caused by a boiler explosion or other defects in the ship itself. As for whether it was a water mine or a time bomb, it is still under investigation and a detailed report will be released soon. However, although this accident was beyond the company's control, the company expresses its deepest sympathy for the passengers and crew members in distress and will do its best to handle the matter properly. It is hoped that all the families of the victims will share in the difficulties, control their grief, and calmly cope with the situation to ensure proper handling.

### Citywide Industrial Circles Hold General Assembly and Discuss Issues: Establish Anti-Communist National Salvation Association; Conduct Widespread Fundraising for the Military and Strengthen Anti-Rebellion Propaganda

The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a joint meeting of all directors and supervisors and persons in charge of various trade unions at the Yucai Middle School Auditorium on Shanhai Guan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to review the current situation and invite representatives of the industrial community's delegation to Xuzhou to report on what they saw on the front lines and the process of expressing sympathy and support. A total of more than 600 directors, supervisors, and persons in charge of various trade unions attended, and Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian (represented by Shen Ding), Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor Lu Jingshi, Yi Chang Fan Gongzhan, and Supervisory Committee member Tao Baichuan were invited to speak. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

At the beginning of the meeting, Zhou Xuexiang, chairman of the federation, delivered a speech stating that the country is currently implementing a total war, and the soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles to suppress the bandits. The significance of the federation convening this meeting today is that all workers in the city should review and understand the current war situation. If we want to stabilize the morale of Shanghai and maintain social order, we must strengthen our resolve and unity. Then, Chen Boliang and Sun Jinghu, representatives of the Shanghai industrial community who went to Xuzhou to express sympathy and support, reported on the process of expressing sympathy and support and the impressions they gained.

Speeches by the Mayor and Others

Mayor Wu was then invited to speak, saying that recently, Shanghai citizens have been talking about escaping every day, believing that Shanghai will eventually be lost. This kind of subconscious judgment is the most undesirable. He believes that the Beijing-Shanghai area is not in danger at all, and the most dangerous thing is the fear that should not exist in people's minds. He hopes that all the workers in the city will unite to achieve true stability. Subsequently, Lu Jingshi, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor, delivered a speech, saying that the significance of the industrial community holding this joint meeting is extremely important. Every worker should have a deep understanding of the current situation in order to dispel the terror in everyone's minds. Lu also suggested that the industrial community should mobilize to organize an anti-communist national salvation organization and strive for the future of the country, the nation, and individuals.

Ten Proposals Passed

After the leaders finished speaking, the discussion of proposals began, and the following points were passed: (1) Establish the Shanghai Industrial Community Anti-Communist National Salvation Mobilization Committee and invite persons in charge of various trade unions to participate. (2) All workers in the city should donate ten yuan each to express sympathy and support to the soldiers on the front lines. This donation should be completed before the 15th of this month and will be managed by the Mobilization Committee. (3) The property of people who have fled to Hong Kong should be requisitioned, and their private residences should be allocated to hospitals. (4) The workers themselves should rise up to eliminate spies and bandits. (5) Expand anti-communist national salvation propaganda and authorize the Mobilization Committee to be responsible for planning. (6) Pass a declaration on the current situation. (7) Send a telegram to the whole country to respond to the military labor movement. (8) Send a telegram to express sympathy and support to the soldiers on the front lines. (9) People who have fled to Hong Kong are not allowed to return to Shanghai. (10) Negotiate to borrow all radio stations in the city to expand propaganda.

### General Association of Tenants Holds Symposium: Opposes Unreasonable Rent Increases; Four Measures Resolved

In order to oppose the recent unreasonable and unauthorized rent increases by real estate owners, the Shanghai General Association of Tenants held a symposium on rent issues at the Daguan Society on West Nanjing Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. It was chaired by Jiang Hao, and over 100 directors, supervisors, and representatives of tenants' associations from various districts of the city, including Zhang Zhongyuan, He Yuanming, Ma Junshuo, Chen Peide, Shao Yongsheng, and Lu Shuda, attended. During the meeting, the representatives expressed their extreme indignation at the unreasonable rent increases by real estate owners and decided that, except for those who agree to a reasonable agreement through mutual consultation, they would take unified action and refuse to pay the illegal new rent. After heated speeches lasting three hours, the following four specific measures were finally resolved: (1) Submit a request to the Municipal Council to revise the maximum rent limit. (2) Before the new limit is set, the old limit of 7,000 to 9,000 times the pre-war rent should still be valid in accordance with legal principles. If the landlord demands payment, it can be deposited in the bank. (3) Before the new limit is set, if the tenant is willing to adjust the rent, they can negotiate with the landlord. As for the highest number to be adjusted, He Yuanming, Jiang Hao, Shao Yongsheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Chen Peide, Ma Junshuo, and Lu Shuda are nominated to form a subcommittee to conduct detailed research and formulate a plan to notify all members to take unified action. (4) When the rent is adjusted, the deposit rent shall not be recovered, and it shall be at least six months as one period, and no adjustment shall be made within the period. According to reports from tenant representatives such as Lu Shuda, the real estate owners had exchanged views before the rent increase and decided on the rent increase standard, which was based on two principles: restoring the pre-war rent level and adding 250 to 350 times the rent on August 19. However, some landlords who sought excessive profits charged rent far exceeding this standard. Councilor Chen Peide, in his capacity as a tenant representative, pointed out that the monthly rent for his residence at No. 8 Xianfang on Huageguo Road before the war was 18 yuan. On "August 19," it was 135,000 yuan in legal tender. The notice he recently received stated that the rent would be increased to 135 gold yuan from September, a rate of increase that was unimaginable.

### Korean Special Envoy to China Visits Chairman Pan

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jeong Hwan-beom, Korean Special Envoy to China, arrived in Shanghai from Korea yesterday and will fly to Beijing today.

### Gospel of Education for the Poor in the Frontier: Interview with Ai Zhenhua

— Zhao Zhan, Reporter of This Newspaper

[Aviation News from Zhangjiakou, November 2] Ms. Ai Zhenhua, who is dedicated to elementary education in Zhangjiakou, educates a group of poor children who are not qualified to enter school with the spirit of a missionary. This noble spirit is comparable to that of any great educator of any era, and it also allows her to surpass Mr. Wu Xun, who founded schools by begging.

The reporter visited Ms. Ai Zhenhua in the slum of Zhangjiakou. Her "school" is not officially registered with the Education Bureau, and the municipal government does not provide any subsidies. She started the school and plans to expand it. Her efforts have been praised by the society. Perhaps people do not know about other schools, but no one does not know about Ai Zhenhua in the slum and the elementary school she runs.

Residence Is the School

That is a cluster of small houses on a hillside on the edge of the city. One of them, which is relatively clean, is Mr. Ai's residence, which is also the school. In the summer, students take classes in the courtyard. In the winter, her bedroom becomes the classroom. She has an eleven-year-old daughter, who is intelligent and lively, and is her teaching assistant (little teacher) and school worker. Mr. Ai talked about her motivation for starting this slum elementary school, saying: "Most of the people here are illiterate, and their living habits tend to be degraded. Most school-age children are rejected from school, scolding on the streets and playing in the alleys all day long, which is tantamount to declaring their hopelessness and terror in the future. Some, though not to this extent, are drafted into the army at a considerable age. When they leave, the mother and son are reluctant to part and cry together. After half a year or several months, they do not see a word sent back. The mother and son are very worried, but they have no way to express it. Every time I see this scene, I feel deeply sighed, so I rely on my conscience and do my best to educate poor children who cannot afford to study." Their parents and people in the society agree very much and give me great comfort.

Tree Branches and Iron Nails Instead of Pens

Regarding the establishment of the school, Mr. Ai said: "I first obtained the consent of the head of the district and the parents of the students. I borrowed a small blackboard of less than six feet from an acquaintance, bought a box of chalk, and borrowed a small clock. I gathered more than 20 children from the neighborhood, and we were able to hold open-air classes in the courtyard in early February. They are all poor students, and they do not have any school supplies at all. I had to write the words on the blackboard, and the students used tree branches, iron nails, and other hard objects instead of pens. The square in the courtyard is paper or slate.

Classroom Transformation Successful

This kind of situation lasted for more than four months. Summer came, and the scorching sun was in the sky. The malnourished bodies of the children could not stand the burning sun. So, in early June, the teachers and students worked together to transform a classroom (as I saw it). A carpenter was hired to change a large table into four small tables. In this simple classroom, they are taught words and etiquette. The reporter saw that the students had a polite attitude, which was completely unlike the group of wild children often seen elsewhere, and was very moved. I thought of Rousseau's saying: "The depravity of children is mostly due to the lack of proper guidance," which contains the truth.

Dedication to Educational Determination

Running such a simple school is by no means an easy task, and it cannot be done without perseverance. Mr. Ai talked about her difficulties and the hope in the difficulties. She said: "The lack of formal school buildings limits the number of children who want to come to study. Moreover, it is too difficult to run it this way. There is no source of funding for the school, and I will never be willing to give up halfway. I have made up my mind to devote myself to this, just like devoting myself to religion, and do my best to help the poor compatriots. I hope that this school can be developed into a well-established school with the sympathy and assistance of enthusiastic people. I am working hard towards this goal."

Born in an Orphanage

Ms. Ai Zhenhua is 42 years old this year, and her face is full of wrinkles, which shows her past hard work. She is from Salachi County, Suiyuan. When she was one year old, her mother committed suicide by smoking opium. She was adopted by the teacher E Bige and grew up in an orphanage. She graduated from a normal school run by the church and then became a missionary. She first married Zhao Jun, a teaching assistant, but unfortunately, Zhao Jun died early. She remarried Dr. Shen. They came to Zhangjiakou in the year the Japanese surrendered. Ms. Ai was raised by a pastor, so she dedicated her life to religion. Because of her unfortunate background, she is even more grateful to God and serves the poor people with great piety.

In the desolate frontier wilderness, the school founded by Mr. Ai has real value. Naturally, her school needs sympathy and assistance very much.

### Chenxi, Western Hunan: Coal Mine Flooded; Miners Buried; Five Survivors

[Express News from Changsha, November 29] Chenxi, Western Hunan, is one of the coal mining areas in Hunan. Although there are no large-scale companies mining, there are many small private companies. Among them, there is the Huimin Coal Mining Company, which uses old methods for mining. Recently, due to equipment reasons, a tragic mine flooding occurred. The details are as follows: At 6:00 PM on October 18, all the miners in the cave had left work and left the cave, but a small number of well workers and diggers continued to work in the cave in order to increase their income. Unexpectedly, the mine was suddenly flooded with water. When the company used a water pump to rescue them, the power failed. As a result, this group of miners left in the cave were buried alive in this dark hell. It was not until November 17 that the company made every effort to pump out all the stored water in the cave and dredge the mine. When they entered the cave at that time, in addition to finding seven dead bodies, they actually found five living people. These five people had been there for more than 20 days. It is reported that after the cave was flooded and isolated from the outside world, they ate the bodies of the dead when they were extremely hungry in order to survive. Now, because these five people have been isolated from the sunlight for too long, they dare not move out of the cave and are temporarily staying in the cave, and the company sends them rice soup every day to survive.

### Courts Withdrawn from Northern Jiangsu and Centralized in Yangzhou and Taizhou for Office

[News from Suzhou, November 2] The Jiangsu High Court believes that in recent times, the local courts and judicial offices in some disaster-stricken areas of northern Jiangsu have withdrawn due to banditry, and the transmission of official documents is extremely difficult. Therefore, President Liang has stipulated that the courts withdrawn from various places should be concentrated in Yangzhou and Taizhou to establish joint offices in order to obtain contact.

[Another News] Shen Jinghua, the pseudo-county magistrate of this county, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Supreme Court. Shen was still not satisfied after the sentence was passed and yesterday filed another petition to the Jiangsu High Court for retrial.

### Guizhou Province Intensifies Preparations for the Establishment of the Guizhou Products Transportation and Sales Company

— Liu Mengchi, Reporter of This Newspaper

[Aviation News from Guiyang, November 26] In recent years, Guizhou Province's agricultural production has achieved great results due to the authorities' active advocacy and the people's self-consciousness and initiative. Among them, American tobacco, tung oil, and rapeseed oil have achieved the most remarkable results. The American tobacco planting area is almost all over the province, with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of stones. It is of excellent quality and sells well outside the province. The tung oil production area covers a total area of ​​approximately 200,000 acres, with an annual oil production of more than 160,000 stones. Rapeseed oil has always been a common winter crop in the province, with an annual output of more than 2 million dan of rapeseed. This year, after the provincial government issued an order to increase production in various counties, it also sent personnel to supervise the implementation on the ground. It is expected that the results will be even better next spring. Both tung oil and rapeseed oil are export materials, which are of great benefit to the construction of rural areas in the province and the prosperity of the national economy. However, most of Guizhou Province's export materials must pass through Guangdong. Guangdong's control over the transit of materials from neighboring provinces is extremely strict. For example, tung oil and rapeseed oil, all those that pass through Guangdong for export or are sold in Guangzhou, must be sold to the semi-official South China Trading Company for 60% of the price, and the price is lower than the market price, so the losses suffered by the business and agricultural circles in Guizhou Province are extremely significant. In order to promote agricultural production and regulate the supply and demand of materials, the authorities in Guizhou Province have ordered the relevant authorities to conduct in-depth research on how to develop inter-provincial trade and increase the production of export materials. It has recently been decided to establish the "Guizhou Products Transportation and Sales Company" so that the market can be centralized, the provincial government can supervise, and the large-scale needs of foreign countries outside the province can be met. It can also purchase essential important materials for rural areas in the province. Chairman Gu Zhenglun has appointed He Jiwu, Director of the Construction Department, and Zhu Maicang, former General Manager of the Gansu Provincial Bank, as the directors and deputy directors of the preparatory committee. The preparations have officially started on the 15th and are planned to be completed by the end of the year. The official establishment is scheduled for January next year.

### Chenjiaqiao Incident in Wuxi: Councilor Narrates the Process

[News from Wuxi, November 1] Regarding the report that villagers in Chenjiaqiao had a mutual assault incident with students from the Henan Joint Middle School, Councilor Cai Yan of Tianyi Township stated the facts as follows:

At about 7:00 AM on November 25, after the students of Chenjiaqiao Henan Joint Middle School were dismissed after being addressed in the playground, they passed through Chenjiaqiao Street, snatched sesame seed cakes to eat, and had a verbal conflict with the shop owner. The students then threatened the shop owner with bayonets and destroyed furniture, arousing public anger among the villagers. The students immediately fled back to the school. The villagers then rushed to the school to reason with the teachers. In the chaos, the furniture in the school was damaged. At that time, Hu, the district chief of Zhangcun District, who was in charge, immediately led a team to suppress the situation, persuaded the villagers, and had the school's Zu Bao punish the students who caused the incident and compensate the sesame seed cake shop for its losses. The villagers then dispersed.

An hour later, the students from Youjia Ancestral Hall and Laoye Temple in the township learned that the items in the school had been damaged, and they were furious. They rushed to various places with wooden sticks, triangular irons, and bayonets (the triangular irons and bayonets taken from the students have been handed over to Section Chief Mu of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters) and beat people indiscriminately, regardless of whether they were men, women, old or young. The villagers were unable to dodge and resisted, causing a mutual assault. At that time, the villagers Gu Jinquan, Cai Wudu, and Mao Shi were seriously injured (and are now receiving treatment at Wuxi Public Hospital), and dozens of others were slightly injured. At that time, when District Chief Hu learned of the incident, he immediately declared martial law and went to the scene of the incident with the councilor and Director An of the school to persuade them before they dispersed. He also sent the injured from both sides to the district office to find ways to treat them, and the assault stopped. The report that the villagers fired guns and beat gongs, and that the students jumped into the river and went missing, is not a matter of attack.

### Rural Reconstruction Committee Decides on Subsidy Plan

[Aviation News from Chengdu, November 2] Chiang Menglin, chairman of the Rural Reconstruction Committee, and committee members Yan Yangchu and others, came to Sichuan for six days to inspect Beibei, Baxian, and Bishan, and gained a good impression of the water conservancy in western Sichuan and the rural construction in eastern Sichuan. After careful consultation between the Chinese and American committee members, a preliminary subsidy plan was decided for rural construction in Sichuan Province, and a statement was issued before departure, including: (1) Subsidize 400,000 US dollars for the 11 water conservancy and irrigation projects in Sichuan that have started but not yet been completed, including the Heishihe Weir of Dujiangyan in Guanxian County, the Shiyang Weir in Chengdu, the Dahunian in Huayang, the Baixian Weir, the Qingjujie in Nanchong, and the Keting Weir in Santai, to help them complete the projects. After these projects are completed next spring, they can irrigate at least 191,000 acres of good farmland.

### Training Is More Important Than Everything: Jurong Receives Commendation

[News from Jurong, November 2] In order to establish the current special political style, County Magistrate Chen Tianzhi launched the "Talent Goes to the Countryside" movement as soon as he took office. Therefore, he first trained a group of intermediate-level cadres—township insurance attachments—together with Lishui County. Later, with "training determines everything" and "training is more important than everything," he further launched a universal training for lower-level cadres—bao team attachments. At that time, although the former County Magistrate Shi Qimin had stolen and sold all the grain in the county, and the county's finances were facing a dead end, for the sake of the above special importance, all sacrifices and difficulties were ignored and it was successfully completed. The Capital Garrison Headquarters issued a commendation for the unified development of mass organization training in the county.

### Underwear Exports to Southeast Asia Have Decreased by Half in the Past Month

In the past, the export of our country's underwear, through the coordinated efforts of various underwear factories, the Cotton Textile Joint Company, and the Textile Export Association, has been consistently well-received in the Southeast Asian market. The highest record was about 12,000 dozens of monthly exports, accounting for one-third of the monthly production of each factory. However, since November, due to the rapid rise in domestic power and wages, the number of foreign locks has decreased by one-half. The actual export volume in the previous month was only about 6,000 dozens. According to people in the industry, the current overseas price is about 900 Hong Kong dollars per dozen, while the Shanghai price is also about 600 yuan per dozen. Adding transportation, insurance, and other expenses, there is actually no profit to be made.

### Communism in China, September 1948, Compiled by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives

— Special Translation Elaborated by This Newspaper

(6)

5. The so-called "New Democracy" is merely a means to achieve coups and dictatorship, just as it manifested in Czechoslovakia in February 1948.

6. If a coalition cabinet of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must be formed, either party will have the right of veto and can overthrow the coalition government.

7. If this is the case, then a unanimous voting system must replace a majority voting system—the weakest political system in history.

8. If we cannot make a coalition government that accommodates the Communist Party effective in Berlin, Korea, Greece, or the European Recovery Program, how can we expect the Chinese to make it effective?

9. World peace based on freedom has not yet been established, and the security of the United States cannot be considered a trivial matter.

10. The expansion of Communist forces is enough to strengthen their means and ability to continue dividing the non-communist world.

11. The genuine independence of China is absolutely necessary for the security of the United States.

12. Without the assistance of other countries, China's independence cannot be sustained.

13. Although China is large, the assistance given to it can be much smaller than that given to Europe, and it can still be effective. China particularly needs technical advisors.

Each side has quick rebuttals to the reasons put forward by the other. Those who support aid to China give the following simple reply to the opponents:

"We will face a red China, which will strengthen the power of the Communist Party to dominate the world. Not only will you be surprised, but it will also be a major loss for us."

Opponents of aid to China reply to the supporters as follows:

"You cannot guarantee that your assistance can create a free, democratic, and strong China that can be self-reliant and help build world peace."

But those who support assistance will offer a final reply as follows:

"We certainly cannot guarantee success, but without assistance, the imminent loss of China is inevitable. Before China is irretrievably lost, we still have time to try and learn. Solving major problems takes time. Abandoning the entire problem and surrendering to the Communist Party is not the way to peace, but the road to war. If peace is possible, it is not because the dream of conciliation has become a reality today, but because we can quickly learn how to build a stable and strong non-communist world. We cannot win the race if we do not run. We cannot even stop the race from proceeding, because the other side is running. The prize of peace is placed at the end of the track, whether it is a peace of freedom, or a peace in the ashes of a world dominated by the Soviets."

E. American Mediation and Assistance

At the end of the war, the United States was entrusted with maintaining reconciliation between democratic countries and Soviet countries, and the hope of peace was placed on this. From the international cooperation of the United Nations to the quadripartite control of Germany, to the division of Korea into North and South, and even to the signing of peace treaties. This hope of reconciliation finally became a bubble. The Truman Declaration issued on March 12, 1947, can be regarded as the United States publicly acknowledging the irreconcilability between communism and democracy. Since then, the United States has continued to strive to make the dream of reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party a reality.

At the beginning of the "victory," the United States immediately endeavored to assist the various parties in China to establish a national unity agreement. Mao Zedong came to Chongqing on August 26, 1945, at the urging of Ambassador Hurley. In November, after the Chinese civil war had reached a serious stage, Hurley resigned, and then General Marshall was sent to China as a special envoy. On December 15, 1945, President Truman issued a statement on American policy toward China, recognizing the National Government as the legitimate government of all of China, but calling for national unity and stating that the United States would never interfere in Chinese affairs in a way that would "control the conduct of the Chinese civil war."

From August to November 1945, the United States seemed to explicitly support the National Government, while the Soviet Union remained silent. The negotiations between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong proceeded smoothly. However, Ambassador Hurley was attacked by American leftist groups, which weakened his credibility with the Communist Party.

General Marshall, with his immense prestige and strong will, maintained the negotiations until the point of failure. In January 1946, a ceasefire agreement was established; in the spring of the same year, the National Government and the Communist Party prepared to sign an agreement extending the scope of the ceasefire to the Northeast. However, before the agreement was signed, Marshall left China and returned to the United States, so it was never signed. On April 15, the Communist Party announced that the Northeast was in a state of war. A few days later, Marshall returned to China and continued to work for peace within China, until the spring of 1947, when he declared that he had given up his efforts and issued a statement on January 7, criticizing both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. From that time on, the United States recognized the state of civil war in China, and Chiang Kai-shek tried his best to make the United States aware that he had tried his best to avoid war, but by this time the war was already very fierce. In the summer of 1947, General Wedemeyer came to China to investigate the Chinese situation, but his report was never published. At this time, the United States finally changed its policy of refusing to provide assistance until unity in China was achieved, and the United States Congress finally passed a substantial aid to China bill in March 1948.

The CCP has always insisted on two special conditions in the negotiations. First, they insisted on self-organized troops, and the minimum condition for the establishment of a demobilization agreement was that the Communist Party must have eight divisions. Second, the Communist Party should occupy a certain number of seats in the cabinet, and this should be determined through fair political consultation. This is undoubtedly the policy of "New Democracy," which is the policy followed by the governments of Eastern European countries after the war.

The United States government, based on an assumption that communism and democracy could be reconciled, resolutely acted as a mediator in China, an effort that exceeded its limits. The kind of proposal that the United States made to the Chinese was unprecedented in history. The intention of the Communist Party to use seats in the cabinet has already been demonstrated in most countries today. In a coalition cabinet that accommodates a party intent on dictatorship, the fate of small parties has been clearly demonstrated in the first cabinet of Soviet Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution, and in the first cabinets of Mussolini and Hitler. In the above three cabinets, although members of parties other than the ruling party participated, that ruling party was cruel and ruthless, and the result easily turned into a dictatorship. From this point of view, it seems strange that some people occasionally express doubts about the sincerity of the United States in promoting peace talks, or about the sincerity of Chiang Kai-shek in conducting peace talks. The efforts of the United States to cater to the CCP went beyond the extent of compromise.

The two years of efforts by the United States to mediate have proven that it is impossible to form a democratic coalition government with the Communist Party, not only in China, but also in countries around the world. It is clear that "New Democracy" is merely a euphemism for the rapid transition from the proletariat holding power to the dictatorship of the proletariat. In March 1948, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US House of Representatives passed a resolution to provide China with military and economic assistance. This resolution was supported by the House and Senate, and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1948 was enacted and passed.

F. Weaknesses of the Chinese Communist Party

Communism in China has many important advantages and takes advantage of many favorable environments. But Chinese communism also has its weaknesses. There are several weaknesses related to the CCP's chances of achieving dictatorship. Other weaknesses relate to the CCP's ability to engage in construction after gaining power. The consequences caused by all its weaknesses are not that it can be ignored by us, but that it may and inevitably be defeated by us.

In recent years, those who oppose American aid to China have held very strange views. Some writers believe that the Communist Party cannot seize China, so there is no need to oppose it. Others believe that the Communist Party can solve China's problems, so we should not oppose it. These two views combine to form a reason that China can swallow its conquerors, like swallowing a dose of communist tonic. The conclusion of both views is that the United States need not worry. Although the CCP's weaknesses do not mean that we can ignore it, defeating it is not absolutely impossible.

The CCP's first obvious weakness is that communism cannot gain a large number of party members in cities, and cannot even seize important cities by force. The Communist Party's success is almost entirely limited to rural areas. They have never occupied a larger city for a long time. However, Marxism is said to be a doctrine suitable for industrial societies, that is, cities. This seemingly contradictory argument has two major reasons. The first reason is the existence of a state of civil war. In this state, even a weaker force can occupy remote areas and appear to be occupied for a long time, but it cannot occupy cities that can be reached by large armies. The second reason is the nature of the cities themselves.

The social and economic organization of Chinese cities is a complex mixture of old guilds (trade associations) and modern new facilities. Guilds are professional groups, whose members include old masters, employees, and apprentices, similar to the guilds of the European Middle Ages in many ways. There are also hometown associations, which unite people whose ancestral homes are in the same city. These groups aim to protect social security and promote the welfare of members, like the Freemason societies in the United States. If the organization of this kind of guild and hometown association system is strong, it can handle inland freight transportation and bear insurance responsibilities without documents. All transactions are based on honesty and credit. Although there are also things like self-interest, fraud, and usury, they are completely unique Chinese forms.

The Communist Party has the least power over cities organized in this way. Because labor groups have special forms, unlike the industrial unions in Europe and the United States, the Communist Party has nothing to seize. At the same time, this society with high loyalty and discipline can strike back with great force, can evade or break regulations, and can weaken the sharp weapon of bureaucratic politics, whether that bureaucratic politics is Kuomintang or Communist. The Communist Party has not gained a large number of people in these cities, so it cannot use force to control these cities.

The CCP's second weakness is the recent loss of its "New Democracy." Previously, the CCP could excuse its incomplete Bolshevik tactics as a neutralizing policy, rather than the product of having local power but no national power. This excuse also collapses. The changes in the scope of Chinese communism and the civil war have brought about many new problems and responsibilities, and gradually exposed the true face of its dictatorship.

These weaknesses do not mean that communism cannot win in China, but that it can only win by force. The view that stubborn peasants may defeat communism is still a dream. The Communist Party knows how to divide opposing classes and groups, and knows how to use the death penalty as an effective way to eliminate opposition.

The CCP's biggest weakness lies in the fact that it is helpless to solve several basic problems in China. China, unlike the Soviet Union, does not have vast land to accommodate the increasing population. It cannot solve its food problem by immigrating to border areas. It cannot purge dissidents and exile them to vast areas. China cannot sacrifice its current happiness to cultivate future war power. Once the Communist Party seizes power, it can only maintain its power by collectivization. In other words, the Communist Party must smash all existing Chinese economic organizations, must smash rural organizations and implement collectivization, and cause the civil war to spread to every village, as happened in Soviet Russia. This method cannot be implemented in a country with a huge population like China.

The Communist Party can only adopt the Soviet method, that is, the method of sacrificing the welfare of the people to accumulate capital, in order to build China's industry. Unless the Soviet Union completely changes its arms economy, it cannot provide economic assistance to other countries. American capital can give China the foundation for developing domestic capital. This is not force diplomacy, but raising the living standards of the Chinese people.

The above-mentioned weaknesses of the CCP do not mean that communism cannot win or gain power, nor does it mean that if communism wins in China, it cannot win in Southeast Asia. These weaknesses indicate that if communism wins in China, the loss of life will be uncountable; at the same time, they indicate that if the world has sufficient skills and determination, there is still hope of preventing this loss, and this hope is based on certain facts.

V. The Importance of China

A. China's Position in World Strategy

"The center of the world trend has gradually shifted to China. Anyone who understands this old country—in social, political, economic, and religious aspects—can answer the politics of the next five hundred years."

—US Secretary of State John Hay

Regarding China's strategic importance, it is sometimes discussed in terms of controlling the China Sea, or the bombing distance from various parts of China to various target areas, or the storage of military manpower. The scope of these discussions is too narrow.

Based on current speculations, the fate of the world in the second half of the twentieth century may develop as follows: At the end of this century, it may be a Soviet world; it may still be a non-communist world; or it may have been a world war.

The future fate of the world is tied to two major living systems, each represented by a powerful founder. We often overlook that the total number of people actually living under these two systems is only 600 million, accounting for about 28% of the total human population. Only this part of humanity can we say that their political system is communist or democratic. There are still 1.5 billion people who do not have much impact on the current balance, their politics only have the prototype of democracy, their economic situation is relatively backward, their use of natural forces is less common, and their productivity other than agriculture is far below the level of the modern West.

This group of people faces several general problems, and the way these problems are handled will determine the path they should take. Communism provides a simpler solution, industrial progress and strong political organization, but deliberately avoids the most difficult problem of human freedom. This is a more accessible solution, a labor-saving and brain-saving solution.

It is possible to make 1.5 billion people practice democracy, and to have freedom of enterprise in the economic field without threatening the freedom of communist social development. It is impossible to make them practice communism without threatening the freedom of democratic social development. The basic doctrine of struggle as communism does not allow that. Communism cannot allow peace to exist until it has spread throughout the world. It uses tactics and strategies to weaken and divide all independent institutions. This difference is strategically significant, because democracy needs more people to help it succeed than communism. Any huge gains made by communism make the non-communist world more vulnerable to economic, political, and psychological warfare—the Cold War. This gives the Communist Party a greater advantage. If democratic countries want to avoid regular wars, they will inevitably face the fate of chronic defeat, otherwise they will engage in regular wars to make up for the losses of the Cold War.

Among the 1.5 billion people who can lean towards democracy or communism, China is a decisive region. Its population accounts for nearly one-third. China is not a colony of any country. In this sense, it is a free country. It may be invaded by either side, and its domestic balance can easily be overturned by any powerful intervention. Its fate will determine the fate of half of the ethnic groups in the East. (To be continued)
