### Important Meeting in the Presidential Palace, Economic Departments Determined to Strengthen, Yu Hongjun Returns to Nanjing to Repeatedly Resign as Minister of Finance

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] After Weng Wenhao organized the new Executive Yuan, he spent the entire day of the 26th in contact with various related parties and again visited the President for instructions. Important meetings were held in the Presidential Palace both morning and evening. Although the candidates for Vice President, heads of various ministries and commissions, and both Chief and Deputy Secretaries-General have been largely decided, due to the need for further consultation and agreement with some, the announcement could not be made on the 26th. Political circles here generally hope that Mr. Weng can propose a list that meets public expectations with the utmost prudence, so that the new Executive Yuan lives up to its name and becomes a responsible cabinet, in order to complete the two major tasks of suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution. It is reported that Yu Hongjun, Li Weiguo, Wang Chonghui, Chen Lifu, Yu Bin, and others visited Mr. Weng one after another on the morning of the 26th to discuss matters such as the formation of the cabinet. It is said that Mr. Weng firmly invited Li Weiguo to serve as Secretary-General, and Li has already expressed his willingness to accept. In the afternoon, Mr. Weng also visited Zhang Lisheng, Yu Dawei, Yu Feipeng, and others. Discussions regarding the inclusion of members of the Min[zhushehui dang, Democratic Socialist Party] and Qing[nian dang, Youth Party] parties into the cabinet are also continuing.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] After Weng Wenhao took over as the head of the Executive Yuan, he decided to strengthen the relevant economic departments. The Executive Yuan originally established the National Economic Council (全經會). Mr. Weng believes that it is still necessary to establish it after the establishment of the new Executive Yuan. According to Article 14 of the new organizational law of the Executive Yuan: "The Executive Yuan may establish various committees within the Yuan to handle specific affairs." Therefore, the continued establishment of the National Economic Council has a basis in regulations. It is reported that after the establishment of the new Executive Yuan, the National Economic Council will continue to be established and strengthened. The position of Secretary-General of the Council was vacated when Lou Tongsun resigned and was approved during Zhang Chun's tenure as head of the Executive Yuan, and Gu Yulang has been appointed as acting Secretary-General. It is very likely that Gu will be formally appointed in the future. As for the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Gu's name is also highly mentioned, so Gu's new position will be one of the two, and the official announcement will be made after the new cabinet is formed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The President has recently issued an instruction to all directly subordinate agencies: "The Executive Yuan Organization Law, promulgated on March 31, 1936 [Republican calendar], and amended on December 25 of the same year, shall be implemented from May 25 of this year."

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun went to Shanghai to take over as Governor of the Central Bank. He returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 26th after completing his official duties. After disembarking, Mr. Yu immediately paid respects to the President and Premier Weng to report on the financial situation in Shanghai and the handover of the Central Bank. When reporters visited and asked if he was willing to continue serving as Minister of Finance in the new cabinet, Mr. Yu stated that he had repeatedly pleaded with the authorities to resign from the position of Minister of Finance. Now that the new cabinet has been established, it is only right to replace him with a new person to usher in a new administration, and he also feels deeply that his energy is insufficient, so he has no intention of continuing and has once again earnestly expressed his intention to resign to the authorities. It is also learned that the replacement of the Minister of Finance has been determined. After Mr. Yu returned to Nanjing, he instructed his subordinates to prepare for the handover. Qu Jingchun, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, also issued a notice on the 26th, scheduling a meeting with the heads of various units at 9:00 AM on the 28th to discuss the handover matters.

[Report from our newspaper] According to sources, after Zhang Jia'ao resigned from the position of Governor of the Bank of Communications, he has no intention of serving as Minister of Finance in the new cabinet, and will instead practically oversee the utilization of US aid. Gu Yiqun is more likely to assume the position of Minister of Finance.

### Organizational Regulations of the Constitutional Governance Supervisory Committee Promulgated

### Constitutional Governance Supervisory Committee Established on June 1st

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The Preparatory Committee of the Constitutional Governance Supervisory Committee held its third meeting at 3:30 PM on the 26th to discuss the organizational regulations of the committee and decided to establish it on June 1st. More than 200 committee members attended today's meeting. Chairman Li Hongru presided over the meeting. During the discussion of the organizational regulations, speakers were very enthusiastic. The committee had originally drafted two versions of the organizational regulations, which had not yet been decided. However, the Presidential Palace announced the organizational regulations of the committee on the 26th, which differed greatly from what the committee had drafted. During the extensive discussion, some committee members believed that the committee was an organization formed by representatives themselves and did not belong to a government agency. The government's order to appoint the chairman and vice-chairmen was not legal because the organizational regulations had not been subject to legislative procedures. Therefore, some committee members believed that it was not necessary to use the organizational regulations promulgated by the government order as the basis and instead proposed to elect committee members to review the draft prepared by the committee itself, which was approved by a majority of votes. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

Mr. Dong had resigned when Zhang Chun's Executive Yuan collectively resigned. Weng Wenhao is currently in discussions to persuade him to stay, but it has not yet been finalized. The press conference of the Information Office was still held at 3:30 PM on the 26th, but Mr. Dong did not attend because he had already resigned and was in a difficult position to "speak" during the transition between the old and new Executive Yuan. Only military spokesperson Deng Wenyi reported on the week's war situation before the meeting adjourned.

### Members of the Control Yuan to Report for Duty Starting Tomorrow, Session Scheduled for Two Weeks

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The first session of the Control Yuan under the Constitution will convene on June 5th, and members of the Control Yuan are scheduled to report for duty starting on the 28th.

The reception office has been prepared, and members of the Control Yuan from various locations will be able to receive accommodation upon arrival in Nanjing. The meeting venue is currently located at the Lizhi Society, and a hall is being added to the old site of the Legislative Yuan. It will be moved in after completion. Regarding the issue of the President of the Yuan, Yu Youren has not yet indicated that he will run for the position, but the vast majority of the more than 60 members of the Control Yuan in Nanjing have expressed their support for Mr. Yu to serve as the first President of the Yuan.

### Special Review Committee of the Legislative Yuan Discusses Issues of Various Committees

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The Special Review Committee of the Legislative Yuan held meetings on the 26th, both in the morning and afternoon. Chairman Cheng Tianfang presided over the meetings to discuss the issues related to various committees in the Organizational Law of the Yuan, which were referred to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Yuan. Six resolutions were passed: (1) The various committees will not have fixed conveners. (2) Each member shall only serve as a convener in the committee of their first preference. (3) The order of rotation for the conveners of each committee shall be determined by a single lottery. (4) The provision in Chen Guyuan's proposal that five convening members handle committee affairs on a monthly basis is unnecessary, and committee affairs shall be the responsibility of the secretariat staff. (5) The provision that each member may participate in three committees remains as in the original text of the organizational law. However, there were differing opinions on the number of members, with proposals for 199, 150, 99, 90, and 80 members, none of which were passed. They will be submitted to the Plenary Session of the Yuan for decision. The types and total number of committees will be discussed at the meeting on the 27th.

### Zhang Qun Flies from Chongqing to Chengdu to Treat Dental Problems and Will Return to the Capital to Handle the Handover, Denies He Will Take Office as Director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters

[Our Correspondent in Chengdu, 26th] Zhang Qun and Mayor of Chongqing Yang Sen flew to Chengdu at 5:00 PM on the 26th. Wang Lingji, Liu Wenhui, and others welcomed them at the airport. According to Zhang, he was very pleased with the significant progress in Sichuan's administration after being away from his hometown for more than a year. He will only stay in Chengdu for three days before returning to Nanjing to handle the handover. He avoided answering questions about his future position, but he expressed his deep appreciation for Weng Wenhao's organization of the new cabinet.

[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 26th] Zhang Qun, Yang Sen, He Beiheng, and others flew to Chengdu at 4:00 PM on the 26th. Before his departure, Zhang said that Weng Wenhao's assumption of the post of head of the Executive Yuan would help stabilize the currency system, balance prices, and ensure the success of US aid. In addition to being largely used for suppressing bandits, the remaining US$400 million, if properly coordinated and applied, could achieve three goals: (1) Replenishing supplies of grain, gasoline, cotton, and other materials to stabilize prices; (2) Reducing foreign exchange expenditures to balance receipts and expenditures; (3) Converting materials into legal tender to help balance the fiscal budget. Zhang also said that it would be difficult to implement currency reform in the short term. This trip to Chengdu is to seek treatment for dental problems at the West China Medical College. He denied the rumors that he would attend a meeting of the heads of Sichuan, Xikang, and Chongqing, saying that there was no need to deny them. Now that he has left Chongqing and is in the constitutional era, there is no need to speculate about his personal actions.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 26th] Zhang Qun said upon arriving in Chengdu: The rumors that I will take office as Director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters are purely fictitious.

Editorial

### Israel's Misfortune!

Since Britain announced the end of its rule and the birth of the new Jewish state, the Arab-Jewish conflict in Palestine has evolved into a large-scale war. With the combined support of the Islamic League countries, the Arab army gathered a mighty force of 100,000 and launched a fierce attack on the Jewish army. They are now at the gates of the capital of Israel. If there is no infiltration of external factors, the Arab army will force the half-month-old state of Israel to sign a treaty under the city walls, and the Jews will probably be unable to resist. At the same time, the devastation of the Holy Land is also inevitable.

However, the Israeli authorities, aware of the critical situation in the Holy Land, know that waiting for the United Nations Security Council to invoke the most effective provisions of the Charter to halt the war between the two sides is "too slow" to be "effective." Distant water cannot quench a nearby fire, so they have already sent an urgent appeal to the Security Council, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly immediately issue a ceasefire order, forcing the Jewish and Arab sides to cease fire first. Although the General Assembly has issued a ceasefire order to both Jewish and Arab sides, and limited it to noon on the 24th, the Arab army's offensive has not slowed down at all, and the Arab League has requested the Security Council to extend the ceasefire order for 48 hours in order to determine the final attitude. With the support of Britain, the Arab League's request was accepted by the Security Council, and the deadline for the ceasefire order was extended to noon on the 26th. During this period, the U.S. government instructed its envoys in Arab countries to try to persuade the governments of their respective countries to accept the ceasefire order issued by the General Assembly. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also sent a strong note to the Arab League countries, urging them to accept the General Assembly's ceasefire order. However, the representatives of the Arab countries deliberated repeatedly and have not yet shown any signs of changing their attitude, and the government of Saudi Arabia has been the first to frankly express its refusal to obey the Security Council's order to cease fire. Therefore, summarizing the reports from all sides, we can see that the possibility of the Arab countries accepting the General Assembly's ceasefire order is very small. In other words, it seems inevitable that the state of Israel will suffer a catastrophe soon after its birth.

However, the United States has always advocated the partition of Palestine between Jewish and Arab sides and has been secretly supporting the Zionist movement. Although it recently changed its attitude and advocated placing Palestine under United Nations trusteeship, as soon as the state of Israel was born, the United States rushed to recognize it in fact, indicating that the United States still supports the Jewish state. From then on, the state of Israel relied on the United Nations institutions and American aid. Although the United Nations institutions wanted to invoke the most effective provisions of the Charter to immediately stop the war in the Holy Land, the Security Council has not passed any resolution due to differences of opinion between Britain and the United States, exposing the weakness and incompetence of the United Nations Security Council and disappointing the Jews, who have no choice but to shift their hopes entirely to the United States. Therefore, the interim President of Israel, Weizmann, made a special trip to Washington to beg President Truman for help. For the sake of maintaining America's international standing and winning the support of American Jews, President Truman naturally had to "lend a hand" to the crisis of the state of Israel. It is expected that the United States will assist the Jewish state in the following two ways: (1) Supplying arms. According to Washington news, President Truman acknowledges that lifting the ban on arms shipments to Israel is a matter of urgency; (2) Economic aid. According to Washington news, Weizmann requested a loan of 100 million US dollars from the United States, which President Truman has agreed to consider.

If the United States continues to do so, its relations with the Arab League countries will inevitably deteriorate. Syria and Egypt, two Islamic countries, have announced a blockade of the Palestinian coast in order to prevent American supplies from reaching Israel, and have arrested forty-one Americans on American ships heading to Palestine. In theory, these actions violate international law, and the U.S. authorities have repeatedly protested to the Arab countries, but in fact, if the Arab-Jewish war cannot be stopped, these problems cannot be resolved.

We have always held an objective view of the Palestinian problem and believe that it is a problem of religious and ethnic differences. The partition of Palestine between Jewish and Arab sides, from the perspective of religion and ethnicity, has no reason to be opposed, so after the state of Israel was born, the major powers successively recognized it, and the reason lies in this. However, observing from another angle, Palestine cannot be compared with India. The geographical conditions and economic factors determine that Palestine should not be divided into two independent countries. If the partition is forced, creating two countries, then neither country will possess the conditions that a modern state should have. In this situation, the Arab people's sworn opposition to the existence of the Jewish state is not entirely without reason. Therefore, the Palestinian problem itself is a complex problem, not to mention the infiltration of external factors into the Palestinian problem, turning it into a place of great power political struggle, so the Palestinian problem has become the most perplexing problem for the world.

In the past, Britain ruled Palestine and adopted a "divide and rule" policy, not only failing to mediate the conflicts between the two sides and enable them to coexist peacefully, but also deliberately exacerbating the contradictions between Arabs and Jews, thus allowing itself to occupy a pivotal position. The Palestinian problem has not been resolved for more than thirty years, and Britain's policy toward Palestine cannot but bear some responsibility. Recently, Britain suddenly announced the end of its rule in the Holy Land, but secretly still supports the Arabs, not only directing the Arab League behind the scenes, but also blatantly assisting the Arab army. No fewer than forty or fifty British officers serve as commanders in the Arab army, and most of the arms used by the Arab army are also supplied by Britain. Therefore, the connivance of great power politics has not only intensified the open and secret struggle for the Holy Land between the Soviet Union and the United States, but also caused conflicts between Britain and the United States. Furthermore, the United States' vacillation and lack of a consistent policy have led to the tragic situation in the Holy Land today. This can be said to be the misfortune of both the Jewish and Arab sides, and also the major powers reaping the bitter fruit of their own actions.

In short, the Arab-Jewish conflict in Palestine has become the most perplexing international problem today. The only way to resolve it is for all the major powers to withdraw from the Holy Land and allow the Jewish and Arab sides to negotiate directly and peacefully resolve all the differences between them. Otherwise, even if the problem remains unresolved for a long time, it may not evolve into the most perplexing international problem.

### China Signs Tariff and Trade Agreement; Light Industry and Clothing Not Affected

[Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 26th] After China's representative signed the Tariff and Trade Agreement, there were concerns in the outside world about its impact on domestic industry and commerce. The reporter inquired with the Ministry of Finance on the 26th about the impact of the agreement on China. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry, the above-mentioned agreement was agreed upon at the Second Preparatory Meeting of the World Trade and Employment Conference in Geneva in 1947. The countries participating in the meeting included China, Britain, the United States, Canada, France, Australia, the Netherlands, India, and other eighteen countries. Based on the spirit of reciprocity, they agreed to mutually reduce import tariffs to promote bilateral trade. However, as China is an industrially backward country, in order to protect the nascent domestic industries, the Ministry, together with the Ministries of Economy and Foreign Affairs, carefully considered the matter before signing the protocol and instructed the representatives to go to the meeting to make further compromises. The scope of the current tariff reduction is extremely limited. Only 188 tariff items out of the 670 items in China's import tariff schedule are restricted, which is less than one-third of the total tariff items. Among them, 129 items maintain the original tariff rate (of which 80 items involve the entire item, and 49 items involve part of the item). Only 46 items have reduced tariffs (of which 36 items involve the entire item, and 10 items involve part of the item). In addition, for 13 items, part of the same tariff item maintains the original tariff rate, and part of it reduces tariffs. It is definitely not like the rumors in the outside world that all tariffs have been reduced. In terms of the specific amount of tariff reduction, the highest reduction is 10%, and the lowest reduction is 2%. In terms of the types of goods, the items with the most tariff reductions are metals and their products, such as automobiles, trucks, machinery, tools, tractors, and airplanes, totaling 59 items, which have no impact on China's light industry. The next most is food and beverages, such as wheat and flour, totaling 38 items. The next is chemical products and dyes, totaling 29 items, all of which are needed domestically. As for the extent of mutual concessions between China and other countries, a comparison can be made based on the value of goods. According to customs trade statistics in 1936 (the standard of normal trade before the war), the total value of goods for which China made concessions to various countries was approximately 250 million national currency, while the total value of goods for which various countries made concessions to China reached 320 million national currency, with the United States making the most concessions. The main items include soybeans, soybean oil, peanut oil, bristles, tung oil, tin, antimony, silkworm cocoons, raw silk, spun silk, camel hair, lace, embroidery, carpets, camphor, porcelain, hats and hat braids, hemp, eggs, and some cotton textiles, which are all important exports of China. Therefore, the agreement is actually more beneficial than harmful to China. Furthermore, the above-mentioned tariff reductions only apply to countries that have most-favored-nation clauses. Not all goods imported from any country can enjoy tariff reduction benefits. At present, China's import goods are still under foreign exchange quota allocation control. The above-mentioned tariff-reduced import goods will not be freely imported due to tariff reductions. Therefore, China's industrial sector still enjoys import restriction protection measures, so there is no need to worry about fulfilling the Tariff and Trade Agreement.

### Changshan Island, Penglai County, Placed Under Naval Administration

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Naval Headquarters News: The eight islands of Changshan originally belonged to Penglai County, Shandong Province.

It was not until last winter that our navy recovered them. The residents of the islands have suffered from the ravages of bandits and puppet troops for more than ten years and are eager for governance. They sent representatives Hu Wentang and Liu Jie to Beijing to request the Executive Yuan to follow the old practice and transfer them to naval jurisdiction. The Executive Yuan approved the transfer to naval control and command, but the general administrative system on the islands still belongs to the Shandong Provincial Government. The Naval Headquarters established an administrative bureau on the island on April 1 and appointed Xiao Zhengzhi as the director of the bureau.

### Ministry of Social Affairs Formulates Plan to Provide Relief to Refugees Nationwide; Estimated to Provide Daily Relief to One Million People

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Due to the spread of banditry and frequent natural disasters in China, according to reports from various places, the number of refugees nationwide reached 48 million last year. This year, the number of refugees is even greater, and the spring famine is severe, making refugee relief even more urgent. From last year to the present, the Ministry of Social Affairs has allocated relief funds and supplies totaling 493,509,480,000 yuan, more than 33,000 tons of food, and other cloth, clothing, cotton, etc. During the transitional period when the constitutional government is about to be established, 500 billion yuan has been specifically reserved for relief funds. In order to comprehensively handle national refugee relief, the Ministry of Social Affairs has formulated a plan for refugee relief in various important areas. After the implementation plans of each province and city are submitted to the Standing Committee of the Welfare and Relief Enterprise Review Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs for review and approval, they can be submitted to the Executive Yuan to handle the allocation of funds in batches by the American Relief Materials Committee and the American Relief Working Group. The main points of the plan are to provide relief to one million people every day. The target of relief is limited to refugees who cannot survive without assistance. Each person will be provided with 12.8 taels of food per day. The relief period will be three months, and every effort will be made to enable able-bodied men and women to participate in appropriate work relief, increasing production and helping them become self-sufficient. Those who can return to their hometowns will be assisted in returning to their hometowns and resuming their businesses. The total plan, excluding Qingdao, which has a separate plan, requires 34,200 tons of food. Estimated at the April food price this year, plus transportation and usage fees, the total cost is 25,086.6 billion yuan. The daily distribution of relief to one million refugees is as follows: Anhui 75,000, Jiangsu 100,000, Henan 100,000, Shandong 100,000, Hebei 95,000, Hubei 50,000, Rehe 30,000, Chahar 30,000, Suiyuan 30,000, Jiangxi 5,000, Shanxi 60,000, Northeastern Provinces and Cities 50,000, Gansu 10,000, Tianjin 30,000, Beiping 20,000, Xi'an 15,000, Shanghai 25,000, Nanjing 15,000, Qingdao 50,000, totaling 890,000 people. The remaining 110,000 people are reserved. In addition to sending personnel to Shaanxi and Hankou to investigate the disaster situation and determine the number of refugees to be assisted, preparations are being made to cope with emergency needs in the event of temporary disasters. Although the daily allocation of refugees to each province and city has been tentatively determined, it can be adjusted and decided according to the actual situation. Furthermore, Miao Jiaming, Director of the American Relief Working Group and the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Management of American Relief Supplies, feels that this plan is in line with the spirit of the Sino-American Relief Agreement and is giving it his support.

[Dispatch from Our Haikou Office, 26th] Military News: The large-scale encirclement and suppression campaign led by Han Hanying since his arrival in Hainan has come to an end. The bandit troubles in the border areas of Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, and Qiongdong counties, which have lasted for many years, have been completely cleared after being swept by powerful troops in different areas. In order to reduce the room for activity of traitorous bandits, the suppression troops ordered all counties to implement a five-household joint guarantee system. Having suffered continuous blows, the morale of the Hainan bandits is low, and there is extreme chaos internally. The bandit leaders are also using the pretext of party purification to eliminate dissidents, and middle and lower-level cadres are all in danger.

### Central Government Sympathizes with Silkworm Farmers' Hardships and Increases Spring Cocoon Purchase Price; Jiangxi and Zhejiang Production Expected to Reach 260,000 Dan This Year

100,000 Respond to General Strike, Turmoil in Finland Intensifies
President Considers Partial Cabinet Reshuffle
〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)
London, 26th Broadcasting: Helsinki dispatch, Finnish President Paasikivi is reshuffling the cabinet in an effort to resolve the crisis caused by the strike initiated by the Communist Party. Paasikivi has appointed Kilpi (belonging to the People's Democratic Union front controlled by the Communist Party) as Minister of the Interior to succeed Laine. Heljas has been appointed as Minister of Education, and Laine's wife, who is the real leader of the Finnish Communist Party, has been appointed as Deputy Minister of Social Affairs. Responsible parties say that the strike caused by the Laine incident will be stopped immediately.
〔路透社海爾辛基廿六日電〕(Reuters Helsinki, 26th)
The Action Committee of the People's Democratic Party announced that over 100,000 people in the Finnish capital responded today to the general strike called by the People's Democratic Party to force the government to appoint members of the party to the positions of Minister of the Interior and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. As of noon today, the turmoil has continued to escalate, with transportation workers engaging in slowdowns, threatening to bring transportation to a standstill. Independent and neutral opinions have begun to compare the current situation in Finland to the crisis in Czechoslovakia in February of this year. President Paasikivi convened a cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss candidates to succeed the Minister of the Interior, but no agreement was reached. The President intended to give the position of Minister of the Interior to Minister of Education Kilpi or Prime Minister Pekkala, but both have refused. Kilpi had originally succeeded Laine as Minister of the Interior, but resigned after the People's Democratic Party launched a protest strike. Last night, 86 factories in Helsinki, 71 in Turku, 30 in Lahti, and 10 in Tampere were affected by the strike. The Action Committee of the People's Democratic Party also stated that workers at the Helsinki power plant were planning to join the strike, but were dissuaded by the committee. The committee further stated that until the cabinet issue is resolved, workers must be vigilant to prevent the Communist Party from suffering discrimination similar to that before the war, but the strike must be disciplined, all provocative actions must be suppressed, and assistance from the authorities must be requested when necessary. Furthermore, anti-Social Democratic Party officials in the Ministry of Labor also acknowledged that the strike action is gradually expanding throughout the country.
〔路透社海爾辛基廿六日電〕(Reuters Helsinki, 26th)
President Paasikivi has ordered armed police riding express trains to protect workers who do not wish to participate in the strike. All government agencies are also guarded by armed police. At the same time, the Finnish cabinet is scheduled to hold another meeting this afternoon to find a suitable candidate for Minister of the Interior.
〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕(Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th)
Observers here today compared the current situation in Finland to the situation in Czechoslovakia during the coup in February, but pointed out that anti-communist forces are stronger in Finland than in Czechoslovakia. The Social Democratic Party, which holds a majority in Finnish labor unions, has resolved to oppose the Communist Party's strike action. One of the most serious aspects of the situation in Finland is not the demands put forward by the Communist Party, but the attitude and methods they used in making those demands. The Communist Party's organization, the "Action Committee," is reminiscent of the situation in Czechoslovakia at the time. The Communists in Helsinki are clearly trying to seize power in a "universally democratic" manner before the upcoming elections weaken their strength.

Arabs Insist on Annulment of Jewish State, Reply to Ceasefire Proposal Submitted Yesterday
Fiercest Battle Rages in Jerusalem
〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)
Lake Success Broadcasting, 26th: The Arab side's response to the Security Council's ceasefire proposal has arrived, but the contents have not yet been released. It is understood that the Arab side may accept the ceasefire proposal, but with three conditions: (1) Withdrawal of all recognition of the State of Israel; (2) Jews cease arming; (3) Restrictions on Jewish immigration into the Holy Land. The above three points are unacceptable to the Jewish side.
〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)
Lake Success Broadcasting, 26th: The Arab side insists that the Jewish state must be abolished and the Jewish army must be disbanded. Therefore, the Jewish side believes that it must reconsider its compliance with the Security Council's ceasefire order. In other words, the battle for the Holy Land will continue.
〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)
New York Broadcasting, 26th: Tel Aviv dispatch, Fierce fighting has been raging in the Holy City since dawn yesterday. Both Jewish and Arab forces are fighting with all their might. The Arab side launched a fierce attack, but was repelled by the Jewish side. The outcome of the battle is still uncertain.
〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕(Reuters London, 26th)
Authoritative sources in Cairo reported that Egypt has notified the Security Council, stating that King Farouk of Egypt has decided to reject the Security Council's ceasefire proposal for Palestine. Reports from other Arab countries indicate that all Arab countries have decided to take the same action. Egypt's rejection is based on the rationale that the entry of Egyptian troops into Palestine is to restore peace and order and to maintain humanitarian principles. According to Egyptian officials in Cairo, the Arab rejection of the ceasefire is a unanimous action, and Egypt is not acting alone. A dispatch from Amman also reports that Arab leaders met again this morning at Abdulla Palace, and are expected to conclude by noon. The joint response of the Arab League countries to the Security Council's ceasefire proposal will then be released in a communique.
〔合衆社台拉維夫邪惡六日電〕(United Press Tel Aviv, Evil 6th)
Tel Aviv, 26th, received reports that the Arab and Jewish armies in Jerusalem have thrown all their forces into battle. The fiercest battle in the city's 2,000-year history is raging wildly among the ancient Christian sites. The battle began at dawn on the 25th, with Arab forces attacking the Damascus Gate and Rachel's Tomb from the north and south of Jerusalem. The war reached its peak on the evening of the 25th. A Haganah spokesman said that the ceasefire in the Jerusalem area had become ineffective because Arab forces attacked the Old City after the deadline, and it cannot be reimplemented without an order from the Israeli government. Rachel's Tomb was captured by Arab forces on the evening of the 25th after a fierce attack by Egyptian forces. Arab forces on all fronts have gained the upper hand.
〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕(Reuters London, 26th)
Reports from the Holy Land over the past 24 hours indicate joy on the Arab side and pessimism on the Jewish side. Jewish forces in the Old City and the new city of Jerusalem have been surrounded by Arab forces. A British Broadcasting Corporation dispatch from Jerusalem said that Jewish forces in the Old City have been driven by Arab forces into a Jewish synagogue, where they have raised the banner of Israel, preparing to fight to the last man. The Arab forces have notified representatives of the International Red Cross, informing them that if the Jews in the synagogue do not surrender, the Arab forces will raze the synagogue to the ground with artillery fire. The Arab forces attacking the new city of Jerusalem have also made progress. Arab forces also said that the Arab army continued to win great victories on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. Jewish forces have been unable to rescue their comrades in Jerusalem. Arab aircraft also made their first sortie to bomb the Jewish forces in the new city of Jerusalem. The Transjordanian Legion fought fiercely with Jewish vehicles for 24 hours at Latrun on the road west of Jerusalem, killing more than 600 Jews. On the southern front of Palestine, the Egyptian army occupied the six southeastern peaks of Mamu Tair, thus cutting off the transportation line between Jewish forces and the Jewish areas of the Holy Land.

Lebanon Agrees to Release Detained American Jews
But They Must Return Directly to America
〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕(United Press Washington, 25th)
The State Department announced on the 25th that Lebanon has agreed to release the 41 American citizens arrested on American ships bound for Palestine, but they must return directly to America.

Marshall Consults with Austin Regarding New American Steps in the Holy Land
Britain to Issue Detailed Statement on the Situation in the Holy Land
〔中央社成功湖廿五日電〕(Central News Agency Lake Success, 25th)
The U.S. Secretary of State had lunch with Austin, the chief U.S. representative to the United Nations, at his residence in New York today. It is rumored that they discussed new American steps regarding the Palestine issue. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie and Security Council President Parodi were also guests.

Although officials claim that the lunch was purely a casual social engagement, it is generally speculated that Marshall and Lie at least used this opportunity to informally exchange views on the Palestine issue. It is also believed that Marshall and Austin secretly agreed on the steps that the United States should take in the Security Council if the Arabs do not comply with the ceasefire order, which took effect at noon on the 26th. Although the Security Council's ceasefire deadline has been extended by 48 hours to allow Arab countries time to consult, observers here are largely pessimistic about the hope that the Arabs will fully obey the Security Council. This outlook has become even dimmer after an Arab spokesman here stated today that the Arabs will not agree to an unconditional ceasefire. If the conditions demanded by the Arabs include the previously insisted upon dissolution of the State of Israel, then the Security Council's final call for peace to the Arabs and Jews may be of no avail, and the Security Council will have to redouble its efforts.
〔合衆社倫敦廿五日電〕(United Press London, 25th)
British Foreign Secretary Bevin told the House of Commons on the 25th that he will issue a statement on the 26th regarding the status of British officers in Arab armies. Bevin also promised to issue a detailed statement on the situation in Palestine later. Opposition leader Churchill instructed Bevin to remember the importance of maintaining neutrality. Bevin replied, "I have done this and understand it well."
〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕(United Press Washington, 25th)
Reliable diplomatic sources told this agency on the 25th that if the Arab and Jewish sides in Palestine do not declare a ceasefire, Britain is likely to prepare to allow the United Nations to repeal the British-Transjordanian Treaty.
〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕(Reuters London, 25th)
The status of British officers serving in the Transjordanian Legion has always been a subject of credible discussion in London. There are a total of 40 such officers, including Brigadier Glubb, commander of the Arab Legion. Related parties believe that the British government's decision on this matter will depend on the Arab countries' rejection of the Security Council's ceasefire order. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that Britain will determine its Palestinian policy independently, without interference from any other country, and that there are no ongoing negotiations with other countries on this matter.

United States Expected to Implement Military Aid to Europe Plan Next Year
Total Funding Required Approximately Six Billion Dollars
〔細社羣 頓廿五日電〕(Detailed Community, 25th)
Democratic Senator George predicted to reporters today that Congress will debate and pass next year the Marshall Plan to provide Western European countries with armaments to help them resist the threat of communism, at a total cost of between $3 billion and $6 billion. George stated, "The timing of its implementation depends on who is elected president and the speed with which the new president promotes this matter. However, I am confident that Congress will pass a bill to arm Western Europe within the next year." He also said that the U.S. should assist in improving Britain's navy and strengthening its air force. France is severely lacking in military equipment and must be completely re-equipped. He believes that if the Senate can pass Vandenberg's regional defense resolution, Western European countries will not find it difficult to obtain the armaments needed under the regional defense system.

Three Powers Send Liaison Officers to Police Headquarters
Soviet Union Takes Threatening Attitude
Berlin Crisis Shows Signs of Revival
〔路透社柏林廿五日電〕(Reuters Berlin, 25th)
Colonel Yelisarov, Soviet Deputy Commander of the Berlin Sector, today took a threatening attitude in protesting to the military governments of Britain, the United States, and France about the dispatch of liaison officers to the police headquarters in the Soviet sector of Berlin. Colonel Yelisarov claimed at the Berlin Deputy Commanders' meeting that these liaison officers had not obtained any special permits and had unilaterally stationed themselves in the police headquarters of the Soviet sector. The Soviet authorities may have to take the necessary measures to end the abnormal situation caused by this, which is an act that undermines peace and order in the Berlin sector. Brigadier General Bensen, the British representative and chairman of the Deputy Commanders' meeting, said that it would be a very serious situation if the Soviet authorities threatened the British representative and intended to prevent him from entering any institution jointly managed by the four powers. He asked Yelisarov what measures he intended to take. Yelisarov said that he did not intend to express anything other than the opinions he had already expressed. Observers believe that the long-dormant so-called Berlin crisis is showing signs of revival. After the outcome of the London Six-Nation Conference becomes clear, and the Western countries have reached an agreement to establish a West German government, it is almost certain that the Soviet Union will force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin.

True Color Photography, New Method Invented by French
A Great Revolution Will Erupt in the Film Industry
〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕(Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th)
French engineers, the Otis brothers, have studied true color photography for 17 years and have now invented a photographic method that is absolutely similar to real colors and is cheaper than any previous method. This new photographic method only requires a specially made lens, and other equipment is the same as black and white photography, and the film is the same as that commonly used. French filmmaker Bayour said that he will use this new method for his next film, "Miss Millstone." He said of the new invention: "This will bring a complete revolution to the film industry. Black and white films will disappear completely within the next two years, and forty-year-old women will no longer be able to play the roles of twenty-year-old girls."

U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report on Aid to China (2)
The Plan Recommended by the State Department
Under the current circumstances, it is difficult to formulate an effective long-term plan for China's economic recovery based on foreign aid from the United States. We must deal with the development of the situation step by step, as in all foreign aid plans. We must clearly state that our obligations are limited by the provisions of this bill.

Due to factual needs, this aid to China plan differs in several basic factors from the European Recovery Plan recently approved by the Senate. In Europe, it is possible to respond to American aid and make efforts for recovery and cooperation in a short period of time, but some of the basic factors of these efforts do not exist in the China plan. However, it is generally believed that this aid plan, aimed at meeting the most significant needs, will alleviate human suffering, give the hardworking Chinese people the opportunity to curb the rate of economic deterioration in China, and give the Chinese government another opportunity to launch a strong self-help plan. The committee believes that this plan is sufficient to encourage active democratic elements in China to "keep going."

The State Department's recommendation calls for providing $570 million in economic aid over a period of approximately 15 months ending June 30, 1949. Of this amount, $510 million will be used to meet the minimum level of necessary civilian goods imports, mainly food and raw materials, and the remaining $60 million will be used for important construction projects. This aid will enable China to use its own resources to procure other necessary imports and military supplies.

Detailed estimates and stipulations are not to be construed as obligations to China, but they are sufficient to provide a reasonable description of the scope of the plan. The plan must have sufficient flexibility and prudent management, as stipulated in the Economic Cooperation Act. The testimony made by the administrative department confirms that the needs and the possibility of obtaining such materials have been taken into account in this conceptual aid, and that providing such aid will not hinder the European Recovery Plan or the U.S. domestic economy.

A list of possible imports is as follows, the prices of which include costs, insurance premiums, and fees (prices are based on January 1, 1948): (1) Cereals (wheat and rice) $130,000,000, (2) Cotton $150,000,000, (3) Oil and oil products $110,000,000, (4) Fertilizer $30,000,000, (5) Tobacco $28,000,000, (6) Metals $24,000,000, (7) Medical supplies $5,000,000, (8) Coal $3,000,000, (9) Repair parts for existing important equipment $30,000,000. Total $510,000,000. This is equivalent to: wheat 225,000 tons, rice 451,300 tons, cotton 750,000 bales, oil and oil products 25,198,000 barrels, mainly from resources in the Eastern Hemisphere, with lubricating oils possibly being an exception.

Soluble fertilizers 40,000 short tons, obtained from North America.

Nitrogen fertilizers 411,100 short tons, South America supplying 32,100 short tons, Europe supplying 10,000 short tons, American tobacco 84,500,000 pounds, lead, zinc, aluminum, brass, and copper 17,588 metric tons, iron and steel (excluding scrap iron) 115,373 metric tons.

Repair parts for existing important equipment are also needed. The amount needed for each item is small, and in general, it will not cause serious problems.

Whether Shanghai People Love Their Country, Special Relief Donation is a Touchstone
Mayor Donates 500 Million Yuan from Wife's Art Exhibition Proceeds to Take the Lead
〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)
The Shanghai Special Relief Donation Solicitation Committee invited responsible persons from various industry and commerce guilds and native-place associations for a discussion at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3 p.m. yesterday.

Chairman Wu Guozhen stated that the solicitation of special relief donations in the Shanghai area will not be like the compulsory enforcement in Beiping, but will be based on the principle of voluntary donations, with a deadline of the end of June. The special donation is not a levy, and the donations are purely out of patriotism and a willingness to do good. Whether or not the names of the donors are published will be up to the donors. He hopes that the responsible persons of each guild and native-place association will persuade their members to donate separately, and submit a register of donors and the amount of donations to the committee before June 10, in order to complete the target of 85 trillion yuan in the shortest possible time. If the solicitation committee believes that there are omissions, it will ask for supplementary donations based on the detailed roster prepared after investigations from all parties. The roster will not be made public for the time being. Mayor Wu also announced on the spot that although he has no permanent property, in order to express his patriotism, he will donate 500 million yuan in legal tender from the foreign exchange earned by his wife (Ms. Huang Zhuoqun) at a recent art exhibition in Manila, to take the lead.

Those present at the meeting yesterday included solicitation committee members Pan Gongzhan, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiyu, Wu Kaixian, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng (represented by Tang Shichang), Fang Zhi, Qin Runqing, Li Shizeng, and responsible persons from various industry and commerce guilds and native-place associations, totaling more than 300 people. First, Wu Guozhen, who also served as chairman of the committee, explained the significance of the special relief donation, and then invited two commissioners, Jiang Yong and Liu Butong, specially dispatched by the central government to Shanghai to provide guidance, to address the meeting. Jiang Yong stated: The relief cause should have been fully implemented by the government. Due to the increasing number of refugees and the government's financial difficulties, it is unavoidable to ask social figures from various provinces and cities to donate generously to assist the government in completing this arduous task. At present, the victims are all people from rural villages or small counties. It is hoped that people from large cities, especially those with wealth in Shanghai, can do their best to provide relief out of compassion. Liu Butong said: History tells us that when most people have no food to eat or clothes to wear, a few people cannot live in peace for long. At present, wealth in China is concentrated in several major cities, and Shanghai is the largest city. Therefore, he sincerely hopes that powerful people in Shanghai can contribute all they have to the country. Liu also said that the first step in Shanghai's fundraising method is voluntary donation, and the second step may also take extraordinary measures. He believes that wealthy people in Shanghai will definitely donate willingly without the need to take extraordinary measures. If they have money but are unwilling to donate, they will inevitably lead to a situation where those with strength are unwilling to contribute.

Everyone Must Have the Spirit of Destroying Their Homes to Relieve the National Crisis
Li Shizeng, Fang Zhi, Wang Xiaolai, and Xu Jiguang also delivered speeches one after another. Li Shizeng hoped that society would solve all social problems. Fang Zhi hoped to have the spirit of destroying their homes to relieve the national crisis. Wang Xiaolai said that patriotism starts with each individual's love for their country, and this donation is a touchstone for whether Shanghai people love their country. Xu Jiguang said that the special relief donation is definitely not a levy, and its target is aimed at people, not industries. He hopes that representatives of each guild and native-place association will enthusiastically persuade their familiar members of their respective industries or native-place members to donate. In this severe situation where the military situation has not ended, there is no hope for improvement in industry and commerce. To end the military situation and improve industry and commerce, each industry should provide more assistance to complete this task.

Mayor's Initiative Received Applause
Finally, Mayor Wu reported that voluntary donations in the city would be made freely before the end of June. After June, those who are on the planned roster but have not donated will be subjected to the next method. Donors donate purely out of patriotism, and it does not mean that those who donate have been corrupt or upstarts, so those who wish to publish their names will publish them, and those who wish to keep secrets will hide their names. Donors who have already donated in one industry will not be asked to donate again in other industries or native-place associations. Finally, Mayor Wu donated 500 million yuan to take the lead, and said that there may be 50,000 to 100,000 people in Shanghai who can donate 500 million yuan. He hopes that people will enthusiastically donate, winning warm applause from the participants. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.

The Jinjinzhai Rong Restaurant at No. 1330, Changning Road, was negligent on the 27th of last month, and the fire spread to more than 100 shantytowns in the Xishi market.

Investigation of Suspected Concealment of Bandits, Xuhui District Chief Humiliated
Cheng Shi, the district chief of Xuhui District, was forcibly arrested and humiliated by three unidentified persons at around 3 p.m. on the 24th. According to Cheng, at that time, a person wearing a Western suit who claimed to be surnamed Jin held a letter and said that there was a secret and he needed to talk outside. When he got outside, he saw two people waiting outside. One of them showed a pistol and threatened him to go with them. Cheng refused the illegal arrest by Jin and others and resisted, but because he was weak, Jin and others handcuffed him. While they were arguing, Director Zhang of the Xuhui Police Station arrived after hearing the news and took Jin and others to the station. Cheng also went with them. The station director then telegraphed the police headquarters and the civil affairs bureau for instructions. Subsequently, Section Chief Lu of the Civil Affairs Bureau arrived. After questioning Jin, it was learned that Jin was sent by the Zhejiang Provincial Police and Security Office to investigate whether Cheng had concealed bandits. He was not ordered to arrest him. Moreover, Jin and others did not notify the Civil Affairs Bureau according to legal procedures, but directly and arbitrarily arrested and insulted him, which was even more wrong. After Director Zhang and Section Chief Lu criticized him, Jin and others silently left. District Chief Cheng also said: (1) I am waiting for the authorities to investigate whether I have any bandit case. (2) I have been illegally arrested and innocently humiliated. In addition to reporting to my superiors, I will file a lawsuit according to law.

### Yang Mei Once Grabbed Fried Rice Candy; Dr. Peng Guangqin Expresses Doubt Over the Health Bureau's Urine Test Results

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 25th] Yang Mei now weighs 84 pounds, with an oral temperature of 92 degrees, unchanged from before. According to someone from Shi Gui: Senator She Deyi originally planned to bring Yang to Chongqing last November, but because Yang had grabbed fried rice candy from a roadside vendor en route, fearing ridicule, he delayed the trip until this year. Therefore, Director Li instructed Yang Mei today not to force herself to eat anything. However, as of 4:00 PM today, she still had not passed stool. Furthermore, according to Dr. Peng Guangqin, Director of the Chongqing Economic and Industrial Institute, he doubts the Health Bureau's urine test results for Yang Mei, believing that regardless of whether she eats or not, there should be protein detected. Also, the "oral temperature of 32.2 degrees" published on the 21st was a mistake for 92.2 degrees. Additionally, Yang's sputum contains glucose bacteria, and she has bad breath.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 26th] Yang Mei still weighs 84 pounds today and has still not eaten or passed stool. Zhuo Songdai met with Li Zhiyu today and heard that the observation period of the 21st had expired, and it was decided to move her to Zhuo's residence in Jiulongpo for continued observation, still accompanied by two nurses from the Health Bureau. Director Li has not yet made a final decision with Yang Sen regarding the next steps, including the selection of examining experts and equipment, but has promised to consider it.

### British Build Highway on the Border of Kang and Tibet; Sedia to Ningyu Line Scheduled for Completion by Year's End; Chongqing Pacification Headquarters Orders Kang and Yunnan Provinces to Collect Evidence

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 26th] Regarding the British surreptitiously building highways in the Kang-Tibetan border areas of Moluo, Ningyu, Bomi, etc., the Chongqing Pacification Corps has ordered Kang and Yunnan provinces to pay close attention and to find ways to collect evidence to serve as a basis for forceful negotiations. The Yunnan Provincial Government has also instructed the regional commissioner's office to order the neighboring governing bureaus of Defan, Gongshan, Fugong, Bijiang, and Lushui, which border Kang and India, to conduct thorough investigations and report details. According to confirmations from Lijiang, the highway being built from Sedia (a secret territory of India's Assam) has not yet reached Ningyu, and is currently being constructed northward from Walong, about 100 Chinese miles southwest of Ningyu. The conditions are that Tibetan merchants are allowed to transport 500 loads of wool and cloth from Sedia each year, and that the export of firearms, cotton yarn, medicine, and daily necessities is specially permitted with limited quantities. Furthermore, according to reliable sources: after the completion of the Sedia-Ningyu highway at the end of the seventh year, there are plans to extend it to Sang'ang in the northeast, and then northward to Qamdo. Passing through Bomi and Tatzog, it can reach Assam, so entering Tibet from India can bypass Yunnan. Tibetan official Dongma Ben had already gone to Sedia three months ago to negotiate. The Chongqing Pacification Headquarters considers this matter of great importance to national territorial sovereignty and national defense security, and has reported the details to the highest authorities. Furthermore, according to a merchant from Ningwalong in the Kang region: There is a small path from Ning that leads directly to India's Yuanyongli. The road is narrow and impassable for vehicles and horses. At Wulongdi, three days' journey from Ning, the British army has built a thatched house, surrounded by a mud wall with a ditch around it, and stationed more than forty Indian military officers and soldiers. In another location, six or seven days' journey from Ning, there is a large stone with inscriptions in English, Chinese, and Indian. The Chinese text reads, "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from afar?" The locals say this is the border between Kang and India.

### Songgu Yisheng, Sergeant of the Enemy Military Police Team Stationed in Songjiang, Was Sentenced to Death Yesterday

[Our Report] Japanese war criminal Songgu Yisheng, a former sergeant in the Songjiang branch of the Hangzhou Military Police Team, was sentenced to death by a military court yesterday. The main text of the judgment stated that "Songgu Yisheng violated international law during the war by killing non-combatants and should be executed." Songgu Yisheng was lawless and brutal during his tenure at the Songjiang Military Police Team, and countless local residents suffered from his poison. For example, on March 30th, he burned villager Lu Youchang to death in Youtou Ru and threw his body into the river. He also shot and killed Zou's wife at the Zhangjia East Bridge and burned down several of Zhang Jiming's houses. Similar crimes committed during the thirty-fourth year are too numerous to count. After the victory, the families of the victims reported him and testified in court. Although the criminal tried to deny it, the evidence was conclusive and could not be refuted. The court therefore sentenced him to death according to law and will report to the Ministry of National Defense for approval before execution.

### Increase in Foreign Exchange Settlement Figures from Designated Banks, Export Trade Gradually Showing Improvement

[Our Report] According to news from the Export Administration Commission: From the 1st to the 22nd of this month, the foreign exchange settlements for exports through designated banks in Shanghai alone have reached approximately 9.2 million US dollars. The settlement figures for other ports such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Taiwan, and Guangzhou are not included. Among them, fresh eggs, fruits, frozen eggs, and egg products are in peak season and account for a larger amount, totaling 2.6 million US dollars. Yarn and knitted goods totaled 1 million US dollars, tea totaled 900,000 US dollars, and leather goods, pork floss, and textiles totaled 500,000 US dollars. Therefore, there is no doubt that the total export settlement for this month will exceed that of April. If there are favorable factors in the next two weeks, it is possible to break the record for settlement figures in previous months, it is said.

[Another Report] Huo Baofeng, chairman of the Export Administration Commission, submitted his resignation a few days ago, stating that he had made little contribution since taking office and requested that another capable person be selected. At that time, there was no reply.

### Sellers' Intentions Increase, Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Flour Prices Fall Again, Oil Market Rises

The rice market continues to fall. Because production areas reported a significant drop in prices the day before, sellers' intentions are stronger. Moreover, the Civil Administration Commission is releasing 6,000 dan of rice per day, but actual sales are sluggish. Yesterday, there were formal transactions within the market, but they were all second-class old rice and indica rice, because of the price limit; high-quality goods were priced higher.

The market price in Beishi for white japonica and thin rice was 5.98 million yuan, and for white yuan, it was 7.5 million yuan, about 200,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The prices outside the market also fell again. High-quality white japonica initially sold for 6.2 million yuan, but later rose slightly to 6.3 million yuan. Thin rice and early rice fell by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan each. Registered arrivals at the market totaled 2,569 dan.

Flour prices fell again. The Central Trust Bureau's released flour price also decreased by 50,000 yuan, to 2 million yuan delivered. Old car, warship, and warehouse receipt transactions were more active. Initially opening at 2 million yuan, retail buyers and the northern gang took advantage of the low prices and raised it to 2.05 million yuan, reducing it by 50,000 yuan. Spot prices were lower than warehouse receipts by 30,000 to 70,000 yuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng closed at 2 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour were actively cleared out in the streets and inland areas, with many transactions. Peacock closed at 2.06 million yuan. Bran fell by 20,000 yuan.

Coarse grains initially weakened but later strengthened. When soybeans initially opened, many sellers wanted to sell due to the large number of returns from the previous day, and early soybeans initially opened at a low of 3.2 million yuan. Later, bean cakes and oil prices rose, and factory buyers frequented the market, causing prices to rise to the original price of 3.35 million yuan, not much different from the previous day. Transactions of selected green beans were still rare, and prices were unchanged. As for corn, because the Yantai gang had ship positions, they absorbed a large amount, raising it by 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum also rose by 150,000 yuan. The Bengke gang took few mung beans, and the market rose slightly by 100,000 yuan. Sesame saw little fluctuation, and raw peanuts rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

Edible oil stopped falling and rose. Retail buyers took advantage of the low prices to absorb supply, and actual sales were also active. Sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices. Recycled soybean oil initially opened at 14.4 million yuan, and then rose all the way under the absorption of retail buyers, reaching a final price of 15.2 million yuan for Dalian soybean oil, up 500,000 yuan. Raw oil rose by 700,000 yuan. Raw peanut oil in Jiton barrels was 17.2 million yuan. Raw rapeseed and sesame oil both rose by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, and small car sesame oil rose by 500,000 yuan. Bean cakes initially rose slightly, and then the Shantou gang increased purchases, raising it by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.

### Wenzhou Zhenmei Tea Rises

Upon investigation of red and green tea varieties, since the leaders emerged and jacked up prices, the trend has shown signs of improvement. In terms of prices, they have also consistently maintained strength. Moreover, the asking price for this year's Wenzhou Zhenmei tea from Luzhuang and Shizhuang, etc., in the process of 复製繳用步砌, is even higher than before. As a result, the price per dan has increased by more than 1 million yuan. However, due to foreign countries complaining about high prices, export traders have no choice but to stand by, so there is a lack of actual transactions. As for domestic sales tea, apart from some scattered additions in this street, the routes to places such as Tianjin are still narrow, and the transaction volume is very small.

### Japanese Reparation Machines Arrive Continuously, Processing and Allocation Prices Still Undecided

[Our Newspaper] The Japanese reparation machines received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for allocation to private factories, since the first batch arrived on January 22 this year via the Haikang wheel, have continued to arrive in ten batches via the Haizhe, Yongxing, Huzhou, Limin, Changli, Haiji, and Haisu wheels. To date, a total of 1,446 pieces of large and small machines have arrived in port. It is expected that four more batches will arrive before the end of June this year. Then, the first phase of the reception work can be concluded. The deadline for factories to apply for allocation and pricing was April 15 this year, but there is still no news on the handling method. The machines have been shelved for too long, and there is concern about rust. The reporter inquired about the details with the responsible department of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday. It is reported that the machines are packed well. The inner layer of the wooden boxes is lined with tar paper, and the surface of the machines is coated with butter. Heavy machinery is piled outdoors, covered with tarpaulins, and padded with sleepers to shield it from wind and rain. This waterproofing equipment can generally last for six months. However, some machines were delayed while awaiting shipment in Japan. Now, if the storage period is too long, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no rust. However, the Guidance Office, limited by funds, is already struggling with storage, handling, and loading and unloading costs. If there is rust, it will be helpless. Fortunately, when inviting people from all walks of life to visit last time, 20 boxes of machines were opened, and there was no rust. Therefore, it is speculated that even if there is rust, it should be a very small number. On the one hand, the Ministry's handling of the Japanese Reparation Committee is also expediting the review. After all, the first batch of machines totals only 1,601 pieces, but more than 10,000 pieces have been applied for allocation by various factories, which takes time to review. However, it is expected that there will be results in the middle of next month, so that the allocation and processing can be carried out successively.

### New Law Schools Do Not Differentiate Departments; Schools Should Not Regard Them as One Department; Operating Expenses and Allocation Quotas Must Not Be Reduced

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Education recently telegraphed National Zhejiang, Tongji, and Lanzhou Universities, stating that many schools, because the new law schools do not differentiate departments, regard them as one department and reduce the allocation of funds, which defeats the purpose of concentrating efforts and developing legal education. The law schools adopt a non-departmental system, specializing in legal studies, which should be the same as the non-departmental system of medical schools. They should not be regarded as one department. In the future, the allocation of operating expenses to the law schools of each school should be based on the school, not calculated as one department, and the allocation quota should not be reduced in order to emphasize legal education.

If you take office rashly, will you be able to continue to promote the college's excellent traditions? (2) You are from Nanyue, and there are rumors that you intend to keep our college permanently in your hometown. This is contrary to the consistent position of all teachers and students of our college to 'move to Beijing and change the name to university.' If you take office and hinder the development of the college, how can you feel at ease? (3) Currently, the teachers and students of the college have gone on strike to express their rejection of your appointment. If you disregard the facts and affect the future of the college, how will you face the teachers and students of our college? Our association loves our college and cares about the future of teacher education in our country. Therefore, we put forward the above three points, and we hope you will consider them carefully."

### Donghua Unleashes Its Power, Defeating the British Navy Five to One; Allied Forces Suffered a Miserable Defeat

[Our Newspaper] The Donghua football team unleashed its superb and powerful strength yesterday, defeating the Allied Forces team five to one. The team comprised ships from the British London and the Lucus. By half time, Donghua was dominating with a four to one lead. This score is noteworthy as the first match for the British Navy.

East Park was extremely crowded, with about 5,000 people. The referee was Li Guoyi, and the linesmen were Yue Xiuying and Wang Chongye.

Donghua Played Splendidly: Donghua worked very hard and played splendidly. Goalkeeper Chen Huimin saved dangerous balls, bravely and agilely, and is a promising talent. Because Donghua's defense was strong, the British forward's mobility was greatly reduced. Midfielder Han Nibo was good at both offense and defense. The intense offensive shooting from forwards Chen Mingzhe, Han Longhai, and Li Yao was Donghua's best performance in many days. The British Navy was busy defending, and the offensive power of its forwards was greatly reduced. The whole line was chaotic, and there was no good communication, which was much worse than the previous day. Except for center-back Xuegesi, there was little to admire.

A Draw: Donghua attacked first. After about ten minutes of melee, British center-back Xuegesi touched the ball with his hand. Old Sun took the penalty, but his shot went wide. Soon after, Youliang went deep, and Mao Shiman forced a corner kick. Youliang kicked it, and Li Yao, with perfect positioning in front of the goal, scored the first goal. The British army counterattacked. Griffin charged alone, and Chen Huimin rushed out. Griffin kicked and shot, hitting Chen's foot. Ford dribbled the ball and passed to the center, and Hatcher low-shot into the net, leveling the score at one to one.

Three Consecutive Goals: Donghua attacked again. Chen Mingzhe dribbled the ball quickly, and Mei Taisi intercepted it carelessly, injuring his ankle, and Lin Mansi replaced him. After 25 minutes, Youliang passed to Han Nibo, who fired a long shot from 25 yards out, scoring another goal. Two minutes later, Mingzhe got the ball and passed to Youliang, Jia Tiao and A Sun, made a cross, and Li Yao forcibly shot the ball from the baseline, making it three to one. At half an hour, Longhai charged into the middle like a horse unleashed. By half time, Donghua was dominating with a four to one lead.

Longhai Dangles

After the break, Zhang Lingen replaced Qia Xing, and Zhuang Youren and Jin Chuanhan came on the field. The British army's situation was more stable than before, and the counterattack was strong, but the shooting was inaccurate, wasting effort. Until the 28th minute, Youliang launched an attack from the wing and made a wonderful pass to the center. Longhai made a backward hooking shot, hooking the ball into the net, making it five to one, and Donghua sent the British Navy packing. The British Navy had originally planned to play friendly matches with Jiaotong University, etc., but because it had to leave Shanghai for Taiwan today, it gave up.

The Xu Hui High School soccer team played against the British Navy's HMS London soccer team at the Xu Hui field at 4:00 PM yesterday. Commander Lin Hui of HMS London represented Commander-in-Chief Bao Yide in performing the opening kickoff ceremony. Former Xu Hui players Zhuang Wenquan, Luo Shoufu, and Gu Yisa all returned to the team to serve, making their strength even more abundant. After the start of the match, Little Luo opened the scoring first, followed by Xu Zuguo adding another goal. The British sailors lost two goals in a row and tried hard to counterattack, but Xu Hui's defense was impregnable, and their efforts were in vain. Soon, Li Shunsheng penetrated deep on the right wing and scored a goal. When Little Luo scored again, the first half ended, with Xu Hui leading by four goals.

After changing ends, Xu Hui replaced Liu Chengmin with Zhen Deren. The British Navy made no changes. After contact, Xu Hui's Little Luo became more and more courageous, scoring two more goals in a row. The British soldiers were unwilling to give in and the forwards advanced, attacking relentlessly. Finally, the center forward recovered one goal, but the Xu Hui youngsters maintained their remaining strength, and Little Luo and Xu Zuguo each scored a bullseye in succession. When time ran out, Xu Hui won a big victory with a score of eight to one. Xu Hui's lineup was as follows:

Yu Gengcang Sun Yongda Fang Shansui Liu Chengmin Zhen Deren Gao Zhiwen Xu Zuguo Luo Shoufu Gu Yisa Li Shunsheng

### From Ideological Transformation to Political Reform: Reading "Thought, Morality, and Politics" by Hu Qiuyuan, Published by New China Publishing House

— Binzhi

The eight-year War of Resistance only yielded a fleeting victory. The post-victory scene was one of internal strife and destruction, the complete opposite of what was expected, causing many to feel deeply distressed. Many people put forward ideas for improvement, in all sorts of forms and varieties. Mr. Hu Qiuyuan's proposal to proceed from the ideological and moral aspects to political reform is indeed a profound and unique perspective.

Mr. Hu recently compiled his 29 essays into a volume entitled "Thought, Morality, and Politics," which represents his views. The book is divided into three units: eight articles on thought, seven on morality, and fourteen on politics. Each article can be read independently, but from the book as a whole, there is a consistent system, and there is no lack of coherence.

Regarding thought, the author advocates freedom, so he begins with thought and freedom and ends with neo-liberalism. He discusses the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western thought, their characteristics, and the evolution of Chinese thought after being influenced by Western thought in the past century, pointing out the contradictions. The author believes that thought is the driving force behind all actions, and the transformation of thought is the foundation of all reforms. Rational and free thought can restore our clear wisdom. Neo-liberalism is the path to ideological reform. Hu's neo-liberalism combines movement, evolution, and creation into one, developing the original performance from historical evolution and natural activities. This original performance is the most virtuous and reasonable, without harming others or other things. If the inherent performance of human beings can be fully developed, society can move towards progress, and the world can achieve peace.

From free thought, he proposes a new moral creed of "establishing oneself and establishing others, achieving oneself and achieving others," which is the center of the author's discussion of morality. Thought is personal, morality is social. In today's China, the old morality is declining, and the standards of the new morality have not yet been established, resulting in the chaotic phenomenon of today. Originally, morality does not distinguish between old and new. As long as the value and dignity of morality are restored, the light of human nature is restored. What counts as virtue? Mr. Hu only put forward four simple words: "diligence" and "courage" are the elements of tempering oneself, and "benevolence" and "sincerity" are the foundation of treating others. Being able to possess four virtues is the way to be a person, which is the way to succeed. Especially for young people, in addition to having a good foundation of knowledge, they must also have character cultivation, which is the original capital for career success.

Finally, discussing politics, many people now take old or misunderstood ideas as a starting point for their views on politics, and use secular and unreasonable moral standards as rules. This is why internal strife in China and contradictions in the international community have arisen. Hu proposes that rebellion has political factors, so suppression must be carried out through both military and political means in order to eliminate the source of the chaos. The transformation of politics must have a basis, it is necessary to understand the background of history, to understand the international situation, and at the same time to establish the goal of nation-building, so that political reform can be effective. The author proposes that the current political reform in China should take "winning people's hearts and establishing prestige" as the basic principle. Make the people have confidence in the government, and obtain the cooperation of the people of the whole country, so that the war will gradually shrink and order will gradually be restored.

Political reform is not a matter for one or two people, but the result of the joint cooperation of the people of the whole country. To enable everyone to engage in this arduous work, it is necessary to start with the ideological and moral reform of each individual. Now that the constitutional government has just been established, I would like to introduce this book to every young person, so that young people can transform themselves ideologically and morally, and then jointly engage in political reform. Then the turning point of the fate of the Chinese nation can be expected to arrive.

### Introduction to Modern Academic Culture

— Qian Dacheng

Edited by Zhu Kezhen et al., Edited by Zhang Qiyun

Published by Huaxia Book Company, Price: Six Yuan

According to the author's preface to "Introduction to Modern Academic Culture," it will be divided into four parts: (1) Humanities, (2) Social Sciences, (3) Natural Sciences, (4) Applied Sciences. The first volume, published in March this year, is now being introduced. This book includes ten essays, written by professors from various universities. Mr. Zhu Kezhen's "The Method and Spirit of Science" has a thoughtful conclusion that is thought-provoking and worthy of being the authority of the scientific community. He said: "Love of peace is a characteristic of the Chinese people, and the more developed science is, the more狰狞 and terrible war becomes, and the more the world has to achieve peace. How can we make the future world continue to develop science on the one hand, and achieve peace on the other hand? This is a very serious problem at present, and it is also a problem that our Chinese should make special contributions to." Mr. He Lin's "Confucian Thought" believes that the characteristic of Chinese culture is still Confucian thought, or Neo-Confucian thought. The proposition seems old, but it is actually novel. His views are similar to those of Mr. Feng Youlan in his book "New 理学," not aiming to be innovative or different. Is Mr. He's "New Theory of Confucian Thought," recently published by Zhengzhong Book Company, an expansion of this article? Because I haven't seen it yet, I dare not speculate. Mr. Zhu Guangqian's "Modern Chinese Literature" is slightly brief, but his conclusion is correct. He said: "The import of Western influences has made Chinese literature face a very serious problem, which is tradition. It can be said that our new literature is inheriting Western traditions, while neglecting China's inherent traditions. Mutual influence is a necessary phenomenon of cultural exchange. It is inevitable and natural for Chinese literature to accept Western influences. However, completely abandoning inherent traditions, history will prove that this is not clever..." He also said: "Our new literature is still in its infancy, we are still groping for the way, we must learn humbly, try more broadly, and work more firmly." Mr. Zhu is an authority in the Chinese literary world. His "Poetry Theory" and the articles criticizing Tao Yuanming are all insightful works. What is contained in this short article is also not small. However, we hope that Mr. Zhu can have more narratives and criticisms of current Chinese literature to benefit future generations. Other works by Mr. Zhang Qiyun, Zhang Yinlin, Xie Youwei... are all qualified to be said in the preface of this book. "The purpose is to inspire students' interest in various disciplines, indicate their pathways, and explain their methods." Therefore, I dare to introduce it to high school students and above as extracurricular reading material.

### Rousseau's Educational Thought

— Li Rongru

"Rousseau's Educational Thought" Edited by Teng Dachun, Published by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, Distributed by Commercial Press

Jean-Jacques Rousseau of the eighteenth century was a great and epoch-making thinker. Relying on his keen and profound observations and passionate personality, he bravely raised the banner of resistance against the then French society under the control of traditional civilization. His most powerful masterpieces, "The Social Contract" and "Emile," provided some very novel insights. There is no doubt that the decadent and corrupt society at that time was greatly shaken. From "The Social Contract," we can know Rousseau's political ideals. He said: "Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains." He also said: "Despotic regimes do not rule the people to make them happy; but to impoverish them in order to rule them." From these passionate words, we can see his indignation and hatred for despotic regimes. The French Revolution that followed soon after was clearly inspired by Rousseau's thought. Representing his educational thought is the great work "Emile." In that era, the entire education system and facilities were shrouded in the spirit of obsolete and irrational. The importance of individual development was obliterated by using traditional customs, habits, dogmas, etc. to force and bind individuals, which was all against nature. Genius was shackled, individuality was destroyed, and individuals became slaves of dogma. In response to these malpractices, Rousseau raised his arms and shouted the slogan "Return to Nature," vigorously advocating natural education, attempting to liberate individuals from the shackles of education that harms human nature. The theories and practices of modern new education mostly come from the inspiration of his thought. In Europe and the United States, there are many scholars engaged in the study of Rousseau's works. Although Chinese people have some fragmentary introductions to this, there has indeed been a lack of systematic and rigorous discussions in the past. Today, Mr. Teng Dachun has collected various relevant materials and compiled the book "Rousseau's Educational Thought," objectively commenting on Rousseau's entire educational thought, so that readers can get a glimpse of its outline. I recently read the book again and felt that its content was barely satisfactory. I feel that it is necessary to recommend it to readers.

This book is divided into twelve chapters. The first chapter discusses Rousseau's life, dividing his life into three stages: the stage of capacity accumulation, the stage of writing, and the stage of exile, and describing them in sections. Secondly, there is a detailed description of the personality aspect. The first and second chapters can help readers to understand the clues of his thought more deeply, which is the greatest contribution of this book. The third chapter discusses "Return to Nature," which is the center of Rousseau's thought. What is "nature"? The author of this book has a very profound interpretation of its meaning. The fourth chapter discusses "Natural Man," which can be regarded as Rousseau's ideal educational objective theory. The fifth chapter discusses "development." The concept of development is very important in education. All facilities should be coordinated with the process of children's physical and mental development. Rousseau valued "development" most, which was indeed a novel view in Western Europe at that time. Chapters six, seven, eight, nine, and ten respectively describe the implementation methods of physical education, sensory education, knowledge education, moral education, and religious education, which is his educational method discussion. The eleventh chapter details Rousseau's views on women's education. The last chapter is your criticism of Rousseau's entire educational thought.

What Rousseau is most criticized for by the world is his opinion on women's education; and his extreme contempt for national education and vocational education. The author of this book believes that: "Rousseau was a man of great talent, and the most romantic temperament, too passionate, too sensitive, and happened to be in an old era, and happened to have experienced a sad life. His anger at the world, his complaints, his shouts, his roars, are all reasonable." In order to break through the shackles of old education, it is inevitable that there will be places where he is too extreme in his discussions. But his contribution to modern new education cannot be completely denied, such as: "The creation of the children's welfare movement," "The creation of life education," and "The advocacy of child-centered education." These are all unique insights. He is indeed worthy of being an enlightener of modern times. Mr. Teng, based on his life, personality, and historical background, speaks for Rousseau from his point of view, which is reasonable and can eliminate general misunderstandings. This is a point worthy of attention.

There are three advantages of this book: (1) The writing is fluent. Looking at the description of the text in the book as a whole, there is a sense of flowing water, giving readers a fresh and pleasant impression. (2) The viewpoint is fair and objective, not influenced by traditional prejudices. According to objective and credible information, the book comments on Rousseau's educational thought. (3) The structure is rigorous, the levels are clear, and it has the magic of attracting people. As for its shortcomings, there are naturally also, the main ones are two: (1) At the end of each chapter, there is no related reference book, which is very inconvenient for readers to study further. (2) Regarding the theory of sex education, Rousseau has a very detailed exposition in Emile. The discussion of this aspect in this book is inevitably too brief, which is a fly in the ointment.

Generally speaking, this book is still a book worth reading, this point I can guarantee responsibly.

### Knowing Our Friendly Nation: India—After Reading "Indian Science"

— Yang Shi

The relationship between China and India cannot be compared with the relations with other countries. Cultural exchange and mutual sympathy have made it so that there is no conflict of interest between these two old brothers that are recovering, but rather a fraternal relationship. But regrettably, in terms of the understanding of this great friendly nation, especially regarding her efforts and achievements in scientific construction, we dare to declare that it is extremely insufficient. Therefore, we especially introduce Professor Liu Xian's "Indian Science" (published by Zhengzhong Book Company) to domestic scientific workers. From this systematic book on Indian science, we will not only have a deeper understanding of our old friendly nation, but also, from their century-long experience of exploration, we can find a healthy path that China should follow in engaging in scientific construction.

Professor Liu Cheng introduced Indian science in four topics: (1) Ancient Indian science; (2) Indian science before the twentieth century; (3) Indian science in the twentieth century; (4) Indian scientific publications and experts. Moreover, the author believes that "the British Empire's education policy after annexing India had a great impact on Indian science," so there is also a special review of the British government's education administrative policies after 1757.

Before the twelfth century, the activeness of India in academic thought was very similar to the contention of a hundred schools of thought in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods of China. At this time, they had already made achievements in science, such as the invention of Arabic decimal numerals (not invented by the Arabs), and Bhaskara's brilliant contribution to algebra in 1112. But the revival of Brahmanism suppressed this vitality with one hand; it was not until the annexation of the British Empire in the eighteenth century that Indians were able to freely pursue science again. This is very similar to the domineering style of Confucianism in the Western Han Dynasty of China.

Before the twentieth century, Indians were still learning behind closed doors in science. Once they entered the twentieth century, which Westerners called the "century of awakening of the Orientals," they began to bear brilliant flowers. The expansion and increase of scientific institutions, and the emergence of scientific celebrities are enough to show that their cultivation has begun to bear fruit. Among them, the greatest achievements are mathematics, theoretical physics, electrochemistry, colloid chemistry, astrophysical science, botanical morphology, and paleobotany. The achievements of many outstanding scientists have not only made the world re-evaluate the intelligence and ability of the Indian nation, but also restored their self-confidence. Therefore, among the three most admired Indian saints, the scientist Sir Chandra Bose is one saint; the other two saints are Gandhi and Tagore, who are well known to the world. Sir Bose's greatest achievements are in theoretical physics and botany, such as the Boss-Einstein Statistics, which is his discovery.

The first, and so far the only, Oriental to win the Nobel Prize in Science (the literary prize won by the Indian writer Tagore does not count) is the Indian physicist Dr. Venkata Raman. The most famous "Raman effect" in spectroscopy is his proud discovery. Many Indian scientists became famous at a young age, and most of them were not from the aristocracy, but completely fought their way out of poverty. For example, many of Dr. Raman's papers were written while he was a small clerk in the Indian Ministry of Finance. Srinivasa Ramanujun, the most talented mathematician with the highest attainments in number theory, was not highly educated but was a small doctor's assistant in a trust company, but he persevered in overcoming difficulties, which ultimately gave them the opportunity to exert their wisdom. Compared to China, India's social class, religious influence, language, and the disparity between the rich and the poor are all deadly enemies of the development of science, but they have overcome them; this is somewhat encouraging to Chinese scientific workers who are struggling in hardship today.

The original author believes that the reason why Indian science has the status it has today is not only due to the hard work of Indian scientists, but also because "various societies have played a huge role," so he used a lot of space to introduce the many scientific societies and scientific activities of universities in India today. The colonial policy implemented by the British Empire in India was "curseable," but their assistance to Indians in establishing scientific institutions and greatly expanding university education is worth celebrating. For example, the Indian Science Congress, which was founded in 1911, is attended by the world's leading scientists every year. Its scale and atmosphere are "incommensurate" with the poverty of the Indian people, but the Indian government "does its best to support science" under any circumstances, so they can hold many meaningful scientific activities.

### Reading "A Coward"

— Ji Ping

Just as the translator Li [omitted character] stated: "The greatest feature of this book is the author's realistic approach to the subject matter. These scenes of grappling with real life are simple and clear. It is no accident that Gorky ascended to the highest peak of the world's literary scene with this book; it was no stroke of luck."

Indeed, this world-class literary giant presents us with a vivid portrayal of Russian society under the Tsarist regime. In particular, the protagonist Foma seems to be born, to grow, and even to become a fool before our very eyes, smiling darkly and desolately. His character is so prominent.

From here, from this massive work of six hundred and sixty pages, we clearly see the lives of Russian nobles, merchants, officials, laborers, intellectual workers, women, and prostitutes, all meticulously depicted by the author's powerful pen. Throughout the book flows an unchanging, dense, and melancholic vitality, like sunlight obscured by layers of dark clouds, allowing people to feel intense heat even under a gloomy sky.

In Gorky's works, boundless maturity and power are often hidden. "A Coward" is no exception.

Foma, the son of a wealthy merchant, is described as follows:

"He seemed to be expecting something—as if something obscured his eyes. His deceased mother lived in the same way, groping in the dark."

Foma was indeed groping in the dark, he was indeed expecting something, although even he himself did not understand what he was expecting. Real life relentlessly pushed him, causing him to involuntarily embark on a narrow path that even he could not see clearly. A narrow path leading to destruction.

The author uses the most concise metaphors, writing with sharp precision to convey extremely profound meanings. When Foma wails after his father's death, his godfather, a more greedy and treacherous merchant, says to him lightly and mysteriously:

"You are now the commander-in-chief on the front lines. You should bravely command your soldiers. Your soldiers are rubles. You have many soldiers, you must fight incessantly!"

His father, his aunt, his godfather, Lubov, [omitted character] Ya, these many people, either taught him how to understand life or complained about it.

"What does this all mean?" he wondered. "If people are not life, then what is life? People always talk as if life is something else… This thing hinders people's existence, perhaps it is the devil!" A terrifying feeling rushed towards this young man.

Only the desolation and silence of the streets could answer him.

Thus, like the children of wealthy people in general, he squandered large amounts of time in gambling and drinking.

Everyone, like him, became wildly joyful, all were assaulted by the same black wave, and then carried away like garbage. All these people, like him, were afraid to look ahead, afraid to see clearly where the surging waves would take them. They drowned their terror in wine and meat, rushing forward in the rapid current, struggling, shouting, doing meaningless things, playing the fool, yelling, yelling, but never finding joy.

Foma was unknowingly swept away by the waves in this way. When he saw others laboring hard, he also thought about his own strength. But it was of no use.

Thus, the days were muddled and wasted.

Three years later, he wandered back, "looking exhausted, shabbily dressed, his mind clouded, often drunk, his brow furrowed, his head hanging on his chest, appearing very gloomy."

Yes, Foma himself explained the reason for this:

"…I am finished because of blindness, I see too little, so I have become as blind as an owl—."

Using Foma's life as the warp and the social background of the time as the weft, the author interweaves them to dissect the true lives and inner souls of various people for us.

The author only gives us a mass of un-enlightened fire, a gloomy and mixed picture of the human world, but from this, the reader is enlightened. We gain life lessons from here, and we will therefore choose and create the right path, and step onto the road to truth. Bless those who seek truth. Bless the giants of humanity.

### Perseverance

— Ti Zhai

Although Xunzi's Exhortation to Learning says, "If you carve and give up, rotten wood will not break; if you carve without stopping, metal and stone can be cut," few people truly do this in learning. Therefore, after nearly a century of universities and thousands of middle schools, the number of scholars, calculated by the product of time and space, is still too small. This proves that scholars have failed to persevere and that talent is rare and difficult to find.

But those who truly persevere are not students, but merchants' advertisers. Coca-Cola's splash with fifty billion (equivalent to three thousand U.S. dollars, or ten thousand pre-war national currency) at the National Games is a given. But in my own observations, many very small businessmen have imitated this. Sometimes, even we who distrust advertisements can't help but fall into the trap. I travel to and from Suzhou every week for teaching. There's a fellow selling locks at the Suzhou train station, dressed in a uniform and hat like a train station employee. Thirty minutes before the train departs, he gives a lecture in the train car about common sense for train travel, such as keeping your ticket safe, sending people off early, and distributing tickets when walking together, as well as the weather getting hotter and not throwing cigarette butts randomly. At first, I praised the train station's thoughtful service, listening carefully. Many elderly people nodded and praised it as a rare kindness in a chaotic world. But then things went wrong. He went from touring Tiger Hill and Lingyan to luggage and bags, and then to locks, describing the importance of locks. Then, he took out a handful of small locks, describing their springiness, and promoting them as domestic products, saying they were displayed at a certain company on Nanjing Road—who knows!—but said he wasn't selling them, just introducing them. This created a good smokescreen, reducing people's aversion to fly-by-night businesses. Later, he took out six safety pins, also for introduction. Like this, a sewing needle in a small glass bottle, a copper toothpick, a few scattered items. Finally, he said they were all gifts, and if anyone wanted to buy a lock, he would give them away at half price, and give away these gifts universally, etc. The value gradually increased from about twenty thousand to thirty or forty thousand. At this time, there were still more than ten minutes before departure, and he actually sold two or three dozen. Every week I must respectfully listen to this man's lecture once, and people buy every time. There are so many people in China, and few feel it is repetitive besides me. The effectiveness of advertising may lie in its insistence.

Are the neon lights and radios in big cities not examples of this? Our senses have almost invisibly lost their freedom. The success of things in the world sometimes depends on the needs of the other party, sometimes on the preferences of the other party, which is not surprising. Some are due to the other party's annoyance, which we did not expect. I once saw this point in seeking a job. An old notebook records that a certain official sent a concubine to a powerful minister, naming her after himself. The recipient was inevitably surprised. The gift-giver explained it well: "I hope that the Grand Master will remember the humble official's name whenever he uses her, and the humble official will benefit greatly!" This is the application of advertising to personal affairs. We have to remember their names precisely because we don't want to hear cigarette advertisements or see toothpaste neon lights.

It is said that when trams first appeared in Shanghai, there was an advertisement on the trams: "Everyone can sit." This is an utterly honest advertisement. All honest advertisements are fundamentally unnecessary. So, I have never heard of trams or buses advertising except to announce price increases. Rice shops and salt shops also have no need for this. However, there is sometimes a danger to people's lives when milling rice and oil. This is truly incomprehensible: the more it is needed, the less it is said; the less it is needed, the more it is desperately pushed into our ears! Of all the talents in the world, only Liu Bei goes to invite Zhuge Liang. There is no reason for Zhuge Liang to post a job advertisement. If Liu Bei really didn't know about Zhuge Liang, it is Liu Bei's responsibility and cannot be blamed on Zhuge Liang for not advertising.

Of course, we don't want people to post job advertisements, but we very much hope that rice shops, oil and salt shops, or trams and buses will advertise with big price cuts.

### How to Watch Opera?

— Chen Yixian

What I call watching opera refers to Peking opera. I think: first, don't think that people today are not as good as the ancients. Chen Delin (Lanfang's teacher) singing a few lines is certainly better than Lanfang, but in terms of the entire opera's art, Lanfang is really surpassing his teacher. Among the current old male roles, several famous actors, such as Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying, are certainly not comparable to the former Tan Xinpei. But in terms of female roles, Dr. Mei's current position is really better than before, equivalent to the position that the old Tan had in male roles in the past. He can be called the "King of the Opera World" without objection.

Second, watching opera should look at the inside, not just at the superficial surface. Of the people who watch Dr. Mei's opera in Shanghai, eight or nine out of ten say that Lanfang is old and not as good as before. My view is the opposite. I think now is Lanfang's best time, because he has reached the realm of perfection. For example, in the opera "Royal Stele Pavilion," Meng Yuehua has several running scenes, and several movements with the water sleeves are really extremely beautiful. Lanfang used to be unable to express his inner feelings outwardly when performing, and to depict the characters in the play to the extreme. Most people in Shanghai who watch opera have a fault, they must watch operas like "Drunken Concubine," "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest," and "Farewell My Concubine" when watching Dr. Mei's opera. In fact, operas like "Royal Stele Pavilion" are also excellent! A true famous actor has his own unique and irreplaceable brilliance, no matter what opera he sings.

The above is only in terms of the art of opera, and not to write a biography for Dr. Mei; (Dr. Mei also does not need me to promote him.) Forty years ago, when I was studying in the old capital, I went to Lanfang's house many times, but now I don't know the house number of Mei's house on Masnan Road.

Last year, Du Shoumeng and Xiao Dong's "Searching the Orphan and Saving the Orphan," the lines "Madam, you don't have to be too fierce" were certainly good, but every lift of a leg and every gesture had its measure. These places are enough to see their hard work, their true skills. In the past, the old Tan sang "A Scholar's Tale" ("Beating the Nephew and Visiting the Grave"). The brilliance of the whole opera need not be said. Finally, when he came on stage, his few steps were really unprecedented and unparalleled, beautiful to the extreme. From the dynamics of his back, you could see the joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness of the characters in the play, as if you saw his heart and liver. Art can reach such a level, it is really admirable.

Famous actors have a kind of skill that is easy for people to know. For example, [omitted character] Wu performs "Three Pulls" ("Selling Horses"), the hat wing on the left side moves, and the one on the right side does not move. The one on the right side moves repeatedly, and the one on the left side does not move. Suddenly, the [omitted character]zi on both sides simultaneously makes a circle. This kind of stunt completely depends on the strength of the head, and it takes several years of hard work to achieve it.

In short, singing opera is difficult, and watching [omitted character] is not easy. Dr. Mei's performance at Tianchan this time, it is not easy to buy tickets, and it is full every day. However, those who can truly appreciate his art probably only account for a very small number.

### Pipe Tobacco

— Ji Mo

I am not much of a pipe smoker, but my ability to resist the urge to buy is very weak. Every time I walk past the glass window of a clean and bright tobacco shop, the shiny pipes of various styles displayed inside always attract my attention. In this way, I have continuously bought four pipes and put them in a corner of my writing desk.

After buying the pipes, I naturally had to buy "tobacco." At first, I bought a kind that was packaged in a tin can lined with waxed paper to prevent moisture, called "Half and Half." I usually smoked it once or twice a week, until recently I finished it.

In addition, my "smoking set" also includes a tobacco pouch, iron wire wrapped in flannel for cleaning the pipe, and slow-burning matches.

Generally speaking, smoking pipe tobacco seems to be more economical than smoking cigarettes. A box of pipe tobacco can last at least half a month to ten days. Moreover, when there are guests, there is no need to use pipe tobacco to treat them, which is equivalent to saving on cigarette expenses. However, the price of goods these days is always rising. The black "Model Pi" tobacco, which was previously entrusted by the Materials Supply Bureau to various stores for retail sale, now costs 100,000 yuan a pack.

### Eccentricities of Literary Figures

— Jin Lin

The English novelist Dickens liked to wear jewels.

The American poet and short story writer Allan Poe liked to sleep with his cat.

The American humorist Mark Twain liked to wear white clothes, even in winter.

The French novelist Daudet liked to sleep with his glasses on.

### President's Ancestral Virtue

— Ruo

The President recently went to Dushan, more than forty miles northwest of Yixing County, to pay homage to the tomb of Jiang, Marquis of Hanting Township. This has been reported in the newspapers. Jiang Cheng, the Marquis of Hanting Township, courtesy name Shaoming, his father Heng, assisted Emperor Guangwu in defeating the Chimei and was [omitted character] and died. There were nineteen people, all moved south. The Marquis of Hanting Township and his eighth brother, the Marquis of Yunyang Township, Mo, both lived in the Gehu Lake in Yangxian (now Yixing). The Jiang family of Yixing today are all his descendants. In the Tang Dynasty, the epitaph of Jiang Gong, Marquis of Hanting Township, erected by the descendants of the Jiang family in the fifteenth year of Tianbao, the original stone no longer exists, but the inscription is still in the genealogy, written by Qi Guangyou, the Secretary Shaojian. During the Jin Dynasty, a branch of the descendants of the Marquis of Hanting Township chose to live in Taizhou. During the Five Dynasties, another branch moved from Hezhou to Ningbo, so the Jiang families in Yixing, Taizhou, and Ningbo can all be related. The President cherishes the virtues of his ancestors. Last year, he returned to Fenghua and paid homage to the tomb of Jiang Junming, Grand Master of Gold and Purple Glory of the Song Dynasty. This time, he went to Yixing to pay homage to the tomb of the Marquis of Hanting Township, all of whom are the President's direct ancestors.

### One Dollar Per Word

— Ping Zhai

Recently, a magazine in Shanghai stipulated that the highest payment for articles would be two dou of white rice per thousand words. For a time, the publishing industry seemed to regard this as a special favor to writers, considering it a grand gesture.

However, according to a recent report in the New York Herald Tribune, in the current United States, payment of one U.S. dollar per word is no longer unusual. It is rumored that the royalties paid to the Duke of Windsor and Churchill for their memoirs published in Life magazine were even higher than this, but the exact amount is unknown.

As early as forty years ago, Rudyard Kipling, the British poet laureate famous for his eulogies of imperialism, had already received a dollar per word. At the time, it was indeed considered an anomaly. An American wrote a letter to Kipling saying: "Having heard that you are selling literature at a dollar a word, I am enclosing a dollar and requesting a sample."

Kipling accepted the dollar and sent him a reply, with only one word: "Thanks."

A few days later, the American customer wrote another letter to Kipling, saying: "Your 'Thanks' word sold for a total of two dollars. After deducting postage and letter paper and envelope expenses, the net profit was ninety cents U.S. dollars. This amount should be divided equally between you and me. I am enclosing your share of forty-five cents (in stamps), please receive it."

The King of England plans to tour Australia and India, with his daughter Princess Elizabeth as Regent. This short-term regency is roughly like the "acting" position in the old officialdom. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, having reigned for fifty years, is old and tired of her duties. She plans to appoint her daughter Princess Juliana as Regent after holding a celebration ceremony, and herself retreat to a peaceful life, enjoying her remaining years. This kind of regency is a step towards succession, like the Chinese concept of "internal abdication."

In Chinese history, when emperors traveled, it was called "hunting tour" or "inspection tour." A prince or high official was usually appointed as "keeper" of the capital, but they only took care of the gates and such, without needing to act as Regent. The place where the emperor went was called the "whereabouts," and important personnel followed him to conduct business as usual. The Qing Dynasty emperors held absolute power. Kangxi and Qianlong often left the capital and traveled to various provinces. They approved matters and instructed the provinces or the keepers to handle them, so there was no need for a Regent. However, Dorgon of the early Qing Dynasty served as Regent as the uncle of the young emperor, and Zaifeng of the late Qing Dynasty served as Regent as the father of the young emperor, both because the monarch was still a child. Therefore, whether it was a prince acting as Regent or the empress dowager ruling from behind the curtain, they were the emperor's elders. In the West, monarchs must be of age to ascend the throne. When they are old or sick, there is a regency. Therefore, their Regents are usually the monarch's children, first "Regent" and then "enthroned," which is close to the Chinese practice of passing the throne to the crown prince.

The Chinese "internal abdication," the so-called "public court transfer," is an extraordinary event, often containing unspeakable secrets. For example, Emperor Gaozu of Tang passed the throne to Emperor Taizong because of the Xuanwu Gate Incident. The two princes had already drawn swords against each other. If Shimin did not seize the throne and Li Yuan did not yield, it would not work. Emperor Gaozong of Song passed the throne to Emperor Xiaozong to enjoy the blessings of the Supreme Emperor. Although Xiaozong was not his biological son, he was able to be filial. However, Gaozong's licentiousness and incompetence were insignificant. As for Xiaozong passing the throne to Emperor Guangzong, and Guangzong passing it to Emperor Ningzong, it was bizarre and like children's play. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty passed the throne to Emperor Jiaqing because he was already eighty-five years old and could not endure the daily chores. He established a new monarch to work on his behalf, while he still held the power to control the government. Jiaqing held the empty position and received the real Qi, so once Qianlong died, Jiaqing took power and immediately executed He Shen (Qianlong's favorite minister) to vent his long-standing resentment.

In European history, monarchies have gradually been eliminated. The two world wars eliminated several more. The surviving ones, large like England and small like the Netherlands, each have good royal models. The national level is high, the national foundation is stable, and the organization is proper. The monarch has no absolute power in politics and no hidden dangers in the court. Regency or succession proceeds step by step, so there is no problem.

### Poem on Passing Diaoyutai

— Shi Shufan

The Seven Li Rapids of the Fuchun River is where Yan Ziling lived in seclusion, setting an example of integrity with his fishing rod. After his death, he was buried in his hometown of Yuyao, at Mount Kexing, known locally as Chenshan, where the Stone Tablet of the Three Elders was discovered in the early Republic. It is less than two villages away from my hometown. During the chaos, I asked for weapons to go south and once passed by his tomb. Later, after the defeat, I fled, wandering between southern Anhui and Zhejiang. I passed Diaoyutai eight times, west of where Xie [omitted character] wept bitterly. The ruined terrace amidst the chaos reflected the green mountains. I vented my anger to the long sky between the [omitted character] and the open space, unaware of the wasted words.

One

Green mountains are colorless, water is silent, don't ask how far the road to Jianghu is. Leaning on the lonely awning, I wave painful tears, it's difficult to tell Mr. the past! The grass in the Jimen is green, the soldiers are like mice, the Hu horses' lamps are red, the ghosts fill the city; the characters are empty, the loyalty and righteousness are exhausted, the actors compete for death.

Two

Asked about my family, the calamity is getting deeper, if I can return east and get ten thousand words said! The water and stones at the bow of the boat are still strict, the clothes and hats under the tomb are not Han people. A breath of sword qi remains, the decaying whiskers accumulate like dust on the road, the clouds in the sky are a spiritual mirror, the wind is angry, if the [omitted character] tree does not spring.

Three

The small boat has passed Yan Tan three times, the crazy dream remotely connects to Shunshui, the Han Han is cold [omitted character], the sky is drunk, the swaying remnant candles are like dust; the memorial was originally to seek virtuous officials, the restoration of the soil should eventually judge the villains! Crouching in the bird awning, I make a secret oath, my life is slow, my lungs and liver are true.

Four

The stream has also flowed away, I can't bear to say that Yi's children are going back and forth here! The fugitive comes today, the whiskers are more and more, only removing horse dung to sacrifice to the green mountains.

A fire burns the [omitted character] in the Cangjiang, the bamboo [omitted character] is broken against the copper lute, the desolate terrace weeps after a thousand years, not for the Liu family or the Zhao family.

Sobbing, the poem is already dry, the wind and sand fill the [omitted character] and the setting sun is slanting, it's pitiful that the fishy smell of June remains, not only the dogs and sheep play at the tomb door.

How can a horse's foot understand this life? The frost beach birds have a return journey, two years without a town or family dream, all entrusted to the fourth cry of the sad ape.

Five

Sleeping three nights, I go east again, coming and going you don't scold, if I can distinguish the local accent, the accumulated hatred is more than the mountains. There is no place to hold a rod to hide, break the reed as a sword to grind! Asking the person with gray hair, how is the ancient pain?

Six

Although the Jianghu is [omitted character], the guest is uneasy, the lamp marks of the old year are seen again today, a paddle newly adds children's tears, the clothes reflect the water, the summer is cold. (At that time, my nephew was occupied by the bandits, and my wife and children fled to Zeguo.)

Is Tongjiang Chenshan Ferry? Every time I ride the tide, I suspect it's a dream. On the stage, the fisherman laughs, for three years I settled in the bird awning.

Seven

Swallowing fish by the water, half of my teeth are gone, I dimly remember passing the beach seven times, the tears of Dongtai Huangzhu and Xitai, it's difficult to make up for it now.

The spirit strikes the silk, the tripod still remains, the Hu sand has accumulated on the sea for a long time, Mount Kexing and the land in front of me, the water is blue and the clouds are barren, each in autumn.

Eight

It's difficult to express a word even if I cut my stomach open, I've come to worship and will rest in death, there is no need to remember the years in the lonely awning, I secretly rejoice if Mr. nods.

The secret oath is clear in the water, the children in front of the terrace understand the deep feeling, the new frost on the return path is gradually white, the clouds make a sheepskin coat to give to the far traveler.
