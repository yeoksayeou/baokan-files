### Annihilation War Waged Between the Huai and Fei Rivers; National Army Continues to Advance; Twenty Communist Columns Encircled

[Our Correspondent, Bengbu, 7th] The Huai-Su Campaign is about to undergo a major development. The National Army, advancing northwest along the Huai and Fei Rivers in a pincer movement, continued its progress today. The stubbornly resisting remnants of the 6th, 13th, and 2nd Communist Columns have found it difficult to withstand the overwhelming pressure of the National Army’s crack troops. At present, a certain unit of the National Army's right pincer has extended to the vicinity of Guzhen. According to intelligence received a few days ago, the main force of the Communist bandits had long left the area. It is widely rumored this afternoon that it has already been recovered, but the military has not confirmed it, only stating that it may be captured tonight. (Note: A Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th claimed that the National Army had entered Guzhen, which was likely a rumor.) Huang Wei's Corps, under the cover of a strong air force, is now launching an attack on the southeast side of the enemy's position and has achieved considerable success. According to officials from the front lines, the distance between Huang Wei's Corps and the vanguard of the northwest-pursuing troops is extremely close. Furthermore, the westward-advancing troops are still engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist bandits on the north bank of the Huai River near Linhuanji.

[Our News Agency] New York, 7th (Broadcast from Nanjing): According to government sources, the Communist army launched a fierce offensive against the National Army southwest of Suxian in order to break through the National Army's interception line. The report also stated that the Second Army Corps of the National Army, with 100,000 men, has deployed its forces in Yongcheng and Wuxian, preparing to launch a large-scale annihilation war against the Communist army. The report further stated that twelve Communist columns, approximately 108,000 men, are attempting to break through the National Army's defense line. It is claimed that additional National Army forces are reinforcing the National Army's defense line.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Military News: The annihilation war against the bandits in the Huai River basin continued from the evening of the 6th to the 7th in the southwestern Suxian area. Chen Yi’s 7th Column attempted to reinforce from Suxian. Liu Bocheng's troops in the Shuangduiji area were severely attacked by our forces, suffering over 2,000 casualties and retreating in defeat. Along the Jinpu Railway, the National Army, moving north, after defeating the remnants of Chen Yi's 2nd Column on both sides of Baojiaji and Songjiawei on the 6th, continued its northward advance. The right-wing corps of the National Army, advancing southward toward Xuzhou, is now engaged in a mopping-up operation to capture the remnants of the Communist bandits who fled to eastern Henan. On the 6th, they intercepted the main force of Chen Yi's bandits from Lisi, Xiangshanmiao, and Mengji (all east of Yongcheng), killing over 5,000 Communist soldiers. The remnants of Chen Yi's bandit forces east of Yongcheng are exhausted, and the National Army is concentrating on annihilating them.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Military News: The war in the Huai and Fei River basins in northern Anhui, up to the border area between Henan and Anhui, is becoming increasingly favorable to the National Army, which is confident of victory. The three major army corps of the National Army, under the command of General Du Yuming, joined forces with the two major army corps moving north across the Fei River, forming a pincer encirclement outside Suxian and Guzhen. They launched a combined attack on the twenty columns of Communist bandit forces under Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng in the area. As of the 7th, the National Army, with Huang Wei's Corps as its core, firmly defended Shuangduiji, closely drawing in nine columns of Liu Bocheng's bandit forces (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, and 10th) and Chen Geng's bandit forces (4th and 9th) around it. After days of joint army-air force attacks, the Communist forces suffered extremely heavy casualties. Chen Yi's bandit forces (2nd, 4th, 9th, 12th, 16th, Liangguang, and Bohai) totaling seven columns, with Suxian as their center, protected the northern flank of Chen Geng and Liu Bocheng's bandit forces and attempted to prevent the National Army from advancing southward from the northwest to attack the Shuangduiji periphery. Chen Yi's bandit forces (2nd, 6th, 11th, and 13th) totaling four columns, with the area north of Guzhen as their center, protected Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's bandit forces from attacking the southeast of Shuangduiji. The National Army, moving south and north, had completed the encirclement of the three units of Chen, Liu, and Chen from the northwest and southeast on the outer line. The three bandit units repeatedly charged east and west without success. Our Huang Wei's Corps in Shuangduiji, under the cover of the air force, is tightening its grip on Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's bandit forces. The National Army's encirclement is shrinking daily. The twenty columns of bandits in this area are weakening daily under the National Army's siege.

[Our Correspondent, Tangshan, 7th] The National Army along the Beining Line (east of Tangshan) launched a mopping-up operation on the 7th. According to the military, the Communist bandits' 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Regiments of the Eastern Hebei Police Force, totaling nearly 10,000 men, sneaked into Dashifo Village, about seven or eight li southwest of Guye, on the evening of the 6th.

[Our News Agency] New York, 7th (Broadcast from Nanjing): The first batch of military supplies under the US$125 million American aid program to China has begun to arrive in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao.

[Associated Press, Los Angeles, 6th] Yang, head of the Chinese military purchasing mission in the United States, arrived here today from Washington on his way back to China. It is said that American aid materials will begin shipping from various ports on the Pacific coast within a month and a half.

### United States Will Use All Its Strength to Protect Interests in Shanghai; US Marines in Qingdao Can Land in Shanghai at Any Time

[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to sources close to the State Department on the 6th, if the Chinese Communists occupy Shanghai, the United States will use all its strength to protect American commercial interests. However, the source made it clear that the State Department has not made any guarantees, and American businessmen who remain in the area do so at their own risk. According to various indications, US consular officials have received instructions to protect American interests with all their strength in case of emergency. The source pointed out that US consular officials in Shanghai will continue their duties, just as the US consulate remained in Shenyang when the Communists entered. They stated that the United States has publicly announced that the US consulate will continue to operate and will provide possible assistance to American citizens, but at present, firm and rapid regulations cannot be announced. Well-informed sources pointed out that when American citizens who are "non-essential" receive advice to withdraw from China, it is up to the American citizens themselves to determine who are "essential" and "non-essential." Those who are deemed "essential" may be allowed to remain, which can be interpreted as US consular officials will fully protect them and their interests.

[United Press, New York, 6th] The American commercial firm controlling the Shanghai Power Company revealed on the 6th that the company had requested the US government to use US Marines to protect its factories in Shanghai. An official of the Electric Bond and Share Company told United Press on the 6th that this request was made several days ago, but we cannot guarantee that our request will be granted or whether it is possible to grant it. The company's statement came three days after representatives of more than 30 American commercial firms with large businesses in China held a meeting in New York to discuss US policy toward China. According to well-informed sources, a representative of the State Department was also present, including Walter Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the department. Mr. Butterworth came to New York from Washington to explain the meaning of the State Department's warning to American businessmen to withdraw their families and staff and to make general preparations for the possibility of the Communists occupying Shanghai.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 6th] Some British and American merchants in Tianjin said today that they are willing to stay here even if the situation deteriorates, but if the Communist army mistreats foreigners or prohibits their trade, foreign merchants will have no choice but to withdraw in the end. According to a representative of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the agency intends to remain in Tianjin to continue relief work, but may change its plan if it receives orders from Washington.

[Our Correspondent, Qingdao, 7th] US Marines can be sent from here to land in Shanghai at any time to protect overseas Chinese. This has been confirmed by well-informed sources. The 3,000 Marines originally stationed in Qingdao are still stationed in their original barracks, while the 1,300 who recently arrived in Qingdao from Guam are still waiting on ships for orders. Previously, dozens of soldiers had been sent to Beijing and Tianjin to protect overseas Chinese. If military developments reach a certain level, the US military will take the above-mentioned action.

### Song Ziwen Indicted for Privately Purchasing Airplanes and Building Airfields; Supervisory Yuan Lacks Full Text of the Indictment Case

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie, Deng Jingfu, Guo Zhongwei, etc., proposed at the end of last month to indict Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, for privately purchasing airplanes and ordering all counties in Guangdong to build airfield runways. The proposal was subsequently established after review by Supervisory Committee members Zhang Dinghua, Li Zheng’e, Cao Haosen, etc., and has recently been submitted to the Executive Yuan. The Supervisory Yuan today released the original text of the indictment case as follows: Song Ziwen, Director of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters and Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to facilitate his inspection of the territory under his jurisdiction and to detect bandits, suppress smuggling, and transmit orders, issued an order on July 18th of this year in his capacity as Chairman of the Provincial Government, instructing all subordinate counties to rush to build airfield runways on a deadline. In August of the same year, he used foreign exchange to privately purchase six small civilian airplanes from the United States, which were transported to Guangdong for use. At that time, the public was resentful and public opinion condemned him, but he disregarded it and insisted on going his own way, which shows his arrogance and arbitrariness. The purchase and use of airplanes and the construction of airfields should fall within the jurisdiction of the central government and should be handled in a unified manner by the central government after considering the actual situation and needs. Local leaders have no right to act on their own, as expressly stipulated in Article 107 of the Constitution. Song Ziwen, as the acting chairman, privately purchased airplanes and built airfield runways without first reporting to the central government for approval or subsequently submitting them to the competent authorities for approval. This constitutes a violation of the law and exceeds his authority, which is a disruption of the military and political system and an encroachment on the powers of the central government. As for the construction of airfields everywhere, the intention of which is to facilitate inspections, it is not appropriate in light of reason and sentiment. As a local leader, when inspecting the territory under his jurisdiction, he should go deep into the countryside, get close to the people, and diligently seek out their grievances. Even if he cannot travel incognito, he should travel light and simply to avoid disturbing the people. However, the acting chairman ordered all counties to build airfield runways and used airplanes to survey from the air, which is contrary to the original intention of inspecting the localities and seeking governance. Even if it is said that it is used for detecting bandits and suppressing smuggling, bandits and smugglers often lurk among the people and move around unpredictably. In order to detect, suppress, and defend against them, the focus should be on strengthening the organization and training of the masses, enriching the local self-defense forces, and fully developing water and land transportation, wired and wireless communications, etc., which is a fundamental plan. Furthermore, from the perspective of strategic relations such as bandit suppression and defense deployment, even if it is recognized that it is necessary to use airplanes for assistance, airfields should only be built at necessary locations or transportation areas within the province, and they should be coordinated with military defense and suppression efforts. How can the order be issued to build airfields everywhere in all counties of the province? This not only lacks military significance and effect, but also wastes manpower, financial resources, and materials, increasing the people's difficulties and providing an excuse for bandits to instigate the people. Furthermore, the small airplanes purchased are all PA-11 Pipercub models, each of which can only accommodate two people and are intended for civilian air travel, not military products. It is obvious that they lack military equipment, and high-altitude flight does not aid in reconnaissance. In addition, the airfield runways ordered to be built are all built to the same level of hardness as highways, and the required length, width, and area are mostly land that the people can cultivate, resulting in widespread losses and a great waste of land, manpower, and materials. Other expenses, such as the preparation of construction materials and the allocation of management personnel, require huge sums of money and cannot be counted. At a time when the country's finances are difficult and the people's livelihood is precarious, all measures that are not important or necessary should embody the difficulties of the times and practice diligence and thrift to save the people's manpower and financial resources and maintain the country's finances. Song Ziwen, as a senior government official, should understand the country's difficulties and the people's suffering, diligently seek governance, and benefit the localities, but instead, he has violated the law and exceeded his authority and failed in his duties. Therefore, a special proposal is made to indict him and request the Executive Yuan to deal with him strictly in accordance with the law and to stop him in order to maintain the national law and relieve the people's difficulties.

### Sun Ke May Be Discharged from Hospital This Weekend; New Cabinet to Be Announced Next Week

[Our News Agency] The stitches on President Sun's left leg wound were completely removed yesterday, and the recovery is going well.

The meeting was convened by Committee member and Minister of Finance Xu Kan. The chairman of the committee was originally scheduled to be concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan, but because President Sun Ke had not yet taken office, it was temporarily held by Minister of Finance Xu Kan. The meeting discussed in detail issues such as coordinating American aid, regulating supplies, and stabilizing the financial economy. It was generally advocated that the government's decision to withdraw gold, silver, and foreign exchange equivalent to US$100 million to purchase domestic and foreign supplies should be handled as soon as possible to absorb idle funds, stabilize the economy and finance, and solve the difficulty of the lack of supplies.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 7th] The Executive Yuan Economic Coordination Committee was formally established on the 7th and began to operate. The original internal appointment for Secretary-General of the Committee was Lin Weiying, but because Lin expressed humility and declined, it was decided to change it to be concurrently held by Vice Minister of Finance Shen Yuanding.

### Jiangyan Garrison Runs Out of Ammunition; All Sacrificed Heroically

[Our Correspondent, Taixian, 7th] The Jiangyan garrison, after struggling for two days and nights, finally ran out of ammunition at noon on the 6th and all sacrificed heroically. It is reported that the attacking bandits totaled more than 20,000, personally commanded by bandit leader Huang Yifeng, with more than 40 cannons of various calibers and more than 200 light and heavy machine guns. They bombarded with artillery at night and launched human-wave attacks on the strongholds during the day. The defending troops fought bravely, advancing one after another until noon on the 6th, when all the fortifications of the strongholds were destroyed, and they were cut off from reinforcements and ran out of ammunition, so the bandits broke in.

Editorial

### Save Ourselves! Save the Nation! Save the World!

Today is the anniversary of the day, seven years ago, when Japanese militarists launched the Pacific War, the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. From that day on, the two major nations on both sides of the Pacific, China and the United States, truly stood on the same battle line, jointly fighting against the invading Japan. With the joint operations of China and the United States, as well as other democratic countries, persisting for as long as three and a half years—China fought even more arduously for as long as eight years—the three Axis aggressor nations were finally defeated. Looking back now, it is truly filled with countless emotions!

Madame Chiang Kai-shek flew to Washington to appeal to the American government and the public to strengthen aid to China. It is said that she will issue her first public declaration today, asking China's friends to learn from history how to save civilization. We also wish to take advantage of this meaningful historical anniversary to explain to the people of China and the United States, and even to the people of all democratic countries: Any anti-communist war in any corner of the world is a war in which everyone has a part to play. Saving oneself, saving the nation, is also saving the world. China's war to contain the communist armed rebellion is certainly no exception—especially the American people should not be indifferent, like watching a fire from across the river!

First, let's talk about saving ourselves: For the Chinese people, of course, we should realize that suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion is entirely to save each and every one of us. The great unity action of the Shanghai industrial community on the 5th has fully demonstrated that hundreds of thousands of workers in Shanghai have a clear understanding. I believe that one day the five million citizens of Shanghai will roar. Even those who are rushing to escape, how can they not know that if the communist bandits truly win and implement their brutal rule, no peace-loving citizen can survive. Families will be broken, brothers will fight each other, young men will be turned into cannon fodder in the "human wave tactics," and women will become food rations for the bandits. The nation of civilized clothing and artifacts can suddenly become a den of male thieves and female prostitutes. If we do not rise up to save ourselves and instead focus on escaping, then when the communist bandits sweep in and take everything away, the civilization passed down for thousands of years and the freedom enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people will inevitably be completely wiped out! Even from the perspective of the American people and the people of all democratic and free countries, they all have expatriates and property and businesses in China. How can they simply "abandon" them and fully protect what they have worked hard to build for a hundred years? What's more, the friendly trade relations between China and foreign countries, the "priceless treasure" cultivated over a hundred years, cannot be completely sacrificed by allowing the communist bandits to run rampant. Therefore, it is the sole task to save themselves for the United States and even all democratic countries to quickly conclude a joint defense treaty in the Far East and in China, in order to curb the communist bandits in China and eliminate the communist bandits in China.

Next, let's talk about saving the nation and saving the world... The communist parties of all countries in the world are a whole. The Chinese Communist Party is of course under the command of the Communist International, with the ultimate goal of destroying China and becoming a Soviet appendage. Therefore, the day the Chinese communist bandits succeed will be the day the Republic of China perishes! The Chinese people, in order to cherish the democratic republic, must rise up in time to save this precarious Republic. We love democracy and oppose totalitarianism; we love freedom and oppose autocracy. We must use our power to save ourselves to save the nation; and we must use our enthusiasm to save the nation to save ourselves. Many people only know how to look forward to "U.S. aid" every day. In fact, U.S. aid will be strengthened sooner or later, but the most important thing is to first help ourselves to save the country. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, used Korea as a metaphor in his posthumous work "The Question of China's Survival." He said, "Korea hates Japan's annexation even more, especially because the United States started [to help], but sat idly by in the middle. As the ancients said, 'Those who go up to the hundred-foot building will remove the ladder.' The situation of the United States in Korea is like this... However, how can this be blamed on the United States? Korea's demise was caused by relying on what could not be relied on, and it is not the fault of the United States... Today, China is about to become Korea again, and the United States will once again be accused of 'sitting idly by and not helping.' When things have passed, we will regret that we did not plan well from the beginning, but it will be too late!" Today, when we read these words, we feel a chill down our spines! Of course, we have our legitimate reasons for demanding increased U.S. aid today, but the most important thing is that we must first mobilize the power of the people themselves and save our own country first. Do not blame the United States for "sitting idly by and not helping." Secondly, we want to advise our American friends that your aid to China is no different from saving your own country and saving mankind in the world; because if China is indeed controlled by the CCP, the claws of Soviet Union, due to the weakness of the anti-communist forces, then China is in the iron curtain. The Far East will soon be shrouded in the iron curtain. How can Western Europe be able to remain unscathed? The United States may not be able to rest easy! The communist party's dream of world revolution may begin with the conquest of China. Therefore, from the standpoint of the Chinese people, we should raise our awareness and always have the vigilance that "the United States may not be reliable, and it is not necessary to rely on it," and strive ourselves, work hard, and use our iron shoulders to uphold the righteousness of the world; and from the standpoint of the American people, for the sake of right and wrong in the world, and for the sake of their own interests, the United States has the moral responsibility to strengthen aid to China, and only the United States has the military and economic power to strengthen aid to China.

Today is the seventh anniversary of the Pearl Harbor incident. The Chinese people are now standing on the front line of the world's anti-communist, anti-totalitarian, and anti-aggression struggle! I hereby inform American friends and friends from all democratic countries that if they hesitate and do not strengthen aid to China today, there will inevitably be a second Pearl Harbor and Singapore will be attacked!

Then, the discussion matters were carried out: (1) The Labor and Social Committees reported the review of the proposal by Yuan Qihui, An Futing, and others to amend the relevant provisions of the Trade Union Law in order to meet the actual needs of workers.

(3) The Finance Committee reported the review and amendment of Article 5 of the Business License Tax Law. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed. (The amended article is published on the fourth page). (4) The Finance and Commercial Law Committees reported the review and amendment of Article 14 of the Business License Tax Law and Article 10 of the Feast and Entertainment Tax Law.

It was resolved to pass it as reviewed. (The amended articles are on the left corner) (6) The National Defense and Legal System Committees reported the consolidated review of the draft Regulations on Military Compensation.

(7) The National Defense and Legal System Committees reported the review of the draft amendment to the Organization Regulations of the Provincial Security Command.

(9) The Finance, Agriculture and Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committees reported the review of the proposal by Xie E et al. to amend the items related to chemical artificial fertilizers in the Customs Import Tariff to reduce the burden on the people and encourage increased production. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, and the tax rates for various chemical artificial fertilizers were greatly reduced (detailed in another telegram). (10) The Legal System Committee reported the review of the proposal by Jiang Yiping et al. to revise Article 30 of the Lawyers Law. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, canceling the restriction that lawyers could not serve as speakers or deputy speakers of public opinion organs, and amending the article to "Lawyers shall not hold concurrent public office, but this shall not apply to those who hold specific temporary positions in central or local agencies." (11) The Agriculture and Forestry and Water Conservancy Committees reported the temporary suspension of the application of the proviso of Article 12 of the Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Regulations. It was resolved to pass it as is. (12) The Grain Administration and Finance Committees reported the re-examination of the proposal by Qu Zhisheng et al. to establish a grain storage system to regulate grain supply and demand in order to lay the foundation for grain administration. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, but due to the current period of turmoil and the country's financial difficulties, the construction of warehouses and the accumulation of grain are beyond the country's ability, so the original proposal was temporarily reserved. (13) The Finance Committee reported the review of the temporary emergency motion by Huang Shaohong et al. to change the Executive Yuan's current policy and implement the lifting of the gold ban. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, because the Executive Yuan's current policy referred to in the proposal was the policy before the promulgation of the amended regulations on the issuance of gold yuan and the amended regulations on the handling of people's gold, silver, and foreign currency. The current policy framework has already been changed, and gold and silver have been unbanned, so the original proposal has lost its effect and was reserved.

(15) Mu Chao et al. proposed to request the government to launch a nationwide spiritual mobilization to strengthen bandit suppression, reform politics, and complete national construction. Some members believed that spiritual mobilization was a social movement that could be implemented directly without the need for the Legislative Yuan to enact a law, so it was decided to reserve it. As for proposal (16) by Qi Zhihou et al. to request the government to accuse the Soviet Union to the United Nations of assisting the Chinese Communists in invading Northeast China and threatening world peace, due to insufficient time, it was not discussed and it was decided to leave it for the next meeting. At the end of the meeting, the temporary motion by Li Shijun, Wu Wangqi, and others was passed, submitting written inquiries to the government on the issue of personnel appointments after the appointment of President Yu of the Central Bank and the recent unauthorized continuous price increases in state-owned transportation enterprises, which stimulated prices and disrupted people's hearts.

### Terror and Violence Threaten the World; US Calls for International Unity; Dulles Emphasizes Resolution to Support Korean Independence

[United Press, Paris, 7th] U.S. representative Dulles, during the UN Political Committee's debate on the Korean issue, called on the world to guard against the intimidation and violence of the communists. He accused the Soviet Union of supporting the terroristic acts of the Korean communists in defiance of the United Nations' mandate. Dulles claimed that only unprecedented unity among nations outside the Iron Curtain to prevent communist atrocities and threats can create the best opportunity for peace. He stated: "We see everywhere violence, terror, and strife caused by external factors, with the instigators seeking to achieve international goals through this. Every non-communist country in the world is to some extent under this attack. There is only one basic defense method for them: through the United Nations, and moral solidarity with countries threatened and suppressed by communism. The United Nations has a great responsibility. Whenever such intimidation and threats occur internationally, the United Nations should actively indicate that the world will use all peaceful means, either through the United Nations or through member states complying with the Charter, so that conspiracies cannot succeed." To date, Dulles' remarks today are the most radical among U.S. representatives in directly organizing an anti-communist group. While explaining the U.S. proposal on the Korean issue, Dulles presented a plan to end the conflict. He suggested that the United Nations immediately send an inspection team to observe the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops. Dulles requested the United Nations to recognize the U.S.-backed government in Korea and disregard the communist government in North Korea. Dulles stated, "I hope this case will receive the support of an overwhelming majority. If the non-communist countries of the world can unite to oppose the communist strategy, then those who rely solely on military coercion, terror, and violence to achieve a certain international political goal will know that it is difficult to succeed. The greatest hope for peace lies in this." Dulles hinted that the North Korean government may soon receive assistance from the communists in Northeast China and stressed that the United Nations must not disregard the seriousness of the Korean issue. 社氏 claimed that the occupying forces in Korea must withdraw completely as soon as possible, so that the Korean people can truly govern themselves without being ruled or threatened by those relying on external forces.

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] With only five days remaining in the UN General Assembly session, the debate on the Korean issue has just begun, and the Soviet Union has informally indicated that it will do everything possible to prevent the UN General Assembly from taking any action on the Korean issue.

### US, Australia, and China Propose to the United Nations; Recognize South Korean Government; Advocate Withdrawal of Occupying Forces Under UN Supervision

[United Press, Paris, 6th] The United States today suggested that U.S. and Soviet occupying forces withdraw from Korea at the "earliest possible" time under the observation of a special UN committee. This suggestion was put forward in the form of a motion during the Political Committee's debate on the Korean issue (co-signed by China and Australia). The motion also requested the United Nations to recognize the U.S.-backed South Korean government as the sole legitimate government of Korea. This move is likely to reject the Soviet Union's claim that the North Korean communist government represents the Korean people. The Soviet Union condemned the U.S. for establishing a "police state" in the U.S.-occupied area of South Korea.

When the Political Committee began debating the Korean issue, Soviet representative Malik stated that the South Korean police were "persecuting South Korean democratic leaders in a big way." He stated, "South Korea is a police state, with the police controlled by the U.S. occupying forces. At the same time, 53 percent of the police officers above the rank of lieutenant are officers who previously collaborated with the Japanese." Malik accused the UN-supervised elections in South Korea of being illegal, just like the public opinion polls conducted by Hitler. The Political Committee voted 34 to 6 against inviting representatives of the North Korean communist government to attend and testify, but voted 39 to 6 to hear the testimony of representatives of the South Korean government. Although the Soviet Union has declared the withdrawal of the North Korean occupying forces, the U.S. occupying forces will continue to remain until South Korea has established sufficient national defense forces. The U.S. believes that if the U.S. military withdraws at this time, the Soviet-trained North Korean army will sweep across the entire Korean Peninsula. Therefore, the phrase "as soon as possible" in the U.S. proposal does not mean an immediate withdrawal of troops. At the same time, the U.S. requests that the new Korean Committee be authorized to inspect all of Korea. The Soviet Union has refused to allow the former UN committee to enter North Korea and conducted elections without UN supervision, forming the North Korean communist government. The U.S. proposal is based on the fact that the South Korean government was formed after elections conducted under UN supervision and should therefore be recognized as the legitimate government.

### Appeal Cases of Hiranuma and Other Seven Japanese War Criminals to be Heard by the US Supreme Court Mid-Month; Chinese and British Delegations to Japan Express Deep Surprise

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The U.S. Supreme Court decided today by a vote of five to four to accept the appeals of two Japanese war criminals sentenced to hanging, Doihara and Hiranuma, and five war criminals sentenced to imprisonment, Kido Koichi, Oka Takasumi, Sato Kenryo, Shimada Shigetaro, and Togo Shigenori, and ordered them to be escorted to the U.S. for trial. Judge Jackson stated that he and Judges Byrnes, Douglas, Murphy, and Rutledge voted in favor of accepting the appeals, while Chief Justice Vinson and Judges Reed, Frankfurter, and Burton opposed.

Jackson explained his personal reasons for voting in favor of accepting the appeals, stating that because the number of justices for and against accepting the appeals was equal (i.e., four to four), if he did not participate in the vote, it would be difficult to explain to the people of the world, especially the people of the East. The U.S. has a great responsibility for capturing these Japanese prisoners, and therefore has a responsibility for their fate. If these appeals are deadlocked in the Supreme Court, the authorities will have no choice but to carry out the sentences, which will cause the world to doubt the fairness of the U.S. judiciary. This is an irreparable loss. On the contrary, accepting the appeals maintains the dignity of the U.S. judiciary and can gain the understanding of our allies without being accused of encroaching on the jurisdiction of international tribunals. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing on the 16th of this month.

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] The Chinese and British delegations to Japan expressed surprise on the 7th at the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to accept the appeals of two high-ranking Japanese war criminals. Shawn, representative of the British Commonwealth Allied Council, declared that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision was a surprising action that undermined the prestige of the Allied military tribunal and was a blow to the "legal status" of the Allied military tribunal. Shawn stated, "This seems to partially acknowledge the claim that the Far East Military Tribunal is not an international tribunal but was established by the President of the United States. We believe that the power of the Far East Military Tribunal comes from the Far Eastern Commission. If the U.S. Supreme Court continues to act, this new claim will damage the legal status of the Far East Military Tribunal's verdict in international law." General Shang Zhen, spokesperson for the Chinese representative to the Allied Council, also similarly declared that he was deeply surprised by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. The spokesperson for the Soviet delegation stated that General Travyanko, the Soviet representative to the Allied Council, was busy today and could not comment on the matter. MacArthur himself had no immediate reaction. According to senior officials close to MacArthur, the executions by hanging of the seven high-ranking war criminals who had been sentenced to death would be postponed until the U.S. Supreme Court took action on the appeals of Doihara and Hirota. On the morning of the 7th, the news that the U.S. Supreme Court had decided to accept the appeals spread throughout Tokyo. The Japanese Kyodo News Agency reported that the Supreme Court's ruling came like shrapnel in the morning of the 7th, causing great emotional upheaval. Japanese legal circles were eager to know the legal basis of this decision. Both Japanese and Allied personnel here expressed surprise at the Supreme Court's decision to accept the appeals. Allied General Headquarters Press Officer Ages stated "no comment" in the morning and has not issued any statement since.

### General Assembly Scheduled to Conclude on Saturday After Three Months of Meetings Without Major Accomplishments; to Reconvene in New York in April

The vote took place after representatives ridiculed themselves and other delegations for failing to complete their work in three and a half months. With a third of the General Assembly's agenda items yet to be raised, representatives took to the rostrum in the Palais de Chaillot one after another to criticize the current session for "too much talk, too little action." Soviet representative Vyshinsky also participated in this universal self-criticism, stating, "There is an endless motion here... This is by no means the way to solve problems." It is estimated that the current session of the General Assembly will cost approximately $356,000. British Secretary of State McNeil predicted that the next session would last even longer. Because Britain urgently needed to resolve the issue of former Italian colonies, it strongly advocated postponing the session after Christmas or closing it only after the work was completed. The General Assembly rejected the Soviet Union's desire to postpone all agenda items until the regular session in September next year.

### Experts Survey the Jiang Ya Steamer: Determine It Was Not a Boiler Explosion; Whether the Explosive Was Internal or External Remains to Be Investigated

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to thoroughly understand the cause of the "Jiang Ya" steamer disaster, yesterday specially invited experts from the shipping industry in this city and news reporters, dispatching a special boat No. 309 (民字三〇九號) to go to the scene of the accident for detailed investigation. The experts invited to attend included Gu Jiukuan, Deputy General Manager of China Tanker Company; Lu Liangbing, Chairman of the Association of Marine Engineers; Yang Junsheng, Chairman of the Chinese Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers; Zhu Tianbing, Chief Engineer of China Tanker Company; Ye Zaifu, Head of the Department of Naval Architecture at Jiaotong University; Chai Zhiming, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Jiaotong University; Hong Ruitao, the newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau; American maritime experts Gorham, Baus; Jiang Keni, Secretary-General of the Merchant Marine Federation; Lin Guoyong and Song Jinlin, technicians from the Maritime Affairs Bureau; Captain Zhou Qixin, and thirteen others. Huang Muzong, Manager of the Shipping Department of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Xin Yixin, Chief Engineer; Zhang Lingfa, Chief Marine Engineer; Fan Lun, Director of the Maritime Affairs Section; Shen Dacai, Captain of the Jiang Ya steamer; and Hu Caiyang, Chief Marine Engineer, also accompanied them. The special boat set sail at 10:30 AM and arrived at 1:10 PM. There, the "Guotai" barge, which was carrying out salvage work, transferred all personnel to the exposed part of the Jiang Ya steamer for inspection. Although the Jiang Ya steamer had sunk, the entire top of the bridge was still visible above the water. The bow faced south-southeast, and the ship's hull was not tilted. The smokestack and the surrounding vents had not collapsed. About 90 feet from the smokestack, there was extremely thick angle iron sticking up on the starboard side of the stern, and pieces of wooden planks were constantly floating out from there. According to experts, this was indeed where the explosion originated. The electrical wires and tow ropes between the fore and aft masts on the ship's deck were all broken, and the fore and aft masts were slightly tilted, indicating that the explosion was extremely powerful at the time of the incident.

Captain Recounts the Circumstances of the Accident

According to Shen Dacai, the Captain of the "Jiang Ya" who accompanied the group, the equipment on the "Jiang Ya" was much better than other merchant ships. There were dedicated personnel on duty every day to watch over the boiler pressure. On the day of the accident, the ship was traveling at a very low speed. Based on the fact that the pressure did not exceed the limit, it can be inferred that the boiler would not have exploded. After inspecting the actual situation of the smokestack not collapsing, the experts also believed that the cause of the Jiang Ya steamer disaster was definitely not due to a boiler explosion. Subsequently, according to Shen’s recollection of the circumstances at the time of the accident: when the explosion sound occurred at the stern of the ship, he was in the captain's cabin at the bow, preparing to go to bed. He only heard a loud noise, like thunder. He immediately stumbled out of the room from the bedside. After getting up, the lights were already out, and the radio was completely destroyed. Within two or three minutes, the ship completely sank, so he judged that the explosive had a very high explosive force, but the sound of the explosion did not sound like a torpedo.

Unable to Submerge Due to High Tide

The experts on the special boat originally planned to send divers into the water to investigate whether the edges of the explosion site were rolled inward or outward in order to determine whether the explosive was external or internal. However, due to the high tide, the danger was high, and the divers could not work. Therefore, the special boat first returned to Shanghai. All the experts then released a joint report on the boat, which stated:

"We arrived at the scene of the "Jiang Ya" steamer disaster at about 1:00 PM on the 7th to inspect it. At that time, it was high tide. We saw the entire top of the bridge of the "Jiang Ya" exposed about five feet above the water. The smokestack and the surrounding vents, deck planks, davits, freshwater tanks, safety buckets, etc. were also exposed and could be seen clearly. They were all intact and showed no signs of damage. The aft mast was slightly tilted backward, and close to the right front of the aft mast, there were several pieces of angle iron sticking up in a complex manner. This area appeared to be the roof beams of the second mate's cabin and the radio operator's room, which were damaged by the explosion. Based on the above observations, it can be determined that it was definitely not a boiler explosion. It is speculated that the location of the explosion was in the rear part of the third cargo hold on the starboard side, about 90 feet from the smokestack (the boiler is directly below the smokestack). As for whether the explosive was internal or external, it will be necessary to wait for the divers to explore the situation of the damage before a conclusion can be drawn."

### East Wu University Student Accusation Case: Plaintiff and Defendant Appear in Court, Each Holding Their Own Words; The Court Orders Summons of Witnesses and Reschedules the Trial

[Our Newspaper News] Zhen Yanqing, a student at the Law School of Soochow University, sued his classmate Zhou Gan and Wu Xisheng for assault. Judge Zhang Yuanzhen of the District Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon, and many students from the school attended to observe. Yu Yanqing had a medicated plaster on his left cheek, and testified to the court that the injury had not yet healed.

According to his testimony: he is currently employed by the Military Service Association and is studying in the fifth grade of the Law Department of Soochow University at night. He lived in the same dormitory with the two defendants and another classmate. They usually had a good relationship. On October 30th, he heard that someone was planning to sell the remaining rationed rice to supplement the non-staple food expenses. He believed that if there was any remaining rice rationed by the People's Livelihood Association, it should only be returned and not sold, and that selling it would be illegal. He reported this to the Dean of Students and the Head of General Affairs. When he returned to the dormitory at about 10 p.m., Wu immediately turned off the lights and allegedly beat him in various parts of his body. He then ran out of the dormitory, shouting for help and reporting to the school, but received no results. He then reported the incident to the nearby Hongkou Branch Bureau. Later, Dean Liu bailed out the two defendants. At the weekly meeting the following week, Dean Liu had already reported to the students about his assault and that the two had been given demerits.

Defendant Zhou Gan

Testified: "Currently a third-year student in the Law Department. In the past, my relationship with Yu was quite harmonious, but later, because he loved to brag every day and wanted us to flatter him, which we young people dislike the most, he held a grudge against us." He continued: that night he was reading in the dormitory. When Yu returned to the dormitory at about 10 p.m., he asked Yu why he insulted his friend. Then the lights went out, and he and Wu went out first. Yu then went outside and shouted "Help!" Other students in the dormitory, hearing the news, gathered to see what had happened. How Yu was injured, he really didn't know. He flatly denied selling rationed rice or fighting with Yu.

Wu Xisheng Testified

Testified: Currently a fourth-year student in the Accounting Department, and served as the chairman of the Food Committee in October. That night, because it was the end of the month, he was settling accounts in the dormitory. Later, the lights went out, and he went out first, and never participated in the beating. Regarding the plaintiff's claim that he planned to sell rationed rice, he said: The October rationed rice was distributed on the 25th. The rice eaten in the previous two weeks was purchased with loans from the school, so there was very little left by the end of the month. In the past, some students had proposed selling rice, but it was later rejected, so it was not sold. After the two defendants finished testifying, the plaintiff also said: The "friend" that Zhou Gan said he insulted was the introducer for them to sell the rationed rice. The court, considering that both parties were classmates living together day and night, instructed the defendant to apologize to Yu in court to settle the case. Yu insisted on refusing and demanded that the court severely punish them. The court then ruled to reschedule the trial, and will summon the school's Dean of Students, Head of General Affairs, and related students to testify next time.

### Rationing in Six Major Cities; Coordinated Procurement for Smoothness; The Grain Storage Committee Decides to Strive to Ensure Uninterrupted Supply

The spokesperson of the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food recently explained in detail to those capable the committee's planning for grain sources and grain allocation for the rationing of six major cities nationwide.

The committee's procurement of grain sources can be divided into: (1) Entrusting national banks to purchase from grain-producing areas. (2) US Economic Cooperation Administration's supply of foreign rice and the Administration's fertilizer-for-grain program. The committee was established in August of this year, coinciding with the government's currency reform and strict price controls. Farmers and grain merchants, in order to avoid price limits, hid agricultural products, which greatly affected the committee's purchase and transportation work. Moreover, the purchased grain was sometimes diverted for emergency military supplies. In addition, grain exports and transportation were hampered by the lack of transportation tools and the difficulties caused by local governments detaining and withholding transportation. The situation was beyond the imagination of people from all walks of life. However, even in the face of all kinds of difficulties, the committee made its best efforts to procure grain sources to ensure that the supply would not be interrupted.

The delay in rice rationing in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places in October was criticized by various parties. However, during the period of October, when the economies of major cities across the country were undergoing a major transformation and the supply of materials was abnormal, the food supply was no exception. For example, during the period of October, the committee had purchased 50,000 shi of rice in Jiangxi, which was originally intended to be distributed in Shanghai, but was unexpectedly detained by the Jiangxi Provincial Government and not released, which affected the grain source for Shanghai's October rationing. In November, the committee's supply of rationed grain to Shanghai, based on the number of households, should be 526,776 shi. In addition to the approximately 200,000 shi already delivered to the Shanghai People's Livelihood Association, the committee is urging the contracted banks to deliver the remaining 320,000 shi on time, in order to supply the Shanghai People's Livelihood Association for distribution by the 25th of this month. In addition, in order to compensate for the insufficient purchasing power of the national banks, the committee directly entrusted grain merchants to purchase, hoping to smooth the flow of grain sources.

### Purchase Funds for Cotton are Insufficient: Decision to Increase Capital by 200 Million Yuan Again; 500,000 Dan of National Cotton to be Collected by the End of this Month

[Our Newspaper News] The National Cotton Joint Purchase Committee held a routine meeting at the Central Bank yesterday. As a result of the discussion, it was considered that the existing purchase funds for cotton were insufficient for turnover. It was decided that the National Bank and the Textile Construction Company would increase their capital by 200 million yuan. It is heard that the already paid funds are more than 200 million yuan, totaling more than 400 million yuan. Up to now, private spinning mills have almost all withdrawn from the joint purchase. Therefore, the actual purchase funds are borne equally by the National Bank and the Textile Construction Company.

Another important resolution passed yesterday decided to collect 500,000 dan of national cotton by the end of this month. Up to now, a total of 210,000 dan of national cotton have been collected. The cotton collected is mostly from Hankou, accounting for about 50,000 dan. Shanghai vicinity, Xi'an, Nantong, Zhejiang, Shashi and other places are next, ranging from 30,000 dan to 10,000 dan.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Mostly Increased with Few Decreases; Cloth Market Slightly Firm; Sichuan and Guangdong Customer Sales Were Brisk

The cotton yarn market was stable, and the rise and fall of each yarn were very small. People's hearts were still quite firm, and the owners' intention to sell was still weak, but new buyers also rarely inquired. Therefore, the supply and demand on the market were balanced, and as a result, the prices of each yarn mostly increased with few decreases.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at 13,000 yuan. The trend in the middle was still strong. Around noon, there was slightly more purchasing, and the price rose to 13,500 yuan at the close, an increase of 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

21-count Double Horse spot initially opened at 10,800 yuan, the lowest was 10,400 yuan, and closed at 10,600 yuan, a slight decrease of 100 yuan. In addition, the warehouse receipt initially traded outside the 10,000 yuan mark, and the noon close still stood at the previous day's original price of 9,800 yuan.

20-count Celestial Maiden and Jincheng were unchanged. Others such as Golden Pagoda and Red Kuixing showed mixed results. All yarns below 16-count were strong.

The cloth market was slightly firm, and actual sales in Sichuan and Guangdong were brisk. The northern merchants had little interest, and the local New Cloud flower was also active, and as a result, each cloth had a slight increase.

Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 420 yuan, and the highest price was 421 yuan. At one point, due to excessive selling, the price dropped to 409 yuan. Finally, it returned to 416 yuan at the close, an increase of 6 yuan compared to the previous day.

Sijunzi serge initially opened at 425 yuan, and the price was shouted up to 430 yuan in the middle of the day. The closing price was 420 yuan, a profit of 7 yuan. In addition, warehouse receipts were traded at 410 yuan. Sijunzi Yuanzhi tribute spot was 435 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was 425 yuan, each about 5 yuan higher than the previous day.

Also news: It is heard that the unreasonable ratio of US aid cotton to cotton yarn has made the factories feel that the losses are too great to continue. Therefore, they recently held consecutive meetings to discuss appropriate solutions. According to the research results, considering the current yarn prices, the conversion ratio and the originally set weight of cotton should be increased by at least 50%. The factories have submitted a document to the Cotton Spinning Association requesting an increase in processing fees, with one package of 20-count yarn being exchanged for 705 pounds of 7/8 fiber cotton. The US Aid Cotton Group has decided to hold another meeting tomorrow to discuss and make a concrete decision.

### Production Prices Drop, Arrival Volume Booms: Rice Prices Decline Sharply; White Japonica Rice Opens at 360 Yuan in the North City

Yesterday, the rice market in both the north and south cities declined. The prices in the producing areas were still low, and transportation to Shanghai could still be profitable. Therefore, the arrival volume was still booming, and the owners were eager to sell, and the market opened with a decline. The decline in the north city was even greater than in the south city. White japonica rice dropped by 40 yuan, opening at 360 yuan. Thin indica rice dropped by 50 yuan, early rice dropped by more than 60 yuan, and indica rice and glutinous rice all dropped by 30 to 40 yuan. White japonica rice in the south city also traded at 360 yuan, a decrease of 25 yuan. Early rice dropped by 30 yuan. The arrival volume yesterday was 4,720 shi in the south city and 6,433 shi in the north city, totaling 11,153 shi.

Flour: Turned down, because it was heard that rice prices had fallen, and people's hearts were weak. Those looking for goods lacked support, and ultimately saw a decline. There were not many transactions of old car flour. The opening price was 128 yuan. The opening price of Bingchuan flour was 124 yuan, and later it fell to 122.5 yuan at the close. Old car flour fell by 9 yuan, and Bingchuan flour fell by 6.5 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng each saw a decline of 8 yuan. Bran was first tired and then strong. Rural sales were active, and it was uniquely strong at 1 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: The market turned strong. Due to the fact that customers were taking delivery of them, yellow soybeans rose by 10 yuan. There was not much arrival of Pinghu soybeans, and they rose by 10 yuan. There was a scarce supply of selected green beans, and they rose by 5 yuan. Corn uniquely fell by 5 yuan due to the limited appetite of customers. There was slight domestic demand for red sorghum, and the supply and demand were equal, and the prices were neither strong nor weak. Northern sales of mung beans were stagnant, and they were weak and tired. Sesame was stable, and high-quality raw peanuts were strong at 30 to 40 yuan.

Edible Oil: Declined, affected by the decline in rice prices. Moreover, yesterday, oil mills required payment with promissory notes and cash, resulting in not many deliveries. Most bean oil mills closed at 700 yuan, and later the returned goods were 690 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell from 600 yuan to 580 yuan, each with a decline of 40 yuan. Jilong raw oil fell by 70 yuan, and Xiao Che sesame oil fell by 20 yuan. Bean cake was not taken delivery of by customers, and fell by 5 yuan.

### Sugar Market Saw Mixed Results of Increases and Decreases

Yesterday, the sugar market was high and then stuck. People's hearts were still not encouraged. However, due to the easing of the money market, there were still more orders being absorbed, but actual sales were not smooth, and the market still lacked vitality.

No. 45 car white refined sugar in bags was not traded and remained at the original price. Packaging rose slightly by 5 yuan. No. 24 coarse granulated sugar, which had been uniquely weak among the strong, had a smooth absorption yesterday and rose by 15 yuan. Xinghua white and Xinghua red, this factory's white sugar, etc., all rose slightly by 5 yuan.

Local sugar hun diao qing fell by 5 yuan. This factory's rock sugar, Zhenji rock sugar slices, had a strong momentum the previous day, but were weak and tired. There were continuous sales on the market yesterday, and the local demand was also minimal. Market prices still plummeted, falling by 20 to 40 yuan.

### Tung Oil Steadily Firm

Amid adjustments in water and land freight rates, the tung oil market hovered in place. Although the sellers' desire to raise prices was unabated, actual sales were limited and the buying sentiment was hesitant, preventing further development. Foot-grade self-refined oil was 600 yuan per dan, and genuine Xihong was 550 yuan per barrel. The rest lacked comparison, but the foot-grade was firmer than before.

### Tea Market Firm

Since the shipment of red and green teas has continued to weaken, the price has fallen quite a bit. However, yesterday in the market, those holding goods, considering the cost involved, and also because the required funds had already been settled, again felt reluctant to easily sell them off. The situation turned to show signs of recovery, and prices unanimously showed signs of rising. The underlying tone also took a tortuous turn to become firm. As for transactions, exports of boxed tea were still mostly from export merchants with narrow margins, and not much business was done. However, the demand for domestic fancy teas from this street and other places continued to be good, and the volume of transactions remained decent.

### Export of Cotton Yarn Spun from U.S. Cotton to China, Exchange for Handkerchiefs and Cloth Exported to Hong Kong

This foreign exchange has already been allocated to the Textile Export Committee for safekeeping. Furthermore, the transactions of these handkerchiefs and cloths were purely handled by private merchants.

### Woolen Fabrics Steady

Woolen fabrics were stable yesterday, Tuesday. Zhanghua, Shanghai Dacheng, and Fufeng woolens were all offered at a wholesale price of 220 yuan per piece.

### Rescuing the Wuxi Industrial Crisis: Power Shortage, Financial Suffocation, Difficulties in Transportation and Sales; Revealing Six Major Problems, Planning Essential Mutual Assistance Measures

[Report from this newspaper, Wuxi, 6th] Recently, this county has been affected by the current situation. Banks are tightening lending, and factories are not only having difficulty raising cash to pay wages, but also suffering from the inability to circulate capital. Moreover, there is a serious power shortage. The coal reserves of the Qijian Weir Power Plant are only sufficient for half a month, and the coal stored by the Xinsha Factory is only enough for ten days. All factories in the county are facing the crisis of shutdown due to lack of power. In addition, the difficulty in replenishing raw materials and equipment, the fact that finished products are priced far below cost due to falling prices, and the obstruction of transportation, make sales extremely difficult.

Stopping or Reducing Work Easily Leads to Disputes

There are many workers in this county. Once factories stop or reduce work, it is very easy to cause disputes, shorten the life of industry, or affect social security. The Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Association, the County Council of this county, the County Chamber of Commerce, and others, considering the seriousness of the situation, held an emergency symposium at 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th to rescue the industrial crisis. Attendees included Legislators Xue Mingjian and Sun Xiangfeng, National Assembly members Xu Chizi and Ren Shixiong, as well as local community organizations and factory representatives Li Tiping, Zhang Yifei, Sun Deguang, Zheng Xiangde, and Chen Jinli, totaling more than 30 people.

Do Not Panic, Correct Things Effectively

First, Hua Jinji, Secretary-General of the Provincial Industrial Association, reported on the six major issues proposed to solve the current industrial crisis. Then, Qian Sunqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, gave a detailed analysis of the current situation, saying that today's situation is a man-made contradictory phenomenon formed under the circumstances of "panicking before there is any real panic." This contradiction has created chaos in transportation. The National Bank has also tightened lending, and rumors of the bank's withdrawal have been circulating. This should be criticized. He strongly stated that everyone should work together to maintain the overall situation.

Six Major Issues, Exchange of Opinions

Then, the six major issues were discussed, and opinions were exchanged one by one. (1) Mutual assistance and cooperation in industrial technology and equipment: it was decided to first classify each industry, elect a committee for each category, form a small group meeting, formulate a mutual assistance and cooperation plan, conduct a detailed review, and then implement it. (2) Remedying the industrial power shortage: it was decided (A) to request the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the two Ministries to jointly form a Coal Adjustment Office responsible for the coal business, and quickly allocate coal to Wuxi to prevent Wuxi industry from shutting down completely due to lack of electricity. (B) Request the Ministry of Social Affairs to quickly negotiate with the relevant ministries and commissions to quickly allocate coal to maintain Wuxi industry. (C) Request the Ministry of National Defense to quickly order the troops near the Weinan Coal Mine to quickly allocate special trains to transport large quantities of coal to enrich industrial power. (3) Industrial financial issues: it was decided (A) to request the county government to convene the heads of the National Bank bureaus in Wuxi for talks, promote cooperation with the local area, and not abandon responsibility at critical moments. (B) If the bureaus of each bank disregard local interests, immediately stop paying taxes and establish a joint bank. (C) Telegraph the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to appeal for emergency industrial loans to be handled quickly. (4) The purchase and sale of industrial raw materials and finished products: because taxes exceeded selling prices, and purchases and sales were particularly difficult, it was decided to hand them over to a small group meeting for discussion. (5) Close cooperation between labor and capital: Xue Mingjian, on behalf of the capital side, appealed to labor and capital to share weal and woe. Director Tang of the General Labor Union stated: as long as the factory is firm in its beliefs and does not shake itself first, the workers will definitely be able to cooperate with the factory to the end. (6) Industry and self-defense: it was decided to reissue national identity cards to protect the rights and safety of workers.

### Hunan-Guizhou Railway in Xiang (Hunan) and Gui (Guangxi) Provinces: Roadbed Awaiting Improvement

[Report from this newspaper, Guilin, 2nd] The Hunan-Guizhou Railway has been frequently delayed recently due to the poor maintenance of the roadbed, and accidents have occurred from time to time. According to Ting Jie, director of the Joint Office of the Railway Bureau, the reasons are: (1) poor roadbed, too many bad sleepers; (2) the entire line needs 3,000,000 new sleepers, even if only partially replaced, 1,500,000 sleepers are needed, roughly valued at more than 21,000,000 yuan. The Railway Bureau is unable to raise the money; (3) the coal used is of poor quality. The entire line currently needs more than 13,000 tons of coal per month, sourced from Heshan and Qiyang Dapu and other places. Except for the coal produced in Heshan, which is barely acceptable, the remaining coal contains nearly half sand and soil, which is not suitable for train use; (4) Heavy wheels and car body equipment are mostly made of Thai raw materials, which are not very durable. All the above points urgently need the Railway Bureau to find ways to improve them.

### Refugee Students in X Seeking Food Door to Door, a Pitiful Sight

[Report from this newspaper, Wujin, 6th] There are schools for refugee students from Shandong Province who have moved to Changzhou to resume classes, including Ziyang Normal School, Julu Normal School, Jining Normal School, Qufu Normal School, etc. The total number of students is more than 9,000, scattered in Benniu Xiaxi, Hengshanqiao and other places. They rent houses to set up schools and resume classes. Their general living conditions are very difficult. In particular, some students in Houxu have not yet been able to formally attend classes. Principal Wang of the school often stays in the Nanjing Ministry of Education to ask for money, resulting in frequent food shortages at the school. The young students have no other way to turn to, and some even beg for food door-to-door with tears in their eyes, seeking a full meal. Some female students live in several temples next to the feet of the Bodhisattvas, sleeping on some straw with three or four people sharing a quilt. Hunger and cold have devastated them, making them withered and weak. Some are even bitterly begging to be taken in as maids to get a full meal, which is extremely miserable. The local area has lent dozens of stones of rice, but it is difficult to sustain.

### Conflict Between Refugees and Police in Shitanpu, Quanxi City, Hengyang

Responsibility for the Murder Still Awaiting Trial

[Report from this newspaper, Changsha, quick dispatch, 4th] In Shitanpu, Quanxi City, Hengyang County, more than 158 refugees from Anhui Province arrived on the 29th of last month and lived in a public ancestral hall nearby. Because they were unable to buy food, they often went to people's homes to extort and rob, which disturbed the residents. The residents reported to the Quanxi City Police Station. After receiving the report, the police station sent police to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the refugees refused to obey and clashed with the police. At that time, there were too few police, and the few were no match for the many. One policeman was slashed with a horse knife by the refugees. Gunshots were fired in the chaos, and Yuan Shaosong, a local resident, was shot and injured. Two police rifles were also snatched by the refugees. According to the refugees, Zhang Haitang, a 17-year-old girl, and Zhang Si, an eight-year-old boy, went missing. Zhao Yulin, a refugee, went out to look for the two children afterwards, but they have not been found. The case is currently being tried by the Hengyang Garrison Department. The refugees insist that the police fired, while the police say that the refugees committed the murder. Whose responsibility it is has not yet been resolved.

### Sound of War Drums at the Battle of Pengcheng

— Yin Qinheng

In the Battle of Xuzhou, the 100th Army of the Army valiantly defeated the stubborn enemy. Commander Zhou Zhidao bravely took the lead, sustaining multiple wounds, and served the country with utmost loyalty, which is deeply admired. I have composed six poems in heptasyllabic verse to console him.

(1) Since ancient times, there has been much war in the Central Plains, and now the red flames are rising again. The arrow of Cheng Qing should be stopped, and the weapon to quell the disturbance should be wielded to turn back the sun. The sounds of apes and cranes follow my tears, and countless lives are lost. Several times after cockcrow, I get up to dance, and I often look up to see what the night holds.

(2) A man values merit and fame in this world, smiling as he embarks on a distant expedition with a Wu hook. The falling leaves and west wind urge the horn, and the evening colors of the turbulent river guide the perilous flags. The stars are sparse, the moon is dim, and the clouds open the formation. The earth is cracked, the sky is collapsing, and lightning sweeps the camp. I will not return until I have slain Loulan, leading my troops to defend the ancient city of Pengcheng.

(3) The general spreads his wings like an eagle, invigorating the spirit of the country, and leaves the military gate with drums beating at dawn. Golden flags cover the field, yellow banners disappear, and iron wings traverse the white sky, darkening it. The autumn sounds from beyond the Great Wall are increasingly severe, and the sword at my waist is still warm with blood. May the enemy's courage be stripped from now on, for one victory is more than enough to show.

(4) I vow to reverse the tide that has already passed, ashamed to pursue Wei Jiang's reckless words of peace. Who sprinkles heroic tears on the battlefield? The setting sun waves with the swords of brave men. The whale drum moves and the bugle plays music, and fiery oxen cross the river, spilling blood. The general has laid out a long snake formation, and he does not tire of the thousands of Hu cavalry!

(5) Who will serve the country as a shield? The sad sounds of the night startle my dreams. The night moon coldly contains the fullness of autumn colors, and the iron armor is chilled by the light of the sword. Falling flowers wash the water, buffalo and sheep face the enemy, and the cries of cranes and the roar of wind fill the grass and trees with soldiers. Why wait for the morning meal? The general sits and listens to the sound of victory!

(6) The full success of the revolution remains to be achieved. How can we allow foxes and rats to destroy our awe-inspiring city? Having gone through a hundred battles, my heart is still strong. My eyes extend to the northern plains, and my spirit has not calmed. I have often learned Sun Tzu's tactics in forming formations, and I have often emerged from the Han camp. After returning from glorious bloody battles, heaven will bless the fortunate and bring the spring of life!

Over the past ten years, it has cultivated nearly a hundred talents. Now that the lease on the Shanghai school's buildings is about to expire, a piece of land of more than one mu has been purchased on Xibaotian Road this spring to build new school buildings. Because it is not easy to raise huge sums of money at one time, we especially appeal to enthusiastic people from all walks of life to donate generously and do good deeds together.

### Communism in China, September 1948, Compiled by the American Academy Foreign Relations Committee

— Special Translation by the Newspaper Translation Office

It is difficult for us to point out a country that has made significant industrial progress without the prerequisite of stable political power. Only Switzerland and Belgium are exceptions, both of which are special cases resulting from the balance of power among major powers.

For a considerable period to come, China will not be able to rely on its own ability to guarantee against the intrusion of foreign forces. The Soviet Union is currently unable to provide protection to a particular country because they cannot put forward reasonable demands for benefits. The United Nations should clearly provide this security guarantee to all countries, but the United Nations cannot do this until the current conflict of interests between the United States and the Soviet Union is resolved, because any country can use its veto power against the other party's proposed solutions.

Among the countries of the world, only the United States has sufficient political power to provide China with an effective guarantee of territorial and political integrity. The United States has stated for the past fifty years that China's integrity is one of its important interests. It is the only strong country capable of providing this guarantee, and it can even be said that the guarantee is not an instrument of imperialist rule. The United States has clearly demonstrated in the Philippines that the region will ultimately achieve genuine independence, not just a verbal promise, but a promise that can be politically realized. The United States has taken great risks and at a significant cost, showing its unwillingness to interfere in Chinese affairs. Britain's granting of autonomy to India and independence to Burma also demonstrates a similar attitude, but it is powerless to provide China with a complete guarantee. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine solving China's political problems without simultaneously solving domestic and foreign political problems; it is even more difficult to imagine actually solving these problems without the aid of the United States. If the United States wants to resist the evil consequences of Moscow's propaganda, the determination and public announcement of its policies must be very skillful.

To make these solutions effective, China's domestic social problems must also be solved simultaneously. China needs popular education as a foundation for strengthening the modernization of everything from industry to politics. China urgently needs new elements in social life to gradually replace the original mission of the Chinese family in society, a mission that has been frustrated during the war and may not be able to restore its original importance.

These problems also involve administrative issues. China lacks trained and experienced administrators. Its craftsmanship and commercial skills have not reached the administrative efficiency we know. The accounting methods of Chinese merchants are such that he himself can report on the business situation, but an impartial auditor cannot objectively examine or estimate his business situation. Statistical methods cannot be applied in this situation, and without statistics, there can be no economic policy. For example, modern business tax cannot be based on this type of accounting.

This is a matter of ethics and business habits, not something that can be taught in school courses. This problem cannot be solved simply by sending Chinese students to study in the United States or sending American professors to China. It is closely related to the entire economic, political, and moral foundation, and its solution still depends on the solution of basic political problems.

These many partial problems—industrial, economic, political, and other problems—must be solved before the democratic problem is solved. Some people believe that democracy is a simple system that can be established simply by passing a document announcing this doctrine; this is one of the greatest mistakes of modern thought. Therefore, any country that has passed a "democratic" constitution is welcomed as a newborn democracy. However, countries that have not yet done so are denounced as being wrongheaded, malicious, and backward in will.

The spirit of democracy, no matter in which country, cannot be established in less than a generation, and it cannot be established without a good environment. The beginning of democracy is a process of development, not a sudden event. The establishment of British democracy went through a series of reforms, starting in 1832 and lasting a century, based on Parliament and the cabinet system. The emergence of American democracy was not due to the "Declaration of Independence," but due to the gradual development of democracy from the Jefferson era, through the Jackson and Lincoln eras, all the way to the era of women's suffrage. We became a democratic country after a long period of training and torture, and we have not yet reached our ultimate goal. If we expect other countries to become democratic countries in the blink of an eye, we have forgotten many of our lessons. Where we need to proceed arduously, we cannot give China a "magic carpet" to fly into the air.

China needs momentum, industry, and rapid capital accumulation, and it is urgently needed. China is eager to make legislative resolutions, and a dictatorship that can establish such resolutions more quickly than constitutionalism may be attractive.

Will China develop into a democracy? This is a very subtle question. China may, but perhaps it will not. It depends on how assistance is provided to promote conditions conducive to democracy, because the trend in the past decade has been the exact opposite, and China itself does not have the ability to reverse this trend. In terms of urgency, the most important thing is military strength and political stability, followed by the improvement of the economic situation, and thirdly, political democratization.

The general public's disappointment with the Chinese anti-communist army is probably due to the hopelessness of the future of the National Government. It is very difficult for people living outside of China to observe or perceive the existence of unorganized vitality.

Fortunately, this vitality does exist, in a form that is compatible with the local initiative rights in the Three Principles of the People. A recent example is the upsurge of popular spirit in North China. Several astute observers have praised General Fu Zuoyi of Beiping as China's most capable anti-communist leader. He mobilized local people to support his army, thereby strengthening his military power. He implemented moderate land reforms in the recovered areas to resist the Communist Party's land revolution. He trusted the people and armed the villages to defend against the Communist Party. The leftist tendencies of Beiping students have been suppressed, not by the police, but by the direct resistance of angry farmers. Although the National Government has not given him full support, under Fu's leadership, the popular spirit in the North has greatly increased, and the situation of defending the area has also greatly improved. It is becoming clear that the United States cannot write off North China as already lost, and there is even less reason to do so.

Communism has a way of making China's problems impossible to solve with Chinese tools alone. No Chinese army can quickly defeat the CCP's army. The CCP controls the rural areas, without which Chinese agriculture cannot maintain national links. The CCP controls the industrial areas of North China and Northeast China, without which the Chinese economy cannot be electrified and built. If the CCP wins the civil war, it may turn the whole country into a Soviet system. They have a doctrine that advocates using simple methods to solve all problems. The communist method avoids the practical problems of democracy, and for a country that has encountered the development that Western countries needed four centuries to achieve in one century, it seems easier and clearer in many ways than any other method.

Therefore, to solve the China problem, military and economic power are not enough. China is currently unable to mobilize sufficient military force to establish and guarantee domestic security. China will not be able to ensure that it is free from foreign interference in the near future. China cannot be self-sufficient due to a lack of materials, and cannot embark on the path of economic recovery. China cannot independently recruit management and technical personnel to support a comprehensive revitalization plan.

The United States is the only country that can make up for China's lack. In addition, the United States has other international obligations, and it must economize its financial resources so that all obligations are balanced. However, if China is saved, the balance between obligations and financial resources will improve; if China is lost, the balance will worsen.

We have pointed out that Marxism is more applicable to countries in the development stage of Europe in 1850. For so-called backward countries in the 20th century, Marxism is even more suitable than 19th-century Europe. Marxist communism has a simple blueprint for solving all economic, social, and political problems in an undemocratic way. From this point of view, the United States is essentially post-Marxist. This country has passed through the most serious problems caused by modern industrial progress without harming the essence of democratic politics. But the United States has not provided an explanation of how to learn from it for the benefit of other countries. In this regard, China is clearly a proving ground. If pre-Marxist countries can understand how to follow post-Marxist countries without falling into the detour of communism, then the goal of a peaceful and democratic world is not far away. The United States must cooperate with these countries to come up with that method. Providing China with military, economic, and political assistance is an unavoidable means of achieving our goals.

But the greatest need is intellectual cooperation between the United States and China. There are many things that need to be studied. The Communist Party has spent thirty years studying how to directly implement communism in backward countries, how to shorten the development process of capitalism, and the theory and strategy of indefinitely delaying the development of democratic politics. We have also studied and shown how to overcome the major ills of capitalism. But we have not yet reviewed or analyzed or understood our own achievements.

We have accomplished five major economic and political requirements, although they have not yet reached a perfect state, they are still in a state of continuous growth. The first requirement is private property, which is an indispensable foundation for economic personal creativity and personal dignity. The second requirement is the continuous increase in production, far exceeding the extent to which Marxists predicted that capitalism would inevitably become unproductive. The third requirement is the gradual trend of politics towards democratization and the gradual realization of freedom of speech and freedom of voting. The fourth requirement is the maintenance of the majority vote system; without this system, politics will inevitably evolve into a universal vote system. The fifth requirement is respect for the freedom of other nations, as demonstrated in the Philippines.

These principles, although not perfectly realized in the Americas - for perfection in this world, there is no hope - but in its continuous progress, it proves that the predictions of Marxists are wrong, because we have now completed things that Marx and Lenin considered impossible. Although we are still inevitably flawed and need to continue to work hard, we have already passed through fifty years of development, exceeding the erroneous scope set by the prophets of communism. This not only denies Marxism, but also recognizes the possibility of the realization of peace and freedom in human society.

Now, we must thoroughly understand why we do that, so as to give the Chinese people and many other nations a clear demonstration, so that they believe that they can also do that, that they can find a direct and accessible path from the current state to our state, avoiding the historical detours through the disasters of capitalism and imperialism. To win people's confidence, this road must at least be a shortcut that seems as attractive as communism. But the minimum is not the limit. Although this task is still far from completion, it has already begun, and a simpler, more direct, and more promising approach has already emerged. Regardless of whether our fate is war or peace, we must cooperate with China, and may cooperate with China, to seek a modern, democratic, and non-communist path for the nations of the world.
