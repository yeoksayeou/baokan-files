[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The various Northeast armies on the offensive continue to advance according to the planned schedule. The bandits have been forced to change their plan to seize western Liaoning, and appear to be urgently withdrawing their main forces. For example, the bandit Fourth Column in Xingcheng seems to be retreating eastward across the Daling River.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] National troops have entered the urban area of Anshan. On the 7th, they actively began providing relief to the returning refugees. Zhao Jie, the mayor of Anshan, is scheduled to depart from Shenyang for his post on the morning of the 8th.

### The Defense of Changchun Develops into an Offensive, Deng Wenyi Claims Reports of Withdrawal Are Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] At a press conference on the afternoon of the 7th, Deng Wenyi, the spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, confirmed only that the National Army's movement in Changchun was an "offensive." He stated that detailed information was being requested by telegram, and that its operational scope was an attack on the Dafangshen Airport. Reports of the National Army withdrawing from Changchun and retreating south to the area south of Sipingjie were deemed inaccurate by Deng. He claimed that there were approximately seventeen divisions, or more than 60,000 bandits, on the outskirts of Changchun. However, these were newly reorganized units with weaker combat capabilities. The attacking National Army is currently engaged in battle with them. Deng refused to confirm whether a decision had been made to withdraw from Changchun or not. Foreign journalists attending the press conference showed great interest in the Changchun issue, focusing almost all their questions on it. Additionally, inquiries were made about the discovery of "762 Russian-made artillery shells" north of Jinzhou. Deng was unable to provide a definitive answer, but stated that some of the shells had not exploded and were recovered by our forces. One foreign journalist remarked that if the Soviets knew their artillery shells were not exploding, they would also consider it "shameful!" The audience burst into laughter.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] On the 6th, the Beiping Telegraph Bureau was still communicating with the Changchun Telegraph Bureau, and official telegrams were still being received and sent as usual. The Changchun Municipal Government Office in Beiping received a telegram from Mayor Shang Chuandao on the 4th. Reports of the National Army beginning to withdraw from Changchun still need to be confirmed.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The Changchun garrison has recently been developing towards the southwest, but has not taken any active action. Furthermore, a portion of the bandit Twelfth Column around Changchun has moved south, appearing to be attempting to flee towards Kaiyuan.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] The National Army's offensive from Changchun continues to make progress today. The corps commander personally supervised the battle at the front line. The bandits at the Kuanchengzi Airport have been cleared, and the bandit positions on the southern high ground of Yangjiafenfang, west of Changchun, have been occupied. The National Army, which recovered Xiaofangshen last night, continues to advance today, attacking the bandit positions in Dongdafangshen and the Hui Nationality Cemetery.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] The weather here was clear today, and large numbers of Air Force transport planes arrived in succession throughout the morning and afternoon to airdrop supplies. The offensive National Army continued to make progress today. Although the sound of gunfire in the battle with the bandits could still be heard clearly, the bandits, who usually panic and fire wildly whenever planes airdrop supplies, did not fire a single shot this time. As a result, large quantities of supplies were safely dropped from a lower altitude.

### Flames of War Reignite in Shaanxi, Civilians in Chaoyi, Chengcheng, and Dali All Involved in Fighting, National Army in Bian (Kaifeng) Launches Outer Perimeter Sweeps

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 7th] The war in eastern Guanzhong has reignited. Bandit chief Wang Zhen personally led the Second Column southward from the area north of Heyang, attacking Chaoyi with great intensity. The National Army has rushed from a certain location to intercept them. Fighting has also broken out in Chengcheng, Dali, Pingmin, and other places. It is rumored that bandit leaders Xiao Ke and Han Jun have fled from southern Shanxi to the Huanglong Mountains. The Air Force has dispatched large numbers of aircraft yesterday and today to assist in the battle. Furthermore, freight trains from Xi'an to Huayin and the Xiantong Branch Line have temporarily suspended freight transport starting today.

[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 7th] Liu Ruzhen, the commander of the 68th Army stationed in Bian (Kaifeng), believing that the city is suffering from a severe shortage of food and firewood, and to expand the security zone and secure food sources, has specially dispatched his troops to launch autumn sweeps in nearby counties in the rain. The various elite units have been reporting victories every day. Ge Kaixiang's 81st Division completely suppressed most of the local Communists in the Tongxu area on the 6th. One platoon of that division even annihilated nearly 200 bandits in Sisuolou, Tongxu, on the 6th, capturing 25 alive through clever tactics.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 7th] A major battle is brewing in southern Henan. Liu's 10th and 12th Columns fled from Wangkuandian, northeast of Tongbai, to the Huyangzhen area southwest of Tanghe County yesterday. Furthermore, Liu's 11th, 3rd, and 6th Columns moved south from Jiudianbao and Anzhen, northwest of Biyang, through Yuanzezhen, northeast of Tanghe County.

### Peng Guodong Leaves Xuzhou for the Capital, Reports on the Fall of Jinan

Wu Huawen Transferred to Jiamusi for Training, Our Reporter Fan Shizhi Has Broken Through the Siege

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 7th] Peng Guodong, the Commissioner of the Shandong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, left Xuzhou for the capital on the morning of the 7th to report to the Executive Yuan on the fall of Jinan to the bandits. Before his departure, he told reporters that the defeat in the Jinan campaign was entirely due to Wu Huawen's defection. Wu had been colluding with Mao Zedong for a long time, frequently using radio stations designated to report military intelligence to Mao. This time, Mao offered him the chairmanship of Shandong as a reward, enticing Wu to defect before the battle. Wu, blinded by greed, fell into Mao's trap. Unexpectedly, after Wu's defection, he was only incorporated into the Communist East China Field Army as the commander of the First Army, and Wu himself had to be transferred to Jiamusi for six months of training first. The so-called chairmanship of Shandong was merely an empty promise. During the defense of Jinan, Wu Huawen was responsible for defending the western part of Jinan and the airport. Wu's defection opened the western gateway to Jinan, making the situation extremely precarious. Commander Wang Yao-wu was calm and alert, deploying a new line of defense that was able to hold out for another week. Commander Wang Yao-wu was wounded in the leg before the fall of Jinan, making it difficult for him to move. His escape was assisted by his guards. At the same time, the Communist officers and soldiers were determined to capture Commander Wang, with each person being issued a photograph of him. Wang's capture was almost inevitable. Commissioner Peng escaped from the inner city of Jinan on September 30th in disguise. Commissioner Peng also told reporters that several loyal journalists, such as Shen Zhuowu of the Central News Agency, Fan Shizhi of Shen Bao, and Wang Tai of Xinwen Bao, had all broken through the siege. In his judgment, their safety should not be a problem. It is noted that Shen Zhuowu, the director of the Central News Agency's Jinan branch, arrived safely in Tianjin on the 6th of this month.

### Focus of Chahar-Suiyuan Battles Shifts Eastward, Bandits Harassing Northeast of Zhangjiakou are Wavering

[Our Guihua Dispatch, 7th] The focus of the Chahar-Suiyuan battles has shifted to the outskirts of Zhangjiakou. The front lines of Suiyuan Province have been quiet in recent days, with the bandit Sixth Column hiding during the day and emerging at night.

### Legislators Focus on Economic Situation, Propose Strengthening Currency Confidence, Preventing Panic Buying, and Encouraging Production, Heated Discussions Expected at Today's Ninth Session of the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The ninth session of the second term of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 8th. The agenda includes multiple draft organization regulations for affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce submitted by the Executive Yuan for review. The discussion items include only four proposals from legislators related to the current urgent financial and economic situation. Amid the current flood of speculative capital and widespread panic buying, legislators are focusing on this serious phenomenon. They have submitted proposals with different emphases but the same goal. Heated discussions are expected at the session on the 8th. The key points of each proposal are summarized below:

1.  A proposal by Lian Mou and 62 others, urging the Executive Yuan to stop state-owned enterprises from unilaterally raising prices immediately (already published in the 6th issue of this newspaper).

2.  A proposal by Shen Chongyu and 126 others to supplement measures to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan, to enhance the credibility of the currency and facilitate its implementation. The proposal argues that the ability to maintain the value of the Gold Yuan depends on two factors: the existence of credibility, not the strictness of controls, so it is necessary to create and cultivate credibility; and the size of productivity, not the quantity of issuance, so it is necessary to increase production and expand the social capacity for the currency. Accordingly, the following measures are proposed to supplement the measures to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan: A. Regarding cultivating the credibility of issuance: (1) Increase the number of members, expand and reorganize the Issuance Supervisory Committee so that it can participate in managing and applying the issuance reserves and control the quantity of issuance. (2) The government should immediately formulate and announce a concrete fiscal plan for balancing revenue and expenditure to eliminate public concerns about the inflation of the new currency. (3) The issuance reserve fund and all the gold, silver, and foreign currency collected after August 19th should be concentrated for planned use, controlling essential goods for people's livelihoods, selling them by region to maintain production, supply civilian use, stabilize prices, and consolidate currency value. (4) Stop issuing the 5-cent silver-converted currency; all auxiliary coins under one yuan should be made of nickel, and auxiliary coins under one cent should be made of copper. B. Regarding increasing production: (1) Stipulate a method for converting all assets of production enterprises before the currency reform into Gold Yuan to offset capital. (2) The government should formulate relevant measures to promote and maintain production enterprises to develop production, improve people's livelihoods, and cultivate tax sources, including measures for financing production enterprises, measures for the government to train and reserve technical personnel for production enterprises, measures for guaranteeing the principal and interest of production enterprises, and tax exemption and reduction measures when production enterprises expand.

3.  A proposal by Liu Shidu and 46 others to prevent panic buying, encourage production, channel speculative capital, and promote national employment, to enrich material resources, stabilize prices, and realize the practical effects of economic reform. It provides eight measures as follows: (1) State-owned banks and treasuries should provide loans to production enterprises when they lack funds, but they should recover materials as much as possible through order-based loans. The government should control sufficient materials to stabilize prices. (2) For necessary machinery and raw materials that cannot be obtained domestically or whose output is insufficient, the government should encourage people to import them with their own foreign exchange or allow them to import them using import-export linking methods, and if necessary, also approve the allocation of foreign exchange appropriately. (3) There is a glut of speculative capital on the market, especially after the currency reform and the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currency, and speculative capital has increased sharply, with an even greater risk of flooding. It is urgent to guide it to engage in production, but people are wary of investing in production. The government should guarantee investors to prevent their principal and interest from suffering losses. At the same time, the heads of state-owned and private enterprises should propose comprehensive plans, guaranteeing the government that they can make profits. All production enterprises that have raised funds or increased capital due to government guarantees should be subject to close supervision by the government authorities. (4) The government should establish schools affiliated with agricultural fields and industrial and mining enterprises with relatively high achievements, recruiting out-of-school or dropout youth to study skills through part-time work and part-time study to cultivate production talents. (5) The government should recruit youths who have graduated from colleges and universities but are unemployed and redundant personnel dismissed from various government agencies, opening training classes to teach strategies for stabilizing localities and developing production, and allowing each person to study specialized technologies according to their strengths. The government should hire experts as lecturers and generalists with leadership abilities as instructors. (6) At the end of each training period, each instructor should lead the students to work in the localities. The government should appoint each instructor as an administrative supervisory commissioner or county magistrate, according to the suitability of the person and the location, allowing them to find cadres among the students themselves and lead them to assume various tasks. Those former employees who lose their jobs due to the handover should continue to attend training classes. (7) When administrative supervisory commissioners or county magistrates arrive in the localities with their cadres, they should immediately mobilize local manpower to eliminate bandits, protect public security, and carry out production enterprises. Before undertaking the aforementioned enterprises, they should prepare detailed plans and submit them to the higher-level government for approval, responsible for carrying out the plans. In counties with representative bodies, they should obtain the consent of the representative bodies, and in pacification areas, they should coordinate with military needs. (8) Large cities should implement a rationing system based on certificates to prevent citizens from panic buying. The government should stabilize the market by adjusting the market with the materials it controls and stabilizing prices.

4.  A proposal by Wu Gan and 88 others to promote the Economic Rationalization Law. This proposal argues that due to the impact of long-term inflation on the Chinese economy, various orders of production, exchange, and distribution have become extremely chaotic. In addition, the past errors in fiscal and financial policies have made the problems increasingly complex and serious. At the beginning of the establishment of the new currency, in order to correct these unreasonable phenomena and supplement the loopholes in the emergency financial and economic measures, to ensure the success of the new currency system, this "Economic Rationalization Ordinance" is proposed. The draft content is divided into five chapters: "General Provisions", "Fiscal Measures", "Secure Prices", "Channel Speculative Capital to Increase Production", and "Improve Financial Policy to Cooperate with the Comprehensive Economic Rationalization", with a total of 68 articles. The scope of the rationalization reform is very broad.

### Four Joint Offices to Close; Applications for Loan Documents to Be Suspended Starting Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Four Joint Offices held its 372nd board meeting on the morning of the 7th, chaired by President Weng. He first announced the Executive Yuan's decision on the 6th, based on the Legislative Yuan's resolution, to abolish the Four Joint Offices and close them by the end of October.

Weng continued, stating that the Four Joint Offices were established at the beginning of the War of Resistance to aggregate the strength of national banks, take unified steps, implement national policies, and assist production as its main tasks. In the future, relevant administrative and operational matters should be handled separately by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Subsequently, it was decided that the office would cease accepting applications for loan documents from October 8th. All outstanding loan cases will be transferred to the Central Bank for review and processing. Files and documents belonging to the administrative management section will be transferred to the Ministry of Finance for takeover, with the closure scheduled before the end of this month. Furthermore, the production loan policy for the future was also discussed at today's meeting. However, since the decision to abolish the Four Joint Offices has already been made, various principles and articles should be amended accordingly. It was decided to first have the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank jointly invite the heads of various banks, bureaus, and treasuries to discuss amendments before submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### Editorial: On the Battle of the Western Liaoning Corridor

After the retreat from Jinan, the focus of the war shifted to the Western Liaoning Corridor. Attacking Western Liaoning is a strategy long planned by the Communist bandits. Their so-called "Autumn Offensive" aims to open the Western Liaoning Corridor, coordinate with the interior, and connect with the Shandong Peninsula. Defending Western Liaoning is a plan long established by the National Army. For months, the National Army has resolutely defended Changchun and Shenyang to contain Lin Biao and prevent him from moving south to Jinzhou and seizing Western Liaoning. This is a struggle for the gateway to the Northeast, and the fate of the entire Northeast depends on the success or failure in the Western Liaoning Corridor. According to a special dispatch from our newspaper in Shenyang, the Communist bandits are currently exerting all their strength to seize the Western Liaoning Corridor, forcing the National Army to fight to the death. The National Army is also intensifying its troop movements and has prepared a massive annihilation battle formation, vowing to completely collapse the bandit army. It is learned that the Communist bandits have deployed a total of five columns to attack Jinzhou and Jinxi, appearing to be launching a full-scale attack. On the National Army side, in addition to Fan Hanjie's corps, the Navy and Marine Corps have begun making emergency deployments in Huludao. There are also reports that the troops defending Changchun in isolation may break through and move south to reinforce Jinzhou. Judging from the situation, all forces are converging on Western Liaoning, and the focus of the overall war situation will completely shift here. This is something that deserves our deep attention.

In modern warfare, in terms of battles, the focus is on seizing key points and lines, not surfaces; in terms of strategy, the focus is on seizing gateways and ports. The National Army's past decline in the Northeast was due to its inability to secure surfaces while trying to defend lines and losing key points while trying to defend lines, seemingly trapping itself in a dead end. Fortunately, Western Liaoning is held, blocking Lin Biao's army. The resolute defense of Changchun and Shenyang has contained the bandit army's movements. While the National Army's defense of Changchun and Shenyang requires effort, the bandit army's inability to advance directly and even connect the railways demonstrates even greater effort. Therefore, the battle in the Northeast is entirely a war of attrition. Why wouldn't Lin Biao want to easily capture Changchun and Shenyang? It's just that he assessed his strength as insufficient and unwilling to pay a higher price. Why couldn't the National Army in Changchun and Shenyang shift from defense to offense? It's just that the time for a shift in the overall situation has not yet matured, requiring calm patience to observe the changes. In terms of the situation, the National Army holds the Western Liaoning Corridor, allowing Jinzhou to still echo Fanyang remotely, and Shenyang remains a supporting point for Changchun. If the strength in Western Liaoning increases, not only will the connection between Jinzhou and Shenyang become possible, but it may even be possible to revive the "dead piece" that is Changchun. Conversely, if the bandit army can occupy the Western Liaoning Corridor, it will not only complete the encirclement of Shenyang in the east but also be able to develop westward, gradually shrinking the encirclement of Pingjin. Therefore, the bandit army constantly wants to seize Jinzhou and its surrounding areas, trapping the National Army in Changchun and Shenyang in a situation where it cannot advance or retreat.

The Western Liaoning Corridor is the gateway to the Northeast and also the gateway to North China's interior and the ocean. The current Western Liaoning Corridor is threatened by Lushun and Dalian, resulting in a fragmented situation, but it has not yet reached the point of complete collapse. Why does the National Army insist on defending this fragmented situation and continues to invest fresh troops? Rather than saying it is to consolidate Changchun and Shenyang, it is more accurate to say it is to secure North China. This is determined by the geographical position of the Western Liaoning Corridor, forcing a change in dire circumstances. Gu Zuyu, in his book "Reading History and Geography," discussed the strategic importance of various regions, overlooking the Northeast and Northwest frontiers but placing particular emphasis on the Western Liaoning Corridor. This is determined by historical developments. Therefore, those who protect the world today must secure the Western Liaoning Corridor. Gu Zuyu analyzed the importance of the Western Liaoning Corridor, saying, "It controls and captures the Rong and He tribes, isolates the islands, relies on dangers and distance, and is sufficient to seal itself off. The Khitans occupied this area to harass China. The Jurchens also started their expansion here to destroy the Liao and weaken the Song. The Mongols took eastern and western Liaoning, and the Jurchens' foundation was destroyed. Since ancient times, those who have possessed Liaodong have often used it to encroach on You and Ji, causing disaster for the Central Plains." This shows that Western Liaoning is not only the gateway to the Northeast but also the gateway to North China's interior. The stage of fighting for lines and surfaces in the Northeast war has passed, and it has now reached the stage of fighting for key points and gateways. This war will not only determine the ultimate fate of the Northeast strategically but also have a significant impact on the situation in mainland North China.

The Northeast is the Northeast of the Republic of China, so the success or failure in the Northeast is of utmost importance to the fate of China. To resolutely defend Western Liaoning, secure North China, and thereby break through the Northeast, requires the effort of the entire nation. Therefore, the struggle in the Northeast is a struggle for the fate of the entire nation. We should pay attention to the battle of the Western Liaoning Corridor with a sense of urgency and consider how to fundamentally clarify the path for the Northeast. It is unacceptable to simply observe the gains and losses of one city or one area.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Raymond P.

Brandt is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 8th. In addition, White, commander of the US Navy's Western Pacific Fleet, arrived in Beiping with Brandt and others.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] Mr. Qu Lang, the US advisor to the Executive Yuan representing President Weng Wenhao, came to Shenyang a few days ago to inspect industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Yen Chia-kan, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee, told reporters on the afternoon of the 7th that in addition to exchanging views with the ECA on relevant issues regarding US aid during his trip to the US, he also exchanged many views specifically on industrial parts and construction plans. The allocation of 70 million US dollars in special funds for industrial construction was also a topic of discussion. Among them, in addition to 35 million US dollars for industrial parts, another 35 million US dollars has been decided to be used in part for rural reconstruction, and the rest for construction and engineering design. Regarding the allocation of industrial parts, in addition to the more than ten institutions that have been successively agreed upon to receive industrial parts assistance, there are also some preliminary principles being discussed, which will be reviewed and announced successively after returning to China. For those that have been decided, funds will be allocated only after the engineering design is completed, and the actual amount of funds allocated will be based on the amount approved by the actual design. Yen went on to talk about the US's attitude towards aiding China, saying that at least economically, progress has been quite smooth, and its progress is definitely no less than that of any other European country receiving aid. As for the prospects for future aid, Yen said that the general sentiment in the US is that on the one hand, it hopes that China can help itself, and on the other hand, it also hopes to aid China. Therefore, before the next US Congress, it is hoped that China can make good use of US aid and also complete self-help plans. In the future, 30% of US aid to China will be in the hands of the US, and 70% will still be in the hands of China. At the same time, the US's understanding of China's crisis has also become more sufficient than before, so everything still depends on our country being able to do well for itself.

### New Turning Point in Atomic Energy Dispute, Six Countries to Reopen Negotiations, Political Committee Passes New Zealand Proposal, Subcommittee Established to Draft Resolution

[News Report] Paris, 7th (Broadcast): A new turning point was reached on the 7th regarding the dispute over atomic energy control. The Soviet Union proposed to restart negotiations on atomic energy control. At the same time, the Western powers changed their attitude and agreed to spend at least another year seeking a satisfactory solution. Previously, the New Zealand representative suggested to the Political Committee that the five major powers, the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and France, and Canada reopen negotiations to seek a satisfactory solution for international control of atomic energy, which was supported by the US representative. According to the New Zealand proposal, a subcommittee composed of the five major powers and Canada will be organized to study whether an agreement on atomic energy control is possible between the East and the West. Some representatives believe that reorganizing the subcommittee will invalidate the work of the Atomic Energy Commission for the past two years and start from scratch. The Soviet representative Malik disagreed, arguing that reopening negotiations could lead to satisfactory results. The Ukrainian representative also advocated for a new discussion to seek a comprehensive agreement. The Western representatives abandoned their proposal to end negotiations with the Soviet Union on atomic energy. The Canadian representative suggested that the two-year atomic energy negotiations, which had yielded no results, be completely stopped and requested the Political Committee to submit the US control plan to the UN General Assembly for approval. The subcommittee organized according to the New Zealand proposal will re-examine the atomic energy issue, decide whether and when the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission should resume work, and consider the Soviet Union's proposal at this General Assembly, namely, to simultaneously ban atomic bombs and establish an international control organization. The New Zealand representative suggested (1) request the six permanent members of the Atomic Energy Commission to discuss whether there is a basis for reaching an agreement on international control; (2) when a basis is found, suggest that the six-nation subcommittee reopen the Atomic Energy Commission meeting; (3) order the six permanent members of the Atomic Energy Commission to report the results of the discussions to the 1949 General Assembly. Finally, the Political Committee submitted the case to a vote. As a result, the organization of the subcommittee was passed with 47 votes to 0 (5 abstentions) to review various suggestions related to atomic energy and draft a resolution for submission to the General Assembly for approval.

### Security Council Without Regular Recess, Representatives of Six Neutral Countries Contacted Behind the Scenes, Seeking Peaceful Resolution of Berlin Problem

[United Press Paris, 7th] After the Security Council decided to adjourn indefinitely on the 6th, the discussion of the Berlin crisis has moved behind the scenes. According to well-informed sources, the adjournment of the Security Council is to give the Soviet Union sufficient time to consider the Western proposal, that is, after the Berlin blockade is lifted, to resume the four-power foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the entire German problem. It is reported that representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are holding private consultations to decide whether to submit a proposal to the Security Council to order the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade.

At the same time, the other seven countries of the Security Council are also said to be using the recess period to discuss the Western proposal and prepare their attitudes towards the measures that the Security Council should take.

[French Press Agency Paris, 6th] Councilors of the Security Council who are not directly related to the Berlin incident have now begun new efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the problem. Among them, the representatives of China, Colombia, Syria, Belgium, Canada, and Argentina held a brief meeting this morning and reconvened for an hour in the afternoon, chaired by Argentine representative Bramuglia. According to well-informed sources, the intention of these neutral countries is that the draft resolution must be agreed upon by all parties before it is submitted to the Security Council, and the Soviet Union must avoid exercising its veto power. These six countries also advocate that the Soviet Union make a "symbolic" lifting of the Berlin blockade and ask the four powers to continue direct talks to seek a peaceful resolution to their differences. These six countries will use the opportunity of the Security Council's suspension of meetings in the next few days to continue consultations. According to responsible sources, although these six countries are making informal contact with the Western powers and the Soviet Union, they will eventually try to make direct contact with them.

### Threatening Berlin Air Transport, Soviet Aircraft Conduct Live Bombing, Anti-Aircraft Fire Targeting in the Air Like a Real Battlefield, British and American Occupation Authorities Protest

[United Press Berlin, 7th] Soviet bombers dropped live bombs in the suburbs of Berlin at noon on the 7th. A British pilot said that he witnessed bombs exploding on the ground after Soviet bombers flew over ten miles north of the French part of Berlin. Two other British pilots said they had seen Soviet aircraft practice, but did not see bombs explode. There were several Soviet aircraft involved in the exercise. The British pilot said that they made three round trips to drop bombs.

The Soviet Union had previously stated that there would be several exercises, but there was no live bombing on the list. And only this batch of bombers was found to be participating in the exercise. Earlier, the Soviet side notified Western countries that Soviet aircraft would conduct a full-scale air combat exercise in the air corridors and over Berlin, forming the most serious threat to the British and American air transport to Berlin. It is said that the exercise will be from 5 AM to 6 PM, including anti-aircraft fire, parachuting, aerial target shooting, and bombing fighter groups flying alone or in formation. In the past, the Soviet Union had repeatedly threatened, but none of them had been realized. This exercise, if only partially carried out, could seriously threaten the air transport to Berlin. The Soviet notification has been rushed to Major General Hayes, Deputy Chief of Staff of the US military. The British and American sides immediately protested to the Soviet side about the dropping of live bombs in accordance with the Four-Power Aviation Safety Agreement. According to the Soviet announcement, its exercise plan includes: (1) Implementing aerial target shooting in the US air corridor from Frankfurt to Berlin; (2) Practicing anti-aircraft artillery in the British corridor from Hamburg to Berlin; (3) Parachuting exercises in the British corridor from Bookerburg to Berlin; (4) Strafe ground in the Corsen area; (5) Flying over Berlin in formation; (6) Taking off from the seven airfields along the Western corridor, flying alone or in formation. The notice only stated that large groups of aircraft would fly in the corridors at altitudes from 300 to 15,000 feet, without mentioning the shooting height and time.

### Fire on Fuxing East Road: Multiple Houses Destroyed; Impacting the Water and Wood Industry Welfare Association; Loss of Over 700 Dan of White Rice

[Report from this newspaper] At 6:15 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out at the Shengtailai Clothing Store at 325 Fuxing East Road (intersection of Zhonghua Road). A apprentice, Xu Renxing, was cooking breakfast when he went out to chop firewood, and the firewood in the stove fell into a pile of rags, causing a fire. The shops in the area were all made of wooden boards and bamboo fences, so the fire spread quickly. The Nanshi Fire Brigade arrived and made every effort to extinguish the fire. It took more than an hour to put out the fire completely. In addition to the complete destruction of the Shengtailai Clothing Store, the fire also spread to the neighboring Hexing Roundwork at 327, the Yuantongxing Laundry at 321 and 323, and the Zhenwu Tobacco and Wine Store at 315.

The apprentice Xu Renxing who caused the accident and the housewife Xu Zhang Wenqin were both taken to the Yimiao Police Branch for interrogation.

### Ticket Scalpers' Skills Exhausted; Order Restored in Stores; New Fashion Goods 50% Higher

[Report from this newspaper] Since the authorities issued an order requiring the presentation of a national identification card of this city to purchase retail goods and restricted the quantity of purchases, the "ticket scalpers'" skills have been exhausted, and the trend of panic buying has also weakened. Most stores are now organizing their inventory and continuing to supply retail sales as usual in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, so order has returned to normal. However, fashion stores had the best business during this round of panic buying, and almost all of their inventory of wool fabrics was sold out. As a result, the current prices of new goods in the industry are quite expensive, generally about 50% higher than the "August 19th" prices. For example, a long-haired velvet women's coat that sold for 120 yuan two weeks ago now sells for 180 yuan. Other fur goods are even more expensive. The cheapest yellow wolf fur coat costs 1,500 yuan, an otter fur coat costs about 3,000 yuan, and a gray-backed coat costs at least 5,000 yuan.

### Rice Industry Holds Emergency Meeting; Once Causing Fierce Dispute; Agreed on Quotas for Procuring Food; Wan Molin in Charge of 15,000 Dan

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of rice supply, Supervisor Jiang summoned Wan Molin, Chairman of the Rice Industry Association, and Yin Fuxiang and Xu Songren, the persons in charge of the North and South markets, the day before yesterday, ordering them to guarantee a monthly supply of 250,000 dan of rice to the city. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the Rice Industry Association convened an emergency industry meeting at the South Market to discuss how to effectively procure the rice. Most of the rice merchants who attended the meeting stated that they should comply with the order to procure and transport rice for the country's people. However, there was a fierce dispute over the allocation of responsibilities. The board of directors initially proposed that each rice store be responsible for procuring 60 dan of rice per month. With over 2,000 rice stores in the city, the total could reach 150,000 dan. The remaining 100,000 dan would be borne by rice mills and distributors, totaling about 300 to 400 households. However, the rice stores, due to their small capital and traditionally retail nature, do not directly procure rice. They have recently made efforts to directly purchase from the production areas to help solve the food problem. Now, the allocation of responsibilities is more than that of the rice mills and distributors with strong capital, which is considered extremely unfair, and they have spoken out and argued. Later, at the suggestion of an official from the Bureau of Social Affairs, representatives from rice mills, distributors, and rice stores discussed and negotiated, and finally decided on the following allocation of responsibilities: Rice mills are responsible for procuring 105,000 dan of rice per month, rice mills are responsible for 45,000 dan per month, distributors are responsible for 30,000 dan per month, and rice stores are responsible for 55,000 dan per month. Chairman Wan Molin is also personally responsible for 15,000 dan, for a total of 250,000 dan. If there are practical difficulties during procurement and transportation, they should report to Supervisor Jiang for assistance in solving them. Also, no rice arrived at the North Market yesterday, and about 400 dan of goods arrived at the South Market.

### Prosecution of Sun Yuankui and Others for Setting Up Private Radio Station for Profit

[Report from this newspaper] Sun Yuankui from Rugao, starting in April of this year, colluded with Wu Liangzhi from Taizhou and Hu Zhongmin from Zhuji to set up a private radio station in a shack at 1237 Jujiazui Road. They reported commercial information on cotton yarn and grain to Nantong, Taixian, Rugao, and Qidong daily, charging merchants for radio fees for profit. Sun was responsible for maintenance, Wu was responsible for receiving and sending messages, Hu was responsible for liaison, and Zhang Xisheng, who delivered newspapers, was responsible for sending messages. Another resident of Zhenhai, Wu Zhaorui, assisted from the side. The profits were divided as follows: Sun and Wu received 35% each, Hu received 35% alone, and Zhang received 30%. The police bureau received a report and went to arrest them at 7:00 p.m. on the 3rd of last month, confiscating three-lamp radio receivers and other equipment. The thousand suspects were handed over to the Songhu Garrison Command. After questioning, it was clarified that Sun and others did not have military status or pro-Communist suspicions, so they were transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. It is learned that the investigation by the District Attorney's Office has concluded, and Sun and others have been prosecuted according to law for the crime of setting up a private radio station.

### "Floating Sickness," "Herd Mentality," "Hedonistic Mania": Abnormal Psychology Creates Distorted Social Phenomena; Shanghai People Seek Their Own Troubles

[Report from this newspaper] The panic buying trend in various places has gradually eased yesterday. Looking at the so-called "panic buying queues" in front of various stores in the past few days, a little analysis reveals that the general public is psychologically infected with "floating sickness." This social disease is what the managing authorities should pay attention to in the future and should develop appropriate countermeasures. In the so-called "panic buying queues," in addition to a portion of "ticket scalpers" intending to profit from the opportunity, most citizens do not urgently need the materials they want to buy, such as wool fabrics. The consumption quantity in a middle-class family is originally very limited. The reason for over-purchasing and storing this time, and even withdrawing deposits that have been deposited in the bank (according to the reporter's investigation, more than 70% of these deposits are new accounts opened after August 19th, and seem to be the surplus funds obtained after exchanging old gold bills), is because they are misled by what others say. Often, a household in a certain neighborhood returns from shopping and tells people that the price of a certain material is extremely cheap, and that stores will soon be out of stock and may not be able to buy it this winter. Then, they tell each other, even though it has no basis, the rumors spread and evolve into reason. The households in the same neighborhood then rush to compete for purchases.

This psychological floating phenomenon is especially easy to see in the queues. The reporter personally saw several housewives lining up in front of a woolen thread store in the early morning. Because they could not stand the crowding and waiting for a long time, they withdrew one after another, and frequently said, "We can always buy it in the future." It can be seen that they originally had no predetermined plan, and it is also sufficient to prove the harm of the "herd mentality" in Shanghai society.

In terms of the entertainment industry, the "floating sickness" has also been fully demonstrated in recent weeks: cinemas and theaters are thriving, and even second and third-run cinemas showing old films are often full. There are no vacant seats in the dance halls, and it is almost impossible to turn around in the dance floor. The scenic cities near this city are filled with "Shanghai guests," and the occupancy rate of each hotel has increased tenfold. The reason for this is still that the general former speculators are initiating it. Since various markets are controlled and there is no place to use force, they are unwilling to invest their idle funds in production, so they call friends and associates to enjoy themselves. As the trend spreads, relatives and subordinates slightly related to them feel that it is time to enjoy themselves. As a result of the psychological floating, the entertainment industry has experienced unprecedented prosperity.

Because dance halls are often full and there are not enough seats, some dancers eat inside after the tea dance time is over, waiting for the evening session to start, and always stay there for fear of losing their seats. Other smaller dance halls, which usually lack the patronage of wealthy guests, have rows of cars parked in front of them recently, which is already a common sight. According to most dancers, their services have also been in short supply recently, and their income has increased sharply. Those with more mediocre looks have also increased their daily income several times compared to before. Although the authorities have repeatedly stipulated that dancers must purchase dance tickets to pay dance fees, almost all transactions are now done in cash, especially during tea dance time. The dance halls claim that their business is not as prosperous as rumored, and that the small number of dance tickets is the biggest reason they cite.

In addition, the "floating sickness" is most clearly expressed in restaurants and eateries. After the last decision to refuse to purchase black market vegetables, more valuable items such as chicken, fins, and ginseng have gradually decreased in supply, but there are still wealthy customers who make reservations with restaurants, asking them to find ways to purchase them at black market prices, only to ensure that the dishes are exquisite, and they are willing to pay at black market prices. It is considered a miracle that restaurants and eateries in the city cannot be full every day. According to waiters, diners have recently been particularly fond of hiring prostitutes to serve wine. When asked about the prostitute houses, they also admitted that "hall assignments" have increased sharply in the past month, and customers book an average of 600 yuan per table every day. According to their observations, many customers recently seem to have a "hedonistic mania," which is actually rooted in the "floating sickness." How to calm this disease is a major task for the managing authorities in guiding social and economic order.

### Attempt to Manufacture Artificial Diamonds and Defraud $20,000 USD; Two Soviet Suspects Arrested in Tianjin and Shanghai

[Our Report] Karl Hoff, a stateless diamond merchant currently residing in Room 917 of the International Hotel, was recently defrauded of a substantial sum of $20,000 USD by his Soviet friend, Baoliya Gaofu, in collusion with Jidisi (formerly a chemist), an employee of the Soviet International Refugee Office, under the pretext of testing artificial diamonds. Hoff promptly reported the incident to the police, and Zhu Mengwei and Tao Genrong, section chiefs of the Criminal Investigation Department, launched an investigation. They successively apprehended Ji and Bao at Room 11, No. 195 Changde Road, and No. 38 Datong Road in Tianjin. After thorough interrogation, both confessed to the crime. They are scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today. The case unfolded as follows: Bao and Ji, claiming to be able to manufacture artificial diamonds, solicited $20,000 USD from Hoff as an experiment fee. In the laboratory, they seized an opportunity when Hoff was not paying attention and switched his bag of cash with a fake paper package. They then pretended to accidentally burn it to ashes with a chemical liquid. Afterwards, Bao and Ji feigned a quarrel. Finally, Bao pretended to agree to compensate $10,000 USD and scheduled a meeting at the Didisi Cafe the next day to hand over the money. However, they disappeared without a trace on the appointed day. Only then did Hoff realize he had been deceived and reported the matter to the police, leading to the eventual resolution of the case.

### Proposal to Construct a Dedicated Warehouse for Dangerous Goods

[Our Report] According to a spokesperson for the Municipal Warehouse Industry Association, regarding the storage of dangerous goods in warehouses, although the authorities have taken active preventative measures since the Zhongsheng Warehouse fire, ordering the relocation of dangerous goods to suburban warehouses, the warehouses in the city are concentrated in the central district. Even if the dangerous goods are ordered to be moved, the result is that they remain within the central district. Furthermore, the frequent relocation of dangerous goods increases the risk. Recognizing this, the association has petitioned the Municipal Government, suggesting that the city allocate public land to construct a dedicated warehouse for the storage of dangerous goods. The construction cost would be partially loaned by the municipal bank, with the remaining half raised by the association through inviting merchants to subscribe to shares. It is reported that the authorities are sympathetic to this proposal and are considering it.

### Brewers Illegally Procuring Broken Rice Prosecuted After Being Intercepted

[Our Report] Lu Qizhong and Yang Jugen, winemakers from Wuxi, transported over eighty containers of homemade spirits to Shanghai in September of this year and sold them to Cheng Linsheng, the owner of the Tongtaiyuan Wine and Rice Store.

The broken rice was used to offset the payment for the spirits. Subsequently, they hired a boat to transport all the rice back to Wuxi. However, they were intercepted by the Yangjing Police Sub-bureau. After being handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, they were prosecuted for violating the National General Mobilization Law and the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption.

### Military Drama Erupts on Streetcar: Several Air Force Officers Injured

[Our Report] At around 8:10 PM last night, five or six Air Force 20th Brigade, 2nd Squadron officers, including lieutenants and second lieutenants, accompanied by several female companions, boarded streetcar No. 193 on Route 1 from the Gongyuan Bazichang (park shooting range), intending to get off at the Bund on Nanjing Road. However, upon reaching their destination, they forgot to disembark. When the streetcar passed the station and continued moving, they ordered the driver to stop. At that time, conductor Chen Zhiqing, No. 2474, rang the bell to open the door but grumbled, causing one of the last Air Force officers to snatch his ticket board. Chen immediately pursued, intending to retrieve it. Driver Xu Hongchun, No. 281, also rushed up to help, assisting in demanding it back. During the commotion, Xu was slapped twice in the face, and a gunshot was heard amidst the chaos. At that moment, streetcars on Routes 1, 2, 7, 8, etc., arriving one after another, all came to a halt. The incident caused a standstill from the Bund along Nanjing Road to Henan Road, and as far as Yangjingbang, involving over fifty streetcars. Conductors and drivers from various streetcars swarmed to the scene. As a result, several Air Force officers were injured in the brawl, including Yan Kairen, Wu Pengnian, Ma Shiquan, and Yun Hang. In addition, a soldier of the Northeast Military Region Citizens' Team, wearing a yellow uniform, who was watching from the sidelines, was mistakenly identified as an Air Force member and suffered severe chest and abdominal injuries, coughing up blood. Upon receiving the report, military and police authorities dispatched Yan Zi, the first battalion commander of the Garrison Command, and his personnel to the scene. Feng, the Huangpu Branch Bureau Chief, along with Section Chief Li, also arrived and urgently summoned ambulances to transport the injured officers to hospitals such as Gongji and Renji. Driver Xu Hongchun, conductor Chen Zhiqing, and others were taken to the Huangpu Branch Bureau. The Garrison Command's Commander Yan, together with police officers and Air Force investigators, interrogated them to ascertain the cause of the incident, which took approximately two hours. Simultaneously, they worked diligently to restore traffic. By 11 PM, streetcars on all routes resumed normal operation. The assault incident is currently being handled impartially.

### In the Case of Assaulting the Wife of a National Representative, Li Xiaohou's Testimony is Extremely Vague, and He Asked to Review the Record for a Long Time Before Being Returned to Custody

[Our Report] In the case of Min Binru, the wife of Wang Guanying, a National Representative from Jiangxi residing in this city, who was violently attacked with an iron pipe by Li Xiaohou (also known as Li Chongguang) at her residence on the morning of August 8th of this year, the District Prosecutor's Office previously prosecuted Li on charges of assault and attempted murder. The District Court held its initial hearing yesterday morning. The defendant, Li Xiaohou, wore a gray wool suit, did not tie his tie, and appeared emaciated. Before the interrogation, he repeatedly stated that the relationship between him, Wang Guanying, Min Binru, and her sister-in-law was extremely complicated. He stated that he was currently collecting evidence from various sources and requested the court to postpone the trial, which the court denied.

According to Li's testimony, he is currently 38 years old. He met Wang Guanying in Chongqing in 1944. After the victory, he came to Shanghai. Due to many complicated reasons, he had no choice but to reside at Wang's home. Min's younger sister-in-law also lived in another house in Wang's residence. After Min's husband left Shanghai for Nanjing, she often used excuses to talk to him, and he tried his best to avoid getting close to her. On the evening of August 7th (the night before the incident), he entertained a friend who had just returned from the United States and returned to his residence very late. Upon arriving, he saw Min and a tenant named Wang talking in the pavilion. Min told him that Mrs. Wang was willing to pay for his expenses for entertaining his friend. He immediately declined. He then took off his shirt and trousers and went outside to cool off. When he returned to the room to sleep, Min's sister-in-law suddenly entered and requested to speak with him on Min's behalf. At this point, the court considered that his testimony seemed to have no direct relationship to the fact that he plotted to harm Min Binru, and the complicated relationship he mentioned was also extremely vague. The court then asked him if he had any mental illness, to which he firmly replied "No." He continued to testify that Min was the first to attack, and he retaliated with an iron pipe, with absolutely no intention of killing her. As for the prosecutor's indictment that he often issued bad checks, causing Min to constantly satirize him, leading him to harbor resentment and commit the assault, he claimed that it was Min's post-event embellishment and not the truth. Subsequently, neither the plaintiff, Min Binru, nor the witness, Wang Guanying, appeared. The court ordered a postponement for further hearing. Before being returned to custody, the defendant requested to review the clerk's record of his testimony in court, which he did for a long time before leaving.

### Method for the Payment of Principal and Interest on the 1947 U.S. Dollar Bonds; Principal and Interest on Bonds Should Be Deposited in the Central Bank

[Our Report] Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures, inquiries have been made regarding any changes in the method for paying principal and interest on the 1947 U.S. Dollar Bonds, as well as the following questions: (1) Whether holders of special coupons for principal and interest that have matured but not yet been paid can still receive U.S. dollars without restrictions during the effective period. (2) Whether holders of the aforementioned principal and interest coupons can exchange them for Gold Yuan and have the managing bank issue a U.S. dollar draft payable to the Central Bank, which the coupon holder can then sell to the Central Bank. (3) How to pay the principal and interest due at the end of September of this year. The managing bank has submitted these questions to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation. The Ministry of Finance has submitted the following instructions to the Executive Yuan for approval:

(1) Principal and interest on the bonds that have matured but not yet been paid before August 19th of this year should still be paid in U.S. dollars during the effective period. However, the foreign exchange obtained by the bond's special coupon holder should be exchanged by the managing bank for a U.S. dollar draft payable to the Central Bank, which the coupon holder deposits into the Central Bank or its authorized bank, and then utilized according to the "Central Bank's Regulations on the Payment of Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange Deposits."

(2) Whether the holders of these bonds are domestic or foreign, if they wish to exchange the matured principal and interest for Gold Yuan, they can all sell the U.S. dollar drafts issued by the managing bank to the Central Bank to exchange for Gold Yuan, and the service fee will be waived.

(3) The principal and interest due at the end of September of this year and thereafter will be handled in accordance with the above two provisions.

Regarding the above points, the Central Bank has informed all its branches and offices to investigate and implement them in accordance with the instructions from the Ministry of Finance.

### Rice Arrivals Slightly Increased; Oil Market Temporarily Suspended Yesterday by Order

The arrival of rice increased slightly yesterday, totaling 453 shi (a unit of volume) and 5 dou (a smaller unit of volume), all arriving at the Nanshi market. The arrival in the Beishi market remained at zero. The majority of the arrivals in the Nanshi market were indica rice, with 30 shi of white japonica rice. Sales were conducted at the limited price, but there was too much demand and not enough supply, making it difficult to purchase. Transactions were virtually at a standstill. Because there were no arrivals in the Beishi market, it remained closed.

Flour

The market remained suspended. Although retailers received allocations from factories, it was not enough to meet demand.

Grains

There were slight transactions in the sluggish market. Over 100 packages of Poyang yellow soybeans opened at a price of 13.8 yuan. Over 300 packages of Poyang black soybeans were acquired by oil factories, opening at 12 yuan. Over 200 packages of sesame seeds were traded. Over 100 packages of raw kernels opened, mostly ungraded.

Cooking Oil

The market was ordered to temporarily suspend trading yesterday. Businesses still gathered as usual, so the first day of the suspension did not seem deserted. Most people left after idle talk. Retailers on this street are waiting for allocation to meet market demand.

### Sugar Market Softens

The sugar market trended weaker yesterday. Supply exceeded demand, and morale was scattered. To thoroughly implement the limited price, the association will adopt a distribution method for free trading. As a result, businesses rushed to sell, but the appetite on this street was still strong, and sales were not weak. The market closed softer and then leveled off. The 22nd-period sugar white remained unopened. The 20th-period middle sugar, the native factory cotton white, slightly rose by one jiao (a tenth of a yuan). The remaining transactions were conducted according to the limit, and the price remained unchanged. Xinghua white, Gaozhang red, and Hainan red were abundant in the market, but the appetite was not strong, and the market situation saw further contraction.

### Pawnshop Industry Requests Interest Increase

The Pawnshop Industry Association, because the authorities reduced the interest rate to 1.3 fen (a hundredth of a yuan) per month, dispatched representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to petition for an increase.

The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.

### Silk Market Quiet; Silk Fabrics Still Popular

The source of raw silk is becoming increasingly scarce, transactions are sluggish, and the market situation is dull. Silk companies are requesting the China Trust Bureau to allocate silk, but the result of the negotiations has not been permitted, and morale is quite uneasy. The amount of stock entrusted by the association for distribution is also decreasing daily. The daily limit of 100 packages for distribution was still fully subscribed yesterday. Due to the strong sales of silk fabrics in recent days, morale is firm, and the appetite of the silk weaving industry is not weak. However, businesses are very reluctant to sell, and transactions have turned cold. No transactions have been heard in the industry.

Silk fabrics are still selling well in the market, and the market situation is sharp. Demand for the latest patterned goods is still strong, morale is buoyant, and current goods in the market are extremely scarce.

### Cotton Cloth Transactions Shift Location

The cotton yarn and cotton cloth markets continue to be closed, and news is quiet. However, the general cloth businesses have lost their point of transaction. The Leyuan Teahouse on Jiujiang Road in this city has a cotton cloth tea party, which is small in scale and a place for piecemeal cloth trading. Since the closure of the cloth market, the transactions at the tea party have suddenly become lively. The prices are still within the limit, hovering on the limit line. In addition, the textile construction company distributed cloth as usual yesterday.

### Money Exchange Industry Exchange Margin; Half to Be Paid Before Capital Increase

[Our Report] Representatives from the National Money Exchange Industry Association, Qin Runqing, Shen Rixin, Wang Yizhai, and over ten others, went to the Central Bank yesterday morning to petition. They were received by Deputy Director Li of the Business Bureau. The representatives unanimously requested that the exchange margin be paid according to the situation in various regions after the completion of the capital increase. They also requested that the Central Bank notify the local central banks not to refuse legal currency remittances before the specified deadline. Deputy Director Li said that the exchange margin has been approved to be paid half before the capital increase, and the remaining 50% will be collected after the capital increase. He will issue a circular to all branches to comply with the rule that legal currency remittances must not be refused after the November 20th deadline.

Request to Reduce the Amount of Capital Increase

In addition, the representatives from various regions will go to Nanjing tomorrow to petition the Ministry of Finance, requesting a reduction in the amount of capital increase and extending the deadline to six months, so that the cash portion of the capital increase will not be frozen, and the deposit interest rate will not be forcibly lowered. According to Qin Runqing, the capital increase standard is too high and cannot be borne by ordinary businesses, and there are also practical difficulties in merging operations. In terms of deposits, although the book value has increased, they are all floating and unstable, making it difficult to plan their use. Moreover, due to the current rush to purchase goods, deposits have decreased.

### Procedures for Reporting Student Records; Ministry of Education Order Prompting Relevant Matters for Junior College and Above Schools; Student Numbers as Data for Next Year's Budget

[From Our Correspondent in Nanjing on the 7th] The Ministry of Education issued an order on the 7th to all junior colleges and above, stating: The dates, procedures, and form formats for new students, transfer students, and graduates are detailed in the Student Record Regulations. The previously issued forms to be reported by affiliated agencies and schools also had additional regulations. On June 10th of this year, the Higher Education Department of the Ministry also issued a circular for printing. Now that the 1948 academic year has begun, the following matters related to the reporting of student records by schools are hereby re-emphasized: (1) The student number table for each department, subject, and group must be reported to the Ministry within ten days after the registration deadline of each semester. If there are any changes in the student number after reporting to the Ministry, a supplementary report can be made. When the Ministry compiles the budgets of various schools for the coming year, this type of report will be important data. (2) The name lists of new students, transfer students, graduate students, special students, and special students who have become regular students, since the 1948 academic year, should be written in ink in duplicate. After being reported to the Ministry for review, the original will be kept by the Ministry, and the duplicate will be returned to the original school for preservation to save procedures and speed up efficiency. (3) The name lists of new students, transfer students, graduate students, and special students should be reported to the Ministry within two months after the start of the semester, and the name list of graduates should be reported to the Ministry within three months after the graduation examination is completed. When reporting, the names of all new students (or graduates) in that semester should be listed in full. If the admission documents of new students are not complete, they can be reported in batches later to avoid hindering the early approval of the records of most students due to a few students whose documents are incomplete. When making a supplementary report, a name list should still be sent in duplicate, stating the year and numbering the name list according to the order of reporting to the Ministry (i.e., the first report to the Ministry is Name List No. 1, the second supplementary report is Name List No. 2, and so on) for easy reference. (4) Supplementary reports on the admission documents of new students or supplementary reports on the qualifications of graduates should be listed in separate volumes according to the year and reported as special cases. Also, the previous case number and the date of the Ministry's reply should be filled in detail. Students with the same academic year and semester should be compiled into one volume each month for reporting, and it is not advisable to report one document per student to save manpower and resources. (5) The size and items of each name list must comply with the regulations and be printed in accordance with the format attached to the letter issued by the Higher Education Department of the Ministry on June 10th of this year. (6) A reporting number should be compiled separately for the names of new students and graduates according to the year. When replying later, the original number should still be indicated in the name list. (7) The admission documents and photos of new students and transfer students should be separately bound into volumes, along with the statistical table and the name list of new students and transfer students, and reported together. The past academic results, photo albums, statistical tables, and graduation certificates of graduates should be reported together with the name list of graduates.

### Judicial Graduation Examination; Results Announced for the First Time Within Days

[From the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The qualification examination for the graduates of the law departments and judicial groups of various universities and independent colleges in 1948 was held on July 15th in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, and nineteen other locations.

In the first half, the Warrior team led by twenty-eight to twenty-four, a lead of two baskets. The game was extraordinarily thrilling, and the audience of over a thousand was in high spirits. During halftime, Miss Chen Meizhen, a representative of the Association, presented each team with a Ginza, a gift from Mr. Ji Zhizhong, a patron of sports, as a memento. Referees were Liu Hesheng and Xuan Zhijie.

Warrior Team Takes the Lead

The Warrior team is a rising force, initially fielding players such as Zhi Ji, Yongfang, Fuhai, Baokang, Zhang Pu, and Linzhen. The Mixed team, a joint force from the Hualian and Chenyou teams, initially fielded Fushen, Chengzhang, Zhenzhong, and Bingfu. The first half saw back-and-forth action, with the score differing by only one point at times, and ties occurring as many as four times, highlighting the tension of the game. Later, Zhenzhong of the Mixed team was substituted, and Jin Gu Jianjiang, Fu Jinsheng, entered the game. Xiangcheng took his place, and the battle became even more intense. The Warrior team gradually took the lead, with the first half ending at twenty-eight to twenty-four, the Warrior team ahead by two baskets.

One-Point Defeat

In the second half, after a break, the battle resumed, with the Chenyou players taking the lead. The Warrior team's momentum surged, with star player Cao Zhiji particularly active, driving straight into the opponent's territory. Fushen, Xiangcheng, and Jinsheng worked together, and the Warrior team led by as many as fifteen points, with a score of fifty-six to forty-three. However, the situation soon changed dramatically, and the Mixed team made a series of successful shots, staging a comeback. They ultimately won by a score of sixty-one to sixty, a reversal of fortune. It was a pity that the Warrior team could not hold onto their lead.

The Sports Reporters Association would like to express its deep gratitude to the Basketball Committee, the Gymnasium, the Hualian, Warrior, and Chenyou teams, as well as the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, the Xiexing Sports Equipment Factory, and the Siwei Boy Scouts for their enthusiastic support of this exhibition game.

### Résumé

— Mingxu

Just finished dinner, leaning back on the sofa chatting with my family, when my wife seemed to remember something. She suddenly got up, took a piece of paper from under the glass of her dresser, walked over, and told me:

"Mrs. Cheng just came by. She said that her eldest son, who just graduated from university this year, is looking for a job. She's begging you to help him out."

The piece of paper in her hand was naturally the résumé of that young Master Cheng. It was filled with pretentious, affected penmanship, which they say is called "flourishing style." But to us old-fashioned folks, it just looked like every character was leaning and tilting, like dancing the jitterbug.

"Okay, I'll see if there's an opportunity," I replied, casually placing the résumé on the tea table.

Honestly, I already felt a sense of dislike when I saw that handwriting. Even if there were a position opening up in my department, I wouldn't want to bring in someone like that. Official documents filled with tilted, illegible characters? What kind of system is that!

I took a puff of my cigarette and couldn't help blurting out:

"Is that kind of strange handwriting what university graduates write these days!"

My wife laughed. "I think most university students write like that now. Are universities supposed to force students to practice calligraphy?"

I thought about it. A few days ago, a friend who works at a certain national bank mentioned that his department was looking to hire someone who could draft documents, with beautiful and energetic handwriting. But after searching for several months, they had to settle for an old gentleman over sixty. They had also recruited university graduates several times, but none of them qualified.

Today, the disconnect between university education and reality is something everyone knows. People who study Western literature in university, finding work as English teachers in middle school seems to be using what they've learned. But before they become good teachers, they've probably already forgotten all the Chaucer, Milton, Molière, Schiller... etc., that they studied so diligently in university, and instead, they're picking up Nesfield's grammar again, memorizing those definitions and rules. People who graduate from Chinese literature programs and become secretaries in organizations are also considered to be "doing relevant work." But looking at the current university curriculum, they may have some research on the Songs of Chu or the Book of Changes, understanding a bit about the evolution of characters and sounds; however, if you ask them to handle a fairly complex document, there's an eighty or ninety percent chance they won't be able to figure it out. And if you ask them to manage archives, the task seems easy, but you still need a meticulous and quick mind to quickly categorize items. For example, the national bank I mentioned above is very large, but its archives are extremely disorganized. Sometimes, trying to find an old case from just half a month ago can take two or three days – or it might not be found at all. The bank authorities are well aware of this. They certainly want to rejuvenate the workforce and add some smart, capable, and energetic young people. But these skills are precisely what universities disdain to teach! So, those so-called "old hands" who exude a musty air become treasures in various organizations. The old practice of clerks monopolizing power has already become common today!

Is there a way to remedy this? Of course. The fundamental solution will have to wait until the world is at peace. It's nothing more than the government guaranteeing the lives of scholars, rewarding various academic research, etc., which is too far removed from what's possible in today's reality. We won't discuss it. If we're talking about a temporary solution that addresses the current situation, then I propose that universities have two sets of education, and must add some practical subjects.

For example, in the liberal arts college, in addition to the literature history, author studies, and masterpiece studies that are currently offered, the courses that must be added should include: (1) editing skills, (2) official document formats, (3) archive management, (4) writing skills (not the composition in freshman Chinese, but rather "penmanship"), (5) calligraphy and Chinese and English typing, (6) Mandarin, Cantonese, Shanghainese... etc. Those studying politics should also learn official document formats and archive management, as well as: (1) etiquette, striving for a good appearance, even if you're not good-looking, you must be generous and poised, with appropriate deportment, not sneaky, stingy, and annoying; (2) let's call it "officialdom studies" for now, such as how to handle official documents with appropriate weight, as well as how to handle expense reports and transfers of responsibilities, which have been discussed very heatedly recently; not to teach you how to cheat, but to let you know how to prevent others from cheating. In addition to having to learn factory management, science and engineering students must also learn how to deal with practical problems such as labor disputes. In addition, it's best for everyone to learn some teaching skills, to learn how to maintain classroom order, how to attract students' attention, etc., so that they can still teach when necessary. I'm not looking down on teaching at all, but I believe that teaching should be the job of graduates from normal universities, and ordinary university graduates should find other outlets.

Do you think I'm fantasizing? In fact, my suggestion is truly practical. Otherwise, look, right here on the tea table next to my sofa, there's another unlucky résumé...

### Inscription for a Painting of a Wild Goose by the Moon

— Zhang Buqu

At the edge of the sky, the frontier pass, the moon is three watches late; the cold geese call to their flock across ten thousand miles; the plan for the rice harvest is still undecided; the plants and trees of Jiangnan already echo the sounds of autumn!

### Feeling Intoxicated Frequently in Autumn

Day after day, the soldiers of wine attack the city of sorrow, but the drunkard will not allow his ten thousand thoughts to become empty; near the house, the departing swallows chirp to their nests; in the distant sky, the migrating swans shriek to avoid calamity; the western wind carries the withered leaves, fading to green, and the twilight flowers drip with broken red; the hundred-foot-high branches are lonely in autumn, and it is even harder to turn back to the northern window Paulownia.

### Gambling Game

— He Ku

Recently, at a friend's banquet, I saw a not-so-large-scale sand crab gambling game. Relying only on the secret of a single hidden card, everyone was focused and vying for the large stack of gold yuan notes in the center of the table. The seriousness of the situation could be seen in everyone's expressions. A hunched his shoulders, the muscles on his face lacking elasticity, his eyes constantly watching the "face cards" of others, carefully trying to figure them out. B had a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, the ash already accumulated to half an inch long, yet still not falling, constantly flipping his hidden card, wanting to make a desperate bet based on his own strength... When C pushed all the banknotes he had on him into the center of the table, the eyes of the others were all stunned, considering whether or not to raise him.

This is truly a reckless gamble. A group of gamblers around the round table, in that moment, mostly had the spirit of rushing through fire and water. No wonder Mr. D, who participated in the game, when he gave up the final showdown of that battle, said to the observing writer with a relaxed posture, gambling "crab" is like war, both need to understand "military strategy."

Gambling "crab" is like war, I think news reporters have long understood this meaning. Opening today's newspapers, you can often see the term "showdown" in the headline news, a term belonging to sand crab gambling. Examining the term "showdown," in Shanghai slang it's called "flipping sand crab," revealing all your skills and tricks. If you want to compete with him, you have to rely on your own strength to fight hard!

Looking at the current social situation, it seems that life is also engaged in a sand crab gambling game. Many people are converting gold yuan, obtained from gold, silver, and foreign currencies, into extravagant enjoyment. The larger ones buy houses and properties, the middling ones collect treasures and add clothing and decorations, and the smaller ones travel and enjoy themselves, lingering in sensual pleasures – it is said that the hotels in Hangzhou are fully booked this autumn, the reason being a vent for Shanghai stockbrokers as "hot money."

Everyone seems to be using "a sand game" to dispel the low-pressure season, indulging in enjoyment, holding the attitude of "drink today while you have wine today" to stake their lives on one throw of the dice. The magnitude of this gamble can be imagined.

Promoting diligence and frugality to correct extravagance is certainly the right medicine, the problem is how to turn people's hearts around and make them voluntarily tend towards the smooth current of frugality. This turning point should be "stability." Only with a stable life can people cherish things like gold, because now is no longer an era for empty slogans.

### A Note on the Painting "Dwelling in Qingbian"

— Peng Gusheng

During the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, Gan Province had two major collectors: Lü Dimannong (Xuegeng), known for collecting bronze inscriptions and paintings, and Miao Zhiting (Defen), known for collecting editions. Mannong was the esteemed father of Mr. Di Pingzi. He was a refined connoisseur and had a rich collection. The two paintings he most treasured in his life were the Album of Five Elders painted by a Song Dynasty artist, which later belonged to Sheng Xibo, and Wang Meng's "Dwelling in Qingbian." This painting uses dry brushstrokes for the mountains and thick ink for the trees, with a vivid and unrestrained spirit, purely following the style of Ju Ran. Its wildness and ruggedness surpass its origins. It has an inscription in running script by Dong Xiangguang: "The greatest Wang Shuming under heaven," and also records a poem by Ni Yunlin: "Wang Youjun's brush is refined and his ink is exquisite; he contemplates the Dao with a pure heart, following Zong Shaowen. The power of Wang Hou's brush can lift a tripod; for five hundred years, there has been no one like him." Such was the high regard that Ni and Dong had for him.

This painting was successively collected by the Zhenshangzhai and Tianlaige. Mannong obtained it while traveling as an official in Jiangxi and regarded it as a supreme treasure, unwilling to easily show it to others. At the time, a certain Wang, a high-ranking official in Gan Province, also had a passion for calligraphy and painting. He happened to see it during a visit and wanted to seize it by force. Di vowed to die rather than part with it, nearly reenacting the story of the Qingming Scroll. Fortunately, a certain Taoist intervened, and the Five Elders painting was given to Wang, resolving the matter. The Notes from the Pingdeng Pavilion once described its outline.

The Pingdeng Pavilion's collection of famous paintings numbered no fewer than one hundred and several dozen, but this painting alone was the most prized masterpiece. Pingzi cherished it as a priceless treasure during his lifetime. Even his close friend Wang Zizhan (i.e., Wang Kemin's father) requested to see it many times and was only granted one viewing. Japanese art lovers also coveted this painting and repeatedly offered large sums of money to buy it, but Pingzi remained unmoved, fortunately avoiding the continuation of the Four Treasures of Linchuan. Later, on the occasion of the Japanese Emperor's birthday, a member of the Japanese Imperial family invited Pingzi to Japan to appraise the bronze inscriptions and paintings in the Japanese palace collection, with an insurance of 600,000 gold. This painting was taken along for exhibition, showing how valuable it was. There are five copies, with the one copied by Runzhou Junshi, now belonging to Japan, being the best. The Youzheng Bookstore also has a photoprint, but it is difficult to purchase after the robbery.

### Pi Xiaoxue

The fashion of "no meat" is now very common. Reading what is published in this newspaper, I know that it is the same in Shanghai. Generally, this phenomenon is caused by price limits and shortages. There is universality, without regional differences. However, the pain of no meat in Beiping is different from elsewhere. This universality also has its particularity. Since the Stone Jin ceded the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun to the Khitans, and even when the Mongols established their capital, they were all dominated by nomadic tribes. Those above imitated what those above did, and those below followed like grass in the wind. Therefore, many street names in Beiping are "Mutton Alley," "Pig Market Entrance" (now changed to Pearl Market Entrance), Ox Blood Alley (now changed to Study Abroad Road), Horse Market Street, Mutton Horn Alley, Ox Tail Alley, Guima Market Street. There are countless streets and alleys with various names of oxen, sheep, pigs, and horses. You can still imagine the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties, with the city full of mutton and milk, reeking of meat and grease, and the gluttonous feast of the slaughterhouse, with meat at all times and in every meal. As for the modern Qing imperial family, there was even a grand ceremony of "eating meat." Ministers considered it a great honor to be rewarded with "eating meat in the palace." In the narration of the slow progress of officialdom and in the obituaries, this was listed together with the honors of "being rewarded with a palanquin" and "being rewarded with treasures." During the "meat eating," a large plate of meat was placed in front of the throne and in front of the desks of each minister, with knives and chopsticks provided. There were no other flavors. The ministers thanked the emperor for the reward and cut and ate the meat themselves. Some hung the leftover meat behind their palanquins when they left, as a way to boast. When the princes and ministers of each banner family encountered sacrifices or family celebrations, they also imitated the court, cooking large pigs and sheep with 　guests. Not attending or not eating much was disrespectful to the host. Han Chinese who had lived here for a long time also adopted the banner customs. For example, Ji Xiaolan (Yun) did not use rice or noodles in every meal, but only meat as the main food. The above are all found in Yao's "Bamboo Leaf Pavilion," Liang's "Return to Field Miscellany," and various notes.

The number of "meat" businesses and the types of names in the market and among the people are even more characteristic of the old capital. For example, those who specialize in "meat" include raw meat stalls in the vegetable market, sauce elbow shops (named 　elbow, but in fact, salty legs, sausages, and all parts of the pig's body, except the pig's head and tail, are prepared, and raw meat is also sold), sauce mutton shops, beef shops, or both beef and mutton are sold, but they are separated from pork shops as if by a gulf, called "separate religions." Those who sell both cooked products and raw meat are the same as sauce meat shops. There are rice shops that specialize in meat flavors for meals, such as the White Meat Restaurant in the west of the city (i.e., Shaguoju, which uses all parts of the whole pig's body to make various styles, without vegetables and other flavors) and mutton restaurants. (Such as Xilaishun, Yimuyuan, Zhengyanglou, Roasted Meat Chen, etc., countless, specializing in various flavors of mutton, with various cooking and preparation methods.) There are also small shops and stalls that specialize in selling roasted mutton, sauce mutton, and beef, and there are stalls that specialize in selling pork head meat, mutton head meat, pig intestines (named fried liver), mutton intestines (named frost intestines), sheep tripe (named burst belly), and beef tendons and lamb offal. Each carries a small basket and sells them in various markets or along the alleys, until late at night. At this time of high autumn, with the north wind gradually strengthening, until winter, it is the time when the stove fire is burning brightly and the fragrance of meat is overflowing. In the food shops that come from the south, such as Fujian's meat floss shops, Guangdong's preserved meat and sausage shops, as well as chicken and duck shops, they are all based on "meat" as their business, without meat there is no business. Without these industries, most of the city's prosperity is lost.

Meat is still essential in places that do not specialize in selling "meat products," such as Chinese and Western restaurants, southern-flavored shops (like "Daoxiang"), and savory food shops (wonton, dumplings, meat pies, etc.). How can they do without meat for a day? However, since the middle of last month, the city's meat has gone from shortage to extinction. Raw meat, cooked meat, and meat products have caused great panic. Some stopped selling on the door, and some temporarily changed industries (such as stalls selling meat changed to fried tofu). The market was unusually desolate. By the last sentence of September, it gradually became active again. Except for raw meat shops, which were still empty and cold, cooked meat and meat-based food shops and stalls suddenly filled with goods. The meat in Chinese and Western restaurants was also endless, saying it was bought directly from the slaughterhouse, but isn't it still a black market? They buy at high prices and sell at high prices. There are many types and miscellaneous styles. "August 19th" is what standard? There is no way to check it clearly. Moreover, cooked meat has different seasonings and preparation methods, which can be worded, and there is plenty of room for flexibility.

However, the raw meat stalls in the vegetable market, whether beef, mutton, or pork, are still empty. As a result, housewives and cooks have no way to buy meat, cook dishes, or make buns and wontons. Those who want to get a meat 　 can only go to the shop to buy sauce meat, smoked meat, and buy sausages, pig's head meat, and mutton head meat from small stalls or sellers. There are still a few sellers of raw mutton, but pork is absolutely unavailable without acquaintances.
