The Problem of the Representatives from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties is Resolved; The Youth Party Declares its Decision to Participate in the Assembly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The problem of the representatives from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties was resolved on the 28th. They collectively went to register at about 10:00 PM on the 28th. Chairman Chiang summoned key members of the two parties, Xu Chuanbi, Yang Qiqiao, Jiang Yuntian, Yu Jiaju, Liu Dongyan, etc., on the morning of the 28th to inform them again of the decision to yield to friendly parties.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The spokesperson of the Chinese Youth Party issued the following statement on the 28th regarding participation in the first National Assembly: The Chinese Youth Party has been striving for democratic constitutionalism for more than 20 years. It completed the great task of constitutionalism based on its long-held aspirations. Subsequently, to prepare for the implementation of constitutionalism, it participated in the government. Now, on the eve of the convening of the National Assembly, to assist in the implementation of constitutionalism, realize democracy, and complete the great task of national construction, the participation of our party in the National Assembly is only natural. As for the supplementary regulations on party nominations by the State Council and the agreements between parties that our party has insisted on, Chairman Chiang has solemnly announced their implementation. Therefore, our party has resolutely decided to participate in the National Assembly to assist in this grand event.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] After Chairman Chiang issued a sternly worded statement, the spokesperson of the Democratic Socialist Party stated on the 28th that the party considered Chairman Chiang's decision "very reasonable and excellent" and expressed complete satisfaction with it.

### The Problem of the Representatives from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties is Resolved; The Youth Party Declares its Decision to Participate in the Assembly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] On the eve of the convocation of the National Assembly, the National Political Council, which has participated in politics for ten years, officially announced its dissolution on the 28th in accordance with the law. Reviewing the glorious history of the past ten years, the councilors celebrated the completion of their great responsibility, and at the same time, were reluctant to part after ten years of gathering. They solemnly held a closing tea party and invited Chairman Chiang to attend and give instructions. The past councilors, especially those who believed that although the Council had ended, their own responsibility to the country had not disappeared, formed a Liaison Association of Past Councilors to continue to strive for the completion of democratic politics with ten years of experience. The Liaison Association was officially established on the morning of the 28th, issued a declaration, and elected Mo Dehui and 50 others as directors, and Hu Shi and 30 others as supervisors.

The closing tea party was held on the afternoon of the 28th. More than a hundred past councilors attended. Government officials who participated included Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Wang Yunwu, Bao Erhan, Wang Shijie, Yu Hongjun, Zhu Jiahao, Xu Shiying, Xue Dubi, Hang Liwu, Xu Baiyuan, Xie Guansheng, and Li Weiguo. Zhang Boling, Mo Dehui, Wu Yifang, Jiang Yong, and others from the Presidium of the Political Council also attended. Chairman Chiang arrived at the venue at 3:55 PM, dressed in military uniform, looking radiant.

Zhang Boling, in his capacity as interim chairman, delivered a speech, first comparing the work of the Council over the past ten years to "pulling a boat". The work of pulling a boat requires everyone to unite and concentrate their strength in order to reach the destination smoothly. Fortunately, the ten years of work of the Council have enabled it to steer this boat to its destination fairly and squarely, without encountering the danger of reefs. Recalling that at the tea party at Chairman Chiang's official residence at the beginning of its establishment ten years ago, he delivered a speech with "knowing the difficulty and knowing the danger" as encouragement, which is still applicable today.

Mo Dehui, in his closing speech, cited three things to show the prestige of the Political Council: (1) Supporting the War of Resistance and National Construction, (2) Assisting the Government in Construction, (3) Promoting Democratic Constitutionalism. At the end, he declared: Supporting Chairman Chiang as the first President of the Republic, which was unanimously and enthusiastically applauded. Chairman Chiang was then invited to deliver instructions. The Chairman looked radiant and smiled as he spoke (the original speech is below). The whole venue expressed their support with applause.

In his reply speech, Zhang Boling expressed that he would invigorate his spirit and work hard, and the future would surely be bright.

Finally, Councilor Su Ting specially raised the importance of local self-defense forces, hoping that the central government could allocate 100,000 guns to form ten self-defense regiments. In addition, some people also suggested that the suppression of the Communists should be coordinated with military affairs politically, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and reform the land system. The meeting concluded satisfactorily at 5:00 PM.

### Minister Bai Returns to Nanjing

Optimistic About the Battle Situation in the Dabie Mountains

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, who flew to Wuhan to inspect the situation a few days ago, flew back to the capital after completing his official business on the afternoon of the 28th. The reporter specially visited him to inquire about the battle situation in the Dabie Mountain area. He stated: The bandit area in the Dabie Mountains has now entered the stage of clearing out scattered bandits. The main force of the Communist bandits has been completely defeated. The Communist bandits have lost face-to-face control of various counties, townships, and towns. The National Army is developing political organizations under military cover. Therefore, the baojia system in various counties, townships, and towns has now been established. The Communist bandits have no source of food, cannot conscript young men, and are finding it more difficult to gather intelligence. It is estimated that since the establishment of the Jiujiang Forward Command on October 27th of last year, a period of four months, the various tasks originally planned have been largely completed. Currently, if the military and political sectors can fully cooperate, there should be no problem in suppressing bandits in the Dabie Mountain area. Bai's conversation was full of confidence, showing optimism about the battle situation.

### Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Instructions: The Government Must Be Responsible for Eliminating the Bandit Disaster, With Firm Confidence to Overcome Difficulties

The full text of Chairman Chiang's address at the closing tea party of the National Political Council is as follows:

The National Political Council has been established for ten years. During these ten years, all colleagues have united and assisted the government to complete the mission of the War of Resistance, which is an immortal contribution of this council to the nation, and one that I will always remember. Now, on the occasion of the end of this council, I personally recall that the government made a decision ten years ago that I still regret, that is, the error in judgment regarding the Communist Party. The government at that time believed that the Communist Party, in the face of national righteousness, would abandon its conspiracy to overthrow the government and undermine unity, and would work together with compatriots across the country to strive for the great cause of the War of Resistance and national construction. Therefore, it allowed them to participate in this council. Unexpectedly, this erroneous decision led to today's evil consequences. Now, the Communist bandits have openly rebelled, making it impossible to recover national territory, and the suffering of the people is deepening day by day. This is the responsibility that the government should bear. However, the government must be responsible to the end, thoroughly eliminate the bandit disaster, save the people, recover the lost land, and ensure the unity and independence of our country.

Now, some people believe that the current situation of the country is more serious than the initial stage of the War of Resistance. This is actually a superficial view. When we observe the safety and danger of the country and nation, we must see the greater picture and look far ahead.

### Chairman Chiang's Letter to the Youth of the Nation: Encouraging Them to Recognize the National Crisis and Their Own Responsibilities, To Eradicate Obstacles to the Revolution, and To Lay the Foundation for the Nation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The 29th is the anniversary of the Huanghuagang Uprising, also the 5th Youth Day. Chairman Chiang specially wrote a letter to the youth of the nation, the full text of which is as follows:

Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, and also our fifth Youth Day. It is also the beginning of our democratic constitutionalism. This triple festival has its great significance. Our youth of the nation must commemorate the deeds of the martyrs, inherit the cause of the martyrs, so as not to be unworthy of being outstanding youth who carry on the past and open up the future for our Chinese nation.

The purpose of our national revolution for fifty years has been to save the country from peril, and to establish our Republic of China as an independent, free, unified and democratic new country. The Battle of Huanghuagang manifested the sacrificial spirit of revolutionary youth who devoted themselves to the country with the utmost integrity and awakened the national consciousness of the general society at that time which was on the verge of extinction. The success of the Xinhai Revolution, the completion of the Northern Expedition, and the achievements of the youth joining the army movement during the War of Resistance all inherited this glorious tradition. Now, it has been more than two years since we won the War of Resistance. At the beginning of the victory, due to the Communist Party's obstruction of the surrender and demobilization, and its insistence on armed separatism and undermining national unity, our China lost the golden opportunity for post-war national construction. In order to seek peaceful construction, the government did not hesitate to make repeated concessions, while the Communist bandits used the opportunity of negotiations and mediation to expand their occupied territories and rebel forces. Finally, they revealed their disguised masks, implemented a full-scale rebellion, and did not hesitate to destroy the country, ruin the nation, damage the social economy, and endanger the people's livelihood. Wherever the Communist bandits roamed, production and transportation were completely destroyed, and food and materials were plundered. The people in the bandit areas suffered inhuman trampling and slaughter. The compatriots in the rear also suffered the bitterness of poverty and cold. Our nation has reached a critical period of life and death. In order to preserve the glory of independence and freedom sacrificed by our revolutionary martyrs and the army and people during the War of Resistance, we must inherit their cause and fight to the death to complete the great task of saving the country. Youth is the rising life of the country. First of all, I want to awaken the youth of the nation to recognize the national crisis, recognize their own responsibilities, rise up in time to eradicate the greatest obstacles to our revolution and national construction, lay the foundation for our country's independence and freedom, and guarantee the realization of our democratic constitutionalism and the Three Principles of the People.

The youth of the nation must know that our eight-year War of Resistance in the past was to ensure the independent survival of the country, restore the integrity of territorial sovereignty, and seek the completion of economic construction and democratic constitutionalism. But all these prerequisites are based on national unity. Any national independence movement or national renaissance movement in the world must also be a national unification movement. Only when the country is unified can the nation ensure its independence. Take the United States as an example. The American founding movement began with the War of Independence in 1775, but the foundation of the American state was laid more than seventy years later, when President Lincoln defeated the Southern secession movement in the Civil War, and then the long-term peace and stability of the country was ensured. From this, we can see that the work of national construction cannot be accomplished overnight, and the cause of unification must go through a long struggle to quell the rebellion before it can succeed from hardship and pain. If the country is not unified, it cannot maintain an independent and equal status. If the country is not unified, it cannot guarantee the people's freedom to promote democratic constitutionalism. If the country is not unified, it cannot carry out economic construction to improve people's lives. The difficulties our country is facing today and the suffering the people are enduring are all caused by the Communist bandits' rebellion. If the Communist bandits are not wiped out for a day, the country cannot be unified for a day. Not only will the people's hardships be impossible to alleviate, the economic crisis will be impossible to save, but the independent survival of the entire nation will not be guaranteed, and finally it will inevitably tend to complete destruction. Looking at the spread of the Communist bandits' rebellion and the expansion of their conspiracy in the past year, it is obvious that their ultimate goal is to reduce our China to a vassal and trap our compatriots into slavery, and then use our Chinese territory, people and all material resources as tools to endanger world peace. Understanding this meaning, we can know why our country, when its vitality had not recovered from eight years of hard fighting, had to endure the pain and engage in mobilization to quell the rebellion. We can also know that mobilization to quell the rebellion is the inescapable responsibility of all patriotic compatriots and patriotic youth in China.

Our revolutionary and national construction cause has encountered countless setbacks, shocks, and difficulties. From Yuan Shikai's imperial system, Zhang Xun's restoration, the warlord separatism to the Japanese imperialist aggression, all were destroyed by our national spirit and the revolutionary forces of the Three Principles of the People. The Communist bandits' rebellion today is inheriting all the clothes of the counter-revolutionaries, and gathers the great achievements of bandits, traitors, reactionary warlords, and imperialist aggressive forces. This kind of domestic turmoil with international ties can be said to be the biggest difficulty encountered since the revolution. It can also be said that today is always the final decisive battle between the national revolution and the counter-revolutionary forces. Only the victory of this decisive battle can consolidate national unity, ensure national independence, complete political democracy, carry out economic construction, and give full play to the spirit of the Chinese nation's love of peace, independence, and self-determination, and eliminate the threats to world peace and human security. I personally joined the Tongmenghui at the age of twenty-two, followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the revolution, and this year marks forty years. I feel that this is really the most dangerous and serious battle for life and death since our revolution. But with my forty years of experience in participating in the revolution, I can assert that the victory of this suppression of the rebellion will be more great and meaningful than the gains of any previous revolutionary war. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Anything that conforms to the principles of heaven, responds to the hearts of the people, and is in line with the world trend will not fail." If our compatriots throughout the country can uphold the consistent spirit of the War of Resistance, recognize righteousness, must be able to defeat violence, the truth that human nature must overcome bestiality, unite as one, cooperate unanimously, share weal and woe, and strive hard, then today's final difficulty is the foundation for the final success in the near future. Whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, any bandit or rebel who goes against the principles of heaven and violates the trend of the times will never be eliminated, and the obstacles to revolutionary nation-building and democratic freedom will never be removed. Youth are entrusted with the destiny of the country. As long as the youth of the nation establish the ambition to serve the country, enrich the cultivation of serving the country, understand what is right and wrong, distinguish between obedience and rebellion, give full play to the spirit of struggle, and shoulder the mission of the times, then the future of the country will always be bright, and the cause of the national revolution will inevitably be successful. Today, I want to solemnly encourage the patriotic and ambitious youth of the nation with the following points: (Continued on the left corner of the second page)

### Mo Dehui's Campaign Strength

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] In the lineup of candidates for Vice President, Mr. Mo Dehui is undoubtedly a unique banner. He is not an official with real power, nor does he possess a vast array of military commanders. He is simply a non-partisan person without an organization. So, what does he rely on to campaign? In fact, when it comes to it, he has not decided to participate in the campaign. When the Northeastern people in Beijing had already organized a campaign support association for him, the reporter visited him, and he said with a trembling voice: "How can I have the heart to campaign for any Vice President? My home is broken, how can I talk about campaigning?" Old Liu is truly a compassionate person. When this is almost a world of people eating people, he still feels the pain of the country's destruction and the family's death with a compassionate heart. This kindness of his especially shows that it is not only because he was born in Jilin, but more because of "sympathy." However, precisely because of this, the Northeastern people are all spontaneously supporting him and repeatedly urging him to participate in the campaign. Indeed, it was under the circumstances of "overwhelming kindness" that he began to reveal the news that he had agreed to participate in the campaign.

He is a well-known social sage. In the National Political Council, he is always like a moderate who specializes in buffering. In the Kuomintang-Communist Party's several compromises from cooperation to division and from division to cooperation, which time was there no running around by Old Liu! However, he wants to criticize corrupt officials and report inferior governance; he is not a true moderate. It's just that his moderation is towards people, while he must seek truth from facts on matters.

In the hearts of the Northeastern people, he has deeply planted roots, and they will always remember Old Liu. In the past two years, Northeastern condolences, consolation, and relief, fundraising, almost every time he leads, as long as he raises his arms and calls, there is nothing that cannot be done. However, saying this is only in terms of emotion. In fact, what he has done for the Northeastern people is equivalent to connecting the central government and the Northeastern local government. Without his mediation, who among the Northeastern people would not say: "The central government has completely forgotten us!" Who would not say: "The government has decided to abandon the Northeast"! Therefore, some people believe that Old Liu is almost equal to the central government's political power over the overall situation in the Northeast. Now, the President has been unanimously supported by everyone as Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang is a Southerner. If the Vice President is also a Southerner, I am afraid that the hearts of the Northerners will cool down, and the central government's politics is still so biased! Still using this kind of biased policy"! Therefore, if Mr. Mo can be appointed as Vice President, it will give the Northeastern people some comfort.

He is unique in this campaign camp, but he will never use any opportunity to rape public opinion. He wants to politely let people vote for him willingly. But he obviously does not have an organized "army." Is it hard to say that he doesn't even have a little strength? Wrong, an observer on the sidelines said to me: "He is non-partisan, so some people in the National Political Council will support him. He is a Northerner, so people from the 29 provinces and cities in North China and the 9 provinces and 3 cities in the Northeast will undoubtedly support him. He is not a member of the Kuomintang, especially since he is the mediator who compromises with various parties, so if the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party do not nominate their own candidates, they will definitely support him. There is another not small force, and that is Catholicism." In this way, Mo Dehui's campaign strength is quite large.

### National Army Meets Between Jinzhou and Yixian; Shenyang Residents Migrate on Foot into the Pass

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th] The National Army between Jinzhou and Yixian met on the 27th at Qilihezi, 25 kilometers north of Jinzhou. The air force cooperated to clear out the remaining bandits. The scattered bandits on both sides of the Panan Taizi River have been suppressed, and all ferry crossings are completely under the control of the National Army, which is stabilizing the refugees. The air force is active, bombing cities and towns along the Pingmei Line for days, and the bandit army's supply and transportation have been severely hit.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th] For days, about five or six hundred residents have been traveling on foot from Suizhong to Jinzhou and then into the Pass. They carry small bags with them, and it takes about seven days to reach. They have become an endless stream of migrants. Those who can take a long-term view will find that today's national situation is far better than the initial stage of the War of Resistance. Recalling the first meeting of this council in Wuhan, at that time the capital was still under enemy occupation, and there was no definite certainty about the military, political, and diplomatic situation. What we relied on to fight was only our sincere dedication to the country and the people and our confidence in the country and the nation. Today, however, the foundation of the country has been soundly established by the efforts of all colleagues in the past ten years. If we have firm confidence, there is no danger for the future of the country and the nation, and all difficulties can be overcome. Now that this council has ended, your responsibilities to the country and the nation still exist. Therefore, I hope that you will still maintain the determination to go to the country's difficulties together ten years ago, continue the efforts of the past ten years as one day, assist the government, share weal and woe, and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's report criticizing the Chinese government was revoked on the 27th by Senate President Vandenberg. He stated that the report was an error in judgment, for which he should bear full responsibility in the first place for issuing it. Subsequently, he expressed regret over the matter. The report, which condemned the Chinese government's incompetence and corruption, was released simultaneously with the committee's approval of a $463 million aid package to China on the 26th. Vandenberg stated that the report was not reviewed by the committee or himself, and it does not represent the opinions of all thirteen members of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is the chairman.

### Editorial: Taking the First Step Towards Democratic Constitutionalism

—— Commemorating Revolutionary Martyrs and Celebrating the 5th Youth Day

Today is the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs, as well as the 5th Youth Day. The first National Assembly under the Constitution will also open today in the capital, further emphasizing the significance of commemorating the Revolutionary Martyrs and celebrating Youth Day. The fundamental task of this National Assembly is to exercise the powers vested in it by the Constitution, to complete the organization of a democratically elected government, thereby ending the one-party responsible system, and to allow all peaceful and legitimate political parties in the country to share political responsibility according to the path prescribed by the Constitution. Therefore, today marks the first step for our country to steadily embark on democratic constitutionalism; it is also a major key to our country's peace, unity, democracy, and strength. As we remember the heroic sacrifices of the revolutionary martyrs of the past, face the various crises we face today, and look forward to the future of our nation, we cannot but place all our hopes entirely on the youth of today, and further hope that the Constitutional National Assembly convened this time can lay a solid foundation for our country's democratic constitutionalism.

Recalling the revolutionary movements before the founding of the Republic of China, we do not know how many acts of righteousness were undertaken, with predecessors falling and successors continuing, without knowing how much blood was shed, nor how many heads were lost! Everyone knows that these are glorious historical records written in blood by our Chinese revolutionary youth: whether it is collective action or individual acts of "killing oneself to achieve benevolence" or "sacrificing oneself to take righteousness," they are all tearful; especially on this day thirty-seven years ago, the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang made a heroic sacrifice, which was truly enough to move heaven and earth and weep ghosts and gods. Although this revolutionary movement failed, the blood of the seventy-two martyrs was not shed in vain. Their great spirit of sacrifice not only awakened the sleeping national soul, but also gave the Chinese people a great spiritual appeal, laying the foundation for the success of the revolution. Therefore, our country's revolutionary movement, from beginning to end, has been built on the shoulders of revolutionary youth.

From the sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang to today, thirty-seven years have passed. During this period, relying on the blood and heads of the martyrs, although we overthrew the corrupt and autocratic Qing Dynasty, although we eliminated the warlords who were constantly engaged in civil war, although we defeated the invading Japanese imperialism and abolished all unequal treaties, we are still far from the ultimate goal of the National Revolution. Nationalism has not yet been thoroughly completed, democracy has just begun, and the People's Livelihood has not yet been realized; moreover, our country's founding and revitalization are still full of obstacles and thorns. Today, as we commemorate the martyrs, celebrate Youth Day, and open the first Constitutional National Assembly, all of us should face reality, deeply reflect, and seek a thorough awakening of the entire country, and quickly seek a major plan for innovation and renewal.

First, the most important task of the government today is to suppress the rebellion and build the country, and the only basic task of the future democratically elected government is also to quell the rebellion and build the country: and if the source of chaos spread by the communist bandits in the country cannot be suppressed and eradicated, then the work of nation-building cannot be carried out. But how can we quell the rebellion without causing it to become more chaotic? President Chiang issued a statement on the 27th stating: "Today's national situation is extremely serious: the poisonous flames of the communist bandits are so rampant. Only by jointly maintaining the dignity of the Constitution and establishing the foundation of democratic politics by all patriots and people with lofty ideals in the country, and only by jointly following the path of party politics, mutually understanding and cooperating, establishing a constitutional government, abiding by the Constitution, and assuming the heavy responsibility of guaranteeing the freedom of the people, implementing basic national policies, and maintaining national territorial sovereignty, can we overcome difficulties and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country." From President Chiang's edict, it can also be seen that political democratization is the only broad road for our country to quell the rebellion and build the country. At present, the political "corruption and incompetence" of our country, manipulated by "powerful families" and "bureaucrats," has become an undeniable fact, and everyone is aware of the need for thorough reform. According to the methods of democratic countries, the steps to reform politics; first, open up speech, widely solicit public opinion, and the government should take public opinion as its basis for all domestic and foreign measures; second, expand the foundation of democracy, recruit domestic talents, and implement the supreme principle of "using people according to their talents" in both the central government and local governments, and thoroughly eliminate bureaucratic politics; third, institutionalize the administrative system, not only implement hierarchical responsibility, but also establish a civil service system to improve administrative efficiency. Everyone knows that suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion is 30% military and 70% political, and the thorough reform of politics is a necessary condition for completing the suppression of the rebellion. I hope that after the closing of this National Assembly and the establishment of a democratically elected government, we can make drastic reforms in politics, renew our faces, and start afresh with the people.

Second, to quell the rebellion, we must first study the origin of the chaos. The surge in the communist bandits' arrogance is certainly due to the government's mistake in seeking peace at the beginning of the victory, missing the opportunity, and allowing the communist bandits to expand their power and territory. However, it has been almost a year since the government explicitly ordered the suppression of the rebellion, but the strength of the communist bandits has not weakened, and the area in which they are creating chaos has expanded. At present, there is a phenomenon in the country of quelling the rebellion but becoming more and more chaotic, and the key to this is worth our attention. Today, China seems to be suffering from a body of problems. We must not "avoid treatment for fear of disease," but should concentrate on diagnosis to investigate the source of the disease? Then, we can prescribe medicine according to the symptoms. According to our deep reflection, in addition to political corruption and incompetence, the most important factor in creating the current serious situation is that although the Kuomintang government believes in the Three People's Principles of the Founding Father, it only knows how to sit and talk, but does not know how to take action. In particular, the People's Livelihood of the Founding Father has methods for regulating capital for the economic control of the capital, and has proposals for equalizing land rights for rural society to achieve the ideal of "farmers have their land." These economic reform plans that are beneficial to national needs and people's livelihoods have not been effectively implemented, but have been stolen by the communist bandits, who use "small capitalism" and "land reform" as slogans. Not to mention that ordinary ignorant farmers will blindly follow, even foreign reporters mistakenly believe that the communist bandits are a political party that advocates "land reform." This misstep of the Kuomintang cannot be denied, and it cannot but be deeply reflected upon. For the current plan, we can only catch up quickly, make a painful determination, and immediately implement the People's Livelihood of the Founding Father to relieve the suffering of the majority of the people. All parts of the country, whether in the buffer zone or in the rear, or even in the Jinghu District, have reached the stage of "people's livelihood is difficult." The stabilization and improvement of people's livelihood is already urgent. Fortunately, "hungry people are easy to feed, and thirsty people are easy to drink." As long as the government can make a painful determination and implement the People's Livelihood regardless of all obstacles, it is very easy to see results.

Third, suppressing the rebellion and building the country requires the efforts of the government, but it is also difficult to succeed without the assistance of the people. Everyone knows that China is an agricultural society, and most of the people have no knowledge; they do not know what politics is at all, and even if their lives are painful, they do not know how to express their opinions on national affairs. Therefore, China's democratic politics is very different from the situation in other countries. At present, our country needs selfless knowledge and youth, who can understand the sufferings of the majority of the people, think for them, and speak for them. On the one hand, they can express public opinion as the basis for the government's policies, and on the other hand, they can unite into a force to urge the government to innovate and progress, so that government officials can truly become servants of the people. Therefore, we look forward to the establishment of the government elected in accordance with the Constitution after the opening of this National Assembly. On the one hand, we wish the National Assembly success, and on the other hand, we hope that the knowledge and youth of the whole country will stand up, review national affairs, observe the people's conditions, speak for the people, and urge the government to thoroughly reform and implement the democratization of politics and the socialization of the economy, and complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country as soon as possible!

### Taiwan Delegates Will Request Reduction in Taxes Related to Cultural and Educational Undertakings

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Taiwan Province delegates Lin Zigui and others are planning to ask the government to reduce or exempt taxes related to education and cultural undertakings, popularize social education, and improve the people's intelligence, in order to benefit the Constitution and promote revival. Taking advantage of their visit to Nanjing to attend the meeting, they will ask delegates from various regions to co-sign the proposal and submit it to the government for review and implementation. The proposal explains that the first priority for revival and construction and the implementation of self-government should be to improve the people's intelligence and popularize social education. However, in the current various tax laws, educational and cultural undertakings such as movies, dramas, publications, bookstores, book fairs, singing venues, ballrooms, and skating rinks are all regarded as profit-making businesses and are subject to business tax, banquet and entertainment tax, stamp tax, etc., and many are taxed at a higher rate than general businesses. The tax rate for the materials needed for the newspaper industry is also the same as other industries and should also be reasonably adjusted. The measures are: (1) Theater groups, performing troupes, or song and dance visiting groups that are purely for publicity and educational purposes or contain local cultural exchange significance should be exempt from various taxes. (2) Entertainment businesses with educational properties, such as movie theaters, theaters, and film merchants, should reduce various taxes to the lowest amount. (3) Bookstores and publishing industries should also be reduced or exempted from taxes. (4) The mailing fees for newspapers and the paper fees for news telegrams and telephones should be reduced to the lowest limit. Newspapers, inks, etc. should be universally allocated by the government and distributed fairly by the county or province to the Executive Yuan and the competent authorities on a regular basis.

### Improving Kaohsiung Oil Refinery: Expanding Machinery and Equipment

Plant Manager Talks Upon Returning from Inspection in Iran

[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 28th] Bin Guo, the manager of the Kaohsiung Refinery, was sent to Iran for inspection and has recently returned to Kaohsiung. According to his remarks, the Iranian refinery is currently the largest refinery in the world. The British began developing Iran in 1901 and discovered rich oil fields in 1908. The following year, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was established and began refining oil. It was renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1935. The refining business developed year by year. Last year, crude oil production reached 21 million tons, and 400,000 barrels of gasoline were refined daily. The purpose of his inspection was to find ways to improve the Kaohsiung Refinery. The plant is currently continuously supplementing a large number of machines recently shipped from the United States. Currently, it can refine 15,000 barrels of oil per day. After the new equipment is completed, the refining capacity can be increased to 50,000 barrels. The biggest problem for the plant is the unsmooth transportation of crude oil. After the expiration of the contract for 300,000 tons of crude oil signed by the Resources Commission and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company of Iran last year, this year the contract has been changed to Texaco of Arabia, and the China Oil Tanker Company's Yonghong and Yongze vessels are responsible for transportation, but only 10,000 tons of crude oil enter the port each month, which is only enough for the plant to refine for ten days. The Yonghao, a 10,000-ton oil tanker under repair at Kaohsiung Port, will also participate in transportation in a few months. As for some technical issues, some personnel withdrawn from the Jinxi Refinery in Northeast China may be sent to Kaohsiung to assist.

### Chairman's Letter to the Nation's Youth

Deliberate and Discern: Recognize the Enemies of the Nation

(Continued from Page 1) First, young people should deliberate and discern, and recognize the enemies of the nation. Young people should have ardent emotions, and at the same time, they should have rich intellect. Today, the reasons for young people's sadness, anger, and vexation are certainly not just one. Some are vexed by the country's many disasters, some are vexed by economic imbalances, some are vexed by unreasonable politics, and some are vexed by social evils and personal futures. In fact, our most urgent task at present is to eliminate the Communist bandits and eliminate the Communist bandits. Because the Communist bandits are the biggest obstacle to the country's revival, disrupting social order, cutting off people's livelihoods, and hindering political reforms. If the Communist bandits are not eliminated for a day, young people will not have a bright future for a day. The Communist bandits are the enemies of the country, and they are also the enemies of your young people. The Communist bandits and the tools of the Communist bandits use you, deceive you, and ruin you. All kinds of tricks were also deeply expressed in various student movements last year. Who caused your difficult life? Who provoked your youthful emotions? Who coerced you not to have the freedom to express your opinions and personal actions? Who ruined your good time and destroyed your learning environment? I think you should have a clear judgment. The so-called "professional students," who do not attend classes all year round, never graduate, mix into your ranks, steal your name, confuse your vision, force your actions, and disrupt your order, you should have a clear understanding of them. My patriotic youth, how does the country nurture you, how does society expect you, but the Communist bandits do not recognize that you have independent personalities, but treat you as objects, not as people, and want to use you as their tools to betray the country and harm the people. This is an intolerable insult. If you ignore the crimes of the Communist bandits and tolerate the existence of the Communist bandits, that is a stain on the glorious history of the revolutionary youth of China. Therefore, I call on you to deliberate and discern, and recognize that the Communist bandits are your own enemies. For the sake of the country, for the sake of the compatriots who have been harmed, you should support the , eradicate the Communist , in order to maintain your purity, wash away your shame, and show your courage as young people, you should unite and rise up to eliminate the Communist bandits in your ranks.

Work Hard and Diligently: Strive for Academic Progress

Second, young people must work hard and diligently and strive for academic progress. For China to stand in modern international society, it must complete various constructions and seek upward progress in academic culture. Now is the era of science. Science has changed nature and science has increased human welfare. Since this war, the relationship between science and human destiny has been even more significant. However, the development of science comes from continuous research, bit by bit, and can never be achieved overnight. For the past ten years, amidst the hardships of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the work of academic research has still achieved considerable results, which cannot but be attributed to the efforts of the academic community. However, if we want to develop industries, complete construction, and enrich the national economy and people's livelihood, not only is the level of scientific research too low, but the quantity is also too small. The youth of our country must have the determination to catch up, work diligently and diligently, and not be distracted. In the classroom, in the laboratory, in the library, in the factory, concentrate on the research of science and the improvement of technology , no matter how difficult it is, we must always work hard and not , catch up with the times, and seek progress. This is the great responsibility of benefiting the country and the people. I hope that ambitious young people will take it on resolutely.

Abide by the Law and Respect Discipline: Establish a Democratic Model

Third, young people must abide by the law and respect discipline and establish a democratic model. Our country has now entered the stage of democratic constitutionalism. The concrete realization of democracy does not only rely on a set of systems or forms. The main thing is that the whole country can have the habit of the rule of law, understand the distinction of freedom, and from the government to the society, everyone abides by the law, everything abides by the law, so that perfect constitutionalism can be achieved, and the people of the whole country can receive real welfare. The youth of our country are the vanguard leading reforms and the future backbone of the country. They should have the spirit of abiding by the law and respecting discipline and the democratic demeanor of respecting the freedom of others. What was manifested in the student movements of last year was that schools were more chaotic than society. Many Communist bandits and young people who were willing to be directed by others regarded themselves as a special class, outside the laws and disciplines of the country. Teachers can be insulted, school rules can be broken, students can be coerced, and even the freedom of others and other schools can be interfered with. This phenomenon almost wants to pull China, which is advancing to the democratic avenue in the 20th century, back to the original society, the era of exclusive violence. It is really not suitable for modern Chinese youth. I sincerely hope that my young people will reflect on their sacred responsibility to the country and the nation, correct their views, reform their lives, respect reason, respect order, and establish a neat school spirit, so that social customs can be changed, and true democracy can be realized.

Face Reality: Inherit the Spirit of the Martyrs

Youths of the country, now our country and people are facing a great test again. Whether our country can be independent and self-sufficient, whether our nation can prosper, depends on whether we can unite the power of patriotic people across the country, whether we can eliminate obstacles to unified nation-building, whether we can eliminate the rebellion of the Communist bandits, and whether we can implement the Three Principles of the People, the principles of our country. According to past history, whenever the beliefs of young people are consistent, their actions are consistent, their will is concentrated, and their strength is concentrated, it is when our country overcomes difficulties and opens up to light. As long as we can inherit the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country, understand the great significance of the Youth Day, face reality, shoulder arduous tasks, endure hardship and hard work, and actively struggle, then we will not only be able to maintain the glorious history of hard work created by the martyrs, but also be able to eliminate the bandit disaster, eliminate obstacles, and build a new China with the Three Principles of the People, prosperous, strong, and happy.

### Ma Qing Leads Delegation to Bogota: Pan-American Conference to Open Tomorrow; To Discuss Anti-Communist Treaty in the Western Hemisphere

[Reuters, Bogota, 28th] The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to be officially opened here next Tuesday by Colombian President Velez. The U.S. delegation is led by Marshall himself, and includes Treasury Secretary Snyder, Commerce Secretary Harriman, Export-Import Bank Accountant Martin, and Ambassador to Brazil Paulley, with an unparalleled strong lineup. Guatemala's proposal to end the colonies of England, France, and the Netherlands in Central and South America will be submitted for discussion at the meeting. However, those concerned expect that the United States, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela will oppose this proposal, believing that it is not appropriate to weaken the solidarity of Western allies and the Western Hemisphere in today's tense international situation. Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and most Central American countries, who have doubts about the government of President Alawiro of Guatemala, are also expected to support the United States. In addition, the U.S. policy may be to require the conference to establish a broad economic constitution to reduce trade restrictions and open up channels for private investment.

[United Press, Washington, 27th] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Yahil flew to Columbia City today to participate in the American Conference. The advance team of senior American representatives has also left here. Secretary of State Marshall and Commerce Secretary Harriman also left here this afternoon.

[United Press, Bogota, 28th] The Pan-American Conference will open on the 30th, and the preparatory staff is feeling apprehensive due to the lack of electricity in Colombia and the partial failure of telecommunications equipment here. Colombia has experienced six months of severe sheep farming, resulting in a near-depleted supply of materials, and the reduction in hydropower electricity has led to fears that the U.S. Army's starter motor will be borrowed during the conference. There is only one line between here and North America and Central America , which was recently damaged, and telecommunications rely on only three wireless motors for maintenance.

### US Military Authority Defined; Army Reserve Officers Ordered to Remain; General Bradley to Tour Pacific This Summer

Forrestal presented to the President the report of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's meeting at the Key West Naval Base in Florida from March 11th to 14th, stating that the mission of each branch has been clearly defined. The Air Force's primary mission will be strategic and tactical operations; the Navy's primary mission is to conduct aerial tactics to achieve objectives in naval warfare; and the Naval Air Force, under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, may participate in air combat missions. The Navy may engage any target to fulfill its mission. The Navy's primary mission is to prevent submarine activity, while the Air Force will only provide auxiliary support. Forrestal pointed out that the most important principle is to achieve victory in any future war the United States participates in with the most economical use of time and manpower. The Marine Corps' mission is primarily amphibious warfare and its main focus will be on developing amphibious warfare techniques and equipment.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The Department of the Army revealed today that 20,000 reserve officers on active duty, originally slated for demobilization, will remain in their positions pending congressional decisions on conscription.

Previously, some in naval circles speculated it might be the US submarine "Carp," which was currently conducting exercises, but "Carp" remains docked in Monterey Bay.

### American Experts Analyze: Soviet Strength Immense

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] New York Times military analyst Baldwin stated that the Soviet Union's army is superior and its territory spans Western Europe and East Asia. Therefore, should war occur, the Soviet Union could quickly seize Europe, Korea, the Middle East, Northeast China, and North China. According to Baldwin, who has studied Soviet military strength, if the Soviet army and its vassal states' armies launched an offensive tomorrow, they could occupy Korea within days or weeks, reach the Yellow River basin within three months, and occupy Austria, Hungary, France, Germany, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, etc., within forty-five days. Baldwin stated that although the Soviet army is strong, with 94 divisions, its equipment is inferior, especially lacking aircraft and ships. The Soviet Union is currently assisting in improving the armies of its vassal states, standardizing them. He believes the Soviets are indeed preparing for a future major war, but will they launch an actual invasion? Baldwin believes the Soviet economic and industrial plans indicate long-term preparation, not emergency preparation. Moreover, the Soviets are currently achieving great success through political ideology, economics, and fomenting rebellion. Therefore, the Soviet Union will not risk war while it is benefiting greatly from these methods.

### Soviet Attitude Unpredictable; Finns Surprised; Suspect More Tricks Up Their Sleeve

[Reuters, Helsinki, 28th] Moscow's policy in the Soviet-Finnish treaty negotiations remains difficult for the Finnish side to grasp. The slowness of the Soviet side has surprised the Finns, but there is little doubt that the Soviets still have tricks up their sleeves. Observers already believe that the strong statements from Washington over the past week have had some effect. They believe the Soviet Union may therefore adjust its political strategy in Northern Europe to cope with a vigilant United States. Meanwhile, well-informed Finnish sources have denied that Finland has reduced its resistance to Soviet pressure. The Finnish government broke with the traditional Easter holiday to hold an informal meeting today to discuss possible developments in Moscow. Finnish political figures believe the Soviet Union has not yet laid its demands on the table, a situation that surprises the Finns. New developments are expected in the Moscow negotiations at any time.

### Twenty-Nine US Merchant Ships Transferred to Italy

### Czechoslovak Arms Industry Entirely Under Soviet Control; Integrated with Romania, Bulgaria, and Other Countries into a Single Economic Unit

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Following the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union has seized control of the large-scale Skoda arms industry, which served as Europe's armory during both World Wars. Military experts say the Soviet Union has already achieved its actual goal of controlling the Skoda arms factory since the Red Army entered Czechoslovakia. Those engaged in assessing the war potential within the Communist and anti-Communist spheres of influence have long considered Skoda no longer an asset to the potential war efforts of Western nations. The Communist seizure of power two weeks ago has further confirmed their estimates.

The Skoda factory includes 35 major plants, producing everything from plowshares and tractors to small arms and artillery. From 1932 to 1937, before Hitler took over, the Skoda factory produced 14 percent of the world's arms exports, and Hitler expanded it further. Skoda has not completely converted to peacetime production of agricultural tools, railways, and industrial equipment. The factory still accepts military equipment orders from the Soviet Union, Egypt, Sweden, Argentina, Yugoslavia, and Switzerland. According to well-informed military sources, the Forestdings Chaiberro Kovka factory alone produces 25 million rounds of 7.92 caliber bullets, 5 million detonators, 300,000 rounds of 20 cm artillery shells, 20,000 rocket shells, and 1,000 Anglan-style rifles per month. Skoda's industrial production includes agricultural machinery, railway locomotives, and vehicles, most of which have been shipped to the Soviet Union since the war. Czechoslovakia's primary strategic importance lies in its industrial and mineral resources. The country has basic raw materials and power resources for unlimited industrial development. In addition to its rich iron ore deposits and steel industry comparable to the Saar River valley, Czechoslovakia also has important uranium ore deposits, essential for the production of atomic energy and atomic bombs. All production from Czech uranium mines is shipped to the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union wants to link Czechoslovakia's industrial potential with Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria, to create a successful economic unit no longer dependent on Western Europe.

### Arab Nations Consider Concluding Military Alliance; Easter Truce of One Day Between Arabs and Jews

[Reuters, Geneva, 27th] The US representative submitted a draft international convention to the International Conference on Freedom of the Press, aiming to make news free from national restrictions and facilitate the activities of foreign journalists. The full text contains approximately sixteen articles, with key points including: (1) Each signatory country shall allow news from other signatory countries to enter its country on a most-favored-nation basis; (2) Inspection, delays, modifications, etc., shall not be implemented unless necessary for military security; (3) Any signatory country may request another signatory country to declare the truth in various ways to correct erroneous reports by foreign journalists; (4) All foreign journalists shall have equal rights to news sources and various locations; (5) Special restrictions shall not be imposed on the entry and exit of foreign journalists.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 27th, United Press] Philippine representative Borromeo told the Committee on Freedom of News Publication and Adoption: The Philippines is determined to support any proposal that protects freedom of news and speech, regardless of race, nationality, religion, or political affiliation. He stated, "We are well aware that this freedom has been abused by irresponsible individuals. However, abuses of this nature have been corrected in a timely manner by public opinion itself. Only in a system that controls public opinion, where people do not choose to think freely or speak freely, and thus controlled public opinion, cannot actively take the necessary corrective measures."

[United Press, Geneva, 27th] During the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Hungary spoke on the spot, fiercely attacking American newspapers. The Hungarian representative cited the words of US Senator Bridges, saying that the United States intends to support underground anti-communist movements in Eastern Europe.

### Yugoslavia Increases Defenses in Trieste; Italian Communist Leader Attacks Britain and America

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 28th] According to reports received here on the morning of the 28th: There have been significant troop movements in the Yugoslav-occupied area of ​​Trieste. The message stated that 2,000 Yugoslav troops have arrived in Zgonik, and all housing in the area has been ordered to be vacated to accommodate the troops. This incident has deeply impressed the residents. It was also reported that after the US cruiser "Tidewater" left the Port of Trieste on a ten-day cruise, the 10,000-ton cruiser "Minneapolis" immediately arrived at the Port of Trieste.

[Reuters, Trieste, 28th] The agreement by Britain, the United States, and France to return the Port of Trieste to Italy has been a major blow to the Communist Party in the Port of Trieste. Attendance at last week's Communist Party meeting was only two to four thousand people, whereas in past leftist demonstrations, participants often numbered over thirty thousand. Meanwhile, Major General Airey, commander of the British-American military forces in Trieste, issued a declaration today denying rumors of future British troop reinforcements, stating that the British-American zone of Trieste is very peaceful, and there is no reason to believe that this stability will not continue.

[Reuters, Rome, 27th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti delivered a speech to 70,000 people here, stating that Western countries want to drag Italy into another war to confront the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. He urged Italians to use their votes on April 18 to stop this policy of the United States and Western countries, letting them understand that Italy is determined not to adhere to a policy of war and not to align with the interests of the Italian people. Togliatti firmly stated that the People's Democratic Front must achieve victory at any cost, as only the People's Democratic Front can establish a solid barrier to prevent those who would betray the country. Togliatti also mentioned the issue of the Port of Trieste, saying that Western countries are trying to show that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party oppose the return of Trieste to Italy, in order to provoke an Italian nationalist movement and allow the reactionary faction to defeat the democratic forces. However, Yugoslavia has declared its willingness to review the treaty with a democratic Italy regarding the clauses of the Port of Trieste. The fact that Britain, the United States, and France do not seek Yugoslavia's opinion is an attempt to preserve the Italian Eastern Border issue, making it a potential flashpoint for a major war.

### Pope's Easter Broadcast

[United Press, Vatican City, 28th] Pope Pius XII delivered an Easter blessing in St. Peter's Square today and declared to the people that the time has come for Christians to be aware, to have courage, and to follow their conscience and vocation, and not to blindly follow those who deny religion and reject the sacred.

Candidates from the government party also held campaign rallies, explaining to the public that they must vote for the "Sun Symbol." This sun symbol was chosen by the government to make it easier for people who cannot read or write to understand. The opposition parties participating in the election include the Liberal Party and the Democratic Peasants' Party. The Liberal Party has nominated 22 candidate lists in about half of the regions across the country, and the Democratic Peasants' Party has nominated six candidate lists in six provinces across the country.

### Amazing Flying Ability of Homing Pigeons; Long Journeys Without Sleep or Food

Highest Record of Over 30 Hours for Flying from Tianjin to Shanghai; Choosing Well-Bred Mates and Forcibly Mating Several Times Each Year

[Our Newspaper's Special Report] In the two World Wars, homing pigeons performed their greatest function in countless battles; in the campaign to encircle and suppress Ding Xishan, intelligence liaison between Songhu and Shanghai also relied partially on homing pigeons. There are quite a few homing pigeons in Shanghai, but apart from those for military use, most are still serving as "professional athletes" for competitions. Although homing pigeons are non-productive animals, people who raise homing pigeons still have a strong interest, and it is said that the pleasure in this is far greater than appreciating cricket fighting or listening to songbirds sing. Judging homing pigeons cannot simply rely on appearance. Beautiful feathers and imposing appearance are often the most useless things. Like the famous breeds "Stassart" and "Bricoux," which belong to the original Belgian breeds of homing pigeons, their appearance is plain and unassuming, and they are quiet and rarely move, but they can often perform amazingly in flight. These "famous pigeons" are now imported from foreign countries, and are worth 100 US dollars a pair. The seller must provide a "pigeon family tree" when selling, with great-grandparents, uncles, and brothers all recorded in detail. The breeder must choose a well-bred mate for it, forcibly marrying it several times a year, and must also continue the genealogy for it, distinguishing between collateral and orthodox lines, and must not be wrong or mistaken, until its death.

Maintaining the Breed; Emphasizing Lineage

The marriage of homing pigeons is most valued by breeders, because in order to continue to maintain excellent lineage, they often make extremely clear distinctions regarding the pigeon's noble ancestry. Pigeons from different lineages cannot be combined, and pigeons with too close a relationship and bloodline cannot be combined, otherwise the breed will be mixed and confused, and the intelligence and flying ability of the next generation of pigeons will be significantly reduced. Before the transfer of Japanese military homing pigeons after the war, the breeding record tables were burned. Later, a portion of the excellent homing pigeons were transferred and scattered among the people. Because it was impossible to investigate their ancestral origin, breeders could only hastily arrange marriages for them. According to statistics, almost none of the young pigeons hatched after this kind of "free combination" can exceed the standards of their parents in any respect.

Extraordinary Talent; Establishing Distinguished Service

The origins of homing pigeons can be immediately seen when they officially fly. Xi Baoru, director of the Homing Pigeon Association, had a young pigeon that, before it was even five months old, flew back to Shanghai from Wuhu. Later, it was released from various ports along the Beijing-Shanghai and Hangzhou lines, and achieved excellent results every time, and never got lost. Turning over its pedigree, it turned out that its father was a competitor who flew back to Shanghai from Wenzhou for the SHC (Shanghai Homing Pigeon Association before the war), and its mother was even more outstanding, having flown back to Shanghai from Fengyang under the SHC in 1937. With extraordinary talent, it established distinguished service. In addition, in a homing pigeon race after the victory, a young pigeon that flew out from Wuxi and won the second place, its father had flown back to Shanghai from Haimen, and its mother was said to be a long-distance flight expert. A family of many outstanding individuals is often discovered in the pigeon family. The highest record for long-distance flight of Chinese homing pigeons is a pigeon belonging to Li Meiling, which flew back to Shanghai from Tianjin before the war, in more than thirty hours. To date, no pigeon has broken this record. There are currently more than 8,000 old pigeons and nearly 4,000 young pigeons in Shanghai, a portion of which have achieved above-standard results, having flown back to Shanghai from Nanjing within the standard time of three and a half hours, which is not inferior to the speed of an airplane.

Five Young Pigeons Released from Yanhu

Suzhou and Kunshan are the Most Difficult to Recognize

Young pigeons hatch in eighteen days, and can be trained to fly after one and a half months. The training method is to go from near to far. Usually, they are first released in the city sky to observe, and it is said that pigeons can identify the location of their nest at this time, determining its distance from the Huangpu River and the International Hotel, and will never forget it after that. Then, the breeder takes it to Nanxiang, Kunshan, and heads north along the various stations of the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou lines, or south along Jia, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Xiamen, going further and further away. Among them, the two stations of Suzhou and Kunshan on the Beijing-Shanghai line are the greatest test of the pigeon's intelligence and ability, because the area is densely covered with lakes and marshes, and the terrain is difficult to recognize. It is very difficult for ten out of ten of the slightly less capable homing pigeons to find their way back to their nest. If they can exceed this and the flying point can reach Wuxi, then the qualification for the competition has already been obtained, and they can participate and show their skills in formal competitions.

Swooping Down Like a Bombing

The perseverance, endurance, and loyalty of homing pigeons are most commendable among small animals. No matter how far the journey, they never eat, sleep, or rest. If there is wind and rain along the way, they fly low. If they encounter falcons, they avoid them. Day and night, they finally reach their nest and stop. Someone once used a telescope to observe the posture of a homing pigeon returning from a long journey. It soars above the clouds, and once it discovers its target, it folds its wings and swoops down, like a dive bomber, brave and calm.

Living in Luxury and Receiving Special Honors

The pigeons of the Shanghai Homing Pigeon Association and the Standard Homing Pigeon Association before the war made many contributions to transmitting intelligence during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the reorganization and establishment of the Homing Pigeon Association after the victory, almost all of the more than one hundred members are people who have devoted themselves to raising pigeons. They have mostly built rather luxurious pigeon lofts at home, with sanitary facilities, automatic opening and closing doors and windows, and even an electric chronograph board, which is specially used for recording time during competitions. These pigeons live a life of luxury in their limited lifespan of fifteen years, drinking and eating with moderation, and exercising regularly. Usually living in luxury, when they spread their wings and fly all night and the record is completed, they also receive a glorious award. To most people who work hard all their lives and struggle for food and clothing all day long, this kind of happiness is indeed a bit extravagant.

### A Tragedy on Xiangyang South Road: Man Killed, Woman Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night around ten o'clock, a man named Zhang Meilong and his girlfriend, Miss Chen, were leaving the public night school attached to the Haiguang Elementary School on Nangyang South Road after class.

### Over Two Hundred Arrested; To Be Transferred to the Special Criminal Court

The military and police authorities in Shanghai have recently uncovered a large-scale Communist bandit organization, arresting over two hundred people. The authorities will release detailed information about the case in the coming days. The arrested individuals are to be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial. According to a reporter from the Dagong News Agency, the Communist bandits originally planned to launch a "Five Strikes and One Uprising" movement in Shanghai on Labor Day, May 1st, of this year (strikes by workers, students, merchants, teachers, and civil servants, as well as refugee riots) to coordinate with the Communist military operations in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu loudly proclaimed the slogan "Crossing the River in May" to echo the conspiracy of the Communist bandits in Shanghai. Now that their leadership organization has been uncovered by the authorities, their dream of "Five Strikes and One Uprising" has been shattered. The Communist bandits' plan for "Five Strikes and One Uprising" is hereby revealed as follows:

Strikes by Workers

Since the "September 9th Tragedy," the Communist bandits have been using the incident to mobilize their labor cadres under the city committee to go around under the guise of raising donations to console the workers injured and killed in the "September 9th" incident, conducting anti-government propaganda and raising the slogan of abolishing wage deductions. Tao Yunshan, the self-confessed chairman of the silk weaving industry union in the third district, and the Communist Party member Shen Mo in the union, Yang Ming (female) of the Taikang Canning Company, Hu Xiujuan of the Guanghua Knitting Factory in the second district, Pan Xuezhen of the Kangfu Factory, and Lu Xiuying, etc. (all of the above have been arrested), as well as certain elements in the public utility machinery industry, have been very active in this matter, attempting to expand the disturbances and create a citywide general strike.

Strikes by Students

In the student movement aspect, they plan to continue creating an atmosphere of the "Kowloon Incident," and then mobilize college and middle school students and their families to launch a petition movement under the pretext of being unable to afford tuition, with the ultimate goal of boycotting classes.

Strikes by Merchants

This spring, the Communist bandits issued a so-called "CPC Civil Movement Work Instructions," which instructed their hidden cadres in Shanghai on the commercial front to coordinate with the labor and student movements, rebuild the core, and use the slogans of "Resisting American Goods" and "Launching Tax Evasion" as the center of activity, in order to achieve a united strike by merchants.

Strikes by Teachers

They plan to intensify public school teachers' emotions regarding their personal interests, using the faculty and staff of various schools as the main force and civil servants as a shield, to launch a campaign to fight for monthly salary adjustments and maintain the original rations, and implement strikes by teachers when necessary.

Strikes by Civil Servants

They plan to mobilize the city's police force, using low income and inability to make a living as a rallying cry to start a strike. As for the above two items of teachers and civil servants, since the public school teachers have a high level of education and are aware of the Communist bandits' conspiracy, the Communist Party has no way to infiltrate. As for the police, since the organization is strict, strikes by teachers and civil servants cannot be implemented.

Refugee Riots

If the aforementioned "Five Strikes and One Uprising" occurs, they will incite the refugees from northern Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and other places who have fled to Shanghai, using slogans such as soaring prices, people unable to make a living, and demanding relief, to launch citywide looting and large-scale riots, so as to cause social unrest and achieve the goal of popular rebellion.

### Taikang Head Factory Resumes Work Yesterday

Workers at the Taikang Canning Company stopped working a few days ago due to the instigation of a few individuals because some of them, including female worker Yang Ming and Shui Zhang, were suspected of being reactionary and were arrested in the recent crackdown by the authorities. After persuasion by members of the social circles, all the workers understood the greater meaning, so they resumed work yesterday. However, since yesterday was Sunday, which was originally a day off with the power off, the factory temporarily requested the power company to connect the power, and started work at 2:00 pm. The situation in the factory is currently very good.

### Case of Norwegian Running Black Market for US Dollars Uncovered; Evidence and Case Files Transferred to District Procuratorate for Investigation

The Garrison Headquarters recently uncovered an international financial disruption case. A Norwegian named Yingsheng, who runs the Yingsheng Foreign Firm at Room 314, Huiluo Building, 401 Sichuan Road in this city, secretly specializes in running a black market for US dollars. After being reported to the Garrison Headquarters, they immediately sent undercover agents and borrowed 10,000 US dollars from the Shanghai Financial Administration in advance. They then pretended to negotiate a transaction with the person in charge of the firm, Yingsheng, and immediately agreed to exchange 10,000 US dollars for 1,182 million legal tender. At that time, Poles Gu Bingsiji and Rosenberk were also in the firm engaging in buying and selling. The agents pre-arranged by the Garrison Headquarters suddenly rushed out and arrested Yingsheng, Gu Bingsiji, Rosenberk, and others, and searched out a large batch of documents and US dollars. After the department interrogated them, they transferred the entire case file to the District Procuratorate yesterday for investigation on the charge of disrupting finance. The case is currently being investigated by the prosecutor Quan Tao of the procuratorate.

### Suspicion of Embezzlement Through Sale of Stocks; Old Case Reorganized at Jiangsu Provincial Bank; Director Yan Huiyu Reported; Investigation Difficult Due to Length of Time

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yan Huiyu, managing director of Jiangsu Provincial Bank, was reported by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly for selling more than 10,000 shares of official shares of Nantong Dasheng Textile Factory without authorization. The case is currently under investigation by agencies in this city. After Jiangsu Province fell in the autumn of 1948, Yan took some of the bank's employees to take refuge in the Shanghai Concession. Due to the high expenses, he sold more than 10,000 shares of Nantong Dasheng Textile Factory, which the bank held, to Jin Cheng Bank for more than 190,000 yuan (now worth about 30 billion yuan), and telegraphed the head office for approval, but the head office did not approve. Later, due to the prolonged war, no one pursued the matter. After the victory, Jiangsu Provincial Bank resumed business and reorganized the old files, discovering that more than 10,000 shares of Dasheng Textile Factory were missing. When Yan was asked, he said that the money was used to maintain the livelihood of the Shanghai-based employees at that time and had been used up. Because it was an emergency, he did not follow the usual procedures. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly believed that Yan had sold the official shares without obtaining legal procedures and could not say that there was no suspicion of embezzlement. Since the incident occurred in this city, they sent a letter to the judicial authorities of this city for handling, which also involved Lu Zidong, a member of the business community in this city. Yan and Lu were interrogated a few days ago. However, because the case occurred a long time ago, most of the Jiangsu Provincial Bank's files have been burned by the enemy and puppets, and the Dasheng stocks have also changed hands several times, making the investigation very difficult. The judicial authorities have sent letters to relevant agencies to inquire, but have not received a reply so far. The case still needs to summon the parties involved for a decision.

### Poor Woman Found Dead on Tianping Road

[Report from Our Newspaper] In front of the Lianyie Motor Company at the intersection of Tianping Road and Yuan Road, around 2:00 pm yesterday, a young woman, about twenty years old, was found lying dead on the ground, dressed in rags, looking like a beggar. After being discovered by the police on duty, the report was made to the Xujiahui Police Station.

### Shareholders' Meeting of China Book Company Passes Resolutions on Capital Increase, Etc.

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, the China Book Company held a regular shareholders' meeting at the Bank of China to discuss the revaluation and capital increase, amendments to the articles of association, and the re-election of directors and supervisors. Because this shareholders' meeting was the company's first regular meeting after the war, there was an unusually large number of attendees and shares. By 2:30 pm, the reported shares had reached more than two-thirds. The meeting began at 3:00 pm, and the shareholders unanimously elected Du Yuesheng as the temporary chairman. General Manager Li Shuming reported on the company's progress over the past ten years, and then the proposals and amendments to the articles of association were discussed and passed. The company's revaluation and capital increase this time is 10 billion yuan. The dividends for previous terms have reached 2 billion, so the 11% cash that should be paid according to the revaluation and capital increase method can also be transferred from the previous dividends, that is, each share can get 1,250 shares without paying cash. The company also has preferential coupons and gifts for the shareholders, so all the shareholders were very happy. The election of directors and supervisors has not yet been counted, but according to the rough estimate of the vote counters, the old directors and supervisors are generally re-elected. The votes for the newly added directors are mostly cast for Du Yuesheng, Xu Shihao, Lu Fei Mingzhong, Wu Shutong, Li Changyun, Chen and Wu Mingran.

### Offering Ten Thousand Yuan Bribe; The Crime Is the Same Regardless of the Amount; Old Quartermaster Indicted

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of offering a 10,000 yuan bribe was recently filed by the District Procuratorate. The defendant, Chen Yongsheng, is an old quartermaster at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. On the morning of the 27th of last month, when he was supervising the unloading of goods from the factory's truck at Wufu Lane on Ningbo Road, he was seen by police officer No. 2252, who believed that the narrow road and the parking were obstructing traffic and took measures to stop it. Unexpectedly, Chen solemnly took out 10,000 yuan from his pocket to offer a bribe to avoid the penalty. The police officer believed that 10,000 yuan could only buy two sesame cakes, which was an intentional insult, so he took Chen to the police station, and then transferred him to the District Procuratorate for investigation. After investigation by the prosecutor, because the amount of the bribe was small, but the crime was the same, he was indicted for the crime of Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law.

### General Chennault Discusses US Policy Toward China

Copyright, Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance. Translated by our Newspaper Translation Department.

(2) Two Interlocking Characteristics

The political and military situation in China today has been largely caused by the official encouragement of the Chinese Communists and the obstruction of the Chinese Central Government by the United States.

During the four years of our wartime alliance with the Chinese Central Government, this phenomenon blossomed like a strange flower in the middle of the war and has been blooming ever since—too long, I think.

Our encouragement of armed rebellion against a universally recognized government, and our carping campaign against that government, are equally peculiar interlocking factors. This carping campaign started with helpful criticism and turned into outright slander.

These two interlocking characteristics of our policy clearly meet the wishes of the Communist fellow travelers, even if it is not the result of their activities in wartime Chongqing and elsewhere.

To what extent our policy was directly confused by fellow travelers, I cannot say now. Since I am more concerned with the results than with the motives, I consider this a theoretical question anyway. In fact, the success expected by the destroyers of Sino-American cooperation has been greater than they themselves could have achieved. American officials who have fulfilled this expectation have been tools of the fellow travelers.

I am not saying that responsible American officials were deliberately playing Communist tricks in Chongqing, but I do accuse them of falling into the Communist trap, and by doing so, they have harmed our cooperation with the Chinese Central Government during the critical stage of the war and almost permanently.

Regarding the wartime and post-war US policy toward the tendency of compromise and appeasement with the Chinese Communists, I can only write this way - regarding the goal of appeasing the Chinese Communists, it is now happily denied by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, although this was only heard recently.

On the one hand, speaking ill of the Central Government behind its back, and on the other hand, patting the Communists on the back, this two-pronged trick has met and helped to promote the political crisis in Free China in 1944. If it had not been for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's expulsion of General Stilwell at that time, this crisis would almost certainly have ended in destroying the Sino-American joint efforts at that time.

We will now discuss the two situations of the American policy at that time one by one the spectacle of American officials being unsympathetic to wartime allies, and the mutual factors of our "openly talking about love" with the Chinese Reds.

Before General Wedemeyer replaced General Stilwell in 1944, the staff consultations between the US and the Chinese government almost continued to be excessive pressure and intimidation. In fact, this only symbolized the low estimation of a Chinese leader by Stilwell and his staff, and this leader had been resisting Japan for four years before the Pearl Harbor Incident.

At that time, the similarities between our military and diplomatic relations with China were obvious, even if the military aspect was not so peculiar. In this memoir, I am more prepared to directly discuss the latter.

American leaders seem unable to get along with the Chinese people on the basis of mutual understanding, mutual assistance, and mutual respect. "A Chinese soldier, if given proper training, equipment, and supplies, is able to fight" - this view, said again and again, is the greatest sign that Stilwell and his subordinates can express their confidence in the Chinese people.

This unhelpful statement has confused many American war correspondents and seems to have made Stilwell the benefactor of China. In fact, this statement has underestimated the potential of China and is almost a slander.

As if it were a planned scheme, the American evaluation of the Chinese Central Government and its affiliated institutions (including the military) has become the talk of the town wherever Americans gather. On the one hand, American soldiers elsewhere are ordered to avoid talking about the Chinese government, but on the other hand, the American military officers in Chongqing are constantly reciting the actual or imaginary shortcomings of the Chinese government without any slack, and have become an approved habit.

Even if what they said was true, these incantations have gone beyond the scope of ordinary arbitrary speech, not to mention that it is not true, so this is enough to show the depth and magnitude of their imprudence and thoughtlessness.

Frequent contact between headquarters personnel and American war correspondents (mostly informal) has increased this mass production of criticism of China. Not only the American military, but also the reporters, are guests of the Chinese government in China, and they seem to care little about the fact that this government is often criticized.

My air force headquarters was in Kunming, but I often went to the war zone headquarters in Chongqing. Every time I went to Chongqing, if I wanted to listen, I could always hear the echo of this movement. This cannot be regarded as a whispering movement it is too loud.

Stilwell never met with American reporters in Chongqing, but his disrespectful opinions were always provided to reporters in private talks or news conferences under the name of "not for publication." From a reporter who arrived in Chongqing at the end of 1943, I got an example. In a "not for publication" talk, he asked Stilwell what China needed most at that time to continue fighting.

To this question, Stilwell simply replied: "Carefully select a hundred heads and kill them all."

General Stilwell's low estimation of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is often revealed. I remember one of the most important examples.

In the spring of 1943, President Roosevelt convened a joint chiefs of staff meeting in Washington, and I was ordered to attend. Churchill was also present. President Roosevelt asked Stilwell to give an overview of the Chinese situation. Stilwell stood up and violently criticized Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, saying that the Generalissimo was unreliable, ungrateful, insincere, and unfaithful. Mr. Roosevelt interrupted his speech and asked, "Chennault, what do you think of this?" I stood up and told them that in all the years I have stayed in China, the Generalissimo has never broken faith with me in any way. I think he is a great man and the only leader who can unite China."

This time, General Stilwell's and my comments were both recorded in the White House records.

### Xing'an Ship - Commissioning Announcement

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] American labor is expensive. Under the slogan of "more work, more pay," the efficiency of contract workers, whose two days' wages equal a month's salary for our commissioning soldiers, is highly suspect, and the achievements of the contractors are even more difficult to mention. The "Xing'an" ship departed from the Port of New Orleans on November 7th. After about a week, it passed through the Panama Canal and discovered a crack in the left main engine, leaking more than 900 gallons of water per day. With no other choice, they had to pump water while sailing. Approaching Christmas, they welded and repaired it in San Francisco for two weeks, but after only a day and night of sailing, it leaked again. They sailed back to San Francisco for further repairs and continued sailing. However, the aging engine should have been overhauled long ago. In less than three days, the left main engine continued to leak. The Americans knew they could no longer cope with it and finally performed a major overhaul in Pearl Harbor, staying for forty days, replacing a jacket for the left main engine. They left Pearl Harbor on February 18th this year, passing through Yokosuka and sailing back to the homeland.

The "Xing'an" ship has a full load displacement of 3,919 tons, a length of 328 feet, and a width of 50 feet. Painted in silver-gray, it majestically docks on the Yangtze River. Standing on it, apart from the uneven and scarred deck, it is hard to imagine its previous dilapidated appearance, but the repair process described above is entirely true. When General Gui Yongqing received the thick commissioning report from Captain Xu, he undoubtedly also accepted the various hardships and pains experienced by the ninety-nine officers and soldiers over the past nine months. At the same time, for the Chinese new navy gaining another new piece, he expressed his heartfelt congratulations on their outstanding achievements.

Returning Home - Welcomed Everywhere

On the return journey of the "Xing'an" ship, departing from New Orleans, it passed through Havana (Habna), the capital of Cuba, Colon and Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone, Acapulco in Mexico, San Francisco and Pearl Harbor in the United States, and Yokosuka in Japan, totaling several ports. Although the overseas Chinese were not notified in advance because it was not an official visit, the welcome they received was still grand and enthusiastic. Most of the commissioning officers were veterans of the Taikang and other eight ships from thirty-five years ago. The situation from two years ago unfolded again before their eyes. Overseas compatriots everywhere, upon discovering warships flying the national flag of their motherland berthed in the harbor, would automatically row sampans to board the ships for visits, in an endless stream, lingering and forgetting to return. The guest signature book on the ship already had the names of thousands of overseas Chinese.

Overseas Chinese, relying on their strong vitality in various places, mostly started from scratch and lived frugally, but when warships from their motherland visited their residences, they spared no expense to hold grand welcome meetings, even filming movies for remembrance. This fully demonstrates their sincere love for their motherland. Warships from their motherland brought them warmth and pride. They rarely have the opportunity to return home, so boarding warships flying the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth felt like stepping onto their homeland. Therefore, they are grateful to the Chinese Navy and cherish the Chinese Navy. This time, the officers of the "Xing'an" ship were often asked by overseas Chinese about the rumors of smuggling by the Taikang and other eight ships from the previous year. When they learned that the rumors were completely unfounded, that the slandered officers were innocent, and that they were still serving honorably in the Navy, they breathed a sigh of relief. Therefore, when it comes to those unfounded and malicious rumors, Captain Xu believes:

"This is not just a matter of the integrity of one or two naval officers or one or two warships; it concerns the honor and disgrace of the entire nation."

When the "Xing'an" ship approached the homeland, our customs notified the Naval Headquarters, saying: "According to reports, the Xing'an warship is carrying a large number of smuggled goods from the United States. Please pay close attention to the inspection." General Gui Yongqing ordered the "Xing'an" ship to sail directly to Nanjing and anchor in the center of the Yangtze River off Xiaguan. It was not allowed to dock until he had inspected it. As a result, the "Xing'an" ship was completely innocent.

An Inspiration: People Must Help Themselves

The "Xing'an" ship is only a small part of American aid, but in the context of the current trend of American aid to China, the acquisition, repair, and use of the "Xing'an" ship precisely reveals an unshakeable truth:

"People must help themselves!"

The "Xing'an" ship is just a medium-sized or smaller old tank landing ship that the US Navy had already decommissioned, with crude construction, but it is still very useful to us. The machine tools in the repair bay on the ship, including drilling machines, iron beds, planers, and welding equipment, are more than capable of repairing ordinary ships. This asset is also quite considerable in terms of value. The United States, based on a single agreement, generously donated a total of 271 ships, large and small, new and old, similar to it to us. In any case, it is a great act of kindness and friendship. Therefore, even if the "Xing'an" ship is more dilapidated, the Chinese cannot say there is anything that shouldn't be. Adding an adjective to the donated ships in the Sino-US Naval Agreement, that is, handing over the ships in the condition and location they were in at the time of signing the agreement, perhaps some broken ships would have already sunk to the bottom of the sea before they could be received, and we could dispose of them however we pleased.

When the "Xing'an" ship was being repaired in the Port of New Orleans, the US Navy provided assistance in terms of repair, supply, and navigation. Captain Xu specifically expressed his gratitude during a press conference. But in fact, the Americans always believed that the poor Chinese Navy had too high expectations for this broken ship, and their coldness seemed to outweigh their enthusiasm. Borrowing tools and adding equipment encountered difficulties that were truly indescribable. At the same time, it coincided with General Wedemeyer's visit to China as a special envoy to investigate. Although a small part of American public opinion advocated aid to China, the majority still opposed it. The conservative southern states of the United States severely criticized the federal government's aid measures, not only believing that lending money to China was completely giving it to corrupt officials to squander, but also that donating old and dilapidated warships with little prospect of being of much use to the Chinese government was a waste. Under these circumstances, in order to accomplish the mission, the commissioning personnel, in addition to overcoming the shortage of tools and equipment and the various hardships that only Chinese workers could endure, also had to endure mental oppression. Accepting aid itself was a heavy burden on the motherland.

The acquisition, repair, and use of a "Xing'an" ship were so difficult. Thanks to the dedication and efforts of the ninety-nine commissioning officers and soldiers of our new navy, they were able to turn decay into magic, transforming the dilapidated fuel tank into a floating repair factory that could better help other ships. This fact solemnly shows us that "If you don't help yourself, others can't help you."

### Fengxian Exposes and Bans Usurious Grain Loans

[Our Fengxian Dispatch, 26th] Farmers in the Touqiao Town area of Wuhua Township in this county have no choice but to resort to loans to maintain farming and daily life. Some unscrupulous people take the opportunity to exploit them by issuing usurious grain loans. For example, borrowing one stone of grain for a period of four months requires the return of two stones of grain. Moreover, when borrowing, the inferior indica rice is only 150 catties, but when returning, it must be 160 catties of superior japonica rice, and it must be clearly stated on the loan note. Farmers are drinking poison to quench their thirst and have no other choice. It is said that there are many people in the town who engage in this business. Now, it has been discovered by people from the town living abroad, who have collected the facts and reported the names to the relevant authorities in this county, requesting strict bans to benefit the rural areas. The authorities are currently dispatching personnel to secretly investigate in order to gather evidence for handling the matter.

### Suxian Zhou Dongsheng Murdered, Support Association Strictly Apprehends the Murderer

[Our Suxian Dispatch, 26th] After Senator Zhou Dongsheng was assassinated, various agencies and legal entities organized a support association at the cinema on the evening of the 25th, issued a declaration, posted slogans, and offered a reward of 50 million yuan for the apprehension of the murderer. The police局 arrested two suspects in the case, Qin Deyu and Mr. Yang, who have been sent to the court for interrogation. On the same night that the case occurred, an assassination also took place in Dongguan. Zhang Aichen, who had served as the head of Xiangshan Township, was avoiding bandits and living with his family in the Cai Garden in Dongguan. That night, Zhang and his wife had a quarrel and only went to bed late at night. Suddenly, four bandits in military uniforms broke into Zhang's room, shone a flashlight, and shot Zhang several times in a row. Zhang rolled away to avoid the shots and was injured in the left rib. His wife raised her own pistol and fired back, killing one bandit in the head. The remaining bandits fled.

### Bandits Attack Yuci Border Area

[Our Yuyao Dispatch, 26th] In the town of Lubu, at the border of Yu (Yao) and Ci (Xi), suddenly at around 11 o'clock last night (25th), a large number of bandits, more than 200 in total, wearing gray uniforms and carrying various weapons, first searched the original residence of the Zhejiang Security Team, the Dazhuang Temple in Lubu, and then fled to the Lubu Township Office (belonging to Cixi), burning all documents and equipment, and looting a telephone switchboard. They also kidnapped Zhang Jilin, a plainclothes officer of the Zhejiang Security Team stationed in Lubu, resident Zhang Jipin, as well as the town team deputy and a telephone operator. In the direction of Zhuangqi Mountain, the bandits stabbed the plainclothes officer Zhang Jilin to death with a sharp knife. The telephone operator and the town team deputy were released on the 26th.

### Divine Lottery as Ballot - Yao Zhaosheng Lucky to Get the "Most Auspicious" Lottery - People's Representatives Ask for Re-election

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 27th] Zou Zongyi, a senator of Zhongzheng Township, left his post to study in the United States. The vacancy was filled by the county government sending personnel to the township to supervise the election. Yao Zhaosheng and Yu Kuifang each received four votes, making it difficult to decide. Finally, the person in charge came up with a strange idea, taking a divine lottery that the people prayed for in the temple. The lottery was drawn with "most auspicious" being elected and "least auspicious" being eliminated. As a result of the lottery, Yao Zhaosheng got the "most auspicious" lottery. The township's people's representatives believe that using a divine lottery to determine the election is not explicitly stipulated by law, and they have filed a request with the county government for a re-election.

Youth are full of passion. I hope that the nation's youth will channel their passion into constructive efforts. Youth are also the most capable of using reason. Youth must develop their reason, distinguish between right and wrong, because the future of the country depends on the wise choices of the youth. On ordinary days, the harmony of emotions and reason is very important for the youth. Today, to undertake arduous tasks, this kind of harmony is even more essential."

### True Beauty and Good Education and Modern Youth: In Celebration of the 37th Youth Day

— Gu Yuxiu

When a culture reaches its completion, society lacks imagination. Rigidity, repetition, and a decline in brilliant appreciation gradually emerge, with everything conforming to convention. Orthodox schools suppress "adventure."

In this transformation of culture, how can we reverse its decline? Professor Whitehead solemnly warned in advance: "Only when thought runs ahead of facts can the transformation of a new culture arrive quickly. National vitality advances to the adventure of imagination, and can anticipate practical adventures. Humanity dreams of the world to come, and perhaps it will be realized in time."

Culture (or civilization) represents an ideal of life, which is related to the individual and also to the group (human society). For the past six centuries, European culture has followed in the footsteps of its predecessors. The golden ages of Greece and Rome have been the standards of civilization. The present world is advancing towards a new stage of existence. New knowledge and new technologies have changed the proportions of things. The ideals particular to ancient society were too "static," neglecting the opportunities of the entire series. It is not enough to pay attention only to the best famous sayings and greatest successes of ancient times. The result of imitating the ancients is stagnation, repression, and a psychological habit of decline. In fact, the Greeks of that time were not static. Compared to their contemporaries, they did not worship history. They imagined, they adventured, they loved novelty. If we were to do something most contrary to the spirit of the Greeks, it would be to copy everything Greek. The ancient Greeks were never copyists.

From sociological research or an understanding of life, we must note: Perfection is impossible to maintain through stasis. Advancement or decay is the only path available to humanity.

Culture (or civilization), according to the modern great scholar Professor Whitehead—who may be the greatest philosopher of this era, who passed away on December 30th of last year—in the fourth part of his book "Adventures of Ideas," includes "Truth," "Beauty," "Adventure," "Art," and "Peace." "Truth" is the consistency between "Appearance" and "Reality." "Beauty" is the completion of "Harmony," and harmony is the completion of the "Subjective Form" in its detail and synthesis. The subjective form must have "Strength"; there are two conditions for strength: massiveness and intensity. Destruction also has intense emotions, but it violates the principles of harmony. The concept of "Beauty" is broader than that of "Truth," but "Truth" can promote beauty. "Good" and "Evil" are not the purpose of art; they are only related to worldly affairs. When the world is beautiful, it is also good. Science and art are intentional pursuits of "Truth" and "Beauty."

Looking at the sages throughout history, they all pursued a complete life of truth, goodness, and beauty. They are the best examples of education in truth, goodness, and beauty. They not only had abundant knowledge but also transcendent wisdom. They not only established themselves but also established others; they not only saved people but also saved the world; they not only strived for social justice but also sought the common good of the world; they not only served the masses but also sought the great unity of mankind. "To hear the Tao in the morning, and to die in the evening, one is content," is to advance to a realm beyond the ordinary and enter the realm of sainthood. Whether it is truth, morality, or art, the extreme of beauty is holiness, and there is no holiness that is not beautiful. Supreme holiness is supreme beauty, and it possesses supreme emotion. Supreme beauty creates the solemnity of the universe, and supreme emotion gives rise to human universal love.

Modern youth should shoulder the important responsibility of reversing cultural decline, and education in truth, beauty, and goodness is a great force for saving the world from declining trends.

### General Prices: Reduced Inflow of Speculative Capital Slows Price Inflation

The dramatic price fluctuations after the Lunar New Year reached their peak in the second week of this month, that is, three weeks ago. In that week, the general index seen in the wholesale price index compiled by this association rose by 28.6% compared to the previous week. Among the classified indexes, food, textiles, and building materials all rose by more than 32%. In the previous week and last week, the inflationary trend gradually slowed down. The general price index rose by 6% in the previous week. Among the classified indexes, chemical products, which are mostly imported goods, rose more, perhaps due to the special impact of foreign exchange adjustments, but it was still only 28.8%. Last week, the general index rose by only 4.4%. Among the classified indexes, building materials and metals rose faster, while food and textiles, which are more closely related to people's livelihoods, rose less.

There are many reasons for the slowdown in price inflation in the past two weeks. The more important ones are as follows: First, the soaring prices in Shanghai after the Lunar New Year resulted in a gap that was too large compared to the interior. As a result, a large amount of speculative capital flowed from Shanghai to the interior, especially to Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, causing the soaring prices in various places in Chongqing and Kunming in the past two weeks, while Shanghai felt a shortage of funds in the market due to the outflow of speculative capital in the short term. Second, the recent reversal of the war situation in Northeast and North China has promoted a large outflow of industrial equipment and market funds from Shanghai to the south. The southward escape of funds can be seen from the recent increase in exchange rates in various parts of South China. This point naturally has an important relationship with the tightening of funds in this city. Third, speculative capital from Northeast and North China often flows into this city through the method of travelers from the above-mentioned places carrying cash to Shanghai. Recently, due to the increasingly intense war situation in the above-mentioned places, traffic has been blocked, and the number of ships coming south has decreased in the past two weeks, so there is one less source of speculative capital in this city. Fourth, the government recently decided to forcibly collect special relief donations, which has a stimulus effect on wealthy households with fixed assets and hoarding goods. Because fixed assets and hoarding goods are easily inspected, many are sold to exchange for financial items that are easy to hide. This point has a considerable impact on the increase in the supply of goods in the market. Fifth, the dramatic price fluctuations after the Lunar New Year naturally increased the amount of chips required for transactions, thus relatively making funds feel tight.

As a result of the combination of the above various reasons, funds continued the general trend of the previous week and felt tight last week, only slightly turning gentle at the weekend. This point is quite similar to the change in the tightness of funds in the previous week. Funds were tighter at the beginning of last week, and prices generally fell compared to the end of the previous week, especially textiles. The prices of some goods reached their lowest on Wednesday and Thursday. For example, 20-count Double Horse yarn was as low as 100 million yuan per piece, and 42-count Blue Phoenix was as low as 170 million. White japonica rice was as low as 3.6 million per stone. However, near the weekend, funds loosened, and prices rose again. 42-count Blue Phoenix reached 210 million again on Saturday. 20-count Double Horse was as high as 126 million. Longtou fine cloth rose even faster, returning to the peak of 4.4 million. White japonica wheat flour was no higher than in the previous weeks. Among fuels, the source of coal was more abundant and the season had passed. Among chemical products, such as 693 vulcanized yuan, the price was relatively stable due to seasonal reasons. The former, such as Jiaozuo lump coal, stabilized at 14 million per ton, and the latter, such as vulcanized yuan, stabilized at 52 million per barrel, with very little fluctuation, which are a small number of more special goods among all goods.

The wholesale price indexes classified by use last week were as follows:

Category Name Index Last Week Percentage Change from Previous Week

Food Category 350,707 Up 7.6

Textile Category 539,228 Up 6.3

Metal Category 458,722 Up 12.5

### Currency and Finance

(1) Informal Interest Rates

Generally speaking, funds in this city were extremely tight last week. Businesses lacking funds were forced to sell in order to raise funds, resulting in generally weak prices and high informal interest rates. Cash chips were extremely scarce in the first half of the week due to more outflow than inflow. On Monday, bills were not cleared until 1:00 AM, which shows the tightness of funds. However, after Wednesday, first, foreign speculative funds continued to arrive, and second, the exchange difference between the national banks and bureaus turned from inflow to outflow after deducting the fixed deposits of commercial banks, which increased the supply of chips in the market, and interbank lending also became more flexible. The tight situation of funds slightly eased, and although a glimmer of hope was revealed for the return of tightness to looseness in the second half of the week, the large-scale advance of national banks and bureaus did not lead to a sharp decline in prices, so funds were still generally in demand, and the interest rates for securities intermediaries were even as high as 40% or more.

On Monday and Tuesday of last week, the actual inflow of funds from national banks and bureaus was more than 200 billion. After Wednesday, it turned into an outflow. The actual outflow on Friday reached 218.3 billion, setting the highest record for the outflow of national banks and bureaus in half a month.

The amount of difference inflow from foreign banks can also be said to be unprecedented. In the five days from Monday to Friday, the total difference inflow was 640 billion, with an average daily difference inflow of more than 100 billion. Among them, in addition to a part of the funds being recovered from interbank lending, the surging southward flow of speculative capital is also noteworthy.

The shortage of funds in commercial banks and firms has been quite common this week. The difference outflow of banks and firms after the 60th account was nearly 2 trillion in the five days from Monday to Friday, with an average daily outflow of more than 300 billion. The number of commercial banks turning in cash to the Central Bank to offset orders was very small this week, with an average of only 40-50 billion per day. The scarcity of cash chips can be seen from this.

Informal interest rates maintained a high level throughout last week and did not fall. The lowest was 33%, 34.5% was the most common, and 36% was the highest. Securities arbitrage was as high as 45%, while the general rate was around 40%. The interest rate for securities intermediaries was stable at a permanent level of 36%.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

The benchmark rate for foreign exchange transactions remained unchanged last week. The exchange rate was 255,000 yuan, and the pound arbitrage rate was 765,000 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was flat and weak in the first half of the week, maintaining between 1.023 yuan per Hong Kong dollar. It lengthened to 1.27 yuan on Thursday, and slightly shrank on Friday.

Domestic exchange rates of commercial banks in this city generally decreased last week. The Guangzhou exchange rate was 300 yuan per thousand yuan on Monday, and it has fallen to 120 yuan on Friday. The trend of the Xiamen exchange rate was also the same. It was 300 yuan on Monday, fell to 200 yuan on Tuesday, and then fell to 180 yuan on Friday. The Chongqing exchange rate was the highest at 30 yuan per thousand yuan on Monday and Wednesday, and it had fallen to 10 yuan on Friday. Although the Wuhan exchange rate once rose from 110 yuan on Monday to 200 yuan on Tuesday, it has since declined repeatedly and fell to 100 yuan on Friday. The Tianjin discount increased alone. It was 30 yuan per thousand yuan discount on Monday and had increased to 50 yuan on Friday, indicating the trend of funds flowing in from the north.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

Before Thursday of last week, the stock market generally showed a consistent downward trend. In the financial world, on the one hand, it was stimulated by the prospect of the US loan being passed. On the other hand, the funds in the market were extremely tight. Although many optimistic people believed that the agricultural loan issuance and industrial loan success were imminent, and that funds would soon loosen, this optimistic atmosphere ultimately could not withstand the shortness of the available chips. Therefore, under helplessness, many had to sell and exchange for funds. Retail investors in the market were also willing to participate in arbitrage in order to receive interest of 40% or more. With more supply than demand, the stock market naturally declined. However, this phenomenon was still short-lived. The trend of funds had already eased in the second half of the week. Whether the release of agricultural loans could avoid becoming speculative capital was quite questionable. In addition, the settlement period for the second phase of short-term treasury bills had arrived. Therefore, the stock market would return to its good path after Friday. Chinese stocks, such as Yongsheng, opened at 1860 yuan on Monday. By the morning session on Thursday, it had fallen to 1650 yuan. During the same period, the difference between the prices of Xinguang was 246 and 222, the difference between the prices of Jingfu was 244 and 221, and the difference between the prices of Xinyi was 300 and 220. However, the market turned from weak to strong in the afternoon of Thursday. In the afternoon session of Friday, the spot price of Yongsheng had returned to the over-1700 yuan price. The closing prices of Xinguang, Jingfu, and other stocks in the afternoon of Friday were not far from the closing prices on Monday. It seems that this situation will continue for a period of time!

The buying price of foreign stocks such as Huayi yarn was 1.93 million on Monday morning, but it had fallen to 1.65 million on Thursday afternoon. Jardine Matheson fell from 5 million to 4.2 million during the same period. British-American Tobacco was 2.69 million on Monday, but it was only 2.3 million on Thursday afternoon. However, like Chinese stocks, it returned to a high price on Friday. Huayi yarn reached 1.81 million in the afternoon, British-American Tobacco 2.48 million, and Jardine Matheson rose to 4.75 million, seemingly catching up with its buying price at the beginning of the week. The easing of funds and the tightening of the Hong Kong exchange rate had a great impact.

### Business & Industry Trends

Import "Relaxation" or "Restriction"

Regarding the import of raw materials for export products, the Export Control Board (輸管會) convened relevant industries starting from the 3rd of last month for daily consultations. A total of 32 industries were summoned, and the meetings concluded on the 20th of this month. It is understood that for the manufacturing raw materials needed by most manufacturers for export, applications can now be submitted according to import procedures. If the total value of the manufacturing raw materials requested for import does not exceed 40% of the total value of their finished product exports, it can be approved in advance. However, a condition is attached that manufacturers must settle the full amount of the total export value with designated banks when purchasing import foreign exchange. This shows that the government's ultimate goal is still to further obtain foreign exchange reserves. As for industries unrelated to foreign exchange earnings, whether their raw material quotas are sufficient, or even not allocated at all, the authorities often pay little attention. This has led to the Shanghai Oils Association (油脂公會) and the Guolian Kerosene Factory (國煉火油廠) making accusatory appeals due to the insufficient allocation of diesel fuel for refining kerosene. Last Tuesday, the Association hosted the press, criticizing the Export Control Board for neglecting the fact that diesel fuel is essential for kerosene refining, and stated that since Guolian Kerosene relies entirely on diesel fuel as raw material, and diesel fuel is managed and controlled by the Export Control Board, the failure to approve allocation contradicts the Ministry of Economic Affairs' stated policy of support. In addition to this, last week, the enamelware industry also appealed for increased quotas and reduced prices for raw materials to maintain production. In short, the authorities are now suppressing so-called unnecessary imports, which in reality are imports that cannot generate more foreign exchange. For imported materials essential for people's livelihoods and industries, they are trying every possible means to use control mechanisms to grasp these materials or the commodities made from them. To achieve this goal, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently tasked the Industrial and Commercial Counseling Department (工商輔導處) with formulating an opinion on how to control industrial product prices. The proposed opinion believes that to control the price of finished products, a general material warehouse should be established, with the government centrally purchasing necessary raw materials domestically and abroad, to be allocated to various private industrial factories. Then, through order-based loans, physical objects would be loaned, and finished products purchased. In this way, the government can also control a batch of materials through centralized raw material purchases.

Under the two principles of requiring a guarantee from a designated bank for exporters and applicants to settle 40% of the total export value in advance, the import of manufacturing raw materials for export products has begun to be applied for and reviewed. The International Trade Promotion Association (國際貿易促進會) is preparing for further plans. Last Wednesday, the Association held a symposium and planned to draft a letter to the Export Control Board, requesting that general export goods such as raw materials and agricultural by-products also be handled with preferential treatment according to the industrial product raw material import method. However, according to reports, the authorities believe that although the request for agricultural products to be handled according to the industrial product raw material import method is reasonable, the current government situation does not allow it. The key issue is obviously whether subsidizing the export of agricultural products can generate sufficient foreign exchange. Moreover, the government's soon-to-be-implemented method of purchasing seven export commodities is already sufficient to solve this problem—obtaining foreign exchange!

Another example of import restrictions is the method of restricting the import of chemical products passed by the National Economic Council (全經會) last Thursday. The original proposal was that the import quota of chemical raw materials would be approved according to the examination opinion, that is, in principle, 19 categories that can be self-produced will not be included, and 9 categories that can be gradually manufactured will be reclassified into Appendix 3 (A) and their import volume will be reduced.

The "Luck" and "Misfortune" of Production Loans

Regarding the quantity and allocation of this year's production loans, this newspaper has provided many comprehensive reports in previous issues. This column pointed out in the last issue that among all loans, agricultural loans are the most favored, with grain production loans totaling 5 trillion and cotton production loans totaling 3 trillion, accounting for more than half of the total loan amount. The purpose of this huge amount of agricultural loans, in addition to the so-called increase in production, is probably to control agricultural product materials. For example, at the Farmers Bank of China (農民銀行) administrative meeting, in addition to deciding that the total loan amount for this month would be 1,475 billion, it was further stipulated that fertilizer and seeds would be loaned in kind, and the rest would be loaned in cash in principle. In addition, it is said that to take charge of the materials on behalf of the government, agricultural warehouses will be established in grain and cotton production areas to handle the storage and mortgage of agricultural products. According to the person in charge of the Central Cooperative Treasury (中央合作金庫), the 3 trillion agricultural loans allocated to the Treasury will still follow the guidelines approved by the United Office of the Four Banks (四聯總處), focusing on grain and cotton, and fertilizers, silk, and water conservancy will all be loaned in kind. For fertilizers and silk, it is also planned to recover the physical objects. Fertilizers will be loaned with bean cakes and rice will be recovered. Silk will be loaned seeds first, and in the future, 60% will be recovered in kind and 40% in cash. It can be seen that a large part of these 60% of loans will be recovered in kind in the future. Such a subtle and complex lending process is indeed, as the general manager of the China Farmers Bank (中農) said in his written statement on this year's agricultural loan policy, "easily criticized." At the same time, except for a few people, probably everyone hopes that this agricultural loan can indeed, as Mr. Li declared, "reach individual farmers through farmers' organizations, and cannot be like urban capital, having an adverse impact on prices!"

Although agricultural loans have already been settled, the detailed rules for export loans are still under discussion. According to the Import and Export Association (進出會), first, the government stipulates that the loan amount is based on the past export volume, but the government is now planning to expand my country's export trade, and the loan amount is based on the past export volume, which inevitably limits the expansion of exporters' business. Second, the loan amount is settled once a month, and it is stipulated that one-tenth of the loan amount is settled monthly, which lacks flexibility and cannot match the seasonality of export commodity sales, so it is hoped that the authorities will revise it.

The opening of export channels has indeed shown some promise, but whether industrial loans will be opened is still without news. According to a spokesperson for the Industrial Association (工協), since the end of last year, factories in various industries, except for the textile industry, have been increasingly entering a difficult situation. According to his estimation, about 30% of factories are in a state of shutdown for various reasons, resulting in a decrease of about 40% in the production of general daily necessities compared to the past, which is also one of the reasons for the soaring prices.

Japan's Revival is China's Mortal Enemy

While most of the people in our country are still struggling on the brink of starvation, a large amount of soybeans will be shipped to Japan to relieve the Japanese famine. According to a special dispatch from the Central News Agency (中央社) in Tokyo on the 22nd, two Chinese ships carrying 32,000 tons of soybeans, bean cakes, and peanuts are scheduled to depart from Central and North China for Japan recently. Among them, one will carry 14,000 tons of miscellaneous grains (mostly purchased from Hankou) from Shanghai to Japan, and the other will carry 18,000 tons of soybeans from Northeast China from Tianjin to Japan. This coincides with the news reported by the same agency on the 23rd that under the US policy, an agricultural China and an industrial Japan are being formed again. It is said that the United States may provide Japan with loans totaling 765 million US dollars in July when the next fiscal year begins. It is also learned that the United States is currently considering a plan to restore the Japanese economy to the level of 1934, and the production target for 1948 is set to reach 36 million tons of coal and 1 million tons of steel. Therefore, it is no wonder that Kazuo Ishikawa, chairman of the joint meeting of important Japanese banks, and Kiichiro Sato, vice chairman of the Federation of Industrial Organizations, have dared to express the opinion that they will be able to get rid of foreign capitalists' control over Japanese industry in the future.

That post-war Japan will once again pose a threat to our country can not only be seen in MacArthur's policies, but also in Japan's recent inroads into the international market. According to a magnate in the export industry, when talking about the current situation of the Aden cloth market, Japan has entered the international trade stage, and it is inevitable that it will dump a large amount of cloth to the Near East in the future. According to a telegram from Xinhua News Agency (新亞社) in Tokyo on the 22nd, the export of silk fabrics, which account for a large proportion of textiles, has gradually increased in January, February, and March. So far, the most export destinations are New York, followed by Honolulu. Recently, 31,653 pieces have also been exported to Singapore. According to unofficial statistics, the amount of Japanese goods shipped to Hong Kong in the past six months is more than to any other place, and the ratio compared with Singapore is 30 to 1. Of this huge amount of Japanese goods imported, Hong Kong sells only about 80%, and the rest is transshipped to various parts of Southeast Asia. Yuan Liang, chairman of the Yarn Control Board (紗管會), also pointed out when meeting with reporters last Wednesday that in a month, Japanese cloth will be massively dumped in Southeast Asia. It can be seen that the situation is already serious enough.

### Steel Industry's Perspective in the Northern Flames of War

The production of iron ore in our country reaches a huge amount of 2,257,000 tons annually in the Northeast, and the total of other provinces is less than half of it. Before the war, 90% of the iron ore produced was exported to Japan. Steelmaking with iron is also centered in the Northeast, especially the Anshan Iron and Steel Company (鞍山鋼鐵公司) in the Northeast, which has the largest scale. Before the war, the annual steel production was 530,000 tons. During the occupation, the Japanese stepped up production and exceeded one million tons. Its equipment, such as the 400-ton smelting furnace, the 100-ton open-hearth steelmaking furnace, and all the steel rolling equipment, are extremely valuable. In contrast, the steel production of other provinces is quite poor, and the statistics that can be obtained are as follows:

(Unit: tons)

Hubei 216,000

Anhui 120,000

Hunan 240,000

Shanxi 32,000

Guangdong 80,000

Sichuan 108,000

Guizhou 120,000

Yunnan 56,000

The total is less than one million tons. Now that Anshan has been lost, we can only strengthen the construction of poor areas. Therefore, Central and South China have regained favor. The Qijiang Electrochemical Smelting Plant (綦江電化冶煉廠) in Sichuan will use the complete set of equipment of the Ziyang Iron Smelting Plant's (資渝煉鐵廠) 15-ton iron smelting furnace to resume iron production. The quality of iron ore on Hainan Island is excellent. Last year, a barter trade agreement was signed with Japan for a total of 200,000 tons, which was shipped out last month. Weng Wenhao, chairman of the Resources Committee (資源委員會), also flew to Guangdong to plan to set up a steel plant in Guangzhou to utilize the iron ore from Hainan. The Hubei Daye (湖北大治) has established the Preparatory Office of the Central China Iron and Steel Company (華中鋼鐵公司籌備處), preparing to use Japanese war reparations equipment to build a new plant within the year, and to assemble small-scale steel equipment with the existing machinery and materials, aiming to start production in the second half of the year to supply the needs of the Central China region. In addition, in Shanghai, there is the Shanghai Company, whose steelmaking part started construction in June last year. It has been eight months now, and it is said that the total production has reached 1,000 tons. The estimated national steel industry output for this year is 300,000 tons of iron ore, 46,000 tons of pig iron, and 16,000 tons of steel products. The output is very small, and because of the depletion of foreign exchange, imports from abroad are difficult, so there is no problem with sales. Raw materials are also mostly waste steel and scrap iron, so there is no shortage of them. The only difficulty is fuel.

### Ministry of Finance Formulates Five Measures to Prevent Suspected Fraudulent Remittances

In order to prevent domestic remittances handled by various banks and firms from containing false or fictitious names and addresses of remitters and payees, the Ministry of Finance has formulated measures to be notified to various banks. The measures are as follows:

(1) When handling domestic remittances, whether by mail, draft, or telegraphic transfer, all banks and firms should request the remitter to fill in the true names (or the full names of institutions, companies, and manufacturers) and detailed addresses of the remitter and payee in the remittance application form.

(2) If the payee of a telegraphic transfer is replaced by a telegraphic code or the corresponding account number of the paying bank or firm, the remitter should still be requested to specify the original name and address of the payee so that it can be recorded in the remittance account. For drafts, if the remitter requests to issue a blank payee draft, the remitter should also be requested to fill in the name and address of the payee as the basis for accounting.

(3) For all remittances left for collection by the paying bank or firm (including remittances left for the payee to collect, remittances collected on behalf of the paying bank, and remittances of the nature of traveler's checks), the remitter should be requested to specify the reason why the address of the left-behind and the payee has not yet been determined, and the accepting bank should also note the reason in the account book.

(4) Except for interbank transfers, public fund transfers by military and government agencies, and fund transfers by local product, public utility, and transportation institutions, which should be handled by the institution or enterprise, for ordinary customer remittances, if the amount exceeds 200 million yuan per transaction, the paying bank should require the payee to provide a substantial guarantee before payment is allowed. If payment is made without a guarantee, and it is found that the name of the payee is false and the address is incorrect, the remitting and paying bank or firm shall be responsible.

(5) If banks and firms violate the above provisions, the Ministry of Finance will, depending on the severity of the circumstances, impose sanctions in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Business.

### Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange Imported Paper to be Supplied to the Market Soon

Totaling More Than 7,000 Tons

The authorities have almost completed the processing of imported materials with self-prepared foreign exchange. Among them, there are various types of paper, which are quite large in number, reaching more than 7,000 tons, 90% of which are Canadian and Swedish newsprint. Paper merchants have already been rushing to handle purchase procedures, and the market demand can be met in the shortest time. According to paper merchants, the recent decline in paper prices is due to the above-mentioned stimulus. It is predicted that after the increase in supply, paper prices may continue to fall sharply.

### Observations on the Indian Scientific Community

— Translated by Yang Shi

India and China are both ancient Eastern countries that have contributed brilliant cultures to the world in the past. Today, both of these independent Eastern powers are absorbing Western civilization and engaging in scientific development. Due to historical reasons, India started earlier than us, but it still has many shortcomings. The stones from other hills can be used to polish jade. The situation of the Indian scientific community can serve as a lesson for us. This article is the most candid and sincere critique of the Indian scientific community published by Dr. Albert F. Blackeslee after a two-month tour in India. It also has value for alerting and guiding the Chinese scientific community. It is specially translated for our readers, with notes from the translator.

This is a report I personally wrote after attending the Indian Science Congress in Delhi in the winter of 1947 (i.e., January and February). Scientists from various countries attended the conference. The American side included Dr. W.E. Deming, Dr. H. Shapley, representing the American Association for the Advancement of Science (A.A.A.S.), and the author. In addition, there were three representatives from Canada, nine from the United Kingdom, two from the Soviet Union, one from France, and one from China (Dr. Chen Xingshen). Besides attending the Delhi Congress, we also visited universities and scientific laboratories in many major cities in India, including Winnipeg, Lahore, Benares, Calcutta, Madras, Karachi, and Bombay. I don't want to write this report in detail, but only share some personal impressions from my hurried visits with American scientists.

Although it only took us a short thirty-four hours to fly from the United States to India, their customs and religions were very far from what we left behind. There are many surprising differences on this land, such as climate, ethnicity, language, religion, and the form of government. In our opinion, there is a huge disparity between the poverty of the common people and the enjoyment and luxury of the upper classes. We found many common people sleeping on the streets or on the stone steps of Delhi's greatest mosque because they were too poor to have any other place to stay; but later, the luxury of the banquet at the Governor's Mansion in New Delhi surprised an American. At the tables of many wealthy industrialists, you could drink many precious wines and champagnes. In fact, whether Indian or British, the people we representatives contacted at the conference were all academics and some members of the ruling class. The truly poor Indians had little opportunity to be contacted.

This science conference was also divided into several groups for discussion, much like the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The enthusiasm of the discussions and the vividness of the criticisms made us deeply feel that Indians have made great progress in science. Although India has hundreds of different languages and dialects, the entire venue was controlled by English, which must have surprised some Americans. The languages of northern India mostly evolved from ancient Aryan languages, while the Dravidian languages of southern India evolved from another ancient language. Thus, English has become the common language for educated Indians. Except for two Islamic universities, all higher education institutions teach in English. It can also be seen from here that a universal language is of great benefit to the transmission of science. Although a large proportion of people can speak Hindi, there are many Indian universities where professors are engaged in finding a national language that can be used throughout India to replace English; perhaps this is due to their excessive national consciousness and therefore want to break off all relations with Britain.

Indians have given us many novel experimental methods, but unfortunately, these have not been valued by other nations. For example, an outstanding female botanist, when discussing the utilization of seaweed, declared that their efforts in this area were no less than those of the United States. Every farmer has a fish pond, and after adding a certain chemical substance, it stimulates the growth of seaweed, allowing the fish to grow quickly. Every American scientist has heard of this, but so far, we have not done it that way. Indians all believe that everything in America is replaced by machines instead of manual labor, but they do not understand how expensive manual labor is in America, while in India, manual labor is the cheapest and there are the most workers.

Indian university students and young scientific workers mostly hope to study in the United States. We are often surrounded by requests to help them enter American universities. Some even boldly visit us before breakfast to make the same request. One student, only fifteen years old, declared that he hoped to come to the United States to study atomic physics.

Politically, Indians are very concerned about all of America's domestic and foreign policies. Nehru, at a dinner party he hosted for Dr. Shapley and me (accompanied by two Indian scientists), expressed a great need to know some of the attitudes of American foreign policy, especially regarding the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. He was even more concerned about the role of the Republican victory in Congress in 1946 on this policy. Nehru's keen interest and understanding of other countries, as well as his great achievements in improving the lives of the Indian people, were very moving to us. Almost all people of all classes want to learn from the United States, but they do not want Westerners to treat them as inferior races as objects of charity. They hate the "sense of national superiority" of some Western whites in South Africa and India the most; in retaliation for South Africa's discrimination against Indians, they have announced a boycott of South African goods imports. A sign saying "South Africans not allowed" was posted at the entrance of a hotel in Bombay.

In fact, both Indians and British are relying on the United States. In January and February 1947, when the British government had not yet decided on the date of withdrawal from India, many British officials were already panicking. They believed that the Indians would soon take their place; some British hoped that the United States could morally assist India so that she could stand on her own.

India once had a culture that made them proud, its antiquity can be traced back to the ancient Aryan era. The Vedic classics of two thousand years before the Common Era still have valuable literary value. Before I went to India, when I talked to British officials, I thought that the Indian nation was a nation of low intelligence, but after my visit, I completely changed my original view, and also saw that the British said that the Indian nation was incompetent and had ulterior motives. Indian scholars know that they need to learn science and technology from the West, but this learning is due to the compulsion of objective circumstances, not subjective initiative, so the change is quite timid.

In my conversations with many Indian scholars, I pointed out that in the first one or two decades of this century, the United States had to learn from Europe, especially from Germany, which was a leader in science, but not long ago, Americans had realized that this did not take much time. Similarly, today India needs to learn from the West and send a large number of students to receive the baptism of science. Regardless of whether the colonial policy that the British Empire used to implement in India should be condemned and cursed, their contribution to the development of Indian science is indelible, especially in . Many British scientists I met did devote most of their lives to the progress of Indian science, but when Britain was about to withdraw from India, some had to leave India to seek jobs in other countries. We always hope that the cause they have devoted themselves to will not be completely abandoned because of this, and that under the efforts of the Indians themselves, its level can be further improved.

The British often say that Indian scientists have great success in theoretical physics and mathematics. Although Raman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics, is indeed an outstanding experimentalist, there is still some truth in this. They are not very good at some experimental work, but the enthusiastic research spirit of some experimental workers is admirable. I found that the biggest shortcoming of Indian scientists is that they are unwilling to use their hands, a shortcoming that scientists in other countries often commit. This lack of recognition of the sacredness of manual labor and the strict social class system—which is now slowly decreasing—has been a great obstacle to their scientific and technological progress. I met a consultant for science and engineering in a certain province who told me that when he was studying at a polytechnic university in the United States, he had to do more than other students. During the summer vacation, he worked hard to earn tuition, and sometimes went to restaurants to wash dishes. But when he happily wrote these things to his parents, he immediately received two sea telegrams ordering him to stop doing this, because it would insult their noble family. He also told me that he had used 1,200 rupees per month (equivalent to 400 US dollars) to hire an engineer, but this person only wanted to sit at a desk all day long. If he asked him to go to the factory to actually operate, he would refuse. In my conversation with them, I said that I sometimes helped my wife wash dishes at home, which is a valuable thing. Using your hands to work is really the best homework. If Indian scientists come to visit the United States, they will learn this valuable spirit from American scientists.

An American vice-consul stationed in India told me that an event can illustrate the difference between American scientists and Indian scientists. When an American receives a Doctor of Philosophy degree, that is only the starting point of his life's career, but when an Indian receives a Doctor of Philosophy degree, it seems that it is the end point of his work because he feels that he has reached the goal he has been pursuing. Once an Indian scholar has secured a university professorship, he stops all scientific pursuits. They believe that a person's position is far more important than the work itself. Those who are truly engaged in the most basic experiments and research at the university cannot approach us to discuss their research experience. In fact, I found that they were forced to stay away from us. In many of my lectures, I suggested that exchanging ideas is the most necessary for progress.

Recently, I received a letter from an Indian student. The matter is like this: the Indian government is preparing to send several graduate students studying for a doctorate to study at the Institute of Biology, Smith College, in the United States. The list was announced, and he was not admitted. He asked me to write a letter to the Indian government asking them to reconsider their decision; in the letter, he implied that this matter would have a great and important impact on him. We often hear them complain that because of personal relationships or political reasons, most of the students sent out by India are not the most outstanding students, etc. We cannot judge whether this accusation is true or just resentment after not being admitted; but fundamentally, I have never written a letter of request for them.

I would very much like to be a chieftain (Manaraja) of an Indian princely state, not because he would have amazing wealth, countless wives, and a highly life of enjoyment, but because his power and financial resources could enable Indian science and technology to make rapid progress and use science to improve people's living standards. We feel that in India, whether public or private donations for public welfare undertakings need to be promoted very much. Fortunately, we visited several scientific institutions that were either entirely or partially funded by private donations; such as the Bose Institute for Plant Research in Calcutta and the Tata Hospital in Bombay. We also attended the donation ceremony of the Sirila Duke Industrial College during the conference, but such institutions are very few. There are not many large industrialists in India to begin with, and the wealthy simply do not have the habit of donating money to start scientific and educational undertakings.

Many distinguished Indians have titles given to them by the British Empire, but there is a common view that this is just a way to express one's loyalty to the British royal family with money. If I were an Indian government official, I would definitely abolish these titles and peerages and replace them with Indian-based titles. I suggest adopting the title "Indian Benefactor" (Inaian Benefactor) to those who donate money to promote art, literature, science, and philosophy; this is like the Nobel Prize, not with a wider scope. An Indian would feel greatly honored to add the letters "I.B" after his name. (I.B. are the initials of Incian Benefacor, not B.I because this is confused with "British Incia.") The names still follow Indian customs, and then we hear Ishaad Benefactor instead of Sir John and other English names. It is more honorable to encourage wealthy people to donate money to improve the welfare of their compatriots than to offer it to the British royal family!

I am so frankly criticizing many shortcomings of the Indian scientific community, but in fact, the American academic community also often commits them. After I traveled back to China, I felt that our Indian scientific friends have the highest sincerity and perseverance, and at the same time, I firmly believe that India is a place with great potential. Their scientists and university students value our visits and lectures very much. Personally, I learned more from there than I contributed to them. This kind of visit is not only beneficial to scientific colleagues in India and the United States, but also can enhance mutual understanding between countries. There is only one science in the world, it does not distinguish national boundaries, and mutual observation and exchange between scientists from various countries is the most necessary and most beneficial.

Regarding the status of Indian science, there are very few documents in our country. As far as the translator knows, Professor Liu Cheng, the editor of this journal, has written a book "Indian Science," which is published by Zhengzhong Book Company. It describes the history of Indian scientific development, the current situation, and scientific institutions and famous scientists in detail, which can be used as a reference.

### The Spiral Nebula and the Stars

### Panoramic View of Wilson Peak's Heavenly Terrace

### Scientific Chats Starry Sky Chats

— Pan Chenglie

On a clear night without moonlight, looking up at the starry sky full of stars, this glittering and magnificent spectacle will make people shudder and feel how insignificant mankind is. People who gaze at the stars mostly wonder about the mechanism and what exactly is revealed by these stars; more people are moved by the beauty of these celestial bodies.

It seems that there are millions of stars visible to the naked eye. In fact, because we can only see half of the sky at a time (the other half is on the far side of the earth), we can only see at most 3,500 stars without the help of optical instruments.

With a good pair of binoculars, this number can be increased to 120,000. The 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson can see about 1.5 billion stars. There are still countless more that are too far away to be detected by any instrument.

For many years, stars have been the guides and friends of sailors, shepherds, and camel herders, so the Greeks, Romans, and Arabs gave beautiful names to those more prominent constellations. Polaris, Altair in Aquila, and Arcturus in Bootes are shining poetically. With a little practice and using a star chart as a guide, these and hundreds of other individual stars can be easily identified in the sky with the naked eye and distinguished by their color and size.

The Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy divided the brightness of stars into six magnitudes. The faintest star visible to the naked eye is the sixth magnitude; a star 2.5 times brighter is the fifth magnitude, and so on, until the dazzling first magnitude stars such as Sirius, Arcturus, Rigel, and Procyon.

Stars have varying degrees of color, and we can distinguish the red Betelgeuse, the yellow Mira, and the light blue Vega. The changes in star color are due to changes in their temperature. Just like a iron rod heated up, it is initially dark red, then turns yellow as the temperature rises, and then becomes white-hot. So a dark red star, such as Aldebaran, is the least hot, with a surface of about 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit. A yellow star, such as Alpha Librae, is twice as hot. The hottest star in the sky is blue-white, and the surface temperature of Spica in Virgo reaches 36,000 degrees.

Astronomers use a bolometer to measure the temperature of stars, which is an electric meter that exposes a thin platinum strip to the radiant heat of the star and records their surface heat with the finest accuracy. Another type of thermometer for stars, called a thermocouple, is a set of radio vacuum tubes placed at the main focus of the telescope.

When we look at stars, they mostly seem to be the same size, but the variation is actually very large. Some can be measured with an instrument called an Interferometer. In 1920, Professor Megson calculated the diameter of Betelgeuse to be 270 million miles using the diffraction of light and complex mathematics—a monster 30,000 times larger than the diameter of our earth. However, Betelgeuse looks like a dwarf compared to the huge Alpha Herculis, because the latter is so incredibly large that if it were in the position of our sun, it would swallow the earth and extend beyond the orbit of Mars!

Since there are countless such giant stars in the sky, some people may wonder if the sky is too crowded? But as a certain astronomer said: "If you put three wasps in the sky over Europe, then the wasps will be more crowded in the sky over Europe than the stars are in space."

The space between stars is unimaginably vast. The sun (the star at the center of our solar system) is only 93 million miles from the earth, while Pluto, the outermost planet in the solar system, is 4 billion miles from the sun. Beyond that is a huge gap—an abyss of space that effectively isolates our solar system in the universe—until Alpha Centauri, the closest star to us, appears 25 trillion miles away. Sirius is twice as far. Sunlight reaches us in eight minutes, but the light from Sirius takes more than eight years to reach us.

These flickering points of light are just the foreground of the picture that constitutes the universe. Further away, we see a faint pearly band across the sky like a semicircle sprinkled with powder. This is the Milky Way, made up of the light of a trillion stars, so far away that they cannot be separated, plus a huge amount of star dust, which is matter in the embryonic stage, that is, stars that have not yet been born.

Sir James Jeans describes the Milky Way as like the rim of a large cartwheel rotating around a central hub. The center of the wheel is 50,000 light-years away from Earth. Our sun is one of the smaller stars in this system. In this Milky Way galaxy (there are at least 100 million similar galaxies in the universe), our Earth, which we are so proud of, is no more than a small speck of pollen floating on the Pacific Ocean.

But measurable distances are far beyond the Milky Way. The large telescope on Mont Wilson helped astronomers obtain the light of globular clusters, which are clusters of stars like bee swarms, and it takes 18,000 to 184,000 years for their light to reach the Earth. For example, the light emitted by the globular cluster M13 in Hercules around the time when humans first appeared on Earth in the Stone Age only enters the eyes of astronomers today.

If the remoteness of these globular clusters has aroused your imagination, then the greater distance of the so-called "Island Universe" will make this imagination numb. In the depths of distant space, these "nebulae" are rushing towards the edge of the universe at an alarming speed. Professor Shapley of Harvard University proved that the light of the nebula M87 takes eight million years to reach us, but don't forget that light can travel 186,000 miles in one second!

The newly completed 200-inch telescope on top of Mont Paroma in California, USA, cannot, as commonly said, make new discoveries in all aspects. For example, it would be a waste to use this large telescope to observe the moon, because the most effective examples for studying the moon are telescopes of appropriate size, about 6 inches to 20 inches. The main function of this new telescope is to collect light from incredibly distant parts of the universe, increasing our knowledge of space beyond a trillion light-years.

Is the universe closed, with a certain size and limited boundaries? (This statement is based on Einstein's (Einstein) saying that space is curved back to its original place, somewhat like the curvature of the earth's surface,) or as Eddington (Eccington) believed, is it an expanding universe, filled with tens of thousands of galaxies like ours, each continuing to rush towards boundless space at incredible speeds? Are the current stars still in a state of extreme chaos and explosion, where atomic chain reactions change the original matter into heat, light, and electromagnetism? Like our sun (a small star), every second it transforms 4.2 million tons of matter into energy. It is this possible convertibility of matter and energy—published by Einstein in 1905 using a theoretical formula—that gave our physicists the first definite way to know the terrible and infinite power hidden in atoms on the ground.

A star is just a large pile of perpetually exploding atoms. Under the attack of terrible heat at the center, the gas atoms are completely shattered, and the fragments of electrons and nucleons collide in a chaotic manner. But the internal pressure at the center of the star is so terrible that it crushes the shattered atoms together to form matter of incredibly high density—so large that one cubic inch of this matter would weigh several tons. (Compared to these heavy atoms, our seemingly solid earth is only composed of dandelion fluff,) When nuclear physicists split uranium atoms, they only took a tiny fraction of the energy creation process that has always been happening in stars.

In fact, all astronomical observations today are done using photography: faint stars that cannot be seen even with the largest lenses can be recorded on photographic plates exposed for several hours (or days). Changes that the sharpest observer cannot detect can be identified by telescope cameras. Professor Lowell calculated the existence of Pluto, the outermost planet in our solar system, using difficult mathematics, but it took fifteen years of effort and countless photos to find the wandering planet's position in the sky.

With human wisdom, the mystery of the universe is gradually being revealed to us. The progress of science has expanded our view of the universe. In this boundless space, the earth's position is really smaller than a drop in the ocean.

### On the Cultural Atmosphere

— Wu Yong

I, the author, enjoy reading. However, this is merely reading for the sake of reading, without any particular purpose. My ambition is not in applying what I learn, nor do I believe that reading has any mysterious power. My reading is simply a hobby, like smoking. Smoking certainly has no benefits, but not smoking always makes me feel restless. Books are the same to me in this regard.

It's just that in recent years, the situation has been turbulent, and prices have soared, making life a problem for most people. I, naturally, am no exception. Amidst the hardships of life, how can I still enjoy the hobby of reading? Perhaps it's a case of "birds of a feather flock together." Occasionally, I have the chance to meet with a few like-minded friends. Inevitably, we talk about books old and new, discuss recent publications, and look at the colorful books we have read on our bookshelves. In such an atmosphere, my long-diminished interest in reading is rekindled. I feel that reading Chinese and foreign books, old and new, is indeed a pure joy, a great pleasure in life.

If we want to arouse people's interest in reading, the first thing we must consider is whether the person has a propensity for reading. Because everyone has their own personality, which is not easily changed. If someone doesn't have a reading disposition, no matter what methods you use to attract them, I think it will all be in vain. Second, even if someone has a propensity for reading, if they lack a reading environment and opportunities to interact with scholars, their interest in books will be diminished, and they may even develop no fondness for books at all.

Therefore, reading requires the most attention to the atmosphere of reading. Whether cultivating the habit of reading among the general population and creating a strong reading atmosphere in society is beneficial is, of course, difficult to say, but at the very least, it won't have a negative destructive effect. However, the reality is that people today don't pay attention to this point and rarely make an effort. They put all their efforts into destructive endeavors. Consider that even in a civilized country like the United States, people pay tuition to attend university, and university education is not considered compulsory national education. However, in military education, such as at West Point, students not only have their tuition waived from admission to graduation, but also receive free room and board. This shows that the American government also emphasizes military affairs over culture.

Stringfellow Barr, in his book "Let Us Understand Each Other," makes a statement that I consider to be a profound truth. He says, "People are united by hate, not by love." This statement is a distillation of the author's observations of facts throughout history. Many people, upon hearing a bugle call, will raise their arms and eagerly join the military. If a third- or fourth-rate speaker gives a stirring speech, it will surely move the audience to tears or make them applaud and cheer. If a first-rate scholar gives an academic lecture, although some people will go to listen, I fear that few are there for academic reasons, and most are there to satisfy their curiosity. Furthermore, Jesus spent his life preaching the philosophy of love, but he had only a dozen or so disciples, while those who opposed him were in large groups. As a result, Jesus was outnumbered and eventually killed by the group of haters.

It is a great tragedy of mankind that people are easily united by "hate." However, I believe that this is not necessarily due to human nature. Perhaps it has something to do with postnatal education. From ancient times to the present, people have devoted themselves more to destruction. Eventually, one day, they will shift their gaze from "hate" to "love." However, to achieve this goal, we must still rely on people's emphasis on education and the promotion of culture.

To promote culture, we must first create a "cultural atmosphere." There is a passage in Boswell's "Life of Johnson" describing the gatherings of scholars at that time. The strong cultural atmosphere of that group is truly enviable. An excerpt is translated below: "Johnson liked to prop up his feet and pour out his heart. But when he gathered with his articulate friends, his conversation was especially brilliant. In 1764, these friends formed a club, which gradually became a great force in the literary world. The club's reviews of new books would immediately spread throughout London, causing an edition to sell out instantly or causing new publications to be abandoned for use by box makers and pie makers. This is not surprising, as the members of this club were all first-class erudite scholars. For example, Goldsmith was a representative of poetry and light literature; Reynolds was a representative of art; Burke was a representative of political philosophy; in addition, there was the historian Gibbon and the linguistic master Harris. When the famous actor Garrick attended, he always brought endless jokes. Bennet Langton was an authority on Greek literature; Topham Beauclerk was known for his elegant behavior and witty remarks, and he was very knowledgeable about the world of romance. In such a group, it was not easy to lead the crowd, but Johnson was the leader of this group."

Our country's scholars and talented individuals also need such a club. This club can serve as a club for scholars on the one hand, and naturally, it can also achieve the benefits of "pooling wisdom" on the other.

### The "Room" Shortage at Westminster Abbey

— Wu Jiu

Westminster Abbey in London is not only where the royal family holds grand ceremonies, but also where British celebrities are buried. However, the land of Westminster Abbey is limited, while the number of celebrities throughout the ages is endless. As a result, it is also experiencing overcrowding. As early as 1907, the Westminster Abbey authorities stipulated that in the future, each burial would be limited to a bottle of ashes to save space. However, even with this measure, it still cannot accommodate so many celebrities. Anxious, the authorities reviewed the register of "celebrities" buried throughout the abbey, preparing to relocate minor celebrities if necessary to make way for major celebrities. Unexpectedly, the review yielded quite surprising results. It turned out that in this solemn and sacred place, among many wealthy families, literary figures, and scholars, there was also a little-known gatekeeper, a laundress, a lead worker, and a swindler who had been sleeping here for a long time!

### Memorizing the Dictionary

— Nian Hong

There is an extremely common idiom that is widely known: "Constant dripping wears away the stone." It illustrates the truth that perseverance leads to success.

However, any golden rule must be used flexibly. Otherwise, even the Bible can be quoted by the devil. If you stick to the literal meaning, you can easily make a fool of yourself. I remember when I was in middle school, there was an English teacher who was a self-taught and hardworking student. He didn't attend university, but he was quite knowledgeable in English. Even now, I still admire his character and efforts very much. However, I really couldn't praise his teaching methods at the time. It turned out that he taught students to memorize the dictionary after class. According to him, an English-Chinese dictionary with 30,000 to 40,000 words could be memorized completely in five or six years if you memorized 20 words every day, persevered, and didn't interrupt or neglect it. He had done it this way himself and still knew most of it by heart. At that time, some students tried to follow his instructions. I was one of them, but I gave up halfway in less than half a month. None of the other students did any differently than me.

Looking back now, I really find it ridiculous that I used such a stupid method because I lacked guidance. It wasn't entirely my fault, but it was ridiculously pedantic to teach students to do the same. There is no doubt that perseverance can lead to success, but it would be foolish to open a needle factory and use iron rods to grind them into needles. Iron rods can be ground into needles, but wouldn't it be twice as effective to divide the iron rods into small pieces and then grind them?

Because people like to be quick and convenient, scientific methods are invented. It is economical to get the greatest results at the lowest cost. Unnecessary sacrifices are the worst example to follow.

Take war as an example. Even if a lone soldier or a suicide squad can charge into the enemy ranks and strike a blow with courage and ability, the result is still not worthwhile. Either they "die gloriously" or "the entire army is annihilated." No miracles will occur in the 20th century. Especially in modern warfare, the struggle has long since evolved from who has the bigger fist and the stronger arm to a battle of wits between brains. Planning strategies and achieving victory from afar, the simple and primitive methods of battle have long been eliminated. Although we should not fall into the trap of "weapon worship," we should not rely solely on spontaneity in all our estimations.

"The application of blood is like money. Parsimony is unacceptable, but waste is a big miscalculation." We certainly shouldn't cherish ourselves too much, but is it worth undervaluing ourselves, letting time be wasted on trivial matters, and letting life be consumed innocently on ordinary details? A burst of recklessness is certainly indispensable, but we must also know how to use methods to reduce unnecessary losses. Saving time is prolonging one's own life and ability.

However, it is even worse to talk about methods without seeking practical results. If you can talk about theory eloquently but can't move a step when you need to take action, then it's better to charge forward with explosives strapped to you and kill a few enemies than to talk about strategic situations. It's better to memorize a dictionary, which will at least help with English, than to do nothing.

### Two New Disciplines

— Qi Feng

Everyone agrees that we enter university to seek advanced knowledge and research opportunities. However, although the pursuit of knowledge is the biggest reason for entering university, guidance and discussion on the issues of life and cultivation that young people need are equally important. Unfortunately, universities have overlooked this importance.

The faculty of Shanghai University recently discussed the problem of young people. After debate, the vote resulted in a majority of professors agreeing to add "Courtship" and "Marriage" to the existing purely academic curriculum. I believe that this bold, innovative, and realistic decision is worthy of attention. (As reported in this newspaper on the 25th.)

Many knowledgeable and intelligent young people have suffered tragedies such as madness, suicide, and running away due to the pain of love and the failure of marriage. Their achievements in scholarship and career have also disappeared with them. This terrible loss is because they lack a true understanding and knowledge of the problems of love and marriage. In fact, we all have to go through the stages of love and marriage. So why don't schools establish these subjects that are so important, so that young people can gain a correct understanding under the guidance and enlightenment of good professors?

In the United States, due to the needs of university students, discussions on issues related to women have long been a formal discipline. Well-known psychologists, doctors, and experts on youth issues are invited to help them solve their problems. Why is it that we Chinese youth, with the same needs, cannot even get a correct answer and guidance on the problems of love and marriage?

"Courtship" and "Marriage" are two essential disciplines. If they are valued by schools and students and their functions are well developed, they will surely reduce many of today's so-called love or family tragedies. This may also be a sign of progress for society.

This is a new and realistic suggestion, and I hope it will receive support from all sides!

### Poetry Records from Sea Red Tower

— Xu Banmeng

Harmonious Sound

Since Zhong Ziqi's departure, Bo Ya has grieved,
A generation's confidant, forever estranged.
Heaven and earth, full of emotion, leave me to grow old,
Rivers and mountains, silent, bid people farewell in haste.
Life's path is as narrow and treacherous as the Silkworm Thicket,
The sea of dust is cast off like a butterfly's dream, so cool.
The twelve immortal towers, with five-colored brushes,
Perhaps in Chengdu, there is a Manqing gone mad.

Hometown

The autumn cold in East River breaks the heart,
Sad clouds like the sea darken the wilderness.
On the eighth month's tide, white horses gallop,
At the end of Three Mountains and Sea, red sheep run.
Submergence cannot save from the pain of approaching the abyss,
The small sky cannot cure the blindness of sitting in a well.
Sadly, the mountain colors of Jingnan are dismal,
Red maples like blood, frost flies in the night.

Spring Sorrow Sent to a Friend

Flowers lock the green moss beside the narrow lane,
Sparse willows along the Wu dike carry roosting crows.
All spring long, I carry a staff, sorrowing for the end of spring,
All day long, I climb the tower, watching the setting sun.
The night moon over a thousand mountains obscures old forts,
Evening clouds in two places hear mournful horns.
Only the traveler's robe remains, with a thousand lines of tears,
Where is the home that spreads throughout China?

High Heaven, Great Earth, past, present, and future,
Ancient traces, distant, sink for ages.
Wealth and status are irrelevant to matters of life and death,
Right and wrong do not stir the ashes of the heart.
Carefree seagulls and herons are all my friends,
Pleasing moss and lichen make up appreciative sounds.
Let's keep the good times we have before our eyes,
There's no need to entrust lingering sounds to a jade zither.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Striving to Remedy (112)

When Zhu Zhai heard this, he couldn't help but shudder. He never thought she would resent him to this extent. He couldn't say the words he had prepared. He responded with a "Alright!" lowered his head dejectedly, and walked out of the house. Feng Sheng saw him out of the door and slammed it shut. Zhu Zhai turned around and looked at the door, unable to help but feel sad. At this moment, he was like a homeless dog, chased out by its master with a whip. He walked out of the alley alone and hailed a three-wheeled military vehicle, blankly returning to his dormitory. He lay on the bed, thinking about everything that had happened. He felt that Yunxiang and Feng Sheng acted completely differently. Each had her own style. Judging by their circumstances, neither could forgive him. What should he do about this? He had originally thought that Feng Sheng was a straightforward and cheerful person. If he begged her a few times in front of her, she would definitely agree. He didn't expect her to hate him so deeply, even saying that he was already dead and that she had no attachment to him at all. Judging from tonight's situation, it was impossible to reconcile with her. From what she showed him tonight, it could be said that she was completely disappointed. Only Yunxiang, although she resented him, kept it in her heart. In her words, there was still lingering affection. He would still go to her house tomorrow and express himself frankly. If he could get her understanding, their initial hope could still be achieved. He had previously thought there were all kinds of difficulties, but now, given Feng Sheng's expression, it would be easier to resolve. Zhu Zhai spent the night thinking wildly and didn't sleep well. The next day, he was too lazy to go to work. It was only after nine o'clock that he rushed to Yunqing's house. According to Li Ma, who served Yunqing, "Miss is sick and hasn't gotten out of bed." Zhu Zhai went straight to Yunqing's bedroom upstairs. Only Yunqing was lying in bed, her face sallow and her spirit very haggard. Zhu Zhai didn't wait to be greeted and sat down on the edge of her bed, asking, "What's wrong? Have you taken any medicine?" Yunxiang didn't say a word, tears welling up in her eyes. She turned her body around, facing the inside of the bed. Zhu Zhai gently patted her quilt with his hand and said, "What is it? What's bothering you?" Yunxiang replied with a sob, "I told you not to come. Why did you come again? I don't want to see you!" Zhu Zhai said, "I have nowhere else to go but you. I didn't sleep all night last night. I thought about it all night. I can only come here to talk to you." Yunqing said, "I told you to go home. Why don't you go back?" Zhu Zhai said, "I already went back last night. Feng Sheng chased me out. She said I was already dead and didn't want to talk to me anymore. How could I go back?" When Yunxiang heard this, she was very surprised. She turned her face towards Zhu Zhai and asked, "How did she chase you out? What did you say to her when you went back?" Zhu Zhai recounted in detail what happened from the moment he entered the door until he was chased out. Yunxiang said, "This is your recklessness. No wonder Feng Sheng!"

### Lu You's Diary

— Chen Zuogao

After the Southern Song Dynasty, Lu You and Fan Chengda were known for their diaries. He Yu (Zi Duren) of Anlu in the Ming Dynasty said in his "Yi Bu Tan Zi," volume one: "Lu Wu-guan and Fan Shi-hu of the Song Dynasty were both masters of diary writing. One has 'Ru Shu Ji' (Entering Shu Diary), and one has 'Wu Chuan Ji' (Wu Boat Diary). They record the scenery of the Three Gorges, not different from painted pictures, and are vivid when read." It is noted that You (1125-1210), styled Wu-guan and nicknamed Fang-weng, loved the customs of Sichuan all his life, so he wrote "Jian Nan Shi Gao" (Sword South Poetry Drafts) and "Ru Shu Ji" (Entering Shu Diary). The History of the Song Dynasty says, "When Chengda was in charge of Shu, he made him a consulting official; people criticized him for being slightly uninhibited, hence the nickname Fang-weng." (Song Shi, volume 395, biography 154, biography of Lu You) This book in six volumes, is probably from the Qian Dao period; it is a record of You's journey from Shanyin, Zhejiang to Bianzhou as a deputy prefect. Fang-weng himself said, "On the sixth day of the twelfth month of the fifth year of the Qian Dao era, I received a report... I was sick for a long time, and rice was not suitable for labor." So he set off late on the eighteenth day of the intercalary fifth month of the following year, and the record began at that time and ended early on the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month of the same year when he arrived at Yaozhou. During this journey, he left the Grand Canal, crossed the Yangtze River, and entered the Three Gorges. The mountains and rivers, the favorable and unfavorable winds and waters, a single boat leisurely, living on the boat for nearly half a year. The thorny terrain and difficult roads of Shu can be imagined. Furthermore, he used a clear and elegant writing style to correct ancient sites. How could it be compared to "indulging in scenery and recording trivial details?" Zhang Peilun of the Qing Dynasty also commented on it in his "Jian Yu Diary," which will not be repeated here.

### Semi-Insider News

— Diao Ying

The world seems to have a fondness for exploring people's privacy, so whether it is newspapers or magazines, both domestic and foreign, as long as they publish more insider news or political secrets, they can always be welcomed by readers. Some newspapers in Shanghai competed to publish insider news some time ago, but in reality, most of these insiders were already public secrets, and some didn't even qualify for the word "secret." It was just that the reporter had sorted out the news that had already been published in fragments, making it easier for readers to understand the ins and outs and giving them a fresh impression.

However, a new writing style is currently popular in the American news world. They use empathetic writing and concise, tight text to report rumors, speculations, and fantasies as much as possible—sometimes there is also some real insider news. These kinds of things are mostly churned out daily in large quantities by some "columnists" and "radio commentators" who are all the rage. Because the reliability of their "news" is quite questionable and the "insider information" is not necessarily true to its name, I will tentatively call it "semi-insider news."

Even so, the readership of "semi-insider news" is broad and the influence is far-reaching. Because they are quite interesting and can satisfy people's desire to snoop into privacy. Recently, "Washington Newsletter," a column in Collier's magazine, was restored. The things published can be said to be standard "semi-insider news." The value of the news itself may be questionable, but this form of expression is still worthy of our attention. If it is used as a clue to interview news, it is even first-class material. Now, I will select and translate a few excerpts below.

(1) On the eve of the American election, Senate Speaker Vandenberg has reached a tacit understanding and close cooperation with presidential candidate New York Governor Dewey. The basis of their cooperation is twofold: first, they both strongly oppose candidate Republican Senator Taft; and second, they both highly approve of the Republican foreign policy adviser Dulles (Dulles has an even closer relationship with Dewey). According to people familiar with the inside situation, when the Republican convention is held in Philadelphia, Vandenberg will fully support Dewey so that Dewey can get the Republican nomination for presidential candidate. If he still fails, Vandenberg will join the race, and Dewey will give him full support.

(2) Truman's national universal military training bill is unlikely to pass. Although Truman has repeatedly emphasized the importance of universal military training, most congressmen ignore it.

(3) Although the results of the French election are still undecided, de Gaulle has been actively campaigning in the United States. There are many confidants of de Gaulle in the French Embassy in Washington. They not only do clever propaganda for de Gaulle, but also immediately report any news from the United States to de Gaulle. The Schumann government is aware of this situation but cannot stop it. (Translator's note: Prime Minister Schumann recently publicly criticized de Gaulle's policies as not in line with French national conditions.)

(4) The call for US Ambassador to the UK Douglas to be appointed as the director of the Marshall Plan is very high. Many people are now vying for the position of Ambassador to the UK, especially the current Ambassador to Australia Butler (formerly a big banker) and Ambassador to Poland Griffiths (a giant on Wall Street).

(5) Argentine dictator Peron once declared that he was willing to lend 5 billion US dollars to South American countries, which is all nonsense. In fact, Argentina's gold reserves and dollar reserves are extremely alarming. The UK once sold the railway built in Argentina to Peron, but it was extremely difficult to collect the debt from him. Peron only has some surplus grains left, and he wants to wait for a good price to sell them.
