### China, the United States, and Britain to Take United Action: Simultaneously Recognize the Republic of Korea; Jointly Strive for Prosperity and Stability in the Orient

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] It is reported that China, the United States, and Britain will adopt a unified approach to simultaneously recognize the newly established Republic of Korea, which was founded on a constitutional basis. Since the general election held in Korea under the supervision of the United Nations, the three countries have been exchanging opinions. Now, the Korean National Assembly has agreed to President Syngman Rhee's nomination of General Lee Bum Suk as the first Prime Minister. The first cabinet will also be formed in the near future. Formal recognition by the three countries is not far off. After being recognized by the major Allied powers, Korea will be able to receive political power from the US military and regain its independent autonomy, which it lost more than 50 years ago. Following the December 1945 Moscow Conference, the Three Foreign Ministers Conference decided on a five-year trusteeship for Korea by the four powers. However, the Korean people and revolutionary leaders expressed their opposition. Despite the passage of years, no further agreement was reached between the countries, and the situation in Korea deteriorated under the occupation by the US and Soviet armies. Last April, Foreign Minister Wang of our country sent a letter to Marshall, advocating that Korea should gain independence as soon as possible and suggesting that if the occupying countries could not reach an agreement, China, the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union should conduct rapid and comprehensive consultations. Subsequently, the Korean issue was brought before the United Nations. After many twists and turns, the United Nations Commission, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union, assisted in the establishment of a democratic Korea, resulting in the situation today. Korea is a brotherly country to ours. Throughout its struggle for independence, our country has always provided support. Now that it has finally succeeded, it is not only the realization of the will of the Korean people but also the fulfillment of a long-cherished wish of our entire nation. People from all walks of life in the capital believe that China and Korea will live in permanent peace, jointly solve their own problems, and work together for the prosperity and stability of the Orient.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] Upon hearing that Lee Bum Suk had been appointed as the first Prime Minister of Korea by President Syngman Rhee, Minister of Education Chu Chia-hua sent a telegram of congratulations on the 3rd. The message read: "Delighted to learn of your esteemed appointment as the first Prime Minister after your nation's restoration. All admire your brilliance. It is gratifying beyond measure. Not only can the unification of your country be expected soon, but the friendship between China and Korea will also be further strengthened, making more contributions to promoting peace in East Asia and the world. I send this telegram to express my congratulations. I hope you will take note of it."

### Kuomintang Officials' Symposium: Broadly Reviewing Party Affairs; Reform and the Retention or Abolition of Factions as the Focus of Discussion; The President to Attend Today and Give Instructions

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] The Kuomintang Party Affairs Symposium was held at the National Assembly Hall on the morning of the 3rd at 9:00 AM. More than 400 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, heads of various departments of the Central Party Headquarters, and Kuomintang members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting. The main purpose of convening the meeting was to review current party affairs. Therefore, the entire day's meeting was devoted to attendees expressing their opinions extensively. It lasted from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM in the afternoon. More than 30 people spoke. The meeting is scheduled to continue on the 4th. After the attendees have finished speaking, the Secretary-General will summarize the opinions or elect a representative to be responsible for the summary. The summary will then be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion and research as the basis for reforming party affairs. Speakers were very enthusiastic at today's meeting, and they put forward many heated opinions. According to sources, the focus of today's speeches included the following points: (1) Party affairs must be reformed; this is a definite and unshakeable principle. As for the system of reform, some people believe that it can be improved according to the current situation, while others advocate for a complete reform. (2) Regarding factions, some people advocate that they should be abolished, some advocate that factions should still be retained, some advocate that the Central Party Headquarters should exercise unified command, and some advocate that the democratic centralism system should still be adopted, with the final decision-making power granted to the President. (3) The party should be reformed simultaneously with the economy and military. (4) The party's reform should be adapted to the constitution and should make good use of the constitution. (5) The party must seek the welfare of the majority of people, etc. The reasons they gave for the reform were that the current party affairs were not progressive and were corrupt and backward. If they did not catch up quickly, the future course of events would be unimaginable. Regarding the faction issue, some advocated that they should still be allowed to exist and that they should be allowed to form their own organizations separately. Others advocated that factions must withdraw from the Party Headquarters. Someone said that the unsound personnel system within the party was the phenomenon that formed factions. The two points above were the most important focus of today's review meeting. Some also touched on issues such as the personnel system. However, the issues that were discussed the longest were still: (1) Reform is a necessary task, and (2) The faction's survival question. The meeting will continue for another day on the 4th. More than 40 people, including Sun Yulin, Yu Peihou, and Cheng Tianfang, spoke today. Wu Zhongxin presided over this afternoon's meeting.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] It has been decided that the President will attend the Kuomintang Party Affairs Symposium on the afternoon of the 4th to give instructions.

The Kuomintang Party Affairs Symposium opened in Nanjing yesterday. It is heard that there will be two days of meetings to discuss the plan for improving party affairs. In addition to the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members remaining in Nanjing and the Kuomintang's elected Legislative and Supervisory Committee members, the heads of various ministries and commissions who are members of the Kuomintang will also participate in the discussions. It can truly be called a grand gathering of the Kuomintang. Although this is only a symposium, it may not have a decisive effect. However, if there are any resolutions, they may serve as the basis for future discussions at the Central Plenary Session. At this critical moment when the nation's survival and the revolution's success or failure are at stake, the Kuomintang's self-examination of party affairs to seek improvement is a welcome phenomenon, both for the Kuomintang itself and for the influence on our nation and people. However, the most important thing is that we must know that it is not about discussion but about implementation, not about merely arguing with words and criticizing each other, but about each aspect and each committee member thoroughly reflecting on themselves and using actions to first reform themselves, in order to gain the trust of the people.

The Chinese Kuomintang is originally incomparable to ordinary political parties. In terms of history, it is a political party with more than fifty years of revolutionary history, and it has actually held political power for twenty years. In the first half of the revolution, it led the Chinese people in revolution, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and founded the Republic of China; it defeated the warlords and unified the country. During the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang led the military and civilians of the country in a difficult war of resistance, defeated the violent Japanese, abolished all unequal treaties, and jumped to become one of the five strongest countries in the post-war world. In all fairness, the Kuomintang has made unparalleled contributions to the country. With such a history, it should be indelible in the hearts of the people forever, and the people will always remember it. In terms of doctrine and political program, the Kuomintang believes in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and implements the Three Principles of the People, which are not only needed by China at present, but also needed by China in the future. All patriotic and upright citizens, even if they have not joined the Kuomintang, mostly believe in the Three Principles of the People, believing that they are most suitable for the national conditions. They still hold hope for the Kuomintang and yearn for the emergence of a new China under the Three Principles of the People. But why does there seem to be a wave of criticism of the Kuomintang spreading in society today, as if the Kuomintang has committed some major crime against the nation and people? Indeed, when a political party has been in power for too long, the people inevitably become tired of it, just like the situation of the Conservative Party in Britain after the war. However, if the Kuomintang itself is still a vigorous, energetic, loyal to its doctrine, unyielding, and confident political party, then with millions of party members who are united in their hearts and minds, relying on decades of revolutionary struggle experience, it should be able to cope with this difficult and great era and never be at a loss, like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

To be honest, the Chinese people seem to have reduced their hopes for the Kuomintang now, and the Kuomintang's glorious history seems dim at present. The Kuomintang members naturally feel infinite pain and regret, and the Chinese people also feel that it is a loss to the country? However, for a glorious revolutionary political party to be reduced to such a state, the Kuomintang must deeply reflect on itself and take responsibility. Now that the Kuomintang is holding a Party Affairs Symposium, if it still cannot examine the root cause of the Kuomintang's illness, prescribe the right medicine, and enable the Kuomintang to be reborn, then today's Kuomintang members will not be able to shoulder the country's burden, and they will also be ashamed of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven!

Where is the root cause of the Kuomintang's ills? It is that it is old and complacent! The only way to cure the disease of being old and complacent is "newness." "Zhou, the old state, its mandate is new"; "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day, and again from day to day," these are all maxims that teach us to strive for newness. So how will the Kuomintang reform? This is indeed not a simple question, and opinions differ. At yesterday's meeting, it was heard that some people advocated forming a separate "Independent Communist Party," which would be surprisingly "new"! If the Kuomintang were to reform in this way, it would seem as if it were competing with the Chinese Communist Party for the orthodoxy of communism, which would be a great joke. According to reports, the party's top leaders have also held meetings repeatedly to discuss reform plans. The questions raised include: (1) simplification or reorganization of party organs; (2) unification or dualization of party affairs organizations; and (3) bottom-up or top-down party system. In fact, from our point of view, if the reform of party affairs is still examined in this way, the result may be equal to zero! These are merely tricks in form and cannot save the Kuomintang from its chronic illness. Standing in the position of protecting the Kuomintang, we would also like to offer two opinions. Whether they are unpleasant to hear is something we cannot worry about.

First, the Kuomintang is an organic body and must understand the role of "metabolism" to maintain the spirit of "daily renewal." Because the Kuomintang has fifty years of revolutionary history and has been in power for more than twenty years, it is now not only a huge organization with numerous members, seemingly becoming a "party of all the people," but also, in these twenty years, countless corrupt and evil elements have infiltrated it one after another. Everything is done in the name of the "party," but in fact, the "party" has never been able to restrain them. In addition, the lack of the organic function of "metabolism" has made it like a pool of stagnant water, harboring dirt and filth, so that fragrant and foul odors are mixed together. For ten years, there has been a stench, and people only see a part of the corrupt and deteriorating party members, forgetting the countless martyrs who shed blood and sacrificed themselves and the many struggling people who endured hardships and acted independently. At the same time, a successful party often maintains its current state, only knowing how to continue the status quo and being unable to come up with a new style of work. It is even more unable to make the decision of a strong man cutting off his wrist, so it allows the atmosphere of corruption and decline to gradually spread without making any efforts to save it. In addition, within the party, factions are divided, and outside the party, people are instigated to create discord. Cunning people use their intelligence and talent to 横行于其中. If the reform of party affairs in the future cannot deeply "blame oneself" and thoroughly clarify the situation, then the corrupt dregs will still remain, and the worthy people in the party will still be buried. There will be no way for metabolism to take place, and how can vitality be restored? Examining it for a year and a half will inevitably be of no use!

Second, since the Kuomintang is a revolutionary political party, all Kuomintang members should come for revolutionary aspirations, and the first meaning of a revolutionary is self-sacrifice! Those who do not have this revolutionary spirit of self-sacrifice should not be tolerated by the Kuomintang in the future. It must be understood that the revolutionary spirit is not the spirit shown by some people who are merely "self-proclaimed advanced and criticize at will," but the self-sacrificing spirit of burying oneself in hard work and not seeking fame. The spirit of the revolutionary predecessors during the Xinhai Revolution and the Huanghuagang Uprising is the best medicine for the Kuomintang to treat its root causes in the future. In the past, a glorious history of the Kuomintang was written with the blood of revolutionary martyrs! Now that the Kuomintang is facing unprecedented difficulties, Kuomintang members should have the ambition to sacrifice themselves for the party and the country with a great spirit, and should not only scold people loudly within the party, never blaming themselves, secretly vying for power, and never giving in. Otherwise, the wish to save the party may not be fulfilled, and the party and the country may perish together! The Kuomintang's big problem today is not that there are too many party members, but that there are too few party members with a revolutionary spirit. It is not that party members do not talk about revolution, but that party members only talk about revolution and forget that each person must first revolutionize their own heart! We believe that all selfish and self-interested people, regardless of whether they want to use the Kuomintang as a stepping stone to advancement or use the Kuomintang to seek fame and reputation, the Kuomintang should resolutely and decisively no longer allow them to stay in the party and become a fermenting agent for the continued corruption of the Kuomintang! Only in this way can the Kuomintang extricate itself, and only then can the Kuomintang authorities truly start anew with the people.

### Capital Police Chief Reports on Public Security: Clearing Bandit Underground Organizations; Striving to Eliminate the Impact of Rising Prices on Society

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Huang Zhenwu, Chief of the Capital Police Department, hosted a meeting with journalists in Nanjing on the evening of the 3rd to report on the recent state of public security in the capital. He first stated that since taking office last December, he had strengthened winter defense arrangements, and fortunately, no accidents had occurred. Later, as the National Assembly and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan successively convened, the communists publicly declared that they would obstruct the implementation of the constitution and conspired to incite student movements and labor unrest, creating bloodshed in an attempt to confuse domestic and foreign audiences. Fortunately, the citizens of the capital understood the righteousness and were not deceived. Police officers maintained close vigilance day and night, and ultimately, they passed peacefully. Huang also pointed out that the current rising prices and the increasing difficulty of making a living have a profound impact on social security. The Police Department has a responsibility to strive to eliminate the situation. To this end, he described in detail the recent cracking of a shocking theft case, the arrest of Wang Shoujin, a "Macau" expert who had been active in the northern district for two months, specializing in stealing from the residences of diplomatic missions and senior government officials. According to the police officer in charge of the case, the case cost as much as 2 billion, but the recovered stolen goods are estimated to be worth hundreds of billions. Subsequently, Huang emphasized that thieves only affect public security, causing residents to suffer financial losses. However, the lurking, espionage, sabotage, and insidious tricks of the communists are even more terrifying. He announced news that is still unknown to the public, saying that around the time of the National Assembly, the police had discovered a fire-setting team sent by the communists to Nanjing, and also cracked the location where they transported bullets. The case of the secret bandit organization hidden in Sanwenhe in the western suburbs of Nanjing, which was cracked in early July, has conclusive evidence and is currently being tried by the Special Criminal Court. He believes that other underground organizations of bandits that [missing character] been cracked will be cleared one after another, and hopes to obtain assistance from all parties in the overall battle against the full-scale rebellion of the communists, so that the bandits cannot hide and their conspiracies and insidious plans cannot be carried out.

### Three Envoys Meet Stalin
### Each Reports to Their National Government
### Content of Talks Temporarily Undisclosed

[United Press Moscow dispatch] Signs of a swift resolution to the German problem emerged. After a two-hour meeting with Premier Stalin at the Kremlin at 9 PM on the 2nd, the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France left with smiles. Moscow observers believe that discussions with Stalin or Molotov will continue. Molotov also attended the historical meeting on the 2nd. After the meeting, the three envoys went to the US Embassy, joined by British Chargé d'Affaires Harrison and US Chargé d'Affaires Kohler, to jointly review the results of the meeting. The representatives of the three countries then reported the details of the meeting to their respective governments, refusing to disclose the contents to the press. The next meeting will depend on their government's reaction to this meeting and their instructions.

[Agence France-Presse London dispatch] The British Foreign Office confirmed this morning that it had received a report from the British representative, Roberts, stating that he had met with Stalin last night. According to sources at the British Foreign Office, the three representatives were received by Stalin separately, with US Ambassador Smith first, followed by British special envoy Roberts, and finally French Ambassador Chataigneau. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office declined to comment, stating only that the Foreign Office was reviewing the report received from Moscow.

[United Press Washington dispatch] The State Department received a report on the 3rd from US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith regarding the meeting between the Western envoys and Stalin. State Department News Officer McDermott stated, "We have received Ambassador Smith's report." When asked for details, McDermott replied, "That's all we can say, we have no content to share." The report was immediately studied by Secretary of State Marshall, Under Secretary of State Lovett, and other officials. There is still no indication when the details will be released.

[Central News Agency Berlin dispatch] According to well-informed Soviet sources, if Western countries resolutely implement the plan to establish a West German government, the Soviet authorities will not back down. Regarding the two-hour meeting between Stalin and the Western envoys to the Soviet Union, the Soviet sources stated that the only possible topic for discussion under the current circumstances may be the issue of the peaceful withdrawal of Western troops from Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse London dispatch] The authorities remained silent on the meeting between the special envoys of the three Western powers and Stalin in Moscow. However, British politicians expect that if today's meeting yields results, it could pave the way for a reconvening of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, and even in the next stage, it is possible that US President Truman, British Prime Minister Attlee, and French Premier Marie will meet with Stalin in person to negotiate. The agenda of this meeting will extend beyond the scope of the Berlin issue and may address the various issues on which the Soviet Union and the three Western powers have disagreed for months. Apart from semi-official speculations, the specific instructions given by the governments of Britain, the United States, and France to their envoys in Moscow have not been disclosed to date. The three governments are deeply concerned about harming the outcome of the negotiations, hence their tight-lipped approach.

### Berlin Police Force Splintered
### Soviet-Zone Police Chief Illegally Arrests People

[United Press Berlin dispatch] The East-West dispute has erupted again in Berlin, and the Berlin police force has split. Western-Zone Police Chief Stumm accused Soviet-Zone Police Chief Markgraf on the 3rd of arresting four non-Communist police officers, including one female officer. Stumm, who was recently appointed by the city government, telephoned Markgraf, who had been trained in Moscow, demanding the immediate release of the four. After being dismissed by the city government, Markgraf refused to hand over his post, leading to the split in the Berlin police force. Stumm's headquarters has been moved to the American sector. When the four police officers were dispatched to the old headquarters to retrieve files, Markgraf ordered their arrest. Markgraf, for his part, claims to be the only legitimate police authority in Berlin and has published large advertisements in Soviet-affiliated newspapers outlining the procedures for Germans traveling between West Germany and Berlin.

### Soviet Control of Berlin

[Central News Agency Berlin dispatch] The German People's Congress, an executive body controlled by the Communist Party and supported by the Soviet Union, convened a meeting today to draft a constitution for the Soviet zone.

### Fighting for Navigation Rights on the Danube River
### Britain Expresses No Fear of Threats
### Ambassador Baker Responds to Soviet Accusations

[This report] London Broadcasting Belgrade dispatch on the 3rd: British Ambassador Baker, who attended the Danube River Conference, responded to Vyshinsky's remarks last Saturday, saying, "During the conference, I will never succumb to any coercion or intimidation. The British delegation will not be provoked by Vyshinsky's attacks. In other words, the so-called ultimatum-like final demand does not exist in my mind. Regarding Vyshinsky's accusation that Western countries are imperialists, Baker replied, "If the majority of countries control inland river shipping and transport materials from other countries, is this not imperialism?"

[Agence France-Presse Belgrade dispatch on the 2nd] The new draft Danube River Convention proposed by the Soviet Union strongly emphasizes the "principle of free navigation on the Danube River, without prejudice to the interests and sovereignty of the Danube River countries." It also suggests that the new Danube River Committee's headquarters should be located in Romania's Galati. An administrative body composed of both the Soviet Union and Romania should be established in the "Iron Gate" area. The 1921 Danube River Convention should be abolished.

[US Information Service Washington dispatch on the 2nd] The State Department issued a statement to the press today, stating that the "insistence" of the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries at the Danube River Conference on excluding English from being used as an "official" language is detrimental to the progress of the conference. The statement said, "The eyes of the world are focused on this conference, and this apparent predetermination to pass this resolution will create an unfortunate impression." It is rumored that Vyshinsky presented a document on Saturday that was practically equivalent to an ultimatum, demanding that participating countries accept the Eastern European countries' plan for the Danube River. When asked what stance the United States would take on this matter, a State Department spokesman replied that the US stance would be explained by the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia and head of the US delegation to the Danube River Conference, Kennan.

### Hundreds of American Communist Spies
### Still Working for the Soviet Union
### Accusation by Former US Communist Leader Burton

[United Press Washington dispatch on the 2nd] Former US Communist leader Burton accused on the 2nd that "there are currently hundreds of Communist Party members serving in the federal government as spies for the Soviet Union" and are still working. Burton, who was the leader of the US Communist Party for ten years, left the party in 1945. He also said that the film industry is a major base for supporting Communist activities.

At the same time, Monte Hall, the acting chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, announced that Seiffert Masters, a former official of the Department of Commerce, had been ordered to appear before the committee to answer the accusation that he led a Soviet spy organization during the war. Hall added that Miss Bentley, who had once been a Communist agent, had listed Seiffert and more than 30 other federal employees as members of the spy organization last week. They will be allowed to appear to defend themselves if they wish. Hall continued that the committee believes it now has enough evidence to initiate criminal proceedings immediately. He also said that the committee may ask Attorney General Clark to initiate a grand jury investigation into espionage and Communist activities within the government. Bentley's testimony has been extensively supported by Burton. Burton testified that the American Communist Party is full of organizations conducting military and diplomatic espionage for the Soviet Union. Burton also said that he knew the names of US government officials who supplied intelligence to the Soviet Union, as he had been a member of the Communist Political Committee and had worked with several spy organizations.

### Communist Elements in the US State Department Have Been Eliminated

Congressman Johnkman tells Congress

[Central News Agency Washington dispatch on the 2nd] At a time when the government agencies here are shrouded in suspicion due to the Soviet "spy network" case, the report released today by Republican Congressman Johnkman is tantamount to issuing a clean bill of health to the State Department.

He told Congress that Assistant Secretary of State Peurifoy has expelled disruptive Communist elements and sympathizers from the State Department.

### New Hungarian President Takes Office

### Japanese Cabinet on the Verge of Collapse: Ashida Under Fire for Anti-Strike Bill; Dissolution of Parliament Unavoidable in September/October

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The Ashida cabinet, under attack for its ordinance banning strikes by civil servants, is teetering on the brink of collapse today. Japanese observers suggest that unless the Allied Headquarters provides immediate support, the cabinet will fall.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] Significant political changes are inevitable in Japan within the next three months. The dissolution of the current parliament seems unavoidable during the special session scheduled for September/October. According to Japanese observers, Prime Minister Ashida is gradually shifting from his original stance on the matter due to the insistence of Tetsu Katayama, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, on dissolving the parliament. They also point out that the Democratic Party's reshuffling of personnel on the 2nd was an effort to strengthen the party in preparation for the general election after the parliament's dissolution.

Another fact that strongly suggests the parliament will inevitably be dissolved is the emergence of cracks within the Social Democratic Party, which has been the strongest supporter of the Ashida cabinet. Although Labor Minister Kanjū Katō and Interior Minister Masaru Yosomizo, both left-wing figures in the Socialist Party, are willing to remain in the current cabinet until a concrete decision is made on the revision of the Civil Service Law, which is causing much public debate, other left-wing members of the party have harshly criticized the Ashida cabinet, accusing it of "misinterpreting" the Allied Headquarters' letter. Furthermore, the fact that party chairman Tetsu Katayama insisted on dissolving the parliament, disregarding the advice of most right-wing members, suggests that his own position has slightly shifted to the left. Additionally, left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party have issued a statement criticizing the government, stating that the prohibition of collective bargaining and strikes by civil servants violates the sixteen principles of the Far Eastern Commission and accusing the government of deliberately exaggerating MacArthur's letter to avoid its own responsibility. If the current parliament is indeed dissolved, the next general election will inevitably produce a more conservative cabinet.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] After the Japanese government passed the outline of the National Public Service Law amendment at today's cabinet meeting, there will be a considerable period of recess. All cabinet members (including Prime Minister Ashida) will travel to various locations to give political speeches. It is reported that a temporary cabinet meeting is scheduled to be convened again on the 18th of this month to discuss the draft amendment to the Public Service Law.

### Roster of Korean Cabinet Members: Democratic Party Holds Majority; Four Ministers of Finance, Transportation, etc. Announced

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 3rd] As the Presidential Office in South Korea released the names of four of the eleven cabinet members today, political figures predicted that the cabinet, currently being formed under the nomination of the Premier, will be dominated by the Korean Democratic Party. Of the four ministers currently appointed, three belong to the Korean Democratic Party. The full list of cabinet members is expected to be announced before midnight. The names of the four ministers that have been released are Kim Do-yeon as Minister of Finance, Min Hee-shik as Minister of Transportation, and Lee In as Minister of Justice (all of whom are members of the Korean Democratic Party), and Cho Bong-am as Minister of Agriculture (who is non-partisan).

[United Press, Seoul, 3rd] Ms. Eun Roy-i, the official spokeswoman for the Korean Nationalist Party, arrived here by plane on the 3rd to meet with President Syngman Rhee. It is generally speculated that she may assume a position in the South Korean government or be appointed as a Korean representative to the United Nations General Assembly in Paris.

### National Bank Only Willing to Lend Limited Funds for Public Utility Oil and Coal Foreign Exchange: Senators Express Dissatisfaction with New Public Utility Prices; Subcommittee to Propose Emergency Motion to Oppose

In order to solve the difficulties of public utilities and reduce their costs, the municipal government previously decided to request a loan from the National Bank for the foreign exchange needed for one month's worth of oil and coal, so that the prices of oil and coal in the cost of public utilities would not fluctuate for one month. The original loan target was 10 trillion, but after the Public Utilities Bureau finalized negotiations with the National Bank the other day, it was only willing to lend 3.5 trillion, and it must be repaid in the short term, which is a far cry from the amount requested. The Central Bank also stated that "this will not be an example in the future."

Since the announcement of the new prices for public utilities in this city, salaried workers have felt overwhelmed, while the companies still think that the prices have not been raised enough, believing that the authorities are overly suppressing them. According to senators Yu Shunjiang, Hao, and others, who were responsible for investigating the accounts of companies as part of the former Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Senate, companies such as Shanghai Power Company and Telephone Company often claim to be suffering losses, but if we analyze them, there are many unreasonable aspects. First, the salary and allowance item in their expenses is particularly large, especially for foreign personnel. Not only are their base salaries quite high, with monthly payments of thousands of US dollars, but they are even calculated at the black market rate. As a result, it is common for senior personnel to receive hundreds of billions of legal tender per month. As the black market gold certificate rises, salaries increase accordingly, and the company's expenses become even larger, but what the citizens use is legal tender. Second, the government sometimes gives preferential treatment for the foreign exchange needed by the companies for materials, such as one-time foreign exchange settlements or loans, but the companies do not seem to take this into consideration in their accounting.

Senators Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhuang Ping, Fei Shusheng and others, due to the excessively high price increases of public utilities, will propose an emergency motion at the Public Utilities Subcommittee meeting to be held by the Senate in the coming days to unanimously oppose it.

### Air Freight Adjustment: Increase of 34% Effective Today

For all other routes, the national currency prices for passengers, cargo, and mail will be increased by 34% across the board, based on the current prices. Both companies are scheduled to implement the new prices starting today. CNAC's "Overlord" aircraft and CAT's "Pullman" aircraft will be charged an additional 20% on top of the new prices for ordinary aircraft. The new prices for various routes departing from Shanghai are listed below: Shanghai to Nanjing: 17 million yuan, Qingdao: 93 million yuan, Jinan: 136 million yuan, Beiping: 184 million yuan.

### Shipping Industry Price Increase: Effective Tomorrow

### Mayor Wu Visited the Suburbs Yesterday Morning: Gave a Speech to Over a Thousand Refugee Children; "Mayor" Makes a Request to the Mayor; Hopes to Increase Funding for Malnutrition

[This Newspaper] At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu, at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal China Children's Education Center in Caohejing, visited the center with Zhang Peter, the head of the Social Affairs Section, and gave a speech to 1,500 refugee children. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film company sent photographer Wang Xiaoting to capture the scene, which will become part of the "Life of Chinese Children" film.

The Mayor, wearing a beige striped gabardine suit and yellow openwork leather shoes, was greeted with applause by thousands of children when he arrived at the center. He was then led by Cai Zhongde, the children's mayor, and the heads of various bureaus to meet Mayor Wu. After the two mayors met, "Mayor" Cai made three requests: (1) The center's daily expenses for each child are only 30,000 legal tender, which is not enough to buy a sesame cake. Therefore, all the children are pale and thin and malnourished. It is hoped that funding can be increased. (2) The children are growing up and need specialized skills to gain a foothold in society. It is hoped that Mayor Wu can enrich the center's vocational education equipment, such as typewriters, sewing machines, and automobiles, to facilitate learning. (3) In the past six months, the center has taken in 600 homeless children. It is requested that teachers and desks and chairs be increased to facilitate teaching. Mayor Wu immediately replied: (1 and 2) Because a lot of money is needed for these two points, the city government's treasury is empty and it cannot provide subsidies. It is currently planned to sell the ship donated by Wang Zhongying, which is estimated to be worth about 100,000 US dollars. After the sale, it will be decided to donate half to the center. Regarding the third point, Mayor Wu immediately approved it and submitted it to the Municipal Education Bureau, approving the addition of six classes and the purchase of 350 sets of desks and chairs. Then, he went to the square and gave a speech to 1,500 children. The children were all wearing white undershirts with horizontal black stripes, white cloth shorts, and white hats. Although they stood upright under the scorching sun, their spirits were high, but it was difficult to hide their malnourished and haggard faces. Mayor Wu greatly appreciated the children's achievements today after being taken in and trained and hoped that the children would live up to the government's good intentions, strive hard, and prepare to serve the country.

After the speech, he was accompanied by Director Tong Zuwang of the center to inspect the children. The mayor often stroked the children's heads or patted their shoulders. Then he visited the various rooms of the summer camp and left at 9:50.

### Fire at Huzhou Guildhall: Four Funeral Homes Destroyed; Bones Suffer

[This Newspaper] The Huzhou Guildhall at No. 828 Zhongyu Road in Zhabei suddenly caught fire at around 9:00 PM last night. For a time, the fire was out of control. Later, the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade of the Zhabei 123 Section Fire Department and the Baoyu Road Fire Department, etc., rushed to the scene with pump trucks to provide assistance. Unfortunately, there was a lack of tap water nearby. It was not until leather belts were connected from Yongxing Road and Huiwen Road, as many as 40, that water was obtained for injection.

### Bird in a Gilded Cage: Disappointed Person in Love; Miserable Shanghai Miss; Xie Jia-hua Saved After Attempting Suicide by Poisoning

[This Newspaper] Xie Jia-hua, the "Shanghai Miss" who made a name for herself in Hong Kong last year with the Repulse Bay incident, had reconciled with her husband, Rong Meihua, after returning to Shanghai thanks to the mediation of relatives and friends. However, in the past six months, Rong has never kept his promise, strictly controlling Xie's actions and refusing to break off his relationship with his mistress surnamed Zhang. Xie, feeling bored and lonely, depressed, and thinking that she had met an unworthy man, developed the idea of ending her life. On the night of the 24th of last month, she suddenly took sleeping pills to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was rescued quickly and was not in danger. She was then hospitalized for a week and was only discharged yesterday.

According to Xie, Rong had two women before marrying her, but both had divorced him, leaving eight children. Since Xie returned to her husband's home, Rong has ordered her to cut off all social interactions and raise the children. Xie deeply resents that she cannot act freely and often said angrily to Rong: "If I had known that you needed a housekeeper, why did you pursue me in the first place!" Rong tried his best to express that it was only because he deeply loved her that he did this. However, Rong often did not return home all night. After Xie learned that he was still living with his mistress surnamed Zhang in his self-built house on Fulu Road, she urged him to complete the divorce formalities as soon as possible. Rong claimed that the mistress's demands for divorce were too harsh and asked Xie: "If you really love me, how can you bear to make me bankrupt because of this matter?" Seeing that nothing could be done, Xie was resentful and had this act.

Suffering from Mental Illness; Taking Medicine to Sleep

Since Xie had a falling out with Rong last year, she has often felt mentally disturbed. Moreover, due to the above reasons, she developed a disease due to depression. Doctors often advised her to take sleeping pills, so Xie had accumulated as many as nine sleeping pills. At 11:00 PM on the night of the 24th, Xie waited for Rong but he did not arrive. Her heart was aching, and she swallowed all the pills in a daze. When Rong heard the news and rushed home, he stamped his feet at Xie and said: "How can you ask me to live?" Recently, after Xie was discharged from the hospital, she believed that Rong still lacked sincerity and that the relationship between the two could no longer be maintained, and she resolutely demanded a divorce.

Concerned About Face; Refuses Divorce

However, Rong firmly refused to divorce because of his status, career, and face. Xie's family, in view of Rong's making light promises, stated that if he wanted to profess his love again, he must provide a valid guarantee and issue a written statement. However, Rong argued: "Marriage can be written in a contract, and divorce can also be written in a contract. How can a contract be written in the middle?" Xie, having taken medicine, looked haggard and weak, and with tears in her eyes, she repeatedly said that she was busy with the "election" the year before last, filming a movie last year, and the heroic spirit was like yesterday. Who would have thought that after finding a home, she would be subjected to all kinds of torment? She said that she already felt bored with the ups and downs of this world.

### Director Zhou Talks About the Situation at the Reformatory

Afterwards, a reporter interviewed Director Zhou about the situation at the reformatory. According to Director Zhou, the reformatory occupies 105 mu (approximately 17.3 acres) and currently houses 2,500 children in need. The 1,500 children who attended the hearing today are the more orderly ones. Among them, there are 220 female children in need. The oldest is 16 years old, and the youngest is 6 years old. Most of them are petty thieves, gamblers, or even drug addicts. Most of the female children were abducted and intended to be sold as prostitutes but were discovered by the police and sent here. Currently, the reformatory consumes more than 12 shi (approximately 1.44 tons) of rice every day. The reformatory's monthly income is only 1.5 billion (currency unit unspecified), while its expenditures reach 4.2 billion (currency unit unspecified). The shortfall is made up by generous donations from various parties. The survival and development of the reformatory in the future will still rely on the support and assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. As for the children's future prospects, vocational education will be strengthened, such as waiter training, to meet the needs of various parties. In terms of management, the principle of encouraging children's self-governance is adopted. The reformatory has a "city government," a "council," a "post office," a "bank," and a "library," all of which are staffed by the children themselves to cultivate their self-governance abilities.

### Forming a Gang to Extort, Kidnapping a Woman for Ransom, Box Cannon Found in Cathay Hotel, Five Criminals Arrested in Succession

[Our Newspaper Report] Zheng Yaoshan, 49, from Qingpu, resides at No. 9 Dingyu Li, Weining Road, in western Shanghai.

The next day, Zheng reported the information to the Songshan Police Sub-Bureau. Chief Chen ordered Chen Kaizhou, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to lead officers Chen Linshu, Tan Yangsheng, Lu Ziyu, Deng Kexiang, and others to rush to the Cathay Hotel. They arrested Guo Maoheng and confiscated a box cannon and 20 bullets. Afterwards, they sent officers to wait in ambush and arrested Xu Qiufeng. They also sent police officers to a village in Jiading to arrest Ge Yong and Shi Zhengguo, bringing them to justice for investigation.

### General Answers to Questions Regarding Applications for Student Aid: What Conditions Must Be Met? How to Apply? How Much Can Be Obtained?

In the past month, the newspaper's Student Aid Fund Committee has received numerous letters and telegrams from impoverished students at all levels of schools throughout the city, as well as inquiries from relatives and friends who have come to the office in person to ask about the autumn student aid. In addition to having responded separately, we are deeply concerned that many people outside the committee may still be unclear about the content of the aid. Therefore, we have compiled all the questions and prepared a general answer as follows:

(1) What conditions must students meet in order to apply for student aid?

[Answer] Applicants must meet the following conditions: (A) be from an impoverished family; (B) have pure character and sound physique; (C) have excellent academic performance, with an average grade in the top one-third, or have special expertise that is worthy of further study; and (D) have not received free education or other types of aid from the school.

(2) What types of schools must be attended in order to apply for student aid?

[Answer] Applications are open to all students attending registered private junior high schools, senior high schools, universities, and vocational schools. Public, municipal, provincial, and national schools are not eligible.

(3) When will application forms be available?

[Answer] They will be issued separately when school starts: early September for junior and senior high schools, and mid-September for universities and vocational schools.

(4) What are the application procedures?

[Answer] (A) Students must first register with the school; (B) those who are deemed qualified by the school principal and head teacher and are willing to be recommended can obtain application forms from the newspaper's Student Aid Fund Committee; (C) students must fill out the application form, attach a 2.5-inch headshot, and return it to the school; (D) the principal must fill out a letter of recommendation and submit it together with the application form to the newspaper's Student Aid Fund Committee for review.

(5) Why was the application not approved last year even though all procedures were followed?

[Answer] After the initial review by the newspaper, the applications are submitted to the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee for a second review. The committee must verify against the list of free tuition recipients, which accounts for 20% of the student body in each school, and ensure that the applicant has not applied for aid elsewhere, has excellent character and academic performance, and has never participated in illegal activities. In other words, if any of the above four conditions are not met, there is no hope of approval.

(6) What is the review process for applying for student aid?

[Answer] The application forms issued by the newspaper are recommended by the principal and reviewed by the newspaper. After passing the review by the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, student aid will be issued.

(7) Can student aid be issued according to the actual amount of tuition?

[Answer] This depends on the amount of donations received and must comply with the standards set by the Scholarship Unified Review Committee. In the past, student aid has generally covered 70% of the tuition. Currently, tuition fees have increased sharply, and there are too many applicants, so maintaining the 70% level may not be easy.

(8) How can we prevent students from fairly well-off families from applying for aid?

[Answer] In each round of applications, there are indeed a small number of students from fairly well-off families who receive aid. The newspaper is determined to prevent this from happening. We hope that students at each school will actively report such situations. If you encounter such situations, please report them to us at any time, and we will investigate thoroughly. We especially hope that the principals of each school will make careful recommendations, without being perfunctory or biased, so that this kind of abuse will not occur.

She said that her father had always been loving to her. At this point, she began to sob uncontrollably. Judge Ou then addressed both parties, instructing the plaintiff to use educational methods to influence the defendant and to pay the defendant a certain amount of living expenses each month. He ordered the plaintiff to withdraw the charges and warned the defendant not to cause any more disturbances at the school after the plaintiff paid the monthly living expenses. His words were earnest and moving. Xu Xia repeatedly clasped her hands and thanked the court profusely. The plaintiff said that withdrawing his charges against his wife required the understanding of the Jiancheng Elementary School's board of directors. The court scheduled a decision for the 7th of this month.

Reader Consultation

### Legal Clarifications: Strange Events in the Scientific Age: Dissolution of Engagement Due to Incompatible Horoscopes

Jiang Yaochang asks: My relative A (male) was engaged to B (female) in 1943 through arrangements made by his parents. Now, it has been discovered that B falsely reported her age, and after re-matching their horoscopes, it is known that they are incompatible. They now intend to dissolve the engagement. Please advise: (1) Can an engagement contract entered into by parents on behalf of a minor be repudiated? (2) If B is not at fault, can the engagement be dissolved based solely on the reason of incompatible horoscopes? (3) Can the betrothal gifts given at the time of the engagement be recovered from B? If B refuses to return them, how should one respond? (4) Can a unilateral announcement be made in the newspaper to dissolve the engagement and engage to Miss C?

[Answer from Mr. Tang Mingshi:] (1) Males under the age of seventeen and females under the age of fifteen may not enter into an engagement contract (see Article 973 of the Civil Code). Minors above these ages who enter into an engagement contract must obtain the consent of their legal representatives (see Article 974 of the same law). An engagement contract should be entered into by the parties themselves (Article 972 of the same law). In other words, an engagement cannot be made if the parties do not agree. An engagement contract entered into by parents on behalf of a minor is not fundamentally invalid; its validity depends entirely on whether the male and female parties agree to it. (2) If the age difference between the male and female is too great, physiologists suggest that marriage may not be suitable; however, affection seems to transcend this limitation. Moreover, if there is only a one-year difference, and the difference is relatively young, it is unclear why party A intends to dissolve the engagement. Although the law advocates for honest contract formation, this case does not seem to constitute significant fraud. The notion of incompatible horoscopes is insufficient as a legal reason for dissolving the engagement. (3) Damages require fault as a prerequisite. If the fault for dissolving the engagement does not lie with party B, or if party A's reason for dissolving the engagement is insufficient, then damages cannot be discussed. Therefore, recovering the betrothal gifts is a form of compensation. (4) If one disregards everything and breaches an existing engagement without meeting the conditions for dissolution, then the offending party shall be liable for damages.

### National Banks Adhere to Two Major Principles: Strictly Review Foreign Exchange Payments; New Plan to be Formulated Separately for Handling Overseas Remittances

[Report from this newspaper] The National Bank Foreign Exchange Review Committee held its second committee meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Li Lixia, Lin Chongtang, Shao Huihua, and others attended. The meeting was presided over by convener Xia Jinxiong. Principles for foreign exchange review were decided upon. According to Director Xia, the establishment of this committee is to coordinate the payment of foreign exchange required by the government, merchants, and students studying abroad. All foreign exchange handling units under the Central Bank are transferred to this committee. The Non-Import Foreign Exchange Review Committee is renamed the Non-Import Foreign Exchange Review Group. The review of foreign exchange for merchant imports is still handled by the Import Management Committee, but the insurance and commission portions are reviewed by this committee. In the future, the review will adhere to two major principles: strictness and transparency. Foreign exchange for non-quota imports will be strictly reviewed. Foreign exchange for travel and sightseeing is especially prohibited. Even international conferences will be considered for approval based on their importance. The foreign exchange review process for merchants and students studying abroad will be completely transparent to dispel doubts and avoid unnecessary troubles. Furthermore, to balance foreign exchange income and expenditure, the government has decided to establish a separate foreign exchange budget in addition to the ordinary budget. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan Foreign Exchange Review Committee formally approved the compilation of the foreign exchange budget.

Another report: To increase overseas remittances and replenish foreign exchange reserves, the government will soon formulate a new plan to be announced and implemented. In the future, in addition to selling foreign exchange certificates at the exchange rate, overseas remittances will also receive a subsidy of 25%. All handling fees and remittance fees will be waived. After this news spread, the selling price of foreign exchange certificates in the city yesterday rose sharply, exceeding 5 million yuan.

### Buyers Hesitant and Unmoving, Chinese Stocks Trending Weak

Yesterday, Chinese stocks received no help from outside sources. Actual goods were sluggish and lacked appeal. Fickle buyers, aware of the difficulties, retreated. As a result, Yongsha experienced a sharp decline to the limit down near noon, the entire process marked by timidity and weakness, creating a very unstable atmosphere.

The market opened steady. Yongchao started at 12,800 yuan. From 11,830 yuan, numbers 65, 83, 160, 23, 11, 102, 218, 216, 13, 106, 155, 224, 71, 163, 145, 115, 95, and 111 actively sold off, causing a decline to 11,900 yuan. Numbers 54, 180, 218, 206, 185, 145, 11, and 71 slightly compensated, pushing the price up to 12,300 yuan. However, Guangdong merchants continued their selling pressure. Actual goods of yarn and cloth appeared weak, triggering another wave of panic. Numbers 224, 222, 89, 111, 213, 226, 155, 85, 4, 207, 206, 120, 55, 65, and 2 sold off, ultimately leading to a retreat to 11,430 yuan, the limit down. Near noon, numbers 99, 80, 67, 228, 187, and 154 absorbed the selling. Numbers 119, 51, 151, 55, and 4 then emerged, trending the market. Numbers 154, 47, 180, and 13 maintained the price, with the noon close at 11,550 yuan. Besides Yongye hitting the limit up, Meilin and Hengfeng experienced small declines, Xinyi remained flat, and Meiya, Xinhe, Xinguang, Tongyi, Nei Yi, Jinglun, Yonggong, Huafeng, and Xinhua each fell by 10%. The rest declined by 0.5%.

In the afternoon, Yongsha started at 11,900 yuan. Numbers 145 and 95 immediately sold down to 11,680 yuan. Numbers 131, 76, 69, 224, 168, 205, and 89 stepped in, pushing the price up to 12,070 yuan. With Rongfeng hitting the limit down, market sentiment remained extremely fragile. Numbers 135, 169, 164, 4, 145, 11, and 216 sold down to 11,730 yuan. Numbers 143, 218, 99, 145, 155, and 12 maintained the price. Numbers 224, 72, 180, 97, 76, 65, 156, and 95 then emerged, causing indecisive trading. National banks continued to sell. Numbers 207, 219, and 89 stepped in, with the market closing at 11,800 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Rongfeng hit the limit down, Liandi hit the limit up, Xinyi and Tongyi, and Zhabei remained flat, Jinglun rose by 0.5%, Xinhe, Quanyu, and Huochai experienced small declines, and the rest rose slightly. Over-the-counter shares of unlisted companies failed to rally, especially Huashang and Dasheng, which retreated by 0.5% due to weakness.

Government Bonds

Yesterday, they also softened. Room 552 initially sold and then bought. Dacheng also bought, while Rooms 500, 360, and 503 sold. Unified C opened at 1.22 million, rose from 1.23 million, and retreated to 1.11 million at the close. Compared to the previous close, categories A, B, C, and D each fell by 50,000 yuan, and category E fell by 60,000 yuan. The trading volume was 2 million.

### Money and Banking Industry Changes Interbank Interest Rate

Regarding deposit and loan rates and interbank overnight lending, it has been decided at a joint meeting of the Banking, Money, and Trust Associations to revise the rates starting today (the 4th): deposit overnight lending at 2.1 yuan per thousand, interbank overnight lending at 11 yuan per thousand, and loan overnight lending at 13 yuan per thousand.

### The Money Market Trend Remains Stable, Banks and Bureaus Continue to Have Clearing Deficits

Yesterday, the trend in the Shanghai money market remained relatively stable. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury continued to have clearing deficits during bill exchange, totaling 107.9 billion.

However, the Central Bank is closely monitoring market conditions and will tighten the money supply if there are fluctuations.

### Tea Merchants Yesterday Visited President Yu to Request an Increase in Tea Loan Amounts

[This Newspaper Report] The tea quota for this year has been approved by the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks, and the quota has been increased. Recently, due to soaring prices and increased costs, the industry has requested another increase in tea loans. President Yu of the Central Bank met with Tang Jigan, Chairman of the Tea Trade Association, and Song Qifan, Chairman of the Tea Association, yesterday to inquire about the industry's situation. Mr. Shu Yu Guoqian gave a detailed report on the difficulties faced by the tea industry. Mr. Yu agreed to find a way to remedy the situation, and after the matter is reviewed by the Discount and Loan Committee, it will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks for a decision. There is hope for another increase in tea loans.

### Export Tea Market Is Quiet

The export of Teas to Bombay, India, which used to be a major trade, was stagnant for a long time, but yesterday suddenly showed signs of recovery. Although India has been striving for self-sufficiency in tea production, due to the limitations of climate and soil, the quality of its tea is still inferior to Chinese tea in terms of color, aroma, and taste. Therefore, recently, there has been renewed interest in this type of tea. Unfortunately, the inventory in this area is insufficient, so transactions have not yet begun, but market sentiment is steadily improving. Other types of tea are also following suit and showing good performance. As for domestic tea sales, although the dealers are still trying to push prices up, the increase has already been significant after consecutive days of rising. In addition, it seems that the buyers' capacity has been sufficient, so the market lacks the momentum to rise further. As a result, various types of tea are returning to their original routes.

### Tight Money Supply Dampens Sentiment, Yarn, Cloth, Experience a General Decline

Yesterday's cotton market conditions saw a continuing tight money supply, with no real progress in sales. Local merchants showed a lack of interest, and bulls continued to take profits, leading to a sluggish market sentiment.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially saw a sharp price decline of 100 million due to rumors of a new economic control plan to be announced soon, with the physical market still under many restrictions and general floating longs eager to unload. Unexpectedly, after opening lower, buyers remained unmoved, and prices fell another 50 million. Near the close, buyers added to their positions at lower prices, recovering to 2 billion, ultimately closing at 1.92 billion yuan, a decline of 80 million yuan compared to the previous day.

21-count Double Horse yarn saw weak demand after opening, with initial gains of 10 million. Subsequently, due to the Spinning and Weaving Company dumping yarn at 80 million below the market price, market sentiment turned worried, and the trend lacked momentum. It ultimately settled at 1.51 billion, down a small 60 million yuan from the previous day. Other counts of leased yarn and fine yarn also declined, ranging from 30 to 40 million to 70 to 80 million, with only 52 transactions.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw tighter control over banks and financial institutions by the authorities, leading to a contraction in lending. Actual sales in the local market were sluggish, and dyeing factories were also mostly watching and waiting. Hankou merchants took advantage of the high prices to sell, while Tianjin merchants sold fine cloth to hedge against Yuan Zhi Gong Ni. As a result, Gongtou fine cloth opened higher but then fell all the way to 53.7 million, a decline of 1.8 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Mid-range Five Blessing and Trumpet Boy fine cloth, which had deviated too much from Longtou, attracted hedging purchases from peers, and the market once showed signs of improvement. As a result, Five Blessing fell by 1.5 million, and Trumpet Boy fell by a small 1 to 2 million. Other piqué, fine twill, and shilin cloth all showed a trend of declines exceeding gains.

Further news: In the afternoon over-the-counter market, Longtou fine cloth was quoted at 54.8 million, falling to 4 million, a gain of 300,000 yuan compared to the noon close.

Further news: The Spinning and Weaving Company's tender for Five Blessing fine cloth had a quoted price of 44.5 million yuan, and Sijun ten yuan piqué was 53.5 million to 4.5 million yuan. There were also 15 other types of Tiaoli bleached cloth, printed piqué, genuine quality, and 3A color ball fine cloth, etc., with very few applications.

Further news: The China Textile Corporation opened sales of 16 types of cotton yarn yesterday, issuing 344 purchase permits, selling 18,660 bolts of cloth and 100 quilts. Two purchase permits were issued to factories for 160 bolts of cotton cloth, for a total of 346 purchase permits for 18,820 bolts of cotton cloth and 100 quilts, valued at 98,713 million yuan. It also sold three types of yarn on behalf of the Yarn Tube Association, with 8 purchase permits, selling 49 pieces of yarn, valued at 6,706 million yuan.

### August Coal Allocation Prices Increase by 170%

Yesterday, a person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee told reporters that the adjustment of the cost of living index and the direct increase in commodity prices have caused huge expenses for mine operators in various coal-producing areas, making it impossible to sustain operations. Therefore, the mine operators have requested the Fuel Management Committee to make reasonable adjustments to the allocation prices and production area prices for coal in August, increasing them by at least three times to barely support operations, otherwise they will have to stop production. However, the Fuel Management Committee believes that the increase requested by the mine operators is too large and will affect price increases, making it difficult to accept in full. After discussions at a meeting held the other day, it has been generally decided as of yesterday afternoon to allow an increase of 170%. The new prices will be implemented starting today.

### Materials and Finance Committee Drafts Principles for Material Loans

[This Newspaper Report] The National Bank's Materials and Finance Committee held its fourth meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday, chaired by convener Li Lixia. The meeting approved the principle of providing loans for grain purchases primarily in the form of physical goods. It also drafted general principles for material loans, which will be decided upon after soliciting the opinions of the bank's Discount and Loan Committee.

### Slow Sales and Scarce Transactions, Rice Market Stable, Flour, Grain, Oil, and Cake Prices All Downstream

The rice market lacked momentum to rise. After opening, it continued the strong close of the previous day, and merchants continued to call for higher prices. However, sales were very slow, and after fluctuating, the market weakened. Declines in various commodities outside the industry made people feel uneasy and tired. Rice shops experienced weak sales due to the beginning of the distribution of household rice for this month, and their appetite for inventory was very weak, resulting in very scarce transactions. As a result, prices rose slightly by 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The arrival of new japonica rice gradually increased, resulting in a unique decline of 1 million yuan. Indica rice transactions were scarce, and prices were stable. Yesterday's arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 5,915 piculs.

Flour was weak and declined, with sluggish actual sales and slow inventory turnover. Declines in various commodities outside the industry made people feel tired, so the market entered a weak state after opening and ultimately declined by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Old brand flour closed at 13.7 million, down 300,000 yuan. Battleship flour opened at 12.7 million, once reaching 12.9 million, but ultimately closed at the opening price, down 450,000 yuan. Bran fell by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.

Grains declined across the board. Buyers' appetite was poor, and local sales were also weak. The market weakened from虚. Yellow soybean mills also had thin stomachs, ultimately falling by 1.5 to 2 million. Broad beans fell by 500,000, red sorghum fell by 1 million, and corn and barley from the north did not sell well, falling by 2 million yuan. Although mung bean prices were stable, sales were also slow. Sesame was slightly mixed, but generally fell by 1 to 2 million. Raw peanuts had a lot of returned goods the previous day, so they fell by 6 to 7 million yuan yesterday.

Edible oil declined due to declines in soybeans and other grains, coupled with lower prices in various commodities outside the circle, making people feel very depressed. Raw oil declined even more due to arrivals, with Jitong raw oil closing at 110 million, a sharp decline of 10 million. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil had a lot of returned goods sold off, each falling by 3 million yuan. Soybean oil was mostly at 86 million, and small-batch sesame oil fell by 6 million yuan. Soybean cake had more sales than purchases, falling by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.

### Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit Have Not Yet Been Issued

Import and Export Industry Demands Prompt Issuance

[This Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Import and Export Association reports that the Central Trust Bureau has not yet issued the special foreign currency certificates of deposit for the price that should be paid to the original importers for goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange without licenses, which was supposed to be paid. The Association previously telegraphed the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau to issue them promptly. Now, after a long time, they have still not been issued. Recently, newspaper reports have suggested that the authorities are planning to convert these outstanding foreign currency certificates of deposit into legal tender at the exchange rate of the Equalization Fund. The Association is deeply concerned that if this is true, not only will related businesses suffer significant losses, but the government's credit will also be damaged. Yesterday, they specially submitted a document to the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau, requesting that all special foreign currency certificates of deposit that should be paid to the original importers be issued promptly and that they continue to be used to offset import quotas as originally stipulated, in order to demonstrate the government's creditworthiness and strengthen the confidence of businesses and the public.

### Leading All the Way, Initial Good News Reported, Our Basketball Team Defeats Belgium, 36 to 34 in Overtime, Li Shiqiao's Appearance Greatly Boosts Morale

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] Our World Games basketball team defeated the Belgian team at the Harringay Arena last night, with a fierce battle lasting 45 minutes before a winner could be decided. Finally, in the five-minute overtime period, they narrowly defeated the Belgian team with a score of 36 to 34. The entire process was extremely tense. The addition of forward Li Shiqiao as a fresh force greatly enhanced the team's strength. Throughout the entire game, our team maintained the lead, indicating that the victory was not accidental. With seven minutes remaining in the game, our team was still leading by seven points, but afterwards, the shots were inaccurate, and we were unable to score. The Belgian team scored three goals and one free throw in a final effort, tying the game. After the five-minute overtime period, our team scored two goals, exceeding the opponent by four points. The opponent also scored one goal, ultimately losing to our team by two points. The game was fast-paced and intense from the start. After Huang Tianxi won the jump ball, our team immediately took the initiative, but because of inaccurate shots, we were unable to score. The Belgian team scored first, creating a record. Li Shiqiao and Cai Wenhua (captain) each scored a goal, coming from behind. After that, our team maintained the lead, with the forwards taking quick shots and having good form, making it difficult for the Belgian team to defend. In the first half, the score was 18 to 13, with our team leading by five points. After the break, our team added two more points, and the forwards' clever passes and shots were greatly praised by the audience. Near the end of the game, Huang Tianxi was fouled out, which had an immediate impact on the entire team. With four minutes remaining in the game, the Belgian team made a strong comeback, tying the score at 32 to 32. After the overtime period, our team sealed the victory with two free throws, and the Belgian team ultimately lost. The main reasons for our team's victory were the effective control under the basket by guards Huang Tianxi and Bao Songyuan, and the good coordination and accurate shooting of forwards Cai, Li, and Wu. Also, the highest scorer in last night's game was Cai Wenhua with 15 points, Li Shiqiao scored points, and Wu Chengwei scored 7 points.

[United Press, London, 2nd] The Chinese basketball team played against the Belgian team on the evening of the 2nd. Li Weiqiao, the "small but mighty" general of China at five feet two inches, recovered from his illness and took to the court. The Chinese and Belgian teams put on a wonderful performance, with little to separate them. In overtime, China finally defeated Belgium 36 to 34. The Chinese team took the lead, but the Belgian team caught up later, adding points frequently. At the end of regulation, the score was tied at 32 to 32. In overtime, it was generally believed that the physically strong Belgians would win, but they underestimated the "Little Li" and "Old Bao" of the Chinese team. Bao Songyuan was awarded two free throws. "Old Bao" lived up to expectations amidst the cheers of 1,500 spectators, scoring two swishes, making the score 34-32. Li Shiqiao followed suit, also earning a free throw opportunity, and did the same, scoring both free throws, making the score 36-32. The Belgian Zylber was unwilling to be outdone, scoring a goal with one hand, bringing the score to 36-34. As the Belgian team advanced into Chinese territory, the bell rang, ending the game. China won by one goal, 36 to 34, over Belgium.

[United Press, London, 2nd] After the Chinese basketball team narrowly defeated the Belgian team on the evening of the 2nd, Belgium made an astonishing move to file a protest with World Games officials regarding the outcome of the match. Belgium's protest is scheduled to be heard at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The reasons for the Belgian team's protest will not be announced until then.

### Basketball Upset: Chile Soundly Defeats Philippines, USA Barely Beats Argentina

[United Press, London, August 3rd] The Chilean basketball team, previously unknown, suddenly appeared in peak form on the 2nd, defeating the Philippine team, who were considered strong contenders for the group championship, by a score of 68 to 39.  With this victory, Chile is expected to advance to the final eight. Every member of the Chilean team scored at least once, especially Menghana, who put on an outstanding performance, scoring 18 points individually. The Philippine team played unusually poorly. Due to their smaller stature, they lost possession of most rebounds, and their previously excellent shooting skills seemed to have disappeared. In the early part of the first half, the Philippine team took the lead with a score of 6 to 4. However, Menghana, like a tiger released from its cage, scored from various angles with great ease. With free throws and field goals, Chile took the lead and maintained control of the game throughout, leading 29 to 16 at halftime. In the second half, Chile continued to press on, with Leidema and Jiale also contributing significantly. As a result, the Philippines suffered a devastating defeat with a final score of 39 to 68.

[United Press, London, August 3rd] The seemingly invincible American basketball team almost suffered a Waterloo on the 3rd. Fortunately, their luck turned in the last minute, narrowly defeating the Argentinian team by a score of 59 to 57.

Basketball Outlook

[Central News Agency, London, August 3rd] The Philippine basketball team, which had attracted much attention, unexpectedly lost to Chile today with a score of 39 to 68. When our basketball team made its debut on the 30th of last month, they also lost to Chile by a narrow margin of five points. However, their star forward, Li Shiqiao, was unable to play due to illness that day. Our national basketball team, along with the Philippines, Korea, Chile, and Iraq, are in Group B. Last night, we defeated Belgium 36 to 34. Iraq is considered the weakest team among the six in the group and has already been defeated by Korea and the Philippines by a large margin. Therefore, our team's easy victory over Iraq was expected. If our team can defeat Korea tonight, their chances of qualifying for the finals will become clearer.

[United Press, London, August 3rd] In the Olympic basketball tournament, Belgium defeated Iraq by a large margin, 98 to 20.

[Central News Agency, London, August 2nd, United Press] In today's basketball games, Canada unexpectedly lost to Hungary. Canada was generally considered the second strongest team in the Olympics after the United States. Now, they might not even make it to the semi-finals. Hungary, previously overlooked, now has a great chance of entering the basketball championship game. Hungary only lost to Brazil by a score of 47 to 41. The United States defeated Czechoslovakia 53 to 28, and France defeated Cuba 37 to 31.

[French News Agency, London, August 3rd] In today's Olympic basketball games, Peru defeated Switzerland 40 to 19, Mexico defeated France 56 to 42, and Belgium defeated Iraq 98 to 20. Uruguay defeated Italy 46 to 34.

### Our Soccer Team Meets Strong Opponent: Loses to Turkey 4-0: Turkish Army Lives Up to Its Reputation; Formidable Strength

[Central News Agency, London, August 3rd] In the preliminary round of soccer, our team lost to Turkey 4-0. The match took place yesterday afternoon at the Wassam Seven Road Stadium. The strong Turkish team incredibly scored three goals within five minutes in the second half. Our team was able to resist the Turkish team in the first half, with the Turkish team only scoring one goal at the end of the 45 minutes. Overall, if it weren't for the outstanding defense of goalkeeper Zhang Banglun and defender Hou Rongsheng, our team would have conceded even more goals. Hou's performance at right back was particularly outstanding, and Zhang made many important saves. In the second half, the Turkish team's offensive became more intense. Within four minutes, they scored two goals from 25 yards out, and less than two minutes later, they scored another goal. Twenty-five minutes into the second half, our team's left winger, Zhu Yongqiang, was injured and had to leave the field, leaving us to play with ten men. Both teams were hampered by the muddy field after the rain, which affected their agility. After the start of the game, the Turkish forwards immediately launched an attack on our defense. Fortunately, Hou Rongsheng managed to kick the ball out several times. In total, the Turkish team attempted to score at least six times in the first half, only scoring one goal in the 18th minute. Our team also attempted to score several times, but failed to break the deadlock. In the last few minutes of the second half, our team stepped up its attack, but was unable to break through the Turkish team's strong defense. Zhu Yongqiang's injury had a significant impact on our attack. Although our forwards made a final effort before the end of the game, they were unable to penetrate the opponent's defense and get a shooting opportunity.

[Report from This Newspaper] London, August 3rd Broadcast: The Chinese soccer team was defeated by Turkey 4-0 in the rain yesterday and was eliminated in the first week. The score was 0-1 at halftime. In the other three games of the first week, Sweden, Italy, and Korea were victorious.

Corner Kicks and Headers: Turkish Team's Masterpiece

China's defeat was due to the failure of its forwards to break through Turkey's central defense. Even when good opportunities arose, they failed to calmly seize them and take effective shots. On the defensive end, their headers were weak, which turned every high ball into a Turkish opportunity. The Turkish winger Guelson's well-placed corner kicks were especially difficult for the Chinese defenders to handle. The first goal was scored by Turkish center forward Hillary Kelek, who headed the ball in from a corner kick.

Under the close watch of the Turkish defenders, the Chinese forwards also failed to perform well. Although Zhu Yongqiang was closely marked, He Yingfen and Xie Wenliang both had several good shots, but they were all saved by the Turkish goalkeeper. At the end of the first half, Liu Songsheng even hit the crossbar. The Turkish team lived up to its reputation. Its strength was comparable to that of a professional English team. Their corner kicks and headers were particularly impressive, and their forwards were especially fierce and terrifying.

Yongqiang Shut Down: The Forward Line Shattered

The match began at 6:30 PM at Watson Steel Stadium. The constant drizzle made the field wet and the ball heavy, which affected the smaller, more agile Chinese players significantly. The Turkish team had many burly players, which gave them an advantage on the slippery field. China attacked first, but was blocked by the Turkish defenders. Zhu Yongqiang made several aggressive runs, but without success. This attracted the attention of the Turkish defenders, and he was closely marked by Igen, a large Turkish center back. From then on, the two were inseparable, and the Chinese forward line was broken up, reducing the threat to the Turkish defense.

Header Opens the Score: Record Broken

With the first half nearing its end, Turkey launched a counterattack. The five forwards infiltrated the Chinese defense with crisp, short passes. Center forward Hillary Kelek shot hard near the goal, and Zhang Banglun made a flying save, conceding a corner kick. Just as China was relieved to have escaped danger, Guelson sent in an excellent corner kick, and Hillary Kelek was perfectly positioned to head the ball into the net, opening the scoring. China launched a full-scale counterattack. He Yingfen and Liu Songsheng both had attempts on goal, but they were saved by the goalkeeper. They also gained two corner kicks, but their headers were unsuccessful. In the final minute, Liu Songsheng had a great shot, and the goalkeeper was unable to save it. It looked like the ball was going to go in and equalize the score, but unfortunately, it hit the crossbar by a hair's breadth, causing the crowd to sigh in disappointment.

Banglun Busy: Another Three Goals Conceded

At the beginning of the second half, Zhang Banglun made a spectacular save, bravely diving at the feet of Guelson to clear a dangerous ball. A few minutes later, Zhang made another diving save, earning a round of applause from the crowd.

Seventeen minutes later, Hillary Kelek scored again with a shot from 20 yards out, hitting the upper left corner. The Chinese team was visibly shaken by this blow, and the Turkish team seized the opportunity to attack again and score another goal, making it 3-0. Finally, Turkish player An Tonyaddis scored a goal in the scramble near the goal, sealing the victory with a score of 4-0 and advancing to the second week, where they will face Sweden.

Free Talk · Monologue by Ji Yong

In these sweltering days, rats are running rampant, even daring to climb onto beds and into mosquito nets. As a result, I lie awake all night, listening to the snores of my neighbors, feeling extremely miserable. This reminds me of Qu Yuan's famous line, "Everyone is drunk, but I alone am sober," which is truly an unbearable situation. No wonder he angrily went to Peng Xian's abode to practice swimming.

Imagine a situation where "Everyone is sober, but I alone am drunk." What would that be like? Undoubtedly, I would be laughed at and ridiculed by the sober people. At banquets, we often see such jokes among those with a low alcohol tolerance who still like to overindulge. However, the person in question doesn't feel any pain because he's already drunk. Being drunk is being muddled, and being muddled is "hard-earned." While we find him laughable, he might be feeling ecstatic, thinking he's amazing. Outsiders may see it as a tragedy, but the person involved doesn't feel it at all. What is considered bitter or sweet is subjective. Finding joy in a situation that others find miserable is like getting an unexpected fortune when everyone else is struggling, which is cause for celebration. Perhaps they will feel embarrassed after sobering up, much like waking up from the Nanke dream or when the yellow millet is cooked in the Yellow Millet Dream, a grand performance has been experienced. Even mentioning it brings a pleasant kind of embarrassment. There's a passage in "Suiyuan Poetry Talk" about a wall inscription in Handan that says, "Forty years of duke and marquis, although it's a dream, it's still romantic. Now I'm down on my luck in Handan, I need to borrow a pillow from you, sir!" This actually represents the desires and psychology of most people and is not just a mere renovation of old ideas, as Yuan Mei praised. After Yue Zhongqi was dismissed from office, he was reinstated and sent to conquer Dajinchuan and Xiaojinchuan. When he passed through Handan, he also wrote a verse: "Just because I haven't finished worldly affairs, I'm dreaming of becoming a marquis again." This is clearly a coquettish statement. Everyone understands the difference between the mortal world and the divine realm. Being a marquis in the human world is the same as being a god; otherwise, everything is negated. So, although being drunk is not considered wise, the reason why most people flock to it is because there's a great deal of cause in it.

It's the sober ones who suffer. While everyone else enjoys the pleasure of the Handan dream, you're the only one listening to the rats squeaking, gnawing on books in the drawer, and watching the eerie twinkling stars, feeling suffocated and sweating. Isn't that even harder? As the saying goes, "How can I tolerate others sleeping soundly beside my bed?" This sentiment is indeed disgusting. Even if it's not my bed but my neighbor's, I still can't stand hearing it, let alone someone comfortably rolling around on my bed! If it were not a sound sleep but wakefulness, then that would be a different story. The ancients had methods like sharing a bed for late-night talks or listening to the rain together, how good it would be to have a companion! The problem is that those who come to occupy my bed are rarely there to talk to me and ease my worries, but mostly there to borrow a pillow to indulge in their dream addiction. This is why it's unforgivable and intolerable. Perhaps this is what Qu Yuan was talking about?

Moreover, it's said that dreams are when the human subconscious is active, and reason loses its effect. When awake, you're Tao Yuanming, but when drunk or asleep, why can't you be Shi Miyuan, Liu Yu, Yi Kuang, or Jia Sidao? Not willing to bend over for five pecks of rice is only because it's too little - nowadays, it's twenty million! - if it were fifty pecks of rice, you might just bend over in a flash! Saying one thing so loudly, how can you immediately slap yourself in the face? Now that you're drunk and dreaming, not only can others forgive you, but you can even find reasons to excuse yourself. In novels, people are often told, "Don't blame it on being drunk and dreaming!" This shows that if you're really drunk and dreaming, you might be able to get understanding. Wise readers should understand that the reason being drunk is not as good as being awake lies in this, and the reason being awake is even worse than being drunk lies especially in this! In this way, the awake person is even harder to deal with against the majority of drunk and dreaming people - right and wrong are determined by the majority. Ibsen's theorem "The minority is always right" is just a complaint and can't be put into the rules of procedure. - Black can be turned into white, white can be turned into black. The clay pot and dull knife that Jia Yi and Qu Yuan were angry about, and the regrettable yellow bell and Moxie sword, are probably due to this. How can one cope with what is called "using a clear heart to receive the dirt of things!" In this situation, besides finding Peng Xian to go swimming, there's probably only one medicine that can cure it - sleeping pills.

The price of sleeping pills is also rising; I can't afford them. Otherwise, I would really make up my mind.

The Big Scale by Ruyi

In the sixteenth century, Europeans made a point of hunting and killing witches, claiming that witches had magic and often flew through the air on broomsticks. A woman suspected of being a witch was often burned alive by the public, and even if she was truly innocent, she had no chance to defend herself. However, some wise officials, seeing that they could not violate public anger, came up with a clever method: they erected a large scale in the downtown area. After the crowd caught a "witch," those officials would kindly ask them to weigh the woman. After weighing her, they would announce her weight and declare that such a heavy body could not possibly ride a broomstick and fly - the crowd had nothing to say, and the woman's life was saved. Even today, you can still see these scales in the villages and thoroughfares of the Netherlands.

Remembering Alian by Zi Jiao

Knowing three or five characters, she's always busy learning to write, the clay doll sharpens the pencil, asks her mother to find paper. She suddenly wants to use the toilet while eating, and asks for candy again when she gets into bed. People say she's pretty, and she's happy wearing new clothes. She talks to herself and carefully examines herself in the mirror.

She takes off her little socks while sitting, and drags her adult shoes while walking. She rolls her cloth pillow and quilt, and coaxes her doll to sleep. She tears half a piece of paper, and wipes her snot on her grandfather's coat. She goes up and up the railing, and asks her mother if she is being obedient. Sometimes she cries loudly, wanting her mother to go to the street.

She eats vegetables first while eating, and doesn't move the rice when the vegetables are gone. It takes a long time to feed her a meal, and the ground is covered as if with seeds. She clucks and clucks, calling for the chickens, and spoils them even when she's angry. Put her on the ground and she shrugs her shoulders and jumps for joy.

Her seven hands and eight feet get water all over her when washing clothes, and she doesn't care when her mother scolds her, saying she can do it too. She watches her grandfather paint orchids and laughs at him for not being able to paint them like her. She needs help to see the sun and moon, and thinks of a fairy in the sky. Her grandfather has a hard heart, regretting she wasn't a boy. Tears fall like strings from his venerable side, and Alian stares blankly. Her grandfather is an excellent scholar, regretting that she's not a boy!

Russell on the Scientific Temperament by Ze Shi

Since the news that the "non-eating" Yang Mei was not actually not eating, I have seen many articles mocking Chinese scientists for being unscientific, arguing that, according to science, people absolutely cannot live without eating, and that Chinese scientists were making a big fuss about the "non-eating" Yang Mei, which is absolutely unscientific.

I don't understand science, and I dare not comment on whether Chinese scientists' enthusiasm for the Yang Mei incident is in line with science. It just so happened that tonight I was reading Russell's "Skeptical Essays," in which Chapter 12, on "Free Thought and Official Propaganda," mentions the scientific temperament. I thought it might be worth copying. He says: (According to Yan Jicheng's translation, Commercial Press edition)

"In recent years, we have had an excellent example that can be used to illustrate the scientific temperament in our minds, and that is the theory of relativity and its popularity in the world. Einstein, the proposer of the theory of relativity... the predictions about the theory of relativity... were confirmed by the British expedition sent to observe the solar eclipse of 1919. His theory destroyed the entire framework of traditional physics; it was almost as unfavorable to orthodox dynamics as Darwin's theory was to the biblical Genesis. However, physicists all over the world, after the evidence obtained was proved to be in its favor, expressed a very quick attitude of recognition, and did not harbor any resentment because it overturned the entire physical framework that thousands of scientists had worked so hard to build. However, none of these many supporters of the theory of relativity believed that Einstein had achieved the final and most complete success - Einstein especially would not think so. He did not build a monument of permanently indestructible beliefs that could stand for thousands of years. In today's physics, there are still some problems that he cannot solve; in the future, there will always be a day when his theory will be modified, just as it is currently modifying Newton's theory. This kind of critical, non-dictatorial humility is the true attitude of science."

He also says:

"A true scientist with a scientific perspective will never fail to acknowledge with utmost humility that the scientific knowledge that is considered acceptable today must be revised and supplemented with the progress of discovery... The place where we can find the closest to pure knowledge today is only in science, and in science, human attitudes and perspectives can only be regarded as experimental and full of errors." Russell's words are certainly not golden rules - Russell himself especially would not think so. But as a view of the scientific temperament that is different from ours, I think it is worth reading, and if I were one of the scientists studying Yang Mei, I would especially cite it to deal with those who mock me.

Not Seeking Detailed Understanding by Qian Dacheng

Tao Yuanming claimed that he did not seek detailed understanding when reading books, so later those who read books carelessly all claimed that they did not "seek detailed understanding." In fact, this is a big mistake. The "detailed" that Yuanming spoke of is the "detailed" in "Lao Tzu's departure is too detailed," which is also the "excessive" in Confucianism's "excess is as bad as deficiency." Understanding the ancients through reading should be just right, not far-fetched or deeply convoluted. The first thing is to grasp the meaning of the ancients, not to "carve a boat to seek a sword." As Yuanming said, "There is true meaning in this, but I have forgotten the words to express it." Seeking detailed understanding is being meticulous about the words of the ancients and forgetting their meaning. The Thirteen Classics and their commentaries are an effort to seek detailed understanding, but as a result, the meaning of the ancients becomes even more obscure. Feng Hao's annotations of Li Shangyin's poems are an effort to seek detailed understanding, but the result is that readers are even more confused and lost in a fog. The root cause of this problem is being far-fetched. Autocratic emperors also sought detailed understanding of the writings of dissidents. For example, Emperor Taizu of Ming suspected that a monk was mocking him for being a monk and a thief in his thanksgiving memorial, which contained the two sentences: "Heaven created a sage to be a model for the world." His reasoning was that "birth" and "monk," and "model" and "thief" are homophones. Emperor Shizong of Qing also sentenced a civil service examination invigilator to death for setting the question "Where the people live," because he believed that the two characters "Wei" and "Zhi" cut off the head of "Yongzheng." This is deep convolution. The era in which Yuanming lived was full of the atmosphere of "far-fetched interpretations" in terms of academics and "deep convolution" in terms of politics. He himself was a liberal, breathing in the atmosphere of Lao Zhuang, accepting the traditions of Confucius and Mencius, melting Taoism and Confucianism into one, striving for "moderation" and striving to "remove excess." The highest realm of any academic thought and art in the world is being just right. Yuanming's greatness lies in this. The later generations' lack of detailed understanding when reading books is just a way for those who have not achieved anything in reading to excuse themselves by borrowing Yuanming's words.

The attitude of observing world affairs should also be not seeking detailed understanding. Not experiencing it at all is being muddled; being too shrewd will inevitably lead to being sharp and critical. Only with the state of mind of "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains" can one reach the state of "having been caged for a long time, returning to nature."

I have already said a lot, and saying more will inevitably lead to seeking detailed understanding. Let's stop here.

Two Little Dots by Shi Jimi

We are as demanding of those we love most as we are of those we hate most, and it seems that we are even less forgiving of the former.

Listen, you who love beauty: if you want people to praise your beauty, it is best that you have no kindness, no sincerity, no talent... In this way, people will remember only your beauty.

If you have a peaceful heart, you can still enjoy tranquility and peace even in the most bustling city.

A pearl has no brilliance, but it has its own inner splendor.

Is calling a servant to have dinner with you the same as eliminating the class system? Can giving a beggar woman on the street 10,000 yuan be called a great philanthropist?

Few women still have themselves after marriage, because they remember themselves too much, so they cannot become good wives and mothers. - So after a woman gains a last name, she mostly loses her individuality.

Being Friendly to the People by Diao Ying

Being an editor of a publication can sometimes feel very dull.

Hollywood movie star Thomas Mitchell was originally an editor. The publication he edited was called "The Woodbridge Weekly." One day in 1913, he felt extremely bored, so he went for a walk on the beach in New Jersey. He picked up a clam and put it on the sand to see if it would walk back to the sea. He sat on the sand, watching quietly.

Suddenly, he heard footsteps on the sand, and someone asked him what he was doing. But Mitchell was too lazy to look up and just grunted.

The person squatted down in front of him.

Everyone was silent for a long time. The person said, "This is the first time I've seen such a lazy guy."

After a while, Mitchell said, "That's right."

The two started talking sarcastically. The person became impatient and imitated Mitchell's lazy tone of voice. But Mitchell still refused to look up at him. Finally, the person asked Mitchell, "Where do you work?"

Mitchell said slowly, "In Woodbridge. I edit a magazine. What about you?"

The person said, "I used to mess around at Princeton University. Now I've finally found a good job. I'm the president."

Mitchell couldn't help but look up, and in front of him was indeed the smiling Wilson!

In addition to affecting prices, the "second round of large-scale currency printing" has also lost the standard value of "easy exchange." It is inevitable and natural that real objects and spot goods will take their place.

The trend of discussing rent in terms of "flour" has been popular for a long time. Although the government has banned it several times, it has gradually become a dead letter. People say that those who "eat roof tiles" (northerners call those who live off rent "eating roof tiles") are ruthless and mercenary. However, the education sector is an intellectual class, and private primary and secondary schools openly and secretly demand tuition fees in "flour!" In comparison, the moneylenders are not worth criticizing. Primary schools require at least one bag per term, and secondary schools require three bags. This is the most common. However, a certain church school in Dongcheng requires as many as eight bags per term, so the others that only require three or four bags are relatively "cheap." (However, although church schools charge high fees, applicants are more enthusiastic. This mentality can be compared with the fact that Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University have a stronger appeal than other private universities.)

It is not surprising that "collecting tuition fees" and "collecting rent" both adopt the "flour-worshipping principle," as the matter is close to common customs. On the one hand, "demanding flour" can reduce the stimulation of large numbers. After all, the tuition fees for a secondary school for one semester "require hundreds of millions!" Even if they are converted to the price of flour, it is understandable, but it would take too much effort to explain, so it is better to simply "demand flour!" which implies an explanation and is also very practical, which is a win-win situation. (Before the incidents, church secondary schools charged more than 20 yuan per term, which was also equivalent to the price of eight bags of flour at that time.) On the other hand, the standard of real objects has become a common trend among the public and private sectors, and since grain taxes have been levied in kind, government employees are more enthusiastic about insisting on in-kind allocations (flour, cloth, oil, salt, etc.) than adjusting currency numbers. As for rickshaw drivers' bargaining, they open their mouths for two or three hundred thousand, and then follow up with the ratio of "one catty of mixed flour," which is already an unspoken common expression.

What was formerly known as "gold-worshiping" should now be changed to "flour-worshiping" (in Jiangnan it may be "rice-worshiping"?), because even gold money is inferior to the rise in food prices. The second is "gold-worshiping," but this gold is gold, US dollars (also money but with the use of gold), and "white gold" (silver, especially round ones, which are in line with needs). As for domestically produced "paper gold," although it is still in circulation, most people express an attitude of not "worshiping" it.
