### Annual Budget Proposal for the Second Half of the Year: Legislative Yuan to Begin Review Today; Central Government Will Still Subsidize Local Finances

[Our Nanjing Office, August 8th] The general budget proposal for the central government's revenue and expenditure, as well as the special revenue and expenditure budget proposal for the second half of the thirty-seventh year of the Republic (1948), have undergone a general review by the joint meeting of all committees of the Legislative Yuan. It has now entered the stage of group reviews. The Budget Committee has decided to simultaneously convene seven group review meetings starting at 3:00 PM on the 9th, conducting continuous secret reviews for three or four days. Heads of relevant government agencies will also be invited to attend relevant review groups to provide explanations as needed. The allocation of work for the initial review by the seven groups, decided by the joint meeting of all committees of the Legislative Yuan, is as follows: Group 1 will review the budgets under the jurisdiction of the Presidential Office, Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Control Yuan, Examination Yuan, Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Ministry of Audit, and Ministry of Justice, as well as expenditures for civil servant retirement and death benefits, and expenditures related to the exercise of political power. Group 2 will review the budgets under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Land Affairs, Ministry of Health, Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Group 3 will review the budget under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense.

On the 15th, the joint meeting of all committees of the Legislative Yuan will convene for the final review. On the afternoon of the 16th, the general report will be submitted to the Yuan for discussion and resolution. The arrangement of this schedule has advanced the date of submitting the general review report to the Yuan, two days earlier than the originally planned 18th, so that all members can focus on completing the budget review and then concentrate on handling important pending bills, with the aim of adjourning on the 20th as scheduled for the summer recess.

[Our Nanjing Office, August 8th] The Ministry of Finance will continue to adopt a discretionary subsidy method for local finances in provinces and counties in the second half of the year. Before the General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy are finalized, local finances in provinces and counties will continue to be handled according to the current revenue and expenditure system during the transitional period of the second half of the year. If revenue is insufficient, the central government will provide discretionary subsidies, as follows: (1) Budget Deficit Subsidy: A. Based on the key points for budget preparation in provinces and cities, a preliminary review of the budgets of each province and city will be conducted. On the revenue side, estimates should be based on the price trends in the second half of the year, and on the expenditure side, calculations should be based on the proposed plan. All insufficient deficits will be subsidized by the central government based on verified amounts. B. Adjustments to the cost-of-living subsidies in each province and city, in addition to the adjustments made in the first half of the year being included in the budgets of each province and city, adjustments to cost-of-living subsidies in the second half of the year should be specially reviewed and subsidized by the central government. C. For stable provinces and cities that are financially self-sufficient, the central government will no longer provide subsidies. (2) Broadly Raise Funds for Local Self-Defense Forces: A. The original security expenses in the first half of the year will still be listed in the provincial budget for the second half of the year. B. The newly added security expenses in the first half of the year will still be subsidized by the central government in accordance with the approved advance payment in the second half of the year. C. The expenses for the security corps that the Ministry of National Defense plans to add in the second half of this year will still be allocated and subsidized by the central government together with the expenses for the originally added security teams. (3) Subsidies for Pacification Zone Counties and Cities: A. County and City Subsidies: For recovered counties, subsidies will be provided once based on their respective county classifications. B. Tax Exemption Subsidies: Counties and cities that meet the regulations for tax exemption subsidies in pacification zones will continue to receive subsidies on a monthly basis according to the approved plan. For counties and cities that have been occupied but still maintain administrative institutions and self-defense forces, the central government will subsidize them according to established standards after verification.

### Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Shi Zhiquan, Arrives in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th] Shi Zhiquan (see photo), the newly appointed Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Ping at 3:30 PM on the 8th. Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, Duanmu Kai, Secretary-General, Xie Guansheng, Minister of Justice Administration (representing Gu Ruhun), Weng Jingtang, Chairman of the Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries, Xia Qin, President of the Supreme Court, and others greeted him at the airport. In response to reporters' inquiries, he said that the date of assuming his duties at the Yuan would be decided after consulting with President Wang. He also stated that the system of Grand Justices in the constitutional draft was initially based entirely on the American system (where Grand Justices manage trials and lawsuits, etc.). After modifications, the content was slightly changed. Grand Justices do not hear cases; their authority lies in interpreting the Constitution and laws. The position of Grand Justices is very important in the judiciary. The Constitution adopts a system of separation of five powers, and the judiciary should be independent. After the implementation of the Constitution, there are even clearer provisions. In the future, he will assist the President and strive to achieve the goal of judicial independence.

### Guan Jiyu Reports on Food Administration

Permits for Flour Transportation Have Been Suspended

[Our Nanjing Office, August 8th] Guan Jiyu, the Minister of Food, attended a press conference at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th to report on the general situation of food administration. Mr. Guan briefly explained two points: the characteristics of China's food problem and the actual situation of food sources, as well as the current food administration measures. Regarding the former, he stated that although China is an agricultural country, the actual amount of food produced is insufficient to meet the needs, and China's foreign trade in food is in deficit. Moreover, due to wars in various regions, there is a lack of coordination between food-deficient areas and food-producing areas, resulting in frequent food shortages. These are all characteristics of China's food problem. Next, Mr. Guan reported on the main current food administration measures one by one. Mr. Guan also explained that the Ministry of Food has suspended the issuance of permits for flour transportation, and those that have already been issued will be invalid after their expiration and will not be extended. Regarding transit transportation, the food distribution committees in the food-needy areas will purchase and transport the food themselves, or entrust the Farmers Bank of China to purchase and transport it on their behalf. Mr. Guan briefly talked about the future direction of food administration, which should focus on three aspects: quantity, price, and quality. In terms of quantity, it is necessary to raise enough real food to enrich the people's food supply and to establish a system of ever-normal granaries to lay the foundation for food security.

### Yanzhou Defends the Famous City; President Allocates 10 Billion for Reward; Railway Between Jinan and Jieshou Has Been Repaired

[Our Xuzhou Office, August 8th] Fierce battles continue in the west gate, south gate, and old gate of Yanzhou City. Yesterday, the bandits concentrated their artillery to bombard the city gates and cover the infantry's charge. The offensive was fierce as never before, but it was ultimately repelled by the defending troops. Yanzhou is as solid as a rock. President Chiang, in recognition of the Yanzhou National Army's firm defense of the city walls, their bloody battles with the bandits for more than ten days and nights, their repeated defeats of the bandit forces, and their defense of the famous city, has allocated 10 billion for rewards. The funds have been fully remitted to Xuzhou.

After eating it, the Madam expressed great satisfaction and specially took some back to share with the President. The President also used it to entertain foreign guests. Red rice is known to have extremely high nutritional value.

### Air Force Blockades Yellow River Crossing; Escape Route for Remaining Bandits in the Yellow River Flood Area Has Been Cut Off

[Our Xuzhou Office, August 8th] According to Air Force reconnaissance, the remnants of Chen Bandit's various units, which had crossed the Longhai Railway from the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan and were fleeing northeast, had largely reached the area between Caoxian and Kaocheng by the afternoon of the 8th and are continuing to flee north. The National Army's Qiu Qingquan Corps has crossed the Longhai Railway north this afternoon and advanced to the old Kaocheng area, pursuing and annihilating the bandits. The Air Force's Yellow Sea, East Sea, and Bohai Sea air groups have been taking turns flying over western Shandong all day to pursue and annihilate the fleeing bandits. The bandits have been forced to split into countless small groups. The Air Force is adopting a hunting-style attack, and bandit corpses are scattered everywhere. The Air Force is also strictly blockading all Yellow River crossings, cutting off the bandits' escape route. Today, seven bandit boats were bombed and sunk at Gaocun (on the south bank of the Yellow River) northwest of Dongming, and eighteen bandit boats were bombed and sunk at Zhangguantun on the north bank.

[Our Xuzhou Office, August 8th] In this great victory in eastern Henan, the National Army completely defeated the main forces of the thirteen columns of the Chen and Liu bandits. Preliminary statistics from the National Army show that 104,319 bandits were killed or wounded, 8,118 bandits were captured, and 5,861 rifles, 7,414 light machine guns, 314 heavy machine guns, 15 pistols, 384 submachine guns, and 60 artillery pieces were seized.

On the morning of the 8th, near Yindianji (north of Qixian and east of Lanfeng), the bandit rearguard of over 4,000 people was heavily surrounded and annihilated. The bandits stubbornly resisted, and after a fierce battle until 3:00 PM in the afternoon, over 1,000 bandits were killed, and the remnants fled north in disarray. In this battle, the National Army intercepted over 50 trucks and over 200 oxcarts loaded with supplies, as well as over 800 rifles, one light and heavy machine gun, and three mortars. Today, the Air Force strafed the fleeing bandits in the Dafanzhuang area (northeast of Mindi), killing over 500 bandits and destroying over 100 vehicles. The bandit formations were chaotic and in great distress. Some have occupied the vicinity of old Kaocheng, and we are intensifying the pursuit.

The bandits fled towards Xihua, and the National Army is in pursuit.

### Nanjing Xinmin Daily Newspaper Punished with Suspension for Repeatedly Publishing Content Violating Publication Law

[Our Nanjing Office, August 8th] The Nanjing Xinmin Daily newspaper was permanently suspended from publication on the 8th. According to sources from the Ministry of Interior, the newspaper has repeatedly published content propagandizing for the bandits, spreading rumors, and inciting the people. Recently, it has become even more intensified, falsely reporting facts, slandering the National Army, and hindering the suppression of rebellion. It has seriously violated Articles 21 and 23 of the Publication Law, which state that "publications shall not promote or record anything that harms the interests of the Republic of China or disrupts public order." Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 32 of the same law, it has been permanently suspended from publication. The Ministry of Interior issued the order at 5:30 PM on the 8th, instructing the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to implement it. The Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Capital Police Department, dispatched personnel to deliver the order to the person in charge of Xinmin Daily at 7:30 PM.

Statement by Spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior issued a statement regarding the suspension of the Nanjing Xinmin Daily newspaper, stating that the Nanjing Xinmin Daily has repeatedly published content propagating for the Communist bandits, spreading rumors, inciting the people, and demoralizing the military. It has also frequently carried news reports and opinions that sow discord between the people and local defense forces. Recently, it has become even more intensified, falsely reporting facts, slandering the National Army, and acting as a mouthpiece for the Communists. In order to allow the public to understand the truth and see through the facts, a summary explanation is provided as follows:

(1) Propagandizing for the Communist bandits and exaggerating the combat power of the bandit army. The article "Sawdust from the Dabie Mountains" published on June 10th actually promoted that the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's invasion of the Dabie Mountains had resulted in an expansion to 88,000 people. "Rumor that Zuo Yi and Nie Rongzhen are competing" on April 28th also promoted that Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops had expanded from 100,000 to 150,000 people. These are all promotional records that exaggerate the bandit forces and shake people's confidence. "Northeast from Spring to Summer" published on May 27th stated, "Under the principle that supply is more important than combat, over 90 percent of the 13,000 kilometers of railways in Northeast China are controlled by the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army is not only not destroying railways but is also repairing them." The fact that the Communist bandits are destroying railways everywhere, hindering transportation, is well-known to people at home and abroad. The newspaper is actually concealing the crimes of the Communist bandits and promoting the construction in the bandit areas. Who would believe that this is not acting as a mouthpiece for the bandits?

(2) Deliberately spreading rumors and disturbing the hearts of the people. Yichang is a major town between the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Henan. The Communist bandits have never invaded it, let alone besieged it. However, the newspaper claimed on June 26th that "the siege of Yichang has been lifted," a baseless rumor that was clearly intended to falsely report that Yichang was about to be besieged, fabricating facts and shaking the people's confidence. The article "Wild Winds in Hong Kong" in the newspaper on April 7th stated: "Leftists believe that the Communist bandits will definitely cross the Yangtze River, possibly as early as recently, and no later than May 1." This record is clearly an exaggeration and promotion for the bandits. It is now early July, and the Communist bandits have not only not crossed the Yangtze River, but after the failure of the bandit army in the Central Plains war, there is no hope of crossing the Yangtze River. This fact is sufficient to prove that the newspaper is exaggerating the bandit's strength and intending to intimidate. The article "Perspectives on the Defense of the Daba Mountains" on May 1 stated that the potential of the Communist bandits in Sichuan is very large, which is even more obviously intended to shake people's confidence and disturb the rear.

(3) Falsely reporting facts and slandering the National Army. The article "Northwestern Yunnan War Situation" in the newspaper on April 14th stated, "National Army District A is fighting desperately, District B is watching indifferently. Henan is tense, ignoring Shandong. Guanzhong is in a hurry, ignoring Luoyang," and also said, "The National Army is controlled by others." Also, in the article "Zhangjiakou Was Once Tense" on April 18th, it was stated, "Although there are many Communist bandits captured by the National Army, they are all National Army soldiers who were captured." These are all counter-propaganda that shakes the morale of the National Army. In addition, the newspaper article "Remembering the Wancheng Militia" wantonly insulted the militia, sowing discord between the military and the people, and implied the critical situation of Sichuan and Hubei after the bandit army occupied Wancheng, in order to exaggerate the bandit's strength. Furthermore, the article "Students Who Escaped from Kaifeng Talk About the Looting After Being Targeted by Artillery" on June 26th actually claimed that all the large and small buildings in the commercial district of Kaifeng were flattened by the Air Force's bombing, and 60,000 to 70,000 people were killed or injured. However, our Air Force did not engage in the indiscriminate bombing described by the newspaper, as evidenced by the remarks of Yao Congwu, the president of Henan University. The newspaper took advantage of the tense situation in the eastern Henan war to fabricate facts, attempting to incite society and mobilize public opinion to oppose the Air Force's bombing of the war zone. There are countless such remarks and news reports that spread rumors and mislead the public, hindering the suppression of rebellion.

The above is only a selection of the most prominent events. The Ministry has also recorded and filed other opinions, essays, news reports, and communications with similar natures and intentions, which can be consulted at any time. All of this is intentionally spreading rumors, shaking people's confidence, defaming the National Army, and hindering the suppression of rebellion. It violates Articles 21 and 23 of the Publication Law, which stipulate that publications must not promote or record propaganda that damages the interests of the Republic of China or disrupts public order. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 32 of the same law, it has been permanently suspended from publication.

The government protects freedom of speech and publication in accordance with the law, and has always cherished and supported the development of cultural and news undertakings. However, during this period of suppressing the rebellion, if there are any words or deeds that hinder military affairs or violate the law, we cannot bend the law to forgive them. We must impose sanctions in accordance with the law. This is what we must solemnly inform the people of today.

### Zhu Shaohou and Others Host a Banquet to Bid Farewell to All Sectors in Shaanxi

[Our Xi'an Office, August 8th] Zhu Shaohou and the heads of the Shaanxi Provincial Government hosted a grand banquet on the 8th to bid farewell to the heads of all sectors, gentry, and senators here. During the discussions on the current situation, they believed that the Qing court's situation during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was much stronger than the current situation. Zhang Xiangchu, a senior gentleman from Shaanxi, handed over the housing deed for the houses he donated for disaster relief during the banquet to Mr. Zhu for forwarding to the superiors.

### Han Air Force Dispatches Multiple Batches to Search for Bandit Traces in Southern Henan and Northern Hubei

[Our Hankou Office, August 8th] The local Air Force dispatched multiple batches to search for bandit traces in southern Henan and northern Hubei, and closely monitored the bandit troops fleeing east along the Tangbai River towards Xiangfan. Four newly built communication trenches were discovered north of Fancheng, extending directly to the edge of the city. Low-altitude strafing was immediately carried out, and many hidden bandits were killed. Subsequently, more than 80 bandits traveling south between Jingshan and Yingcheng were bombed and killed.

### British Confirmed to Have Illegally Built Roads on the Border of Kham and Tibet; Yunnan Provincial Government Submitted Report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs After Investigation

[Our Kunming Office, August 8th] Regarding the British illegal construction of roads in Geji, Ningyu, Bomi, and other places on the border of Kham and Tibet, the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters has telegraphed the Yunnan and Xikang Provincial Governments to collect evidence to facilitate negotiations. After receiving the order, the Yunnan Provincial Government instructed the five administrative bureaus adjacent to Kangyin, including Deqin, Baoshan, Fubai, Bijiang, and Lushui, to investigate. It has now been confirmed that the British, starting from Sadiya in the Arlongmi Province of India, have continued to build north along Ningyu towards Wasar. The conditions are to allow Tibetan merchants to transport 500 dan of wool and wool fabric annually, and to grant special export permits for guns, ammunition, cotton yarn, and musical instruments. A report has been submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting prompt and effective measures.

### General Review of the Central Plains Campaign Released by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense has recently released "General Review of the Central Plains Campaign," the full text of which is as follows:

(1) The Enemy's Intent

Since the bandit Liu Bocheng crossed the river and fled to Central China, he has been at a loss. Although the bandit gangs of Chen Yi and Chen Geng have continuously provided support, they have achieved little. Thus, starting from January of this year, Chen Yi gathered the bandit troops under his command, the 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns, and the Guangdong-Guangxi Rapid Column, as well as Liu Bocheng's bandit 11th Column and part of Chen's 3rd and 8th Headquarters, concentrated and reorganized them on the north bank of the Yellow River, strengthened training, and painstakingly planned to target our 5th and 18th Armies. After five months of replenishment and preparation, they crossed the river again to western Shandong in early June to carry out their so-called summer offensive conspiracy, to fight a decisive battle with our National Army, and to disrupt the National Army's June plan to clear Central China.

(2) The Enemy's and Our Situation

This time, the bandit Chen's intrusion into the Central Plains can be said to be an all-out attack. The main forces were the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th Columns, Guangdong-Guangxi, and Rapid Column, totaling six columns. The people in the border areas of Jin, Ji, Yu, and Lu were almost completely mobilized. On their left flank, Xu Shiyou, leading the New 7th, 8th, 9th, 13th, and other columns, besieged Yanzhou. The 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns attacked Kaifeng. Furthermore, Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns, and Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns, along with two columns dispatched by Xu Xiangqian from southern Jin, were deployed on the Pinghan Railway and its flanks to contain the National Army's reinforcements. In total, there were about twenty columns, with a total force of over 300,000 men. Before the intrusion, Zhu De personally went to western Shandong, gathered the officers and soldiers for a lecture, and vowed that he would not bear the surname Zhu again if the 5th Army was not annihilated. They first attacked Kaifeng and then proceeded to a decisive battle.

The National Army initially had an inferior strength. After ten days of fighting in western Shandong, the bandits gained nothing. Subsequently, the bandit 3rd, 8th, 10th, and other columns, which had intruded from western Henan, took advantage of the situation and captured Kaifeng. The National Army rushed to reinforce them overnight. The bandits then took the opportunity to gather in the Qixian and Suixian areas for a decisive battle with the National Army.

(3) Course of the Battle

Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, 6th Columns, Guangdong-Guangxi, and Rapid Column, and Liu Bocheng's 1st and 11th Columns, plus Chen Yi's 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns retreating from Kaifeng, and the local communist forces of Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, and others, totaled 150,000 men. Starting from the 28th of last month, they were surrounded by the National Army in the area between Suixian and Qixian and fiercely attacked. The bandit army struggled desperately. By the beginning of this month, the fighting had become increasingly fierce. The bandits successively sent reinforcements to Yuxiangpu, Longwangdian, and other places, using their superior forces to launch a counterattack against our forces left for dead. The two sides repeatedly charged and counter-charged, advanced and retreated. In the first three days, our 75th Division and the New 21st Brigade suffered heavy losses after five days of continuous fierce fighting. Subsequently, they were surrounded and夹击合力 by strong corps on the left and right wings toward Diqiudian (east of Yuxiangpu), Taolinggang (west of Yuxiangpu), and other places, coupled with the air force's fierce bombing. By July 4, the bandit army had suffered more than 40,000 casualties. After the 4th, the bandits fled in all directions within our counter-encirclement, unable to escape. Their food and ammunition were running out, supplies were difficult, casualties were everywhere, and desertions increased sharply. At this point, the bandits realized that the situation was over and could not be reversed. In addition, the air force continuously and fiercely bombed the bandit army's positions with large formations for several days, and the bandit's positions were completely destroyed. The bandit army's casualties were particularly heavy, and many of the bandit's high-level command posts were also destroyed. The bandits struggled until the morning of the 7th and could no longer sustain themselves, so they began a full-scale rout. Except for the remnants of Chen Yi's main force of six columns, which fled towards western Shandong, their 3rd and 8th Columns, and Liu's forces and the local communist bandits Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, and other bandit forces, fled south. The National Army is continuing to pursue them. The campaign has temporarily come to an end here.

(4) Review of the Campaign

From Xia Suixian, Qi, and Tongxu areas, corpses were scattered all over the fields, and the bandit army's military supplies and corpses were mixed and abandoned, covering the wilderness for fifty li in length and breadth. The scene was everywhere, indicating the misery of their defeat. Since the start of the campaign on the 26th of last month until the complete defeat of the bandits on the 7th, the total number of bandits wounded, killed, deserted, including militia and local communists, has exceeded 80,000. The 1st and 4th Columns lost more than half their strength, the 6th and Guangdong-Guangxi Columns lost nearly half their strength, and the 3rd, 8th, 10th, 11th, Rapid, and other columns each lost one-third of their strength, which is the greatest blow the bandits have suffered since their southward intrusion. Although the bandit army boasts of being good at replenishment, this time they have suffered a great loss of vitality and heavy casualties. It is feared that they will not be able to complete the reorganization in three months. Although we also lost one division and one brigade in this campaign, the ratio of casualties between us and the bandits is three to one, the bandits' attempt, prepared for half a year, has been shattered. The war situation in the Central Plains has turned from danger to safety in this victory. In the future, if the overall war in Central China can be effectively coordinated with the national mobilization, then the bandit army's future intrusions will be decisively struck everywhere.

The great battle in the Yellow River flood area of eastern Henan, after nine days and nights of bloody fighting and hunger by our loyal and brave soldiers, has finally achieved an unprecedented victory! This great victory not only shattered the enemy's attempt to threaten the area between the Yangtze, Huai, Xu, and Si Rivers from western Henan, but also achieved the initial task of capturing the enemy's main force for annihilation. The main force of 200,000 men under the command of the three bandits Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng, who had intruded into the area between Tongxu in the south and the two counties of Qi and Sui, has been annihilated by more than half. A part of the remnant bandits fled north across the Sea Road to western Shandong, and another part fled southwest from the Qi and Sui areas. The National Army is taking advantage of the victory and pursuing and suppressing the fleeing bandits in separate routes under the powerful cover of the air force. This decisive and unprecedented victory is being transmitted to all parts of the country on the anniversary of the July 7th Resistance War, and the people are invigorated and feel especially inspired. This is the greatest result of the anti-bandit military operations in the past year, and it is even more important than the great victory of annihilation in the Jingwei River Valley in early May this year. Some people compare it to the Battle of Feishui in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. In fact, this not only laid the foundation for the partial peace of the Eastern Jin Dynasty like the Battle of Feishui, but also stabilized Central China and restored North China. It is a turning point in the anti-bandit military operations in the past two years.

If we review the counter-insurgency military operations of the past year, the strategy adopted by the communists was originally a kind of "mobile warfare," flowing east and west. On the surface, it seems that there is no fixed goal, but in reality, the communists specialize in attacking the weak points of the National Army's defense line, taking advantage of weaknesses and attacking with "big" to eat "small." The so-called unexpected attack is not so mysterious. In fact, this kind of "mobile warfare" is the embodiment of the guerrilla warfare adopted by the communists in the past. The difference is that the purpose of guerrilla warfare is only to destroy transportation and disrupt local order, while the purpose of the current mobile warfare is strictly to capture large strongholds. Therefore, in addition to "mobile warfare," it is inevitable to fight positional battles. From the capture of Luoyang in March of this year to the temporary entry into Kaifeng in June, it can be said that it was the golden age for the communists to adopt a mobile strategy. On the National Army's side, on the one hand, because the guards were responsible for their duties, no stronghold could be easily abandoned. On the other hand, because the initial command was not unified, the National Army clearly lacked a kind of mobility in combat, and was thus placed in a somewhat passive position. The successive fall of the famous cities of Luoyang and Kaifeng in the Central Plains into the hands of the bandits cannot but be said to be the result of strategic errors on the part of the National Army.

Although the previous temporary fall of Kaifeng once formed a crisis in the Central Plains and caused a public outcry, it also gave the National Army a painful lesson. Later, the rapid recovery of Kaifeng, the formation of the encirclement in the Yellow River flood area, and the great victory of this annihilation war are indeed a major gain from the military authorities' "teaching war with shame" and changing their strategy. Observing the course of this Central Plains campaign, it is not difficult to point out the reasons for this great victory of the National Army: (1) The full play of the National Army's mobility, not only able to seize the opportunity to capture the main force of the bandit army, but also to march quickly and immediately form an encirclement of the main force of the bandit army, so that the bandit army's "遝动战" strategy could not be used; (2) The close cooperation between the land and air forces of the National Army made it impossible for the bandit army to escape the fate of being annihilated.

Kaifeng fell into the hands of the bandits on June 22. Because the gain or loss of this famous city in the Central Plains is not only related to the safety of Henan Province, but also sufficient to affect the entire war situation, the National Army rushed to aid in three routes, one from Lanfeng to the west, one from Zhengzhou to the east, and one from 对氏 to the north, and met in Biancheng on the 25th. 印兵团 entered Kaifeng City first on the 26th, and this important town in the Central Plains was recovered. At that time, after the bandit army fled southeast into the Yellow River flood area, one was due to the "underestimation of the enemy" mentality of the district bandits, and the other was due to its past strategy of "avoiding the real and attacking the empty," and still concentrated its main force between Qi and Sui,妄图 using a positional warfare strategy to一　, and the other was due to the geographical situation of the Central Plains. In the Yellow River flood area of a large plain, it was impossible to flee elsewhere without being pursued by our air force, so the bandit army had to concentrate its main force and fight a decisive battle with the main force of the National Army,拼一个 "you die or I live" decisive battle. The battle opened its bloody curtain on June 28. The National Army captured Qixian on the morning of the 29th, annihilated more than 1,000 bandit troops, and forced Chen's main force to gather in Suixian. This was the first test of the National Army's edge in this campaign, and also the prelude to the great victory of this annihilation war. From then on, the two sides engaged in a life-and-death struggle in the encirclement and counter-encirclement positions in the area of the three counties of Qi, Sui, and Tongxu. Our powerful air force also cooperated with the army at any time, in order to annihilate the main force of Chen Yi, Chen Geng, and Liu Bocheng in the Yellow River flood area. Our Supreme Commander also flew to the battlefield in the Yellow River flood area on the 2nd of this month, and the morale of the National Army was even more invigorated. On the morning of the 2nd, the National Army had won the first round of victory, shattering the enemy's attempt to "eat small with big." Moreover, when the western advance corps fought the bandits in the Diqiudian area east of Suixian, the eastern advance corps had also captured Hanzhai west of Suixian, thus completing the encirclement. The National Army used three divisions as the core position, used internal operations to attract the bandit army, while the Qiu, Hu, and Sun corps were on the outer line, making a large encirclement of the bandit army, making the bandit army a "ham" in a "sandwich." The fate of most of them being annihilated has been decided in the headquarters of our commander. The frequent good news the day before yesterday was already within our expectations, and we can assert that there will be even more pleasing and surprising news in the coming days.

From the above, it can be seen that the victory in the great battle in the Yellow River flood area, in addition to relying on the loyal and brave soldiers of our army to give their lives, the coordinated operations of the air force are also one of the decisive factors in achieving this annihilation war. Although we do not completely believe in "air force decisive victory," in order to deal with the communists' elusive "mobile warfare" and seek a way to control it, it is necessary for the air force to cooperate with the army. Recently, some people in society have attempted to 一　　a kind of "anti-bombing movement," which seems to be for humanitarianism on the surface, but in reality, it is nothing more than providing excuses for the shortcomings of the communists, helping the communists find a 一　口, using the big hat of "humanitarianism" to restrict the activities of our air force, forcing our National Army to passively take beatings! It must be known that if they are sincerely talking about humanitarianism, they should strongly advise the communists to turn over a new leaf, lay down their weapons, and become reformed citizens, no longer engaging in treasonous activities. Then the flames of war can be dissipated, and why bother the National Army to carry out a large-scale suppression? Is it only the communists' killing, arson, and seizing of cities and lands that are in line with humanitarianism, while the National Army's land and air coordination,痛扫 rebellious bandits, restoring order, and stabilizing people's hearts, is contrary to humanitarianism? We must not only be deceived by these strange arguments with ulterior motives, but also praise the power of the air force for making contributions to the country.

In short, this victory in the Yellow River flood area is indeed a major turning point in our country's anti-bandit military operations. From encirclement to annihilation, there is nothing that cannot be a model for our country's anti-bandit operations. From now on, troops across the country will change their strategies, invigorate their morale, give full play to the army's mobility, capture the main force of the bandit army, annihilate them in one fell swoop, and reveal to the whole country that the goal of our country's anti-bandit military operations in the future is not the gain or loss of a city or a place, but the number of bandits annihilated. Only in this way, we cannot be too optimistic about the frequent good news coming from the Yellow River flood area. Now the remnants of the bandit army are fleeing in three directions: northeast, southeast, and northwest, and the two large groups fleeing to western Shandong and northern Anhui have the妄图妄图徐州进窥, so a great battle in Xuzhou seems to be brewing again. Our land and air forces should take advantage of the victory and pursue them, so that the escaped bandits cannot succeed elsewhere. Here, with great enthusiasm, we look forward to another great victory in the Battle of Xuzhou!

### Dong XianGuang Answers Reporters' Questions - The Situation of Relief and Rehabilitation in Kaifeng - 400 Billion (currency) in Relief Funds Have Been Distributed to Victims

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Director Dong XianGuang, in response to reporters' questions at a press conference today regarding what rehabilitation measures the government has taken after recovering Kaifeng, said: Minister of Social Affairs, Gu ZhengGang, went to Kaifeng to supervise relief matters and has already returned to Nanjing after completing his duties. According to reports: The first step the government took after recovering Kaifeng was to investigate the losses suffered by Kaifeng residents and the number of casualties. According to population statistics, before Kaifeng fell, there were approximately 42,000 households. After the city's liberation, investigation forms of the same number were distributed to each household head. With the assistance of the Municipal Council, various schools, and public and private organizations, the investigation work was carried out, and more than 40,000 investigation forms were filled out. Based on this investigation, the losses and casualties of the people of Kaifeng are as follows: (1) Statistics on damaged houses in Kaifeng: (甲) A total of 20,282 civilian houses, 8,237 burned down, 4,959 bombed, and 7,086 damaged. (乙) A total of 2,930 schools, 1,015 burned down, 1,027 bombed, and 878 damaged. (丙) A total of 2,455 government agencies, 1,076 burned down, 414 bombed, and 965 damaged. (丁) A total of 25,667 buildings, 10,328 burned down, 6,410 bombed, and 8,929 damaged. (4) Statistics on casualties in Kaifeng: (甲) 432 deaths among the transient population, 564 injured, 185 seriously, and 379 lightly. (乙) 1,078 resident deaths, 1,557 injured, 520 seriously, and 1,037 lightly. (丙) 19 public servant deaths, 41 injured, 8 seriously, and 33 lightly. (丁) 36 student deaths, 75 injured, 21 seriously, and 54 lightly. (戊) 22 public and educational personnel deaths, 42 injured, 10 seriously, and 32 lightly. A total of 1,587 deaths, 2,279 injured, 744 seriously, and 1,535 lightly. Minister Gu continued, "Among the 36 student deaths, 3 belonged to National Henan University. Their deaths were not due to bombing but to other reasons. The damage to the National Henan University buildings was very minimal. The claim in the news that the air force indiscriminately bombed is absolutely inaccurate." According to Minister Gu, the air force's bombing and strafing targets were only the communist bandits' positions. Stray bullets and shrapnel may have injured innocent people, but it was definitely not intentional.

After the government investigated the casualties and losses of the people of Kaifeng, it immediately took various emergency relief measures, dispatched a relief service team to Kaifeng, and has repeatedly allocated and brought relief funds to the area for distribution. To date, nearly 400 billion (currency unit) in relief funds have been distributed, including 50 billion (currency unit) brought by Minister Gu, 30 billion (currency unit) brought by the Ministry of Social Affairs service team, 10 billion (currency unit) transferred by the Zhengzhou Central Bank at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs, 200 billion (currency unit) allocated by the Executive Yuan, 80 billion (currency unit) specially allocated by the President to the Henan Provincial Government and Kaifeng Municipal Government employees, 7 billion (currency unit) in special relief funds for National Henan University, and 15 billion (currency unit) for relief to refugees and students from Henan who came to Nanjing. The Central Government will also allocate special funds to provide relief to the employees of the Longhai Railway and other central agencies stationed in Kaifeng.

To date, the Central Government has separately distributed 10 million (currency unit) in relief funds to the families of those who died or were seriously injured in the war, 5 million (currency unit) to those who were slightly injured, 10 million (currency unit) each to those whose houses were destroyed by the bandit army, 3 million (currency unit) each to other poor refugees, 10 million (currency unit) each to public and educational personnel, and 3 million (currency unit) each to students.

Recently, the Ministry of Social Affairs has established a temporary office in Kaifeng, in conjunction with the Henan Provincial Government, to oversee the relief work.

### Six-Nation Agreement on the West German Question - Britain and the United States Express Disappointment, Poland Protests - The Chaotic and Unstable Situation in Germany is Due to the Soviet Union - Polish Interests Have Not Been Considered and a Complaint Should Be Filed with the Soviet Union

[Reuters, London, 7th] Poland lodged a note with Britain and the United States on June 18, protesting the resolutions of the London Six-Nation Conference. Britain and the United States individually responded to Poland today, rejecting Poland's protest, and stating that the actions taken by the Western countries were forced upon them due to the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate, therefore Poland's protest should be lodged with the Soviet Union.

British Government's Reply:  Declares that Britain's dissatisfaction with the failure of the Four Powers to reach an agreement on Germany is no less than Poland's. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France have repeatedly attempted to reach an agreement, and the Polish government supports the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany, so it is difficult to understand the basis for Poland's protest. The failure of the Western Allies' efforts to reach a Four Power agreement is due to the Soviet Union's repeated obstruction. The United Kingdom and Poland had signed a mutual assistance pact in 1939. Although the Soviet Union had signed a non-aggression treaty with Germany, facilitating Germany's actions, the United Kingdom was still the first country to declare war on Germany to help Poland, and the United Kingdom has always fully recognized Poland's interests. The assertion that the Western powers' agreement on the Ruhr will facilitate German aggression is also inaccurate. The United Kingdom has taken every possible measure to prevent German re-aggression, and the agreement on the Ruhr can ensure that Germany does not misuse its economic power for aggression. The London Conference did not discuss the issue of reparations. Poland can be assured that Britain will recognize its responsibility in this matter. The provisions on the future political organization of West Germany in the London Conference are based on a federal system, which is most suitable for the belief that Germany should be democratized. The regrettable situation in Europe today is directly the responsibility of the Soviet Union.  Since the Polish government supports the Soviet Union's attitude, inviting Poland to exchange views with the British government on matters related to Germany, is not only useless in the current environment, but will also put the Polish government's relationship with the Soviet Union in an embarrassing position. The British government is determined not to divide Germany or revive a strong Germany. The Polish government has no need to fear this. However, the British government must take the necessary actions to deal with the current situation, and the formation of this situation is not the responsibility of the United Kingdom.

Contents of the US Note:  US Undersecretary of State Lovett delivered a note to the Polish Ambassador to the United States in Washington today. The note also instructed the Polish government to lodge its complaints about the resolutions of the London Conference with the Soviet government. It also said that if countries most severely invaded by Germany believe that their interests have not been considered in the London Conference plan, they should not protest to the United States but to the country that prevented them from cooperating with the European Recovery Program. As for protesting the failure to fully utilize the Four Power Consultative Body, it should also be directed to the occupying powers that created the current situation in Germany and Europe. In the past three years, the Four Powers have held consultations on the German issue without success. The Soviet Union has vetoed resolutions agreed to by the other three powers a total of 69 times. Poland's claim that the United States is attempting to divide Germany is unfounded.  The fact that the European Recovery Program proposed by the United States was not accepted by certain countries, naturally prevents the recovery program from benefiting those countries. The US government is also very displeased with the current state of division in Germany. The Western countries' formulation of a joint plan for West Germany was not their original intention. The US note also denies the point that the London Conference did not fully consider the issue of security, and points out that the London Conference's proposals on the Ruhr and general security have specifically stipulated guarantees to prevent Germany from rebuilding its economic power for future aggression.

### East and West Launch Diplomatic War - Berlin Airlift Reaches Peak - Marshal Sokolovsky to Return Home with Bulganin

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 8th Broadcast: Regarding the British, American, and French memorandum to the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue, although its content has not been released, according to reliable sources, the three countries demanded that the Soviet Union immediately restore transportation to Berlin, and declared that they have absolutely no intention of withdrawing from Berlin.

[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Foreign Office stated that the full text of the protest note sent by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to the Soviet Union, which was originally scheduled to be released today, has now been postponed. The Foreign Office spokesperson did not explain the reason for this change of plan.

[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] People close to the Soviet military government said that Marshal Sokolovsky has been summoned and will return to Moscow in a day or two to meet with Molotov to discuss the situation caused by the Western Three Powers' note to the Soviet Union demanding the lifting of the Berlin blockade. Soviet Defense Minister Bulganin, who arrived in Berlin a few days ago to investigate the mission, will return home on the same plane as Marshal Sokolovsky. The same sources also believe that the Western Three Powers' note has very little chance of resolving the Berlin crisis.

[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] Amidst the increasingly tense diplomatic war between East and West, the Berlin airlift reached its peak on the 7th. Aircraft from the United States, Britain, and France transported 2,000 tons of supplies to Berlin, including food, coal, medicine, and other important supplies. American C-54 Skymaster aircraft have transported the first batch of 200 tons of airborne coal to the western sector of Berlin. Britain and the United States are also planning to use bombers converted into transport aircraft to drop large quantities of coal from bomb bay doors onto the grounds of the 1936 Olympic Games stadium. It is estimated that if 200 aircraft can be dispatched daily, it will be possible to maintain the power supply after the rationing is reduced. On the diplomatic front, since the United Kingdom, the United States, and France directly protested to Moscow demanding the lifting of the blockade of Berlin, Berlin is anxiously awaiting the Soviet Union's response. The Soviet Union has also lodged three protests with the Western Allies in the past 24 hours. One is to protest the United States' unilateral change of Berlin's air traffic rules, one is to protest the Western occupying authorities' obstruction of trade between the West and East Germany, and one is to protest the landing of British Sunderland flying boats carrying grain in Lake Havel in the American sector of Berlin. When the Soviet authorities protested to the United States about its unilateral change of air traffic rules, they issued a warning, claiming that if the air traffic rules agreed upon by the Four Powers are not adhered to, the safety of air traffic through the air corridors between West Germany and Berlin will no longer be guaranteed by the Soviet Union.

On the 8th, according to the Soviet-affiliated German News Agency, the Soviet military authorities have agreed to supply electricity to maintain the elevated railway.

### Italian-Style Strike Expands: 700,000 Metalworkers Join Strike

[United Press, Rome, 8th] Approximately 700,000 metalworkers went on strike this afternoon to support the demand for wage increases for Italian workers. This is the latest strike in a series of planned actions by the Communist-controlled General Confederation of Labor. Previously, police used tear gas to suppress labor unrest in Milan. Workers in the glass, ceramics, and saccharin industries are scheduled to strike tomorrow.

### Representatives from the United States, Canada, and Five Western European Nations Continue Discussions in Washington Aiming to Forge a Common Front Against the Soviet Union

[Special Dispatch] New York, 8th (Broadcast): A spokesman for the U.S. State Department stated that representatives from the five European countries participating in the Brussels Treaty and Canada met again today with U.S. Under Secretary of State Lovett to discuss the implementation of the Vandenberg Resolution. These negotiations have been ongoing for three consecutive days. Influential political circles in the United States believe that the U.S. is assuming the leadership of the Western nations' defense alliance too quickly.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] According to well-informed sources, the United States, Canada, and the five parties to the Brussels Pact will continue discussions here for three months, potentially resulting in a "Western European Union" and a political and military alliance in the North Atlantic region. Ostensibly for mutual cooperation, the overarching motivation of the seven nations in the talks is to formulate a common front to address general communism, particularly the Soviet Union. It is understood that the original plan, based on Vandenberg's proposal, included only the five countries of the Western European Union. However, Canada's sudden participation in the talks has expanded the overall scope of U.S. military support and mutual assistance to the North Atlantic region, including Canada's northern borders. The Combined Chiefs of Staff, a wartime organization, is still quietly working here, with military experts from both countries continuing to exchange information about their respective military capabilities. The U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board, another wartime organization, is also continuing its work as an integral part of the North American system.

### Britain Advocates Easing Restrictions on Trade between the Sterling Area and Japan: Representatives from Various Countries Are Consulting with the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers on Solutions

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Representatives from countries within the sterling area will consult with officials of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) tomorrow to discuss ways to maximize the level of trade between the sterling area and Japan "without relying on U.S. dollars." Thomas, the financial advisor to the British delegation, told reporters that the two sides will exchange views on the goods they can sell to each other in order to determine the trade trends between the sterling area and Japan for the next twelve months. Thomas pointed out that the Sterling-Based Payments Agreement concluded between SCAP and the sterling area on May 31 is the only way for trade between the sterling area and Japan after the war. He also said that there are still various restrictions that need to be eliminated in order to allow free flow of trade between the two regions. Thomas continued that now is a good time for SCAP and the sterling area to decide what kind of goods they need from each other, especially considering the traditional fact that most of Japan's foreign trade is within the sterling area. Currently, the sterling area mainly needs to purchase cotton textiles from Japan, while Japan wants to purchase raw materials such as cotton, wool, rubber, and minerals from the sterling area.

### City Buses Completely Shut Down: Labor Dispute Comes to an End, Bureau Chief Persuades Until 3 AM: Reinstatement to Be Discussed After All Workers Sign Agreement

[Special Dispatch] After the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's Public Transportation Company announced the unpaid leave of 197 drivers and conductors the day before yesterday, the laid-off workers petitioned the Social Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau. Bus lines such as Route 10, Route 9, and Route 3 were once suspended. In the evening, the laid-off workers stayed overnight at the company's workers' welfare association on Gongping Road. At around 4 a.m. yesterday, some workers climbed over the wall into the business office's dispatch room and removed all the copper plaques used by the company to dispatch workers daily, in order to prevent other workers from going to work. At that time, older workers had been arriving at the factory one after another, preparing to go to work, and the number of people gathered became increasingly large. At around 6 a.m., most of the company's 1,500-plus workers had arrived at the factory. Expressing sympathy and indignation for the 18th batch of conductors and the 21st batch of drivers who were placed on unpaid leave, they shouted slogans such as "We want to eat" and "We want to work" in unison, and rushed into the cooperative to grab bread, causing great chaos. The security authorities received the news and dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene to maintain order at the bus depot. The situation deteriorated and became increasingly serious. Although some workers were willing to go to work and drive, it was almost impossible. As a result, all bus lines under the company were completely shut down yesterday.

Petitioning the Mayor

At around 10 a.m. yesterday, more than 1,500 drivers, conductors, and other field personnel from the company boarded 21 buses and drove to the City Hall to petition. Traffic was congested along Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road. After arriving at the City Hall, the workers wrote slogans in chalk on the road and walls protesting the "unpaid leave" and lined up to demand an audience with the mayor. Initially, Chief of the Public Relations Section Zhang Bide came out to persuade them and asked them to elect representatives for negotiation. The workers were reluctant to elect representatives because representatives had been dismissed by the company after negotiating with the company authorities last time. Eventually, two messengers were selected, Su Naiding, No. 1050, and Cheng Limin, No. 1055. At around 11 a.m., Mayor Wu and Public Utilities Bureau Chief Zhao received them. Mayor Wu was furious that the workers' gathering to petition was obstructing traffic in the central district. He ordered the two messengers to persuade all the workers to leave the City Hall before 12 p.m. and elect ten representatives to negotiate with the company authorities. The messengers conveyed Mayor Wu's intentions to the crowd, who protested loudly, arguing that they were only asking for food and had not taken any illegal actions. Moreover, because the workers had no labor union organization, no one was willing to serve as a representative on a temporary basis. Therefore, they collectively elected Wang Zongshan, the head of the Transportation Section, and Ding Weitang, the deputy head, as representatives. Wang and Ding refused because of their status as employees, resulting in a stalemate in the petitioning procession. At this time, the Police Bureau dispatched red riot control vehicles and flying fortresses to the scene to maintain order. Police Bureau Chief Yu also rushed to the City Hall to suppress the situation at 12 p.m. By 1 p.m., there were still no results. All the petitioning workers then withdrew from the City Hall and returned to the welfare association on Gongping Road.

Mayor Telephones Company: Severance Pay Increased to Two Months

At 3 p.m., after repeated urging from various parties, the workers finally elected six representatives, including five conductors (Nos. 1050, 1065, 1158, 1142, and 1113) and one driver (No. 1055), to begin negotiations with Ding Weitang, the deputy head of the Transportation Section, and Xuan Qiangong and Chen Kejia, the section chiefs. The workers' representatives put forward two demands: (1) The company should withdraw the dismissal order; (2) Employment security should be provided after reinstatement. The company agreed to increase the severance pay to one month, guaranteed by Deputy Head Ding, but the workers' representatives stated that they could not accept this. At 8:30 p.m., Mayor Wu telegraphed the company authorities, ordering them not to withdraw the dismissal order, to increase the severance pay to two months, and to have the remaining workers return to work today, or they would be considered as having voluntarily resigned and would be dealt with severely according to law.

Workers Still Request Withdrawal of Order

After receiving the telegram, Zhang Mingtao, the director of preparations for the Transportation Company, and Ding Weitang, the deputy head of the Transportation Section, immediately went to the welfare association to announce Mayor Wu's solution. The workers still stated that they could not accept it and proposed a solution: the company should allow the new workers to continue working, and all the old workers (referring to conductors before the 18th batch and drivers before the 21st batch) are willing to forgo two days of work each month to subsidize the new workers, so that the company can still achieve the purpose of saving expenses. They asked Zhang and Ding to sign and accept this on the spot. Director Zhang said that the order for unpaid leave could not be changed, but the workers insisted on asking for the withdrawal of the order and did not allow Zhang and Ding to leave the welfare association.

Insistently Invite Bureau Chief Inside for Instruction

At 10 p.m., the eastern area entered a state of temporary alert. The police station of the Tilanqiao Police Precinct, the Police Headquarters, and the Garrison Command dispatched more than a thousand police officers, and dispatched fire trucks and red riot control vehicles to the scene to be on guard. Zhao, the chief of the Public Utilities Bureau, Deputy Chief Zhang, Specialist Song Yunhui, and Yu, the chief of the Police Bureau, also arrived at the company one after another to personally mediate. Initially, the workers said that among the six representatives they had elected, driver No. 1055, conductors Nos. 1050, 1065, and 1158, and three old workers who had gone out to inquire about messages, conductors Nos. 847, 957, and 682, were all missing. Later, Wang Zongshan, the head of the group, found the seven people and sent them to the welfare association, and everyone was speechless. Chief Zhao immediately wrote a personal note and sent it to Director Zhang, Deputy Head Ding, and Group Head Wang, who were trapped inside: "I hope you will immediately accompany the 18th batch of conductors and the 21st batch of drivers to gather in front of the Inspection Section to listen to instructions." However, the workers still refused to leave the welfare association, and also did not allow Zhang and Ding to go outside, but insisted on inviting Chief Zhao into the welfare association to give instructions. The stalemate could not be broken, and the situation became more and more serious.

At 1:40 a.m. this morning, Chief Zhao decided to personally come to the entrance of the welfare group and planned to use a loudspeaker to instruct all the workers. However, everyone refused to listen and retreated into the welfare group's auditorium. Chief Zhao, accompanied by Chief Yu of the Police Bureau and others, entered the auditorium and announced to everyone: (1) Each of the 18th batch of conductors and the 21st batch of drivers will receive two months' salary and bonuses up to the 7th. Those who wish to return home can receive it today. They are expected to find jobs within two months. When the company's situation improves, they may be allowed to return to work. (2) You are all acting impulsively, destroying objects, and kidnapping the company's negotiators, regardless of the consequences. This is a violation of discipline. You must know that it is okay not to work in the future, but it is absolutely unacceptable not to behave like human beings. (3) The company's transportation lines are urgently needed by the public. You are making it difficult for the public by demanding shutdowns. The reputation that the company has painstakingly built with the citizens in the past three years should not be destroyed by you with one hand. Chief Zhao then painfully stated that he had trained tens of thousands of telecommunications technicians in Zhejiang for ten years, all of whom were able to serve the country, but in the three years he had trained a large number of transportation talents in Shanghai, it had caused today's incident, which he deeply regretted. Finally, he ordered the people on the scene to raise their hands and count the numbers separately. There were only 40 drivers left in the 21st batch, and only 50 conductors left in the 18th batch. Chief Zhao declared that he would keep his promise and asked them to return to Gaochang Temple or their homes to rest as soon as possible. At this time, conductor No. 1161, Shen Hanshi, suddenly stepped forward to the stage and shook hands with Chief Zhao, crying bitterly and telling about his life. He said that his pain was beyond the authorities' estimation. What is the use of a meager two months' salary? Moreover, it is not easy to find a job. How will his family live in Shanghai? After Chief Zhao's investigation, it was found that Shen had not slept or eaten for two days and was afraid of losing his job. Last night at 9 p.m., he jumped off the welfare association building in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, the building was not very high, and he was temporarily unconscious. He was fortunate to recover later. He was ordered to be dealt with separately, but everyone was still restless. It was not until about 3 a.m. that Chief Zhao, considering the urgent need to resume work today, was willing to make concessions and instructed all the old colleagues to sign their names and submit them to the company authorities within four days. The company could consider giving them two days of work each month to subsidize the conductors and drivers of the 18th and 21st batches to be reinstated. Thus, the dispute that had been delayed for two days finally came to an end. The workers left one after another, and Chief Zhao and others returned to their residences.

### How Expensive Are Nylon Stockings: Old Ones Sell for 20 Million Each

The import and sale of nylon stockings have been banned, and the Municipal Council has passed a resolution to stop the sale of all nylon stockings that have not been sold out before August 1st on the following day. After the news spread, things became scarce and expensive, which made the "high-ranking citizens" very interested in this. They believe that they will not be able to obtain them in the future, and have been rushing to buy them in recent days. Therefore, the market price has soared, and each pair is sold for 20 million yuan.

### Maintaining Food Supply for the Poor: Subsidized Rice Sales to Be Held Next Month

[Special Dispatch] Recently, rice prices have soared, and the distribution price of household rice has also increased accordingly. Therefore, most poor people cannot afford to buy household rice. The Civil Food Allocation Committee and the Social Bureau, in view of this, plan to start distributing rice to the poor and holding subsidized rice sales next month. The Baojia chiefs are responsible for conducting detailed investigations into the lives of the poor, limited to those who cannot maintain their livelihood and need relief. Each person is allowed to purchase one dou per month. The price will be publicly announced by the municipal government each month, possibly similar to the rice distribution price for journalists and elementary school teachers. Another consultation will be held today.

### Department Stores' Pay Raise: Difficult to Decide

Another consultation will be held today.

[Special Dispatch] The employees of ten major department stores in the city, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Great World, and China National Products, have demanded an increase in base salary, and a dispute has arisen with the employers. Since the Social Bureau's mediation, the employers have agreed in principle to the employees' demands, but both labor and management have asked the Social Bureau to decide how much to increase. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Director Wu, who said that because the business conditions of each company are different, for example, the daily income of Wing On Company is equivalent to the five-day income of China National Products Company, it is very difficult to decide on a uniform number. Labor and management will be invited again today to discuss a suitable solution.

If the registration is delayed, it will be treated as a private warehouse upon discovery, and all the goods stored in it, whether they are daily necessities or other goods, will be confiscated and confiscated, and citizens will be rewarded for reporting at any time.

### Shipping Rates to Be Adjusted Again: Average Increase of 110 Percent

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon to discuss adjusting shipping rates. The result was that since the shipping rates were adjusted on July 1, the various expenses of the shipping industry have increased by an average of 118 percent. For cost considerations, it was decided that passenger and freight transportation should be adjusted by 110 percent uniformly, otherwise it would be difficult to maintain. The transshipment fee for Shanghai-Hankou goods will be increased to 5.2 million yuan per ton, and the transshipment fee for Hankou-Yichang will be increased to 4 million yuan. The surcharge for heavy goods will be increased by 110 percent.

The implementation date of the shipping rate increase will be around the 15th.

### Fired and Holding a Grudge: Arson Kills Five: Tragedy on Fuxing Middle Road, Perpetrator Surrenders After the Incident

[Special Dispatch] Lu Zimei, a Chaozhou native, 41 years old, had been working at the Qiaxing Pawnshop at No. 1 Fuxing Middle Road for more than 20 years. Recently, he was fired because the pawnshop's business was sluggish. Lu only received more than 9 million in severance pay and could not return home. He repeatedly asked the pawnshop owner, Xu Songjia, to increase it, but without success. Therefore, he harbored resentment and hatred. At 5 a.m. yesterday, he got up from his bed and ignited two boxes of kerosene next to him with oiled paper, setting a fire. Suddenly, flames soared. Lu, seeing that he had caused a great disaster, had a moment of conscience and shouted "Fire!" from the back door. The local fire brigade arrived at the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished after an hour. However, the six members of the family of Gao Jianqing, the assistant manager of the pawnshop, who were sleeping upstairs, were only able to save Gao Zihou. The rest were buried in the fire. Afterwards, Lu, realizing that he could not escape the law, rushed to the Bund on Zhongzheng East Road to commit suicide by jumping into the river. He suddenly changed his mind, thinking of his elderly parents and young children, and did not want to die immediately. So he turned around and surrendered to the Songshan Police Precinct, admitting his guilt. He confessed to the arson process without denying anything. The case is currently being handled by the precinct.

### Kaifeng Experiences a Sudden Windstorm and Rain; Coming Quickly and Going Quickly; Liu Maoen Says: We Must Strive for Survival in the Ruins

[Dispatch from Kaifeng, One Day Ago] After the bandits invaded Kaifeng, the streets were filled with slogans and leaflets, full of words like "Liberate Kaifeng." What exactly did it "liberate?" Here is a brief account:

(1) Thoroughly destroyed the machinery of the Pulin Power Plant and the Fuyu Flour Mill, and plundered countless books, instruments, and specimens from the Provincial Library, Museum, and Henan University.

(2) On the 18th, over 300 officers and soldiers of the Security Regiment were collectively executed in Hanjia Camp in the southern suburbs of the city.

And one of the most alarming things is: the massacre of 5,000 brave soldiers of the National Army.

The fact is this: After the bandits captured Kaifeng, on the evening of the 22nd, they formed over 5,000 captured officers and soldiers into a team and escorted them to the Yellow River crossing in the northwest of Kaifeng. First, they told the captured people to rest and drink water. When everyone squatted on the Yellow River beach, dozens of pre-arranged heavy machine guns opened fire, ending the lives of my 5,000 brave soldiers and venting their bestial desires. The Communist bandits were very cunning. They hid on the Yellow River beach to carry out the collective massacre, but they did not expect that a platoon leader named Huang Zheng from the artillery battalion of the 66th Division, who survived by chance, escaped and announced this inhuman fact. When Commander Qiu Qingquan told me this fact, he was extremely delighted. He said: I am happier to receive this news than to hear that my troops have annihilated 100,000 enemies. Based on this point, I can be sure that the Communist bandits are not difficult to eliminate! It is said that after the shooting, the Communist bandits threw the bodies of more than 5,000 people into the Yellow River, which may be the so-called "covering up the corpses," but will the hatred of the people also disappear with the rolling waters of the Yellow River?

When Kaifeng was in danger, the East, West, and South route reinforcements, including Guo's brigade advancing east from Zhengzhou, were intercepted by Chen Geng's 9th Column in Zhongmu. Hu Lian's corps, advancing north from southern Henan, was blocked by Liu Bocheng's troops north of Shangcai. Qiu Qingquan's corps, the most powerful and promising, marched west from near Jinxiang, western Shandong, on the 18th, a long distance of 500 li, a long journey of seven or eight days. The "Fire Bull Army," which had fought in the area of Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui for two years, repeatedly defeated the blocking attempts of Chen's 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns, and finally captured Kaifeng on the 26th.

On the 25th, in the headquarters of Qiu's corps, I heard that Chairman Liu Maoen had escaped danger and was residing in the headquarters of the 83rd Division. So I visited him with Deputy Division Commander Xiao San of the 5th Reorganized Division. The next day, at 4:00 PM, Kaifeng was recovered. I followed Chairman Liu and Zhou Liefan, the Director of the Provincial News Office, and President Wang of the Henan Provincial Business School, who had escaped danger and coincidentally met the Chairman, into Kaifeng at 7:50 PM.

The ancient city in the setting sun, sand and dust filled the sky, the four suburbs of the city, new graves piled up, three or four hungry dogs, tottering and limping, the atmosphere was tragic and solemn, this is war!

Our car, under the step-by-step exploration of the mine sweeper, drove into Bian City. Chairman Liu Maoen stood on the jeep with the roof open, waving to the citizens. Thousands of people could not help but clap and cheer, welcoming Chairman Liu, who entered Bianyuan only four hours after the recovery.

The setting sun shrouded the destroyed Xiangguo Temple, the Post Office Building, the Provincial Government Building, the Women's Normal School, Zhongqi, the Pulin Power Plant, ... dangerous walls standing tall, tiles piled up, looking at these ruined walls, Chairman Liu sighed repeatedly to the reporter.

In the rubble piles of the Provincial Government and the Post Office Building, there were still several places smoking, and the streets were filled with the smell of burning, sometimes faint and sometimes strong. This smell stimulated people's hearts. At this time and place, everyone would think: when can the devastation be restored?

The power plant was burned down, the power lines were destroyed, and the telephone poles beside the street were lying on the ground, east and west. There were no lights, and only the lights on the military vehicles were shining on the dark road. Please do not neglect this faint light, it is precisely a glimmer of hope that the 500,000 people of Kaifeng have been hoping for for four days!

On the night of Chairman Liu's return to Bian, he and several key officials of the Provincial Government who had escaped danger, such as Secretary-General Ma Lingfu, Director of Education Wang Gongdu, Director of the News Office Zhou Liefan, and General Manager Yang Xiansheng of the Provincial Bank, planned measures to appease the people and restore order. The next day, the Provincial Government's notice to appease the people was posted in the streets and alleys. A batch of police officers withdrawn from Luoyang, transported by Langzhou vehicles, arrived in Bianyuan and immediately began to work. A large army gathered in Kaifeng, and the generals were discussing plans to defend Bianyuan. The political workers of the 5th Army were handling the work of providing relief to the people and treating the people. The official propaganda vehicles were running non-stop on the major streets. The people spontaneously posted slogans: "Welcome Chairman Liu," "Welcome Commander Qiu," "Welcome the Fifth Army," ... Obviously, after suffering from the terror of the Reds, the people began to look forward to getting a little warmth in the embrace of the government.

The whereabouts of General Li Zhongxin, the Division Commander of the 66th Reorganized Division, was still a mystery on the morning of the 27th. Suicide? The body could not be found. Captured? In the Communist bandits' broadcasts, only Staff Officer You of the Division Headquarters and Brigade Commander Zhang of the 13th Brigade were mentioned, but his name was not mentioned. Breakout? It seemed impossible in fact. Even if possible, why has there been no news for three days? On the morning of the 27th, I drove to Longting, where General Li's headquarters was located. Longting was the former site of the imperial palace of the Northern Song Dynasty, and it was the last stronghold to fall in this battle. I endured the smell of corpses and walked around (it is better to say mourned). There were corpses with broken legs and arms, crouching beside bricks and tiles, or submerged in the pool of water. There were the shells of more than 20 cars that had been burned by the bandits. There were unusable cannons, unexploded grenades, artillery shells, and hats, shoes, and socks left by the soldiers.

I climbed up to a nearby bunker on the north city wall and met two officers. One was Tan Shiying, the adjutant of the 66th Division Commander, and the other was Platoon Leader Liu of the Division's Special Service Battalion. They were there to find General Li's remains. After talking, I unintentionally confirmed the news of General Li's suicide. According to them, on the evening of the 21st, the bandits broke into Beiguan, and the North and South routes concentrated their firepower and pounced on Longting. At this time, General Li had already suffered a serious leg injury in Longting, and the situation of Longzu was very dangerous. So Adjutant Tan carried Li from the right side of Longting to this bunker in the north of the city, at 8:10 PM. The general's bravery could not change the deterioration of the situation. Seeing the Communist bandits gradually approaching the bunker, General Li Zhongxin could not save the situation. In the traditional spirit of a revolutionary soldier, at 9:15 PM, he took a revolver pistol that he wore with him, pointed it at his right temple, and killed himself with one shot. Where the blood splashed, he wrote a clear and brilliant page in the history of the suppression of the rebellion!

Adjutant Tan was on the side at the time. Because he was assisting in the battle, he did not have time to cover up the remains. When he was wounded and captured, and then escaped to see it again, General Li's remains were gone. He only found a talisman and a belt that General Li had worn during his lifetime.

He pointed to a patch of blood on the ground and a pile of hair and said, "This is the last relic that General Li can give people." Saying that, he temporarily buried the blood-soaked soil and messy hair underground. I bowed my head and stared at the mound of yellow sand, wishing the general eternal rest!

Like a storm, it came quickly and went quickly. Kaifeng returned to peace from the storm. Shops opened, public institutions returned, and there were more pedestrians on the sidewalks... Chairman Liu Maoen had a long conversation with the reporter by candlelight on the night of the recovery of Kaifeng. He said: Relief is the first priority after the recovery. The provincial capital will never move elsewhere. We must strive for survival in the ruins. When I flew by military plane to Zheng on the afternoon of the 27th, I saw the bright national flag flying over the city of Bian in the sunlight, and realized that Kaifeng tomorrow will surely move towards a new life in hardship!

### Autumn of Storms, Unforgettable Friendship, Zhang Xueliang Thanks Song Ziwen and Zhang Zuoxiang for the Property of the Northeast

[Dispatch from Beiping, August 8th] After the victory, Zhang Xueliang, who was far away in Taiwan, repeatedly instructed his family not to pursue the property of the Northeast before the "September 18th" Incident, but his enthusiastic friends had organized a committee in Shenyang to clean up the property on his behalf. The people in charge are Song Ziwen and Zhang Zuoxiang. It is said that the cleanup has made considerable progress, and the committee sends periodic reports to him. He wrote to his friends saying: Thank you to Mr. Song Ziwen and Marshal Zhang (Zuoxiang) for taking the time to handle these trivial matters for him in the autumn of storms, which he will never forget in his life.

It is also learned that Zhang Xueliang, who just turned forty-seven this year, has become a grandfather of two grandsons. His four children all live in the United States with Yu Fengzhi. Yu currently lives near Hollywood. The eldest son, Lvxun, is unmarried due to illness. The second son, Lvyu, works for a company in the United States and is married with two grandsons.

### Map of the Flooded City of Fuzhou

— Tian Qing

[Fuzhou Dispatch] Every year, the people of Fuzhou worry about the arrival of the "Guan Di Knife Sharpening Water" on the thirteenth day of the fifth month (lunar calendar). On that day, the water always rises and floods the land. This time, however, the water began to rise two days earlier (June 17th) at 10 PM. By dawn on the 18th, the raging, muddy waves had taken over the entire city. Areas that had never flooded before were flooded this time. In the Taijiang district, Sanbao, Shangshu Temple, and Damao Street; in Yizhou, Hubuqian, and Wenzao Mountain; in the Cangshan district, Longjiao, Wanpu Mound, and Sheren Temple; in the Dagen district, Erqiao Pavilion, Jindou Bridge, and Nanmendou; and in the Gulou district, Hongshan Bridge Street – in these low-lying areas, the water level was over thirteen feet. In the areas of Yizhou and Shangshu Temple, the water level was even over twenty feet. Even in areas like Shengfu Road and Dongjiekou, there were raging waves of over three or four feet.

Overlooking the City from Nando Temple

In order to understand the water situation in the entire city, the reporter braved the rain and climbed to the Nando Temple on the top of Yu Mountain. Standing at the highest point of the mountain, I looked out over the entire city and the LinSen county boundary within sight. As the saying goes, "The higher the mountain, the smaller the world." When people's horizons expand, they can often feel refreshed and broad-minded. But under this unprecedented disaster, the wider my view, the heavier my heart became. From Yizhou and Hongshan Bridge in the far west, Sanxian Isle in the southwest, Shangdu Road in the far south, and Yazu Island and Kangshan in the far east, except for Ping Mountain in the far north, everything was submerged in the turbulent yellow water. Everywhere was a vast expanse of water, with muddy waves reaching the sky. I couldn't find a single complete house, only countless rooftops and treetops floating in the raging waves. They trembled, floated, and were in danger of being swallowed up at any moment. Looking beyond the Min River to Kuiqi Majiang, this desolate scene of a flooded land continued to extend.

Wading Through Waist-Deep Water to Ask About the Disaster

The reporter braved the waist-deep water to visit the disaster area. However, in this turbulent torrent, the distance one could travel by wading was indeed very limited. Although there were many boats and rafts coming and going on the street, most were chartered at high prices, either for leisure or for rescuing disaster victims. Those out for leisure naturally wouldn't allow "idlers" to wade, and those rescuing victims couldn't allow reporters to increase their load and reduce the chances of the disaster victims escaping.

In the places the reporter passed, countless refugees were waiting for the final rescue with desperate eyes. Most of them were huddled in attics, their hungry and terrified faces peeking out from the window cracks, hoping someone would offer them a spoonful of watery porridge to quench their hunger or a helping hand. But they were also afraid of rafts or boats approaching, constantly issuing almost ferocious warnings to those who came, because those houses that were already floating would be completely destroyed with the slightest wave-induced collision.

Those who could hide in the attic were already fortunate. Most people didn't have an attic to shelter in. In the middle of the night, the water suddenly rose. There was no way to escape. How could they avoid this unprecedented catastrophe when they had no experience in their lives? They could only temporarily find some door panels or the like to tie into rafts, allowing the whole family to float on the water, trembling and not daring to move for the whole day, and not daring to sleep for a moment throughout the long night.

More Than a Thousand Killed by Crushing and Drowning

In the city area, from Sunlaoying, Shanhua Fang, Cheng Bian Cao, Dazhong Temple, and Daming Road, almost no mud-walled house was complete. Everywhere was a scene of rubble. Most of the wooden houses were left with only a shell. Large sections of the provincial government's walls on the south and west sides collapsed, and parts of the Social Affairs Department, Finance Department, Education Department, and Civil Affairs Department also collapsed.

In Yijin Lane, nine out of ten houses collapsed. The outer walls of the Western-style house of Inspector Yang all collapsed. Numerous disaster victims whose houses had been flooded were desperately digging through the remains, moving whatever furniture and boxes were left. The situation in Wenru Lane was even worse. There were mostly big houses there, but the collapse of the big houses was even more severe. In the house of Gan Lianquan, the navy captain and descendant of Gan Guobao, the nine-door admiral of number 70, fifteen members of his family, including his nephew's wife and nieces, would have all perished if it hadn't been for the help of dozens of students from the neighborhood who rescued nine of them. But only three corpses were dug out of the three daughters, one son, and two children buried inside. In Guanglu Lane and Cangqian Street, ten out of ten houses collapsed. None were spared. There was only a difference in the degree of collapse. No one was spared. The situation on Chating Road was simply unbearable to look at. From number 141 to number 181, the wooden houses and the Nanshi Primary School, Chating Xima Dou Nan Fire Brigade, all had only empty shells, and everything was washed away. Electric poles lay scattered all over the ground, and several bridges had completely collapsed. The situation on Hujie Road was a complete mess. Antai Bridge, Jibi Lane, Guizhi Lane, Zhuzi Lane, Daoshan Road, Nanmendou, Zhongzhou, Shangdu, Longtan Corner, Yizhou, Shangshu Temple Hubu Qian, Wenzao Mountain... countless disaster areas, most of the fronts were still intact, but inside there was no place to stand. Although there were not many collapses on Xiahang Road, most of Fuzhou's treasures – sugar, fertilizer powder, and cement – were flooded. Other merchandise might still be able to retain some capital, but these were completely damaged. According to general estimates, tens of thousands of houses have collapsed, and at least a thousand people have been crushed and drowned. More than 200,000 people have been affected by the disaster, and the loss of property and materials may reach more than 40 to 50 trillion. How long will it take for Fuzhou, which is under this unprecedented disaster, to recover?

### Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday

Medium Indica Rice Almost Vanished from the Market

Yesterday, the food rice market transaction, due to the limited price of 20 million, upper and middle indica rice almost disappeared. Only the earliest second-class early rice was transacted at the limited price. Milled indica rice also reached 20 million, the market price of the upper white indica rice was 22.2 million, the middle one was 21.15 million, the high thin rice and the yang indica rice were uniformly priced at 22.2 million, and the early rice was 20.5 million, each of which was 1 million higher than the previous day. Yinyuan white and yuancheng middle grades were both transacted at 20 million. A total of 4,780 dan of goods arrived in the market from the north and south.

Flour: Yesterday, the manufacturer allocated various brands of flour for actual sales in this street. The price was 6.2 million, 29 bags per household, for a total of 7,560 bags, but the supply was still insufficient to meet the demand. On the one hand, the price of wheat was high, and the price of flour in other ports had increased, so people's hearts were firm and the price outside the market rose again. Lao Che was 7.2 million, and Bingchuan was 7 million, each rising by 500,000 to 600,000. Wheat bran rose by 150,000, and wheat was 5.5 million.

Miscellaneous Grains: The price increased across the board. Soybeans were scarce in both arrival and storage, and the cost was high, so they continued to rise by 1 million. Hankou Zha beans were transacted at 11.1 million, 1 million higher than the limited price. Mung beans were selling very well in this street, and high-quality goods were priced 1 million higher. Broad beans rose by 400,000 to 500,000. New and old corn were not connected, and the supply was short, so the price increased sharply. Qidong corn rose by 4 million, and red sorghum was priced very high. Mingguang red sorghum was 10.5 million, and sesame was increased by another 2 million. Raw peanuts saw stagnation in sales to the south and were uniquely 1 million lower.

Edible Oil: Due to the lack of raw materials and high soybean prices, the market situation increased. Various oil factories tried to supply soybean oil at a price of 45 million. Zhongzhi Factory and Dasheng Factory tried to open rapeseed oil at 43 million, which was as high as the limited price. Raw oil was also transacted at the limited price of 60 million, each rising by 1 million to 2 million. Xiao Che sesame oil rose by 2 million to close at 60.15 million. Soybean cake initially opened at 4.8 million, but later fell to 4.7 million due to less supply than demand, which was the same as yesterday.

### Tea Market Transactions Were Dull

Although the main sellers of red and green tea yesterday wanted to hoard goods, the transactions did not become active due to the reluctance of the street and rural buyers to offer prices for domestic sales of various types of tea. As for export tea, exporters are also organizing the goods that have been processed in the past few days to catch up with the shipping schedule of the ship sailing to the Philippines on the 18th of this month, so they have no intention of rushing to accept the goods. Therefore, the market situation is circuitous and slightly firm, and there is no major change compared to before.

### Sichuan Province Requests to Purchase Shaanxi Cotton

Sui Office Cables Shaanxi Provincial Government Requesting Issuance of Purchasing Certificates for Yusha Factory

[Chongqing Dispatch from this Newspaper on the 8th] The Sui Office cabled the Shaanxi Provincial Government on the 8th, requesting that purchasing certificates be issued to the Yusha Factory before the new cotton is put on the market to purchase 18,000 dan of Shaanxi cotton. A total of 9,000 dan in Shashi, 2,700 dan each for Shenxin and Yuhua, and 4,500 dan for Yufeng. Also, before receiving a reply from the Shaanxi Provincial Government, cotton stored in the Chongqing market and the China Textile Company cotton will be uniformly prohibited from entering Sichuan, and each factory will purchase it at market prices.

### Rubber Industry Association Requests Restriction on Imports of Rubber Products

The Rubber Products Industry Association of this city, in view of the fact that the authorities are too lenient in restricting the import of rubber products, 40% of the foreign exchange obtained by the rubber industry in the quarterly quota of the Import and Export Administration Commission is finished products, while the real rubber raw materials are only 60%. This phenomenon is not only a major blow to the development of the rubber industry, but also a major waste of the government's foreign exchange. In the past, it has repeatedly listed facts and requested the government to change the current policy, but there have been no concrete results. Recently, the industry has become increasingly aware that the foreign exchange reserves are dwindling, and the raw materials needed by various industries are in urgent need. Therefore, it has once again listed the advantages and disadvantages and submitted them to the Import and Export Administration Commission, requesting that, except for aircraft and small car tires that are not yet produced domestically, all other finished products should be prohibited from import from the sixth season's import quota. The foreign exchange used for the import of finished products in the past will be used to purchase raw materials to maintain the production of various factories and save foreign exchange expenditures.

### Silver Market Trended Towards Relaxation

Yesterday, the silver market in this city trended towards relaxation. The four banks and one bureau reported another difference in the clearing of bills, with a total difference of 709.7 billion.

The large clearing difference of commercial banks was 658.5 billion, the small clearing difference was 645 billion, and the total clearing difference of foreign banks was 696.2 billion.

### Credit Cooperative Checks are Not Allowed to Participate in Clearing

[Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Gold Control Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that the checks issued by various credit cooperatives are in conflict with the provisions of Article 123 of the Negotiable Instruments Law and should not be accepted. In addition to notifying the three industry associations of banking, money, and trust to comply with the order, the bureau also notified the bill clearing house yesterday that checks issued by credit cooperatives are not allowed to participate in clearing.

### People's Hearts are Scattered and Not Much is Opened; Fine Yarn Prices See Squeezing and Small; Many Cotton Cloth Sellers are Narrowly Rising and Falling

Yesterday, due to the authorities' cancellation of day-to-day transactions to avoid risks, brokers in the cotton yarn market successively withdrew, and the police in the market were still strictly monitoring, people's hearts were scattered, and activities were delayed until after 12 o'clock. As a result, various grades of popular yarns of 42 counts were rarely opened. Blue Phoenix closed at 980 million, falling back by 20 million. Only one grade of 40 counts, Blue Phoenix, was 950 million. 32 counts of Silver Moon were 915 million, squeezing small by 25 million. Day-to-day 21 counts of Shuangma came out with a squeeze of 10 million lower. Only a small number of 20 counts, such as Shuangdiqiu, Jincheng, and Tiannv Duobao House, were opened, and the market also fell. 16 counts of Benteng were transacted at 660 million, squeezing up 10 million. 16 counts and other coarse yarns were rarely opened. Only copy factories and guest groups slightly absorbed them throughout the day, with 39 orders, totaling 113 pieces.

In another dispatch: The China Textile Yarn Management Committee threw out 185 pieces of yarn yesterday and sold 23,870 pieces of cloth and 430 quilts. The two items of cloth and quilts alone recovered 597,896,000,000 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation: due to the emergency of checking warehouses, the inspection of the bills of various banks was also strict, the capital turnover in the industry was still tight, and it was the time for the sale of textiles and constructions, so all parties were selling more. Except for Sichuan and Hankou gangs in the market who slightly added to the original wool fabric, the northern gangs and the bank owners still had more supply than demand. As a result, 12-pound Longtou B-shaped fine cloth squeezed well by 300,000, and the Four Gentlemen original wool fabric also rose by 300,000. The market price of other cloths fluctuated narrowly.

In another dispatch: Textile Construction Company tendered 12-pound Wufu fine cloth, Four Gentlemen original wool fabric Poplin, Ruyi bleached cloth, Jumping Carp Electric Light Twill, etc., totaling 12 kinds, and one kind of 68×86 colored floral quilt. It is heard that the price filled out by cloth merchants applying for Wufu fine cloth is about 24 million to 420 million yuan, and the price filled out for Four Gentlemen original wool fabric is 26 million to 620 million yuan, with dye factories applying for the most.

[Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Yarn Management Committee recently considered that the quantity of Hankou raw cotton that can be purchased is still huge. At the same time, taking into account the flexibility of the capital turnover of Hankou cotton merchants who purchased a large amount of raw cotton, after the last committee meeting, it was resolved that, for a period of one month, each entrusted cotton purchasing merchant will be allowed to receive 80% of the loan from this association with the cotton transportation bill of lading. The association has yesterday telegraphed the Hankou Cotton Merchant Purchasing Cotton Joint Venture Office to inform them of this.

### Jiaotong University's Holiday Approaching; Half of Graduates' Paths Already Determined

[This Newspaper] Most public and private universities and colleges in the city have completed their exams and are about to begin their holidays. Jiaotong University is currently holding its final exams, which will conclude on the 13th, immediately followed by the holiday. Students who must stay on campus during the summer will still need to register as before. Zhou Ming, the university's dean of academic affairs, told reporters yesterday: He eagerly hopes that the new president, Li Zhaohuan, can arrive at the university as soon as possible to preside over school affairs.

### Our World Games Soccer Team; Wonderful Performance Before Departure; Defeats Singapore Team 4-3

[United News Agency, Singapore, 7th] The Chinese World Games soccer team made its last match here tonight before going to England, defeating the Singapore team 4-3. The Chinese team lost to the team 0-1 last month. This time to avenge the past humiliation, they put in extra effort. The first half of the game showed very high level of skill, but the second half was just average. After the kick-off, the five Chinese forwards rushed forward. Center forward Zhu Yongqiang and right inside forward Zou Wenzhi were particularly elusive. The new team's defense was not solid and difficult to resist. Chinese wingers He Yingfen and Li Dahui broke through the enemy's line and repeatedly shot, but the new team's goalkeeper Ai Gen was quite calm and defused the danger by saving the ball. After eight minutes, the new team took advantage of the Chinese team's rear emptiness and launched a sneak attack. New team winger Huo Meng scored a goal with a pass from center forward Peng Song, which was as fast as lightning. Two minutes later, Zhu Yongqiang took advantage of the new team's left full-back Sapp reb's defense and returned a goal, tying the score. In the 17th minute, Chinese team left inside forward Guo Yingqi knocked on the door, the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out, Zhu Yongqiang jumped forward and headed the ball into the net. The middle and rear were all under the control of the Chinese team, but the new team launched another sneak attack. New team right winger Ma Zhou passed through Chinese team right full-back Hou Rongsheng and shot on the ground, scoring a goal. Chinese goalkeeper Zhang Banglun was unable to save the ball. A few minutes later, a Chinese team player fouled in the penalty area and was penalized with a 25-yard free kick. New team left winger Qiu Xi kicked the ball into the net, and the new team took the lead with 3-2. Before long, Zhu Yongqiang dribbled straight in and scored a goal near the goal, tying the score at 3-3 in the first half. In the second half, it was easy to change sides and fight again, but there were not many highlights. Chinese team right winger He Yingfen crossed to Guo Yingqi, and Yingqi headed the ball into the net, resulting in a 4-3 victory.

### Three Australian Female Talents; Hopeful for the World Games; Hurdles, Sprint, Long Jump

[British News Agency, London Communication] Among the thirty-five athletes from Australia attending the current World Games in London, three are female athletes, namely Shelley Strickland (Western Australia), Joyce King (New South Wales), and Judith Condell (Sydney).

Strickland is tall, has blonde hair, and has a beautiful demeanor. Australians regard her as a very promising athlete in the World Games. In the Australian Games in January this year, her 100-yard hurdles race was equivalent to the world record of 11.6 seconds. That race was run on grass, and her compatriots believe that she will run better on the cinder track of the World Games and may even perform as well as Marlene Cadena (England) and Mrs. Blankers-Koen (Netherlands) in the 80-meter hurdles race.

Miss Strickland is 24 years old this year and is a mathematics lecturer at a university. She participated in sports competitions for the first time when she was a freshman at the University of Western Australia. At that time, she almost won every competition for freshman girls. As a result of her training with male athletes, there has been an improvement in the time and distance of each event.

Last year, when Australia held the National Lotus Games, she won five championships. In this year's sports games, she won the hurdles championship. In the two sprint finals, she was only second to Joyce King. Miss Strickland was taught by her father, Dave Strickland, who was once known as a famous sprinter in Western Australia.

Joyce King is a 27-year-old school teacher who won the Australian 100-yard championship in 11 seconds. Because she ran on grass that had just rained, her performance in this World Games is bound to improve. She participated in the 220-yard race and set a new Australian record of 24.9 seconds.

Judith Condell is a female student who won the Australian women's long jump championship with 18 feet 5 inches. She is 16 years old this year and is 5 feet 6 inches tall. She is one of Australia's famous female athletes in the future.

Strength Perspective

The candidate for the leader has not yet been officially appointed, because Finley, a fighter pilot who has repeatedly made great achievements during the war, has injured leg muscles. If he can recover in time, he will be appointed. He is still the fastest high-hurdle athlete in the world. In the 1932 World Games, he participated in the 110-meter final and won fourth place. Four years later, he won the runner-up in the World Games held in Berlin. If Finley's leg injury cannot be healed by then, Roberts will most likely serve as the leader. Roberts is the British athlete participating in the 400 meters. Pelay, the record holder for British sprint, will only participate in the 100-meter race, which may surprise people, because he stopped training due to a leg injury in the summer, so he chose the one he is best at. He has made great progress in recent weeks. McColl Gaudel, 22, is an excellent sprinter, and he is likely to win the 100-meter and 110-meter races. Barrid, a 23-year-old student at an art school in London, may also be listed among the world's winners. Harras, the record holder for New Zealand, is a world-class athlete in the half-mile race. Nanjivili is a strong opponent in the 1,500 meters. If Finley can recover, he will definitely take the lead in the 110-meter hurdles final. Brer, only 18 years old, is a British athlete participating in the 110-meter hurdles. He won the race in 15.1 seconds. He is still studying and is the youngest athlete in the UK. Qiu Char participated in the 10,000-meter race walking and broke the world record in recent weeks of practice. The record held by high jumper Babison is 6 feet 2 inches. Pole vaulter Webster ranked sixth in the last Berlin World Games and can maintain a record of 13 feet 6 inches. Horting is a marathon long-distance runner and is one of the most promising people in the British men's team. Hammer thrower Clark is also an outstanding person. The most outstanding people in the women's team are Mrs. Jordan in the 100 meters, Miss Cheeseman in the 200 meters, and Miss Cadena, who participated in the 80-meter hurdles, and recently set a new world record of 11.2 seconds. Mrs. Taylor participated in the high jump in the last World Games and won the runner-up.

### Mr. Hu Puan's First Anniversary Memorial

— Chen Yixian

Mr. Hu Puan passed away at 3:35 AM on July 9th of last year. Today marks the first anniversary. Remembering our past friendship, I cannot remain silent.

I had known Mr. Puan for twenty years, but we did not meet often. Our most frequent conversations occurred in the year before his death, and between 1933 and 1935 when he taught at Zhengfeng College (now renamed Chengming College). I will focus on these two periods.

In 1933, I began lecturing on Western History at Zhengfeng College, where Mr. Puan was also the Dean of Academics. At the same time, he also taught at Chizhi College and Jinan University, relying solely on a chartered car for transportation, rushing around all day (Chizhi was in Jiangwan, Jinan in Zhenru). A man who had served as the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department for two years, yet could not live without teaching, shows his character. During this period, I had frequent conversations with him, and was able to glimpse his scholarship. His method of learning was to first build up his own knowledge, as a foundation for handling affairs. He used writing as a tool for application, and reading as the basis for being a person. He focused on the doctrines of Gu Tinglin, Huang Lizhou, Wang Chuanshan, and Yan Xizhai. His initial approach was greatly influenced by the scholarship of Dai Dongyuan and Duan Wangcai. According to Mr. Puan, he was unwilling to be a scholar who only did textual research, but believed that to read Chinese books, one must start with textual research. Therefore, in addition to the four gentlemen Gu, Huang, Wang, and Yan, he added Dai and Duan as standards for learning. After reading the books of Dai and Duan, he realized that the tool of textual research lies in exegesis, and the foundation of exegesis lies in phonology. This was roughly the scope of his reading and personal conduct.

In July of the year before last (1946), after the school summer vacation began, Mr. Puan suddenly sent me a letter, wanting me to work at the Municipal Gazetteer Office (now renamed Shanghai Municipal Archives Committee). Although I intended to accept, I delayed going. Mr. Puan sent another letter urging me, and set a date to accompany me to the office. His sincerity towards friends was unmatched. I arrived at the office on August 1, 1946 (and left this March, having been there for one year and seven months). During breaks, I was able to talk with Mr. Puan often. At lunch, I saw him eat only a few fragrant olives, or a few slices of bread. I said that he was eating too little, and that the nutrition was insufficient, which might harm his health. Mr. Puan said, "Since Japan launched the Pacific War, I knew that food would become a problem, so I gradually reduced my food intake. Now, I only eat a small bowl of rice, and a little bit of vegetables for each meal. Although I eat less, I still read and write every day, and my spirit is the same." He also said, "Recently, I sleep on a chair, without going to bed. I get up before dawn, write more than a thousand words, and read several pages of books, before going to the office." From this, we can see that Mr. Puan was a strong-willed person, who could conquer matter with spirit.

Mr. Puan also taught Chinese Literature for the A group at the Law and Politics College. Two months before his death, his liver disease worsened. He wanted me to substitute for him, and I couldn't refuse. So, I lectured on his book "A Brief Discussion on Articles Throughout the Dynasties." The lecture notes mentioned "Three Ancestors," "Seven Scholars," "Zhengshi," "Yan Xu," etc. Even in his illness, he still annotated their origins. I substituted for Mr. Puan at the Law and Politics College for two weeks, until the end of the semester. Mr. Puan taught for decades, and I unexpectedly concluded his last course. This is also something unforgettable.

In April 1939, Mr. Puan suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. Although the treatment was effective, his left hand and left foot were unable to move from then on. [Editor's note: When Mr. Ye Chucang passed away in Shanghai the year before last, I met Mr. Puan at the funeral home. At that time, he could walk slowly. However, when viewing the layout of the mourning hall, he stumbled and almost fell. I rushed forward to support him, and took him to rest by the hall. Mr. Puan sat there silently, with tears in his eyes. This scene is as if it were happening right now, and Mr. Puan has already passed away! Reading Mr. Yixian's article to this point, I cannot help but feel deeply moved.] He still continued to read every day. His right hand could write. During the several years of his illness, he wrote several works of "Zhou Yi Ancient History View." In the year of his death, he wrote the booklet "The Road of Youth." Students who obtained it, all revered it as a treasure. Last July, I had a eulogy couplet for Mr. Puan, claiming that I still truly knew him as a person. It is recorded below, and used to conclude this article.

"He aspired to clarity early, but his talent was never fully developed. Returning from officialdom, he was still a poor scholar. Even now, his integrity is firm, and his noble demeanor corrects shallow customs.

Only with a stubborn personality, he had many regrets with the world. Now that you have passed away, who else knows you? It is not just that a teacher is hard to find, but that the students have lost their guidance."

### Inscription on Mr. Yu's Copy of "Returning Bamboo" Painting

— Shi Shufan

The ink bamboo painting was painted by Mr. Gui Zhuang (Yuangong) and given to Lu Anqing. The wind and rain are raging, each expressing its extreme state. At that time, the Ming Dynasty had already collapsed. The gentleman returned from Taihu Lake and created it in an ancient temple in Wuxing, with a detailed inscription. The inscription also includes nine sacrificial poems for loyalty, dedicated to Liu Niantai, Qi Jiabiao, and the late Zhongmin (諱邦曜) and other gentlemen. At the end of the scroll, there are also five quatrains of five characters each by Gu Tinglin mourning Yuangong, with many taboo words, so they were not included in the original edition. Yu Yueyuan of Longyou once imitated it, and left it to Mr. He Yangling, which I inscribed for remembrance. Now, the desolate clouds have set, the moon has fallen, and both the person and the music are fragrant. Thinking of it fills my chest with pain!

Red lanterns overhead annotate the Six Secret Teachings, with hands shielding mountains and rivers and white clouds soaring high. As long as a section embodies loyalty and love, paper and ink communicate spiritually, even in dreams, it is a laborious task.

This bamboo, like a person, has a clear backbone, silently embracing foolish love. Who will be its friend three hundred years later? Only a poetic beard walking under the moon.

White hair, spring lamp, and ink sea are deep. Ice flowers copied are worth a thousand gold. One oddity is truly comparable to a complete history, in which there is a solitary scholar with a steadfast heart.

Once inscribed with a brush of frost on the Huai River bank, I embrace the creek rattan and enter long dreams. I offer clear lament as if eating wheat rice, no need for wind and dew to bow to Gui Zhuang.

Endless moaning in the reeds by the river, even more painting ten thousand bamboos expressing mournful sounds. A scholar's foolish indignation, I can recognize, stealing a breath in the world, watching the sinking of the nation.

Drunk and silent, ink tears flowing, deciding to offer heads to sacrificial poems for loyalty. It's hard to distinguish between the previous dynasty and the current era. Letting my hair down and asking the sky for a moment.

Layers of waves contain "eternal sorrow," (name of a tune composed by Yuangong) the remaining water of the Zhu family, the Lu family's building. Unable to grow a thousand feet overnight, cut it into a flute to blow to the top of my head.

Whether merchants, monks, or drinkers, heroes are all old Jianghu. Who dies first to be buried by the blue sky, just look at the rootless ink bamboo painting.

The lake waves sob, the setting sun burns, only mourn for the remnants of the previous dynasty in the wilderness. I am Tinglin, I should cry bitterly, regretting the lack of righteousness to escape from Kunshan.

Past events are clearly unbearable, poetry and writing cannot save a dying nation. High sky, short hat, dying with a sword across, ultimately better than getting drunk in a field near Taihu Lake.

### Concert on Xuanwu Lake

— Qiao Long

It is the height of summer again, but this year there is still no news of the Shanghai Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra holding its summer evening weekend outdoor concerts.

Last week, I went to Nanjing and happened to attend a summer weekend performance by the Capital China Symphony Orchestra at the Cuizhou open-air concert hall on Xuanwu Lake at the invitation of a friend. The experience was quite good.

After the capital was relocated to Nanjing, there were two symphony orchestras that came back from Chongqing. One belonged to the Lizi Society and mostly performed for foreign guests; the other was the China Symphony Orchestra led and conducted by Mr. Lin Shengxi. At that time, although there was a magnificent open-air concert stage near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, the journey was too far after all, and the summer open-air concerts were all in the evening, so the transportation problem was difficult to solve, making regular performances impossible.

In the second year after the victory, after discussions by the municipal government and other relevant parties, it was considered that Cuizhou on Xuanwu Lake was very ideal: not far from the city center, and without the noise of vehicles and horses. However, there was still no funding for building an indoor concert hall. As a second best option, the open-air stage that is currently used for performances was built.

The style of the stage is similar to that in Zhaofeng Park in Shanghai, but the one there is wider and can accommodate a symphony orchestra of more than sixty people. The lighting equipment is also ideal. The stage is semi-spherical, standing on the ground, with the back covered with lead sheets, reflecting the sunlight, adding a lot of brilliance to Xuanwu Lake at sunset.

This year's summer weekend open-air concerts are the first performances since the completion of the concert stage. The schedule includes eight weeks, from May 23rd to July 11th, postponed in case of rain. However, unfortunately, it started with two rainy weekends in a row, so it was effectively delayed by two weeks. The ticket price is 30,000 yuan per show, which is really too cheap.

The content of the music is both high in quality and quantity. Each time, it starts at 7:45 PM and lasts until around 9:30 PM. The first week included Beethoven's Eroica Symphony, Schubert's Rosamunde Overture, Haydn's Dances, etc.

The China Symphony Orchestra was established in the wartime capital during the Anti-Japanese War. The entire team has better talent in stringed instruments, and the wind instruments are relatively poor, which is inevitable.

Every weekend afternoon, I rowed a boat on Xuanwu Lake (the boats there are especially cheap, only 100,000 yuan for two hours), and at about seven o'clock, I bought a ticket and sat on the grass in front of the concert stage (there are no chairs there, and a mat is issued with the ticket). When the concert starts, the sun has not yet set. At this time, a touch of afterglow reflects the sky, the city walls, and the lake. Watching the evening birds returning to the forest, the summer heat gradually dissipates, truly a summer scene on the lake. When the concert is over, if there is a moon, I look for a small boat in the moonlight and row back to the city; if there is no moonlight, I walk home along the faint lights on the Cuihong Causeway. It is truly an ideal weekend pastime in the city. Ling Yu

### Eccentricities of Celebrities

British scholar Dr. Johnson, the founder of the English dictionary, was highly respected. However, he opposed using teaspoons. No matter how dirty his fingers were, he always used his hands to stir the sugar in his lemon tea.

American literary giant Hawthorne deliberately wrote his calligraphy in a bizarre style during his student days, in order to "look like a writer." After his death, some of his manuscripts could not be printed for many years because no one could read them.

Jurist Holmes had many quirks, one of which was writing letters while standing. When someone asked him why he didn't sit down to write, he said that sitting down to write letters would make them too long.

### Cost of Living Index

— Suo Bei

The times have allowed people to understand more common sense of economics. For example, the cost of living index. Before the victory, most people felt that this "new term" was unfamiliar, but now it is a household name, and even newspaper boys can recite it fluently. It is reported that the boatmen rowing on the Huangpu River have also adjusted their wages according to the cost of living index.

Difficult times have brought about the "index problem." The more the index is valued, and the more it becomes a problem, the more the economy declines.

The index in China today has one characteristic: it only goes up, and is unwilling to lag behind. In fact, the "index" should be renamed "price increase number."

In Shanghai, the index has two wonderful points:

First, the index clearly comes from prices, but merchants change their prices based on the index. In the world, nothing is more illogical than this.

Second, the compilation of the index clearly has a certain formula and method, and there is only one answer. However, in reality, it can be discussed in meetings and bargained over. Nothing is more ridiculous than this!

### Giraffe

— He Dao

In European and American circuses or zoos, giraffes are one of the most popular animals, but unfortunately, our zoos do not have giraffes.

The giraffe's personality is extremely gentle and docile, and it can sometimes be bitten by cats. However, when it is angry, it can also kill a pair of lions with one kick.

People who raise giraffes mostly like to adopt young deer. Grown-up giraffes are too tall (eighteen feet) to be transported by train.

Although the giraffe's head and neck are long, it does not make any sound. Moreover, it can go without drinking water for several weeks, like a camel.

Hull's memoirs describe the intricate relations in Europe between the two World Wars: "France hoped that Germany's strength would be below it, and could not agree to any method that approached equality in German military equipment. On the other hand, Britain did not like France occupying a high and commanding position on the mainland, and hoped to create a balance of power in Europe, so that its own strength could become the decisive factor." This is a record of facts, not only a record of a period, but also a record of Britain's traditional national policy. This old British national policy was established by Wolsey, the first strategist of Henry VIII. In view of the past failures in military management on the European continent, he insisted on the belief of maintaining a balance of power without war, as the most economical self-defense strategy, which had considerable reasons both geographically and historically. Britain is an island nation outside the continent, surrounded by the sea. Sea power is developed, the navy is superior, and water transportation extends to all corners of the world. Territories in all continents of the world are covered with the "rice" character flag, which is enough to dominate the world, and there is no need to occupy a part of the European continent, nor is it possible. However, if the European continent is dominated by one country, the three islands bordering the sea will feel a great threat.

In terms of historical geography, the continental countries of Europe are always dominated by France, which is also closest to Britain. During the Hundred Years' War in the fourteenth century and the Napoleonic Wars in the nineteenth century, the British mainland was repeatedly on the verge of danger. There has long been a historical fact that two tigers cannot coexist. Germany and France are also age-old enemies. After the Great War and Napoleon, William, who advocated militarism, greatly dreamed of his world empire, greatly developed the navy, and managed maritime power, competing with the "Sea King" of Britain for hegemony, making enemies on all sides, and recklessly engaging in military affairs, which led to the First European War. Britain and France were in the same situation of interests, jointly resisted Germany, and all the Allied countries worked together to defeat the William Empire. After Germany surrendered, France suddenly raised its head high again. Clemenceau, the so-called "Tiger Prime Minister," looked down on everything and regarded himself as the master of the victorious country. President Wilson's Fourteen Points were invalid, and Prime Minister George was also suppressed, feeling uneasy in his heart. France's conditions for Germany were harsh, although for prevention, Britain was again worried about France's dominance on the mainland. Therefore, it indulged the German side, gradually promoted and supported it, in order to control it, which was still the old trick of the "balance of power" on the mainland policy. But unexpectedly, Hitler rose, recklessly worked hard, was unreasonable, and progressed with every step, becoming more prosperous with every reward. The Second World War eventually broke out. From this point of view, the old British "balance of power policy" and "non-war doctrine," although an economical calculation, also had the bitter truth of being difficult to get cheap.
