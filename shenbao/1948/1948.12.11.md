### The Bengbu-Suzhou Campaign Becomes More Promising; Northern Expeditionary Forces Forcefully Cross the Xie River and Continue Advance; Deng Wenyi Carries President's Handwritten Letter to the Frontlines to Encourage the Soldiers

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] The progress of the Nationalist forces in the central and southern battlefields of the Bengbu-Suzhou campaign indicates that the initial victory of this campaign is imminent. According to the current battle situation, the convergence of Huang Wei and Li Yannian's army corps will occur tomorrow or the day after. Li Yannian, at the frontlines, expressed his extremely optimistic assessment to a certain general, stating that the Liu Fei's Second Column and Chen Fei's Sixth Column, which are obstructing between the Huang and Li positions, will inevitably face complete annihilation. Note: Today, intense battles are taking place in all three major battlefields within the Bengbu-Suzhou war zone. Since Li's army corps intensified its attack northward, Liu Fei's main force has been launching fierce attacks on Huang's army corps positions. In the southeast of Shuangzhunji, the bandits have captured several villages, and the small airfield of the Nationalist forces in that area was once threatened. Today, that unit has retaken the area in a bloody battle, and has also routed a bandit division. Today, under the cover of an armored vehicle group commanded by Chief of Staff Jiang Weiguo, Li's army corps captured Dagouji (30 li northwest of Huoshen Temple) in one fell swoop, separated by only 40 li from Dayingji, the southeastern stronghold of Huang's army corps. In addition, Mr. Deng Wenyi arrived in Bengbu from Nanjing by special plane this afternoon, and immediately traveled by car to the frontlines to deliver the President's handwritten letter to Li Yannian and the commanders of various units. Encouraged by the President, the generals were able to achieve this significant progress on the southern front.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] It is reliably learned that the vanguard of a Nationalist army unit advancing northward along the Jinpu Railway has reached the vicinity of Guzhen. It is reported that there are only a few remnant bandits near the iron bridge, and the Nationalist army will soon capture the area. Furthermore, according to informed sources, the supplies for the army corps marching south from Xuzhou are now being airdropped.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] After continuous days of battle, the current situation of the Nationalist army's Qiu and Li army corps marching south is as follows: Qiu's army corps is positioned northeast of Yongcheng, and Li's army corps is near Laozulou. Between the two army corps, the Bandit's Liangguang Column is in Mengji, and the First Column and New Eighth Column are in Zhangzhuangzhai. The 27th Division of the Bandit's Ninth Column is in the area of Wang Liuyuan, Huazhuang, and Liuhe, northeast of Qiu's army corps. South of the Qiu and Li army corps, there are Ji Geng's Ninth Column, Chen Yi's Third and Fourth Columns, and the Wu Huawen and He Jifeng units who defected to the bandits (in the area north of Suixikou), the Tenth and Sixteenth Columns (in Qinglongji Wangzhuang), the Third Column (in Dahui Chuan), and parts of the Seventh and Eighth Columns (southeast of Yongcheng). Note that the Nationalist army is constantly launching attacks on this line. Yesterday, they severely damaged the bandits in the areas of Mengji and Dahui Chuan, and intense battles are still taking place today.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] Our southward advancing army corps has recently completed an arc-shaped encirclement against Chen Yi's bandit troops between Yongcheng and Suixikou.

On the evening of the 9th, Huang Wei's army corps engaged in fierce battles with the bandits all night in the vicinity of Nanpingji and Shuangduiji, south of Su County. Both sides fired thousands of shells. Huang Wei's army corps is still expanding outward. After achieving victory northeast of Yongcheng, Du Yuming, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, is leading the southward army corps to mop up the remaining bandits.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Neutral sources believed on the 10th that the war in the triangular region of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan may be decided in the next few days. Both the Nationalists and Communists have placed their most elite troops in this war zone. In fact, the Nationalist army has the advantage, because since the Battle of Xuzhou, most of the Communist army has been on the front lines, while the Nationalist army has an endless supply of reinforcements arriving on the front lines. Another advantage of the Nationalist army is that it has better transportation lines and supply bases.

### Morrison Hall at the University of Hong Kong Reopens; Governor Grantham Calls for Resistance to Communism; Gurkha Rifles from Malaya to Reinforce Hong Kong

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 9th Dispatch] Morrison Hall, one of the dormitories of the University of Hong Kong destroyed during the Japanese occupation, officially reopened this afternoon. During the opening ceremony, Governor Grantham of Hong Kong delivered a speech in which Mr. Wan recalled how some boarders of Morrison Hall before the war had died fighting to defend Hong Kong from Germany and Fascist Japan. But today we are faced with another despotic system, namely the despotic system of communism. The cruelty and inhumanity of communism, which disregards human rights, is no different from Fascist tyrants. The Governor continued: What the Communist Party must understand is that our freedom-loving people will rise up and resist once attacked. We cannot compromise with communism, nor can we compromise with evil.

Pan is currently staying at his private residence on Jingwu Road, remaining indoors and refusing visitors, and his intentions are passive.

### The President Orders Strict Suppression of Black Market and Arbitrage for Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange; Improved Exchange Methods to be Implemented on Monday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] It is reliably learned that the President recently received reports that there has been black market trading of gold and foreign exchange again recently, and that the Central Bank's handling of deposit exchange of gold and silver is often exploited by scalpers for profit. He has now handwritten instructions to the security authorities to strictly suppress the black market of gold and foreign exchange and the scalping phenomenon.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The Central Bank's handling of deposit exchange of gold and silver coins has been implemented in various places. Recently, unscrupulous people have been exploiting the system for profit, openly buying and selling gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and buying silver coins at high prices. The Ministry of Finance has issued a circular to strictly suppress these activities and investigate and deal with them according to the law in order to maintain law and order.

### Applications Require Identification

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Since the implementation of deposit exchange of gold and silver, the exchange situation in various places has been very chaotic, and there have been incidents of bank runs and scalpers profiting from arbitrage. After research and discussion in the past two days, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have formulated improved methods for deposit exchange of gold and silver, which will be implemented on the 13th. There are three main points of the improved methods: (1) In order to prevent scalpers from profiting from arbitrage, in the future, deposit exchange of gold and silver will be changed to an application registration and approval notification method, and the applicant must personally handle it with their own identification. All people who exchange gold and silver must first apply for registration, pay the money with the purchase application registration form, and receive the approval letter. The next day, they can exchange gold or silver dollars with the approval letter and their own identification. The number of silver dollars exchanged will still be handled according to the previous method. There is no limit to the number of times gold can be exchanged. However, special attention will be paid to suppressing scalping. Each time a person exchanges gold and silver, a gold or silver character will be stamped on their identification for reference. (2) The number of exchange locations will be increased. In addition to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China will also handle the exchange at the same time, so that the majority of people will have the opportunity to deposit and exchange gold and silver. (3) Public opinion and the opinions of the general public have expressed dissatisfaction with wealthy and large households rushing to buy large amounts of gold. In order to prevent gold from being concentrated in the hands of wealthy and large households, appropriate restrictions will be placed on wealthy and large households and others who rush to exchange large amounts of gold. Each person will be limited to ten taels of gold at a time. However, the purpose of this restriction is purely to prevent excessive concentration of gold. The above methods will be announced and implemented on the 13th. Officials from the Ministry of Finance were dispatched to the Central Bank on the morning of the 10th to discuss the technical issues of implementation and agreed that various preparatory work should be completed on the 12th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] In the past, the Central Bank gave preferential treatment to its employees in handling deposit exchange of gold and silver, and did not handle it according to the exchange methods for citizens. Now, in addition to the fact that the President of the Central Bank, Yu Hongjun, has personally instructed that it must be handled according to general procedures, the new improved methods formulated by the Ministry of Finance also strictly stipulate that in the future, anyone must apply for registration and exchange with their own identification, and Central Bank employees are no exception.

Also No Possibility of Compromise with Communists

[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th Dispatch] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly today stated frankly that Chinese diplomats have no intention of compromising with any possible communist regime in Nanjing. Jiang Tingfu, the chief representative of China, issued a strongly worded statement to the editors of the New York Times, categorically denying the points contained in a special dispatch sent from Paris by C. L. Sulzberger, the newspaper's correspondent in Paris, and recently published by the newspaper. Mr. Jiang sent a telegram to the editors of the New York Times. The telegram, which was published in Paris today, stated: The Chinese delegation hereby categorically rejects the points made in the special dispatch from Paris on December 4 by C. L. Sulzberger, namely the so-called plan of the Chinese government to move to Taiwan, and that important Chinese figures will refuse to move to He Wan and are willing to "reach a harmonious relationship with the new communist regime in Nanjing." The Chinese delegation hereby announces the following points: (1) The delegation has not received reports regarding the Chinese government moving to Taiwan, or anywhere else. (2) The delegation is also unaware of so-called important Chinese figures who intend to "reach a harmonious relationship with the communist regime." (3) Chinese diplomats stationed in Paris have no intention of reaching a harmonious relationship with any communist regime in any part of China. (4) The delegation firmly believes that the establishment of a communist regime in China would mean the end of individual and national freedom in China. Please publish the statement issued by the delegation today in the same prominent position as the special dispatch from your newspaper's correspondent.

### Supplemental General Budget Approved; President Orders Announcement

### General Survey of the Situation of Residents in the Capital Began Yesterday

### Madame Chiang Meets with Truman; Methodist Bishops Urge Increased Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] President Truman hosted a tea party for Madame Chiang at 5:00 p.m. on the 10th (6:00 a.m. on the 11th Shanghai time), accompanied by the First Lady and Mrs. Marshall.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th Dispatch] President Truman indirectly indicated at a press conference on the 9th that he may meet with Madame Chiang several more times after hosting a tea party for her tomorrow.

[United Press, Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania, 10th Dispatch] After learning of the report from the bishops stationed in China regarding the current situation in China, Bishop Corson of the Methodist Church issued a statement today urging the US government to aid China. He stated, in brief, that if the United States does not save China from danger today at a smaller price, then once the Communist Party controls China, the United States will have to spend a huge cost of ten billion US dollars to revive Japanese military equipment and establish a base in the Philippines. Why should the United States hesitate and delay, and pay the small price, and instead let our children and grandchildren pay the heavy price of their ancestors' stupidity and negligence? President Chiang of China has been meritorious to the United States. At the time of the Pearl Harbor Incident, President Chiang restrained 2 million elite Japanese troops in China. If these Japanese troops were used to attack the United States, then the US operations in the Far East would have been more bloody and the time would have been longer. We are now helping President Chiang purely to express our gratitude. The bishops of the Methodist Church going to China agree with my views.

Note that Madame Chiang graduated from the school.

### Draft Postal and Telecommunications Inspection Regulations Amended and Approved by the Legislative Yuan; Case of Accusing the Soviet Union Handed Over to the Foreign Affairs Committee for Review; Three Cases, Including Adjusting Postal Rates, Returned to the Executive Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The 27th meeting of the Second Session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 10th, starting at 9:30 a.m. Both the President and Vice President were absent due to reasons. Committee member Cheng Tianfang was elected as the chairman by public vote. After reading the report, the various bills submitted by the government for review were mostly handed over for review separately. However, the case of the Executive Yuan requesting review of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations, which had been approved by the President, and requesting the Legislative Yuan to review the case of adjusting the domestic mail rate table and the case of reviewing the amended clauses of the Household Registration Law were rejected, because the documents were sent to the Legislative Yuan with the signature of "President Sun Ke". The committee members believed that Mr. Sun had not formally resigned from the position of President of the Legislative Yuan to take office as President of the Executive Yuan, and the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan had prematurely issued documents in the name of Mr. Sun, which was inappropriate, so they were not accepted. As for the draft Republic of China Red Cross Society Law, its purpose, nature, organization, etc. are mostly inconsistent with the International Red Cross Convention and the precedents of Red Cross societies in various countries. It was decided to return it to the Executive Yuan for re-amendment and then sent to the Yuan for review. After the report was completed, three confidential cases were discussed in secret: (1) The draft Regulations on Postal and Telecommunications Inspection during the Period of Suppression of the Rebellion was resolved to be amended and passed according to the review opinions. (2) Qi Zhihou and others proposed that the Soviet Union assist the CCP in occupying the Northeast and threatening world peace, and proposed that the government file a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly. (3) Liu Zhaoxun and others proposed that the government file a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly against the Soviet Union's breach of contract and bad faith, demanding that the Soviet Union fulfill the treaty, compensate for the losses, be responsible for expelling the CCP, and return the territorial sovereignty to the government. If no result is obtained, the government will immediately announce the abolition of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and related agreements in order to revitalize international prestige and maintain world peace. The two cases are similar in nature, and after a joint discussion, the debate lasted for a long time. There was no result until 11:00 a.m., and the meeting was adjourned due to a power outage. The meeting continued at 3:45 p.m., still chaired by Cheng Tianfang. As a result of the discussion of cases (2) and (3), it was decided to hand them over to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review. At 4:30 p.m., an open meeting was held to continue discussing general cases: (4) The amendment of the draft Seven Association Law was carried out in the third reading meeting, and it was resolved to pass it with slight textual amendments. (5) The cases of the Capital Garrison District (6) Shanghai City (7) Quzhou Pacification District declaring temporary martial law were resolved to be approved. (8) The Finance and Economics Committee reported on the joint review of the draft Republic of China 37th Year Consolidation Public Bond Regulations and the various bond ticket redemption and interest payment tables. Committee member Liu Zhendong and others proposed amending the Measures for Consolidating Foreign Currency and National Currency Public Bonds promulgated by the Executive Yuan to show fairness and reduce the burden on the national treasury. It was resolved to pass the Executive Yuan's original plan according to the review opinions. (9) The Legislative Yuan and Supervisory Yuan committee members' application for taking out foreign passports and the review standards were resolved to be passed according to the review opinions and sent to the Executive Yuan for reply. If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the current Foreign Passport Regulations need to be amended, it should draft an amendment and submit it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review. Before the amendment procedure is completed, it will still be handled according to past practices, and there is no need to set another temporary standard. (10) The draft Law on Subsidies and Incentives for Private Vocational Schools and Above was resolved to be passed according to the review opinions, because the Ministry of Education had already set out the General Outline of the Method for Allocating Subsidies for Private Vocational Schools and Above, and there is no need to reset it in reality. However, according to the opinions put forward by the original proposal's refined version, a question was raised to the Executive Yuan. Finally, Zhang Zhijiang, Li Yu, and others held a temporary motion to send a telegram to Sun Ke, requesting him to return to Nanjing immediately to take office as President of the Executive Yuan and form a new cabinet to promote government orders and benefit the work of suppressing the rebellion. Most committee members believed that Mr. Sun was indeed delayed in Shanghai due to illness, and there was a scheduled date for Jin Jing. It was inappropriate and unnecessary to send a telegram in the name of the Legislative Yuan. However, Li Yu and others insisted on their opinions, and finally the number of committee members present was insufficient to meet the quorum, and the vote could not be taken, so it was postponed to the next regular meeting for further discussion. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 p.m.

### Presidential Order Promulgated: National Martial Law Zone

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] President's order of December 10th is as follows: Now, in accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Provisions of the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Rebellion, and upon the resolution of the Executive Yuan, (1) Martial law is declared in all provinces and cities of the country except for the four provinces of Xinjiang, Xikang, Qinghai, and Taiwan, and Tibet.

Heads of various Chinese and foreign circles, including Weng Wenhao, Wu Guozhen, and Lapham, will go to the airport to welcome him today.

### Editorial: The UN General Assembly Breaks Up Unhappily Again

The United Nations General Assembly adjourned today. This session lasted for a record two and a half months. However, this General Assembly achieved nothing. Not to mention that one-third of the agenda items were not discussed, none of the items that were put forward for discussion reached an agreement. For more than eighty days, we only saw the representatives of various countries in the Palais de Chaillot in Paris engaging in heated debates, arguing until they were red in the face, unwilling to give up. However, solving the problems was just a waste of words, and no compromise solution could be found. Therefore, this General Assembly not only wasted time but also wasted money. Not to mention the expenses of the delegations of various countries in Paris, the expenses of the General Assembly alone amounted to 356,000 US dollars in two and a half months, which is really not worth the loss. The representatives of the participating countries, after self-examination, also admitted that this meeting involved "more debate, less action." Prolonging it would not help the actual situation, so they had to decide to adjourn the meeting early and leave the unfinished business to be discussed at a meeting in Lake Success in April next year. The unhappy breakup of the United Nations General Assembly not only illustrates the weakness of the United Nations organization, which is in danger of encountering a similar fate to the old League of Nations, but also shows the seriousness of the current international situation.

When the United Nations General Assembly opened in the Palais de Chaillot, political commentators generally anticipated the bleak future of the United Nations organization but still hoped that it could safely overcome various serious tests and become an effective international organization for maintaining world peace. Unexpectedly, contrary to expectations, after the UN General Assembly opened, the shadow of the "Cold War" immediately cast itself into the Palais de Chaillot. In the first round of the Cold War, Soviet representative Vyshinsky took the initiative in everything. From advocating a one-third reduction in armaments to banning atomic weapons, all were proactive suggestions from the Soviet representative, with the intention of forcing the Western powers to show their cards. Therefore, Marshall and Bevin used the "Berlin blockade issue," which "threatened world peace," as a "Cold War" weapon to counter the Soviet Union. However, this Berlin issue was indeed the most severe test facing the UN General Assembly. Whether this issue could be resolved was truly a touchstone for whether the United Nations organization was effective or not. Therefore, those who truly cared for the United Nations organization were worried about the UN General Assembly's handling of the Berlin issue, and concerned about the future of the United Nations.

The six neutral countries in the Security Council have indeed done their best to mediate the Berlin issue. The proposals of Lie and Evatt for the four powers to reopen negotiations were still a preliminary step in breaking the Berlin stalemate. However, the British and American sides insisted on lifting the Berlin blockade first, and then the four powers reopening negotiations. The Soviet Union believed that the Berlin blockade was a consequence of the Anglo-American policy of dividing Germany and could not put the cart before the horse, and still insisted on negotiating first and then lifting the blockade. Finally, although the Soviet Union also expressed concessions, making the Berlin issue seem to have taken a turn for the better, it still insisted that the implementation of a unified currency system in Berlin should be carried out simultaneously with the lifting of the blockade, which was rejected by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Therefore, additional problems arose, causing the Berlin issue to

have one wave not yet subsided before another rose. Before the Berlin issue could break the stalemate, the most thorny issues of Palestine and Korea were raised for discussion. Not to mention that the opinions expressed by the representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union on these issues were diametrically opposed, even the proposal by China, the United States, and Australia to establish a "New Korean Committee" was rejected by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Korean issue, like the Berlin issue, was delayed in an "inconclusive" manner. US Acting Chief Representative Dulles, indignant at the stalemate in the Korean issue, loudly appealed in the UN Political Committee, threatening the entire world with terror and violence, and calling on the UN countries to unite. He said: "If the non-communist countries of the world unite to oppose the Communist Party's strategy, then those who rely solely on military coercion and terror to achieve certain international political goals will know that it is difficult to succeed, and the greatest hope for peace lies in this." Mr. Dulles' words are extremely painful and a penetrating judgment. However, we must ask, since the United States wants to oppose communism, since it knows that non-communist countries should unite, then why "Europe first, Asia second"? And why should it disregard China, the vanguard of anti-communism? The lack of firmness and the inconsistency of US foreign policy are indeed factors that have created the current stalemate. If you don't advance, you retreat. Between advancing and retreating, the United States cannot hesitate. The United States' attitude of calling for "anti-communism" on one hand and waiting for China to climb the hundred-foot tower of "anti-communism" and then "removing the ladder midway" is completely contrary to the purpose of uniting anti-communist countries. We hope that the United States will make a wise choice soon!

### Seven Countries Proposed a Supplementary Plan for the Holy Land; UN General Assembly Will Definitely Pass; Korea and Human Rights Declaration Commence Final Intense Debate; UN General Assembly Set to Conclude Today

[United Press, Paris, 10th] Seven important countries of the United Nations formally moved on the 10th that the Bernadotte Plan will no longer be mentioned in the future. This happened when the UN General Assembly was trying hard to break the East-West conflict over the Declaration of Human Rights. After numerous lengthy speeches, the final actions on the Palestine and Korea issues will be taken, as the 11th is the closing day of the General Assembly. The new motion on Palestine is not unexpected. In the past few days, the original proposals of the UK and US have been constantly revised in order to reduce the components of the original proposal so that the General Assembly can finally pass it by a two-thirds majority. (Note: Bernadotte was assassinated in Jerusalem shortly before the opening of the UN General Assembly. His proposed Holy Land plan was quickly accepted by the West and intended to be used as the basis for resolving the Holy Land dispute. But now it has lost its moving nature.) The supplementary proposal has been jointly proposed by France, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, and Brazil, and does not mention the Bernadotte Plan at all. This case will definitely be passed by the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority. The original British and American proposal advocated that the mediation committee be appointed by the five powers. The supplementary case has been cancelled, and even the powers of the committee have been greatly reduced. The seven countries intend to cancel the suggestion of instructing the mediation committee to "promote friendly relations between the Holy Land of Israel and its Arab neighbors." Its functions will be clearly stipulated by the UN General Assembly or the Security Council.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] UN officials announced today that the Israeli government has notified Palestinian Acting Mediator Bunche that it agrees to gradually withdraw its troops from the southern Negev region through negotiations. If this is achieved, the 1,200 Egyptian troops in the Fallujah area can be released. At that time, Egypt will have the opportunity to negotiate a truce with Israel.

[United Press, Paris, 9th] Israel's slim hope of joining the United Nations this year was wiped out on the 9th when the Security Council cancelled the 10th meeting to consider this issue. The cancellation of the meeting was due to the illness of US Representative Jessup. According to US law, Mr. Jessup is the only representative who can vote for the United States in the Security Council. He is currently hospitalized with bronchitis.

### Churchill Encourages Government to Try to Stop the Cold War between East and West; Advocates Restoring Relations with Spain

Britain should restore diplomatic relations with Spain and immediately send a representative to the State of Israel.

Churchill declared that the UK and the US should maintain cooperation, because the close unity of English-speaking countries is closely tied to human freedom and the hope for the survival of most of us. Regarding German policy, Churchill pointed out that France, which has suffered the most, should be allowed to lead Germany back to the European international family in this situation. Churchill also criticized the Labor Party's policy on Palestine, saying that no policy in the government's policy is more wrong and improperly handled than the Palestine policy. (The above is Agence France-Presse's dispatch)

### Britain Will Definitely Send Troops to Assist Jordan if Attacked

[Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] Responsible sources claim that if Transjordan requests assistance from Britain due to an attack by Israeli forces, Britain will send troops to assist in accordance with the Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of March 1948. Officials also pointed out that two columns of Jewish troops invaded Transjordanian territory at the end of November. Jewish troops departing from the Dead Sea are now advancing towards a small Transjordanian port on the Red Sea. Although the King of Transjordan has not yet requested British assistance, British and Transjordanian authorities are in constant contact.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 10th] King Abdullah of Transjordan informed the Egyptian government today that he personally agrees with the Egyptian government's position on the fate of Palestine.

This decision was recently overturned by the Arab Congress convened in Jericho, which decided that Abdullah should concurrently serve as King of Palestine.

### Soviet Union Intensifies Berlin Blockade, Automobile Traffic Cut Off

[United Press, Berlin, 10th] The division of Berlin is becoming increasingly apparent, with automobile traffic between East and West Berlin cut off on the 10th. New Soviet instructions direct German police to prevent vehicles from crossing the border at the demarcation line in the city center. The new traffic ban aims to prevent goods from the Soviet-occupied zone from flowing into the West, which is another step by the Soviets to tighten the blockade around Berlin. However, underground and elevated trains can still travel between East and West Berlin. Mail is still not exchanged between the two districts, and checkpoints along the Soviet border stop all vehicles, with only those holding special permits allowed to pass.

Vyshinsky accused the declaration of supporting fascist breeders and glorifying warlords and murderous scientists, and said that the Soviet Union would not recognize it if the Assembly passed it in its current form. Roosevelt advocated for immediate passage, stating, "The Soviet Union's attempt to delay amending the Declaration of Human Rights until the last minute seems deliberately intended to embarrass the Assembly. We Americans admire those who fight for their beliefs. The Soviet delegation has fought for its beliefs, but sometimes we must submit to the will of the majority. When we have fought and been opposed by the majority, it is better to try to cooperate." The entire chamber responded with applause.

### Soviet Union's New Proposal for Controlling Japan Rejected by Far Eastern Commission; US Representative Declares That Japanese Zaibatsu Have Been Largely Dissolved

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, issued a statement today announcing that the United States had rejected the Soviet Union's proposals regarding Japanese policy in the Far Eastern Commission. The ambassador stated that the Soviet Union's policy towards Japan "would allow the free development of Japan's peaceful industries, while prohibiting Japan's war industries." The ambassador also stated that the other Allied countries' rejection of the Soviet Union's proposals indicates that they want Japan to be used by them.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Far Eastern Commission today rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an international organization to prevent the revival of Japan's wartime industries by a vote of ten to one. Earlier, US Representative McCoy announced that the Japanese zaibatsu had been largely dissolved, and that the US-proposed control plan, namely Far Eastern Commission Directive No. 230, had also become obsolete, making the establishment of a new control organization unnecessary. Other representatives supported the US position.

### US Far East Policy: Building Anti-Communist Fortress in Japan

Pessimistic About Situation on Asian Continent

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Many foreign observers here believe that the current US Far East policy is to establish an anti-communist base in Japan, rather than on the Asian continent. They also believe that this policy will become increasingly clear in the future. Unless the US policy undergoes a major shift and decides to make a final attempt to salvage the crisis of the Chinese government, this fact will not change. However, there is no doubt that Japan will be a "precious fortress" between the United States and communist Asia. Japanese officials hope for large-scale US investment and therefore eagerly desire that the communists be blocked in China. Japanese officials are eager for the Chinese government to overcome the crisis because they believe that a communist China poses a real threat to the Japanese authorities. Therefore, Japanese officials are also eager for the United States to expand aid to China.

### Truman Accuses House Un-American Activities Committee of "Red-Baiting"

Rumors of a British cabinet reshuffle are related to Belcher's resignation. According to the "Daily Mail," Prime Minister Attlee is studying the court's report on Belcher's bribery case, and whether or not to reshuffle the cabinet will depend on the outcome of this study.

[United Press, Shanghai] US Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, Lieutenant General Badger, announced at a press conference yesterday morning that he is dispatching a Marine Corps contingent on a transport ship immediately to Shanghai to protect American lives and property, including the Shanghai Power Company. He said that the Marines would not live in onshore barracks but would remain on the transport ships, landing only when American lives and property are threatened.

He further stated that there are currently an estimated 2,500 American residents in Shanghai, all of whom can take refuge on warships moored in the Huangpu River along the Bund in the future.

He stated that the US has obtained broad agreement from the Chinese authorities regarding this plan. Badger said, "We are closely monitoring the situation in China. If the circumstances require it, we will dispatch a considerable number of Marines to Shanghai to do our utmost to protect lives and, to the extent practicable, protect commerce, equipment, and essential American interests. We do not intend to replace local police with US troops, but will only use them in the event that the local authorities are unable to control the situation. He will do his best to reassure Chinese people that the United States has no intention of permanent activity. He said, "We are not here to participate in the Chinese civil war, but to protect Americans. It is clearly impossible to take responsibility for protecting all American property in Shanghai, but we believe we can protect important property. In the future, all Americans in Shanghai may be ordered to take refuge on warships. If the situation permits, they may be allowed to stay ashore to work during the day and return to the ships at night. Once the situation returns to normal, the Marine Corps will withdraw. He will also consider the needs of non-American Westerners, but they will not be allowed to take refuge on US ships. Badger estimated that there are enough merchant ships in the Nanjing-Shanghai area that can be mobilized in three or four hours to protect 18,000 people from danger. Badger declined to comment on the number of Marines who will be coming to Shanghai, but it is speculated that the main force of the Marines currently in Qingdao can arrive in Shanghai if necessary.

According to US Navy Commander in Shanghai, General Crawford, the US Navy has been in close contact with the British naval authorities, and it is expected that Britain's protection measures will be the same as the US plan.

[United Press, Shanghai] US Western Pacific Fleet Commander Badger reiterated yesterday that the US military's deployment to Shanghai is not to participate in the Chinese civil war, but only to protect Americans and their businesses, and cannot replace the contribution of maintaining public order. Therefore, during the period when the situation is out of control, the only option is to relocate American citizens to the ships.

There are also no plans to prepare to evacuate personnel.

### Workers at Various China Textile Mills Request Four Months of Wages

Workers from various factories under the China Textile Company, upon hearing that the company had recently issued evacuation fees of four months' salary to each employee, yesterday dispatched representatives to the head office to demand the same four months of wages, but were unsuccessful. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to request mediation. Deputy Director Zhao then telegraphed Director Zhang and others from the company to try to mediate. The company representatives firmly denied that there was such a thing as evacuation fees. What the employees received included two months of pre-borrowed year-end bonuses, one month for autumn bonuses, and one month for attendance bonuses. Deputy Director Zhao believed that the company's actions would affect other industries, and that the workers' demands could not be considered unreasonable. It was then decided on two points: (1) Workers should send representatives to attend the company's bilateral affairs meeting this morning. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau should ask Mayor Wu for instructions on how to handle the matter. The workers may send representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau this afternoon to listen to the authorities' opinions.

### Equipment from China National Aviation Corporation Moves South, Employees Panic, Go On Hunger Strike to Protest

[Our Newspaper] Employees of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) at Longhua Airport, because the company authorities recently moved important equipment south to Hong Kong, and have not yet made clear statements regarding the disposition of employees, were panicked and staged a hunger strike in protest at noon yesterday. A reporter interviewed the person in charge of the company yesterday, who said that the relocation of important equipment south was due to the contraction of business in North China, and in order to seek development in the South China and Nanyang regions, a base was established in Hong Kong, so a portion of the equipment was moved south, but it was not to withdraw the general headquarters from Shanghai. He also said that observing the situation, it seemed there was no need to withdraw at all, so the employees' panic was self-inflicted. The company authorities have absolutely no decision to disperse and lay off employees.

### Witnessing Abuses in the Rush to Exchange Gold and Silver, Platoon Leader Angrily Questions Bank Staff; Some Propose Adopting a Rationing Method for Those from Organizations and Groups

[Our Newspaper] The order of gold and silver exchange in the city has not improved, and according to witnesses, the Central Bank has seen corruption. According to Wang Qing, a platoon leader of the 9th Regiment of the military police, and soldiers Hu Jinlong and others, who were dispatched to maintain order at the Central Bank on the Bund on Sanma Road yesterday: When the bank started issuing application forms yesterday morning, not only were the first and third (or fourth) application forms taken away by bank staff, but a bank employee, about 30 years old, wearing a yellowish-brown suit, ran over and asked the issuer for one. Those guarding the gate also failed to do their duty, and it was discovered that one person forcibly pulled their child inside to collect an application form. Or, temporary permission was granted to scalpers who had already exchanged gold and silver to change their identity cards. Incidents like these were endless. Therefore, at 11:00 AM, the bank announced that it would stop issuing application forms, saying that 107 application forms had been issued. At that time, the crowd waiting outside swarmed in, and the order was greatly disrupted, but at this time, those who were truly lining up only received the 97th application form. At that time, platoon leader Wang Qing, out of righteous indignation, questioned the issuing staff, asking why the 100th application form had not been issued, but it had been announced that application forms up to the 107th had been issued? At that time, the bank employee stared blankly and did not know how to respond, only saying: they were only responsible for issuing application forms and did not care about the numbers. The situation inside is very intriguing.

Observing the exchange situation in recent days, it is clear that there are many abuses. In addition to creating a group of professional scalpers and creating opportunities for a small number of people to get rich, law-abiding members of society have basically no opportunity to exchange. It is heard that some people advocate adopting a rationing method for the exchange of gold and silver for organizations and groups, in order to remedy the shortcomings of the current method.

### Limit of Ten Taels of Gold Per Exchange of Deposits

[Our Newspaper] Since the business of exchanging deposits for cash was changed to exchanging based on identity cards, the crowding situation has not improved. Also, there is no limit to the amount of gold that can be exchanged per application form, so when there are large exchange customers, the counting time is inevitably prolonged, affecting a large number of small exchange customers. In view of this, the Central Bank changed the method again yesterday, limiting each person to exchanging up to ten taels of gold each time, but not limiting the number of exchanges. The method for exchanging silver dollars remains the same. It is believed that after the change, gold can be supplied more widely than before, and the number of tokens issued can also be increased. The four banks of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank have all been operating according to the new method since yesterday.

Also, the Central Bank specifically announced yesterday that all those who hold application forms from the bank before the 9th must exchange them by the 9th.

### Crowds Also at Garrison Department

[Our Newspaper] Since it was stipulated that military and police personnel must first apply at the Garrison Headquarters before exchanging gold and silver, it has been two days now. Because only 200 application permits are issued each day, and the number of military personnel who go to apply is always more than six or seven hundred, the area in front of the Garrison Headquarters is extremely crowded. Garrison Commander Chen Daqing also stipulated that from today onwards, anyone applying to exchange more than five taels of gold must not only have an identity document of an active military member and prove its legitimate use, but must also be personally received by Commander Chen for an individual conversation before permission can be granted.

### Robbery at a Western-Style Clothing Store in Western Shanghai – Two Perpetrators Apprehended on the Spot

Accomplices Revealed to Be Soldiers

[Our Correspondent] Zhu Hongdeng, owner of Hongtai Western-Style Clothing Store at 736 Route Tenant de la Tour, Western Shanghai, reported that at approximately 9 PM the previous evening, four robbers suddenly appeared. Two of them were armed with guns. They herded the staff and apprentices onto the mezzanine, where one robber guarded them. The remaining robbers looted nine men's leather short coats, one Chinese-style black wool coat, two leopard-skin women's coats, one Chinese-style men's coat, and one cat-skin women's coat from the storefront display, totaling fourteen items, and fled with the stolen goods. At that time, the owner's wife, Zhu Chen, secretly slipped out the back door and telephoned the Jiangning Road Police Precinct to report the crime. Wang Xinheng, the Precinct Chief, immediately ordered Lin Deming, the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to lead Police Chief Hu Zhijie and police officers Zhang Yanxin, Wang Chenglong, Zhang Yulin, Yu Minglv, and others, to rush to the scene in patrol cars. They apprehended two robbers at the entrance and recovered the stolen goods. The other two robbers managed to escape. After interrogating the arrested robbers at the precinct, they identified themselves as Qian Yaotian and Zhang Daquan. They also revealed the names of their accomplices at large as Dai Jinsheng and Tang Zhiquan, both soldiers from a certain military organization.

### Extension of the Implementation Period for Regulations on Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses by One Year

### First Exciting Soccer Match of the Season – Qingbai Shows Championship Form – Demonstrates Strength and Defeats Dongxing

[Our Correspondent] In the friendly soccer match organized by the Municipal Sports Reporters Association, Qingbai and Dongxing met at Yiyuan yesterday. The two teams were evenly matched and of equal strength. In an extremely tense situation, Qingbai won by a valuable one goal, defeating Dongxing. The first half ended with a score of 0-0, with no records for either side. The intensity of the competition and the quality of the performance were unprecedented this season. The stands at Yiyuan were filled with over 8,000 fans, creating an unprecedented scene. The referee was Shen Huichun, with Chen Jixiang and He Chunhui as linesmen.

Qingbai's 1-0 victory over Dongxing fully demonstrated their championship form. Twenty minutes after the start of the match, Qingbai began to gain the upper hand, but repeated attacks yielded no results. The situation in the second half remained under Qingbai's control, and Gao Baozheng finally scored a goal, securing the victory. Dongxing's prolonged attacks failed to penetrate, and their morale gradually declined, making it impossible to salvage the situation. In terms of defensive strength, the two sides were evenly matched, with Yan Shixin and Meng Yiliang for Qingbai, and Wu Qixiang and Zheng Bingyi for Dongxing. However, in terms of the agility of the forwards, Qingbai's Xiao Luo, Afu, and Baozheng, with the exception of Fei Chunhua who was slightly less impressive, plus Jin Lusheng, whose movements were wonderful, Dongxing had to admit their inferiority. Dongxing had more courage than wisdom, and lacked the ability to score in front of the goal. If it were not for Wu Qixiang in the rear, the number of goals conceded would have been more than just one. Qingbai's relentless attacks in the first half failed to produce results. In the second half, Gao Baozheng was moved to the front line, greatly enhancing the attacking force, demonstrating that the formation at the time was greatly related to the victory.

The match started at 3 PM, with Dongxing taking the kickoff. The two sides were evenly matched, and Dongxing's momentum was strong, attacking repeatedly, but without success. After about 20 minutes, Qingbai gradually gained the upper hand, but due to Qixiang's obstruction, they could only sigh in vain, and remained in a bitter struggle for more than half an hour, still with a score of 0-0. After the break, the players returned to the field, and Gao Baozheng was reassigned to the forward line, while Liu Tiyin was sidelined. Just two minutes after the restart, Xiao Fei advanced rapidly along the sideline and sent a long pass to the front of the goal. Gao Baozhi received the pass, creating an excellent opportunity. A ball that could have been scored soared into the sky. Seven minutes later, Qingbai advanced again. Xiao Luo got the ball and advanced straight along the left sideline. Jin Lusheng turned to the center to support him. Shi Dafa and Li Chengxian were both spun past in one move, and advanced to the goal line, sending a quick pass to the center. Qu Yongfu laid the ball off in front of the goal, and Gao Baozheng, waiting in the right position, headed the ball into the net. The clarity of the ball's path and the beauty of the pass were greatly admired by the 8,000 spectators. Qingbai opened the scoring first, and a storm raged in front of Dongxing's goal. Jin Lusheng launched another lob, but unfortunately Qu Yongfu did not manage to head it in. Qingbai's offensive was sharp, but it did not succeed. As time was running out, Shi Dafa was tackled by Yan Shixin, and won a free kick 30 yards outside the goal. The ball was sent high to the front of the goal, and Zhang Jiliang took advantage of the situation to swing at the ball. The ball hit the goalpost and bounced down, but did not enter the net. The failure to score this goal shattered Dongxing's hopes, and the victory and defeat were also a matter of luck and misfortune. The silver whistle blew for a long time, and Qingbai triumphed with a score of 1-0.

### Procedures for Endorsing Foreign Exchange Asset Transfer Certificates Under Study – Majority Advocates for Phased System to Avoid Market Impact

Regarding the matter of issuing Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates for the foreign exchange assets owned by the people and deposited with the Central Bank, relevant agencies have been conducting in-depth studies in recent days. According to sources from the financial authorities, the basic principles of the measures have already been determined. Currently, various parties are studying the timing and method of issuing the transfer certificates. According to the opinions put forward by various relevant parties, it is generally advocated that a phased system should still be adopted for the issuance of these transfer certificates, in order to avoid large-scale issuance and affecting market prices. However, importers and commercial firms hold a skeptical attitude towards this. They believe that it is difficult to say whether this decision by the government can ensure that the original owners do not suffer losses. They are all focusing their attention on the development of the situation and the relaxation of import review standards, as they believe that these two aspects will directly determine the price of transfer certificates in the future.

### Cotton Yarn Fluctuates Upward, Fabric Market Optimistic About Price Increases

The opening prices of cotton yarn are generally stable and attractive, but the customer demand is still narrow. Sales to Guangdong and Taiwan are slightly better, but there is little procurement by the processing industry. As for the fact that public utilities have increased prices by about 100%, it is related to the cost of cotton yarn. Therefore, holders are reluctant to sell at lower prices, and prices are fluctuating upward.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 12,500 yuan, and although it once rose to 12,800 yuan, it finally closed at 12,600 yuan, a slight increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Other brands such as Baoguang and Jincheng also rose by 100 to 200 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 700 yuan, while 32-count Blue Phoenix and Yinyue each rose by 600 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at a high price of 11,000 yuan, and once fell to around 10,000 yuan, but finally closed at 10,400 yuan, a rise of 600 yuan. Also, the highest price for warehouse receipts approached the 10,000 yuan mark, and finally traded at 9,400 yuan, also up 400 yuan.

20-count Double Horse rose from 9,200 yuan to 9,500 yuan, a rise of 600 yuan. Other coarse yarns of 16 counts and below also showed slight improvements.

The fabric market is flourishing, and the momentum of various fabrics is still good. After the opening, the number of customers reaching out was very large, and the local market's ability to replenish stocks was also strong. Furthermore, it was heard that the price of cotton yarn had risen, boosting morale, and prices rose steadily, ultimately closing firmly.

Longtou fine cloth rose from 375 yuan to 390 yuan, an increase of 28 yuan compared to the previous day. Medium-grade fine cloths such as Wufu and Laba Tong both finally traded at 350 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Biji opened in the morning at 390 yuan, and during the session rose to a high of 414 yuan, before closing slightly back at 408 yuan, a rise of 23 yuan. Jinyun Miaowu Yuan Biji rose by 20 yuan. As for Leifengta Yuan Biji, it remained unchanged from the previous day's opening price of 380 yuan. Sijunzi Zhigong Qie rose to 420 yuan, with little change in the goods opened by dyeing and weaving factories.

China Textile Corporation Opens Yarn

China Textile Corporation opened nearly nine types of yarn yesterday. Due to the large amount of capital flowing to the gold market, the number of yarns sold was very small, with only 46 pieces sold. The audited prices were: 20-count Jinyuanbao (excluding tax) 7,000 yuan, 6-count Fu Riguang 2,800 yuan, 8-count Riguang 4,350 yuan, 15-count Shuiyue 5,700 yuan, 32-count Shuanggu Fengnian 12,000 yuan, 40-count Youhong Baoguang 9,900 yuan, 42-count Shuanggu Hong Liuma 11,800 yuan, 40-count Sangu Hong Baoguang 12,500 yuan, and 60-count Riguang 15,000 yuan.

### Silk Market Flat and Soft

Yesterday's artificial silk market showed a slight increase, but the trend was mediocre. The market intake and output were still scarce, and transactions were not active. 100-count Tianqiao opened at 9,500 yuan. In the middle, it was slightly soft and slightly firm. The market price rose and fell, and the market atmosphere was little turbulent. It closed at 9,600 yuan. After opening at 9,600 yuan, Dongyang was also due to the lack of actual sales, and retailers were waiting and watching, with no stimulation to morale. The market fluctuated for a long time, and then closed at 9,700 yuan, a rise of 100 yuan.

The export price of raw silk was unchanged yesterday. Foreign firms' purchases were small, and there were few transactions. Because the domestic sales price had not risen much in recent days, morale was good yesterday, and the market's buying interest turned stronger. The market price slowly rose. Grade 78 was traded at 13,000 yuan, an increase of 500 yuan. Excellent grade and ordinary grade also rose by 500 yuan.

The silk market continued to be weak yesterday, with more output than input in the market. The market trend was declining, and morale continued to be bearish. Both closing prices saw rises and falls. Huaqiang initially opened at 7,400 yuan, with average intake and output in the middle. Until the close, the performance was small at 200 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying interest turned slightly stronger, and customer sales showed slight intention to enter, with asking prices 300 yuan higher.

### Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Fall – Few Buyers

[Our Correspondent] The foreign exchange transfer certificate market rose in a straight line due to the Central Bank's entrustment of other national banks to purchase large quantities, reaching a high of 50 yuan. Later, due to the large supply from Taiwanese exporters, amounting to more than 3 million US dollars, the supply temporarily exceeded the demand, and the market fell. Yesterday morning, the price fell from 48 yuan to 46 yuan at noon, and there were few buyers. According to the opinions of exporters, they hope that the Central Bank will actively support when the transfer certificate market falls sharply.

In other news, the Import Control Committee reported: From the 2nd to the 8th of this month, import licenses issued for goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange that had been paid for totaled 68,725.55 US dollars and 10,400 Hong Kong dollars. Including the previous issues, the total amount is 540,642.41 US dollars and 15,180 Hong Kong dollars.

### Some Industrial Loans Applications Accepted

[Our Correspondent] The various preparatory works for industrial loans are now being actively carried out. The application forms for industrial loans were printed yesterday and applications have been accepted. The procedures stipulate that industry associations apply to the Central Bank, or that individual factories contact the commercial firms handling the loans. Application forms for order loans will be printed today and acceptance of applications can begin immediately.

### Credit Loosens, Cash Tightens

Yesterday's interbank lending rate in the city remained loose. The interbank overnight rate fluctuated between 20 yuan and 30 yuan per day, equivalent to 6 to 9 "jiao" per month, with most transactions closing at 7.5 "jiao." Both the supply and demand of funds were strong, but cash was still scarce. Firms in the industry also restricted withdrawals. Some limited withdrawals to 200 yuan. The reasons for this are said to be: (1) Cash is required to exchange for gold and silver. Those who exchange for gold and silver are trying to find cash, and after the Gold Yuan was withdrawn, cash became scarce. (2) Although the exchange rate in various places has fallen, Zhu Yiping and other traders are carrying large amounts of cash out of the country to seize the exchange rate, which is also a major reason for the shortage of cash.

### Amidst Falling Prices of All Goods, Export Materials Alone Rise

Recently, while the prices of all goods in this city have fallen, the prices of export materials have risen instead. Shanghai tung oil has jumped from 600 yuan per dan to 850 yuan. Hankou has risen to 600 yuan, and Wanxian in Chongqing has risen to 450 yuan to 500 yuan. As for pig bristles, Shanghai's 40-pack box has also risen to 17,000 yuan per dan. It is reported that yesterday's New York pig bristle market saw good reports on various types of Chinese pig bristles, and domestic selling prices are universally expected to rise. According to industry insiders, the reasons for the rise are: (1) Although exporters have been selling off goods for cash and heading to Taiwan and Guangzhou, it is ultimately more stable and reliable to directly export goods to Guangzhou. (2) Due to the current situation, merchants going to the production areas to purchase goods have become more infrequent, resulting in a shortage of goods in this city and a depletion of inventories. (3) The selling price of foreign exchange transfer certificates has risen, increasing export profits significantly, and exporters are competing to purchase them.

### Applications for Import Last Week Decreased by One-Third

According to the Import Control Committee, the number of applications for imports under the Central Bank's Foreign Currency Exchange Payment Measures last week (December 2 to 8) totaled 21, with a total amount of US$68,725.55 and HK$10,400, a decrease of one-third compared to the previous week's 30 applications, amounting to 92,768.67 yuan. Broken down by category, there were 9 applications for production equipment listed in Schedule 1, amounting to US$32,067.10 and HK$10,400; 6 applications for industrial raw materials listed in Schedule 2, amounting to US$17,896.80; and 18,761.65 US dollars for essential goods listed in Schedule 3A.

### Abundant Arrivals, Sluggish Sales: Rice Struggles to Recover, Flour Weakens, Cooking Oil Shows Strong Momentum

Rice arrivals yesterday continued to flood the market, with 8699 shi and 5 dou arriving in both cities, including 4635 shi and 5 dou in the Southern City market and 4064 shi in the Northern City market. Market conditions rose slightly. Locally produced rice previously rose by 20 yuan, but due to sluggish consumption, prices lacked the momentum to rise. As a result, all grades of rice in both the Northern and Southern cities rose slightly by 5 yuan. In the Southern City, Bai Jing rice was 355 yuan, Bo Dao rice was 350 yuan, early rice was 330 yuan, and Yang Xian rice was 362 yuan. In the Northern City, Bai Jing rice was 360 yuan, Bo Dao rice was 340 yuan, early rice was 325 yuan, Yang Xian rice was 350 yuan, and Bai Yuan rice was 360 yuan.

Flour

Flour turned weak, sales were sluggish, and market sentiment was slack, leading to a consistent slight decline in prices. Bing Chuan flour opened at 127 yuan, closed at 129 yuan, down 3 yuan. Lao Che flour opened at 139 yuan, closed at 137 yuan, also down 4 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands of flour all declined slightly by varying amounts of 3-4 yuan. Hong Feng flour was 126 yuan, Jian Cheng flour was 123 yuan, Di Qiu (Earth) flour was 130 yuan, and Deng Ta (Lighthouse) flour was 132 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Yesterday, arrivals of miscellaneous grains remained abundant, and sales were still brisk. Raw peanuts rose sharply, with Nanjing raw peanuts at 400 yuan, up 50 yuan from yesterday's market. Yangzhou raw peanuts approached the 600 yuan mark, trading at 570 yuan. Milk sesame continued to be strong, with Jiujiang milk sesame at 300 yuan, up another 3 yuan. Red sorghum also rose by 10 yuan, with Jiangyan red sorghum at 100 yuan. Yuan wheat and corn were flat, with supply and demand balanced. Local soybeans were purchased, leading to an upward trend in the market, with prices rising by more than 10 yuan. Hankou Za Dou beans were 155 yuan, and Pudong Du Dou beans were 195 yuan, up 10 yuan.

Cooking Oil

Cooking oil rose again, with very strong sales. Credit was easing in the industry, and prices rose across the board. Qingdao Ji Tong aged oil was 930 yuan, up 30 yuan. Jiangbei Ji Tong raw oil was 940 yuan, also up 30 yuan. The market for soybean oil from our own factory fluctuated, opening high at 890 yuan. The market then rose to 900 yuan, before falling back to 850 yuan, closing at 860 yuan, up slightly by 10 yuan from yesterday. Raw rapeseed oil was 770 yuan, opening at 760 yuan and closing up 60 yuan. Refined rapeseed oil rose by 30 yuan. Chongqing hot rapeseed oil was 620 yuan, and Ji Tong small cart oil was 920 yuan, up 20 yuan. Soybean cake rose slightly, with Chang Zi cake at 77 yuan, up 1.2 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Flat and Weak

The sugar market was weak. Holders were watching the market and reluctant to sell. Although sales to customers had not improved, local demand was slightly better, but the overall trend remained weak. Apart from No. 4 and No. 5 Che Bai (white sugar) which rose slightly by 2-3, most other grades fell.

### Mediocre Tea Exports

Yesterday, the tea market saw sellers eager to sell, springing up like bamboo shoots after rain, but export of boxed tea was limited by the mediocre demand from exporters, making it difficult to raise prices further, and sellers struggled to maintain current levels. As for domestically sold flavored teas, sales from local areas and elsewhere remained steady, and market sentiment gradually strengthened, especially for lower-grade rough teas, which were in high demand, making the situation particularly vibrant.

### Tung Oil Lingering

Yesterday, the tung oil market tended to fluctuate again. Since the actual demand from all parties has narrowed, the industry has experienced a decline in business, so sellers, although they tried to raise prices due to scarce arrivals and inventory, ultimately felt unable to continue to raise prices. By the close of the market, prices remained unchanged. Full-weight Bai You (white oil) was 640 yuan per dan, genuine brand Xi Hong was 580 yuan per barrel, and the rest remained at the same level.

### US Aid Equipment Allotments Determined

The Executive Yuan's US Aid Committee announced the allocations for the Industrial Replenishment Equipment Plan: (1) US$6 million for transportation and shipping replenishment equipment, (2) US$1 million for replenishment equipment for coal mines throughout the country, (3) US$500,000 for replenishment equipment for tin, tungsten, and antimony mines in central, southern, and southwestern China, and (4) US$5.25 million for other replenishment equipment, including public utilities and power companies. Those who were unable to apply for foreign exchange from the Transportation Control Commission in the past to purchase the necessary replenishment equipment can obtain some assistance here.

Allocation of Industrial Project Loans: 1. Coal Mines: Huainan Coal Mine in the Yangtze River Basin, US$3.5 million; Nanling Coal Mine in South China, US$750,000; various coal mines in central, southern, and Taiwan, US$750,000; Gaokeng Coal Mine in central and southern China, US$4 million.

2. Electricity: Shanghai Electric Power Company, US$5 million; Taiwan Electric Power Company, US$3.5 million (including the proposed Taiwan Fertilizer Company, US$1.5 million).

3. Fertilizer Plants: Taiwan Yimin Fertilizer Company, US$1.5 million (jointly operated by the National Resources Commission, the Bank of China, and Shenchang Foreign Firm); Taiwan Mulong Xinzhu Fertilizer Plant of the National Resources Commission, US$1 million; Nanjing Yongli Chemical Company, US$50,000.

4. Tin and Antimony Mines: Southwest, Central, and South China, US$2 million. The above-mentioned beneficiary units are now in the process of selecting and hiring design engineers to formulate plans, which will be reviewed and approved by the committee's consulting engineering company, White Company, before the Washington Economic Cooperation Administration can issue material purchase authorization.

### Commercial Briefs

Building materials are still in a downward trend, with bricks and tiles falling to the lowest possible price. Cement is still being sold off by small retailers, falling to 35 yuan per bag, and can be purchased for 30 yuan for larger quantities. Lime continues to fall by 10 yuan, opening at 70 yuan.

Due to frequent military transportation, lack of transportation vehicles has caused a large accumulation of inland shipments of feathers at the Nanjing Railway Station. As a result, exports here are still limited to previous inventories. Based on current new product prices, Tong Huo white feathers are 800 to 1000 yuan per Sima dan, and gray feathers are 700 to 800 yuan.

The timber market is sluggish. Yang Song (foreign pine) square logs sold to bridge builders are only 50 yuan per dan. Although the market price of Yang Song is still quoted at 3 yuan per foot, in reality, no one wants it even at 2.5 yuan.

The medicinal materials market is mostly flat and weak. New cargo Lou Pi (dried tangerine peel) from Haimen is quoted at 60 yuan. Good quality Yu Zhu (Solomon's Seal) is scarce. Guang Mu Xiang (radix Aucklandiae) and pepper have experienced reversals due to excessively large inverted port telegram prices. The Guang Bang (Guangdong merchant guild) is handling the situation, and market prices are gradually rising, returning to the market prices of the previous week.

### New Map of Refugees: A Quick Sketch of Winter Scenery in Hangzhou

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Chu Yusheng

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] Years of war, coupled with the tension of the current Bengbu-Suxian battle, have inevitably shocked even this quiet and peaceful paradise. It is the middle of winter, when tung trees are sparse and old, and the gentle West Lake has also become desolate.

This is the shock brought by Nanjing and Shanghai, and also the rumors brought by Nanjing and Shanghai. The city railway station, this transportation hub, is crowded to the point of chaos, and the chaos turns into turmoil. Most of the people coming from Nanjing and Shanghai want to transfer to Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou, and they try their best to take all their luggage. They consider themselves sixth-class refugees because first-class refugees fly to America, second-class go to Hong Kong, third-class go to Taiwan, fourth-class go to Guangzhou, fifth-class take boats to Taiwan or Guangzhou, and sixth-class take the land route to Guangzhou or inland. Since then, the people of Hangzhou have been watching batches of refugees and hearing pieces of "street news," which cannot but make people anxious.

Spreading Bedding in the Railway Station: Turning into a Temporary Dormitory

There are more and more refugees. Everyone wants to be comfortable, so they all want to take the sleeper cars on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. As a second-best choice, the reserved-seat first- and second-class cars are also fully packed. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is once again burdened with arduous tasks. It has just been repaired and is now encountering the second major disaster.

Later, someone rumored that you don't need a ticket to get on the trains in Nanjing and Shanghai, as long as you can squeeze in. Therefore, the passengers on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also boldly tried. As a result, trains are running irregularly, departing as soon as they arrive. It is a pity that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway had hoped to recover after the repairs, but that hope has now vanished.

There are not many train cars and the train frequency of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is also not high. As a result, many refugees spontaneously spread their bedding on the station, turning it into a temporary dormitory. Some people use their suitcases to form a boundary, some use ropes to create a boundary, and some even light stoves in the corners to cook meals.

Wandering Until Which Year? Fleeing to Where?

Many people think like this: "When the Yuan Dynasty invaded, Jiangnan was well-off for many years. It took a lot of effort to fight Nanjing in the Qing Dynasty, and Hangzhou is not a strategic location, so it is possible to stay here for a while." Under this idea, quite a few people have moved to Hangzhou to stay. However, people in Hangzhou have another idea: "Although Hangzhou is not a strategic location, it is still scary, so it is better to run to Shanghai, or to Jiangxi or inland." Under this idea, the number of Hangzhou residents fleeing to Shanghai and other inland areas is also gradually increasing.

Recently, some people have fled from Jiujiang and Nanchang in Jiangxi to Hangzhou, and they feel that it is not safe there either. Safety, safety, where is safe after all? It is truly "wandering until which year? fleeing to where!"

One Mu of Land on Yingshi Street: Demanding Fifteen Gold Bars

According to people from Nanjing and Shanghai, "Houses, land prices, and everything else in Nanjing are particularly cheap." However, Hangzhou does not have this phenomenon, and instead seems to be more expensive. One mu of land on Yingshi Street demands fifteen gold bars, and a small house also requires a key money payment (ding fei). The monthly rent is one shi of white rice. Various stores do not display cheap price signs but are instead 10-20% more expensive than in Shanghai. For example, ordinary velvet yarn sells for only 120 yuan per pound in Shanghai, but in Hangzhou, it sells for 160 yuan per pound.

Hotels and Teahouses Full: Singing Girls and Divine Maidens Popular

Hotels in Hangzhou have once again announced that they are full, with luggage piled up to the rafters. Several hotels on the lakefront can no longer accommodate any more guests, let alone the city railway station. Even teahouses have become temporary residences. However, several hotels in the inner West Lake, such as Xiling, Xin Xin, and Dielai, are not doing so well because today's travelers are not looking for any "pleasing and enjoyable things" but are here to flee. They want to be as close as possible to transportation hubs. In order to restore order to the station, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has designated passengers going to Shanghai to board at Changshanmen and passengers going to Jiangxi to board at Nanxingqiao. From now on, Nanxingqiao will again be a medium-sized refugee picture.

In Hangzhou, cafes are becoming popular again. In the cafes, singing girls are singing decadent songs. "Sitting with an orange" costs hundreds of yuan at a time, and no one cares. Gambling has also been discovered. The "Nightingales" (divine maidens) on Yingshi Street also have patrons, and they no longer have to stand in the cold wind and rain like before.

Groups of Refugee Students: Seeking Food and Lodging in Hangzhou

Another scene is the refugee students. They come in groups of hundreds and thousands, and some haven't had food for several days. They came to Hangzhou thinking they could settle down, but they didn't know that the Hangzhou station was also chaotic. They have left their families and relatives and come to a foreign land, and their mood is quite bad, so many actions are inadvertently revealed. The Hangzhou Municipal Government is ultimately responsible for solving their food and lodging problems, but batches of refugee students leave and new ones keep coming, truly "wandering until which year? fleeing to where!"

### Military Instructor in Changzhou, Jiang Kewen, Shot While Collecting Rent

Taken to Hospital, Life Extremely Endangered

[This Newspaper, Wujin, 7th] Jiang Kewen, a military instructor in the Xiaxi District of the county, abandoned his duties and led armed guards to the Maojiaqiao area of Lijiaqiao in the Qianhuang District to collect rent for Mao Huangen, a wealthy landlord with two to three hundred mu of fertile land. The Mao family is wealthy and used to run factories in Shanghai. Over the years, they entrusted Jiang Kewen with rent collection. His methods were cruel, refusing to implement the "25% rent reduction" and even using old scales to weigh grain, profiting from the difference. As a result, he had deep grudges. At 10:00 AM on the 7th, while passing through the junction area of Maojiaqiao and Wuxi, seven or eight thugs suddenly sprang out from the roadside bushes, blocked the road, and ordered Jiang to kneel down. Then, three or four shots were fired, and Jiang fell to the ground. One of the guards, "One-Eyed Dragon," was shot and killed on the spot. The thugs escaped immediately. Jiang was not dead yet and was taken to Wujin Hospital for treatment, but his life is in extreme danger.

### Two Strangulation Murders in Changshu: Suspects Handed Over to District Prosecutor's Office

According to reports: According to the small bamboo worker who lived with Zhu Zhou, at 8:00 PM when the murder happened, Shan Gengsheng shined a flashlight, indicating that Shan was the main culprit.
