### Zhu Jiahua's Speech

Explanation on the Pro-American, Pro-Japanese Issue

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th Dispatch] The dispute caused by some students over the pro-American, pro-Japanese issue has somewhat subsided. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua specially issued a statement, which stated in brief: "I believe that the occurrence of anti-American, pro-Japanese sentiments is, apart from those with ulterior motives exploiting the issue to achieve anti-government goals, mostly a reflection of a psychological factor. American personnel should be able to understand this psychological factor. The Japanese government and public should also be aware of it. I further hope that when the American representatives of the Allied nations enable Japan to achieve economic self-sufficiency, they will also pay attention to the construction of a peaceful mentality among the Japanese people. When Japan is 'learning democracy,' it must thoroughly eliminate the past aggressive toxins. As for our understanding of the current situation in Japan and the implementation of the Allied nations' policy towards Japan, it seems that it is not yet clear enough, and we should conduct more research to understand the truth."

Editorial

### Special Relief Levy and Property Tax

Since the special relief levy took concrete form, the property tax issue had virtually disappeared, because after several transformations during the preparation period, it finally came down to the so-called special levy, which was originally an incarnation of the property tax.

Due to Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu's exploratory policy, he again focused on this tax source, and some members of the Legislative Yuan also proposed its implementation, believing that it was a bloodless economic revolution to balance social wealth. Thus, this issue has once again aroused heated discussions in various quarters.

Regardless of the proposers' motives, it is a generally recognized fact that the current financial revenue is less than expenditure and that inflation is too severe. Therefore, it is almost a unanimous demand to open up another source of revenue, increase tax revenue to strive for a balanced budget, and at the same time avoid the continued expansion of inflation. However, now that constitutionalism has just begun, government affairs are open, and the people have the obligation to pay taxes, and at the same time, through the parliament, they also have the right to review finances. What is the actual situation of the country's expenditures now? How much legal tender is being issued monthly? Is there still room for increasing existing revenues? What are the wasteful expenditures that can be saved, and what other revenues can be injected? It seems that the Minister of Finance should first accurately announce this detailed account so that everyone can see and hear it together and understand the crux of the matter. Only if revenue and expenditure are appropriate and it is indeed necessary to raise additional compensation, then it is acceptable to start a property tax or raise other revenues. This is the normal course of a constitutional country, and we are not deliberately striking a high note.

We also know very well that there is a national budget now, and the budget for the second half of the 37th year is still being prepared by the Ministry of Finance, so all revenue and expenditure figures should of course be accounted for first. However, what we are asking for are accurate figures for each item and the actual financial situation, not a superficial outline, nor a conclusion that is barely pieced together on paper, and even less a vague, ambiguous, and perfunctory set of numbers. Considering the official documents on financial matters in past years and the failure to announce the number of issues on time, we believe that this minimum requirement is very reasonable and very essential, and the new Minister of Finance does not seem to be able to ignore it.

As for balancing wealth, its intention lies in the wealthy and powerful and those who take advantage of opportunities to seize windfall profits. This is the unanimous public opinion at the moment, and no one will deliberately defend them. But the real question is: When the property tax is levied, will the targets go awry? In other words, is it possible for the truly wealthy and powerful and those who have made a fortune from windfall profits to evade it? Will this burden still fall on the general middle and lower classes? Consider the deposits of Chinese people fleeing overseas, which have been enthusiastically demanded by various parties for several years, but so far the authorities have been helpless. Also, the heavy burden of the special relief levy seems to still require the guilds to painstakingly apportion it. It can be seen that our overthinking is not without basis.

As everyone knows, due to the long-term war of resistance and the result of currency inflation, the general middle and lower classes are already overwhelmed and can no longer withstand excessive exploitation, and industry and commerce are also struggling desperately and are collapsing under the heavy burden of various levies and forms of apportionment. The melon of Huangtai is indeed unbearable to be picked again. Therefore, if this property tax is determined to be levied, then the targets of its levy must be clearly stipulated in accordance with the original plan. The sole reason for increasing revenue must not be used as an excuse to arbitrarily extend the scope of the levy. It must be known that the wealthy and powerful and those who have made windfall profits are not very extensive in scope. Apart from these people, the vast majority of the people are struggling on the starvation line. Their limited wealth does not need to be redistributed, and if the result of redistribution further accelerates their decline, it will not make a substantial contribution to supplementing the national treasury. This is what the authorities must pay close attention to when planning the property tax.

As mentioned above, the special relief levy is a variant of the property tax. If Minister Wang is indeed determined to implement the property tax, then whether the special relief levy should continue to be implemented in accordance with the original plan is worthy of further consideration. Two taxes on one item, or duplicate levies, are not permissible in theory. Or, if there is a name, a tax can be levied. In the process of the property tax transforming into a special relief levy, there are also names such as property donation, temporary property tax, and national construction special donation. Is it possible now or in the future to successively stage several more levies under some kind of name? Observing the psychology of the people, all those who support the implementation of the property tax are advocating that those with money should contribute money, and the targets are none other than the wealthy and powerful and those who have made windfall profits. The reason is none other than to balance social wealth. It can be seen that if this goal can be achieved, then once is enough, and there is no need to repeat it. Otherwise, building houses on top of each other and repeatedly levying taxes will still be irrelevant to the original purpose, and will instead appear to be harassing! Therefore, we advocate that the name of the special relief levy may be revised, and its content may only be strengthened and enriched, but it should not compete with the property tax, resulting in a phenomenon of one tax being levied twice. Fortunately, after several months, the so-called special relief levy has in fact hardly been implemented, and it is not too late to revise it in time.

### North China Industrial and Mining Base: Tangshan Radiates Light and Heat

[Our Tangshan Bureau, 5th Dispatch] The industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast are collapsing one by one, and the trains with huge transport capacity are mostly out of breath. Coming out of such an environment, sitting on the express train on the Jin-Yu section, galloping on the eastern Hebei Plain, and then looking at the industrial and mining enterprises emitting smoke and steam in the section from Guye to Tangshan, most people have feelings of both joy and sorrow.

Today, everyone's attention has shifted to Tangshan, the industrial and mining center of North China. The Communists also have great ambitions for Tangshan. The first step seems to be to shrink the encirclement and isolate Tangshan, but they have not been able to achieve their wishes. Now, all they can do is to constantly damage the railways east and west of Tangshan. However, due to the rapid repairs by the railway workers, trains are still coming and going as usual.

Slow Southward Relocation is Uncertain

The authorities naturally attach great importance to this place. People in the north are very afraid that the authorities' attention is not enthusiastic enough, so everyone is paying close attention to the actions of all parties. In May, the National Resources Commission (NRC) planned to transport a six-ton electric furnace and two four-ton converters that were not currently in use at the Tangshan Steel Plant to Daye for installation, and packed some other parts into boxes. The workers in the steel plant were the first to panic, followed by the social community who responded. They believed that although this was not an active relocation to the south, it was a manifestation of a slow southward relocation. The northern newspapers published the news in large characters, and the NRC hurriedly issued a statement, stating that there was no intention to relocate the Tangshan Steel Plant to the south.

The Tangshan Steel Plant was originally built by the Japanese. It is located in the northeast corner of Tangshan City, with two six-ton electric furnaces, four four-ton converters, as well as rolling mills and casting machines. It produces steel ingots, steel pipes, steel wheels, and steel saws, among other products. It currently has more than 600 employees. The NRC stated that the Tangshan plant is currently only operating one six-ton electric furnace, and its products are sufficient for the use of Tangshan and nearby factories. Therefore, it plans to dismantle the unused machines from the plant and transfer them to other plants in central China. The workers stated that those machines are spare parts, not unused parts, resulting in a stalemate.

Kailuan is Full of Vitality

The Kailuan Coal Mine has long been famous everywhere. This is a business jointly run by the British Kailuan Mining Company and the Chinese Zhengzhou Mining Company. The General Bureau of Mine Affairs is located in Tianjin, and the Mine Affairs Management Office is located in Tangshan. The Tangshan coal mine is located in the city center. From a distance, you can see two large cranes standing and turning rapidly, one powered by steam and the other by electricity. They use great force to lift coal from the depths of the coal mine to the ground. In the workshop above the well, the coal-loaded iron cars lifted from the bottom of the well are pulled out and pushed in in three layers, rumbling and full of vitality.

The Tangshan coal mine is the oldest one in the Kailuan Coal Mine, with a depth of 2,100 feet. It produces about 3,000 tons of coal per day, mostly supplied to Kailuan itself and the "Hebei Electric Power Company," "Qixin Cement Company," railways, and other large factories in Tangshan.

Three Centers of Coal Production

The Kailuan coal production centers are located in Zhaogezhuang, Linxi, and Tangjiazhuang in Guye. Zhaogezhuang produces more than 5,000 tons of coal per day, while Linxi and Tangjiazhuang produce more than 3,000 tons of coal per day. Most of it is transported and sold to other places. In total, the four mines have a coal production volume of about 400,000 tons per month.

Today, Kailuan's coal is supplying a large amount of power to factories and railway transportation in North China, western Liaoning, Shanghai, and even the southeast Guangzhou, and it is also promoting the navigation of coastal ships and the burning of the people, making a real contribution.

Qixin Cement Company

This company is also located in the city center of Tangshan. The huge chimney emits a large amount of smoke and steam. Its own mechanical factory faces it from afar. Currently, the cement production is about 15,000 tons per month, supplying all directions far and near. Huaxin Textile Factory, is the east neighbor of the Qixin Machinery Factory, it has more than 31,000 spindles, and more than 500 weaving machines, yarn and cloth production is also a lot.

The Tangshan Machine Factory owned by the railway stands next to the station, black smoke rises, and the sound is deafening, you can know that this old factory is still shouldering heavy work.

The Tangshan Power Plant, in the north of the city, can generate more than 10,000 kilowatts of power per day. There is also a power plant in Linxi, which can also generate 14,000 to 15,000 kilowatts of power. The two plants respectively supply power to industrial and mining enterprises and nearby areas.

Paper Mill and Porcelain Factory

Guanghua Paper Mill and Desheng Porcelain Factory are two famous industries in Tangshan. Unfortunately, due to poor sales, they are both maintaining a precarious situation. In addition, there are more than 100 large and small processing factories, all operated by merchants and mostly doing odd jobs for steel mills.

Tangshan has 200,000 Residents

Tangshan residents are said to number 200,000, but in reality, there are more than 160,000, while the remaining mobile population is 30,000 to 40,000. The highest institution of learning is Jiaotong University Tangshan Institute of Technology. Tangshan City has eight middle schools and sixty-three primary schools, with more than 4,000 middle school students and more than 17,000 primary school students. The city government is making great efforts to promote education.

Tangshan, is the North China industrial and mining base, a train after train of black and oily coal tons will be moved to here, transported to all directions, the industry is also surging and active, Tangshan is radiating light and heat!

### Director of the Sichuan Health Department, Dong Bingqi, Meets Yang Mei and Issues a Statement

[Our Chongqing Bureau, 9th Dispatch] Dong Bingqi, a famous doctor from Chengdu and Director of the Sichuan Health Department, met Yang Mei on the 8th and told reporters today: (1) Yang Mei does not eat, which is indeed true and is an unprecedented miracle in the scientific community. There is no such theoretical record in Chinese and foreign history, so it is impossible to issue any explanation. (2) Yang Mei does not eat and has no intentions, and is even ashamed of why she does not eat. Scientists should cherish facts and eliminate doubts after others have observed and confirmed them. He does not agree with the statement made by Li Zong'en, President of Peking Union Medical College, on the 7th, because this is equivalent to insulting the personality of Director Li Zhiyu. Yang Mei has not been examined by any medical personnel since arriving in Chongqing. He personally saw Yang Mei's thin bones, small breasts, ribs protruding from her chest, and an empty cavity in her back and abdomen, like a solid rubber ball. There were still five peanuts hidden in Yang Mei's arms, and a nurse said that Yang Mei had farted.

(3) The examination of Yang Mei should be handled by a physiology expert together with a pathology expert. Qi Zidao, President of Huaxi Medical College, a physiology expert in Sichuan Province who has a deep understanding of this, is familiar with medical administration, and this is also not his forte. After he goes to the capital, in addition to reporting the details to the Ministry of Health, he will discuss the matter with Lin Kesheng, a physiology expert who is famous internationally for his gastroenterology, the Director of the Army Medical Department, and Cai Qiao, the Acting Dean of the Medical College of the Central University, who was invited to lecture in England. Because there is no precedent for this matter, a detailed plan must be formulated. He believes that Lin Kesheng, Cai Qiao, and others will be willing to take on the examination after his explanation.

Dong also mentioned that in order to solve the mystery of not eating, several college students in the United States have recently fasted to provide research, but after starving for six or seven days, they were very uncomfortable and could not support themselves. Yang Mei has confirmed that she does not eat and has no reaction. Currently, in principle, her life should not be changed and people should continue to be sent to confirm it. After the cause of not eating is solved, in-depth research can be carried out to see if it can be applied to other ordinary people, changing from three meals to one meal, or even not eating. When he returned to his residence from Jiulongpo, Zhang Qun inquired in detail about Yang Mei's affairs and also felt it was important. Yang Sen also intends to contact the central government to allocate huge sums of money to set up a research institution. (Special correspondent Ouyang Chun)

(2) During the truce period, the mediator will use his judgment to determine whether the number of immigrants of military age is so large that allowing them to enter would give one side a military advantage. Those of military age allowed to enter within a limited number should be supervised during the truce and not be mobilized or given military training. (3) To the greatest extent possible, the mediator will inspect all immigrants at the port of embarkation and station UN observers on ships carrying immigrants. (4) During the first week of the truce, while all controls are still being prepared, the mediator should use his judgment to monitor the entry of any immigrants, regardless of age or gender. (5) The movement of troops and weapons from one relevant country to another, or near the Palestinian border or near the Palestinian battle lines, should be prohibited during the truce. (6) During the truce, all battle lines should remain fixed, and the combat forces deployed on each line, as well as all weapons on hand, should not be increased. Routine personnel replacements may be allowed. (7) Weapons should not be imported into the territory of any relevant country. (8) Relief work for the civilian populations of urban areas that have suffered significant losses in the conflict, such as Jerusalem and Jaffa, should be handled by an International Red Cross committee, but it must be ensured that the necessary supplies remaining at the end of the truce are not significantly greater or less than at the beginning of the truce.

This is because they have learned from the Soviet Union's recent currency reform that bank depositors are better off than those holding cash.

### US Senate Amends Conscription Law - Allows Recruitment of Foreign Soldiers - Total of 25,000 to Be Assigned to Domestic and Foreign Service - Eligible for US Citizenship After Five Years

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th Dispatch] The US Senate today passed an amendment by a vote of 43 to 33, authorizing the Secretary of War to allow the recruitment of foreign volunteers into the US Army. Volunteers should be between 18 and 35 years old. The total number should not exceed 25,000. The amendment was proposed by Senator Lodge and passed after a short discussion. Volunteers will form a foreign legion and be assigned to various branches of the US Army. After completing five years of service, they will be eligible to become US citizens. This foreign force will be used in Alaska, the Far East, and the Caribbean.

[United Press, Washington, 8th Dispatch] Republican Senator Gurney, Chairman of the Senate Military Committee, said, "Many people believe that this move is because Americans are unwilling to enlist and defend the country." Democratic Senator Holland said, "The United States will be accused by propagandists of using mercenaries." The original proposer, Lodge, said that these people do not constitute a "foreign legion" and are only scattered in various armies. For every foreign soldier who enlists, one less American soldier will be conscripted. He believes that countless anti-communist Poles, Czechs, and other nationals will enthusiastically join the US military. Lodge originally intended to recruit 50,000 foreign soldiers to serve only abroad. Today, it was decided to allow them to serve at home and abroad. The Senate will meet tonight to try to complete the conscription bill, deciding that peacetime conscription will be for a period of two years, which was originally stipulated as five years.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th Dispatch] The Senate has overturned the recommendation of its Military Committee, reducing the conscription service period from five years to two years.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] The passage of the amended draft law by the US Senate has been generally welcomed here.

### Military Aid to Western Europe Bill

### House Cuts Foreign Aid Bill Funding - Vandenberg Strongly Opposes - Advocates Restoring Original Amount to Implement Foreign Missions

[United Press, Washington, 9th Dispatch] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, presented his views to the Appropriations Committee today on the issue of allocating funds for foreign aid. He stated that the House's reduction of foreign aid funding was a rash and dangerous decision that would undermine the entire plan. In fact, Congress decided this morning to engage in European economic recovery aid, but the House is now refusing to allocate funds to support the policy. A policy established by Congress should not be rejected in this way, causing it to suffer a reputation for fickleness in the eyes of the world.

### Reciprocal Trade Act Extended for One Year

Passed by US Senate Finance Committee

[Reuters, Washington, 8th Dispatch] The Senate Finance Committee passed the bill to extend the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act for one year by a vote of eight to five. However, the attached amendment is broader than the bill passed by the House. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act will expire on the 14th of this month. President Truman requested that Congress approve its extension for three years. The bill under review in the Senate allows the Tariff Commission to recommend tariff limits. The President is not required to comply with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, but must provide reasons for non-compliance within 30 days.

### US Establishes University - Specializing in Research on Atomic Functions

[United Press, Brookhaven, New York, 9th Dispatch] The first new type of university in the atomic age is scheduled to open here this summer, training students to engage in peacetime research on atomic energy and becoming a center for scientific work in the northeastern United States. The school is named the National Brookhaven Laboratory and was founded by the University Association, an organization of nine eastern universities. The funding is requested from the government by the Atomic Energy Commission. This kind of connection between the government and the scientific community is the result of wartime cooperation between the two sides. The most important atomic energy research requires giant machines to be effective, which requires huge sums of money that private organizations cannot afford, so its establishment is necessary. In addition to manufacturing atoms and cosmic rays, it will also use atomic chain systems and radioactive materials to study deformation.

Beneficial to Mankind

The purpose is not only to increase mankind's ability to overcome disease and adapt to material life, but also to clarify mankind's fear of war. However, there are no military plans. The school is divided into five departments: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, and Engineering. The first three departments have already started work, and an animal house and greenhouse are under construction. The medical department is affiliated with a small hospital for the purpose of studying medical problems of atomic energy. The director of the school is Dr. Moss, under whom there are about 400 scientists and more than 1,000 technicians. Research reports will be published in various commissioned publications.

### International Agricultural Conference Opens - China Elected Vice Chairman

### US Atomic Energy Commission Funding Cut - Military Work Unaffected - Atomic Powered Airplanes and Ships Under Research

[Reuters, Washington, 8th Dispatch] The House Appropriations Committee recently decided to cut nearly one-tenth of the total funding of 550 million yuan proposed by the President for the US Atomic Energy Commission in the next fiscal year starting on July 1, totaling 48.15 million yuan. The total amount after the cut is 501.85 million yuan, which is 336.85 million yuan more than the US Atomic Energy Commission's funding for the previous year. Although the Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the recommendations of the Atomic Energy Commission, it stipulated that the cost of the military atomic program should not be reduced.

[United Press, Washington, 8th Dispatch] Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lilienthal told Congress on the 8th that the production of uranium-235, a necessity for making atomic bombs, has increased in the middle of last year, and the unit cost has also fallen. Lilienthal also said in the House Appropriations Committee that the US Air Force and Navy are studying atomic-powered airplanes and ships, which could cause huge changes in the military, greater than any invention in the last war. Xue also warned that due to the results of the atomic test on Itok Island, although not yet announced, the Atomic Energy Commission may request more money from Congress again. Lilienthal also said that continuous research is the only way to continue to maintain atomic military superiority. Economic atomic power for general use will take at least ten years or more to succeed.

### New Czech Constitution - Effective Yesterday

Benes Resigns for Refusing to Sign

[United Press, Prague, 8th Dispatch] The Czech government announced tonight that the new constitution came into effect today, but did not specify who signed it. It is generally believed that Prime Minister Gottwald signed it with the authorization of the cabinet. Former President Benes resigned because he was unwilling to sign it.

[Reuters, London, 9th Dispatch] Reliable sources in Prague reported that Gottwald will soon succeed as president, and Sabototsky, the labor movement leader who served as deputy prime minister, is expected to succeed as prime minister.

### Spellman Visits Japanese Emperor - News Reporters Barred

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] MacArthur Headquarters took extraordinary measures today to ensure the confidentiality of the Japanese Emperor, prohibiting Allied photographers and reporters from entering the palace gates to cover the news of the Japanese Emperor's meeting with New York Archbishop Spellman. MacArthur sent a trusted aide to meet with Hirohito last night to solicit his opinion, which led to this decision. However, four Japanese photographers were still allowed to enter the palace as usual.

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] Spellman visited the Japanese Emperor with Catholic teachers today. After leaving the palace, he told a press conference that he was very interested in the fact that the Japanese imperial family was considering converting to Catholicism, but he did not mention this during his audience with the Japanese Emperor. He will leave here by plane on the morning of the 10th, via Hawaii, to return to the United States, ending his 50-day, 40,000-mile tour of the cities of the Far East.

### USSR Reduces Troops in North Korea

[Reuters, Seoul, 9th Dispatch] Political observers believe that the Soviet Union's reduction of troops is intended to embarrass the United States. They also pointed out that the Soviet Union would not have bought it to reduce its troops without believing that the North Korean Communists had the confidence to control North Korea.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 9th Dispatch] The strength of the Soviet troops in North Korea is not yet accurately reported, but military observers believe that the Soviet troops in North Korea must be more numerous than the US troops in South Korea. According to an official report a month ago, there were 18,000 US troops in South Korea. Political observers here believe that the Soviet Union's statement is true because the Soviet troop reduction does not affect its military advantage. The Soviet Union can reinforce North Korea when it deems it necessary, and North Korea, which is under its control, is now protected by the People's Army.

### Japan to Send Merchant Fleet - to Persian Gulf to Load Oil

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] Japan is about to send its first postwar merchant fleet to the Persian Gulf to load oil.

### Human Rights Commission Passes - Freedom of the Press Amendment

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th Dispatch] The UN Human Rights Commission passed an amendment to the draft Declaration of Human Rights on the 8th, adding a clause on freedom of the press and speech. Although the Soviet Union protested, saying that this clause seemed to be specifically designed for the special interests of "spies," it was still ineffective. The committee overturned, by a vote of 12 to 4, two Soviet attempts to restrict the clauses on freedom of the press and speech adopted by the UN Conference on Freedom of the Press in Geneva in April.

### Southern State Proposes

Former Italian Territory Should Still Be Placed Under Italian Trusteeship

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 8th Dispatch] Yugoslavia today submitted a note to the Four Power Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference, proposing that most of the former Italian colonies should be placed under Italian trusteeship.

Eliminating these relationships would allow countries with stronger economies to encroach on Italy's interests and threaten Italy's economic and national independence.

### Five Major Charges Verified, Liu Deming Arrested Awaiting Interrogation, Six Agencies Jointly Seal Military Friendship Society and Other Locations

[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Deming, the president of the city's "Military Friendship Society" and deputy director of the Committee for Comforting Soldiers on Expedition, was recently secretly accused to the Ministry of National Defense of five major charges. The Songhu Garrison Command, upon receiving orders, investigated and verified the accusations. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, Commander Xuan ordered Senior Advisor Chongwei, Section Chief Zhang Yuren from the Guan Guan Chu, Section Chief Xu Shigao from the Military Law Office, Military Judge Mu Yan, and other personnel from various agencies including Inspector Zeng from the Port Command, Section Chief Zhang Kaiqiu, Chief of Staff Zhu Yangru from the Wusong Fortress Command, a representative from the Garrison District, Battalion Commander Shu Basuo from the 9th Gendarmerie Regiment, and Section Chief Chen from the Shanghai Supply Bureau, to proceed to locations such as the "Military Friendship Society" and "Military Friendship Salon." The 2nd Squad of the Garrison Brigade and the Gendarmerie Regiment were responsible for carrying out the sealing, and taking charge of guarding the premises. Currently, the front and rear doors of these units have been sealed, with only the side door allowed for entry and exit, but no items may be carried. All equipment and assets will be inventoried by the principal, and personnel from various agencies will jointly verify the inventory. A roster of internal service personnel will also be created, listing their age, position, and duties, and they will remain stationed as usual. At 9:00 AM today, each agency will send three representatives to gather at the 1st Section of the Adjutant's Office of the Garrison Command to re-verify all the assets of the "Military Friendship Society." The Military Glory Elementary School, the Military Friendship Radio Station, and the small newspaper affiliated with the society will be temporarily allowed to maintain their original status, continue classes, broadcast, and publish, pending further handling. Liu Deming himself was lured out of his bedroom by Yan Zi, the leader of the 2nd Squad of the Garrison Brigade, who falsely claimed to be discussing business. After showing an arrest warrant, he was arrested. At the time of his arrest, Liu was only wearing gray slacks. A servant then retrieved his upper garment, and Liu instructed an employee of the society to inform his wife to go to Nanjing quickly. After finishing his words, he was escorted into the Garrison Command vehicle and taken away. He is currently being held at the Garrison Command Military Law Office Detention Center, awaiting interrogation.

The Scene When the Military Friendship Society Was Sealed

### A Glimpse of the Accusations

It is reported that the most prominent of the accusations against Liu Deming include: (1) Illegally receiving enemy property, establishing dance halls and restaurants in the name of the Military Friendship Society, and occupying enemy-controlled buildings such as the "Military Friendship Salon" at 168 Haining Road and the "Military Friendship Restaurant" near the Minguang Theater. (2) Impersonating a high-ranking military officer. Since the victory, he has attended public and private banquets wearing a major general's uniform, and his business cards also list the rank of major general. After the establishment of the "Military Friendship Society," he presented it as a "military agency" to the outside world. From March 1935, he set up a guardhouse at the entrance and often managed to transfer several soldiers from the army to guard it for him. (3) Since assuming the position of deputy director of the Shanghai All-Circles Committee for Comforting Soldiers on Expedition, he has been in charge of all matters related to meal provisions. In the autumn of 1936, he received 3 billion in public funds from the committee, which he used to generate interest and profits.

[Another Report] Liu originally planned to hold a press conference at the Military Friendship Society at 4:00 PM today, but he was unexpectedly arrested last night, which was beyond his expectations.

### Plot to Sabotage Power Plant, Fugitive Principal Arrested, Zhao Jingen Sent to Garrison Command Military Law Office for Interrogation

[Report from Our Newspaper] In March, at the Yangshupu Power Plant, a hidden agent of the bandits placed iron filings into the machine's axle. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and a major disaster was averted. After the perpetrator was arrested by the Garrison Command, he was sent to the Special Criminal Court for trial. Recently, the Garrison Brigade obtained new clues and discovered that Zhao Jingen, the runaway principal offender in the case and a foreman at the Yangshupu Power Plant, was hiding at No. 5 Lanyu Lane in Yangshupu. The 2nd Squad leader led several officers to his address at midnight the other day, arrested him, and took him in for interrogation. According to his confession, he is from Pudong, 36 years old, and was introduced to the Communist Party in 1931 by someone nicknamed Shen Da Kua Tou. He confessed to all aspects of the conspiracy to sabotage the power plant. According to the squad's report, the suspect was escorted to the Investigation Office yesterday morning and then transferred to the Garrison Command Military Law Office for interrogation.

### "Reporter" Arrested in Student Unrest is Expelled Student from Two Schools

Ten Suspects Are Still Under Interrogation

The City Police Bureau announced yesterday that on the 5th of this month, some college and middle school students in the city, using the excuse of "opposing the United States' support of Japan," gathered at the Bund Park to march. The bureau arrested 54 suspects. Except for 44 suspects with minor involvement who were released on bail, among the remaining ten suspects in custody, one named Qian Wei, female, 21 years old, from Jiangsu, was also arrested among the students and brought to the bureau. She claimed to be Qian Weizhu, a reporter from the city's Free Forum newspaper, and presented badge number 103 from the newspaper to prove her identity. The bureau contacted the newspaper, which stated that Qian was not a formal reporter for the newspaper, and badge number 103 belonged to an employee named Chen Lu Zhi. After investigation by the bureau, Qian Wei is Qian Weizhu, who was previously expelled from both Guanghua University and Shanghai Law College in the city for causing student unrest. The police bureau is continuing to interrogate the ten suspects in custody, and a decision on how to handle them will be made soon.

### Dance Hall Case Continues Interrogation, Meng Yan and Others Post Bail

[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Attorney's Office continued to hold court yesterday. Four workers from the Social Affairs Bureau were summoned in the morning, but they did not appear. In the afternoon, the dancers Xiao Beijing Meng Yan, Wang Weihua, Chen Juping, tea server Fang Zhi, Wang Xianlang, and "Xiao Lang" Yuan Heming, and others totaling twelve people, all appeared in court to be interrogated. The interrogation ended at around 4:00 PM, and the court ordered each of them to post bail and await further summons. When Meng Yan appeared in court yesterday, she was dressed plainly with two small braids, like a little girl. Those who didn't know her would hardly believe she was a popular dancer. Before leaving, she rode in a rickshaw with a bailiff to find someone to post bail, and she showed no sign of sadness.

### Upon Expiration of Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit, Please Continue to Offset According to Original Method

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Appraisal Committee for Unlicensed Goods Arriving at the Port recently held a meeting and decided that when one-sixth of the special foreign currency certificate of deposit expires, it should still be exchanged for legal tender according to the exchange rate of the Balance Fund Committee. If it is used to offset the foreign exchange payment for goods permitted for import, a foreign exchange settlement certificate must be provided separately. The Shanghai Wool Textile Industry Association sent a letter to the committee yesterday requesting that the foreign currency certificate of deposit continue to be offset according to the original method. Because the industry suffered losses when its wool, which arrived at the port last year without a license and with its own foreign exchange, was frozen, if a foreign exchange settlement certificate is still required, the value of the foreign currency certificate of deposit will inevitably depreciate greatly, and manufacturers holding the foreign currency certificate of deposit will suffer a serious blow, and the original intention of the government to establish the foreign currency certificate of deposit at that time will also be lost.

### Donating Gold Bracelet to Save Orphans, Sympathy for Bethany's Predicament

Since Bethany Orphanage launched a campaign to raise 150 billion yuan for land purchase and construction funds, people from all walks of life have been actively donating to the newspaper offices in the city that are collecting donations. Yesterday, someone named Xie An donated a gold bracelet weighing about one tael, and attached a short note, roughly stating, "Bethany's lawsuit has a profound impact on the psychology of the next generation in China. Now, to seek redress, there is only hope for the sympathy of society, so that the next generation will feel that there is still warmth in the world. Therefore, I, in my humble way, entrust your newspaper to hand over my wife's gold bracelet to the orphanage, hoping that all compatriots will work together with one heart and rush to donate, to avert this future catastrophe." In addition, many donors attached letters of concern, expressing sympathy for Bethany's unfortunate experience.

### Gasoline Prices Rise More Than 60%, Crowding at Gas Stations Slightly Reduced, Many Still Miss Out

[Report from Our Newspaper] Gasoline prices rose more than 60% yesterday, selling for 400,000 yuan per gallon. The crowding of cars at gas stations in recent days has been slightly reduced, but it is still in short supply, and most have been sold out in the morning. At present, each gas station is limited to selling between 900 and 1,800 gallons of gasoline per day. Taking 900 gallons as an example, only 45 trucks or 90 cars can be fully fueled each day, and many who arrive later miss out. Therefore, some vehicles drive to gas stations before dawn to wait in advance, and this situation is very common. According to the person in charge of the oil company, the gasoline reserves in the city are quite abundant, and the reason why there is often a shortage panic is entirely due to the government's restrictions on imports and difficulties in foreign exchange settlement.

### Eight Senators Petitioning, Sympathy Gained in Nanjing, Central Government Discusses Compromise Solution for Foreign Exchange Settlement Problems of Public Utilities

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 9th] Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, and others have been consulting and studying solutions for the problem of foreign exchange settlement for public utilities in Shanghai at the exchange rate of the Central Bank on the 8th and 9th. The Weng group generally sympathizes with Shanghai's demands. A compromise solution that the government's financial resources can afford and that does not conflict with the new foreign exchange policy has been discussed. It is possible to adopt a method of loans or advance settlement of a portion of the foreign exchange to partially resolve the factors that lead to price increases in public utilities. Yu Hongjun will respond to the Shanghai Senators Petitioning Team at the Central Bank in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 10th regarding this plan. The eight senators of the petitioning delegation are scheduled to return to Shanghai by the night train on the 10th.

Representatives Arrive in Nanjing Requesting Four Points

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 9th] The eight senators of the Shanghai City Council Petitioning Team petitioned the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs separately on the mornings and afternoons of the 9th, requesting four points: (1) Public utilities in Shanghai should settle foreign exchange at the exchange rate of the Central Bank; (2) Foreign exchange should be settled in advance for three months; (3) The coal price for June should be calculated based on the sum of the coal price in Qinhuangdao in May and the freight price in June. The Ministry of Economic Affairs should borrow money from the Central Bank to pre-purchase three months of coal reserves; (4) Customs surcharges should be reduced and calculated at the exchange rate or exempted from customs surcharges.

Ministries of Finance and Economics Agree in Principle

At around 10:00 AM, the eight senators first visited Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Tong Jiling. Tong stated that the foreign exchange settlement issue was not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Regarding borrowing money from the Central Bank to store three months of coal, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is willing to discuss it with President Yu. The coal price issue is also generally supported in principle, but it still needs to be studied. At 11:00 AM, the eight senators visited Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu. Wang stated that he could agree in principle to the points requested by the Shanghai City Council, but the detailed plan needs to be decided after detailed research with President Yu. Wang also stated that the government is currently facing financial difficulties. If public utilities settle foreign exchange at the Central Bank's exchange rate, and the rest is subsidized by the state, the government's burden is too great, and the plan needs to be carefully considered.

Premier Consults on Shanghai Commodity Prices

At 2:30 PM, the eight senators went to the Executive Yuan to petition. Premier Weng personally received them, listened to the senators state the reasons for each point of the petition, and inquired in detail about the economic situation in Shanghai. He understood the economic and commodity price situation in Shanghai and stated that he would discuss it in detail with the relevant ministers before replying. At the same time, Premier Weng stated that the economic situation in Shanghai is sufficient to affect the whole country, and the price increase of public utilities is enough to stimulate the rise in commodity prices. He is determined to find ways to stabilize Shanghai's economy and commodity prices.

### News Practitioners' Rice Rationing, Civil Affairs and Food Distribution Committee Formulates Methods

To be Announced After Approval by the Municipal Government Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Civil Affairs and Food Distribution Committee previously decided to give preferential rice rations to news practitioners in the city, but then suddenly canceled it for some reason. The committee held an ad hoc meeting yesterday morning to discuss the matter. After the meeting, reporters asked Director Wu, who presided over the committee, about the new decision made at the meeting. He did not give a definite indication, only saying that the methods had been drafted and would be announced only after being approved by the municipal government meeting on the 11th. Reporters also learned from the side that rice rationing for news practitioners may still be handled in accordance with the methods previously established by the committee.

### Hammering Artillery Shells, Explosion Injures Four

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Wanshun Chang Iron Factory at No. 4 Son, Lane 612, Tiantong Road, is engaged in buying large quantities of old drills. At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, workers suddenly used a hammer to strike an artillery shell. With a loud noise, it exploded on the spot, injuring four workers.

Afterwards, the responsible North Railway Station Police Branch sent personnel to investigate the source of the batch of old drills in order to verify the case.

### Amidst International Cooperation to Ban Opium, Poisonous Substances are Repeatedly Discovered Being Imported, Detaining French Mail Steamer, Prosecutor Investigates, Captain and More Than 50 Others Suspected

[Report from Our Newspaper] The French mail steamer Andro Lebon arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The customs seized a large batch of smuggled poisonous substances, and the details have been recorded in previous reports. The steamer is currently berthed at Buoy Nos. 10 and 11 and is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 1:00 PM today, returning to France via the original route. It is also heard that the prosecutor boarded the ship for inspection yesterday, and it is still uncertain whether the ship can set sail today. The 180 passengers on the steamer boarded last night, and 260 tons of export goods have also been loaded.

[Another Report] Following the smuggling by the Mobil Oil Company's tanker "Charles Mayer," the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Team recently discovered another batch of smuggled opium in the bottom machine room of the French mail steamer Andro Lebon, totaling six packages, each weighing two pounds, for a total of twelve pounds. The outer skin was wrapped in Marseilles newspapers. In addition, an empty wooden box was found in the oil storage void column in the machine room, with traces of opium residue on the wooden board.

The steamer came from Marseilles via Boston, the Suez Canal, Colombo, Singapore, and Hong Kong to Shanghai. After the anti-smuggling personnel discovered the opium, Liu Xuehai, director of the Shanghai Office of the National Opium Prohibition Committee, believed that the matter was related to international opium smuggling and violated our country's opium prohibition laws. He immediately sent special commissioners Cui Junpeng and Liu Xueshi to go to the Gonghexiang Wharf with Prosecutor Shen Zusheng of the Shanghai Local Court and customs personnel to detain the steamer for inspection. After investigation, it was found that the captain Bosche Ando, the head of the machine room Arbez, and four others, including the fueler, should bear major responsibility. It is heard that the judicial authorities will detain them to investigate the source of the opium. More than 50 other crew members on the ship are also suspected, and they were ordered to have their fingerprints taken and kept for investigation and research. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai today, but due to the occurrence of this case, it will be postponed. It is heard that the relevant authorities attach great importance to the occurrence of this case because the Third International Conference on Cooperation for Opium Suppression has just been completed, and the international community is seeking to strengthen close cooperation to eliminate international drugs.

### Ordering Vehicles Creates Disputes, Nanjing Mayor Sues Huamei Trading Company, Demands Return of $77,000 USD Deposit

[Report from Our Newspaper] Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi previously sued the Huamei Engineering and Industrial Trading Company in the city, claiming that Hulbu did not fulfill the contract and requesting the defendant to return the deposit. Now that the defendant has gone to Hong Kong, the court has scheduled a retrial for the 21st. It is reported that on April 17, 1935, the defendant signed a contract with the Nanjing Municipal Government to order 30 buses made by the American Mack factory, worth approximately US$255,000. Later, on the 23rd of the same month, the defendant was given a deposit of US$75,000 (equivalent to 251.125 million yuan). According to the contract, the goods should have been delivered before the end of March 1936. Unexpectedly, the defendant did not deliver the goods after the deadline. Subsequently, our government promulgated regulations on the management of foreign exchange, and the Nanjing Municipal Government was unable to obtain foreign exchange, resulting in the imported vehicles purchased from the factory. The Nanjing Municipal Government then asked the defendant to return the deposit, but the defendant refused. After several negotiations, the defendant agreed to return 780 million yuan in national currency. The Nanjing Municipal Government believed that the US$75,000 deposit paid was significantly different from the current value and filed a lawsuit requesting the defendant to return the original deposit. In addition, the court ordered the Nanjing Municipal Government to pay 315.59 million yuan in litigation fees. Shen applied for an exemption on the grounds that the Nanjing Municipal Government's treasury was empty, but it was not approved, and he has now found a way to pay the full amount.

### Canadian Business Invites People from All Walks of Life to Promote Agricultural Machinery

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Zongqiong, a special representative of the Canadian Massey-Harris Plow Agricultural Machinery Company stationed in China, plans to supply new agricultural machinery to improve China's agricultural technology. The company's business is now entrusted to the China Tung Hui Machinery Company. Agricultural entrepreneurs with foresight have been inquiring about the details from the company. General Lu Xishan, Chairman of Shanxi Province, sent a letter to Tung Hui Company, ordering ten wheat harvesters. The performance of this harvester is excellent, each equivalent to the manpower of 950 farmers. Unfortunately, the foreign exchange quota is very strict, and it cannot be imported for the time being. Yesterday, Chen Zongqiong hosted the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the press to explain the performance of this agricultural machinery. All parties were very interested in this and hoped that the government would attach importance to it.

### Two Stone Figures Have Changed Owners, Will Send Letter to MGM to Request Removal

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city government has always believed that the two stone figures near the racecourse in the city belonged to the Westerner Maler. When the police bureau removed the plaques next to the statues a few days ago, it notified the Maler Company. However, according to the company's reply yesterday, it was confirmed that the property rights had long belonged to the American MGM Film Company. According to the information, the land originally belonged to Sassoon and was leased to the Maler Company before the war. After the restoration, it was sold to MGM Company for the purpose of building a theater, so the stone figures no longer belong to Maler. It is now known that the city government is preparing to send a letter to the person in charge of MGM Company, asking them to cooperate with the police bureau to remove the figures within a limited time. If they fail to do so, the police bureau will enforce the removal.

### Dragons Playing with the Phoenix, Rehearsing Racing Today, Crew Members Are All Aquatic Heroes Who Can Lurk at the Bottom of the River for Half an Hour

[Report from Our Newspaper] For the Dragon Boat Festival races, the city's ferry industry has assembled eleven dragon boats. According to the annual custom, one of them, the "Phoenix Boat," is specially invited by the industry to more than 20 young women who are familiar with aquatic life to serve as temporary crew members. The male crew members on the other dragon boats are all experts in the Huangpu River salvage and have excellent aquatic skills that allow them to lurk at the bottom of the Huangpu River for more than half an hour.

### Zhu Bing Sold Oil Fraud Case, Sentenced to Seven Months in Prison in Court, Central Bookstore Paper Case Requests Several Times More Compensation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lin Shuhua of Shenglong Oil Store and Qin Yongxiang of Yongsheng Oil Store jointly sued Zhu Bing, general manager of New Sui Company, for fraud in the District Court. The case was heard by Judge Shi Yuhuang of Criminal Court No. 9 yesterday morning. After Zhu's defense lawyer Chen Zhenqi stood up to defend, Zhu was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment in court, with the attached civil lawsuit transferred to the Civil Court for trial. It is reported that in April last year, Zhu Bing told the two plaintiffs that he could distribute 1,000 tons of diesel from the oil company, with a cargo value of 178 million yuan, and promised to sell 200 tons to each of the two plaintiffs, and paid a warehouse receipt from the oil company to each of them. On April 24 and May 1 of the same month, the two plaintiffs went to pick up the goods one after another, but were rejected by the oil company. The two negotiated with Zhu, and Zhu agreed to return the principal and interest of the goods worth 290 million yuan, and signed six checks from the China Industrial Bank on June 3 and June 5, which were all rejected upon maturity. The two plaintiffs believed that Zhu had deliberately defrauded them, so they sued the District Court. When the court was held yesterday morning, Zhu stated in court that he had been operating the New Sui Company for 12 years and had ships. The reason why he failed to deliver the oil to the plaintiffs as scheduled was because the oil company delayed, not because he deliberately defrauded them. The court had previously investigated with the oil company whether Zhu Bing had routinely distributed oil, and yesterday, the court ordered Zhu to read the company's reply letter in court. The letter stated: "In May 1936, Zhu Bing applied for oil distribution. After investigation, it was found that it did not match the facts and was not approved for reply," etc. At this point, Zhu was speechless, and the sentence was pronounced in court as above.

[Another Report] In the case of Ping Jinya of the Central Bookstore suing Zhu Bing for defrauding him of money, the District Court previously sentenced Zhu to criminal penalties and attached a civil lawsuit, requesting Zhu to pay for the newspaper ordered. It was transferred to the Civil Court. Yesterday, after Zhu was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment, the District Court held a trial in Civil Court No. 7. Ping stated that the white paper attached to the civil lawsuit was calculated at 1 million yuan per ream, but the current price has risen to 7 million yuan per ream, so he requested an increase in payment. After questioning by the court, the court ordered to wait for further verification.

### Wireless Radio Revolution: New American Manufacturing Method; High-Speed Mass Production Using Circuit Printing Machines

[Report from our Newspaper] According to the Chinese Amateur Radio Association, the United States has recently developed a revolutionary new method for manufacturing wireless radios. Using a newly invented "circuit printing machine," they can mass produce "coils" at high speed, as easily as printing books, eliminating the need for the old method of winding. There are currently three methods used for this revolutionary new process. The method involves using various metal powder conductive films and chemical raw materials, such as brushing and spraying, to print circuits onto a type of insulating panel. Hundreds or thousands of sheets can be produced in an instant. By using these new coils in combination with modern miniature capacitors, vacuum tubes, and other components, transceivers, radios, hearing aids, and the like can be made to be extremely small and exquisite, unprecedented. The smallest radios are only about the size of a pack of cigarettes. Furthermore, due to the high-speed production, the cost is reduced accordingly.

### Minimum Cinema Ticket Prices: No Immediate Plans for Adjustment

[Report from our Newspaper] The allocation of 30% of seats at minimum ticket prices in movie theaters was decided upon at a meeting held a few days ago by the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Police Bureau. At that time, the Motion Picture Association stated that the quota of price-controlled seats in the rotation theaters totaled more than 8,000, with ticket sales only amounting to 60,000 yuan. This significantly impacted the operating revenue of second, third, and fourth-run theaters, and they requested the Bureau of Social Affairs to remedy the situation. After the responsible department of the bureau submitted a request for instructions to Director Wu, representatives from second, third, and fourth-run theaters, including Pingan and Jinmen, visited Director Wu yesterday to request relief. According to Director Wu, the 30% minimum ticket price requirement was decided upon at a municipal meeting, and the Bureau of Social Affairs must strictly enforce it first.

### Major Robbery Case Involving a Female Tycoon: Motivated by Revenge; Sixteen Perpetrators Arrested, Recovered Original Value of Over 9 Billion

[Report from our Newspaper] The city's well-known female jewelry broker, Shen Chen Binjuan, was ambushed on the 3rd of last month. As she walked out of her residence at Lane 155, No. 14 Julu Road and boarded her car, intending to go to Nanshi to meet with colleagues, three bandits suddenly jumped into the car and robbed her of various valuable jewelry, including diamonds and jade ornaments, worth over 10 billion yuan. During the robbery, Shen resisted in the car, causing her to be injured in the head by the bandits' pistol butts, nearly resulting in her death. After this shocking daytime robbery occurred, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping was enraged and immediately ordered the Criminal Investigation Division to solve the case within two weeks. Upon receiving the order, the division chief personally led Section Chief Feng Qishan to the scene of the crime for inspection and went to the victim's home to gather various materials that could be used as a starting point for the investigation. After three days, on the afternoon of the 6th, they finally obtained a clue. They mobilized the entire division to track down the main and accessory offenders based on the information obtained, going through Suzhou, Wuxi, Jingjiang, Jiangyin, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Guazhou, Yizheng, Tongzhou, Guangzhou, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other places. They ultimately solved the case within the time limit and arrested the main and accessory offenders, Qian Zuoren, Wang Liang, Xu Wendian, Liu Chuntao, Ye Kangsheng, Zhang Dawei, Chen Yuemei, and nine others, including Xu Wenyi and Xu Tiansheng, who committed the public danger of destroying evidence, as well as seven people who received the stolen goods, Ding Ai Guiying, Wang Dai Xuexian, Chen Wang Yune, Li Chumin, Ye Hongchang, Ye Gong Bihan, and Li Jiyun. Two-thirds of the stolen goods have been recovered. During this time, the Huangpu and Lujiawan police sub-bureaus also mobilized to assist. However, two other main offenders, Ding Daxiong and Wang Shuxian, are still at large.

Planning of the Robbery Process

According to the confession of the arrested offender Qian Zuoren, the motive for the robbery was that Shen was usually too harsh and that not long before the incident, they had cooperated with her to sell jewelry in Ping, but the profits were all taken by her privately. Out of anger, they discussed with the fugitives Ding Daxiong and Wang Shuxian about retaliating against her when the opportunity arose. Qian then took on the responsibility of providing information, while Ding and Wang, along with Wang Liang, the current driver of the Land Administration Bureau, Xu Wenxing, Liu Chuntao, and others, planned everything in the Chinese Hotel's Room 320. In mid-April, Qian learned that Shen had brokered a large batch of valuable jewelry and was about to sell it on the market. He then watched her residence day and night, paying attention to her movements, and contacted Ding, Wang, and others at any time. At that time, their so-called revenge had already been decided to be carried out through robbery. At 2:10 PM on May 3, this tense prelude finally began. As Shen was dressed up and about to go out and board her car, Ding Daxiong, Wang Shuxian, and the driver Wang Liang, who had been lying in wait, rushed forward, held Shen hostage with a gun, and monitored her driver. Then, Wang Liang drove quickly westward. During the journey, Shen resisted desperately twice, causing her to be injured in the head with the gun's butt and fall unconscious. The two cloth bags containing diamonds and jewels worth over 10 billion yuan, which she had hidden close to her body, ultimately fell into the hands of the bandits. When the bandits felt that they had achieved their goal, they stopped the car near Wukang Road and Hunan Road, pushed Shen and her driver down, and continued to drive quickly westward. After being pushed down, Shen woke up, filled with grief and anger. Her driver first went to report the incident to the police sub-bureau in charge, and then took himself to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The next day, he provided a detailed list of the lost items and reported it to the police headquarters, offering a reward of 20% of the total value to track down the perpetrators.

Thirty-Six Strategies, Running Away is the Best Strategy

After the bandits robbed this huge fortune, they soon abandoned the car at the intersection of Dihua Middle Road and Huashan Road and immediately informed the relevant accomplices, telling them that the deed was done and to wait for their share. They also met Qian Zuoren at the Sweetness Cafe on Linsen Middle Road to discuss the aftermath. They all agreed that running away was the best strategy, so Ding first gave Qian Zuoren a two-carat diamond ring and a pearl necklace, instructing him to mortgage them for money and then go to Caoshan or Beitou in Taiwan to meet again and talk further. After parting ways, Ding and Wang not only distributed a small portion of the stolen goods to their accomplices but also hid the majority of them with their wives and concubines in their hometown of No. 35 Zhongqing Lane in Hangzhou and Chenda Lane in Yangxi Township, Nanshi, Wuxi. The whereabouts of the two men were then unknown.

At this time, police personnel had obtained clues and arrested the accomplice Xu Wenyi at No. 402 Beijing West Road on the afternoon of the 6th. After interrogation, he confessed to the previous events. The police then followed the confession and went to various places to arrest the offenders one by one. Among them, the main offender Qian Zuoren and his concubine were apprehended at the International Hotel in Taiwan, but the two main offenders Ding and Wang are still at large. However, the two guns used by the offenders during the robbery and most of the stolen goods hidden in their homes have been recovered. In addition, the small ornaments distributed by the two offenders to their accomplices have also been recovered, without any omissions. It is estimated to be worth over 9 billion yuan.

Recovered Loot After the Case Was Solved

As for the recovered loot, it includes: a diamond watch, a diamond brooch, a red gold diamond-set women's watch, a 3.70-carat diamond ring, a 14K gold sapphire ring, a jade diamond ring, a ruby ring, five pieces of green jade, four jade feet, a ruby diamond ring, a platinum diamond marquis ring, a jade "duck egg" gem, two jade ring faces, a jade diamond ring, sixty-nine pearls, a 4-diamond gold diamond ring, a 1.60-carat diamond ring, twelve diamond skins, a 4.50-carat square-cut independent diamond, four 2-carat independent diamonds, a 0.50-carat small diamond, four 0.40-carat small diamonds, 130 US dollars, 63 million fiat currency, and 911,000 Taiwan dollars in Taiwan Bank drafts.

### Cotton Mill Employees as Thieves: Main and Accessory Offenders All Arrested

[Report from our Newspaper] The youths Su Ye and Jia Sheng were formerly employees of the Zhongnan Cotton Mill. Later, they stopped working due to some reason and wandered around unemployed. On the 2nd, through the introduction of Cheng Jingwen, the guard stationed at the No. 5 warehouse of Zhongfang, they bought a Ma brand pistol and five bullets from Shen Gen of Ouyang Road, stating that they would pay on the 5th. The next day, Su and Jia, along with their friends Qian Shaojie and Qian Zhaokui, rented a room at the Continental Hotel, Room 320, under the pseudonym Zhang Zhiming. Qian Shaojie went to the Jilie Wireless Radio Company on North Sichuan Road to buy an Emerson brand seven-tube radio and instructed someone to deliver it to the Continental Hotel for payment. The company instructed apprentice Shen Xuren to deliver it. Upon arrival, Su and the other four used three Boy Scout knives and a pistol to intimidate Shen and tied him up with rope. They then took the machine and went to the Mingxing Pawnshop on Guangxi Road, where they pawned it for 50 million yuan in fiat currency. They used 10 million yuan to pay for the gun and divided the remaining money among themselves. At 11:00 AM on the 7th, they again used the pseudonym Liu Cunlong to rent a room at the Weida Hotel on Linsen West Road, Room 105. Su went to the Shangwen Stationery Store at No. 89 Fuzhou Road to buy two Remington typewriters. Before long, the company sent employee Xu Huilin to deliver them. He was again tied up in the same way and robbed of a gold ring and a fountain pen. They then ordered Qian Zhaokui to hire a Xiang Sheng taxi to escape with the stolen goods. Xu Huilin, who was tied up in the room, shouted for help after seeing the thieves leave. At the same time, the Changxun Police Sub-bureau had also received a report. The chief and deputy chief of the sub-bureau, Yan Chengsheng and Yan Xianghu, along with Section Chief Ren Gongqin, ordered patrolman Zhu Huanzhang to lead police officers Zhang Yuliang, Yin Xiede, and Zhu Yunlin to rush to the Weida Hotel.

### Superior Japonica Rice Exceeds 8 Million Mark; Rice Prices Reach New Highs; Mayor Cables Premier Weng to Suppress Rice Prices in Production Areas

[Report from our Newspaper] Rice prices continued to rise yesterday, following the upward trend of the previous two days, with an average increase of about 300,000 yuan per stone. According to information obtained from the Bureau of Social Affairs, premium japonica rice is priced at 8 million yuan in the North City market, and special japonica rice is priced at 8 million yuan in the South City market and 8.3 million yuan in the North City market, with a continued upward trend. Yesterday's arrivals at the North and South City markets were also scarce, with a total of 3,121 stones arriving.

Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs stated yesterday that the economy is a whole, and it would not be fair to only suppress rice prices while other commodity prices continue to rise. Compared with other commodity prices, the rate of increase in rice prices is still relatively moderate. The only way to suppress the increase in rice prices is to release physical goods for sale. However, since the supply and sale of rice was stopped this week, rice prices have been impossible to control.

[Additional News] Mayor Wu attaches great importance to the recent fluctuations in commodity prices, especially the price of rice. Because the price increase in the producing areas has been drastic, it has had the greatest impact on the rice price in this city. Yesterday afternoon, he specifically reported to Premier Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan via long-distance telephone, requesting him to instruct the Ministry of Food to devise proper measures to suppress rice prices in the producing areas in order to stabilize the people's livelihood.

### Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes: Direct Line Ascent

Yesterday, the rice market saw even more fierce price increases, with various types of rice reaching new highs. The reason is that the prices of various goods outside the industry are rising rapidly, causing cargo owners to raise their prices, with very few willing to sell. Premium japonica rice finally reached the 8 million mark, and special premium japonica rice broke through 8 million and reached a peak of 8.3 million. Bo Dao and Xian rice all increased by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. However, because rice shops had already stocked up on white silver yuan rice, the route turned sluggish, increasing slightly by 100,000. The South City market saw white japonica rice at 7.75 million, but the closing was even firmer, with prices being raised by another 200,000 yuan. Later, news came that the market in Xishi was rising, and people's sentiment was exceptionally strong.

Flour prices rose fiercely, with excessive floating capital and a market full of buying interest.

Red beans opened at 8.4 million, with the highest price reaching 9 million. Tianjin sesame was heavily absorbed, soaring by one million, and raw peanuts were generally increased by the Guang gang, rising by 1.5 million to 2 million.

Cooking oil soared, each reaching a peak. Yisheng oil rose most among other cooking oils, with Dasheng factory's pure Yisheng oil at 22.5 million yuan, an increase of about 2.2 to 2.3 million. Dayou soybean oil reached a maximum of 19.5 million, closing at 19.3 million, an increase of about 1.7 million. Rapeseed oil also rose by 1.7 million. Small vehicle sesame oil surged to a peak of 24 million. Soybean cakes were unanimously priced at 2 million, at 2.05 million. It was still impossible to buy on the subsequent market, an increase of about 170,000 to 180,000 yuan.

No. 1520 and others successively sold, big client Gu Mou secretly sold, passing the news that the President will visit Shanghai, falling sharply near noon, retreating to a low price of 3,520 yuan, closing at 3,540 yuan. Compared with the previous close, Xinyi Huaxin rose to the limit, Hengfeng Tongyi rose by 10%, Xinhe Meiya Zhongfa Xinguang Jingfu Qinxing Rongfeng Zhongsihua rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly.

### Wuxi Bank Zhuang Issued Promissory Notes; Announcement to Recall Within Three Days

### Vast Amounts of Floating Capital from North China; Extremely Loose Money Supply

The money supply is still extremely loose, and vast amounts of floating capital from the north continue to flow south. Yesterday, in the check exchange among banking and money industries, banks and bureaus had only a small amount of difference, only 265 billion. Among them, the Central Bank's difference was 115.4 billion, the Bank of China's difference was 274.3 billion, the Jiaotong Bank's difference was 169.2 billion, the Farmers Bank's difference was 82 billion, the Zhongxin Bureau's difference was 2 billion, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau's difference was 168.3 billion, the Cooperative Treasury's difference was 43.4 billion, the big exchange's difference was 125.8 billion, the small exchange's difference was 306.4 billion, and foreign merchant banks' difference was 166.8 billion.

### Exchange Settlement Certificates: Prices Continue to Rise

[Report from our Newspaper] The price of exchange settlement certificates continued to rise yesterday, with prices of 440,000 and 450,000 both available. The highest reached 450,050 yuan. When combined with the listed price, each US dollar has been converted into more than 120,000 yuan in national currency. However, with the recent rapid increase in the black market price of US dollars, the above selling price is still far from the market price; the number of transactions is also not as high as expected. Some importers and exporters still regard this as a transitional measure, so they are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. Also, exporters have always considered the seven-day deadline for certificates to be too short.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Rise All the Way: Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Breaks the 400 Million Mark

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were strong due to strong purchase appetite from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other gangs. With each loose silver condition, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rushed past the 400 million yuan mark in the morning, a surge of 40 million yuan compared to the previous close. Upon news of rising Indian cotton, the current cotton cargo owners raised especially high prices, and the buying appetite became even more frenzied. The market rose again to a peak of 440 million yuan at the close, a further increase of 45 million yuan compared to the previous day.

The remaining counts of fine yarn were all driven higher by eager retail purchases, rising uniformly by 15 to 26 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions also featured extraordinarily loose money supply, and the market was filled with buying shouts. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 440,000 yuan upon initial opening, with a small number of transactions. As Shanxi and the Northern gangs absorbed them, and the Hankou gang purchased a great deal, the market presented a case of demand exceeding supply. The Dragon Head cloth rose again, breaking the 9 million mark, and directly went up to 9.2 million yuan at the close, a huge increase of 790,000 yuan compared to the previous day. All other cloths also followed suit and rose.

Another report: After the close of the cloth market, there was a sudden rumor that the highest authorities were about to visit Shanghai, and people's sentiments suddenly became timid. The securities market took the lead in reversing the wind, and various stocks outside the market saw fierce declines. The Dragon Head fine cloth retreated from 9.3 million to 100,000, with people willing to sell. Other stocks also fell below the closing price.

The committee has already telegraphed the Bank of China in Hankou, requesting that it handle the matter in accordance with the instructions of the Four-Shareholders Joint Office.

### Business Loans Transformed into Pledge Loans: National Banks Have Already Begun Processing

[Report from our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discount Committee and Industrial and Mining Consultant Committee held its ninth meeting yesterday, chaired by Cai Gongchun, to discuss 14 applications for pledge loan transfers. Six of these were applications from the Jiaotong Bank to transfer production loans that had already been issued into pledge loans. These cases are all handled in accordance with the National Bank's same-industry discount rules. Therefore, the National Bank has already begun to transfer business loans from various banks into pledge loans; however, as the market's money supply has been quite loose recently, there is not much room for the National Bank to use the discount policy for remedy. However, if the money supply becomes tight, the National Bank's discounting will have a great effect on stabilizing finance. The National Bank's current policy focuses on recycling floating capital, but it should also fully facilitate legitimate loans.

### Business Tax Payment by Check: Providing as Much Convenience as Possible to Merchants

### Hong Kong Rice Prices Decline

[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 9th] The price of high-quality rice here has fallen by about fifteen yuan in the past two days.

Since the new grain harvested in the spring within Guangdong Province landed in the rice markets of Taipingdong and Shilong a week ago, smugglers have been active in hopes of obtaining new grain to transport to the Hong Kong market.

### Cancellation of Export Price Limits for Tung Oil: Settlement and Release Will Be Based on International Market Prices

Our country's exports of tung oil were previously due to American tung oil producers mistakenly believing that our country's merchants had the possibility of dumping, and they requested the U.S. government to provide relief, and the U.S. Treasury Department and Customs conducted investigations. At that time, international market oil prices plummeted, buyers waited and watched, and there was a continued downward trend. In order to protect the interests of exporters and tung farmers, the Export Control Commission, after consulting with relevant agencies and the tung oil export industry, implemented a minimum exchange settlement price system from February 25th of this year. Since its implementation, overseas market prices have remained relatively stable. Now the American side has cleared up the above misunderstanding, and the U.S. government has officially cancelled the investigation. Furthermore, our government's foreign exchange policy has recently changed, adopting a method of exchange settlement certificates. From now on, exported goods should be settled based on international market prices, and there is no need to limit prices again. On the 9th, the committee convened a meeting of relevant agencies and representatives of tung oil exporters, and as a result, it was decided to cancel the export price limits for tung oil starting from June 10th. From now on, exports of tung oil will all be settled and released based on international market prices.

### Municipal Government Sends Letter to Jiaotong University: Please Stabilize the School, Pay Attention to Student Meetings, and Prohibit Incitement and Trouble-Making

Hereafter, students of all schools must obtain permission from the school authorities before holding meetings on campus, otherwise the school will handle the matter in accordance with school regulations. If any illegal activities occur during the meeting, in addition to punishment in accordance with school regulations, the government will also be notified. B. From now on, if students from other schools attempt to enter the school to promote incitement and trouble-making, they should be strictly refused. If necessary, the police station and the schools of the external students can be notified to assist in punishment, etc. These should be recorded and reported accordingly. It is hoped that your school will investigate and handle the matter." The Jiaotong University authorities issued a notice yesterday, which, in addition to copying the original letter, also added a statement, briefly stating that the school already had regulations regarding the above-mentioned measures A and B, which had been announced and recorded. However, due to the long period of implementation, there may be negligence and laxity.

The Municipal Government believes that it is necessary for the government and all citizens of the city to know the truth of this incident in detail, and it cannot allow the manipulation of a small number of professional students to deceive the government, society, and schools. The Jiaotong University authorities should quickly investigate the small number of professional students and severely punish them, without further condoning them.

### Siam Informs Our Ambassador: Requests Regarding Overseas Chinese Schools Have Been Firmly Rejected

[Central News Agency Bangkok, 9th] The Siamese Foreign Ministry yesterday informed our country's embassy in Siam, firmly rejecting the embassy's request regarding the closure of overseas Chinese schools in Siam. The Siamese Foreign Ministry reiterated in the notification that the Siamese government hopes that all overseas Chinese schools in Siam will abide by Siamese law, and at the same time refuted our country's embassy's claim that the closure of overseas Chinese schools undermined the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. However, according to the Sino-Siamese Treaty signed two years ago, overseas Chinese are allowed to open schools in Siam, but they must comply with the Private School Law. This law has already existed since the signing of the Sino-Siamese Treaty, the notification stated. The Siamese Ministry of Education does not intend to make concessions this time, and all applications for registration of overseas Chinese will be reviewed in accordance with the system prescribed by the Ministry of Education. The Siamese Ministry of Education has recently announced a decree regarding school affairs, stating that foreigners are no longer allowed to sell snacks and other items on Siamese school grounds, which is clearly aimed at the Chinese hawkers currently selling snacks near these schools.

### High Hurdles Champion of the World Games: Dillard Has the Highest Hopes, Dillard's Performance is the Best Among Three Masters in the World

[Our Newspaper Special Translation New York, 7th United Press] Dillard, a black athlete from Boltwin Wallace University in the United States, who has the highest hopes for the high hurdles at the World Games this fall, has been undefeated in the recent 67 hurdle races. His recent performance is excellent, with a time of 14 seconds in the 110-meter high hurdles. According to the World Games record, it is 14.1 seconds.

According to sports observers, the only ones who can barely compete with Dillard at present are Liddman of Sweden and Qu Llozi of Argentina. Dillard himself is unwilling to make a hasty judgment on the World Games. He only said: "I can only compare my results with Qu Llozi. My record for the 120-yard high hurdles is 13.6 seconds (unofficial world record), while Qu's is 14 seconds. As for Liddman, I admire him very much. I would be very satisfied if I could have such results nine years later." Dillard is 24 this year, and Liddman is 33. In recent competitions, Dillard has won victories in Europe and the United States.

Publishing Industry

### On American Bestsellers

— Yi Yi

In America, there are so-called bestsellers. How a book becomes a bestseller has been researched, but it's hard to say whether a book will sell well or not. There are various reasons; the author's reputation, printing technology, and distribution methods are all related. Some are within expectations, while others are completely unexpected.

That being said, it's worth compiling statistics on American bestsellers over the years. It is said that books containing religious ideas sell the widest. In the colonial era, 13 out of 20 bestsellers were truly religious education, and 4 had religious overtones. Before 1915, there were a total of 279 bestsellers, of which 87 contained religious meaning, accounting for about one-third of the total. After 1915, there were fewer, but the influence was still strong. Furthermore, 15 percent of bestseller authors were missionary priests.

There are many stimulating bestsellers, writing about riots, murders, improper sexual behavior, adventurous affairs, and so on, one after another. These types of books may not necessarily have a bad influence, but they can easily arouse people's emotions. Well-written ones can be both moving and lamentable. Generally, each book always focuses on one point, with different natures and great complexity.

Biographies and Historical Novels

Among these bestsellers, 10 are historical, 8 are legends, and 49 are historical novels. Someone once joked that a biography of Lincoln can always be a bestseller, and books about dogs and doctors also sell easily. So why not write a book about "Lincoln's doctor's dog"? It would surely "make paper as expensive as jade in Luoyang." Books depicting individuals, especially those with adventurous qualities, are also popular. In novels, depicting characters' personalities is most important. Almost two-thirds of bestsellers are good at depicting characters. There are also many vivid descriptions of scenery and actions, accounting for more than half. From 1775 to 1915, it can be said to be an era of emotional impulse, with many such books. Later, they became relatively milder.

Speaking of writing style, it is difficult to make a generalization because of different styles. Many bestsellers are literary works in themselves and have intrinsic value. Many others are written quite well, reaching a certain standard in terms of writing. However, poorly written ones, the so-called "lower grade," also account for one-third. We can easily pick out a few that are terribly written, with almost no literary flavor, showing that readers do not pay attention to the writing. What makes them bestsellers is not the writing, but other characteristics. Someone once studied novels that were poorly written but sold well. His conclusion was that writing doesn't matter much; what matters most are the material and structure. The writing in bestsellers doesn't necessarily have to be very good.

Democracy and Humor

Democratic ideas are also one of the reasons for bestsellers. The scope of this term is too broad. Here, it refers to the lives and expectations of Americans, including both fiction and non-fiction, accounting for about four-tenths. New books sell easily, but "fashionable" doesn't necessarily mean a good book. Few can be listed as "upper grade." Speculation cannot make a book a bestseller, but to make a book a bestseller, it is necessary to seize a good opportunity. "Timely" books can be sold with half the effort. One-fourth of bestsellers contain humorous elements, including 17 that are entirely humorous. Among these 17, 7 are recent works. The appeal of "sex" is still strong, but it is most afraid of becoming obscene, and many places prohibit its publication. Generally, after such books become bestsellers, there will inevitably be a backlash, so they fluctuate and change at any time. One-eighth of bestsellers are set in foreign countries, full of exoticism. Children's books also account for one-fifth. Children's favorite books are often also loved by adults, and the line is difficult to draw.

Publishers and Literati

The publishing industry is one of the most interesting in modern commerce. Publishers often interact with literati and scholars, making great contributions to modern thought and culture. Sometimes, they suddenly discover amazing works in the manuscripts they receive, perhaps written by a hungry author in an attic. Only they can transform that unknown author into a famous one. However, they also have many troublesome problems to solve: paper, typesetting, binding all need to be carefully calculated. Even when sales are very good, they have to worry about not being able to reprint in time, or when one book is published, the second book is difficult to publish. Publishing a new book is like buying a lottery ticket; no one can guess whether it will sell well or not. Books by established authors are not necessarily good sellers, and books by unknown authors are even more speculative, although there are many "unexpected hits." When accepting a book, one must have true insight. There are also many books that have been rejected many times, but later achieved unexpected success.

The title of a book is somewhat related to sales, but this cannot be generalized. The shorter the title, the better, but long titles can also be bestsellers. Is a specific title better than a vague one? This is also hard to say. Family-oriented titles seem to make people feel warm and friendly. The most wonderful thing is that many convoluted titles, which are difficult to read, can also attract people's attention. However, the most important thing is to be interesting and moving. Cover design, typesetting fonts, and binding methods can all be studied. A well-designed cover is an aid to sales, but "cheap editions" of bestsellers, using only thin paper for the cover, sell even more widely. In general, bestsellers in the 19th century had poor paper quality, small fonts, and were poorly printed. It was not until 1900 that binding gradually became more sophisticated. Beautiful illustrations are also very helpful for sales.

Celebrities and Advertisements

"Striking first" is one of the ways to become a bestseller. Before publication, send it to famous people for guidance, and promote it with exaggerated advertisements, sparing no expense. The best thing, of course, is to write book reviews. Good reviews can be used to promote it, and bad reviews are also powerful "counter-propaganda." Newspapers and magazines are all places to publish book advertisements. Recently, even wireless radio has been used. Turning them into movie scripts has become a fashion. Among the bestsellers published in 1914, 30 percent have been adapted into movies. As for novels, even non-fiction, published recently, it goes without saying. This has made the sales of books even better than before. Adapting them into plays can also promote sales, but not as attractive as adapting them into movies.

### The Complete Story of the Boxer Rebellion

— Tian Chunyin

Compiled by Wu Xuanyi, printed by Zhengzhong Bookstore

In the past hundred years of Chinese history, aside from the shifts in court politics, the Boxer Rebellion was a pivotal and epoch-making movement, the significance and value of which are still difficult to fully assess. There are countless books about this movement. Zhao Xingguo compiled a bibliography of historical materials in the seventh issue of the seventh volume of Renwen Monthly, divided into general records, provincial records, edicts, official documents, biographies, indemnities, and others, totaling nearly a hundred types. However, there are still omissions (such as Luo Dunyi's "Record of the Gengzi National Crisis" and "Anecdotes of the Boxer Rebellion"), and in recent years, there have been many old works newly reprinted, or new works elaborating on its significance or course. In addition, few foreign works are listed except for a few that have been translated into Chinese. According to the Englishman Pubnam Weale, author of "A Record of the Siege of the Legations During the Boxer Uprising", there are no fewer than forty-three English publications.

Among the foreign works, the best are Dr. G. E. Morrison's "Letters in London Times, Oct. 13th, 15th, 16th, 1900" and the French Minister's report to his home country (the French Minister at that time was Pichon). Millis also listed a dozen or so well-known examples in his "History of the Foreign Relations of the Qing Empire." Zhao's list includes "The Diary of Jing Shan," which is unreliable and has been definitively disproved. Other poems and essays, such as Fei Xixian's "Song of General Nie," Fan Zengxiang's "Before and After Rainbow Clouds," Zeng Guangjun's "Resignation of Fallen Leaves," and notebooks such as Chai Zhefan's "Fan Tianlu Conglu," can all be used as historical materials. The "Guangxu Gengzi Xin Chou Diary" mentioned in Zhao's list, written by an anonymous Qing person, is probably the work of Hua Xuelan (Ruian) from Tianjin. This book has been collated by Mr. Tao Menghe and published by Commercial Press.

The original name of this book is "China and the Accident: The Origin and the Development of the Boxer Movement, 1927. Yale University Press." The author is G. N. Steiger. The translator translated Chapters 7 to 13 (the translation claims it is "compiled," which should be changed to "translated" to be consistent with the facts). The preface states that the original author based his materials on the diplomatic archives of China and the West at the time, reports from missionaries, notes from Allied officers, and other private writings, but used very few Chinese materials. After reading it through, the author's arguments are fairly fair. Regarding the origin of the Boxers, he believed that there was a different view from that of Lao Naixuan. (Note: Lao Naixuan - Yu Chu, was a Qing loyalist who participated in the restoration of the Sixth Year of the Republic. He wrote "Three Types of Boxing Cases" and was the magistrate of Wuqiao at the time. His observations were close and generally considered first-class historical materials). Lao said that the Boxers were a secret society that had long existed, once declined, and whose original purpose was revolution. In 1898, it suddenly became popular again and focused on anti-Christian activities. This was because it originally intended to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, but after being co-opted by the Qing court, it focused on "destroying the foreigners." Steiger considered the Boxers to be the name used by the Beijing diplomatic missions, and their official name was the Righteous Harmony Society or the People's Militia, which was a voluntary organization and considered legal by the Qing court. After Guangxu's reform failed, Empress Dowager Cixi took power for the third time, and between 1898 and 1899, she discussed enriching and improving the people's militia and using modern weapons, and then ordered Zhili, Shandong, Shanxi, and Fengtian to implement it first. As for its religious phenomenon, it was because there were no large-scale new-style weapons to use, and since Westerners claimed to believe in divine protection, the Chinese also claimed to believe in the protection of local gods. In short, he believed that at the beginning of 1900, the Boxers were neither a revolutionary group nor a religious group, but a loyal voluntary militia. In fact, this statement does not conflict with Lao's at all, and Lao's statement may even be more profound than Steiger's.

Chapter 3 of Steiger's book, "The Pressure of the Diplomatic Corps in Beijing," and Chapter 4, "The Critical Period - May 28th to June 20th," record the inappropriate actions of the ministers of various countries and the contents of the diplomatic community in Beijing in great detail and appropriately. In general, the situation at the time could have been turned from a major issue into a minor one, but the ministers of various countries used demonstrations, force, and coercion to threaten the Chinese court and the public, until it became unmanageable. This statement is extremely accurate. From this, we can divide the expansion of the movement into the following stages: The demonstration of warships of various countries outside Dagu Port in the spring of 1900 was the first step, causing unrest among the residents along the coast. At the end of May 1900, the guards of various countries entered Beijing with their heads held high, with others sleeping under the bed, which was the second step, causing unrest among the residents along the Beijing-Tianjin route. On June 9 of the same year, the Seymour Allied Forces of about 2,000 people went to Beijing from Tianjin was the third step. In a short period of time, the attitude of the Qing court changed to active and indignant. Under the open killing of foreign troops, what else could they want other than greater ambition? And by taking the Tanggu Station and seizing the Dagu Forts after June 6, they openly declared war on the Qing court. The Qing court had no choice but to replace the declaration of war with recognition. As Steiger said, the ministers of various countries used threats and ultimatums to coerce the Qing government to suppress the Boxer Rebellion, but each use of force resulted in an increase in the degree of unrest among the Chinese people. Each concession made by the Qing court reduced the people's respect for it. He further believed that the ministers' ignorance of the Qing court's involvement and the actual power of the people's livelihoods was the reason for the expansion of the matter. He went on to say: "Although the mass movement was not an inevitable event, we can only assume that in the relationship between human beings, misunderstandings, arrogance, and ignorance are inevitable factors, so mass movements naturally occur. We cannot blame China and the West, but the main responsibility for the Gengzi Incident should fall on the powers and their formal or informal representatives."

The historical facts used in this book are generally reliable, but the statement that Cixi re-centralized power after decentralizing power is not entirely true. The decentralization of power at the end of the Qing Dynasty was due to the suppression of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement, when the Qing court was almost in danger of collapsing. Local governors supported the Qing court, and their power naturally grew. On the eve of the abdication, the royal family disregarded reality and had the idea and measures to re-centralize power, but the Qing court ultimately failed. So, how could the Empress Dowager Nala have been able to do anything about the decentralization and centralization of power? The translation of "Beijing Daily" (Peking Gazette) is also not true. The "Peking Gazette" only refers to the "Gongmen Chao."

### Reading "A Study of Planchette Superstition"

— Qian Dacheng

Written by Xu Dishan, published by Commercial Press

I have read "A Study of Planchette Superstition" three times and it seems I have a lot to say, but I am completely ignorant of spiritualism and psychology, so logically I have no right to comment. However, I believe that Mr. Xu's method of studying knowledge, especially the method of studying knowledge that is generally considered "trivial" or unworthy of attention, is worth introducing.

Planchette events are of course considered superstition by people who have received a scientific education, but the general ignorant men and women regard them as golden rules, which can guide people's confusion or predict people's misfortunes and blessings. Some people even use planchette to defraud others of money, and even more people use planchette to ridicule or intimidate people. Mr. Xu collected 132 planchette stories from the messy notes of past dynasties, and the result of his induction is that planchette is not the revelation of any gods, but merely the work of one's own mind.

Planchette Stories

At the same time, he further said: "Many planchette stories reflect the moral behavior and socio-political life of our nation. Scholars want to ask about their future before they have completed their studies, and they want to be lucky enough to know the questions before the exam. When they come out to work in the future, they have a fluke mentality in everything they do, and when things become impossible, they attribute it to fate... Officials are mostly corrupt, and they will create problems even when there is nothing to do, and small things will naturally be turned into big things. When handling official business, they also follow the same old routines, focusing on the literary aspects and not seeking practical benefits. As the story (109) indicates, the ghost of the Shaoxing scribe fully reflects the scene of the scribes' politics; the corruption of the bureaucracy affects the gods..." Ordinary people read notes as entertainment, and such books are fundamentally messy and disorganized, but after Mr. Xu's classification and collection, he actually came to such a conclusion. Starting from places that people don't pay attention to, cow urine, horse dung, and broken drum skin are all used as materials, truly turning decay into magic. Applying Mr. Xu's method of studying knowledge to the study of any big or small knowledge, I think we will definitely discover good results. Mr. Xu's research on the origin and development of planchette, as well as its explanation in spiritualism, is thorough and well-informed, so there is no room for supplementation.

Shadows in Yuewei Cottage

But many notes record the words of the planchette spirits, which seem to be the author's entrustment, using the planchette spirits to satirize society or teach people. Such facts are especially common in books such as "Shadows in Yuewei Cottage" and "Zi Bu Yu." Because in the autocratic era, people were simply not allowed to criticize state affairs or ridicule the authorities, it was natural for them to use the guise of gods to express their grievances. Mr. Xu seems to have not noticed this point.

Mr. Xu sighed in the end: "In recent decades, many people have received higher education and should have a special scientific attitude towards things. However, many of these people believe in planchette, which is a great sigh for the future of learning. Seeing more and more people gambling, I deeply sigh that the people of the country do not engage in intellectual efforts, and a large part of the reason is that they are not interested in learning and believe in fate in human affairs, and they worship blindly in faith. When the planchette spirits indicate opportunities for them, they can only wait with gambling behavior..." These words are indeed true. Chinese people often praise the devotion of Chinese and foreign scientists to religion, but what about themselves? They are just worshiping blindly, just for selfishness and seeking good fortune and avoiding disaster. How much do they understand about the true meaning of religion? Studying science is for one's own benefit, and worshiping religion is also just for one's own benefit. How many people have the lofty ambition to save others? That being said, planchette is indeed superstition, religion is also superstition, and why isn't science superstition too!

### Chekhov's "The Seagull"

— Lu Feiqiong

Written by Chekhov, translated by Li Ni, published by Cultural Life Press

Reading Chekhov's novels always gives one a feeling of melancholy, not only worrying about the era he lived in, but also re-evaluating "life" as a reader, and thus often feeling a kind of pressure after waking up. This situation is like suddenly waking up and finding oneself lying in an ice cellar, surrounded by extreme cold, making one feel lost and depressed.

I don't know who said this:

"What use is it for me, a dwarf, to have love, reason, will, and soul, in the face of people's eternal malice and eternal hatred?"

Today, when the remaining fallen leaves have been picked up and everything has been taken away, and the newborn sprouts are still suppressed under the rocks, do you not feel a little cold after reading Chekhov's works? Especially on rainy nights. In the distance, there is the melody of a blind man's sanxian, gradually weakening and disappearing in the dark atmosphere...

It is correct to say that Chekhov is a writer standing at the intersection of two eras. The victory of the new only appeared long after the author's death, so in his works, we can only be infected with too much twilight atmosphere and glimpse the tender sprouts of a fragile new life, although only a little, a little, but it is enough.

Chekhov is not as heroic as Gorky in the process of destruction and creation, but he is not as nihilistic as Artzybashev or Andreyev. He always murmurs softly and gently, but full of confidence and tenacious tone; he loves the future life, the future of mankind: —

"Good times are coming soon, then life will be as bright and happy as this Sunday morning——

But, we won't live to see it."

"But, we won't live to see it," Chekhov gave the most unbearable ending to another group of people who lacked confidence and were impatient to wait, that is, Ivanov and Treplev found their own way to destruction in the sound of gunfire.

In Chekhov's "The Seagull," Treplev is a typical example of the Russian intellectuals of the 1880s, "empty inside, panicking." He witnessed the contradictions and baseness of the old life. He hated the vulgar dialogue and scenes of the old drama. He wanted to call for the destruction of the old life. He wanted to express it in a new form, but he floated in the world of dreams and illusions. He had no definite goal. "Life has become a mysterious monster to him. In front of this monster, he is simply weak and at a loss." He was fascinated by the "chaotic state" of the chaotic period. He did not sensitively foresee the bright future. On the contrary, he saw the people in the "old life" that he was heartbroken for actually gaining fame and fortune and being triumphant. So, he was suppressed, and he finally ended his presumptuous life with his own hands.

Fortunately, Chekhov did not bring you too much melancholy. Beside the tombstones of the people who were suppressed, there were also thriving sprouts——

Nina, Treplev's lover, was as happy as a seagull, and was also destroyed by the hunter like a seagull. Here is a passage about her:

"A girl, just like you, lived by the lake all her life. She loved the lake like a seagull, and she was as free and happy as a seagull, but a passerby saw her and, with nothing else to do, destroyed her, just like this seagull that was shot dead here."

The writer Trigorin (he is drafting such a novel) said these words. It was also Trigorin who destroyed her. He is a famous and successful writer, that is, the writer whom Treplev cursed, who only knew how to write beautiful dreams and clichés. Two years later, when he returned to the countryside, someone gave him a specimen of a seagull and said that this was exactly what he had wanted two years ago, but he shook his head and said, "I don't remember," "I can't remember." The seagull, which could originally fly freely and happily, had its life destroyed by his unintentional blow, but he said indifferently: "I can't remember."

Having read this, you should hate the baseness of the "old life" as much as Treplev? But Chekhov did not want to make Nina fall down with Treplev. It was by no means accidental that he named the play "The Seagull". He wanted to discover the thriving sprouts in the song of this vibrant seagull, beside the tombstones of the fallen people. He believed that; "The cry of the seagull is not only a sad hope that is completely destroyed, but also a longing for a good life."

Treplev fell, but Nina tenaciously flew in the crowd. She wanted to live, to find the camp of the new generation, she said:

"...Bear your own cross and have faith. I have faith, so I can walk towards my own path." Yes, "I have faith", faith is sunshine, although the sun has never shone. But a tearful smile is already floating on her face, and her eyes have melted into that self-intoxicated joy.
