After inquiring about the local situation, the President delivered an impromptu speech, stating first that since Shaanxi Province suffered greatly from the devastation by the communist bandits after the Jing and Wei River Valley battles, he came to Xi'an personally to offer condolences. He then stated that the current suppression of the rebellion is by no means a purely military war, but rather requires the coordinated efforts of politics, economy, society, and military, to thoroughly implement total war, and only then can it be effective. Our social elites, especially comrades of our party, must go deep into society, lead the people, organize the people, and mobilize the power of the people to eliminate the communist bandits lurking in the localities, so that internal bandits will not arise and external bandits will not enter. Only in this way can the people truly live in peace and work happily, and the communist bandits can be thoroughly eradicated.

### A Tragic Picture of Inhumanity: A Pilgrimage to Kaifeng After the Calamity: The Essence Destroyed, Devastation Everywhere, Difficult to Restore to its Former Glory Within Thirty Years

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper in Kaifeng on the 27th] The reporter entered Bianyuan (Kaifeng) at 7:50 PM yesterday, following Chairman Liu Maoen, four hours after its recapture, and immediately inspected the urban area. The remaining people gathered along the road, and the sound of applause lasted for a long time. Bianyuan, after being bombarded by a week of fierce artillery fire and then devastated and looted for four days, has become dilapidated and is no longer the scene of two weeks ago. New graves are piled up near the levee outside the city, burying the loyal remains of our brave officers and soldiers and the innocent compatriots who were deceived by the treacherous bandits, numbering in the tens of thousands. Every bunker in the urban area is riddled with bullet holes, showing how tragic the Kaifeng defense battle was in those seven days. The reporter passed through Henan University, the Railway Bureau, the Post Office, the Power Plant, Tianfeng Flour Mill, Xiangguo Temple, the Yellow River Engineering Bureau, the Library, the Women's Normal School, etc., and the most prosperous section of Zhongzheng Road and Madao Street. In front of the large buildings on both sides, only broken walls and ruins were seen, and broken vehicles stood in the setting sun, adding a tragic and solemn atmosphere to this ancient city. Chairman Liu sighed incessantly as he directed the reporter's observation. The Danan Gate in the south of the city has been completely destroyed. The reporter smelled a strong stench of corpses passing through there, which made people cover their noses. The nearby streets were also filled with the smell of burning. The destroyed electric wires were intertwined with the rubble on the side of the road. The returning people, supporting the old and carrying the young, returned together. When they thought of their happy families, which had turned to ashes at once, their undisguised hatred for the treacherous bandits was evident. In the early hours of today, the reporter drove to Longting and the Provincial Government, the two places where the fighting was most intense, for inspection. Guns, cannons, bullets, soldiers' shoes and hats, and burned cars were scattered everywhere near Longting and the northern city wall, and the remains of soldiers and warhorses were still unburied, with flies and mosquitoes gathering. This tragic picture of inhumanity was created entirely by the treacherous bandits. The Provincial Government building was originally extremely magnificent, but now it has become a pile of rubble, with files and archives scattered on the ground. It will take at least thirty years to restore it to its former glory.

### Northern Ning Line Continuously Captures Strongholds Such as Anshan, War Situation in Eastern Hebei Has Stabilized, Two National Army Corps to Converge in Changli Today

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper in Tianjin on the 27th] The National Army from Tangshan to the east to relieve Changli is advancing rapidly along the railway. After capturing Shimen and Anshan stations on the 26th, it recovered Changli Station on the 27th and is pressing towards the county seat.

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper in Beiping on the 27th] Communist bandits on the Beining Railway are retreating north, and Shimen, Anshan, Liushouying, and Zhangjiazhuang have all been recovered. The battle on the outskirts of Qinhuangdao is still fierce. The air force dispatched planes all day long to bomb the bandits on the Qin (Qinhuangdao)-Fu (Ning)-Chang (Li)-Lu (Long) highway, and the bandits are gradually collapsing eastward.

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper in Qinhuangdao on the 27th] The war situation in eastern Hebei has stabilized due to the National Army's adoption of a pincer attack strategy from the east and west. The National Army advancing west from Beidaihe pointed directly at Liushouying on the 27th; the National Army coming east from Luan County captured Anshan on the 26th and pressed forward to Houfengtai on the 27th. The east and west National Army corps are scheduled to converge in Changli on the 28th. The bandits in Changli City are using more than 200 large carts to transport the plundered materials to Nanmajiayu in Funing. There are not many bandits in the city now, and the National Army's convergence tomorrow may be smooth. According to more than 200 traffic police and county police who broke out of Changli to Qin Island today, the bandits used eight brigades to attack Changli, suffering heavy casualties.

The main target of the bandits' offensive this time was Qinhuangdao. The unit responsible for this task was Lin bandit's 11th Column. On the night of the 23rd, the bandits used one division to attack Beidaihe, and two divisions were placed between Beidaihe and Qin Island, intending to block the National Army on the way when the National Army in Qin Island came to aid Beidaihe, and to attack Qin Island at the same time. Another unit of Nie bandit attacked Changli and Luanping, and then went west to Guye and Tangshan. As a result, because the National Army's steps were stable and reinforcements were rapid, the bandits' plan has been largely defeated. If the National Army continues to have reinforcements, the bandits will quickly retreat north.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Bridge No. 14, which was previously destroyed between Jinxihe and Chadian in the Jintang section of the Beining Railway, and Bridge No. 54, which was destroyed between Caojiadian and Leizhuang in the Tangying section, have been repaired on the 27th, and it is expected that traffic will be restored to Luan County on the 28th.

### General Budget Proposal for the Second Half of this Year: The Executive Yuan to Submit to the Legislative Yuan Today: Salt Tax Will be Adjusted According to the Price Index

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 27th] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold the 16th meeting of the first session on the morning of the 29th, and the national general budget proposal for the second half of the 37th year will be discussed at the meeting on July 2nd.

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 27th] The salt tax rate will be adjusted, and a method of calculating it according to the price index will be implemented. The tax rate calculated according to the price index is the first type for salt tax. It is heard that the principle of this method has been decided and will be implemented in the near future. It is learned that the amount of salt tax revenue before the war was extremely large, averaging six yuan per unit, and the total revenue was only below customs duties, exceeding direct taxes and commodity taxes. Now, with the currency value depreciating daily, the salt tax is collected from the east, and although it has been adjusted repeatedly, the revenue collected has been relatively reduced year by year. In order to enrich tax revenue, the competent authorities plan to implement a method of calculation according to the index, stipulating the base number of salt tax, and calculating it monthly according to the latest monthly national wholesale price index announced by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The salt tax base number set is much lower than the average salt tax rate before the war. In addition to exempting industrial salt from tax, agricultural pesticide salt was originally the same rate as fish salt tax, and it is now also planned to exempt it from tax. Specially permitted exports and imports of salt may also be exempted from tax with the approval of the Executive Yuan. When there is a change in the monthly wholesale price index, adjustments will not be made if the increase or decrease is within 20%. All of these measures are intended to increase treasury revenue while still avoiding a dramatic increase in the people's burden.

### Chow Yih-der Praises Dewey's Views: Advocates Expanding Military Aid to China: Hopes to Appoint Wedemeyer or Bullitt as Envoy to China Instead

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Republican Congressman Chow Yih-der, who advocates full aid to China, said that he "firmly believes" that once Dewey is elected president, the United States will have a "sound and consistent" aid to China plan. He acknowledged that Dewey has the clearest view of China.

Chow advocated a military aid plan that would allow U.S. military officers to have direct contact with Chinese troops on the front lines, a plan similar to the U.S. aid to Greece. He said: "I believe that the Republican Party will be in power after January 20, so this aid to China plan will be the government's policy at that time." He pointed out that Dewey's Secretary of State is most likely to be Sheers, a Republican foreign policy authority. Dooles' grandfather, Forster, served as Secretary of State in 1892 and established the foundation for China's Open Door Policy.

Chow also said that Dewey advocates economic aid to China of at least $250 million per year for a period of three years, in addition to military assistance. Dewey supports transferring the surplus war equipment on the Pacific islands to China and stabilizing China's monetary system. Chow stressed that China also needs to receive technical assistance and supplies.

Chow Yih-der condemned Marshall, saying that his appointment of Stuart as ambassador was nothing more than to please the Chinese Communist Party, and hoped that the government would appoint Lieutenant General Wedemeyer to succeed him as envoy. If the government does not nominate Wedemeyer, then former Ambassador to France Bullitt should be appointed instead.

Chow Yih-der said: "If China can create a miracle and hold on until January 20, then the Republican Party can be expected to take power at that time, and the situation can still be saved. Before that, if Wedemeyer or Bullitt is appointed as envoy to China, there is still hope."

Chow criticized the idea of appointing a career diplomat to China, saying that Marshall's "drifting" policy would continue indefinitely. According to diplomatic circles, although the State Department has tried its best to insist that the ambassador's resignation has not yet been approved, it is speculated that due to the difficulty of finding talent, career personnel may take over during the transition period.

If a career diplomat is to be appointed as envoy to China, John Stron, the current Consul General in Singapore, may be appointed to this position. Stron served in China for many years before World War II, returned to China in 1945 as Consul General in Shanghai, and is currently 63 years old. He is a Far Eastern career diplomat and is highly favored by the State Department.

Editorial

### Emergency Measures Regarding Prices

The four emergency measures regarding prices in this city have been discussed and decided upon for implementation by the Party authorities. Among them, the investigation of warehouses and the investigation of daily necessities transactions are particularly important in nature. Various parties have long proposed these measures, but the authorities have been particularly cautious due to the complexity of the situation. The results of this consultation have finally led to resolute implementation. Undoubtedly, this is due to the pressing need of the objective environment.

Shanghai is a major industrial metropolis. Its life is entirely dependent on various economic activities, and so-called transactions and storage are important acts in economic activities. To protect the legitimate interests of the industrial and commercial sectors, especially when national industry is on the verge of collapse, unless there are clear legal provisions and prohibitions, all unexpected disturbances should be reduced as much as possible to avoid any adverse effects. Therefore, although the aforementioned emergency measures may have their unavoidable needs in the current objective environment, in order to reduce abuses and stabilize public sentiment, deep attention must be paid to their implementation.

The city government's order to investigate warehouses contains the words, "In order to clarify the quantity of daily necessities stored in various warehouses, so as to plan as a whole, adjust surpluses and deficiencies, and thereby stabilize market prices," and stipulates that the types of investigation are limited to nine categories, including cotton, yarn, cloth, vegetable oil, rice, flour, fuel (kerosene, coal, charcoal), paper, and miscellaneous grains. The items are the same when investigating daily necessities transactions. From this, we can know: (1) the scope of the investigation originally had a fixed limit; (2) its function is to plan as a whole and adjust surpluses and deficiencies; (3) the investigation of transactions is to crack down on speculation, manipulation, and hoarding for profit, which has a certain legal basis. Therefore, we hope that the executing agencies will recognize these goals, handle matters according to law, and avoid excessive entanglements within the possible scope in order to stabilize the market. Merchants who have no speculation, manipulation, or hoarding activities can truthfully declare and do not need to be apprehensive. People who have no relationship with the above nine types of businesses should not be interfered with.

Here are a few more suggestions to put forward to everyone:

First, investigating inventory takes a lot of time. Whether it is in reporting, verification, or calculation, these procedures cannot be completed in a short period of time. There is a past example of checking enemy and puppet materials as proof. And what exactly are the methods planned by the authorities for overall planning and adjusting surpluses and deficits? Will considerable preparation be required during implementation? This cannot be achieved without sufficient time. Therefore, while investigating and planning overall, it must also be allowed to circulate normally to maintain the market. Otherwise, the so-called overall planning will turn into complete suffocation, and some of the daily necessities stored in various warehouses may become moldy enemy and puppet materials.

Second, warehouses are places for storing goods and also hubs for goods to enter and exit. Goods already stored should be allowed to report their movement, and goods not yet stored should also be allowed to freely enter, with each warehouse submitting supplementary reports at any time to complete the procedures. The authorities should supplement this point with a statement to avoid transportation merchants from hearing and hesitating, and manufacturers from having many concerns. We also hope that the authorities will announce the content of the overall planning and adjustment of surpluses and deficits as soon as possible to dispel public doubts. Otherwise, if the source is not smooth and the inventory becomes increasingly depleted, this is certainly not a proper measure to stabilize the economy. If only the existing materials in each warehouse are planned and adjusted as a whole, its effectiveness may be limited, and its sustainability will be questionable.

Third, speculation, manipulation, and hoarding for profit are obvious facts to everyone. If they are not thoroughly investigated and punished according to law, it will certainly not be enough to curb the rising prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. However, many such cases have been cracked in the past, and the results are often loud thunder but little rain. The more flamboyant the scene, the more vague the result, and the vast majority of those who hoard in large quantities and speculate in large quantities are people with such backgrounds. They use many companies as tools, they use huge funds as stakes, and they use many fashionable names as shields for open hoarding. We believe that they should bear most of the responsibility for the current soaring prices and the chaos in the market. If the authorities really want to crack down on speculation and severely punish hoarding, they should not avoid suspicion or resentment and quickly start from these places in order to suppress prices and quell public anger. If they act as they have in the past, simply grabbing a few small merchants and civilians at random to settle the accounts, what benefit will this have for stabilizing prices? And what effect will it actually have on speculation, manipulation, and hoarding for profit? It will only further deepen the centrifugal force of the people and further degrade the government's credibility.

The main reason why prices are soaring so much now, apart from speculation and hoarding, is what everyone knows, which is entirely due to the excessive expansion of currency and the continued unlimited expansion. This is also what the authorities do not deny. Then, the fundamental solution of prescribing the right medicine for the disease should undoubtedly start from this. Everything else is either self-comforting or a temporary fix. Experience has shown that any minor measures are ineffective. This fundamental plan is beyond the ability of the local authorities, and they can only sigh helplessly. But since the crux of the problem has been clearly understood without any doubt, it seems unwise to overemphasize all insincere evasions and laborious and unrewarding plans. If there is strength, sincerity, and a real desire to flatten prices, then striving to assist the central government, increasing revenue, reducing expenditure, and contracting currency is the proper way. This is not deliberately demanding too much of the local authorities, nor is it ignoring their efforts, but the price problem today is too serious and too profound. The measures of mending a leaky pot are certainly not effective.

### After the Announcement of New Economic Measures, Prices in Tianjin Fall Across the Board. Changchun Implements a Thorough Investigation of Hoarders.

[Our newspaper, Tianjin, 27th] After the National Bank representative announced the new economic measures in Tianjin, prices fell across the board on the 27th, with flour falling by 3 million per bag and yarn falling by 180 million per piece.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Xia Jinxiong, Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, and Li Lixia, Director of the Auditing Department, negotiated with relevant parties all day on the 27th regarding the technical issues of selling materials. It has been decided to sell a large quantity of grain in the grain market starting on the morning of the 28th. Tianjin grain merchants have been selling their inventory after hearing the news, and grain prices have generally fallen. Other goods have also weakened accordingly.

### Jiangdu Holds Price-Stabilized Grain Sales

[Our newspaper, Jiangdu, 27th] The price of early-season rice in this county has risen as high as 20 million, and the supply is scarce.

[Our newspaper, Jiangdu, 27th] The supply of military conscripts in this county is frequent, and the temporary expense difference of the Pacification Headquarters reaches 5 billion per month. After consultation between relevant authorities, it was decided to levy a miscellaneous grain business donation starting today, with a tax rate of 9 per mille, in order to make up for it. Councilor Zhu Ganchen was publicly elected as the head of the Military-Civilian Cooperation Station, responsible for the supply of military conscripts.

### Early-Season Rice Completely Hidden Away, The Beiping Municipal Government Will Thoroughly Investigate.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The 27th was a Sunday, and gold and foreign currencies did not fluctuate greatly, only slightly stronger than the 26th. However, rice prices continued to rise. The price of early-season rice outside the city reached 17.2 million (the negotiated price on the 26th was 15 million), and the selling price inside the city exceeded 20 million.

### Changzhou Implements Public Sales of Rice

[Our newspaper, Wujin, 27th] The market was extremely chaotic on Saturday. The price of top-quality white rice broke through the 20 million mark, and the highest underground interest rate reached 80%, causing public unrest. Over a hundred poor people gathered in front of the Yang Dasheng Tongchang rice factories, all showing signs of rice snatching. Fortunately, military police arrived in time to stop them and ordered them to line up for supply from the factory, buying two liters of rice per person at a price of 140,000 per liter, which calmed the situation. Only the Zhang Yongtai Rice Shop had a small dispute, damaging one or two mouthfuls of rice. Starting today, the grain industry will set up eight public rice sales offices throughout the city, limiting each person to two liters at a fixed price publicly announced. Door-to-door sales by various rice factories will be temporarily suspended. The price-stabilized rice allocated will still be supplied as usual. Local figures such as Guo Yaozong and others have proposed fourteen emergency measures to curb the rising trend, suggesting that the county government implement the main points, which are to close the yarn and gold market and strictly crack down on illegal transactions. The gold and yarn market stopped trading today, and the situation has stabilized. The money supply has suddenly tightened, and the people eagerly hope that the government will come up with a solution.

### The Flooding in Linsen County, Fujian Province is Severe: The County's Vitality Has Suffered Enormous Damage, Recovery is Unlikely for Half a Century.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th] The flood damage suffered by Linsen County, adjacent to Fuzhou, far exceeds that of Fuzhou. According to investigations, only two of the county's forty townships escaped the disaster, while the rest were completely submerged by floods. The heaviest losses were in five areas: rice paddies, fish ponds, embankments, fruit trees, and clam flats, with a total value of several trillion. Since the evening of the 16th, floods have inundated the county and have not yet fully receded. Of the county's 540,000 mu of farmland, the most severely damaged area is over 180,000 mu. The loss of early rice alone has reached 720,000 dan. All the fish in the county's 300-odd fish ponds were washed away, with a loss of 300,000 large fish. The Da Wen Dam in Xifu Township was completely destroyed. From now on, even ordinary water flow will wash away the rice fields. The loss of olive trees and peach trees in Xiongzhong and Xi townships and the loss of mandarin orange trees in Nan Township were also severe. From now on, the nationally renowned Fuzhou olives, mandarin oranges, and honey peaches will no longer be one of Fujian Province's export products. Each of the county's thirty large clam flats contained an average of about 100,000 dan of clams, all of which have been destroyed. In addition to the above five items, four sections of highway were washed away. It is even more difficult to calculate the loss of livestock, furniture, and residential materials. The number of victims is over 400,000, and the vitality has suffered enormous damage, which is unlikely to be recovered for half a century.

### Sichuan's Self-Defense Training Program: Training 3 Million Soldiers in Half a Year.

### Proposal of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly: Request the Issuance of Provincial Dime Notes

[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 27th] Since the opening of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, 204 proposals have been received as of yesterday. Important ones include: (1) Please abolish the transportation control system and abolish the Gold Control Bureau. (2) Please allow Guangdong Province to issue provincial dime notes on its own. (3) Send a telegram to oppose the United States supporting Japan. (4) Urge Hong Kong to fulfill the agreement and not harbor our traitors.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th] At the fourth session of the first Guangdong Provincial Assembly this morning, the work reports of the central government's resident agencies in Guangdong were reviewed. When reviewing the work report of the Guangzhou Gold Control Bureau, all councilors unanimously launched fierce attacks, believing that the bureau had condoned silver and money houses buying foreign currency and gold, creating social unrest. They urged the Pacification Headquarters to send more military police to strictly prohibit the buying and selling of gold notes. Councilor Li Jiong immediately pointed out four instances of corruption in the loan factories of the Guangzhou branch of the Four Joint Offices. Finally, it was unanimously advocated that councilors should be sent to cooperate with the Supervisory Office of Guangdong and Guangxi to thoroughly investigate and request the government to severely punish.

### Hong Kong and Guangzhou Speculative Organizations Forging Passports to the United States

A Letter from the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce Exposes the Scam

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] It is reported that there is a speculative organization in the Hong Kong and Guangzhou area that specializes in forging passports and birth certificates to sell to merchants or students who want to go to the United States and South America. The Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Venezuela in South America recently issued a warning, sending a letter to the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Recently, many Chinese have purchased forged passports in Hong Kong and traveled to South America, only to be rejected at the border. These forged documents were purchased for $1,700." The letter requested the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce to cooperate fully to eradicate this illegal organization in order to avoid unnecessary losses in money and time. It has been rumored for some time that many Chinese students have come south to Hong Kong with the intention of going to the United States. Here, they can purchase a birth certificate for 500 Hong Kong dollars and go to the United States as a British subject. It is difficult to distinguish the authenticity of this document. The birth certificates issued by the British authorities do not have photos attached, and it is easy for those who engage in speculative trading to find people with the same name, gender, and age to meet the needs of employers.

### Repairing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Trains Pass After the Water Recedes

Recently, he also hoarded hundreds of bags of flour and a large number of electrical materials in Baoding. After being reported in Beiping recently, he has been detained by the Baoding Garrison Headquarters. The case involves a wide range of people, and Xu will be sent to Beiping for legal proceedings within a few days.

### A Slowly Exploding Atomic Bomb (Part 2)

— Wu Jiatang

Other political reforms eliminated the feudal police state characteristics of Japan's past. The abolition of the Home Ministry was one such important measure. This ministry was the core of Japan's past political power, established in 649 AD, making it the oldest department in the Japanese government. After the implementation of the Meiji Constitution in 1868, it became the most important ministry in the Japanese government. The four most powerful institutions within the Home Ministry, whose power was so great that it directly affected the smallest aspect of people's daily lives, were the Shrine Bureau, the Local Administration Bureau, the Police Affairs Bureau, and the National Land Bureau. In fact, the four bureaus of the Home Ministry in the past controlled all public and private life of the Japanese people from birth to death. The Shrine Bureau dominated the religious beliefs of the Japanese people, which was a tool to bind the spirit of the Japanese people. At the same time, the government, through this Shinto religious organization, instilled nationalism and militarism into the people's consciousness. In the past, more than 100,000 shrines in Japan were under the jurisdiction of the Home Ministry. Senior monks were civil servants and directly under the command of the ministry. Therefore, the spiritual and religious education of the Japanese people was indeed entirely controlled by the government before the defeat.

Through the Local Administration Bureau, the Home Ministry controlled everything, large and small, in local governments. In the past, there was no real local autonomy in Japan. The governors were appointed by the Home Ministry, and the heads of each province then appointed the governors of each prefecture and other local officials. At the same time, the Home Ministry had the power to dissolve local councils. Because the Home Ministry ruled local officials and held the power of life and death, the Home Minister was truly the emperor of Japan's domestic affairs in the past.

Another major task of the Local Administration Bureau in the past was to manage elections in Japan. Its control was absolute. The Home Ministry controlled national elections, and the heads of provinces and prefectural governors managed local elections. Even at the beginning of Japan's parliamentary system, the Home Minister manipulated elections in many ways. In the years after 1920, Japan's party system developed to a high degree, but the ruling party often used the controlling power of the Home Ministry to manipulate elections.

Japan also had an organization similar to our country's Baojia system, which was also ordered to be abolished by the Allied General Headquarters. This system emphasized mobilization during the war and carried out the most stringent surveillance of the Japanese people.

The most decisive change was the reorganization of the Japanese police system. Before the war, the police were a major department of the Japanese Home Ministry. From the July 7th Incident to the end of the war, the police implemented the most brutal control in Japan. They used legal and illegal means to eliminate untamed elements. Some people were imprisoned for several years without ever formally providing evidence of a crime to the judicial authorities. Those who have lived in the occupied areas of China know the crimes of the Japanese police particularly well. Since the Allied forces occupied Japan, the Japanese police have undergone thorough reorganization. Special Higher Police, ideological police, and economic police have all been abolished. The current total number of Japanese police is 125,000. Those who had served in the old Baojia system were not allowed to be employed. The Allied General Headquarters also established a police academy, specializing in recruiting new people and teaching them the basic knowledge of democratic policing. Anyone related to the past police bureau was also rejected. The police's armed force is limited to 25,000 Japanese pistols. Currently, some people accuse the current number of Japanese police of being higher than the officially published figures before the occupation. This is true. However, in the past, ideological police, secret police, military police, special higher police, and economic police all performed "police" duties and were not included in the officially published police figures, but their numbers were several times higher than the number of Japanese police under the control of the Allied General Headquarters.

The third slowly exploding atomic bomb is the ongoing liquidation work in Japan today. According to the Potsdam Declaration, the occupying authorities are responsible for "permanently eliminating those who deceived and led the Japanese people to embark on the conquest of the world, so that their authority and influence can be permanently eliminated." The implementation of the liquidation policy has shaken the entire political foundation of Japan's past. "Liquidation" may be the most terrifying term in Japan, and the gradual formation of its basic policies and plans will be discussed in another article.

### The Situation in Berlin Turns Relaxed; The Soviet Union Decides to Allow the Resumption of Food Supply; Marshall Studies the Possibility of Reopening the Four Foreign Ministers Conference

[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] The tense situation in Berlin has eased due to the Soviet Union's decision to allow food to be imported from the Soviet zone into the British, American, and French sectors of Berlin starting on the 28th, and the decision of the British and American authorities to airlift 3,000 pounds of food daily to supply the western sector of Berlin. Observers believe that the Soviet decision to resume food supply is due to the firm stance taken by the Western countries.

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Secretary of State Marshall, who has been examining his health in the Army Hospital here for a week, will return to work tomorrow and will devote all his efforts to studying the Berlin situation. American officials believe that the Soviet Union's actions in Berlin may not be without the possibility of promoting a four-country foreign ministers conference. Although the Berlin situation is extremely serious, officials from both the State Department and the Department of Defense still hope that the differences between the Soviet Union and the Western countries can be resolved and that there is no real danger of war. If the Soviet Union is sincere in resolving the practical problems of Germany, the United States is also willing to do so seriously. However, Marshall has no sign of meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Bidault at present. If the four foreign ministers conference is resumed, the Soviet Union must also make concessions and first hold a foreign ministers representative conference.

[Reuters, London, 26th] Well-informed sources here claim that Britain, the United States, and France will soon directly present a joint note to Moscow to negotiate the Soviet Union's blockade of the western sector of Berlin. Up to now, the Western countries have only contacted the Soviet Union's representatives in Berlin, and have not directly negotiated with Moscow. Due to the sensitivity of the Berlin situation, it is expected that the Western occupying countries will intensify their efforts to establish a West German government. The heads of the three Western occupying military governments are scheduled to meet with West German leaders next week to discuss the establishment of a West German constituent assembly.

### The French President Calls for Peace; Hopes to Abandon the Use of Force to Resolve Disputes

[Reuters, Sabdang, French-Belgian border, 27th] French President Auriol arrived here from Paris and delivered a speech to a large crowd, earnestly appealing for peace in Europe again. He said that the most urgent need in France and abroad is peace. Europe is now facing a new crisis, and the only way to avoid it is to abandon the use of force to resolve disputes. The Berlin crisis makes people believe that European peace is only hanging by a thread, but war must not be allowed to happen again. We must organize peace at home and abroad, and abolish the idea of war in order to solve the current problems.

[United Press, Paris, 26th] During a closed-door meeting of the French Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee today, Foreign Minister Bidault responded to questions from Communist Party member Pondet and said that France is willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve the Berlin crisis, but France does not want to take the initiative. At the same time, Premier Schumann will convene a cabinet meeting on the morning of the 28th to discuss the international situation, especially the German issue and the Marshall Plan.

### The United States is Willing to Negotiate with the Soviet Union to Restore Trade in the Occupied Zones

Clay Sends a Letter to the Soviet Military Commander

[France Press, Berlin, 26th] American military commander Clay wrote to Soviet military commander Sokolovsky, stating that the American authorities are still willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union in order to restore commercial relations with the Soviet occupied zone. The letter also attached a copy of the currency reform law announced by the two zones on June 26th. Clay's letter said, "In the letter of June 18th, we sincerely stated that we are willing to continue commercial relations with the Soviet zone. Today, we tell you again that we are prepared to meet with you to discuss the plans necessary to maintain commercial relations between our occupied zones. We are still willing to meet with you today in order to achieve this goal."

### The German Socialist Unity Party Plans to Launch a General Strike

Protesting the Use of the New Currency in Berlin

[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] With the consent of the Soviet military government, the Communist-controlled German Socialist Unity Party has prepared a plan to launch a general strike in Berlin to protest the Western Allies' use of the Deutsche Mark in Berlin and demand recognition of the East German Mark as the only currency in Berlin.

### Berlin Residents Face Famine; A Hundred American Planes Airlift Food for Relief

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] More than 100 American Air Force transport planes will take off from Frankfurt on Monday to transport food and important supplies to the western sector of Berlin. When announcing this news, an American Air Force spokesman also said that this number is only a part of the large number of planes that the Air Force may be required to allocate for transportation. This is the first countermeasure taken by the Western Allies since the Soviet Union blockaded the western sector of Berlin on Thursday. American military government officials also said that the food and supplies transported by this giant airlift will be used to supply Germans and occupying forces in the western sector of Berlin.

[This newspaper] London, 27th broadcast: Berlin news, the British and American military authorities in Germany decided to impose strict restrictions on the consumption of food and daily necessities for soldiers and civilians in the British and American sectors of Berlin in order to reduce the burden of the air force transporting food to Berlin.

### The Soviet Union Purchases Large Quantities of Rubber; Suspected War Preparations

[Central News Agency, London, 26th, United Press] There is much speculation here about the Soviet Union's large-scale purchase of rubber in London, and it is believed that the Soviet Union is stockpiling the most important war materials. It is reported that the Soviet Union has purchased a total of 20,000 tons of rubber so far, and the amount purchased in recent weeks has been particularly large. The Manchester Guardian pointed out that all sectors in London have "a heavy feeling of unease about the Soviet Union's large-scale purchase of rubber," and recalled that Germany had also purchased war materials in London a few days before launching the war. The newspaper continued, the Soviet Union's move may also be due to Moscow's prediction that prices will rise. The recent rise in prices of some goods in the London market is not unrelated to the Soviet Union's purchase. At present, the Soviet Union's contracts for rubber have already scheduled shipments until October of this year. Most of the goods will be exported from Malaya, but all purchasing procedures are handled in London.

### The Polish Foreign Minister Reports to the Parliament on the Warsaw Conference; Emphasizes that the Western Border Will Not Be Allowed to Change

[Reuters, Warsaw, 27th] Polish Foreign Minister Modzelewski addressed the parliament today, reporting on the East European Eight Foreign Ministers Conference, and declared that it has been decided that under any circumstances, Poland's western border will not be allowed to change. The Slavic countries believe that it is necessary to establish an agreement on East Germany, so the Warsaw Conference was convened, and now this agreement has been obtained.

In order to please Germany, the Western European countries are willing to sacrifice their friendship with the Soviet Union, and it is expected that they will try to change the status of Poland's western border in the near future. After discussion at the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Slavic countries, it has been decided that Poland's western border is a permanent border, and under no circumstances will any changes be allowed.

Strive for Peace Together; Establishing East Germany is Absurd

The Polish Foreign Minister continued, the rumor that the Slavic countries have established East Germany is purely absurd. The aspiration of the Slavic countries is only peace in Europe. All actions in Germany should be jointly adopted by the four powers. The Slavic countries will never engage in explosive unilateral actions, only the Western countries have always acted arbitrarily. The Warsaw Conference is a stage for striving for peace and promoting progress, and is a true expression of the Slavic countries' peaceful aspirations.

Regarding the most-favored-nation point, it will be determined by the exchange of letters between the United States and various countries. It is heard that Italy and Norway are expected to be the first countries to sign border agreements with the United States.

### Communist Parties in Southeast Asia Actively Launch Activities

Bangkok Has Become a Communist Espionage Center

[Reuters, London, 27th] A summary of reports from correspondents from Reuters in Southeast Asia shows that the Communist Party is engaged in various forms and degrees of activities in this region with a population of 150 million and an area of 1 million square miles. Reuters' Singapore correspondent reported that he had witnessed documentary evidence that the Communist Party had a plan to occupy the entire territory of the Federation of Malaya by revolutionary means, and that the recent terrorist activities in the Malay Peninsula were only the beginning. A five-member group in Bangkok, under the cover of the Southeast Asia League, is actually the espionage center of the Communist Party in the Southeast Asia region. These five people are composed of one representative each from the Communist Parties of Australia, Annam, India, Malaya, and Burma. Reuters' Batavia correspondent also reported that the failure of the Indonesian Republic's negotiations with the Netherlands has led to the activeness of extremist revolutionaries. The Soviet Union's exchange of consuls with the Indonesian Republic is an even greater victory for the Soviet Union.

### Bernadotte Has Drafted a New Holy Land Peace Plan; It Can Be Submitted to the Arabs and Jews Before Wednesday

[Reuters, Rhodes Island, 27th] Bernadotte said here: He has completed the peace plan for Palestine, and it can be submitted to both the Jewish and Arab sides by Wednesday at the latest. Before it is accepted or rejected, the content must be kept strictly confidential. But he is extremely optimistic and confident that this plan is the best solution for Palestine.

The reason he is optimistic is because he is convinced that neither the Jewish nor the Arab side is willing to be judged by world public opinion as the identity of a war instigator. When asked about Egypt's violation of the truce, Bernadotte said that the United Nations Headquarters has received an apology from the Egyptian government and believes that this incident was not intentional, but if it happens again, it will inevitably create a serious situation. Bernadotte also said that he believes that the Arab protest against the Soviet Union's exchange of diplomatic representatives with Israel is unjustified.

### Revising the Municipal Government Organization Regulations; The Executive Yuan Will Discuss and Decide This Week; The Total Number of Personnel is Limited to 2,700; Financial Revenue and Expenditure Should Seek Self-Balancing and Should Not Rely on Subsidies

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Shanghai Municipal Government Organization Regulations will now be revised again, and it is expected to be submitted for discussion and decision at the Executive Yuan's weekly meeting next week. This revision is in response to the Shanghai Municipal Government's request. After the original organization regulations were approved by the Executive Yuan, the Shanghai Municipal Government stated that the scope of its jurisdiction was broad, the business it managed was heavy, and the local situation was particularly complex. The organization approved by the Executive Yuan was too small and the number of personnel was too small. Therefore, it submitted an amendment requesting that the originally approved nine bureaus and eighty-seven sections be changed to nine bureaus and one hundred and twenty sections, and the originally approved 2,451 people be increased to 3,315 people. After the Executive Yuan handed it over to the Ministry of the Interior to invite relevant agencies to consult, the compromise opinions put forward mainly included: (1) The number of sections proposed to be revised by the Shanghai Municipal Government can be approved, except that the Public Works Bureau is reduced to twelve sections and the Public Utilities Bureau is reduced to ten sections. (2) No deputy directors should be set up in each bureau. The municipal government should independently consider and allocate the total number of personnel to each bureau and office within the limit of not exceeding 2,700 people. (3) There should be as much reduction as possible in the number of simplified and recommended personnel. Specialized committee members do not need to be changed to simplified dispatches and should still be listed as employed. (4) The duties of the Public Works Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau should be appropriately revised. (5) Shanghai's financial income is currently 70% spent on employee living allowances. If living allowances increase daily in the future, income will be difficult to meet expenditure. The Shanghai Municipal Government should be ordered to seek self-balancing of revenue and expenditure and not rely on central subsidies.

Duties of the Public Works Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau

In addition, opinions for revision have also been put forward regarding the duties of the Public Works Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau. (A) Public Works Bureau: (1) Investigation and design of urban planning, (2) Planning, construction, maintenance of road and ditch projects. (3) Planning and construction of bridge markers, tunnels, wharves, and embankment projects. (4) Management of river and water conservancy projects.

### Resumption of Silver Shops Expected

[Our Newspaper's Report] The long-awaited issue of the resumption of silver shops is now likely to be realized.

### List of Special Relief Donations: Not to be Released in the Short Term

[Our Newspaper's Report] The special relief donation collection in this city has not yet achieved good results.

It is now learned that the authorities, at the request of various industry associations, have requested that the list be kept confidential temporarily for the convenience of fundraising. The association has now established several groups, each responsible for urging a unit or group to submit the pledged amount as soon as possible. If the payment is overdue or deliberately delayed, their names will still be announced.

### Labor Union's Suggestion: Evaluate Hotel Room Rates
Yesterday's Report to Various Sectors

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Hotel Industry Labor Union of this city yesterday hosted the heads of party and government agencies, labor councilors, and the press, including Director Fang Zhi of the Municipal Party Department, Chief Secretary Pan Zhongjia of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Shui Xiangyun of the Federation of Trade Unions, Councilors Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Shao Yongsheng, and reporters from various newspapers, a total of more than 20 people. The chairman of the labor union, Du Yaying, reported that the hotel industry recently requested the City Council to abolish the price limit on room rates and implement free pricing. The labor union also expressed sympathy for this request. However, the labor and management sides had an agreement stipulating that the salaries of employees would increase or decrease in proportion to the room rates. Therefore, an inseparable relationship has developed between room rates and wages. If free pricing of room rates is implemented, the pricing of room rates in various hotels will inevitably vary due to business competition, which will inevitably cause labor cost issues. Therefore, it is suggested that after the room rate limit system is abolished, a room rate evaluation agency should be organized. In addition to labor and management representatives, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Council should be invited to participate. The room rates produced by the evaluation should be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, so that the sale price of room rates can be avoided. At the same time, it was also reported that the hotel industry had established a labor-management cooperation promotion association to actively promote various welfare undertakings.

The Heroic Bearing of New Recruits in Their Posts (Photo by Our Newspaper)

### Garrison Command Hosts Reporters to Visit Jiangwan East Barracks; New Recruits of Good Quality, Full of Spirit, and Enjoying Life; Petition to Change the Second Installment of Resettlement Allowance to In-Kind Distribution

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the recruitment of new recruits for Shanghai City in 1948 began, 1,860 people have entered the camp, all concentrated in the Jiangwan East Barracks for training. In order to allow all sectors to understand their living conditions, the Garrison Command Headquarters specially hosted Chinese and foreign reporters from this city to visit yesterday afternoon, led by Commander Fu Zhengmo himself, touring for a week, and participating in the meal of all officers and soldiers.

The barracks were formerly Japanese military barracks. The barracks are spacious and clean, and the light and air are sufficient. The connected wooden bunk beds are about one foot off the ground, with no dampness. Some are even canvas cots. The housekeeping is extremely neat and clean. The quilts and blankets are folded into squares, and even the smallest items, such as towels and shoes, are placed in a fixed location. The kitchen and toilet are also very clean.

Various Activities with Great Interest

After the new recruits enter the camp, each person is issued three sets of clothing, one felt blanket, and two pairs of shoes and socks. The meals are provided according to the regulations of 25 ounces of rice per person per day. The vegetable fee is adjusted regularly, and is currently 960,000 yuan per person per month, with two meals a day. The daily life starts at 5:00 AM and goes to bed at 8:30 PM, with four hours of outdoor technical training and four hours of indoor lectures. The rest of the time is for entertainment, reading, exercise, and rest. They are all very strong, with rosy complexions, full of spirit. The reporters witnessed their various activities such as playing basketball, high jumping, singing Peking opera, wrestling games, and publishing wall newspapers, all with great interest, with no signs of depression or suffering. When asked how they were living after entering the camp, whether they were getting enough to eat, and how the officers treated them, they all replied with sincere smiles: "Life is very good, we are getting enough to eat, and the officers do not abuse us at all."

Transfer to Taiwan for Long-Term Training

According to an investigation, their educational level is: 67 high school students, 200 junior high school students, 400 higher elementary school students, 758 lower elementary school students, 141 with basic literacy, and 304 illiterate. Background: 1 person who has worked in telecommunications, 400 workers, 700 farmers, 145 students, 425 businessmen, 3 police officers, 13 government officials, 1 transportation worker, and 17 others. 155 were originally soldiers. Their places of origin are mostly from Zhejiang, followed by Jiangsu, and there are also people from Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces. 930 people are classified as Grade A in terms of physical condition, 761 as Grade B, and 161 as Grade C. Based on the above, the quality of this batch of new recruits can be said to be quite good. They will soon be transferred to General Sun Liren in Taiwan for short-term training.

Family Issues and Worries

However, they are currently unable to fully devote themselves to the country due to the resettlement allowance issue. The standard for the resettlement allowance is 20 piculs of white rice per person. The Military Service Association distributes it in two installments based on the legally converted price of rationed rice. The first half is issued upon entering the camp. Those who entered the camp in May have each received 35 million yuan, and those who entered the camp in June have each received 50 million yuan. The second installment is issued upon transfer. The Military Service Association recently planned to issue 50 million yuan per person in advance, but all the new recruits believe that due to the soaring prices in recent days, 50 million yuan is not enough to buy three piculs of rice. How can their families maintain their lives? They still have worries, so they refuse to accept it and request to be given in-kind distribution. When the reporters visited yesterday, Fang Zhi, Director of the Municipal Party Department and Chairman of the Labor Army Committee, was also present. Several new recruits sent representatives to express this request to Fang, who immediately said that he was willing to do his best to discuss a solution with the Military Service Association.

Bathing Facilities Still Lacking

In addition to the resettlement allowance, there are still a few difficulties in the current life of new recruits. One is that bathing facilities are still lacking, and the other is that the drainage system in the barracks has not been built, so it is muddy and unbearable when it rains. It is hoped that all sectors will help to solve these problems. Secondly, because new recruits in this city have lived in the city for a long time, some have contracted venereal diseases. This type of disease is not easy to detect during the examination, but it is gradually discovered after entering the camp. These new recruits will definitely not be accepted if they are sent to Taiwan, and it is beyond our ability to treat them. Therefore, it is hoped that the New Recruit Recruitment Office will pay attention to this situation in the future.

Everyone Rises Up and Enlists Actively

After the reporters' visit, Commander Fu Zhengmo gave a speech stating that the quota of new recruits for Shanghai City this year is 6,000, and there are currently fewer than 2,000. The reason for the slow recruitment is that the general public does not have enough understanding of military service and considers enlisting in the army to be a daunting task. In fact, the hygiene and entertainment enjoyed by today's new recruits are more comfortable than those of the average civilians. In particular, life is strict and disciplined, housekeeping is neat and clean, the relationship between officers and soldiers is harmonious, and the daily life is unified. The physical condition is strengthened by exercise, and the spirit is invigorated by use, which cannot be achieved by ordinary families and schools. Now, not only are there no past abuses and shortcomings in the troops, but also mutual love, sincerity, sharing joys and sorrows, and treating each other like fathers, brothers, teachers, and younger brothers have been achieved. Therefore, there is no reason to fear enlisting in the army. At this critical moment, everyone must rise up and enlist actively, without evasion or fear, contributing strength and money to save the crisis and achieve the goal of suppressing bandits and building the country.

### Young Girl, Unable to Endure Abuse, Runs and Calls for Police Assistance

[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 11:00 AM yesterday, Police Officer No. 1007 at the entrance of the Laoza Gate Police Precinct saw a woman running wildly from Tianjin Road, shouting for help along the way, followed by a person in military uniform, holding a fake pistol in his right hand and a small knife in his left hand. The police officer intercepted him and took him to the police station. The person holding the fake gun confessed that his name was Liu Zhiming, from Jurong, and that he was formerly a soldier and is now unemployed. The woman's name is Zhang Xiaofeng, from Zhenjiang, only 17 years old, living at No. 19 Baishuiguan in Zhenjiang City. In September 1946, when Liu was serving as a soldier there, he had asked someone to propose marriage to the woman, but was unsuccessful. He then raped her twice by force. In June, the woman came to Shanghai with her mother to avoid him. In September, Liu found out and came to Shanghai to find her. The woman once attempted suicide by jumping off a building, but was unsuccessful. On the 19th of this month, Liu borrowed a hand grenade from a friend in the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing, brought it back to Shanghai, and threatened Xiaofeng again, demanding to live with her, otherwise he would kill her. The woman was very frightened after hearing this. The next evening, she was forced to stay overnight at the Tangshan Hostel on Tangshan Road. At dawn, he tried to force the woman to go to Nanjing with him. The woman feigned compliance and they boarded a tram to Xinxin Company on Nanjing Road. When passing the entrance of the Laoza Gate Police Precinct, she suddenly broke free and ran away, shouting loudly. After the precinct took the confession, they sent officers to investigate and confirmed the facts, and then sent the criminal to the local procuratorate for investigation.

### Seaside Bathing Area Unrecognizable: Former Paradise Transformed into Mudflat

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The swimming season that comes with the hot summer once again draws countless novelty-seeking Shanghai residents to the seaside bathing area in Gaoqiao. After all, a pool of clear water in a swimming pool can never compare to the leisure, freedom, and excitement of setting up a tent and playing in the sea. In fact, to this day, I dare say that many people still have extravagant hopes for this only summer retreat in the Shanghai suburbs. But let me tell you: the bathing area of ten years ago has long since sunk into the depths of the sea. The current bathing area is the old seawall base from ten years ago. The world has changed, and everything is unrecognizable!

The Gaoqiao seaside bathing area was first built single-handedly by a wealthy merchant named Yang Hongkui. It was not until 1932 that it was sold to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. All the facilities were well-equipped. Taking the bathing area as an example, it was surrounded by wire mesh and marked with water level signs. It was forbidden to enter during high tide and reopened when the tide receded. Several lifeboats equipped with first aid medicine were always ready to go. There was also a large dining room and rest room built in the area. Tap water was piped from the water tower to the bathing area, so that you could rinse off the mud and sand from your body after washing up. At that time, the transportation was also convenient. Ladies and gentlemen flocked to it. Every weekend, Sunday or holiday, the public buses of the twelfth class were always packed. At the same time, on the left side of the entrance to the bathing area, there was also a magnificent seaside hotel, complete with electric lights and telephones. If you spent a seaside night there, it would undoubtedly make people feel infinite sweetness and joy.

Hotel Desolate, Only the Shell Remains

But what about now? On the gate at the entrance, the green glazed tiles have fallen off in patches, and the two mermaid statues facing north and south on the roof are also completely mutilated. As soon as you enter the gate, you are standing on the sea. The sea water has washed away and submerged the bathing area, leaving no trace. Only the shell of the seaside hotel serves as the office of the police station and the seawall engineering team, squatting desolately in the weeds that reach up to the shins, accompanied by a lonely water tower.

The current so-called bathing area has been moved to the beach about half a mile south of the entrance. If it weren't for Sundays or holidays, you would never see this as a water paradise where people can float and sink. There is only a narrow and long mudflat, where the ladies who come with enthusiasm stir up yellowish-brown mud in the sea water.

Tides Rise and Fall, Extremely Dangerous

Because the water level here has risen two or three feet higher than before, it is impossible to swim far away at all. In the summer of the year before last, five students swam into the deep water and lost track in the rushing tide. Someone once suggested setting up an alarm clock in the temporary stores on the beach, so that it could be rung when the tide rises to call back those who swam far away. However, it is said that in recent years, the number of tourists has been decreasing year by year, and business owners can only do four days of uncertain business a month. Therefore, now you can't even see a single store, and of course, the idea of setting up a bell has also been abandoned. Now there are only some rural women and children renting out tents sewn with patches to the sparse tourists for a price of 150,000 yuan per time.

The proportion of tourists from Shanghai is too small, and it is all the wild children from nearby who are joining in the fun. Although a few blue-eyed, blonde girls are dressed in fancy clothes, acting as the only decoration in the bathing area, they only want to lie down and sunbathe. The turbid mud water really doesn't arouse their interest in going into the water.

According to Mr. Zhou from the Seawall Engineering Office, he has lived here for more than two years, and he has also personally witnessed the scene of five people being tragically submerged before. In today's bathing area, which does not even have the minimum safety guarantees, if you don't understand the so-called high and low tides on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, as well as the daily tidal patterns, and rashly go into the water, it is not leisure, but adventure.

Transportation Becomes a Problem

The most troublesome thing is the transportation problem. After the ferry arrives at Gaoqiao, if you want to go to the town, in addition to squeezing on the only two shuttle buses, there are only expensive rickshaws that can only do one business every few days. And from Gaoqiao Town to the seaside, there are more than three miles of road. When there is no other way, you have to walk, or even ride a wheelbarrow. Under the scorching sun, you are often dizzy, sweaty, and exhausted. If two or three people take a trip like this, plus some dry food or lunch in the town, it turns out that this expense is really considerable!

### General Prices: Prices Soar to Unprecedented Levels, Market Situation Chaotic

This surge in prices began in the first week of this month, lasting for four weeks until the end of last week. Not only has there been no sign of decline, but the rise has been raging, and the range of fluctuations has become larger and larger. Prices are leaping forward at their peak, with new records emerging one after another. If the authorities cannot quickly devise effective countermeasures to stop it, looking ahead, it is extremely worrying. The general index of wholesale prices compiled by this publication rose by 37.34% last week. The money market last week saw both tight and loose conditions. The situation of national bank exchanges showed a deficit of about 3 trillion on Wednesday, showing a tight situation. But in the blink of an eye, funds from other places poured in, and the situation immediately became loose and excessive. Although the authorities have done everything possible to sell materials in an attempt to tighten the situation, the materials are ultimately limited, and the source of funds is endless, so there is a feeling of using a cup of water to put out a cartload of firewood, which is of no avail. The black market interest rate rises and falls with the tightness of the money market, generally moving between 30% and 40%. Although there is no public record of the exchange rate in Hong Kong, judging from the sharp rise in the prices of financial commodities, the Hong Kong exchange rate has been shrinking frequently, which must also be alarming. Here is a brief analysis of the important factors in this price surge:

First, the money market is loose and excessive. Since Finance Minister Wang Yunwu announced the current financial situation figures on the 16th of this month, the income in May was 15 trillion yuan, and the expenditure was 75 trillion yuan. The deteriorating financial situation has been deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public, and the concept of valuing goods over currency has become more and more profound. In addition, a large amount of funds is flowing south, and there is no sign of stopping. According to Commissioner Xu, who is stationed in Hong Kong by the Four Joint Offices, "The phenomenon of funds flowing south is terrible. Taking HSBC Bank as an example, before the war, there were only one or two depositors with more than 10 million yuan (Hong Kong dollars), only more than ten depositors with more than 4 million yuan, and only more than 100 depositors with more than 1 million yuan. Today, the situation has changed drastically. There are more than 1,000 depositors with more than 10 million yuan, more than 10,000 depositors with more than 5 million yuan, and countless depositors with more than 1 million yuan. Other investments and other methods of inflow to Hong Kong amount to 300 million yuan." Such a large amount of funds flowing south naturally forms a sharp contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate, stimulating the sharp rise in prices in Shanghai. Furthermore, recently, the Central Plains War has been lost, and funds from Henan Province have also fled to Shanghai in large numbers. It is estimated that the amount is more than 20 trillion. This large amount of funds is like a flood, which can destroy all artificial measures.

Second, judging from this surge in prices, it seems that the government has used all means, but the result is still at a loss. For example, in the grain market, prices are limited today and free tomorrow. Rice is sometimes sold and sometimes stopped. The allocation of cotton yarn is also intermittent. Due to this reason, the people increasingly distrust the government and the legal currency, resulting in an endless rise in prices.

Third, regarding US aid funds, there have been many twists and turns. The aid to China approved by the US Aid Committee was originally set at 463 million US dollars, but later it was proposed to generally reduce foreign aid expenditures, and the aid to China was reduced to 400 million US dollars, a decrease of 63 million US dollars compared with the original plan, and the date of use was extended to 15 months. Although there was once a rumor of restoring the original amount, the joint committee of the US Senate and House of Representatives finally approved a total amount of 6,030,710,228 US dollars for foreign aid funds on the 19th of this month, including 400 million US dollars for aid to China, which also includes 125 million US dollars for military assistance. In fact, the current economic crisis in our country cannot be solved by increasing this small amount of 60 million yuan. However, under the current high inflation, everyone's psychology is very fragile, and even slight external stimuli often cause great waves.

Fourth, each yarn factory will implement reduced work due to the lack of raw cotton. The Shanghai-Zhejiang-Anhui-Beijing-Shanghai District Machinery Cotton Textile Industry Association decided on Wednesday of last week: "(1) Each factory lacks raw cotton, and the Yarn Management Committee cannot provide emergency assistance. When forced, it will first reduce work by 20%; it will increase or decrease according to the supply of raw cotton. (2) Regarding the reduction of work or all issues related to the reduction of work, the association has elected eight people, including Zhang Zhaozhi and Wang Zijian, to form a temporary subcommittee. Wang Zijian will convene a study today and submit it to the Standing Council for a decision on implementation. (3) The Standing Council will explain to the government authorities and relevant parties the crisis of the textile industry suspending work and request relief to relieve the difficulties." The association held another council meeting on Friday, stipulating the specific steps for implementing the reduction of work. The yarn market last week was almost in a state of frenzy every day. Tracing the reasons, it is closely related to this decision to reduce production.

The market situation last week was due to the fact that the 20th and 21st were the dates for the settlement of interest for the first half of the year for each line of business. Monday was a supplementary holiday, and the market was closed. From Tuesday, prices revolved forward from their peak. On Wednesday, due to the authorities' selling of materials, the difference in the national bank exchanges was about 3 trillion, and the customs also went on strike. It was heard that a sea ship from North China to Shanghai was loaded with a large amount of cash, which was delayed in unloading. Therefore, the money market showed a tight situation, and prices tended to stabilize. From Thursday, prices rose slowly. By Friday, the prices of various goods had risen by 30% to 50% within one or two days. Some markets, due to the excessive rise, were in a chaotic situation and fell into a standstill. In the stock market, except for a small pullback on Wednesday, all stocks rose to the limit on Friday, with Yong Yarn breaking the 5,000 mark. The yarn market also reached a climax on Friday, with 42-count Blue Phoenix closing at 870 million and 21-count Double Horse closing at 7 times. The asking price of Blue Phoenix once reached the 1 billion mark. Longtou Fine Cloth also tracked up, breaking the 20 million mark. Grain prices rose sharply due to rising prices in the production area and outside the circle, and also repeatedly set new records. It was heard that on Friday, the asking price for Shangbai Gengchang outside the market was as high as 18 million. Oil powder also moved forward along with it. On Friday, the peak price for Qingdao Ji Barrel Raw Oil Station was 51 million, and the peak price for Bingchuan No. 1 Powder Station was 4.85 million. Daily necessities such as soap and matches also created new prices above their peak. In addition, categories such as metals, chemicals, and building materials all rose by about 40% to 60%.

The wholesale price index classified by use last week is as follows:

### Currency and Finance

(1) Money Market and Black Market Interest Rate

The money market in this city last week showed a tight situation in the first half of the week. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) The national banks and bureaus continued to have more inflows than outflows; (2) It was rumored that the authorities would continuously sell 20 trillion yuan worth of materials after Tuesday, and people were anxious and eager to collect orders, while the banks and businesses were also very cautious in lending, resulting in a situation where the supply of funds was less than the demand; (3) The financial authorities stipulated that banks and businesses must have sufficient funds deposited in the Central Bank or the Clearing House for the day's balance of the bank drafts they issued, and the number of bank drafts issued was restricted; (4) At the beginning of the week, the inflow of funds from the north decreased slightly, and the strike by customs employees also hindered the inflow of a portion of the cash. However, after Thursday, the situation changed suddenly. On that day, the national banks and bureaus actually returned to having more outflows than inflows, setting a record for the month. It is doubtful whether the authorities still have a large amount of materials to sell. Furthermore, funds from North China and Central China also fled to Shanghai in large numbers due to the defeat in the war, creating a situation of excessive funds in the city. Generally, people value goods over currency, and the velocity of currency circulation has accelerated. In the past, the money market generally took a considerable amount of time between loosening and tightening, but now it has evolved to only three or four days apart. The economic future is really worrying.

The black market interest rate was indeed at a high of 30% to 36% before Wednesday due to the slightly tighter money market. However, after Thursday, due to the alarming rate of price increases, people were generally unwilling to deposit cash, and businesses both inside and outside the industry were eager to collect orders, resulting in the black market interest rate still hovering above 30%, with a strong upward trend. The interest rates on the securities market also continued to rise. On Tuesday, the buying side offered 43 yuan per share, and the selling side offered 38 yuan. However, by Friday, they had each risen to 60 yuan and 55 yuan.

The results of the national bank and bureau exchanges showed a deficit of 4.6812 trillion from Tuesday to Friday, after Monday was a holiday. Even after deducting the 500 billion in fixed deposits from commercial banks, the banks and bureaus still had a deficit of more than 4.1 trillion, which is almost double the number of inflows in the previous five days. This also shows the strength of the floating funds.

Regarding foreign banks, there was a total deficit of 1.6537 trillion from Tuesday to Friday, which was no less than the deficit in the previous five days. This shows the general trend of funds fleeing south.

Before Wednesday, commercial banks and businesses generally lacked orders. Afterwards, because there were many people who needed orders, there were still many who sought to borrow. After the 60th, the exchange banks and businesses had a total deficit of 4.3479 trillion from Tuesday to Friday, which was also an increase compared to the previous week. As for the cash that commercial banks and businesses sent to the Central Bank, the amount was more than 3 trillion, an increase of about 1 trillion compared to the previous week.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

The foreign exchange market last week saw the Hong Kong exchange rate shrink to the edge of 20%, with 20% being made on Thursday, and the shrinking trend was even more alarming on Friday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was between 5.40 yuan and 5.44 yuan. Gold was 325.5 Hong Kong dollars per tael on Monday and 324 yuan on Thursday. The price of exchange settlement certificates was 980,000 on Tuesday, and then continued to rise, reaching 1.35 million on Friday, with a transaction price of 1.32 million.

The domestic exchange rate is as follows: The water of the Guangzhou exchange rate was 160 yuan at the end of the previous week, rose to 200 yuan on Tuesday of last week, and stayed at 180 yuan from Wednesday to Friday. The water of the Xiamen exchange rate once jumped to 160 yuan on Tuesday and then continued to fall, reaching 50 yuan on Friday. The Chongqing exchange rate was a discount of 20 yuan on Tuesday and Wednesday, increased to a premium of 20 yuan on Thursday, and was equal on Friday. The water of the Hankou exchange rate stood high at 140 yuan on Tuesday, 100 yuan on Thursday, and rose again by 10 yuan on Friday, an increase of about double compared to the previous week, which should be related to the defeat in the war in Central China and the inflow of floating funds. The discount on the Tianjin exchange rate continued to increase throughout the week. The discount on the Tianjin exchange rate was 100 yuan at the end of the previous week, rose to 120 yuan on Tuesday of last week, and stood high at 180 yuan from Wednesday to Friday. The outflow of funds from the north to the south was as drastic as before.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

The stock market at the beginning of the week was closed as usual due to the settlement of interest by the money industry. It opened on Tuesday, the money market turned tighter, and the buying interest was slightly slack, with Yong Yarn making 4,235 yuan. Among the small stocks, Lianhua Real Estate was the best, rising by 200 yuan to close at 7,000 yuan. Xinguang and Jinglun each rose by 70 cents to 1 yuan. On Wednesday, the money market was even tighter, new buyers were watching, and people's hearts were not encouraged. Yong Yarn fell to 4,160 yuan, and other stocks also declined slightly. On Thursday, the money market turned loose, and funds from North China continued to arrive. The rising trend resumed, Yong Yarn saw 4,450 yuan again, and other stocks also followed the trend and soared. Meiya, Datong, and Huaxin all reached the daily limit. The market was booming, and the transaction volume was extremely large. On Friday, foreign exchange and materials all rose wildly. The stock market was raging, and each stock saw a full house of red, creating a prosperous record in recent months. Yong Yarn rose by 240 yuan compared to the previous day, with the highest price reaching 5,060 yuan. Xinnuo made 1,811 yuan, and Meiya made 7,610 yuan. Xinguang rose to 62.40 yuan, and Jingfu traded at 33 yuan. On the weekend, an optimistic atmosphere enveloped the market, and each stock rose by about 10% to 20% again.

The foreign stock market was closed on Monday. On Tuesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank, and other gold and black market prices rose, causing a squeeze to rise. Yisha made 8.45 million yuan, and Yinglian traded at 8.8 million yuan. Jardine Matheson made 23.2 million yuan. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate lengthened slightly, and the money market turned tighter. The asking price was slightly weak, and each stock was smaller than the previous day, but Yinglian rose by another 100,000 yuan. In the pre-market on Thursday, the market was still stable due to the lengthening of the Hong Kong exchange rate. In the afternoon, it was heard that there were still funds arriving in Shanghai from North China, and people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Various groups competed to pull up the market, and each stock was unanimously optimistic. Yisha asked for 8.9 million, Yinglian for 9.3 million, and Jardine Matheson made 23.7 million. On Friday, there was a flood of floating funds, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to shrink, foreign exchange soared, and the black market rose wildly. Foreign stocks soared by 50% in one day. Jardine Matheson surged by 6.8 million, directly asking for 30 million to buy in. Yisha also broke the 10 million yuan mark, rising to 12.1 million yuan. Yinglian made 13.1 million yuan. On the weekend, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank again, and people were excited, raising the asking price. Yisha was 13.2 million yuan, an increase of 1.1 million yuan compared to the previous day, and Yinglian was 13.7 million yuan, an increase of 600,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Visiting the Xujin Supplementary School to Commemorate Mr. Pan Weizhen

From the newspapers, we saw introductions to "Xujin"; from the radio, we heard the sounds of "Xujin"; and from the memorial service for Mr. Pan Weizhen, we learned that someone sacrificed for "Xujin." Mr. Pan Weizhen was a classmate at Jiaotong University and the founder of Xujin Supplementary School. He dedicated all his spare energy to running Xujin, eventually becoming ill from overwork and passing away!

I wanted to understand this school better, so I paid a pleasant visit to 553 Lin Sen Middle Road.

Under the glow of fluorescent lights, I met a responsible teacher. He was young and straightforward. When I explained my purpose, he was overjoyed and repeatedly said, "Excellent! Excellent!" He said society's attention to Xujin proves Mr. Pan Weizhen didn't waste his efforts! Xujin is like an infant, and without Mr. Pan's extraordinary mind and perseverance, it would not exist today. But just as the school was learning to walk, Mr. Pan died. Even three or four hours before his death, he was still worried, telling his family, "The school must continue!" At this point, the teacher lowered his head and was silent for a moment.

Then I changed the subject and asked, "How many classes does your school currently have? Is the curriculum mainly focused on science and mathematics?"

"In terms of vertical organization, in addition to subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, Chinese, English, history, and geography from junior high school to university preparatory courses, we also offer projection drawing, mechanical drawing, accounting, bookkeeping, and English newspaper reading. Starting this semester, the junior high school has adopted a dual-track system. Horizontally, we have remedial classes, university preparatory classes, science and engineering crash courses, and high school preparatory classes, all of which are taught face-to-face. Our correspondence courses utilize distance learning, and students in this class are as far away as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Taiwan. To facilitate students with radios, we also have radio broadcast classes. This class will only broadcast university preparatory courses this summer."

"Wow! Such a large scale! How many students do you have now?"

"This is nothing; it's far from our ideal. We currently only have two thousand students, and we've only borrowed two branch campuses: one is Wangjiasha Xinmin Middle School, and the other is Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road. We also offer in-home homework tutoring, bringing knowledge to people's doorsteps. Do you think that will work? We've been trying it for a few months, but because not many people know about it yet, it hasn't been very effective. We need to be more proactive next semester."

"Very good, I wish you success!"

Mr. Guang Sheng stood up, and I said, "You have class, right? Then I'll take my leave!"

"Yes, I'm truly sorry, but please wait a moment." As he spoke, he went inside, took out a piece of paper, and handed it to me: "Please help us promote our student intake. This summer, we want to do more for students who are about to enter university. Classes will start together at the end of June, so now is the perfect time to register, right?" He sincerely shook my hand in farewell. (From Lai Zhi)

### Scientific Progress Never Ends

— Liu Xian

The world is changing rapidly, and resources are scarce. Due to paper limitations and space constraints, this newspaper has decided, after careful consideration, to temporarily suspend seven weekly publications starting July 1st. This publication is no exception and will be subject to a separate announcement. We hope for your understanding!

From the very beginning, this publication has clarified its purpose, emphasizing the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the general public to supplement the lack of scientific education in schools. It is designed for the masses, not for experts. For the past year, we have adhered to this purpose in our editing and selection of materials, taking the level of the general reader as the standard and striving for articles that are in-depth, easy to understand, and interesting. In each issue, advanced theories and popular articles are both included. General discussions and special topics, original works and reports, are given equal importance. We pay particular attention to introducing the trends of scientific research in various countries so that our people can learn from them. Furthermore, we strive to balance the layout and increase scientific illustrations, hoping to provide readers with general scientific knowledge in a subtle way and cultivate the public's habit of reading scientific texts. Now, things have gone against our wishes, and we have encountered real-world difficulties, making suspension unavoidable. We believe that readers will understand this!

Since the 76th year of this newspaper, we have repeatedly opened special columns to publish scientific texts regularly to promote science. Subsequently, due to frequent personnel changes and the ever-changing world situation, publication has been intermittent. This time, we took great care and even adopted the form of a "Science Weekly," hoping for lasting success. Now, due to the paper source, we are repeating history once again, which is truly regrettable. However, this publication, in its nearly one-year short period, has met with readers only 46 times, publishing a total of 227 scientific texts and 37 illustrations. From letters from all sides, we know that the readership is unusually wide, ranging from university professors and research experts to store clerks, factory apprentices, and army soldiers, with middle school teachers and students being the most numerous. If the text is slightly difficult or there are doubts, they immediately write to inquire, encouraging us with praise, which is inspiring. Furthermore, writers are particularly enthusiastic about submitting articles. General publications, especially scientific magazines, often suffer from a lack of manuscripts, but this publication certainly has a surplus. Therefore, we have had to reluctantly discard many gems. We still have boxes of accumulated manuscripts that cannot be published. While expressing our gratitude, we would also like to express our sincere apologies!

Science is the cornerstone of modern civilization and the source of material life. The splendid and progressive achievements of the past three hundred years have created a miracle in human civilization. Future progress will only increase, and future achievements are immeasurable. We should follow the trend, constantly pursue scientific knowledge, and persevere, and we will surely gain something. Scientific progress never ends. As a parting message, we hope readers will take note!

### Tour of the Folklore Specimen Room at Jinan University

— Xu Di

To understand or study the life, customs, habits, and cultural level of a nation, it is necessary to use the nation's daily necessities and uniquely crafted works of art as research materials. Once such items are displayed in a museum, they are called "folklore specimens," which are important materials for studying human science. Collecting a complete set of specimens to represent the cultural form of each nation and making a concrete introduction to society has significant educational significance.

Museums in our country are gradually increasing. Most of them focus on the collection of fine art and antiques, such as the Palace Museum in Beijing, which is particularly outstanding. Or they are natural history museums, and the Shanghai Aurora University Museum has a very rich collection of animal and plant specimens. However, there are very few collections of cultural relics and specimens of special ethnic groups in China. Our country has many ethnic groups in the border areas and hinterland, with different customs. In terms of developing the border areas and studying ethnic cultures, it is essential to have a deep understanding of various folklore customs. Therefore, the collection of folklore specimens and the establishment of exhibition rooms have even greater national defense significance.

There are very few large-scale folklore specimen exhibition rooms in China, and institutions that specialize in the collection of folklore specimens are even rarer. As far as I know, the National Taiwan University has a folklore specimen exhibition room, which has a relatively rich collection of folklore specimens of the Taiwan Gaoshan people, which are the achievements left by the Japanese in the past. The current work situation is unknown. In addition, the Northeast Zhongzheng University in Shenyang also has a folklore specimen exhibition room left by the Japanese. It has now been relocated, but the details are unknown. The West China Union University Museum in Chengdu collects folklore specimens in addition to archaeology. In addition, there are probably many scattered collections in various places, but there are no specific and active working institutions. Two years ago, the Department of Anthropology of National Jinan University in Shanghai was established. After two years of efforts by the person in charge, a folklore specimen exhibition room was established. At present, the room has collected nearly a thousand specimens. Among them, the two parts of specimens about the Taiwan Gaoshan people and the Hainan Island Li people are quite complete. In addition, there are many books and photos. Although the current scale is not large, it is not easy to achieve this in a short period of time and under the situation of tight funds. Even with its current possessions, it is already commendable.

The school's exhibition room held its first public exhibition in the school from July 14th to 16th this year (to celebrate the school's anniversary). At that time, I went to see it after hearing the news. The specimens were displayed in three large classrooms on the upper floor of the College of Science. The layout was quite neat and beautiful, and the lighting was excellent. Each specimen had a detailed explanation, which showed the thoroughness and seriousness of the work. The categories are roughly as follows:

1. Folklore specimens of the Taiwan Gaoshan people - nearly 500 pieces: Hundreds of pieces of clothing and ornaments, hundreds of pieces of pottery and rattan ware, about seventy pieces of weapons, dozens of pieces of religious ritual items, about sixty pieces of works of art, and some other pieces.

2. Folklore specimens of the Hainan Island Li people - about 200 pieces: About fifty pieces of clothing and ornaments, dozens of pieces of various rattan and bamboo daily necessities, dozens of pieces of weapons, more than twenty pieces of religious and ritual items, more than twenty pieces of musical instruments and works of art, and dozens of pieces of textile machinery, tools, and agricultural implements.

3. About hundreds of folklore specimens from other places, including dozens of pieces from Japan, more than ten pieces from Southeast Asia, such as Java and Ceylon, and scattered objects from the Miao, Yao, Luo, and other ethnic groups.

4. Hundreds of photographs of Taiwan Gaoshan people and many related reference documents.

The most eye-catching items include the Taiwan Gaoshan people's valuable "shell bead clothing," the sacred and beautiful ancestral statue wooden screen, the treasure knives and magic spears from hundreds of years ago, and the double-jointed convivial wine cups for two people to drink together. In addition, the beautiful and exquisite textiles of the Hainan Li people, the strange blowpipe arrows, and the strangely shaped magical instruments are all very fascinating.

According to the manager of the room, most of the Taiwan specimens in the room were collected by the Japanese who lived in Taiwan in the past and were purchased by the school after many turns. The Hainan Li people's specimens were personally collected by Professor Liu Xian, the director of the Department of Anthropology of the school, in Hainan Island before the war. Unfortunately, there are financial difficulties at present, and there is no strength to collect on the spot, and many opportunities to purchase have been lost. Currently, it is only the initial stage, and all directions are striving to expand. The room welcomes people from all walks of life to make appointments to visit (the exhibition room is located in the College of Science of the school on East Sports Association Road in this city), and welcomes assistance from all walks of life.

There are not many other places where the collection of ethnic specimens of the Hainan Li people is so complete. As for the folklore specimens of the Taiwan Gaoshan people, the China Art Museum held a public exhibition of the "Taiwan Gaoshan People's Customs Exhibition" some time ago. What was displayed was very similar to what the Jinan University exhibition room has. Unfortunately, general exhibitions often do not have a permanent preservation plan, and many are lost after the event, which is a pity. I believe that since the Jinan University exhibition room has a foundation, why not find a way to obtain them, wouldn't it be more complete? I don't know if the people in charge of both sides have ever had this intention.

After touring the Folklore Specimen Exhibition Room of Jinan University, I dare to make a simple introduction as above, in order to arouse the attention of the knowledgeable people in our country. Finally, I especially hope that the room will work hard and unremittingly. I believe that in a few years, it will be of great scale and will certainly contribute more to the preservation of ethnic culture and the contribution of human science. There is no need for me to say more.

### Gold-Plated Clothes

— Xiao Yan

Professor Charles Stanley Gibbon, head of the Chemistry Department of London Hospital, recently announced that women will soon be able to wear beautiful "real gold" clothes. This was the announcement he made after inventing a method of making gold adhere to any fiber.

Professor Gibbon has been researching gold compounds for the treatment of rheumatism for thirty years. His invention—gold-plated fiber—was an accidental encounter.

One morning, Professor Gibbon walked into his laboratory, picked up a test tube containing some compounds that had been prepared overnight, and saw a layer of glittering gold attached to the wall of the test tube. He quickly checked the composition of the compound in the experimental record book and did it again. As a result, there was still a very thin layer of gold covering the wall of the test tube.

He then tried it on spectacle lenses, mirrors, and porcelain, and got the same results. Finally, he started gold-plating cloth fibers and also achieved great success. This fortunate discovery can predict the future major reform of textiles. Professor Gibbon said that his invention is the most solid method of making gold adhere to fibers, so gold-plated clothes will never fade. He said: "The price of gold-plated cloth is proportional to the amount of gold used, but it will never be so expensive that people dare not ask about it. No matter how old these clothes are, the gold can still be recovered and reused."

In order to demonstrate how to gold-plate glass, Professor Gibbon took a few crystals of medicine, which included many kinds of medicines, as well as gold compounds. He put the crystals in a flask, added alcohol little by little, and kept shaking it until the medicine was completely dissolved. Soon, a layer of gold film appeared on the surface of the flask, with a thickness of about one in one million inches.

Professor Gibbon is now thinking about promoting the use of his invention. Undoubtedly, the use of gold-plated cloth in women's fashion is the most important!

### Atomic Power

— Zheng Ming

Professor Anderle considers the possibility of atomic power being used in war. He predicts that, based on the evolution of the German V2, guided rockets with extremely long ranges may be developed in the future, and each rocket could carry an "improved" atomic bomb. He says that cities on the ground lack effective methods to defend against attacks by these rockets.

He also said that atomic power would be a weapon capable of destroying millions of people and all our major cities, and a harbinger of the total annihilation of our known civilization.

### Under High Pressure

— Steel Man

Using these methods, scientists can explore the changes in matter under high pressure.

Almost all fluids and solids are compressible. People have qualitatively reduced the volume of water by half in the laboratory. Under artificial high pressure, even hard iron has to shrink by five percent, thus speculating that under the "astronomical" high pressure at the Earth's core, even steel would shrink by half its volume.

Pressure not only causes strange changes in volume, but also affects their vaporization and solidification temperatures.

The rise and fall of the melting point are astounding. Mercury only begins to solidify at minus forty degrees Celsius under normal atmospheric pressure, but when the pressure is increased to 14,000 atmospheres, it solidifies at ordinary room temperature.

Almost all substances have the general property that the higher the pressure environment, the higher the melting point. From this, we also understand why matter remains solid in the Earth's core, where the temperature is so high, because of the presence of extremely high pressure.

Only water is an exception. It expands and reduces its specific gravity when it solidifies. Similarly, the melting point decreases conversely as the pressure increases. Therefore, appropriate high pressure can delay the freezing of water from 32 degrees Fahrenheit to a low temperature of minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, with the pressure around 2,000 atmospheres. After that, some strange changes occur. Under severe high pressure, ice succumbs. It is crushed and becomes something completely different, although we still call it ice, but it is undoubtedly a new thing. The specific gravity is greater than the original amount of water, and the melting point increases with pressure.

As the pressure continues to increase, this new type of ice still cannot withstand the high pressure and transforms into another form. Within the range of artificial high pressure, we have obtained six different types of ice. One type of ice, formed under a pressure of 40,000 atmospheres, has a melting point above 100 degrees Celsius, which should be the "hot ice" that can actually be made.

Not only water, but also many substances will metamorphose under high pressure. The record for this metamorphosis is now held by camphor, a household moth repellent, because it has eleven different forms under high-pressure changes.

Pressure also affects the viscosity of a substance (the property of maintaining a fluid's shape under a certain force). Above 2,000 atmospheres, fluids can reach a paste-like state like glass before solidifying.

If it is a solid, this property is plasticity. As the pressure environment increases, the plasticity of the material also increases, allowing it to deform far beyond its strength without breaking, just as an ordinary steel bar can be stretched to more than three times its original length under a pressure of 20,000 atmospheres.

This change in "solid fluidity" under high pressure provides a lot of information for researchers of cosmic structure, allowing them to learn from the rocks of the mountains and strata, the bent rocks, and the materials left on the surface of the Earth, and study the continuous geographical evolution of our planet from ancient times to the present!

The spirit and work of scientists who study pressure are not only not wasted, but are also great; because the issue of pressure not only brings people many amazing facts and valuable knowledge, but it can also be determined that in the future, when people are not satisfied with the environment they are in and want to open up new worlds, the study of pressure should be very important!

### Free Tuberculosis X-ray Screening Expanded - Chinese Civilian Second Hospital Joins Cooperation

The free tuberculosis X-ray screening jointly organized by this newspaper and thirteen hospitals, including Zhongshan, Zhongmei, Zhongxi Sanatorium, Gongji, Renji, Municipal Second, Third, Fourth, Hongren, Nanyang, Hongqiao Sanatorium, Guangci, and the Lung Disease Center Clinic, (1) has been extremely popular since it began on June 21. Among them, those who have completed the procedures and passed the review have been issued a free examination voucher and assigned to nearby hospitals in the area where the applicant resides for examination. As for a small number of applicants who did not follow the prescribed procedures or did not attach a return envelope with sufficient postage and a written address, they will not be processed. Yesterday, this newspaper responded to the requests of the Chinese Sanatorium at 348 Madang Road and the Civilian Hospital at 775 Minguo Road to voluntarily participate in this campaign to provide free services to residents in these areas. After sending staff to inspect the two hospitals, it was determined that their equipment was above standard, so it was decided to start cooperation from today onwards. It is hoped that readers living in the area will actively apply for examination to achieve the effect of collective tuberculosis prevention.

### Telecommunications Q&A - Answered by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

(Mr. Zhang Guoan of Shiyou Road asks) I have newly established a porcelain shop, and business is quite busy. I plan to install a telephone. It is said that in addition to party lines, ordinary businesses are not installing them. What is a party line? What are the application procedures?

(Answer) To install a party line telephone, the applicant should contact a nearby user who already has a telephone installed by our bureau, negotiate and obtain their consent, and jointly submit a letter to the bureau for approval. The nature is the same as an outside extension.

(Qujiang Road Sen Da Lumber Company asks) Due to business needs, our company frequently sends express telegrams, which is very inconvenient to go back and forth to Fuzhou Road every day. Please set up a telegraph booth nearby, which also accepts express telegrams, to benefit merchants.

(Answer) The North Station telegraph booth of our bureau has been open for express telegrams since February. It is closer to the booth location. You can go there to send telegrams directly. Also, the telegraph business in the Qujiang Road area is slack, and it is currently inconvenient to set up a telegraph booth.

(Mr. Li Juntao of Songshan Road asks) Why are express telegrams sometimes rejected?

(Answer) The locations to which our bureau can send express telegrams do not cover the entire country, and because express telegrams have a limited and short time frame (only one and a half hours from when they are sent to when they arrive at the destination), sometimes if the line is slightly obstructed, acceptance will be stopped to maintain the efficiency of express telegrams. The letter did not specify the date and location of the telegram, so it was impossible to investigate. In the future, please attach the original telegram or a copy of the telegraph code for verification and a detailed reply.

### Dr. Mei and Lord Tan

— Chen Yixian

In the past fifty years, the Peking Opera world has produced two outstanding talents, one is the laosheng Tan Xinpei, and the other is the qingyi Mei Lanfang. Both of them not only gathered the great achievements of art, but also possessed the integrity of Mencius' so-called "cannot be subdued by force, cannot be corrupted by wealth, and cannot be moved by poverty." I will briefly describe them.

When Yuan Shikai wanted to become emperor in the fourth year of the Republic of China, his Hongxian dignitaries wrote a play called "Xin'an Tianhui," and on Yuan Shikai's birthday, he specifically named Tan Xinpei as the protagonist of "Xin'an Tianhui." Tan refused. "Xin'an Tianhui" was a monkey play taken from the book "National Traitor Sun Wen," which was rewarded with a prize by the Chuan'an Society, to ridicule Premier, Huang Xing, Li Liejun and others. There was a song of nostalgia for the moon, with many humorous words. After Xinpei refused to sing, Liu Hongsheng took over. After the performance, Yuan Shikai rewarded him with a dragon robe. Xinpei did not come on this day, and the Nine-Gate Admiral Jiang Chaozong sent his garrisoned troops to "Yingxiutang" (Tan's residence name) in Hanjiatan, and forcibly grabbed him to Nanhai Jurentang (where Yuan's birthday hall was located). Xinpei reluctantly sang the play "Qin Qiong Sells His Horse." After the performance, he left without saying goodbye, laughing all the way home. When people asked why, Xinpei said, "I, Xiaojiao (Xiaojiaotian was Tan's nickname), am I not even allowed to laugh?" From this, it can be seen that Xinpei had integrity and did not yield to the Hongxian Emperor, who had absolute power at that time, and was worthy of the name of Lord.

At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Dr. Mei composed the play "Resisting the Jin Soldiers," using the story of Liang Hongyu to strengthen the determination of the Chinese people to fight against the enemy. After the National Army moved west, he took refuge in Hong Kong, thinking that he could hide and be safe, but unexpectedly Japan launched the Pacific War and was still trapped in the enemy. Unable to escape, he grew a beard and refused to perform, indicating that he would no longer step on the red carpet, going to the point of destroying his face and swallowing charcoal, and vowing to sacrifice his life to serve the country. When the Japanese were powerful, Dr. Mei remained firm and unmoved by the coercion and enticement of the enemy and puppets. His difficulty may have exceeded that of Xinpei's refusal of Yuan Shikai, because Dr. Mei was not rich, and had become increasingly impoverished after living in Hong Kong for several years, and his enemies were incomparable to Yuan Shikai.

Regarding Dr. Mei's art, Kuang Qisheng has two lyrics, "Eight-Tone Ganzhou Yingti Xu" and "Ode to Ying," praising the beauty of "Burying Flowers" and "Chang'e Flying to the Moon." Fan Fanshan has the "Mei Lang Song," and Ye Chucang has the "Lanfang's Biography," which are discussed in great detail. I will only take a recent poem given to Dr. Mei by Zhao Chengbo, excerpting one of the four seven-character quatrains as follows:

"Ten years of desolation in the teaching workshop, today laughter and talk in the Xianglou, I beg Mei Lang not to get old, the Central Plains is still the mountains and rivers of the Han."

The art of Tan and Mei has reached its peak. I am a layman, and my words will not be pleasing to the ear. Now, I will only cite the fact that they are unyielding in great integrity. If there is a historian like Sima Qian in the world, perhaps he will continue the biographies of knights-errant and the biographies of jesters with a biography of artists.

Recently, Wenhua Film Company will start filming Dr. Mei's "Luoshen," "Sifan," "Life and Death Hate," and "Drunken Concubine," all of which are said to be five-color films. Mr. Feng Zikai's wish in the article "Revisiting Dr. Mei Lanfang" can be realized.

### Record of the Ming Society

— Zheng Yimei

Among the poetry and literary societies in Shanghai with a long history, the Ming Society should be regarded as a giant. Recently, I also participated in the gathering at the so-called Zhuanyancha Small Yinwo, the Yujia residence in the south of Shanghai. Many old friends were present, such as Zhu Dake, Zheng Zhian, Jia Suxiang, Gu Jingyan, Dai Kekuan, and Zou Zhanru, who submitted their papers one after another. The topic of the poem was the rice price ballad. I also met Yan Zairu, Mao Zijian, and Zheng Xueyun, three gentlemen with whom I had a long-standing spiritual connection. Once we shook hands, how happy it was. I inquired about the history of the society from Zhian, and only then did I know that the society was founded in September of Bingchen, initially with ten people, namely Yang Yinlu, Fang Junhu, Hu Danru, Cai Yangping, Wu Chu-ying, Sun Yusheng, Yu Baoqing, Chen Qiushui, Hu Jifan, and Zhian. Now, eight of them have passed away. Yang and Fang have lost contact. Only Zhian remains as the last spark. The first gathering was at Yang Yinlu's Fenhyueyinlu, and Sun Yusheng was elected to preside over the society's affairs. Yusheng declined, and Wu Ruling became the head, named Qiu Sheng, with a meeting every month. The society members would take turns choosing the topic for each meeting. Later, more people joined the society, and the categories became mixed. Inferior things were put in the same pot, tarnishing the reputation of Bai Gui, causing those who knew themselves to be ashamed to be in the same company as the hawkers. In September of Gengshen, Yusheng and Wu Ruling. Jia Suxiang, Liu Shannong, and Jin Nanguo re-gathered and changed the name to Ming Society, and established the society's charter. In Xinyou, Wu died, and Yusheng continued to be the president, and published the Ming Society Magazine monthly, with Huang Mengyuan in charge of the editorial policy, selecting and publishing the works of the society members; a preface was placed at the beginning, which was exquisite and rich, with the lingering charm of the Chen and Liang dynasties, which was Mengyuan's handwriting. Later, the Shanghai Tong Sheng Zheng Xu Ji was published again, with the wind and rain crowing, marking the guard and the flag pavilion hall singing, and praising the Tang sages, and for a time, those who came to join were like Xia Jiancheng, Li Bake, Chen Hechai, Mao Heting, Qian Mingshan, Gu Foying, Yao Jinqiu, Zhou Mengpo, Huang Gongzhu, Deng Chunshu, Tang Dingzhi, Ye Zhongleng, Xie Yucen and others, totaling more than one hundred people, which was quite prosperous. When the incident happened, Yusheng died of grief for the country, and Yu Baoqing succeeded him but also died, and the elegance disappeared for several years. After the victory, he just reorganized the society's affairs, and Baoqing's son Yuanying took the helm. Every year at the spring festival, he would publicly pay tribute to the deceased friends at the Poetry Hall in Meiyuan, following the old practice. All the society's lessons are recorded and stored in dozens of volumes. I checked and recited them, such as Ten Sounds, West Lake Persuasion Song, Watching the Tide, Tu Lu, Ancient Coins, Bansong Garden, Hot Pot, and Fallen Cabbage. The works of the society members, some with towering style, some with peaceful and flowing beauty, each with its own characteristics. The most interesting one is the mocking of cherry blossoms, which was selected by Zhu Guwei, and was triggered by the violent actions of the Japanese, with humor, which is quite thought-provoking.

### A Lian Poem

— Bai Jiao

Running down the stairs quickly chasing a ball, climbing on my knees to ride like a horse. Imitating scattering flowers like a little concubine, and also humming lullabies. Everyone becomes a ghost, always begging for food like owing a debt. Suddenly calling me "Old man," startling me to feel new sorrow; time flies like a revolving wheel by the stairs, the weather outside the door is ever-changing! I am too lazy to compete for fame for thousands of years, but only wish for peace and happiness to live together! In the past, there were rich and poor in the world, and the generals worked hard to kill people! Don't the children see the green continuous ridges and the frogs drumming high, and the men in the villages fleeing in the night?

### Reading in Sickness

— Ji Mo

I went to see a friend recuperating in the hospital. He was quite troubled by the loneliness of being sick. When idle, he only reads books and newspapers as a pastime, except for occasionally taking a walk. However, suitable reading materials during illness are very rare.

It seems that popular American books such as detective novels and mystery novels are often too taxing on the brain. At the same time, I am eager to know the ending, and the emotional tension is not suitable for the sick body.

The second is to look at illustrated magazines, or so-called magazines with both pictures and texts, but sometimes I will also see many strange pictures, such as fantasy paintings of the earth surrounding the universe, imagined aliens on Mars with four legs that can rotate like electric fans, or the shadow of an unknown giant beast crawling out of the sea... All of this makes the sick reader feel bizarre and illusory, and after watching too much, it is inevitable to have a faint headache.

Probably because of the soaring prices and high costs, the blank space left at the top and bottom of each page of general books is often very small, and the characters are arranged densely. This is true for magazines sold in the market, as well as supplements such as the weekly literature and education supplements of the British Times, as well as clumsy, New Yorker, Time, and other magazines, so it is very difficult to read.

According to my personal experience, I once read a children's book compiled by the late Mr. Tao Xingzhi while I was sick. The selections were all articles by famous writers, with profound meaning and simple writing, just like an elderly person eating well-cooked meat, which is exactly what I like.

The ideal reading material during illness seems to be printed with a larger format, with large characters, and the number of words per article is limited to five or six hundred, with some interesting black-and-white paintings, which do not need to be very sophisticated or complicated, and there is no need to imitate American five-color printing or active picture-style children's books.

As for the content of the article, each article should preferably contain only one or two ideas, so that the reader can understand it at a glance, and the principle is that there is no need to think.

The author has written down these simple opinions here. If publishers pay attention, and the bookstore compiles and prints books with the nature of reading during illness, or if the newspaper publishes a similar supplement at intervals of several days, thinking of the many readers who have this need anytime and anywhere, perhaps a new path can be opened up in the cultural industry.

### Shen Shiyou and Wu Changshuo

— Qian Dacheng

In recent times, Changshu's Shen Shiyou was considered a leading figure among collectors of famous inkstones. He developed four large volumes of "Shen's Inkstone Collection," with Wu Changshuo's painting "Appreciating Inkstones Rock" as the frontispiece of the first volume. Shiyou and Changshuo were known to be close friends, and their collected poems contain no less than a hundred exchanged verses. After Shiyou's death, Changshuo engraved twelve volumes of his poems, writing in the preface: "Shiyou's nature and conduct were upright and bright, but he lived in seclusion, his footsteps never leaving the area between Wu and Yue. He loved inkstones and spent his years composing poetry and caressing them." Shiyou also once said of Changshuo, "The longer you associate with him, the more respect you feel. Therefore, his works are rooted in his nature and emotions, unlike ordinary art talkers." (Note: Shiyou's miscellaneous essays are kept in manuscript form at the Shen family's Shimi Zhai in Changshu and have not been published.) The friendship between the two can be seen here. They would exchange letters every few days, and Changshuo would often visit Changshu. Zhao Guni once lived at Shiyou's home, and thus was able to inherit Changshuo's mantle.

Shiyou's collection contained about one hundred fifty to sixty inkstones. Most of the inscriptions were written by Changshuo, with some carved by Zhao Guni. Shiyou also wrote inscriptions himself. Among his collection, a Song dynasty turquoise portrait inkstone was considered the finest. It had a poem inscribed by Ma Shouzhen: "Jade from the Song-Tao River, the ink pool has survived many tribulations; a beauty left on the back of the inkstone, could it be my former autumn waves? I obtained this inkstone in the third month of Jiwei. The fish in the ink pool are damaged. Its back resembles my eyebrows and eyes, and there is also a mole on the right cheek. Is this my past life? A-Cui, suspected to be Su Cui. If so, I should shave my head and enter a Buddhist temple, vowing never to be reborn into this sea of suffering. Recorded by Shouzhen." Changshuo wrote a postscript: "Shiyou showed me the Su Cui portrait inkstone, inscribed by Ma Shouzhen, which can be called doubly exquisite. Cui was a courtesan, skilled in ink bamboo and clerical script..." Shiyou also inscribed three quatrains, which were carved by Guni. After Shiyou's death, he was buried with it, even composing two epitaphs for the inkstone, saying: "What good did my life do to the world? I return to my resting place here, burying no gold or jade, only the poems of my life." And: "The great furnace of creation, the Yin-Yang bellows, unlucky gold leaps and cries. People value intelligence, but I guard my simplicity, hoping to preserve my pure and white body; a hundred or a thousand years later, I will mock the corrupt scholars." Other notable inkstones included the "Li Yi'an Collection Inkstone," the "Ruan's Xiaoyun Yin Guan Shuangjing Inkstone," the "Lv Wancun Jing Te Inkstone," the "Wang Xisheng Portrait Inkstone," the "Ruan Wendagong Goose Flock Inkstone," the "Fu Qingzhu Genuine Handwriting Inkstone," the "Xu Sizhai Yellow Leaf Inkstone," the "Zhu Zhaolao Ren Collection Inkstone," and the "Zeng Wenzheng Gong Sui Inkstone"... all were unforgettable masterpieces. However, after his death, his unworthy son, whom Shiyou often denounced as a pig or dog in his poems, first mortgaged them to the bank for several thousand gold pieces, and then they were packed up and taken away by the Japanese. The family fortune was also squandered by his son, and the line became extinct.

Shiyou had a very high opinion of himself, and was out of step with the world. He was particularly proud of his poetry, once writing: "Three thousand worlds are filled with heartbreak, five hundred years without a poem that catches my eye." It is fitting that he spent his days in silence, embracing inkstones until the end.

Shiyou's name was Ru Jin, courtesy name Gong Zhou, self-styled Dun Jushi (Dull Recluse), a Qing dynasty student. He authored the "Ming Jian Bai Zhai Poetry Collection." He was also able to paint, often collaborating with Changshuo and Wu Qiunong. Shiyou himself said that their works should be viewed as linked verse. I also have a painting of a turnip by him, inscribed: "The fragrance of vegetable roots, the leaves are plump, growing vegetables behind closed doors can alleviate hunger, eating vegetables is better than chicken ribs, I wish the world had no hungry faces." This shows his aspirations.

### Half a "Non-" Character

— You Mojun

Every week, I correct more than one hundred and fifty test papers. Statistically, authors use two methods to remove incorrect characters on the paper: (1) put a dot to remove the misspelled character and put the corrected character next to the mistake; and (2) add three dots to the right of the misspelled character, and write the character that should be written below it. The former is not discussed. The latter, however, was used by people in the past. The question is why three dots were used as a symbol. There is a process in between.

According to my understanding, writing cannot be completely free of errors. Therefore, there must be regulations on how to handle errors in order to show uniformity. It is not easy for us to know what regulations existed before the Song Dynasty; As for the people of the Song Dynasty, they often noted half of the character "非" (non) next to the wrong word for the sake of distinction. For example, in the "Ai Ri Zhai Cong Chao," it is said that Sima Wengong and his grandfather were seen discussing the "Zi Zhi Tong Jian" at Fan Jiyi's place. There were wrong characters, and the word "非" (non) was noted next to them. Only then did they know about half of the character "非" (non). Sima Wengong used this, thinking that there was also a basis for it. It should be a kind of rule in the writing method at that time. Later, some people simplified it into something like "卜," but I am afraid it is difficult to avoid ambiguity in meaning, so they simply changed it to three points. The "Yun Lu Man Chao" also has this saying.

### The China New Map in Preparation (1)

— Fang Jun

The first edition of the "China Provincial New Map" was published in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), and was reprinted half a year later. The third edition was published in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), and the fourth edition was published in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). Each edition has been revised, and the third and fourth editions are the most revised. The newly released data increased year by year, and the most occurred before and after the start of the war. Moreover, in these few years, domestic construction projects have advanced by leaps and bounds, and most of the maps must be revised, which is inevitable. However, since then, the situation has become increasingly tense, and manpower and material resources have become increasingly difficult, so the reorganization work came to a standstill. This has been out of print for nearly ten years.

In the past ten years, the data of the map has increased a lot. The 1:50,000 detailed actual measurement map published by the Measurement Bureau of our country has accounted for half of the country's area, plus the aerial survey results of the US 14th Air Force in China at the end of the war, and the measurement of the Japanese in the occupied area. With the implementation of the measurement of longitude and latitude, geological and geological routes in various places, all of these make the old map lose its color, and it is necessary to re-edit it. At this time, Shen Bao Newspaper brought up the old matter again and entrusted me with the preparation of a new map. With the funding secured, the reorganization work was able to proceed smoothly.

There are two purposes for this compilation: One is to use the original manuscript of the fourth edition as soon as possible and apply partial corrections to publish it in a short period of time. The second is to use new materials, sort them out, and recompile a new map. The former is a continuation of the above-mentioned editions and is the fifth edition. The latter is a new type of map, and its format and style are very different from the former, not to mention the different data used. The name of this new map has not yet been decided, and it is now temporarily named the China New Map.

Now that the fifth edition of the Provincial New Map is about to be published, I would like to briefly explain the revisions to this map. I would also like to take this opportunity to introduce the materials and compilation methods used in the new map. I think readers will be happy to hear about it.

The revision of the fifth edition is mostly based on administrative regions. In the past ten years, dozens of counties and cities have been abolished, and the northeast, which was originally three provinces, is now divided into nine provinces. As for the restoration of Taiwan, all of these must be corrected one by one. The next largest revision is Fujian Province. In the previous four editions, the materials used in this province were very unreliable, and only a few survey routes were used as a basis to supplement the maps compiled from various small scales. There are many places where it does not match the actual situation. Now, the coastal areas are based on the US military aerial survey maps, and the central part is based on the 1:50,000 topographic map measured by the province's land survey team. Compared with the previous map, it is much more accurate. Another example is Dongting Lake in Hunan Province. The original map was based on a 1:100,000 survey map, which was published between the 6th and 7th years of the Republic of China (1917-1918). Over the past thirty years, the lake has gradually become silted up. The huge monster that once lay across the border between Hunan and Hubei is now located in the east corner, and its area has shrunk to less than a quarter of its original size. It is a pity that the American aerial map had not yet been sent when it was revised, so the material used in this edition is still the map measured by the Hunan Construction Department ten years ago. Although it still differs from the current shape, it is closer to the actual situation than the previous one. As for the latest materials, we have to wait for the publication of the new map. Secondly, what can be mentioned is the revision of the highways. Before printing this edition, each map was checked one by one against the blueprints sent by the National Highway Administration, and important stations were added one by one, and the main and branch routes were divided into thick and thin lines to show the difference. When printing, they are also indicated in red to make them eye-catching. In addition, the addition and deletion of locations, the redrawing of missing panels, and even the proofreading during printing are no less complicated than the compilation of a new map.
