### Coordinating the Completion of Economic Reforms: The President Orders Comprehensive Austerity, Designating Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, and Li Weiguo to Draft Measures; Foreign Exchange of Firms and Banks to be Deposited in the Central Bank in the Short Term

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Following the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the President has again instructed the relevant authorities to draft comprehensive austerity measures to coordinate implementation, aiming for a two-pronged approach to rapidly achieve the intended goals and complete the current economic reform task. The President first conveyed this idea to Weng Wenhao during a meeting on the 29th and immediately designated Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, and Li Weiguo to be responsible for drafting the measures. It is heard that the main principle of these measures is to implement comprehensive controls, modeled after the austerity measures of the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the Executive Yuan's Austerity Supervision Committee will also engage in promotion for the advancement of the austerity plan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian convened a meeting with the heads of various departments and bureaus on the afternoon of the 30th to discuss issues related to coordinating implementation after the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The National Federation of Banking Associations, the National Federation of Native Banks, the Shanghai Native Bank Association, and the Shanghai Trust Association have jointly telegraphed the President in support of the Emergency Financial Measures.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The government hopes that all foreign exchange held by various banks, bureaus, commercial firms, and banks will be deposited in the Central Bank in the short term. Last Saturday, Premier Weng convened a symposium of leaders of commercial firms and banks in Shanghai. Following the adjournment of the meeting of the Joint Board of Directors, he immediately met with the heads of various national banks at the Premier's No. 1 residence in the Executive Yuan to explain the government's intentions. All national banks expressed their support for this. It is heard that the Central Bank has decided to convene other banks and bureaus in Shanghai within a day or two to discuss the technical issues of depositing the foreign exchange.

### Deadline for Capital Increases for Firms and Banks Unchanged; Standards for Minimum Capital of Businesses Determined

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Regarding the issue of increasing capital for banks, native banks, and trust companies, in addition to the opinions expressed by leaders of the Shanghai financial community at the symposium convened by Premier Weng a few days ago, the three Shanghai industry associations for banks, native banks, and trust companies have jointly submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance requesting an extension of the "two-month deadline to reach the minimum capital" and stating that the reported minimum capital of one million gold yuan for banks in the Shanghai area is beyond the capacity of most banks. The Ministry of Finance is currently studying the opinions of the Shanghai financial community and the banking and native banking industries. Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan, and senior officials in charge within the Ministry have discussed this matter repeatedly in recent days. It is heard that the decision has been made not to change the requirement to reach the minimum capital within two months, as this is stipulated in the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures promulgated by the President. Any easy change would affect the integrity of the entire plan. However, the specific amount of the minimum capital is still being drafted and has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan, so it has been decided to reconsider it. When drafting the measures in the future, the minimum capital for banks may be revised to below one million gold yuan. Furthermore, there was no meeting held by the Ministry of Finance on the morning of the 30th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] According to the provisions of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the capital of all companies and businesses nationwide should be re-determined in terms of gold yuan, and registration of the changes should be completed within six months. In order to study the standards for calculating capital and the amount of the minimum capital, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially invited the Ministry of Finance, the Resources Commission, and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to a meeting on the morning of the 30th, presided over by Deng Hanliang, Director of the Commerce Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, to exchange opinions on the above issues. Regarding the minimum capital of companies and businesses, it has been decided that the minimum capital for companies is 1,500 gold yuan, and for businesses, it is 500 gold yuan, with each share valued at one gold yuan. As for the method of calculating capital, it has been decided not to re-evaluate assets. When converting to gold yuan, one of the following two methods will be chosen: One is to convert the company's capital at the time of establishment to the value of legal tender based on the price multiple as of August 19, 1937, and then convert it to gold yuan. The other is to convert the company's capital at the time of establishment to the value of legal tender based on the pre-war price level, and then convert it to gold yuan, with one gold yuan being equal to one or two legal tender yuan before converting to one gold yuan. A final decision has not yet been made. The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics will be asked to provide the price increase multiple from before the war to August 19 of this year as a calculation standard, and then a meeting will be held to discuss the matter. It is expected that the measures will be drafted this week and submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion next week.

### Joint Board to Continue Discussions; Scope of Loan Recipients; Rumors of Four New Loans Being Approved are Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The Joint Treasury will hold its 371st Board of Directors meeting on the 2nd to continue discussions on the scope and recipients of loans, which were not completed last Saturday, and to discuss loan review and post-loan evaluation and other matters. The meeting was originally held once every two weeks, but this week's meeting was verbally agreed upon at last Saturday's meeting, with the aim of determining the scope and recipients of loans as soon as possible. The persons in charge of the various national banks are already in Shanghai conducting special studies on this issue.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] According to information from the Joint Treasury; Since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the national banks have been instructed to suspend the issuance of new loans, and this has not yet been lifted. The Board of Directors of the Joint Treasury did not discuss loan cases on the 28th of this month. The report that the board approved four new loans is not factual.

### Resumption of Stock Exchange; Authorities Have Not Yet Made a Decision

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The government has not yet made a decision on the requests from Du Yuesheng, Wang Zhixin, and others to allow the stock exchange to resume operations. According to a relevant person in charge on the 30th, there are two points worth considering regarding the resumption of stock exchange operations. One is that since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, all prices of goods and labor have been limited to the prices as of August 19. If the stock exchange resumes operations and stocks are listed, it will undermine the price limit policy. The other is that the issue of company capital increases has not yet been decided. If stocks are still listed at their legal tender face value, it seems inappropriate. Therefore, the resumption of the stock exchange will be postponed until November 21, when the use of legal tender is completely discontinued. The sale of shares in state-owned enterprises will be an opportunity for the stock exchange to resume operations. However, the government has not yet made a decision to resume operations.

[Our Dispatch] Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Stock Exchange, visited Nanjing a few days ago to consult with the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce regarding the resumption of the stock exchange. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. He stated that the authorities believe that there is no problem in principle with the resumption of operations, but the date cannot yet be determined.

It is reported that the agenda for the first meeting, in addition to reporting items, will focus on issues related to amending the Organic Law and Rules of Procedure of the Legislative Yuan and will be submitted for discussion as soon as possible. The main points of these issues are approximately as follows: (1) Amend Article 5 of the Organic Law regarding the method of selecting the convening members of each committee. The provisional method for the first session was to determine the conveners by drawing lots among the Zhi Gu (Senior Advisor) members. The results of the trial implementation showed that the efficiency of the proceedings was significantly affected. It is planned to change it back to the committee members electing each other in this session. (2) Amend Article 8 of the Organic Law. The original provision was that motions submitted by members of the Legislative Yuan should first be submitted to the Yuan (Legislative Yuan) for discussion. In fact, broad discussions in the Yuan during the initial stage are time-consuming. It is planned to amend this so that all motions should be submitted for review first. (3) Amend Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure. The original provision was to hold regular meetings twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays. The experience of the first session showed that many believed this was too frequent. It is planned to amend this to hold regular meetings once a week. If there are too many motions, meetings can be held for several consecutive days.

The Internal Affairs and Local Self-Government Committee of the Legislative Yuan has collected and sorted these suggestions on time and is now working on compiling and printing them for distribution to the members for detailed study, in order to carefully determine the rules of grass-roots democratic politics. The draft will be submitted for discussion as soon as possible during the second session. Once it is adopted, the comprehensive completion of our country's constitutional work can be realized soon.

Editorial

### How to Plug the Loopholes of Price Controls?

Since the implementation of the new currency system, the general response has been very positive, and commodity prices have been particularly stable. This is certainly due to the efforts of local authorities and the sincere support of the general public. With such mutual support from above and below, and persistent effort, we can confidently believe that the success of the new currency can indeed be grasped.

Regarding the stabilization of commodity prices, there are indeed some minor loopholes. Although these loopholes do not currently affect the overall situation, a single spark can start a prairie fire. To prevent problems before they arise and to promptly remedy them, we must point out the facts to call public attention.

First, commodity prices in Changsha have generally risen. Compared to the benchmark of August 19th, they have already increased by 70%, with the highest exceeding more than double. However, the local authorities have taken no action to date. At first glance, this seems to be a local issue, perhaps insignificant, but in reality, the fluctuations in commodity prices in different regions are interconnected. It is truly a case of "when the copper mountain collapses in the west, the bell in Luoyang answers in the east," no matter how insensitive one may be. The main reason for the failure of price controls in a few cities in the past was precisely this. Taking rice prices as an example, Shanghai implemented price controls, but the producing areas failed to proceed simultaneously, so it had to be abandoned to avoid blocking the source. If the price of rice is like this, how can the prices of other commodities be any different? Therefore, if this system of price control is to be maintained without failing, it must be promoted comprehensively to be effective.

Second, it is said that although price controls on tung oil have been strictly enforced in this city, the Transportation Control Committee, to avoid price increases and competitive purchasing, has stipulated a price of two jiao per pound. However, a certain producing area, using various excuses, has allowed the price to rise, far exceeding the market price of August 19th. As the ancients said, "Move one hair and the whole body is affected." It is obvious whether this exception will affect the remaining commodity prices and the prices in other ports.

Third, as far as Shanghai is concerned, many goods still come from bandit-controlled areas, such as pigs, which mostly come from northern Jiangsu. Needless to say, they will not implement price controls simultaneously. In the areas close to the bandit-controlled areas, it is said that there are also many taxes and temporary expenses under various names, not only without any restrictions, but also adjusted at any time, which will naturally affect the cost and the price control. It is indeed extremely difficult to solve this difficulty in practice, but in order to maintain the supply and price control in this city, we have to find ways to overcome it.

Fourth, many shops and vendors, in order to avoid selling at the controlled price, often close early or supply inferior goods. This is a common occurrence in the vegetable market. The purchase price is too high, and they are unwilling to lose money, so they may have their own unavoidable difficulties. However, it must be known that this widespread implementation of price control is not due to a temporary expedient measure by local officials, but due to the established national policy of the central government, which cannot be perfunctorily dealt with temporarily. Therefore, those in the industry should work together to suppress the purchase price to seek legal survival, and should not procrastinate and look forward to leniency. Our suggestion is not only for the benefit of consumers, nor only for stabilizing commodity prices and supporting the currency system, but also for maintaining their business.

Fifth, according to a Chengdu dispatch, due to the city government's forced resumption of business and strict implementation of price controls, the stores' inventory was mostly snapped up by citizens, and price-controlled goods were almost nowhere to be found, causing prices to rise again. This reflects several things: the wholesale market price does not seem to have been controlled simultaneously, otherwise, with goods coming in and going out, price-controlled goods would never disappear; this is one. Stores using pretexts to refuse sales is not a good way to deal with the situation, because the more they refuse to sell, the easier it is to cause the public to compete to buy; this is two. The implementation of price controls, in addition to using political power, must also take into account economic principles, that is, the maintenance of reproduction and the unblocking of sources; this is three. Since the currency system reform order was announced, the number of supplementary decrees issued by various ministries and commissions has been quite large, but most of them still focus on strengthening control and restoring pre-war bottom lines. As for the development of production and the promotion of industry, aside from the convenience of official documents and the occasional mention of one or two sentences, no facilities have been seen. This is really a disappointing thing. Looking at the story of the price-controlled goods in Chengdu being snapped up, it should be understood that economic problems can never be solved solely by political means.

Sixth, supplementary measures for consolidating public finances have been announced. Many of the new tax rates and fees set therein are adjusted according to wartime standards. There seem to be quite a few others that are still under discussion according to this standard. Whether this standard is appropriate to restore completely at present is another question. However, the current price control level is not entirely consistent with the pre-war level. If the current price has already been raised, and then taxed according to the pre-war standard, whether this will affect the cost and whether it is consistent with the authorities' policy of maintaining price control is worth noting. It is said that the cigarette industry will raise the commodity tax to the pre-war standard. The cost is high, and it is difficult to maintain the price control of August 19th. Representatives have been sent to Beijing to seek consideration. This is an example. In particular, the treatment of public and teaching staff is much lower than before the war, but they still have to shoulder the same burden as before the war. Whether this is fair in terms of reason and emotion cannot be ignored. We also know that balancing the budget is one of the main conditions for consolidating the new currency system, but the importance of maintaining price control is definitely not lower than balancing the budget. If price control is broken through, I am afraid that there is no appropriate way to remedy it. Therefore, we believe that any income that is sufficient to increase the cost of goods should be temporarily postponed, at least for the time being.

In short, stabilizing commodity prices is the most important task at present, and everyone should be anxious about what is urgent and move towards this goal together. The government has the responsibility of supervising and promoting, and should especially address both the symptoms and the root causes, and remove all obstacles to facilitate the implementation of the gold yuan. As for all measures that are sufficient to stimulate commodity prices and affect the value of the currency, on the part of the people, the competent authorities in various places should resolutely crack down and correct them at any time.

He could have gone to take up the new position, but he did not make the trip because he was waiting for the Land Court's acquittal.

### Difficulty in Drafting Communiqué: Four Powers to Confer Again; Kremlin Meeting Lasted Two Hours Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] London, 30th, Moscow broadcast: The Kremlin meeting continued for another two hours and ten minutes, ending at 7:10 PM. Molotov and Vyshinsky both participated in the meeting. According to US Ambassador Smith: No communiqué was issued on the evening of the 30th, and talks will continue. It was previously reported that a communiqué would be issued after this meeting, but since the issuance has been delayed, it is generally believed that difficulties must have arisen in the consultation regarding the drafting of the communiqué.

[United Press, Moscow, 30th] Envoys from the three Western powers went to the Kremlin at 2:00 PM today (standard time, 11:00 PM Shanghai savings time) for the eighth meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It is generally believed that a communiqué regarding the negotiations will be released late in the evening on the 30th. US Ambassador Smith, British Envoy Roberts, and French Ambassador Chataigneau held a brief consultation at the French Embassy before going to the Kremlin, and they undoubtedly fully agreed on the detailed plan for issuing the communiqué. Premier Stalin will not attend the meeting on the 30th. It is generally believed that the talks will focus almost entirely on the planning work for the communiqué, which is expected to announce that an agreement has been reached on the unification of the Berlin currency and the effective lifting of the Berlin ground blockade by the Soviet Union.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 30th, Berlin broadcast: The Berlin City Council voted on the 30th to postpone the meeting until the four powers issue a communiqué on the Kremlin negotiations and the Soviet Union agrees to provide police protection.

### Former French Premier Marie Resigns After Recognizing the Difficulty; Schumann Appointed to Form New Cabinet; Currently Consulting with Leaders of Various Parties

[United Press, Paris, August 30] President Auriol today requested former Premier and financial expert Schumann to come forward and form a new cabinet. Auriol's move came after Marie declined to serve as Premier. The President received Marie's letter of refusal at midnight yesterday and immediately summoned Schumann, instructing him that since both the extreme left and the extreme right factions want to seize power, swift action must be taken. Observers believe that the resignation of the Marie cabinet has created the most serious political crisis in France since the war, with both the Communist Party and de Gaulle's right-wing faction vying for power.

[United Press, Paris, August 30] Former Premier Schumann of the Popular Republican Movement accepted the President's request this morning and is now accelerating efforts to form a cabinet in order to gain sufficient strength of majority support in the National Assembly to form a coalition cabinet. Schumann belongs to the Popular Republican Movement and served as Premier from November 22, 1947, until July 19 of this year, when he resigned due to a vote of no confidence in the Assembly. Marie served as Premier before Schumann.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, August 30] Commentaries in Parisian newspapers unanimously believe that Schumann will face many difficulties in forming a cabinet. Commentaries in all newspapers unanimously agree that the establishment of a financial and economic plan acceptable to all parties will remain an obstacle to Schumann forming a new cabinet. The conservative newspaper "Parisien Libéré," close to de Gaulle, stated in its editorial that Schumann will encounter the same difficulties as his predecessor, and that he must first find an economic program acceptable to his cabinet members, and then find personnel to implement this program. The newspaper is pessimistic about Schumann's chances of success, concluding that if Schumann fails to form a cabinet, there is only one person who can save the situation, and that is the President of the National Assembly, Herriot. The conservative "France Soir" predicts Schumann's great difficulty in forming a cabinet, stating that even if Schumann obtains the support of the majority to form a new cabinet, he will encounter serious difficulties in the allocation of cabinet positions, in addition to the issue of the economic recovery plan. The task of solving this problem is truly of greater importance than all other problems.

According to the newspaper, Franco expressed his willingness to recognize Don Juan's eldest son, Carlos, as the heir to the Spanish throne, on the condition that Don Juan himself renounce his own claim. However, Don Juan has not yet given a definite answer, as he needs to consult with his advisors.

The article specifically accuses the new constitution of the Malayan Union of placing Chinese residents in a "politically neglected position," while the number of overseas Chinese and Chinese residents "accounts for almost half of the entire population of Malaya and Singapore."

The article continued, stating that the British Labor government, in cabinet statements and white papers after the war, revealed political systems in Malaya with "progressive and improved characteristics." These statements stated that the British government had decided to: (1) abolish the privileges of the Malayan rulers; (2) establish a Malayan Union based on democratic principles; and (3) grant citizenship rights to all residents of Malaya, regardless of ethnicity. "The last provision would allow approximately 2.7 million Chinese to enjoy full political rights in the autonomous federation allowed by Britain." However, "when then Governor General Gurney appointed a constitutional organization on July 26, 1946, he went against the above-mentioned policies. This constitutional organization included five official representatives, four representatives of local rulers, and two representatives of the Malayan Ex-Services League."

### US Policy Towards Japan Has Lost the Confidence of Allied Nations

Commentary by British Correspondent in Tokyo

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] British Conservative "Sunday Observer" correspondent in Tokyo, Trassey, today wrote an article criticizing US policy toward Japan, stating: The purpose of American policy is no longer to establish democracy in Japan, but to increase Japan's economic strength as quickly as possible to reduce the burden on American taxpayers, and to use Japan as an American strategic base in the event of a war against the Soviet Union. American policy has gradually lost the trust of various allied nations. Under the guise of security, the United States is working to support reactionary politics and industry, and is hostile to those who are more popular with the people. And most intolerable is that the pre-war Japanese secret thought police have gradually revived under the guise of the communist threat.

### Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands Reigns for Fifty Years

In this era of turbulent changes, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who has reigned for fifty years, is now about to retire, and her daughter, Princess Juliana, will take over.

There are two reasons that will make Queen Wilhelmina as famous in history as the great queens of all dynasties. The first is that the beginning of her reign and the length of her reign are similar to that of the great Queen Victoria of England; second, the splendor of her political achievements and her decisive judgment during her reign can be compared to another famous Queen Elizabeth of England. Therefore, it is very reasonable to guess that the Queen is modeling herself after Queen Elizabeth. When the Queen was just twenty years old and talking about marriage, she said, "Can't I govern myself like Queen Elizabeth of England?"

But despite all this, the Queen finally married the person she chose and had an heir, and like Queen Elizabeth, she governed the country to prosperity, so that future historians will name the period from 1898 to 1948 as the "Wilhelmina Era".

The Queen was born on August 31, 1880. When her father, King William III, died in 1891, the Queen was only eleven years old. At such a young age, she became the head of a country, and her mother acted as regent.

At that time, Wilhelmina was the formal Queen, but she was still a childish and playful girl, and she would sometimes play small jokes at social gatherings. Her mother wisely allowed her to be as happy as possible. When the young Queen was in danger of violating etiquette, her mother was always able to cleverly find a way to eliminate it. The young Queen's natural and childish behavior made the public feel fond of her. In the spring of 1895, the Queen visited England, when the youngest Queen of Europe, Wilhelmina, and the oldest Queen, Victoria, met together. Before 1889, when she traveled to various countries, she always tried as much as possible not to be with adults, but to play with those of similar age.

This trip was really the recreation she needed in addition to her education. The courses she studied were very extensive, including world history, Dutch history, geography, German literature, English and French, cosmology, the Dutch East Indies government, art history, religion, military knowledge, etc. In addition, there were also guidance and practice for future royal affairs, allowing her to participate in official banquets, and later to hold salon dances herself. She also often had the opportunity to deal with various political disputes.

On August 30, 1898, Empress Emma officially retired, and the Queen took office the next day and issued her wishes to the people and her first announcement. In her speech on that day, the Queen said, "I will follow the example of my mother and will follow it for the rest of my life, as I, Princess of the House of Orange, should govern. I will be loyal to our constitution. In the name and flag of our Netherlands, I sincerely say that I am willing to maintain the rule of law in our homeland and in the eastern and western colonies, and I will do my best to seek spiritual and material welfare for these places."

The Queen and her husband had met in Kempten, France, in the year her father died. Since then, there has been no break in their contact. After the Queen and her mother visited the Earl and Countess of Oberg-Schönburg, followed by a visit to Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, everything was decided. On October 16 of that year, the engagement of Queen Wilhelmina and Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was formally announced. On March 5, 1901, the young Queen politically fulfilled her wish, as she said, "I only marry the person I love."

Eight years later, the Queen gave birth to Princess Juliana, and the fears of many years that the Queen had no children and that the House of Orange would end were dispelled. In the eyes of the Dutch people, the birth of Princess Juliana Louise Emma Maria Wilhelmina was a major event in 1909.

During the First World War, the Queen's firm attitude made a deep impression on domestic and foreign public opinion. During these difficult four years, the Netherlands remained neutral throughout, which is an example of its economic and military steadfastness, autonomy, judgment, and independent attitude. Even in the most difficult circumstances, the Netherlands was not drawn into the vortex of world war as Belgium had been. During these four years, she constantly inspired her people, urged them to unite, instructed them to endure the burdens God gave them, and gave them encouragement in times of danger and seriousness. In the end, the people did not disappoint the Queen's expectations, and this serious catastrophe was finally overcome.

Her reign was not an easy thing. She had to overcome economic difficulties, promote national prosperity, and resist military aggression, especially in the last ten years, which were very difficult. When she was nearly sixty years old, Hitler's Nazi army invaded the Netherlands without a declaration of war, and the Queen resolutely ordered the national army and civilians to resist. Although the strength of the two sides was very different, the Netherlands was temporarily occupied by the German army, but the Queen retreated to Britain until the last minute, and would not succumb to the Nazi iron heel. Her courage and perseverance made her even more popular.

During her five years of exile in Britain, the Queen continued to plan and direct the underground workers in the country, making efforts against the Nazis and waiting for her return to her homeland. The people of the country also forever placed their hopes and freedom on the Queen. During this period, she really endured all kinds of hardships, but her wish was finally realized at the end of the war. As soon as the Allied forces entered the Netherlands, she returned to her homeland and began to promote the reconstruction work of the Netherlands.

The Queen's performance during the darkest era in Dutch history was so brilliant that she became one of the greatest rulers in Dutch history. The Queen is now sixty-eight years old, and she has been worried about national affairs for fifty years. This great heroine is really exhausted and needs a chance to rest. Therefore, it has been decided to hand over the arduous reconstruction work that she has already begun to her daughter, Princess Juliana, to continue and complete.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Sternly Instructs Various Sectors: The Government Is Determined to Stabilize the Economy With a Do-or-Die Resolve; Advises Merchants Not to Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened a discussion meeting with responsible individuals from various commercial trade associations in the city. Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Supervisor for the Shanghai District, also attended by invitation to explain the government's policies on price controls and currency reform. Over three hundred responsible individuals from eighty-one commercial trade associations in the city attended, including those from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, hardware, southern goods, northern goods, rice, grains, edible oil, bran, wine and dishes, yarn, cotton cloth, silk fabric, general merchandise, rubber, silk merchants, kerosene, leather, hotels, new medicines, traditional Chinese medicines, and silverware. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau began by reporting, stating briefly: "The government has issued an emergency decree on financial and economic matters, reformed the currency system, and stabilized prices. Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Supervisor for the Shanghai District, will report to you on the government's measures for this new policy, and we also hope to hear your opinions for reference." Wu also encouraged the merchants to assist the government in implementing the policies, and especially hoped that the responsible individuals of each trade association would convey to their members to comply unanimously. After Wu finished speaking, Supervisor Chiang reported, stating: "The new economic policy has been promulgated this time to reform the currency system and stabilize prices, with the aim of eliminating the phenomenon of prices rising daily, the cost of living increasing monthly, the amount of legal tender increasing daily, and the economic crisis becoming increasingly serious. The significance of this matter is equivalent to suppressing bandits on the front lines, because the government's two major tasks at present are to suppress the military rebellion on one hand and stabilize the economy on the other, to safeguard the people's livelihood. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. For a week, the people of the whole country have been paying close attention to the movements of the Shanghai market. Fortunately, the business community in this city has been able to understand the government's measures and unanimously assist the government in implementing the policies. Although there have been very small fluctuations in prices, they are generally stable."

The Three Committees Each Have Their Own Tasks

Chiang also said: "This price control policy is nationwide, starting with stabilizing the market. We will thoroughly control prices and strictly enforce the prices of August 19th, without allowing any changes. To remedy the actual difficulties of various industries, the following steps will be implemented: (1) Establish a Materials Supply Committee to specifically supply materials to the city's market, including industrial raw materials, so as not to cause supply and demand problems. (2) Establish a Price Review Committee to implement the pricing of August 19th, striving to reduce prices, but still seeking a reasonable price so that retailers and wholesalers can obtain legitimate profits. (3) The Economic Inspection Committee is responsible for inspecting warehouses, strictly prohibiting hoarding and speculation." Chiang continued: "Merchants are of varying quality. Recently, when inspecting warehouses, we found cotton yarn and cotton cloth that had been stored since after the victory, almost three years ago." He clearly stated: "In the future, any cotton yarn and cotton cloth stored for more than three months will be confiscated. This is not to make things difficult for merchants, but to enforce orders. As for the difficulties of legitimate merchants, we will definitely provide legal and reasonable solutions, but for illegal merchants, we will resolutely disregard all personal feelings and severely punish them." In short, he hoped to achieve: the government supplies materials as much as possible, prices are reviewed reasonably, and hoarding is strictly inspected. Chiang sincerely hoped that the Shanghai business community would assist and advised all merchants not to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The government is determined to implement the new economic policy with a do-or-die resolve and will thoroughly implement it, hoping to seek stability for the entire country and its people. Chiang pointed out that some rice merchants in the city sell rice for household rations that include broken rice, and the prices of new and traditional Chinese medicines lack standards, which not only violates commercial ethics but should also be condemned by conscience.

### Researching and Printing Price Booklets: People Can Purchase Goods at the Specified Prices; Business Owners Will Be Arrested for Violations; Severe Punishment for Inspection Fraud

Chiang hoped that the Shanghai business community would establish a good atmosphere to serve as a model for the national commerce. He also planned to research with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to print price lists for various daily necessities so that people could purchase at the specified prices, thereby stabilizing people's minds. Chiang finally hoped that various industries would provide opinions.

At this point, Director Wu specifically put forward two points of hope: (1) All stores should uniformly mark the prices of goods, (2) Sales should uniformly issue receipts. Subsequently, responsible individuals from the wine and dish industry, Western food industry, firewood industry, cotton cloth industry, wine and sauce industry, yarn business, kerosene retail industry, milk industry, southern goods industry, and fresh pork industry trade associations expressed their opinions, the main points being: (1) Efforts should be made to channel idle funds into legitimate avenues to avoid the rush to purchase goods. (2) Differentiate prices for retailers and wholesalers in various industries. (3) Assist with transportation. Afterwards, Chiang made a final conclusion: Regarding the issue of idle funds, a concrete method will be implemented soon to provide a home for idle funds. Generally, prices cannot exceed those of August 19th, but it must be done legally, reasonably, and with consideration. Chiang also pointed out: Recently, he had learned that some stores even hired personnel specifically responsible for taking legal action, but in the future, if any business commits illegal acts, the owner will be arrested. He paid close attention to the conduct of inspection personnel, and if any acts of fraud or corruption are discovered, they will be severely punished once discovered. He believed that if government personnel can connect with the people as one and communicate from top to bottom, the new economic policy will surely be implemented smoothly, and prices will surely be stabilized.

### Impartial and Serious: Chiang Ching-kuo Encourages Economic Inspectors To Thoroughly Implement Their Work

In order to thoroughly implement the suppression of prices, crack down on unscrupulous merchants, and implement new economic measures, Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Supervisor of the Shanghai District, especially visited the Municipal Police Bureau at 8:30 AM yesterday to give instructions to all police officers. Over five hundred people attended, including the heads and deputy heads of various branch bureaus, staff of the Economic Inspection Brigade, and other units. Chiang first elaborated on the importance of economic inspection work, stating briefly: "If we want to make the suppression of the rebellion successful, the front line is certainly important, but the economic problems in the rear cannot be neglected. The two must be coordinated in order to achieve success. Therefore, economic inspection work is of great importance to the overall situation, so we must thoroughly implement economic inspection work." Chiang believed that personnel performing this great and arduous work must achieve "no favoritism, clean themselves," and be impartial and serious in order to complete their mission. Chiang then compared the relationship between the police and the people to that of fish and water. The police are like fish, and the people are like water. The police cannot be separated from the people, and the people should also assist the police. Chiang finally hoped that all police officers would cooperate closely with the monetary control authorities so that the economy of the city can be stabilized, and the people's lives can be secured. Mr. Chiang finished speaking and left at around 9 o'clock.

### Huangpu Jurisdiction: Inspecting Public and Private Warehouses

[Report from our newspaper] Feng Wenyao, the chief of Huangpu Police Branch Bureau, under instruction from Bureau Chief Yu, ordered more than thirty officers at around 8:00 AM yesterday to, along with members of the General Bureau’s Economic Task Force, start inspecting dozens of public, private, and underground warehouses within its jurisdiction. There are still seventy or eighty warehouses left that are slated to be inspected by police officers this morning. All goods that have remained in storage for over three months will be sealed and confiscated. It is reported that there are over a hundred warehouses, big and small, in the Huangpu area. Once the inspections are complete, if there are confiscated goods, a comprehensive disclosure will be made.

### The First Company of the Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade Left Shanghai for Wuxi Yesterday Morning

Chiang Ching-kuo recently issued a handwritten order to the Sixth Team of the National Defense Ministry's Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade, which had just been transferred to Shanghai from Tangshan, to dispatch one company quickly to station in Wuxi in order to coordinate and strengthen the implementation of the emergency decree on financial affairs in the Beijing-Shanghai area, and to strike at the unscrupulous merchants concentrated there. The company has now left Shanghai for Wuxi yesterday morning under the command of Company Commander Li Shoujun. According to Mr. Li speaking to a reporter: after they arrive in Wuxi, they will also establish several people's service stations to encourage the people to report, and thoroughly eliminate unscrupulous merchants, bandits, and corrupt officials. In the future, in addition to contacting the Wuxi military and political organs, they will also maintain close contact with Beijing and Shanghai, and will continue to listen to the instructions of the Brigade Headquarters.

### People's Service Stations: Enthusiastic Tips; Mostly Reporting Retailers Raising Prices

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday was the second day that the People's Service Stations of the Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade began work. The citizens of each district went to submit confidential letters with great enthusiasm. The opening of a portion of the confidential report boxes at noon resulted in more than one hundred letters, but most of them were reporting retailers raising prices, with very few revealing those who were speculating and hoarding. Chiang Ching-kuo went to the Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade to look over these letters and instructed that minor cases be sent to the Economic Police Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau for handling, while major cases be sent to the office of the Economic Supervisor. Because the confidential report boxes are distributed across a vast area, the second opening time each day is still at midnight. The staff of the Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade, in addition to investigating based on confidential letters, are not responsible for enforcement. However, starting today, the team will dispatch another fifty team members to cooperate with the economic police to assist in inspection work.

Also, in order to encourage people to submit confidential reports, in addition to the confidential report boxes set up at the people's service stations in each district accepting letters from citizens as usual, citizens who do not wish to reveal their identity by submitting letters can send confidential reports with accusations or suggestions directly to "Shanghai Shen Zi No. 7009 Post Office Box".

### Redemption of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency: One-Day Total Value Exceeds Ten Million Yuan

Hong Kong dollars: 479,839.75 dollars

The total value is 12,088,134.98 Gold Yuan.

### Eleven Business Establishments Found to Have Exceeded Price Limits

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the police bureau uncovered a total of eleven cases of various business establishments exceeding the price limits: (1) The Yingfa pharmacy at No. 87 Yunnan Road was selling Kefa white pine sugar at a marked price of 7 million yuan per bottle. Cui Dechang, an employee of the Tianzhang Department Store on Fujian Road, discovered that the Zhengweihua pharmacy was selling it for only 4.5 million yuan per bottle, and reported it to the Laoza Police Branch. After an investigation was conducted, the person in charge of the pharmacy was detained and transferred to the General Bureau for investigation. (2) The Jinxiangfu fashion shop at No. 22 Nanjing West Road changed the price of a raincoat from the old price of 54 million legal tender to 19.5 Gold Yuan. (3) The Yakai silk and cloth store at No. 68 on the same road increased the selling price of Hong Kong hemp cloth. (4) The Jinmen store at No. 80 Zhou Road was selling fleece at a price exceeding the limit. (5) The Tianlong Company at No. 246 on the same road was selling ribbon for 17.1 million yuan per yard, up from the previous price of 15 million yuan. In addition, the Xinli shoe company, Lida shoe company, Buyun shoe store, and Xinle Department Store in the Jingu Commercial Market, as well as the Shengji Commercial Firm at No. 304 Zhengzheng North Road and the Luolan store on the same road, were all found to have exceeded the price limits. The people in charge of each business were taken to the bureau by the police for questioning and will be punished according to law.

### The Social Affairs Bureau's Price Review Meeting Reduced Interest Rates for Pawnshops, and Ordered Various Industries to Comply With Price Limits

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau continued to convene various industries in the city to hold a price review meeting: (1) For the pawnshop industry, the original interest rate was as high as 5 to 8 jiao per month, and there were so-called warehouse rent fees and handling fees. Section Chief Zhang of the Social Affairs Bureau instructed that the interest rate should be reduced after the currency reform, and ordered it to be reduced to 2.1 jiao per month. The warehouse rent and handling fees remained the same, and they would be ordered to reduce them month by month in the future. (2) For the sauce and wine industry, there are about 2,000 members of this industry in the city. In the past, prices were set freely, so the prices on August 19th varied from store to store. The Social Affairs Bureau instructed that they should first sell at the prices set by each store on August 19th and not exceed the limit. As for unified prices, another meeting will be held within the next few days to discuss them. (3) For the stationery industry, the pencil manufacturer increased the price on August 18th, but the store front did not change the code on August 19th. If the store front sells at the old price, the retail price will be too low. After the Social Affairs Bureau decided, the pencil front sale will still be at the August 19th price, and the factory price will be at the August 8th price. (4) For Chinese and foreign mixed cloth merchants, in the past, retailers were used to paying with checks when purchasing cloth from the factory, so the price was higher. Retail sales were all in cash, so the price was lower. If the retail price is lower than the wholesale price according to the August 19th price, after the currency reform, all wholesale sales will require cash. If the retail price is not increased, there will be a loss. The Social Affairs Bureau still rigidly stipulates that the August 19th price limit should be followed. If there are any problems, they will be resolved later. (5) For the theater industry, some Yue Opera or Shanghai Opera theaters adjusted ticket prices after the cost-of-living index was released on August 15th, while others did not adjust them in time. For example, the Nine Stars Theater only increased the price after August 19th, and requested permission to add the increase. The Social Affairs Bureau feared that opening this example would have a great impact, so it instructed them to strictly abide by the August 19th price limit and not exceed it. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau scheduled a meeting with theater industry leaders on September 2nd, and will invite representatives from the police and finance bureaus to participate at that time.

### Will Send Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate Price Increase Among Chinese and Western Doctors

Some citizens sent confidential letters to the Social Affairs Bureau, reporting that many famous Chinese and Western doctors in the city increased the gold yuan equivalent of the registration fee for outpatient visits after the currency reform, without following the August 19th price list, and requested that this be stopped. The Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to thoroughly investigate separately.

### Securities Speculation Before Currency Reform: Two Supervisory Committee Members Are Conducting an Investigation; Will Announce the Truth Before Returning to Nanjing to Report

The two have been working actively in Shanghai for several days and have gained a lot. Yesterday, Supervisory Committee Member Sun told reporters that although a lot of information has been obtained on this case so far, the investigation work still needs to be carried out. After the investigation work comes to an end, before colleagues return to Nanjing to report, they will definitely announce the truth about this case.

It is also learned that Yu Peihou, Ni Bi, and Qing Shen'an, the members of the Supervisory Committee Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang District, which will be established tomorrow, also attach great importance to this case and have decided to dispatch personnel from the Office to investigate within the next few days, so that the truth of this case can be revealed as soon as possible.

### All Three Escapees From Shanghai Prison Captured: Chen Yuansheng Escaped For Six Days But Could Not Escape Death

[Report from our newspaper] Chen Yuansheng, a major criminal sentenced to life imprisonment in the Central Bank gold brick theft case, and two other thieves, Jiang Jixiang and Wang Hailiang, escaped from the fifth floor of Shanghai Prison in the morning of the 24th of this month during a heavy rainstorm. After the prison break, the security authorities sent out detectives in all directions, and finally announced that all of them had been captured by 11 p.m. last night.

After this case occurred, the Police Bureau first interrogated Liu Aliuyi, a thief who was in the same prison but did not escape, and carefully studied the evidence left behind, such as the hacksaw blade and cotton yarn belt. Liu confessed that he had heard Chen and Jiang discussing their escape plan, preparing to go to Baiyun Jing and take Jiang's uncle's own wooden boat to Jurong. Police officers rushed to Pudong and blockaded the Bailian Jing area, but found nothing. They then went to Jiang's father's lime shop at No. 313 Lujia Ferry and inquired about the residences of Jiang's relatives and friends, searching each one. Finally, they captured Jiang at Huan Yunxiang's house, Jiang's cousin-in-law, at No. 5 Niqiangquan, Zhao Jiazhai.

At the same time, the police bureau learned that Wang Hailiang's address was No. 73 Tongan Lane, Taixing Road, and went there, only encountering Wang's mother and wife. After questioning, they had no clue. Then they went to Jiang Longlong, Wang's uncle, at No. 15 Tan Jiazhai, Zhabei, to inquire. Jiang said that Wang had been there, and now he may be living in Yang Ronglin's house, the husband of his wife's younger sister, at No. 25, Lane 455, Jianguo East Road. Yang is a drug dealer. Police officers rushed to the address on the 28th and found Wang there. It is said that he had only arrived an hour earlier, so he was caught without resistance.

The above situation has been recorded in our newspaper. As for Chen Yuansheng's whereabouts, because he is usually scheming, police officers had long expected that it would be difficult to detect him, but after several days and nights of joint research and visits, he was finally captured. It is reported that the locations visited by Chen reached as many as sixteen. The Meitai Printing Bureau at No. 119 Zhapu Road, owned by Yang Chichang, a Cantonese, is one of them. Chen and Yang are very friendly, so police officers paid the most attention to this place. However, Chen was unusually cunning and did not go there even once. The police bureau then printed a photo of Chen and distributed it in large quantities to various teahouses, wine shops, and public places, ordering everyone to pay attention at any time. Soon, a friend of police officer Ma Bingzhang reported that the person in the photo looked very familiar and seemed to frequent the Jingu Village area on Zhengzheng South Second Road, and his actions were secretive. Around 6 p.m. last night, a large number of police officers were dispatched to wait near Jingu Village. At around 11 p.m. late at night, under the dim street lights, they encountered a person similar to Chen in Jingu Village Lane. Section Chief Feng Qishan returned and ordered him to show his ID card. The man said that the card was at home. Section Chief Feng immediately took out the photo for comparison, and it was indeed Chen. At this point, Chen also said, "Are you Feng Qishan?" He answered yes. Chen immediately said, "There is nothing to say, it is also destiny." So he was bound and taken to the bureau. When Chen was captured, he was wearing a light blue Hong Kong shirt, old yellow long suit pants, and white leather shoes. His hair was already gray, and he had a short beard, with a natural attitude. According to reports, after escaping, he had seen a movie once in Shemei. Because he had no money, he could not go far and slept on the streets every night. According to general estimates, Chen was originally sentenced to life imprisonment, and this time he may inevitably be sentenced to death.

In addition to Section Chief Feng, patrol officer Qin Boliang, police officer Ma Bingzhang, police officer Guo Yuping, Liu Zhaolong, and Chen Guangrong were also at the scene when he was captured, and they congratulated each other for solving the major case.

### Participating in the Seventh General Assembly: Decided to Convene on September 9; The Focus of Discussion in this Session Will be on Rent Issues and Tuition Standards

The seventh general assembly of the first session of the Municipal Council has been decided by Chairman Pan to convene on September 9th. The Secretariat of the General Assembly notified the Municipal Government yesterday to expedite the re-compilation of the budget for the 37th year and submit it to the relevant groups for preliminary review. The detailed agenda of the conference is being compiled by the secretariat of the council and will be announced within the next few days. It is reported that the conference was originally scheduled to be held in early October. The advance of the conference should be due to the need to address certain temporary problems arising after the currency reform. It is widely believed that the issue of rent standards is closely related to local tax revenue and must be resolved quickly, which will be the focus of discussion in this session of the conference. The tuition standards for public and private primary and secondary schools in the current semester, which were announced a few days ago, far exceed the central government's regulations, and will also cause expected fierce debate. However, the issue of public utility prices will be uniformly formulated by the Executive Yuan after the currency reform, and the competent authorities can stay out of this session of the conference.

### Public Utility Investigation Committee: Reviews the Waterworks Section; Various Companies Answered Depreciation and Other Issues

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Public Utility Price Public Investigation and Review Committee held its fourth meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 4:30 PM yesterday. In addition to the various committee members present, Laurent from the French Water and Electricity Company, Locke from the British Water Company, Zhao Wenxiang from the Mainland Water Company, and Cheng Xu from the Pudong Water Plant were also present. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting and first explained that the purpose of this meeting was to review the waterworks section and asked the various committee members to express their opinions.

The British Shanghai Waterworks Company was first reviewed. Qu Yue, Shao Yongsheng, Li Wenjie and others inquired about the company's amortization loss figures, asset and liability status, management fees, depreciation, and dividends. The person in charge of the company answered one by one, with the general meaning: (1) The amortization loss figure includes the number of dividends owed, and the actual amortization loss is not as large as it appears on the books. (2) Management fees include some operating expenses in addition to salaries. (3) Depreciation expenses were affected by the large exchange rate adjustment in May and June. (4) In terms of dividends, the company has actually stopped paying dividends invisibly since the 30th year of the Republic of China. This situation is very different from the pre-war standard of setting interest rates and paying interest. After the British Shanghai Waterworks Company's review was completed, the commercial waterworks company was reviewed. You Xun zhao, Jiang, and others inquired about the company's restoration costs and salary benefits, and the company replied that the company's restoration costs were very small and that its business situation has been better since the 34th year of the Republic of China. The salary benefits of employees last year and this year are different because the base has been raised. Then, the Mainland, Zhabei, and Chinese Waterworks Companies were reviewed, and inquiries were made about salaries, public welfare expenses, welfare expenses, and disinfection fees. The meeting did not break up until after 6 p.m. It was decided that the fifth meeting will be held on September 6 to review the various gas companies, Shanghai Telephone Company, and public transportation companies.

### Hotel Lays a Trap; Gold Speculator Arrested During Transaction; Wei Boxiang and Others to be Escorted Away Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] The police bureau's economic police brigade cracked a black market gold trading case yesterday, seizing four large gold bars on the spot. The suspect, Tang Jiye, was arrested and interrogated and will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for legal proceedings today. Tang is a well-known gold speculator, and his usual business contact address is supposedly inside the Dahua Company at 149 Sichuan Road. The police bureau learned of this three days ago and immediately dispatched officers to investigate. Yesterday morning, team leader Lou Chenghan disguised himself as a customer and negotiated to purchase ten gold bars, at a black market price of 2,020 Gold Yuan per bar, agreeing to complete the transaction at 4:00 PM in room 348 of the Oriental Hotel. When Tang arrived carrying only four gold bars, the police officers already stationed in the room saw that the time was right, revealed their identities, and arrested him.

In addition, three Chinese and foreign gold black market offenders, Wei Boxiang, Mei Ji, and Ai Qier, who were recently arrested by the brigade, have been detained and investigated, and the case is nearing completion. It is expected that they will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court today after the confession records and investigation reports are organized.

### Three Companies' Currency Exchange Case; Two Companies' Arguments Concluded; Investigation of Sanwei's Portion to be Handled Separately

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of suspected private operation of black market gold and currency exchange involving Lin Wang, Sanwei, and Dahua companies was heard again at the Special Criminal Court at 10:00 AM yesterday. Before the hearing, Presiding Judge Wang Zhennan stated that because the three companies were arrested and interrogated together initially, the hearings had not been separated. As the investigation into Sanwei Company's portion has not yet been completed, and the company has requested that Ru Wei be summoned for questioning, the arguments would proceed for Lin Wang and Dahua companies first. Zhang Yansheng of Dahua Company, and Wang Chunzhe, Zheng Ligong, and Lin Tongshi of Lin Wang Company were then summoned as defendants and questioned. At that time, Yuan Yusheng, an accountant from Dahua Company, also appeared in court to explain the accounting situation and requested that the company's accounts with the Hong Kong office be carefully verified in court.

Wang Chunzhe, the person in charge of Lin Wang Company, admitted to hiring the wrong person and stated that all responsibility should be borne by Zheng Jiayu, the company's deputy manager, who is currently at large. Lin Tongshi stated that he has been engaged in chemical research for more than ten years, so he was recruited by Shenglian Import and Export to engage in the import of chemical raw materials and did not participate in the business of Lin Wang Company. Zheng Ligong also stated that his salary was only 40 yuan, which was actually 8.44 million yuan according to the April index, as can be seen from the accounts, so his position was not actually the assistant manager of Lin Wang Company.

At 11:30 AM, the court ordered the start of the arguments. Ji Hemen, the lawyer for Zhang Yansheng, requested that the court summon the accountant from Dahua Company's Hong Kong office and a Nanyang film merchant to testify in court. Du Kaoxiang, the defense lawyer for Wang Chunzhe, argued on behalf of the defendant that all of Lin Wang Company's vouchers were signed by the manager, Zheng Jiayu, and Wang should not be responsible for Zheng's personal actions.

Lawyer Wei Pingfan, appointed to defend Lin Tongshi, stated that the Social Bureau had already issued an official letter proving that Lin was not a partner of Lin Wang Company. Also, according to Wang Chunzhe's confession record, it was proved that Lin was not the person in charge of the company's Shantou branch. Lin Tongshi also worked part-time for Liansheng Import and Export, whose real boss was Wang Chunzhe, so Lin also deposited a small number of funds into the company to earn interest, as can be seen from the accounts, and he was definitely not engaged in black market gold trading.

At 1:00 PM, the arguments concluded. The court then ordered that the Dahua Company's portion be investigated further, and if there were no doubts, the arguments would be concluded without rescheduling, and a verdict would be issued at a later date. The arguments for Lin Wang Company's portion concluded yesterday, and a date was set for the verdict.

### Yi Feng Jin Rice Shop Penalized for Malpractice; People's Food Allocation Committee Decides to Suspend Distribution

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yi Feng Jin Rice Shop, located at 119 Nanhui Street, Penglai District, was reported for suspected malpractice in rice distribution. After receiving the report, the People's Food Allocation Committee approved the request from Section Chief Cai of the committee's management section to Director Lu of the allocation office to suspend rice distribution as a penalty. The shop was previously reported by nearby residents for allegedly obtaining a large number of rice ration coupons through illegal means and then reselling the rice obtained from the People's Food Allocation Committee for profit. After investigation by Zhao Bingwen, chairman of the district people's representative assembly, more than 300 completely new blank rice ration coupons were found in the shop's cash register drawer. These coupons did not have the district, bao, or jia households written on them and were all serially numbered, indicating that they were not owned by residents but were obtained from the agency responsible for issuing the rice ration coupons. The district people's representatives then invited Si Pu, a commissioner from the People's Food Allocation Committee stationed in Penglai District, to conduct an inspection on the spot. Commissioner Si then confirmed that the shop had also illegally sold household rice past the deadline. The People's Food Allocation Committee stipulated that the distribution date should end on the 25th of each month and that extensions should not be granted without special reasons and approval. The shop continued to sell rice after the 26th without permission, violating the committee's regulations and showing suspicion of malpractice. Commissioner Si then reported the situation to the People's Food Allocation Committee. When the reporter visited Section Chief Cai of the committee's management section yesterday, he said that he had already signed a request to Director Lu yesterday to suspend the shop's distribution of household rice starting from this period as a penalty.

### Director Tian Returns to Shanghai After Consulting on City's Financial Problems

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tian Yongchou, director of the Finance Bureau, returned to Shanghai by train on the night of the 29th, having gone to the central government in Beijing to consult on the city's financial problems. Yesterday, he reported to reporters on his trip to Beijing, saying that the central government's recently promulgated supplementary measures for reorganizing finances did not mention local finances. He went to Beijing to consult on tax rates and other issues. Minister Wang informed him that they were still being drafted, and there would be no major changes to the tax rates, but there would be slight changes to the penalty rules. Local governments would have the authority to adjust tax rates.

The city government is unable to bear the employees' salaries for the second half of August, and the central government does not intend to provide subsidies. The Finance Bureau is very concerned about this and has decided to borrow the shortfall from the Central Bank in advance, and the funds will be distributed to employees within two or three days.

Fifth Resignation Request

According to reliable sources: Director Tian has formally submitted his resignation to Mayor Wu. Director Tian has repeatedly requested to resign due to the city's extreme financial difficulties, but his requests have not been approved. This is his fifth resignation request. He believes that the city's finances may improve slightly after the currency reform, so he intends to take the opportunity to retire.

### Director of Fifth Refugee Shelter Accused of Embezzling Rice, Oil, and Sugar

### Case of Sudden Death of Woman in Huangdu Township; Coffin Opened for Autopsy; Officials Flee

[Our Newspaper's Report from Qingpu, 29th] The case of Shen Pang Guiying, a woman from Huangdu Township, who died suddenly while detained by the Qinglong District Office, has caused a sensation throughout the county. Yesterday, a forensic doctor, Xuan Fang, was dispatched from the Jiangsu High Court to Qingpu to open the coffin and conduct an autopsy at the cemetery outside the North Altar. Details of the case are as follows:

Shen Pang Guiying, "27 years old," wife of Shen Wei, a resident of Tangwan, Fourth Bao, Huangdu Town, had an argument with her sister-in-law, surnamed Xu, on the 16th of last month over a trivial matter. Both went to the Qinglong District Office to request a ruling. As a result, Pang Guiying was illegally detained by the District Office. Afterward, Xu regretted her actions, and the Baojia chief and others guaranteed Pang's release. On the morning of the 17th, Pang suddenly died in the District Office. At the time, the District Office claimed that she had hanged herself and ordered her family to collect the body. Shen Wei, the deceased's husband, was working at a cargo company in Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Upon hearing of the incident, he rushed home and examined his wife's body. He discovered that Pang's vulva was swollen and everted like a pomegranate, the inner skin of the labia minora was ruptured, and the uterine canal was filled with a white fluid that was flowing out. There were blue bruises on her neck, waist, ribs, and abdomen, and numerous fingernail marks on her throat and chest. The situation was extremely tragic. At that time, the neighbors gathered, and because of the bizarre circumstances of Pang's death, everyone believed that she may have been raped to death. The public was indignant, and Shen Wei was in extreme grief. He appealed to all sectors and filed a complaint with the county's judicial office, accusing Xu Jiwu, the Qinglong District Chief, of causing death by injury. On the 19th of the same month, the judicial office dispatched personnel, and Judge Liao Bin and County Chief Yao Jinghan went to the township to investigate. On the 29th of last month, a court hearing was held. According to the statements of the accused District Chief Xu Jiwu and Luo Zhanyun, the squad leader of the standing team, who was heavily suspected, Pang hanged herself. Guan Zumao, the judicial office's coroner, also reported that it was a suicide. Shen Wei and the Baojia chiefs and other people who testified gave their accounts of what they had seen. Shen Wei also presented a pair of soiled pants stained with blood, which had been removed from the deceased's body, as evidence, and requested a re-examination, pointing out that the coroner, Lan, who had examined the body only examined the upper body and not the lower body, which was a sign of malpractice, and wrongly determined that it was a suicide. The judicial office then telephoned the Jiangsu High Court to dispatch a forensic doctor to Qingpu for an examination to determine the truth. The personnel appearing in court at the time were ordered to return separately, and the criminal portion of Xu Jiwu and others was to be investigated further by the office. After this case occurred, public opinion unanimously believed that the District Office had no right to illegally detain people and could not escape responsibility. Judge Liao stated, "The rape portion will be determined pending examination. Even if it was a suicide, the District Office should be held legally responsible for obstructing freedom and causing death." Later, the Provincial Government Supervision Group came to Qingpu on the 13th of this month. Shen Wei told them about the incident and requested that it be handled. Group Leader Dong ordered the county government to detain squad leader Luo Zhanyun, who was highly suspected of committing the crime (Luo was a retired military officer dispatched by the province). More than 40 days have passed since the incident. A week ago, the Jiangsu High Court telegraphed the county to dispatch forensic doctor Xuan Fang to Qingpu for examination. Unexpectedly, Guan Zumao, the judicial office's coroner who had previously examined the body, suddenly fled without a trace in the middle of this month. Furthermore, Chen Guangchong, the clerk handling the case, also suddenly left his post a few days before the forensic doctor arrived in Qingpu, and his whereabouts are unknown (Liao Bin, the original judge, was transferred by the High Court on the 18th of this month, and Wang Jiyuan was appointed to replace him). People outside were talking about it. The new Judge Wang stated that he would uphold the spirit of the judiciary and thoroughly investigate the case to make the truth clear. The Provincial High Court has been asked to dismiss the fleeing officials. On the 25th, the forensic doctor arrived in Qingpu and scheduled Shen Wei to transport his wife's coffin to Qingpu on the 28th for examination. This major case, which had attracted attention from all sides, was opened and examined at the cemetery outside the North Gate at 10:00 AM yesterday. For a time, the onlookers were a sea of people. Many neighbors from Pang's residence in Huangdu walked to the city to watch the examination. After the coffin was opened, a foul odor filled the air, causing people to cover their noses. The corpse had already decomposed. The forensic doctor then removed the bones for examination, which caused those who saw it to feel sad. Examination results: There was a 1.7-inch long, 0.6-inch wide, deep red wound on the root bone of the right ear; the right and left humerus were red; the right and left arm bones and spleen bone were red; the fingertips of the right and left hand bones were red; the right and left 24 ribs and leg bones were red; the left tibia and right tibia were also red, all with traces of injury. The hyoid bone had rotted away, and 14 of the 16 lower teeth were red, indicating that there had been struggle and heavy pressure before death, resulting in the above-mentioned injuries. (The skin and flesh of the vulva had rotted away, leaving only the skeletal frame). The examination was completed in the afternoon. Forensic doctor Xuan returned to Suzhou that day. According to him, based on the fact that the bones of the lower body were red, it could be presumed that it was a suicide, but the waist, ribs, and skull also showed obvious signs of injury, indicating that the cause of death was not simple. The examination report will be written after the forensic doctor returns to Suzhou, and the facts of the case will then become clear. According to Shen Wei, he and his wife were deeply in love, and he swore that he would seek justice for his wife who had suffered such a wrong.

[Our Newspaper's Report from Zhenjiang, 29th] The case of Dr. Gao Enpei killing Han Qing, the director of the Zhongzhou Barber Shop, with a needle, which caused a sensation throughout the province, has been investigated by Section Chief Shi of the Health Department. The major case of reckless disregard for human life was finally not pursued. The deceased's wife, Ren Weishi, is destitute and has two children and is also pregnant. She is extremely pessimistic about her future life, so she filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Gao of negligent homicide. The District Prosecutor's Office opened a special investigation court on the 28th. After the arguments, the court ordered that the witnesses had not arrived, and scheduled a continuation of the hearing. In addition to paying a cash bail of 10,000 yuan, the accused, Gao Enpei, also provided a shop as a guarantor.

### Successful Purebred Rice Seeds in Jiaxing: The First Sound of Increased Production in Zhejiang Province - Holding a Field Exhibition

— Our Correspondent Chen Jianxiong

[Our Jiaxing dispatch, 29th] Under the slogan of increasing production, improving crop varieties, and researching agricultural technology, the Bazixiang area of Jiaxing expressed great satisfaction and confidence in the increased yield of the newly promoted 6506 purebred early indica rice. Therefore, on the 28th, a grand "Field Exhibition" was held. This novel exhibition was truly eye-opening, especially as it was held amidst calls for disaster relief everywhere.

Various bountiful agricultural products and new types of agricultural tools were displayed at the meeting. A solemn ceremony was held. In addition to offering condolences, the officials explained that the government was constantly trying to "increase rural production and improve the lives of farmers," urging farmers to focus on water conservancy, winter plowing, and prohibiting gambling, and assisting the government in eliminating the communist bandits, only then could they have "good days to live!" The farmers were very excited and applauded thunderously.

According to the farmers themselves, the yield of the 6506 purebred rice seeds, compared with the local rice varieties with the same fertilization, increased by more than five dou per mu. The reporter compared the two different early rice ears in the field, and it was indeed surprising. The difference in size was more than double. The purebred rice ears were solid, with more than two hundred grains per ear. Two ears of local early rice could not match it. No wonder the farmers were extremely excited, and the government officials were all gratified.

### Prospects for Cotton Textile Production in Three Townships of Zhenhai

[Our Zhenhai dispatch, 29th] The Gongyitang of Dongguan, Xiguan, and Qianxu Townships in Zhenhai, with the aim of establishing public welfare undertakings, revitalizing the countryside, increasing production, and improving customs, has repaired seawalls, bridges, roads, dredged rivers, etc. since its establishment. Although it has not been long, the results have been remarkable. The villagers who have benefited are all grateful. If the cotton textile production plan can be realized in the future, the future is immeasurable.

Current Local Situation

The three townships have a small area and a large population, and production is insufficient. Many villagers go out to make a living, not only is the land barren, but it is also occupied by graves everywhere, and the cultivated land is shrinking day by day. During the war, the three townships suffered greatly, and it will not be possible to restore the old appearance in the short term. Therefore, even more people go out, and the rural economy becomes even poorer. As a result, farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy. To save this economic crisis, it is necessary to expand the cultivated land area, establish factories, and increase production to provide sufficient employment. Therefore, there has long been a plan to build dikes and silt up the two gaps from Zhaobao Mountain to Hutun Mountain and from Hutun Mountain to Liyou Mountain in Zhenhai, so that the area along the Wanggongtang will be filled with silt, extending beyond You Mountain. Along the coast from Zhaobao Mountain, Hutun Mountain, You Mountain, and Qiliyu to the north through Xiepu, Wolong Mountain, and directly to Andong (opposite Zhapu) in Yuyao, the total length is 180 li and the width is more than 10 li. By building seawalls around it, at least 1.5 million mu of vast plains can be obtained in two or three years. If artificial freshwater storage methods are added, it will not be difficult to turn it into fertile land. In the future, establishing farms and using mechanical and scientific farming methods, everyone can happily work, and large-scale production of cotton, wheat, and beans can be expected. If construction can be gradually and continuously carried out, in ten years, it will not be difficult to become a new and prosperous industrial, agricultural, and commercial city, making a great contribution to the local area and the country.

American Cotton Trial Planting

Yao, Ci, and Zhen counties have jointly trial-planted 230,000 mu of Tuozi cotton and Dezi cotton. The Gongyitang has established a self-operated experimental cotton field on the newly alluviated saline soil on the coast, and has been trial-planting Dezi cotton. In just three years, the harvest results have been very impressive. The figures are as follows:

First year: 30 jin of seed cotton. Second year: 100 jin of seed cotton. Third year: 150 jin of seed cotton. Fourth year: 200 jin of seed cotton (estimated).

Yuyao originally had 600,000 mu of cotton fields, and Cixi and Zhenhai had 200,000 mu. After the planned dike construction from Zhenhai to Andong is successful, at least 1.5 million mu can be added, totaling 2.3 million mu. In addition, a large amount of cotton has been planted in recent years in the siltation near Chuanshan, Meishan, Taohua, Liuheng, and various islands outside Zhenhai, with an annual harvest of 50,000 dan, which is not included in this number. According to the current trial planting results of American cotton, the total number of cotton fields is 2.3 million mu, and the yield of seed cotton per mu is 200 jin, the total output of seed cotton is 460 million jin or 4.6 million dan.

Increase Production

In order to promote the wisdom of the sages and take into account the coordination of production and sales, it is planned to establish 30 spinning mills in Yao, Ci, and Zhen counties, each with 10,000 spindles. According to the efficiency of the latest spinning machines, each spindle requires more than one pound of cotton per day. By using local materials, the total output of this area is sufficient for the annual use of 30 spinning mills, with a surplus. There are more than a thousand large and small factories for weaving, printing, dyeing, power generation, machinery, oil extraction, and packaging, as well as affiliated industries. After the cotton harvest, one season of beans, wheat, and vegetables can be planted, and the benefits of this have not been calculated. In addition to self-sufficiency, the production of the three townships can also supply the needs of neighboring provinces. Once the industry in this township is developed, the number of workers will inevitably increase. The lack of food can be exchanged for salt from Andong, and rice from Jiangxi can be exchanged to supply what is needed, benefiting both sides. Internally, production is increased and unemployment is reduced. Externally, the export of yarn and cloth is promoted, increasing foreign exchange income. Enriching the country and benefiting the people is related to the national economy, and it is not just the three townships that benefit. Osaka, Japan, does not produce half a cotton plant, but its textile industry can still dominate the world. Now, the land in the three townships can be fully utilized, and the raw materials are readily available. If it can be implemented step by step according to the plan, can it not keep pace with and surpass it?

### Cargo Owners Are Firmly Bullish: Rice Continues to Rise; Flour and Edible Oil Both Decline

The price of rice continues to rise, because the prices in other places are high, the cargo owners are very firm, and the money supply is very loose. There are very few sellers. Moreover, the price has not yet reached the price limit. Buyers are taking advantage of the low prices, and the sales are very active. The price of early rice in Beishi is 21.6 yuan, and the price of white japonica rice in both the north and south cities is 20.05 yuan, each rising 5 or 6 jiao. The price of low-grade rice has risen by 1 yuan, and the market is still bullish at the close. Coarse indica rice is very popular, and the closing price is even higher. Yesterday, a total of 3,544 shi arrived in the north and south cities.

The price of flour has turned down. It is rumored that warehouse receipts for more than three months will be confiscated like yarn and cloth, and people are very panicked. Those who hold old warehouse receipts are taking the opportunity to sell them, and the supply has increased sharply. The price has fallen. Old Chebing ship and miscellaneous brand flour have all fallen to the price limit, each falling 4 to 5 jiao. Bing ship flour has fallen below 7 yuan, to 6.8 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng have all fallen below 7 yuan. Wheat bran has also been reduced by 5 fen, and wheat mills are trading at 10.3 yuan.

The miscellaneous grains market is still firm, but it is still holding the price limit. Transactions are becoming rare due to the lack of supply. Because the money supply is very loose, cargo owners do not want to sell. Soybeans are still traded at the price limit. Corn is being purchased by the Yantai gang, rising 5 to 6 jiao. Red sorghum is trading at 9 yuan, and naked barley has a few transactions, and the market is also trending firm. Broad beans are in short supply and transactions are rare. Cargo owners are reluctant to sell sesame seeds, and the market is firm. Raw peanuts are traded at the price limit.

The price of edible oil has declined slightly, because the ban on exports has been announced, and people feel very empty. Many retail investors are returning to the market to sell. The initial price of soybean oil was 51 yuan, and the closing price fell to 50.05 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan. Rapeseed oil also fell by 1 yuan to 46 yuan.

### The Tea Market Is Quietly Bullish

Recently, the trend of the foreign tea market has repeatedly shown signs of improvement. Green tea has benefited greatly from the government's announcement of currency system reform and the redefinition of foreign exchange, which has greatly benefited exports. Unfortunately, the current inventory of various goods is limited, and the production price has been rising all the way. Therefore, transactions have not been active, but the price can be said to be stable. According to general opinion, the foreign tea market is not in danger. As for domestic sales of fancy tea, although the holders are firm in selling, the stores in this street feel that the inventory is still abundant, and the authorities are strictly controlling prices these days, so they are not eager to purchase more. The process is characterized by little buying or selling, and a quiet bullishness.

### Jinan University Professor in Saigon - Discusses Overseas Chinese Students' Education Problems

[Report from the Central News Agency, Saigon, 29th] Jinan University in Shanghai recently sent Professor Liu Xianwei to Saigon to recruit overseas Chinese students. This is the first time a domestic university has sent a representative to Nanyang to recruit overseas Chinese students. The local Chinese community warmly welcomes Mr. Liu. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Saigon hosted a tea reception this morning, and various difficulties encountered by overseas Chinese students returning to China for education were discussed during the meeting. There are three main points: (1) Most overseas Chinese high school graduates who wish to return to China for further education have no relatives or friends in the country. The Chinese community believes that special organizations should be established in major cities in China to receive overseas Chinese students and inform them of the necessary knowledge for their continued education. (2) Overseas Chinese high school graduates are generally less proficient than domestic students. To encourage them to return to China to study, domestic universities should reserve a quota for overseas Chinese first-year students who are exempted from entrance examinations. If examinations are required, the admission standards should also be set separately. Even if they do not pass the examination, remedial classes should be set up to accommodate them. (3) Due to domestic inflation and difficult student living conditions, and some universities lack adequate facilities, all overseas Chinese hope that the current currency reform will be successful. The government should provide all possible conveniences for remittances for those with children studying in China.

### "Wen Su Ge" Collection of Books - Decision Made to Postpone Relocation

[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] According to the Ministry of Education: Only four collections of the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries" (Si Ku Quan Shu) currently remain (originally there were seven: Wen Yuan, Wen Hui, Wen Zong, Wen Yuan, Wen Jin, Wen Su, and Wen Lan). The books of the first three were destroyed during the invasion of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance and during the Taiping Rebellion. The Wen Yuan Pavilion is currently located in the Palace Museum, the Wen Jin Pavilion in the National Beiping Library, the Wen Lan Pavilion in the Hangzhou Provincial Library, and the Wen Su Pavilion in the National Shenyang Museum. Previously, due to the abnormal environment in the Northeast, it was originally planned to transport the books of the Wen Su Pavilion to Nanjing for temporary safekeeping, and then transport them back after the area was pacified. Now that the situation in the Northeast has become more stable, it has been decided to postpone the relocation temporarily.

### Public Swimming Competition - Chinese and Western Athletes - Fierce Competition - Xu Heng Loses 50-Meter Race to Burt - Westerners Grab Four of Seven Championships

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Open Swimming Competition, jointly organized by the Jiangwan and Hongkou Municipal Swimming Pools and the Swimming Committee of the Municipal Sports Association, concluded successfully yesterday afternoon after three hours of competition. The overall results were satisfactory. However, it is a pity that four of the seven finals were won by Westerners, prompting concerns about the lack of swimming talent. Except for the temporary cancellation of the diving performance in the men's group, all events proceeded smoothly. On the women's side, only three participants originally registered. Liu Tianchun was stranded in Hong Kong and could not return in time, and Long Huixia suddenly fell slightly ill. Only Zhao Qinying arrived at the venue, so the organizers announced in accordance with the regulations that all women's events would be canceled. This greatly disappointed the audience who were hoping to see the "mermaid" in action. The stands of the Jiangwan National Games Swimming Pool were quite lively with approximately one thousand men, women, and children.

The competition started twenty minutes later than originally scheduled. In the first event, the 1500-meter freestyle, Xu Shouqiang, a well-known middle-aged athlete, led from start to finish, completing the course in 28 minutes and 13.4 seconds, leaving the second-place finisher 75 meters behind. Wu Dingjian was in third place in the first half, surpassing Lin Qi in the sidestroke at 900 meters to take second place.

The 50-meter freestyle was one of the most intense events of the competition. The tall Xu Heng and the black athlete Kelly Burt are both experts in this event and easily took first place in their respective preliminary groups. In the final, they both gave it their all. Xu Heng was slower to enter the water, so Burt was ahead by a margin for the first 30 meters. Xu then buried his head and chased hard, gradually catching up. It was almost impossible to tell who was ahead when they reached the finish line. However, Xu Heng misjudged the distance between his fingers and the edge of the pool. When his fingers were still a few inches from the finish line, he stopped stroking, allowing Burt to touch the finish line first. The difference of an inch caused the championship to be handed over, to the regret of hundreds of spectators.

Xu Shouqiang originally hoped to win both the 400-meter freestyle and the 100-meter backstroke, but due to participating in too many events, he lacked the strength and narrowly missed out on both, which was also a pity. In the final water polo exhibition match, the black and white teams fought fiercely, with the black team being slightly better and winning 6-4. The results of the seven men's finals are recorded below:

Event First Place Second Place Third Place Fourth Place Time

50-meter Freestyle Burt Xu Heng Griffiths Wu Hua 28.3 seconds

100-meter Freestyle Burt Qi Xin Wang Hongsheng Ding Tongru 1 minute 9.8 seconds

400-meter Freestyle Parkerding Xu Shouqiang Chen Yuquan Zeng Dehui 6 minutes 55 seconds

1500-meter Freestyle Xu Shouqiang Wu Dingjian Lin Qi Wu Zifang 28 minutes 13.4 seconds

100-meter Backstroke Sterling Xu Shouqiang Sun Guang'er Chen Yuntai 1 minute 16 seconds

200-meter Breaststroke Zhang Jia Sun Guangyi Zhong Shoujun Zhu Genbao 3 minutes 16.9 seconds

150-meter Individual Medley Zhuo Zongyi Wu Dingjian Zhong Shoujun Wu Hua 2 minutes 29.7 seconds

### Poolside Anecdotes

Yesterday, the audience reached five or six hundred people, half of whom were spectators and tourists, so the poolside was full of bathers. Before the competition, the announcer tried his best to shout and get the "spectators" out of the pool. At around 5:00 PM, just as the last person in the 200-meter breaststroke reached the finish line, splashes could be heard, and the audience on all sides entered the pool. The audience, who had admired swimming skills for three hours, were eager to try it themselves.

During the 50-meter freestyle preliminary, Qiu Yunguang repeatedly false started due to excessive nervousness. Burt happened to be next to him, and was greatly affected, following him into the pool twice. After Qiu Yunguang was disqualified, Burt was very panicked. When the starting gun went off, Burt remained frozen, and only dared to enter the pool after all the other competitors had already started. However, he still easily qualified for the final.

The giant of the Chinese Youth team, Xu Shouqiang, participated in three events: the 1500-meter and 400-meter freestyle, and the 100-meter backstroke. He was busy with registration, drawing lots, competing, and receiving awards.

The daughter of Director Li of the Education Bureau, Ms. Yuehua, is familiar with Zhejiang swimming and attends and presents awards at every competition. Yesterday, after arriving at the pool, she asked the ticket collector to pay attention to anyone entering the venue with a certain ticket number, and detain them and send them to the police for investigation. It turned out that after Ms. Li attended the Liangjiang Open Competition the day before, her purse was snatched by a cyclist near Tongren Road. The purse contained several complimentary tickets for yesterday's competition. Ms. Li hoped to use this clue to catch the thief, but the thief did not take the bait.

Someone discovered that all the top four medals for yesterday's competition were the same as those awarded in the Hongkou Swimming Competition. The organizers explained that they were leftover materials from the previous competition. (Quan Quan)

### I Want to Be a Teacher

— Yi Jun

I have been an elementary school teacher for one and a half years, a middle school teacher for half a year, a public school teacher for one year, and a tutor for several months. I studied education in university. In my fourth year, I served as a teacher at the public school run by the university. All day long, I would talk about educational theories and boast about education, so my classmates called me "Poor Professor." I felt very comfortable and proud to receive this title.

This summer, I graduated from university. In order to find a middle school teaching position, I ran around and took many routes, twenty or thirty, but the answers I received were very satisfactory, such as "I will definitely do my best to help," "I will let you know if there is an opportunity," and "I think it will be no problem." But until today, I still haven't found a middle school teaching position. This is not only beyond my own expectations, but many classmates are also surprised: "How come even you can't do it?"

To be honest, I am usually not a very helpless person among my classmates. The reason why I am so unexpectedly unsuccessful now is partly because I was a little careless, often feeling like I was not sure, and not very anxious; and partly because I am a little thin-skinned and not suitable for ingratiating myself. When I go to ask someone for a job, I always feel embarrassed, so after looking for him once or twice, I don't go to him anymore, unlike those who like to ingratiate themselves and go to the person they are asking every day, seizing the opportunity when it comes.

But I am not truly unemployed now. I am currently serving in an organization affiliated with the Ministry of National Defense (you could say I am an official), and the salary is no less than that of a poor teacher. And I can ride public buses and trams for free or at a reduced fare, but I am not satisfied. I still want to be a poor teacher. I have studied education for four years, read hundreds of books on education, written a lot of chalk characters, and come into contact with thousands of young people and children. Now that I have to break away from these people, things, and matters, I am unwilling no matter what.

One classmate advised me: "Why don't you just keep doing your current job? Why do you have to be a teacher? If you become a teacher, you'll be a teacher for life. What kind of development is that!" I don't agree with his well-intentioned advice at all. Is it that there is no development in being a teacher for life? Do you have to rise through the ranks to be considered development? You should know that a teacher who teaches better this year than last year is developing; a teacher who is more popular with students this year than last year is developing; a teacher who improves their own morality and knowledge is developing; a society where the atmosphere improves is developing; a nation where the character improves is developing; how can you say there is no development in all of this? To use a term from education: education is growth, education is development.

Therefore, being a teacher for life, taking education as a lifelong career, is not only not an unambitious thing, but a sacred, great, and noble undertaking!

Based on this understanding, I am determined to be a teacher for life.

If Shanghai has no place for me, then "the best of the thirty-six stratagems is to leave," and I plan to go to Taiwan.

### Old Mountain Villa

— Qian Dacheng

The Zhao family of Old Mountain Villa are a great book-collecting family from Yushan. The villa is located in Bao Ci Li (now called Bao Ci Bridge, at the foot of the northern Yushan mountain). It was formerly the other residence of Wu Wenke, Duke Ne of the Ming Dynasty. It occupies several acres of land and is famed for its white pine and red bean trees. Later, a plum garden of dozens of acres was added, but it is now abandoned. The Zhao family's ancestors moved from Jiangyin to Changshu. A man named Kui Chang, courtesy name Manhua, first managed the gardens and named them "Half Acre Garden." His son, Zongjian, courtesy name Cihou, also known as Cigon, protected the local area with a militia during the Red Sheep Rebellion. He was a close friend of Grand Tutor Gong Weng, Uncle Ping. He enjoyed entertaining guests, was fond of drinking, and possessed a rich collection of bronze and stone inscriptions, illustrations, and historical books. Xu Kang lived in his house for a long time, and Kang's "Before the Dreams End" was written in this villa. After Cigong passed away, the Grand Tutor wrote an epitaph for his tomb, saying: "Others are busy, but I am free, my heart holds armor and my will is stern." From this, his interests and ambitions can be seen. Cigong's son, Zhongju, was skilled in poetry and painting and also enjoyed collecting books. When Ye Jushang visited Yushan, he often went to see his rare books. When Jushang wrote "Poems on Book Collecting," he called him a small book collector, perhaps because he had not seen even a tenth of his collection.

Cigong's great-grandson, Bu Qi, courtesy name Junqian, also known as Guchun, was proud of his talent and fond of wine, not bound by convention. As a child, he was fond of playing and joking with other children. He once used a red gold landscape fan by Cheng Mengyang as armor, and in a moment, he would make butterfly pieces to dance with. He also once exchanged a fragment of a Song Dynasty handwritten copy of the "Veritable Records of Emperor Taizong of Song" for a cricket from a woodcutter. Eventually, it was passed on to Shanghai. Most of the books in this villa were later acquired by the local resident, Ding Chuwuo. One of them was dozens of volumes of Yuan Dynasty Zaju dramas, originally collected in the garden, which were also owned by Chuwuo, who kept them secret. It was not until the Dingchou Rebellion that they were dispersed and became widely known. Sun Kaidi wrote a long article of 200,000 words to praise them. The name of the Old Mountain Villa became known far and wide. However, Kaidi did not provide detailed information about the Zhao family's genealogy, and he did not fully understand the history of the book's circulation. I plan to write another article to describe it in detail.

Junqian loved learning in his adulthood, and was adept in poetry and art, also understanding epigraphy. He deeply regretted his childish fondness for mischief and became cautious in making friends, having the closest relationship with Mr. Yang Wuyang. During the Dingchou Rebellion, he encountered Japanese pirates, fought bravely, and died. He was not yet forty years old. After Junqian's death, his family declined further. The year before last, I visited this villa with Mr. Wuyang. Fortunately, the white pine and red bean trees were still intact. His family's livelihood was becoming increasingly difficult, and they hinted at the intention to sell the villa. Even the grass and trees of Pingquan cannot be permanently preserved. The Zhao family has owned this villa for several generations, and it is a great fortune to have such a high reputation in the country! How can a famous person be found to continue to own this villa and maintain its elegance and culture?

### Recent Works by Xia An

— Ye Gongchuo

Feeling moved by the disaster of the times, I composed this poem:

Gold and swords destroy demons,
Overthrowing all living beings into the net.
Bitter change turns noble wine into poison,
Who can save the moths from the red flames?
The Nine Hells forever mourn flowers like the sea,
A myriad of eons know the moon is not a wave.
Disaster fills the land, the people are sick,
The disease of Vimalakirti startles all demons.

Written for Lu Xiaodan on Zhang Daqian's Painting of Entering Sichuan

Five Ding opened the road like Can Cong,
The mountain passes of Qin are in his palm;
Today, the rivers and mountains are returned to his control,
Opening the mountains still seems like a success.

Daqian's brush is ingenious and spiritual,
Modeling mountains and rivers, he has learned from the masters;
Alas, I am old and cannot enter Sichuan,
I cannot add to Du Fu's poems.

### Visiting Sage Jiang on Confucius' Birthday

— Chen Yixian

In recent years, the Peking Opera world has produced a sage and a virtuous man. The virtuous man is Yu Shuyan, known as Great Virtuous Yu. Miaoxiang is kind and approachable, with the best relations, and is known as a beautiful sage. In "Silang Visits His Mother", the Yang Zongbao he plays has eight lines of lyrics, known as Jiang's tune, unmatched in the north and south. Today is Confucius' birthday, and all government agencies are on holiday. In the afternoon, a friend came to my residence to talk about opera. We happened to mention Miaoxiang, and I said that his new residence is on Dagu Road, not far from here, so we went to visit him together. Upon entering the door, his wife came out to greet us first and said, "Sixth Master (Miaoxiang is the sixth child) will go to Xujiahui Xinhua Factory tonight to film "Life and Death Hate", and he may have to work all night. He is resting now to conserve his energy and will come out in a while." About ten minutes later, Miaoxiang came out and exchanged casual greetings. I saw a new photo on the wall. Miaoxiang was standing in the middle in Chinese costume, with Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang on his left and right, wearing Western suits. I asked when it was taken. Miaoxiang said, "This picture was taken recently. Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou both belong to the horse zodiac, and I belong to the tiger, so they wanted me to stand in the middle."

Talking about the death of Jin Shaoshan, Miaoxiang said, "After Shaoshan passed away, reports said that he was destitute. Tan Fuying and others in Beiping sang charity performances to help him. Before Tang Yunsheng came on stage at Tianchan, Huang Guaqiu and others sang a "Red Mane Horse", and the proceeds from the tickets, after deducting expenses, were all sent to Beiping to Shaoshan's family. Recently, someone came from Beiping and said that although Shaoshan had no cash after his death, his collection of snuff bottles was worth many millions, and he also had smoking pipes that were worth many millions, but they were all 'cold goods' and difficult to sell at a good price."

My friend praised his performance in "The Gathering of Heroes," and Miaoxiang said, "Xu Xiaoxiang was the best in 'The Gathering of Heroes.' Xiaoxiang returned to Suzhou at about fifty years old, and no one dared to sing this opera. One day, the big boss (Cheng Changgeng) encouraged Wang Lengxian (Guiguan) to try singing it, and everyone praised it. An old amateur opera fan, Master Sun (Chunshan), said, 'This is just ash.' I didn't catch up with Xu Xiaoxiang and can only learn from Wang Lengxian. You praise my 'Gathering of Heroes,' but Wang Lengxian sang it so well that some people still ridiculed it as ash. Compared to Xu Xiaoxiang, I can only be considered dirt under his feet." The above passage is truly the height of artful expression.

When we were saying goodbye, Miaoxiang said that he would warm up his voice. So his son played the erhu, and Miaoxiang sang a long passage from "Flying Tiger Mountain," truly satisfying his love for opera. Today is Confucius' birthday, and it is worth recording that I heard Sage Jiang warm up his voice. (Night under the lamp, 27th)

### Black Blood and White Blood

— Qing

In 1868, the US state of Louisiana was holding gubernatorial elections. Candidate Henry Clay Warmoth, in an effort to win the votes of black people, gave a very wonderful speech—he said: if he were elected, he would invent a machine to extract the black blood from black people and then inject white blood, so that all black people would become white people.

### Eastern Scales and Western Claws

— Cang Yu

The world's fastest steam locomotive has appeared in New York State. It is said that this locomotive's speed can exceed 140 miles per hour, faster than the United States' streamlined Diegel engine-powered train M-10001.

Movies have conquered everyone. As a result, in today's world, there are as many as 86,640 movie theaters. By continent, Europe has the most, with 51,227 theaters. By country, the United States has the most, with 18,765 theaters. Second place is the Soviet Union, with approximately 17,500 theaters.

The world's most peculiar set of stamps was the commemorative stamps issued in 1905 for the 300th anniversary of the author of Don Quixote, Cervantes. The set of stamps consisted of ten stamps, each with an important illustration from Don Quixote.

### American Doctors' Dirty Secrets

— Chen Xiang

In the past twenty years, American medical technology has made rapid progress, but one dirty secret of the medical world that has been passed down for many years has not been stopped. This dirty secret is "fee-splitting"—the secret division of surgical fees paid by patients between internists and surgeons.

The most common form of fee-splitting is this: Dr. A, a general internist and surgeon, says to his patient: "I'm afraid this is appendicitis. I will ask Dr. B to take care of you. I introduce all my surgical patients to him. He is the best surgeon I know." Dr. B performed the surgery on the patient, and it went well.

Dr. A charges the patient a consultation fee of five or ten dollars, while Dr. B charges the patient a huge surgical fee—for example, one hundred and fifty dollars. When Dr. B receives the money, he divides seventy-five dollars to Dr. A.

Sometimes, the internist charges the patient the full fee and then splits it with the surgeon.

Sometimes fee-splitting is disguised under some pretext. The most common is that the surgeon uses the excuse of asking an internist to assist during the surgery, while the latter's actual work may be limited to holding a retractor or an anesthetic mask—this is fundamentally a "showing off" job. Sometimes, in order to thank the internist for referring business, the surgeon asks the patient to have their blood pressure checked at the internist's office several times after the surgery—charging twenty-five to fifty dollars each time!

Fifteen states in the United States consider fee-splitting between doctors illegal, and violators are subject to fines, imprisonment, or license revocation. However, even if law enforcement officials know that a doctor has violated this law, it is difficult to prosecute them because evidence of such illegal behavior is not easy to obtain.

### A Record of Miss Lü Bicheng

— Lu Danlin

"To become the top scholar in women's studies is also sad,
My lifelong achievements are buried again;
After hastily speaking the Dharma and discussing the scriptures,
I have only returned to the human world this once!"

This is the final poem by Ms. Lü Bicheng of Jingde at her deathbed in Hong Kong on January 24, 1943. Looking at this poem, it seems that she understood the principle of death and had no worries at all.

At that time, Hong Kong was in a period of occupation, and the country was also in the midst of the War of Resistance. News was blocked. Therefore, even a few years after her death, people still often inquired about her whereabouts.

When she was twelve years old, her father (Ruitian) passed away. On one occasion, her mother, Madam Yan, was kidnapped by bandits. She immediately wrote a letter to her uncle, Fan Yunmen, requesting assistance. At that time, Fan was the Jiangsu Provincial Administration Commissioner and arranged for rescue, and she was safely released.

When Yuan Shikai was the Governor-General of Zhili, he allocated public funds to send her to prepare for the establishment of the Tianjin Beiyang Women's Public School, first as the chief teacher and then promoted to supervisor (now known as the principal). At that time, she was only twenty-one years old, which was eight years before the Republic of China. Before she ran the school, she once served as a writer for the Ta Kung Pao. Qiu Jin admired her very much. Later, Qiu Jin published the "Chinese Women's News," and the inaugural speech was written by her.

She liked to travel and went to Europe and America twice. She had been to the United States, France, England, Italy, Switzerland, and other countries, especially staying in Geneva for the longest time. In the United States, she studied art at Columbia University. In Europe, she initiated a movement to protect life and abstain from killing with philanthropists from various countries, and at the same time translated Buddhist scriptures into English to spread Buddhism. She practiced vegetarianism and abstained from killing for her belief in Buddhism. Because of this, she bought a house in Hong Kong in 1935 and moved in. Not long after, she discovered that the pillars were infested with termites. If she eliminated them, it would go against the principle of not killing; otherwise, the termites would rot the pillars, the house would collapse, and people would suffer. She had no choice but to let the house go to others at a low price.

She wrote many works in her life. In addition to Chinese and Western essays, her collections of ci poems were printed several times, such as "Xin Fang Ci" and "Xiao Zhu Ci." In her preface, she explained the reasons for setting the drafts and printing them, saying, "I sigh at the difficulties of the world and the strange dramas of the family. All writings should be finalized in one's lifetime and printed at any time, so as to avoid being forgotten after death." From these words, we can know the purpose of her self-edited and printed ci poem collection. Her ci poems were most highly praised by Fan Yunmen. When "Xin Fang Ci" was printed, Fan commented on each poem, such as: "The legacy of the two masters of the Southern Tang," "Looser than Mei Xi, more delicate than Long Zhou," "Chen Junheng could not reach," "Jiaxuan's treasure hairpin and Fen Tao Ye Ferry cannot monopolize the beauty in front," "Clear, profound, and ancient, no less than Fan Xie Mountain House," "This ci is indeed from the Northern Song Dynasty," etc. From these, we can see the depth of her attainments and achievements in ci poetry.

She experienced many hardships and remained single to the end. In her life, she lived a luxurious life in terms of food and clothing. Later, she was enlightened and devoted herself to studying the inner scriptures and spreading Buddhism until the end of her life. All that remains are her poems and ci poems, a generation of talented women who died in a chaotic world, lonely and unheard of, which cannot help but make people feel sentimental! No wonder her last poem had the sad sound of "I have only returned to the human world this once."
