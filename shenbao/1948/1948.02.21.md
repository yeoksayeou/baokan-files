### Ma Qing Testifies in the House of Representatives Hearing, Requesting Congress to Allocate Funds to Aid China to Establish a Stable Economic Situation

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 20th (Radio Dispatch), Washington: Secretary of State Marshall attended a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 20th, requesting that Congress allocate $570 million in aid to China so that the country could have "time to breathe" to take steps to stabilize its economic situation. However, Secretary Marshall stated, "The United States cannot, therefore, assume direct responsibility for the work of the Chinese government and its political, economic, and military affairs. Regarding the aid-to-China plan, it should be recognized that the main solution to China's problems depends largely on the Chinese themselves." He pointed out that the main factor hindering the resolution of China's economic problems was the civil war, and further stated, "The civil war has depleted China's foreign exchange reserves at home and abroad, continuously destroyed property and economic life, and hindered recovery. The Communist army has caused terrible damage to disrupt China's economy, as it is the Communist Party's intention to force China's economy to collapse." He stated: China's current situation makes an effective long-term economic recovery plan impossible. However, Secretary Marshall also stated: The United States should provide aid to China to help delay the rapid decline of the Chinese economy, so that China can have time to breathe, and then begin to establish a more stable economic situation. The United States cannot currently consider providing China with similar assistance to the European recovery plan. For example, in terms of providing a currency stabilization fund, according to the opinions of currency experts, the amount required is very large, and under China's current situation, most of the results will be lost. He stated: Before the establishment of a foreign aid organization, the State Department will temporarily be responsible for the work. Secretary Marshall did not mention military aid to China, which is expected to arouse opposition from the Republican Party. After Secretary Marshall presented his views, Chairman Eaton of the committee immediately expressed his opinion, making an analogy to the government's proposed aid-to-China plan, believing that "the gun muzzle is too large, and the bullet is too small."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th (United Press Dispatch)] Congressman Zhou Yide, who is leading the congressional initiative to aid China, recently stated: The government's $570 million aid-to-China plan is fundamentally flawed in terms of military affairs. He advocated providing Chairman Chiang with military aid of the same nature as aid to Greece. He stated: Unless China can win its war against the Communists, I do not believe that this economic plan can have any effect. Only by winning the war against the Communists can the economic depletion and chaos caused by the war in China be contained. Zhou did not want to express his views on the amount of money, but stated: I have always stated that assisting China in the following matters is necessary: (1) Moral support. The President's aid-to-China proposal has already achieved this. (2) Military assistance, including arms and ammunition, and authorizing our military advisory group in China to provide more assistance to China in all aspects, just as the military delegation stationed in Greece did. (3) Financial assistance, so that China can make up for its balance of payments deficit. This only requires lending $20 million per month. (4) Assist in stabilizing its currency, preferably by providing 150 to 200 million US dollars in silver. (5) Invest in special projects, such as railways, shipping, power plants, textile factories, and fertilizer plants. Once China's military situation stabilizes, private investment will flow into China.

### Stabilizing Our Foreign Exchange Market, Bei Zuyi Will Submit a Plan to the United States

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Well-informed sources reported on the 19th that Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese economic and technical mission here, hopes to submit to the United States government in the next few days a plan drafted by China to use American aid to stabilize the foreign exchange market in Shanghai. The sources said: Being able to adopt this special way of handling the problem, Nanjing has announced that it will request three to five hundred million yuan from the United States to achieve some kind of stability. The plan to be submitted by Bei requires the United States to fund the Shanghai Chinese government foreign exchange stabilization committee with a maximum amount of 500 million yuan. The committee will control all foreign exchange transactions. The Chinese reason is that if the foreign exchange committee has this amount of money, it will be able to maintain the exchange rate on a regular basis. Financial experts believe that if the Chinese government can maintain the exchange rate on a regular basis, the efficiency of its necessary plans will be greatly enhanced. Some experts believe that part of the 500 million yuan fund may be used to increase the purchase of goods stipulated in the 570 million US aid-to-China plan. It is pointed out that 510 million yuan in the aid-to-China plan is earmarked for "import of essential goods," which is exactly the latest figure for China during the validity period of the aid-to-China plan. It is generally believed that if more funds can be raised for this purpose, some shortages can be alleviated. The reason is that balancing foreign exchange enables the government to have greater control over import efficiency. At the same time, supplementing the import of essential goods exceeding the plan may establish a basis for stabilizing the domestic goods situation in China. It is generally believed that this is a prerequisite for reforming the currency system. In the past few weeks, Bei Zuyi has explained the contents of Zhang Qun's ten-point financial and economic improvement plan to American officials "item by item." As of today, Bei has explained seven of them in detail, but the fifth point is uniquely absent. According to that point, it is related to "establishing a basis for a stable currency system." What Bei plans to submit in the short term is the "clarification" of the fifth point. It is expected that its content will include a plan to stabilize the foreign exchange market, and it may also be a strategy with other indirect solutions to the currency problem. Chinese officials have made it clear that they are not currently interested in reforming the currency system with a silver standard.

### This Year's Loan Plan, The Four Joint Council Will Discuss and Decide Today

[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Four Joint Council will hold its first meeting of this year at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th. The meeting will be presided over by Zhang Qun, vice chairman of the council. All directors and persons in charge of the four banks, two bureaus and one treasury will participate. This year's loan plan can be discussed and decided at the meeting, but it can only be implemented after Chairman Chiang's final approval. It has been decided that agricultural loans will be opened first, but the date of opening has not yet been determined. Because the suspension of loans was Chairman Chiang's handwritten order, the date of opening will also wait for the Chairman to decide. The loan plan formulated by the Four Joint Headquarters is still divided into two parts: agricultural loans and industrial and mining loans. Each has its own annual guidelines and plans, but the amount of industrial and mining loans has not been pre-determined. As of the 20th, all of the plans for this year's loans from the four banks, two bureaus and one treasury have been sent to the Four Joint Headquarters. The Ministry of Economic Affairs had previously submitted three opinions to the Executive Yuan on opening up loans, advocating that loans should be opened before the Spring Festival, but it was not adopted. This time, the Four Joint Council will hold a meeting, and Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian specially ordered the Industrial Department to draft opinions on industrial loans, which were drafted by Gu Baochang, director of the department, and presented to Chen on the evening of the 19th. These opinions will also be presented at the Four Joint Council meeting on the 21st. It is said that the main idea is to advocate that industrial loans should be restored as soon as possible to promote production. Regarding the loan method, it is advocated that it should be different depending on the industry, and there is no need to fix a certain method. Moreover, the area where industrial loans are handled should be treated equally throughout the country, and should not be biased towards a certain region. It is also advocated that there should be an overall plan.

President Truman's proposal to aid China is indeed exciting news.

### Foreign and Overseas Chinese Investors Flock to Invest in Guangdong

[Report from this Newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th] According to the person in charge of the Engineering Guidance Office in Guangzhou: As southern China is becoming increasingly prosperous, foreign and overseas Chinese investors are very interested in investing and setting up factories in Guangdong.

### Grain Rationing System in Five Cities, Implemented in Beijing and Shanghai Starting Next Month, Guangzhou Starting on March 15, and Pingjin Starting on April 1

[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The meeting on grain rationing in five cities was very successful, and the mayors of the five cities were able to take advantage of the meeting to discuss various requests with the relevant departments. Among them, the greatest achievements were made by the cities of Pingjin, because the grain sources required by the cities of Pingjin in the rationing system have been negotiated with the Ministry of Food, and at the same time, the Ministry of Food has approved that in the four months of implementing the rationing in the future, the Ministry of Food will still transport 500,000 bags of flour and 30,000 dans of rice to the north every month according to the past practice of allocation, in order to adjust the grain market in Pingjin and further revitalize the demand for people's food in North China. In addition, the amount of grain rationed in the five cities, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Food, is one dou per person in each city, and two dou in Shanghai. One dou of which is rice that can be purchased at the market price with a purchase certificate, the purpose of which is to restrict and prevent grain merchants from hoarding, and at the same time to control market fluctuations, which has nothing to do with rationing. As for the fact that other cities have not handled it at the same time, it is because the localities do not have this need. The spokesman also told reporters in a very optimistic tone that the grain sources for rationing, whether in Pingjin or Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, have been fully prepared and are not in short supply. As for the representatives who have not yet left Beijing, they are negotiating some related issues, such as transportation and funds for purchasing grain. Once the Ministry of Finance has approved the allocation of funds, they can return to their posts and actively prepare for rationing. In addition, the implementation period of the rationing system in the five cities is slightly different. The exact dates are as follows: Beijing and Shanghai will start on March 1, Guangzhou will start on March 15, and Pingjin will start on April 1. In addition, the general rules for food rationing in the five cities discussed and passed by the rationing meeting will be announced and implemented after approval.

### The Inside Story of the Communist Bandits in the Northeast

Various Institutions Adopt a Decentralized Approach

[United Press, this city] A person who is absolutely reliable lived behind the iron curtain in the Northeast for a year and a half and has now returned to Shanghai. He informed us of the situation in the Northeast as follows: The CCP learned a lesson from the Battle of Yan'an and realized the harm of concentrating administrative institutions. Therefore, it adopted a decentralized approach in the Northeast. Its active bases are currently distributed in an arc shape, from Harbin to the east and north, directly pointing to the Soviet border. The CCP concentrated its political headquarters in Jiayuli. The main artillery training center of the Communist Party is in Mudanjiang, 85 miles east of the Soviet Union and only 175 miles from Vladivostok. The Air Force school is located in Linkou, and the Soviet border is 50 miles to the north. (Continued on page 2, column 3)

### British Embassy Statement: No Evacuation Notice Issued

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The British Embassy has denied rumors that it had issued an evacuation order for British nationals north of the Yangtze River.

The British Embassy's concern is solely to prevent British nationals from encountering difficulties as a result of possible unfortunate developments and traffic disruptions.

First Train Local Cadres

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 20th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters plans to thoroughly train the populace within six months to provide a foundation for military operations.

They will gather in Tangshan on the 21st, only 79 days after leaving Tomsk, which is located south of the Soviet border.

### Anshan City Engulfed in Flames: National Army Fights Bitterly, Making Bandits Pay the Price for Every Bunker; Our Country's Heavy Industry Unfortunately Destroyed

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] Heavy snow fell on the 20th, hindering air force operations. According to military authorities, the Anshan garrison held the Tiexi Steel Plant on the 19th, killing many bandits. Contact with them was lost that night. The number of bandits attacking Anshan reached 50,000 to 60,000, and the garrison, with a force several times smaller, held out heroically for a week. The North Shahe Railway Bridge in Anshan and another two strongholds are being defended by the National Army. Furthermore, bandits who had gathered in the Kaiyuan area north of Shenyang reportedly ambushed National Army troops who were being transferred, but were repelled by the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] Fierce street fighting has broken out in Anshan City. By the afternoon of the 19th, the entire city was engulfed in flames under a barrage of artillery fire. The Communist bandits launched repeated fierce attacks, and the National Army defended their strongholds, forcing the Communist bandits to pay a heavy price for every bunker. The fighting was particularly intense on both the east and west sides of the train station and in the city center. The National Army is still holding the Steel Company, continuing to inflict heavy casualties on the bandits. [Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant was one of the most successful in the Northeast in terms of post-war recovery and is a key component of China's heavy industry. If it unfortunately falls into the hands of the bandits, it will inevitably be destroyed beforehand, and the loss will be difficult to quantify. The world will lament this. The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant is the second largest in East Asia, second only to the Yawata Iron Works in Japan, with an annual production capacity of 800,000 tons of steel and 1.5 million tons of pig iron. It is known as the "Iron Capital." It was taken over in June 1946, and the iron and steel plant and its affiliated units were gradually established in October of the same year. Steel production began in mid-January 1947. The budget for the resumption of work required US$10 million, with an annual value of US$30 million. The National Resources Commission decided to prioritize the revival of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in its heavy industry development plans, supplying hardware and equipment to North and Central China, saving more than US$100 million in foreign exchange each year. The first phase of the plant's restoration plan called for an annual output of 200,000 tons, reaching one million tons in five years. The first phase of steelmaking involved the restoration of one 600-ton mixer, two 300-ton refining furnaces, four 100-ton furnaces, and eight gas furnaces. Under the guidance of Shao Yizhou, the plant was painstakingly managed. The steelmaking furnace was put into operation on August 6th of last year. More than 30 factories, including coking, steelmaking, steel rolling, casting, steel pipe, steel rope, rail, and bridge factories, were successively put into operation, flourishing and growing. Until the time of this writing, steel ingot production had increased to more than 1,600 tons. Unfortunately, the conflict resumed in October, transportation was interrupted, and work came to a standstill, resulting in the failure of ironmaking efforts. According to regulations, the iron and steel plant's resumption process involved first producing rolled products, then flat steel, and then pig iron, using semi-finished products (such as steel ingots and large and small steel billets) stored in the factory to maintain production during the transition period. Last year, 70,000 tons of rolled products were produced, with about 10,000 tons being exported, including small steel products, steel sheets, wires, and medium-sized steel plates and tubes.

Editorial

### Several Issues Concerning Rationing

When the Sino-American Relief Agreement was signed and announced by the governments of the two countries on October 27th of last year, this newspaper published an article advocating the implementation of comprehensive rationing in this city, with the grain item allocated for rationing materials and half of the cost borne by our country to match the contribution. Now, the central government has decided to implement rationing simultaneously in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, which is generally consistent with our proposal. The grain rationing conference convened by the Ministry of Food has also been held in Nanjing in recent days, and decisions have been made regarding all rationing plans. The "General Rules for the Implementation of Grain Rationing in the Five Cities" that were passed will also be implemented. This is a very important matter. We would like to raise several issues regarding the method for the reference of the competent authorities.

(1) How to Prepare: The central competent departments and the five major cities have all made considerable plans in advance. This city has a solid foundation, and both the outline of the rationing and the detailed rules for implementation have been drafted separately before being submitted to the central government for discussion. We believe that the outcome of the grain rationing conference will be quite comprehensive. However, comprehensive rationing is still a first for our country, and the technology is very complex. In order to ensure the accuracy of time, quantity, and price, all issues related to sources, transportation, storage, distribution, investigation, certification, and consignment sales must be carefully arranged and coordinated. Therefore, the preparations must be sufficient, and the allocation of agencies, funds, and personnel must be complete. It cannot be too hasty due to time constraints, nor can it be too simple for the sake of saving money. The past administrative practices of rushing things through and simplifying things in order to save money are not suitable for rationing. This is a scientific work that affects the interests of every citizen, especially in terms of international perception. What is the efficiency of our administration? This requires a factual answer. What is the key?

(2) How to Cooperate: Even if the method is very thorough, it will be useless if it is not implemented effectively or if the people do not abide by the law. Based on what has been shown by various facts in the past, we hope that: (1) The investigation must be accurate, and the verification must be strict, and all abuses such as duplication, accommodation, and fraud must be eliminated; (2) Therefore, in terms of citizens, the movement of household registration and the application for national identity cards also require the greatest attention. Although the household registration has been checked, the household registration may not be very clear, especially in the case of identity cards; not everyone may have them. This cannot be entirely blamed on the autonomous organizations, because citizens may be too negligent about such procedures.

(3) How to Prevent Abuses: The so-called abuses, in addition to the duplication and fraud mentioned above, also include the following that we have heard of: (1) Not being able to receive ration coupons; (2) Requiring fulfillment of certain conditions when receiving coupons; (3) Not being able to buy goods even after receiving coupons; (4) Goods being too bad; (5) Insufficient quantity; (6) In certain areas, we have heard that the rationing amount is distributed separately, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the government's prescribed rationing amount for each person; (7) Selling the rationed goods at market prices and using the profits (price difference) for public use, without prior permission from the authorities; (8) The handling agency may even have a portion of the remaining ration coupons that can be distributed monthly, as if distributing bonuses. These abuses are certainly not universal, but they are not non-existent either. Articles 17 to 20 of the detailed rules for implementation drafted by this city this time have expressly prohibited the above items 1 to 5, and it has not been touched upon how to prevent items 6, 7, and 8. Measures should be supplemented and strictly prohibited to improve the credibility of the rationing policy and increase the trust of citizens.

(4) How to Determine Price and Quantity: Rationing has three conditions, namely, fixed time, fixed quantity, and fixed price. Without these, it is not enough to achieve the goal of stabilizing grain prices and stabilizing society. Regarding the price, how it will be determined has not been announced as of this writing. According to the capital's forecast, it is planned to be 5% lower than the market price, which does not seem to meet general expectations. Because in the past, the rationing price in this city was only 240,000 yuan per dan, and it will be adjusted from this month, but it will not exceed 800,000 yuan per dan. If it is sold at the price set by the ministry, the difference would be too great. Moreover, adjusting it monthly is tantamount to following the black market, which is inconsistent with the purpose of suppressing rice prices. Food Minister Yu said in a firm tone: "I believe that grain prices can be suppressed to a considerable extent after the implementation of the rationing system." (See this newspaper on the 16th) We believe that the rationing, which is 5% lower than the market price, is not welcomed by the general public.

As for the quantity, it is planned that small households will receive one dou per month for complete rationing, and large households will receive two dou, half of which will be rationed and half of which will be purchased, called rationed rice and permitted rice. This is indeed a last resort before the source of grain is smooth and this material cannot be fully grasped. Moreover, if this is done, rice merchants can still operate, which will not lead to serious problems such as unemployment, and it can be said that both sides are taken care of. What can be studied is that each person's permitted rice must also be purchased with a certificate, and it is not allowed to exceed the limit. Although this is said to prevent hoarding, but the government has not been able to fully supply the people with rice, and the rationing period is currently only tentatively set for four months, and it has not been confirmed whether it can be extended. Whether this restriction is necessary seems to be a question. Because individual households' storage of rice for personal use is different from large-scale hoarding, and the provision of the right to purchase rice can also slightly reduce the government's burden. For example, large companies and factories often have their own reserves of rice for their employees, so there is no difficulty in whether the rationed rice is sufficient or whether there is a delay. In our view, if the government must strictly implement this restriction, then the extension of the rationing period and the expansion of the rationing amount (that is, the two dou of rice per month for large households must be fully rationed) must be continuously worked hard and promoted to achieve it as soon as possible. As the ancients said, "If you have a plan, do not abandon it." Since it has been done, we always hope to continue to do it. It must not be done suddenly and then stopped suddenly, so as not to lose the government's prestige. We especially hope to find ways to expand it, and truly do it in a good way, so that citizens can truly trust the supply of food and other daily necessities, and there is no need to save separately, then the trend of individual households hoarding will naturally stop, and prices can be stabilized to satisfaction.

It is rumored that the current rationing period is temporarily set at four months, that is, assuming from March to the end of June of this year. The reason for this is of course that the number of food items under the US relief program is limited and does not allow for long-term rationing. However, as far as we know, there is no way to supplement them in the future. For example: (1) The proceeds from the sale of US materials can still be used to purchase food, according to Article 3, Paragraph C of the Sino-American Agreement. (2) The loan of US$180 million approved by the US Congress last year will also be provided in the form of material assistance. These are all plans from foreign aid. If the rationing price is set at 5% lower than the market price, then the loss is minimal, and it is not difficult to find a way to subsidize the rice.

In short, the main point of this grain rationing conference is grain, but its impact affects the entire rationing issue. Because grain is the center of rationing, if grain is rationed well, the supply of other daily necessities such as oil, salt, sugar, cloth, and fuel will also be handled well. Therefore, this conference is of great importance. In addition to the above-mentioned issues, we also hope that it will broaden its scope and send personnel from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Resources Commission to participate, so that there will also be opportunities to improve the rationing of other daily necessities. Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, "US Aid and Self-Help," contained the sentence "President Truman proposed to allocate US$570 million to aid China within eight years." "Eight years" is a mistake for "one year." This is hereby corrected.

### Is the Japanese Emperor Responsible for War Crimes? Our Side Pays Close Attention; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Does Not Comment

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 20th] After the news that the Tokyo Far East International Military Tribunal's Prosecutor's Office issued a general indictment against Japanese war criminals stating that the Japanese Emperor was not responsible for war crimes reached the capital, people from all walks of life paid close attention. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it had not received an official report from our officials stationed in Japan and declined to comment. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, was our ambassador to Japan before the war. After analyzing the truth and background of this issue to our newspaper reporter, he temporarily reserved his personal opinions, but emphasized that in any case, in order to ensure that Japan does not engage in aggression again, supervision must be strict. Wang Chonghui, a legal scholar and government official, also believed that the control work after the signing of the peace treaty should not be ignored. However, he believed that the issue of whether the Japanese Emperor was responsible for war crimes and his abolition was not very important. Retaining the Emperor could prevent political and social turmoil in Japan and allow him to be responsible for the implementation of the peace treaty clauses. To prevent Japan from rising again and engaging in aggression, he believed that it could be done by completely disarming its military, re-educating its people's thinking, and establishing a democratic foundation. Wang Zhengting, a diplomat, believed that the inner cause of the Far East International Tribunal's Prosecutor's Office's decision was the political influence on the judiciary. Wang cited the example of Empress Dowager Cixi not being held responsible for war crimes after the Eight-Nation Alliance in the Gengzi Year, saying that this could avoid confusion caused by Japanese superstitious feelings, but if the law were to be investigated, it should be treated separately. A judicial scholar who did not want to be named said that throughout the entire course of Japanese aggression, the Japanese Emperor had personally participated in decision-making and had come out to lead. The measures of the Tokyo International Tribunal were not well considered. Another well-known international legal scholar also stated that the Japanese Emperor was by no means a "constitutional monarch" like the British Emperor. Although the authority of fire was in the hands of the military during the war, the Emperor still retained at least one-third of the decision-making power. This could be seen from Japan's unconditional surrender, or even more than that. Therefore, if it is said that the Emperor has no responsibility for war crimes, it is too much to exonerate him. As for the issue of the Emperor's abolition, it is also worth studying. The Emperor is above the constitution. Before the war, the Japanese legal scholar Tatsukichi Minobe was imprisoned for advocating that the Emperor was within the constitution. His quality in Japanese traditional psychology can be imagined. How to use strict supervision and re-education to completely eliminate the aggressive thoughts and systems attached to the Emperor's superstition is the most important thing.

### Allied Headquarters Cancels Restrictions on Private Representatives Traveling to Japan for Trade

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] According to Yang Ligong, Director of the Trade Representative Office in Japan, MacArthur's headquarters opened private trade with Japan on August 15th of last year, but imposed restrictions on the number of private representatives from various countries traveling to Japan, with a proportional allocation. China was allocated 64 slots. This restriction has recently been announced by the Foreign Affairs Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters. According to a special statement recently issued by the bureau, all people from various countries who wish to engage in trade with Japan or settle property can now freely apply for entry and may bring cars. If they can solve their own housing problems, their families and servants will also be allowed to enter. Their length of stay has also been extended from the 21st to 60 days, and they can apply for semi-permanent residence for more than 60 days. If the work they are engaged in is proven to be beneficial to the revival of the Japanese economy, they may be allowed to reside there for a long time.

### Committee for Evaluating Reparations in Kind Appoints Committee Members

### The Inside Story of the Communist Bandits in the Northeast

[Continued from Page 1] Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, and Linkou are located between 175 and 180 miles from Harbin. Harbin is a major military base and a springboard for the Chinese Communists to advance south and attack the National Army in the Northeast and North China. Harbin and Jiamusi are the main centers of general military and political activities. Due to the large-scale development of the two places by the Chinese Communists, they do not seem to worry about the loss of the two places. Obviously, the battle of Yan'an taught the Chinese Communists that the "depth defense" of the headquarters is better than exposing the entire administrative organization to the front line. The headquarters of the "Democratic Allied Army" is located in Harbin. The overall strategy of the Communist Party's activities is planned there and then implemented in various places, from the Northeast through Central China to Guangdong. Li Lisan is also stationed in Harbin. It is feared that there is no one among the Chinese Communist leaders who hates the United States more than Li Lisan. Li's official title is "Minister of Fortification," which is quite novel. He does not have to build cities with stones everywhere. His responsibility is to guide the establishment of ideological projects to prevent the National Army. In Harbin, there is also the "Supply Department" led by Peng Zhen, the "Administrative Committee" chaired by Lin Feng (with Gao Chongming as the vice chairman of the committee), and the General Headquarters of the "Railway Protection Army" commanded by Lu Zhengcao. It is generally believed that Harbin is Mao Zedong's base camp, but it is believed that Mao often travels between Harbin and Jiamusi. Jiamusi also has the Northeast University, the ideological fortress of the Chinese Communists, as well as the Artillery Academy, the Foreign Language Academy, the Automobile School, the Tank School, and the Rear Hospital Medical College. In addition, in Jiamusi, there is also the "Central Politburo" presided over by Tai Qing (transliteration), whose deputy is Zhou Yuan (transliteration). Bayan is located northeast of Harbin, where there is the Military and Political University, with He Changgong (transliteration) as the president. The school has branches in several cities in the Northeast. Among Mao Zedong's senior staff, no one knows the Soviet Union better than Li Lisan. Li Lisan has participated in the Chinese Communist Party for more than 25 years, but 16 years ago, Li Lisan turned against his old friend Mao Zedong, resulting in the liquidation of the "Li Lisan Line." Li went to the Soviet Union. A year ago, the two reconciled and Li Lisan returned to China. Yoshio Oshima, a Japanese man, said

### North China Contains Large Aluminum Deposits

Yoshio Oshima, a Japanese man, said

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th, United Press] Yoshio Oshima, former founder of Oshima Kogyo Co., Ltd. in Jehol and now a member of the Social Democratic Party, said that China may be the world's largest aluminum producing country, and North China has the natural conditions to build the world's largest aluminum industry. When the Japanese army occupied North China, Oshima studied the mineral deposits in North China and confirmed that North China had the necessary natural conditions for aluminum production. He said that the entire Kailuan Coal Mine is composed of aluminous earth, and aluminous earth is the basic raw material for aluminum production. The electricity can be generated by using Kailuan coal production. This electricity can be supplied almost infinitely. Another essential raw material for aluminum production is cryolite. Natural cryolite is only produced in Iceland, and the cryolite stored there is rapidly depleted. However, it can be made by combining fluorite, and there is a large amount of fluorite along the Luan River, which is not difficult to transport by boat. Oshima pointed out that the above resources are concentrated in a small area of North China, and only capital and technology are needed.

### Consoling Revolutionary and Anti-Japanese War Widows and Orphans in the Capital

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The 20th was the second day of the 14th anniversary of the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement Association, in conjunction with the Ministry of National Defense's Bereavement Affairs Department, the Information Bureau, the Nanjing Consolation Branch, the Bereaved Families School, and the Nanjing Red Cross Branch, jointly organized a consolation meeting for revolutionary and anti-Japanese war widows and orphans. It was held at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the Lishi Society. Before the meeting, the New Life Movement Association dispatched six special military vehicles to welcome the widows and orphans. Despite the rain, over 300 families of widows and orphans attended, most of whom were destitute orphans and widows. At the beginning of the meeting, General Secretary Huang Renlin first reported the significance of the consolation and the donations from various circles. Then, Director Wu Zhongxing of the Bereavement Affairs Department, Deputy Mayor Ma Yuanfang of Nanjing, and President Shen Hui of the Nanjing Red Cross Branch delivered speeches, expressing deep respect, mourning, and infinite sympathy and concern for the comrades who had sacrificed themselves for the country. After the meeting, there was a luncheon with 35 tables of New Life Movement cuisine, donated by the Nanjing Chinese and Western Restaurant Trade Association. The rice was donated by the students of the Bereaved Families School, who saved their rations for one day. The school also specially purchased 150 pounds of fresh milk, which was truly commendable. After the meal, each family received a consolation money of 200,000 yuan, a can of canned food, and soap, toothpaste, toys, and other items donated by the Red Cross. Subsequently, the Ministry of National Defense's magic team performed programs, and the event ended at 1:00 PM.

### Literary and Art Workers Association Holds Second Annual Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The All-China Literary and Art Workers Association held its second annual meeting on the afternoon of the 20th. Over 100 people attended, including Xiang Peiliang and Lü Sibai. Chairman Zhang Daofan and Pan Gongzhan reported on the situation of the Shanghai branch and encouraged writers to use their sharp pens to fight to the death against the evil forces that undermine peace and launch internal disturbances. Xu Zhongnian reported on the literary and art circles in the past year, emphasizing that the launch of the literary revolution movement has created a new era in the history of Chinese literature and art. In the future, writers should use a critical attitude to reflect reality, especially regarding the praise of the bright side. Subsequently, Yu Shangyuan, Zheng Yingsun, Lao Xiang, and Hu Chunbing separately reported on the developments in drama, music, popular literature, and film in the past year. After re-electing the directors and supervisors, the meeting adjourned for a luncheon.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The National Literary and Art Workers Association held its second annual meeting on the 20th. In addition to listening to reports on literary and artistic developments in various regions and electing directors and supervisors, it passed a proposal by Wang Pingling. Wang proposed that all public performances by art groups and individual artists, with certification from the central and local literary and art associations proving that they are purely artistic expressions and not professional entertainment, should be exempt from taxes by the government to show the government's love for artists and its intention to promote art.

### Suzhou Rice Prices Rise Steadily, Market Transactions are Scarce

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] Commodity prices here have not been suppressed. The prices of rice, flour, wheat, and cooking oil have all risen sharply. The retail price of white rice has reached over 2.2 million yuan, and it is still not easy to purchase. Some rice shops are even afraid that it will be difficult to replenish their stocks after selling, so they are either temporarily closing early or simply suspending business. In the rice market, because the Social Affairs Department of the county government is closely monitoring transactions and absolutely does not allow manipulation and speculation to create a black market, it has set a limit price of 1.75 million yuan per stone of white rice. County Magistrate Wang Jiefo also personally came to the market to oversee the situation, which forced those holding goods to wait and see, and transactions were scarce. Only 30 stone of white rice were sold, just enough to appease the government. The weather is overcast and rainy, and few goods have arrived from the countryside, so it is unlikely that the situation will turn around tomorrow.

### Chengdu Prices Surge

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 20th] Chengdu's commodity prices have been hit by a wave of inflation. On the 20th, prices of various goods rose sharply. The price of rice reached a new high of 2.4 million yuan per double stone. Cotton yarn, cloth, gold, silver, and miscellaneous grains also reported price increases.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 20th] Prices in Taiyuan have risen sharply, especially grain prices. In the free market, each bag of flour costs 2.9 million yuan, and each catty of rice costs 48,000 yuan. In order to eradicate the black market, the Price Stabilization Committee has formed an inspection team. The Industrial Bank will resume business within days.

### Local Figures in Nantong Establish Tongcheng Paper Mill

The Industrial Bank will resume business within days.

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 20th] Grain prices have risen dramatically, with the price of top-quality white rice more than 50% higher than last year. The price of cigarettes has not improved, with "Large Chrysanthemum" still unavailable, and "Five Oceans" has also risen. Government controls have not been effective. In addition, the Nantong Office of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee will be formally established soon, and the Nantong Industrial Bank will also resume business within days. Local figure Zhang Tongwu has now raised over 4 billion yuan to establish Tongcheng Paper Mill Co., Ltd. in Tangzha.

### Kailuan Coal Transportation to the South Gradually Increases, Over 50,000 Tons Arrive at Qinhuangdao

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 20th] The amount of Kailuan coal being transported to the south has gradually increased. Recently, the amount of Luan coal transported from Tangshan to Qinhuangdao has reached 4,000 to 5,000 tons per day. As of February 19, over 50,000 tons had arrived at Qinhuangdao. According to the person in charge of Kailuan, it is hoped that at least 200,000 tons of coal can be transported out during the shutdown period, otherwise there will be no way to resume production in the mine. The mine authorities have stipulated that work will resume on the 25th of this month, but due to increased costs, the output after the resumption of work may also need to be reduced, to about 10,000 tons per day. In addition, the Jin-Shen transportation has recently been cut off, and the Jinzhou Railway Bureau has purchased its own train cars for coal, transporting up to 1,000 tons per day.

### Resource Commission Allocates Flour to Relieve Employees in the Northeast

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The Resource Commission will use 300,000 bags of flour to relieve employees remaining in various parts of the Northeast.

### Strong Support for UN Agencies: US Policy Remains Steadfast; Truman and Marshall Express Clearly

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have submitted a joint report to Congress regarding the United Nations agencies. Truman stated that despite disappointments, the UN agencies are still making progress. Marshall also said that although a few member states have been stubborn, the entire organization is making resolute progress. President Truman also stated that the United States will, as in the past, share responsibilities and provide leadership as a member of the United Nations, hoping to encourage every member state to assist the UN agencies in the same spirit to achieve their goals and make its principles have a practical effect on the problems faced by the United Nations. The United States' trust in UN agencies will never diminish. The United States will demonstrate its trust by strongly supporting and participating in the United Nations. Strengthening UN agencies will continue to be the cornerstone of American foreign policy. Recent progress within the UN agencies has had its disappointments, especially regarding the establishment of international atomic energy controls and various political and economic issues directly or indirectly related to international security. However, overall, the UN agencies are still progressing. In addition to mentioning the aforementioned disappointments, Marshall's report also expressed regret over the lack of agreement on the international security force issue and the obstruction by a few countries of the establishment of peace in certain special security issues such as Greece. He also predicted that disagreements will inevitably continue to arise in the future, and that this should not be considered unusual.

### On the Palestine Issue: We Maintain Our Original Position; Liu Kai Participates in Drafting the Jerusalem Statute

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 19th] Chinese representative Liu Kai stated today to the UN Trusteeship Council that his participation in drafting the Jerusalem Statute will not hinder the Chinese government from taking any position on the entire Palestine issue in the future. Ambassador Liu Kai recalled that the Chinese delegation insisted during the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue that any satisfactory solution must be based on the consent of the directly relevant parties. Liu continued that China abstained from voting when the General Assembly voted on the Palestine issue, and the Chinese government's position on the Palestine issue has not changed. Liu explained that the main task of the Trusteeship Council is to draft the Jerusalem Statute, a specialized task that is unrelated to the political aspects of the broader Palestine issue or other matters.

[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The United Nations Palestine Committee recommended organizing an international army. China indicated its unwillingness to support this proposal, dealing it another blow. At today's Security Council vote, at least two of the five major powers will abstain, and possibly three. British Colonial Secretary Jones stated at a press conference on the 18th that Britain will adhere to its abstention policy adopted during last autumn's General Assembly debate on the partition plan. Although the French representative has not indicated, abstention is also possible. However, the United States has not yet announced its position, and the Soviet Union remains secretive. It is generally believed that even with the support of the US and the Soviet Union, this proposal will be difficult to obtain the required seven votes majority out of eleven. Syria opposed the partition in the General Assembly, and Argentina and Colombia also abstained. China's position has been explained by Vice Minister Liu in the Trusteeship Council. [United Press, Cairo, 19th] An Arab League source stated today that the Arab League Political Committee has decided to adopt economic boycotts against the United States and other countries supporting the partition of Palestine, but such boycotts are not intended to be implemented before the United Nations decides to send an international army to Palestine. India and Pakistan are willing to support Vietnam.

### The UN Is Watching the Development of the Situation in Vietnam; India and Pakistan Are Willing to Support Vietnam

[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The Indian and Pakistani delegations both stated today that if the dispute between the Republic of Vietnam and France comes to a showdown within the UN framework, India and Pakistan will support Vietnam. However, they do not wish to take the initiative due to their own domestic affairs. This opinion of the two countries arose from the Arab League's statement of support for Vietnamese independence. Vietnam unsuccessfully attempted to have India bring this case before the UN agencies last autumn. Observers predict that the rapidly deteriorating situation in Vietnam will attract the attention of the United Nations. France is seeking to restore the Annamite King Bao Dai to the throne.

### FAO Conference to Open in the Philippines the Day After Tomorrow

### International Maritime Conference

We Elected Second Vice-Chairman

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th] The International Maritime Conference was held at the United Nations European Office here this afternoon. Thirty-four countries have accepted the invitation to send representatives to the conference. However, Afghanistan, Austria, Bolivia, Czechoslovakia, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, Iraq, Luxembourg, Saudi Arabia, Transjordan, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia have refused to participate. The conference elected Danish representative Oye Hua as chairman, Argentine representative Lambi as first vice-chairman, and Chinese representative Wu Shangru, upon the suggestion of the US representative and seconded by the Indian representative, was elected as second vice-chairman. The conference first conducted a general discussion on the establishment of an international maritime organization. Representatives from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Australia, and Norway opposed the establishment of such an organization, but representatives from China, India, the United States, Canada, and Ireland firmly advocated its establishment. Our representative was elected vice-chairman.

### Unifying Commercial Shipping Regulations: International Conference Opens; Our Representative Elected Vice-Chairman

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 19th] The conference on unifying commercial shipping regulations convened by the United Nations Economic and Social Council opened here today. Attending were delegations from thirty-six countries, and the Chinese representative was elected vice-chairman of the conference. The main issue discussed today was the establishment of an international commercial shipping organization. Representatives from Australia and the three Scandinavian countries advocated establishing a commercial shipping committee directly responsible to the ECOSOC, while representatives from China, the United States, India, and France advocated establishing a permanent international government advisory group and endowing it with great power.

### Rumor That the King of Yemen Died in a Coup

[United Press, Cairo, 20th] A telegram from the Yemeni capital of Sanaa reports that King Yahya of Yemen, 82 years old, three of his sixteen sons, and his chief advisor have died. Prince Ibrahim, known for his opposition to the late king, has been proclaimed the new monarch and will implement constitutional government. The telegram is vague, but Yemeni people here believe the five deaths were the result of a coup. Conspiracies by princes to usurp the throne have been frequent, and this one appears to have succeeded. It is also learned that former Yemeni Prime Minister al-Wazir has been appointed the country's Islamic leader. The whereabouts of the eldest son, the crown prince, and the army commander-in-chief are unknown. It is reported that the country is now calm.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The son of the King of Yemen, al-Islam, arrived here this afternoon by train from London. It is said that his sudden departure from London was due to the assassination of the king.

### Menon Attends Mini-General Assembly to Report on the Korean Situation; Meeting Set to Reconvene Next Tuesday

[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The United Nations Mini-General Assembly convened today to discuss the Korean problem. Indian representative Menon, chairman of the representative delegation stationed in Korea, reported on the failure of efforts to assist in the unification of Korea. He said that since the end of the war, Korea has suffered harsh treatment, and Korean public opinion unanimously believes that the United Nations is their last hope. If this hope is also destroyed, incidents may break out in Korea, becoming a flashpoint for disaster in Asia and the world.

Menon reported to the forty-eight country representatives for one hour and twenty minutes. The Soviet bloc countries still did not participate in the meeting, and Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Paraguay were also absent. Menon also said that the delegation does not wish to admit the inability to implement the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. The delegation unanimously believes that a glimmer of hope for achieving a unified Korean government still exists, and efforts must continue. The United Nations cannot abandon Korea. The Mini-General Assembly then decided by a vote of thirty-seven to one to adjourn until the morning of the 24th to allow the representatives to study Menon's report. The Canadian and Lebanese representatives advocated swift action, while US representative Jessup supported the delay, but stated that the United States considers this issue urgent and that the representative delegation stationed in Korea must continue its work without a doubt. Menon also said that military occupation by Japanese forces went smoothly, but military occupation of Korea has encountered obstacles everywhere, and criticism of US military commander Hodge can be heard everywhere. He personally believes that this is a healthy sign of democracy, better than the Japanese's blind worship of MacArthur. One party estimates North Korean troops at as many as 800,000, while Hodge says only 200,000. In this situation, the United States cannot withdraw its troops from Korea for a considerable period. A recent telegram from Seoul from a certain news agency seems to have caused a misunderstanding. The telegram mentioned the establishment of a puppet government in North Korea, which is misleading. When he arrived at the airport in New York, he asked about the Soviet Union's establishment of a government in Korea, ready to take over South Korea. To the best of our knowledge, the nature of the North Korean regime has not changed recently. The government was established before the visit to Korea by the representative delegation, and the purpose was certainly not to hinder the delegation. At the same time, the delegation received a large amount of evidence in the US military occupation zone regarding the restriction or deprivation of civil rights. This raised questions about whether elections could be conducted freely, and this situation needs to be corrected. Fortunately, the military authorities and the South Korean provisional government have expressed their willingness to do their utmost to guarantee free elections and have already issued preliminary orders in this regard.

### Four Powers Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty; Austria Tends to Accept Soviet Demands

[Reuters, London, 20th] The Four Power representatives' meeting to discuss the Austrian treaty was held here today. It is reported that the US delegation believes the Soviet Union's demands regarding German assets in Austria are still excessive, but Austria is eager for the peace treaty to be concluded so that foreign troops can withdraw as soon as possible, so it is willing to accept the Soviet demands in order to end the occupation. The Soviet Union is demanding roughly two-thirds of Austria's oil production, two-thirds of the oil extraction rights in eastern Austria for fifty years, and refining equipment with an annual output of 450,000 tons. The Soviet Union is also demanding to acquire all the Danube River Shipping Company's assets in Hungary and 55 percent of its assets in Austria, and finally demanding that Austria compensate the Soviet Union 100 million US dollars in cash within two years.

### Truman Campaign Speech: Announces Plan to Prevent Economic Panic

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] President Truman officially launched his campaign for the next presidential term on the 19th, delivering a speech announcing a ten-year plan to expand agricultural production, increase employment, and raise the minimum wage, and stated that this plan can definitely be implemented and will definitely be done. Truman accused the Republican Party of causing rural bankruptcy, business collapse, and labor despair, and should be held responsible for the worst economic panic in history. The president delivered his speech at the Jackson Day celebration attended by more than 1,000 Democratic leaders from across the country.

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] President Truman, while attending the Democratic Jefferson-Jackson Memorial Day dinner on the evening of the 19th, delivered a speech condemning the Congress controlled by the Republican Party for lacking attention to the "truth" of the problems facing the United States today. He also said: He "cannot believe in this group of reactionaries." Truman pointed out that the current Congress "does not understand and does not want to understand all the truth, so the Democratic Party should be responsible for enabling the United States to take the correct direction." He said he hoped to publish the "entire facts" of "reactionary" activities.

### North Korea Organizing a Government Has Not Yet Become a Reality

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Responsible sources close to the State Department stated today that the news from Seoul that the Soviet Union had established a puppet government in North Korea was a misunderstanding of a broadcast by Pyongyang Radio. Pyongyang Radio only stated that the establishment of the North Korean government and its constitution were under consideration, but have not yet been realized. A certain US officer in Seoul was oversensitive, mistakenly thought it had become a reality, and rashly cited it. Britain denies submitting to the United Nations.

### Antarctic Territory Dispute: US and Britain in Talks; Britain Denies Submitting to the United Nations

At the same time, the national election campaign is tense, and the election date has not yet been determined.

### Bulgarian Anti-Communist Leader Claims US-Soviet War Is Hard to Avoid

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] Bulgarian Agrarian Party leader Dimitrov, currently exiled in the United States, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee on the 19th, stating that "the United States is the number one target of world communism," and that traitors in the United States are following Soviet instructions. Once the Communist Party gains power, they will return to rule the Americans. Dimitrov said that a US-Soviet war seems inevitable, but the Soviet Union does not currently want war because they are not ready.

### British Defense Budget Tightened: Military Size to be Reduced to 716,000 Next Year; Maintaining Military Strength to Safeguard National Security

The projected troop numbers for the three armed forces on the first and last days of the fiscal year from April 1, 1948, to March 31, 1949, are as follows: the Navy will be 145,000 for both days. The Army will be 534,000 on April 1 this year and 345,000 on March 31 next year. The Air Force will be 261,000 on April 1 this year and 226,000 on March 31 next year. The allocation of the total military spending of £692.6 million for the fiscal year is as follows: Navy £153 million, Army £305 million, Air Force £173 million, Ministry of Supply £61 million, and Ministry of Defense £600,000. The Ministry of Defense also announced that compulsory military service will continue to be implemented in the coming years, but the conscription age will be gradually raised from 18 to 18 years and 9 months. The Ministry of Defense also stated that the government is determined to retain the military strength to support its international position, safeguard its national security, maintain its global interests, and enable Britain to share the responsibility of maintaining world peace.

### Shigeru Yoshida and Hitoshi Ashida Fiercely Compete for Prime Minister; Left-Wing Socialist Party Still Supports Katayama

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 20th] It is reported that a fierce competition will take place between Liberal Party leader Yoshida and Democratic Party leader Ashida in the election of the new prime minister in the Japanese parliament on the afternoon of the 21st. Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio declared on the 20th that the election competition is between Liberal Party Yoshida and Democratic Party Ashida. Ashida clearly stated on the 20th that he opposes Katayama's resignation as prime minister, but the left-wing socialist parties in both houses are still planning to support him to take office.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The question of who will succeed as Japan's next prime minister has now become the central topic of discussion in Japanese political circles and among the general public. The Democratic Party had already resolved on the 19th to unanimously support President Ashida. The Liberal Party is adhering to Yoshida, and the conservative small association faction seems to have a tendency to merge with them. Only the attitude of the Socialist Party has not yet been determined. Although the right wing hopes to support Ashida, the left wing firmly disagrees. Therefore, the right wing deeply fears a party split that would undermine its determination to support Ashida as prime minister to the end. From this, it is also believed that in the nomination vote on the 21st, Katayama may still be nominated again. It is generally believed that the attitude of the National Cooperative Party on the 21st nomination may affect the prime ministerial candidate. If the National Cooperative Party supports Ashida, then the result of the vote will be Ashida, Yoshida, and Katayama in that order, but none will exceed a majority. However, Ashida's chances of being elected are very high. Conversely, if the National Cooperative Party supports Yoshida, then Yoshida's hopes of being elected are extremely high. Also, if they support Katayama, then the order of election will be Katayama, Yoshida, and Ashida. At this time, the attitude of the Democratic Party will still determine which of Katayama and Yoshida wins. Regarding the issue of Japan's next prime minister, the most noteworthy aspects at present are the Democratic Party's policy agreement with the Socialist Party and the movements of the National Cooperative Party.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese House of Councillors also officially decided to implement the nomination vote for the next prime minister at 1:00 p.m. on the 21st. The Green Breeze Society, which has the largest number of members, can control the decision, so its movements are extremely important. So far, the majority of them seem to support Liberal Party President Yoshida. Secondly, the movements of more than 40 members of the Socialist Party are also noteworthy. Although it is expected that Yoshida can be elected in the House of Councillors, the margin is extremely small, so it is still difficult to determine.

### Democratic Party Redrafts the Four-Party Policy Agreement Plan

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] After the Democratic Party sent the policy agreement plan to the Socialist, Liberal, and National Cooperative parties separately, the Liberal Party formally rejected it. The Socialist Party also complained that the content was empty and demanded the addition of specific opinions. Therefore, the party drafted a specific four-party policy agreement yesterday and submitted it to the Socialist and National Cooperative parties. Its content consists of the following five items: (1) Comprehensive production enhancement countermeasures; (2) Inflation prevention countermeasures; (3) National management of important industries; (4) Labor-management coordination plans such as peaceful resolution of disputes; (5) Central and local tax system reorganization plan. It can be submitted to the Army Department for review.

### MacArthur Revising US Cotton Loan Plan for Japan: Can Be Submitted to the Army Department for Review Soon

[Associated Press Liaison Office, Tokyo, 20th] The US syndicate's plan to lend Japan $60 million to purchase US cotton has been slightly modified by MacArthur and can be returned to the US Army Department for review soon.

### Shunroku Hata and Sadao Araki, etc., Indicted by International Court

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Today's indictment by the International Tribunal's Prosecutor's Office accuses Shunroku Hata of intentionally promoting Hideki Tojo to power in order to lead Japan quickly into war with England and Italy. Due to Tojo's appointment as Minister of the Army, the entire cabinet was subsequently placed under the control of the Army. The indictment further states that Kanji Doihara, as commander of the Japanese forces stationed in China, led Japanese troops into the heart of China in an attempt to transform the Chinese government into a local regime and ultimately destroy it completely. In 1939, when he served as Minister of the Army, he fully supported and sponsored the large-scale war of aggression in China. He is also responsible for the crimes committed by the Japanese troops in China from March 1941 to November 1944. Because the Japanese troops under his command engaged in various crimes such as arson, murder, rape, looting, and kidnapping.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] According to the International Military Tribunal's indictment against Sadao Araki, the former Japanese Minister of the Army and Minister of Education, Araki stated in 1933 that those who oppose Japan's expansion into Northeast China and the policies of the Japanese Empire "should be dealt with with bullets and bayonets." The prosecutor read Araki's indictment stating that during his time in office, he followed this policy of armed aggression. He frequently drafted plans for aggression publicly or secretly and taught the Japanese people to expand military aggression. Araki agreed to place "Manchukuo" under the control of the Kwantung Army during his time as Minister of the Army. He admitted that he had drafted plans to occupy Jehol and other three provinces in North China. Araki also admitted that the Japanese cabinet's decision in 1931 to occupy the four northeastern provinces was the result of his plan. After Araki became Minister of Education, the propaganda launched by Japan to defend its aggressive actions was also greatly strengthened. In a certain film, Araki can be seen shouting loudly, admonishing the Japanese people to follow the plans of their military leaders to conquer the world. He also used the slogan of "Co-Prosperity Sphere" as a rallying cry, and his demeanor resembled that of Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 20th] Former Japanese Prime Ministers Hiranuma and Hirota, defendants in the war crimes trials, were brought before the Far East International Tribunal today to hear the prosecutors' indictments against them. Hirota was a disciple of the leader of the Black Dragon Society, an organization composed of extreme Japanese nationalists. His main crime was implementing Japan's policy of aggression against China. The elderly Hiranuma, who served as President of the Privy Council for many years and had a great influence on Japanese political circles, was accused of supporting Konoe's policy towards China. On June 10, 1939, he met with Wang Jingwei and allowed him to support the puppet government. On May 4 of the same year, he told Hitler that Japan could provide military assistance to Germany if necessary. Next Monday is Washington's Birthday, and the International Court will suspend hearings for one day.

### Dismantling Japanese Armaments: Pan Youxin Reiterates His Position

Says the Soviet Union's Attitude in the Far Eastern Commission is Impartial

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, today submitted a written statement to the American press, stating that American newspapers published "biased and coercive" articles, calling the Soviet Union a "disruptive element" in the Far Eastern Commission. The Soviet Union lodges a serious protest against this. The Soviet Union's statements in the Far Eastern Commission have been flawless, its purpose being merely to clarify certain key points. The majority of members of the commission also agree with the Soviet Union's views. The Soviet Union reserved its opinion and did not vote in favor of the proposal to expand the commission's organization and take necessary steps to ensure Japan's thorough demilitarization because the Soviet Union's supplementary proposal was rejected. However, to call the Soviet Union a "disruptive element" simply because it used its veto power is extremely absurd and ridiculous. Regarding Pakistan's application to join the Far Eastern Commission, it is also a misunderstanding that the Soviet Union refused its participation. The Soviet Union only advocated discussing this issue at the next meeting so that the representatives present could consult their governments. It also stated that the Soviet Union has the following two main points to supplement the Japanese demilitarization proposal: (1) Restrict the Japanese military police to using only "small arms" to maintain law and order; (2) Ensure that all confiscated Japanese military equipment is completely destroyed within six months at the latest. Its conclusion states: American newspapers distort the report, saying that the Soviet Union is a "disruptive element" in the Far Eastern Commission, which only causes public opinion to be terrified.

### Meteorite Explodes Over American Skies

[Central News Agency, Garnett, Kansas, 19th, United Press] Authorities announced that the terrifying explosion heard over Kansas last night was caused by a meteorite entering the Earth's atmosphere and exploding due to friction with the air. A scientist in New York said that reports indicate that the meteorite must have been extremely large, and if it had fallen in a residential area, the loss would have been great. When the meteorite exploded, its intense vibration caused residents of Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma to panic. Glass windows shattered, and houses shook. Before the explosion, the meteorite emitted a plume of cyan-white smoke, rising horizontally into the sky. The meteorite seemed to have completely disintegrated on the ground, and despite extensive searches, no fragments were found. Second Highest in National Income

### Deanna Durbin

Second Highest in National Income

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The Treasury Department announced that the three men who earned the most money in the United States during the ten quarters from 1944 to 1946 were movie mogul Mayer, and the woman who earned the most was movie star Deanna Durbin. Mayer held the record for the highest individual income for eight of the past nine years. In the year ending August 1945, his income from Loew's Pictures was $502,571. The second highest was producer Wanger, with an income of $282,900. Deanna Durbin's annual income was $262,875. The aforementioned income only includes income from special companies and not total personal income. According to records from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mayer's income in 1946 reached $898,571, while the Treasury Department announced that Deanna Durbin's total income in 1946 was $310,728, ranking second in national personal income and first in women's personal income.

### The Memoirs of Cordell Hull (27)

— Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance. Translated by this newspaper's editorial department.

Without a Word, Turn Around, and Walk Away

The proposal I gave to Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu on November 26th (i.e., the ten-point peaceful resolution plan) was a sincere effort to maintain our negotiations and continue the process. We placed unwavering hope on it, hoping that even at the last minute, some sense of reason could penetrate the minds of the Eastern militarists.

Soon, Japanese propaganda—especially after Japan began to suffer severe defeats—attempted to distort our November 26th memorandum, calling it an "ultimatum." This is a characteristic trait of the Japanese: using completely fabricated excuses to deceive their people and gain their support for military plunder.

Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu themselves admitted that the responsibility for the breakdown of relations with us lay with Japan. On the same day, November 26th, they sent a telegram to Tokyo, which was intercepted by our army and navy. This telegram suggested shifting the responsibility to us. They said: If we deliberately begin our planned actions during these negotiations, then the responsibility for the interruption of negotiations is in danger of shifting to us. Previously, she (the United States) could have considered suspending negotiations because of our invasion of Vietnam. Now, if we interrupt our negotiations without clarifying our intentions and suddenly begin unilateral action, then I am afraid she will use this point as anti-propaganda against us.

From the telegram that Foreign Minister Togo sent to Nomura and Kurusu on November 28th, one can see what was about to happen. This telegram stated that negotiations with us would soon be interrupted, but also stated: "I do not want you to create an impression that the negotiations have already been interrupted. You can merely tell them that you are waiting for instructions and state: although you do not yet know your government's views, in your opinion, the demands made by the Imperial government have always been very fair and have suffered great sacrifices to maintain peace in the Pacific."

In other words, the second stage of Kurusu's mission had arrived. The first stage was to force us to accept Japan's hegemony in the East. After this failed, the first task was to confuse us with talks before the White forces were ready to attack.

On November 29th, I saw the excerpts from the speeches that Tojo and Togo were preparing to deliver at the joint conference of the Greater Japan East Asia League and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association on November 30th. One passage in Tojo's telegram said: "Chiang Kai-shek is colluding with Britain, America, and communism, sacrificing strong men and promising youth for ineffective resistance against Japan. This fact is only for Britain and America to fish in troubled waters in East Asia, pitting East Asian nations against each other so that they can seize hegemony in East Asia... For the sake of human glory and self-esteem, we must drive this behavior out of East Asia." After consideration, I discussed this with our military authorities and Far East experts, and repeatedly studied various reports we had previously received regarding Japan's new actions in Vietnam. That night (November 29th), I called the President, emphasized the crisis of a Japanese attack, and urged him to return to Washington earlier. The President agreed.

President Roosevelt arrived in Washington on the morning of Monday, December 1st. Before he arrived, Nomura and Kurusu came to the State Department to visit me and asked me why the President had returned to the capital early. The Japanese envoys were obviously afraid that the President's return to Washington would conflict with their instructions to confuse us with negotiations. I said that one of the reasons was the Japanese Prime Minister's grandiose statements.

On December 5th, I sent instructions by radio to our diplomatic representatives in Tokyo and other locations in the Far East, instructing them to destroy codes, secret vaults, passports, etc., and close offices, dismiss local staff, and, in case of emergency, cut off communication with the State Department.

On the next day, December 6th, we seemed to feel that the long-threatened Japanese military advance to the south was underway.

The President believed that the time had come for him to send a telegram to the Emperor of Japan. He sent me a draft of the telegram, which was similar in content to the draft telegram I had sent him the previous week. I and my colleagues read it and believed that some of the wording should be revised for technical accuracy. After we revised it, we sent the draft back to the White House. That same evening, Mr. Roosevelt sent it back to me, unchanged, with a letter attached stating: "Dear Cordell: Send this telegram to Grew quickly. I think it can be used with the "gray code" (note: the gray code is the least secret code of the US State Department). This can save time, and I am not afraid of the telegram being intercepted—Roosevelt."

On Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, I went to the office as usual. Since entering the State Department in 1935, I have worked almost every Sunday.

On this morning, I received a series of intercepted telegrams, including a long telegram consisting of fourteen sections from Foreign Minister Togo to Nomura and Kurusu. This was a response to our November 26th proposal. Attached to the long telegram was a short telegram instructing the ambassador to present the original telegram to our government today. If possible, the time should be 1:00 PM that afternoon. This was the final moment.

The Japanese note was worse than an insult. The telegram said that our proposal "disregards Japan's sacrifices in the four-year China Incident, threatens the survival of the Empire itself, and impairs its honor and dignity." The telegram also said that we conspired with Britain and other countries to hinder Japan's efforts to establish a new order and peace in East Asia. The telegram concluded: "In view of the attitude of the United States Government, the Japanese Government has had no other choice but to consider that it is impossible to reach an agreement through further negotiations."

This note did not declare war, nor did it sever diplomatic relations. Japan did not need these preliminary steps to begin its attack.

Around noon, Ambassador Nomura called me and requested that I meet with him and Kurusu at 1:00 PM. I accepted his request.

A few minutes after one o'clock, Nomura called me again and requested that the appointment be postponed to 1:45 PM. I agreed.

The Japanese envoys arrived at the State Department at 2:05 PM and went straight to the diplomatic waiting room. Around this time, the President called me from the White House. His voice was very calm, but also a little urgent.

He said: "There is a report that Japan has attacked Pearl Harbor." I asked: "Has the telegram been confirmed?" He said: "No."

We both thought that this report might be true, but I suggested that he should find a way to confirm it. At that time, I thought of my appointment with the Japanese envoys.

With me in the office were Legal Advisor Hackworth and Berle. Berle was usually present when I negotiated with the Japanese. I said to them:

"The President has received an unconfirmed report that Japan has attacked Pearl Harbor. The Japanese envoys are waiting to see me, and I know what they want. They will reject our November 26th note, and maybe they will tell us, declaring war. I am reluctant to receive him."

But after consideration, I decided to receive them, because the report received by the President had not been confirmed. Maybe there was a one percent chance that this report was incorrect. I roughly discussed with Hackworth and Berle what I was going to say to the Japanese envoys. When I ordered the Japanese envoys to be received, Hackworth left, while Berle stayed in the room.

Nomura and Kurusu entered my office at 2:20 PM. I greeted them coldly and did not ask them to sit down.

Nomura said in an overly humble manner: his government instructed him to present us with a note at 1:00 PM this afternoon, but it was late because of the difficulty in translating the telegram. Then he handed me his government's note.

I asked him why he specified 1:00 PM when he first requested to see me. He said he did not know, but said that this was the instruction he had received.

I pretended to read the note. I knew its content in advance, but of course I could not show this fact.

After reading two or three sections, I asked Nomura: whether he was presenting this document under his government's instructions. He said yes. After I read it roughly, I faced Nomura and looked at him intently.

I said: "I must state that in the past nine months of negotiations with you, I have never said a dishonest word. This can absolutely be proven by facts. In my fifty years of government service, I have never seen a document including so much shameless hypocrisy and distortion—the extent of its shameless hypocrisy and distortion is so great that until today, I never thought that any government in the current world could say it.

Nomura did not seem to say anything. His expression was calm, but I felt that he was under great emotional stress. I rescued him with a gesture. I nodded towards the door, and the Japanese envoys turned around, walked away, and bowed their heads without saying a word.

In the rich language of the Tennessee Mountains, I had "cursed the Japanese envoys away," but in fact I had told them what I had said above. There has never been a more intense degree of "cursing away" than this time.

Berle recorded what I said. After the Japanese envoys left, I immediately called my stenographer in and read out what I had said to them from memory. This was the same as what I released to the press. Nomura's last meeting with me was as clumsy as his previous handling of discussions. His government instructed him to arrange to meet me at 1:00 PM, the purpose was to hand the note to me a few minutes before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Nomura's embassy falsely claimed that it was due to the slowness of translating the telegram. But since Nomura knew the importance of the deadline, even if he only received the first few lines of the note, he should have instructed the embassy to send the subsequent translations to the State Department, and he himself should have come to see me at 1:00 PM. Therefore, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor without warning, probably more than an hour before Nomura and Kurusu presented the note.

Shortly after the Japanese envoys left, I spoke to the President on the phone and repeated to him what I had told the Japanese envoys. He expressed satisfaction that I had spoken so forcefully, but by that time, he had already received reports about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

After 3 PM, I went to the White House and talked with the President and other figures for forty minutes. Mr. Roosevelt was very serious in his attitude and conversation. The magnitude of the gains Japan had made in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was already very clear. But I saw that neither he nor we lost confidence for a moment in America's ability to deal with the crisis.

### Draft of Housing Rent Standards Passed: Adjusted Every Three Months, Calculated Based on the Average of the Previous Three Months' Housing Index; To Be Implemented After Being Submitted to the Senate for Resolution

[This Newspaper News] Recently, the cost of living index has continued to rise, and housing owners' income cannot cover expenses. In order to handle housing rent disputes, the Land Administration Bureau has formulated the "Provisional Measures for Housing Rental Management in This City," which was promulgated and implemented on August 9, 1947. Now, the bureau, after inviting representatives from relevant agencies and organizations in the city, has held repeated consultations and, after integrating opinions from all parties, has drafted the "Draft of Housing Rent Standards in This City," which was submitted and passed at yesterday's city government meeting and will be sent to the Senate for resolution and implementation. The following is a record of the housing rent standards: (1) The housing rent in this city shall be based on the rent amount in 1937. If the pre-war rent amount cannot be verified or the house was built after 1937, the base amount shall be estimated by the Land Administration Bureau with reference to nearby similar houses. (2) The maximum rent for residential houses shall be based on the average of the housing class indices for civil servants and workers in the city for the previous three months. (3) The maximum rent for houses inhabited by teachers shall not exceed 10% of the cost of living index for public school teachers and civil servants. The aforementioned public school teachers and civil servants are limited to those whose salaries are indeed calculated according to the cost of living index for public school teachers and civil servants. Those who have already received housing subsidies are not subject to this provision. (4) The provisions of the preceding article shall apply to houses rented by schools, charitable organizations, autonomous agencies, cultural organizations, and houses with a rent base of less than 10 legal tender. (5) The rent for houses newly built after the promulgation of the "Fundamental Measures for Solving the Housing Shortage in This City" on August 16, 1946, shall not be subject to the restrictions of this standard. (6) If a dispute arises between the parties to the lease due to the payment of rent, they may apply to the Land Administration Bureau for mediation in accordance with the provisions of Article 101 of the Land Law. (7) This standard shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Land Administration Bureau Explains the Method of Rent Adjustment

Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the Land Administration Bureau, who spoke to reporters: The "Draft of Housing Rent Standards in Shanghai" passed at the municipal government meeting this morning, item two refers to the rent for residential houses, and the maximum rent shall be based on the average of the housing class indices for civil servants and workers in the city for the previous three months. That is, the housing index will be adjusted every three months from now on, and the rent for the subsequent three months will be calculated based on the average index of the housing class indices for civil servants and workers in the previous three months. For example, the rent for the three months of "April," "May," and "June" this year will be calculated based on the average index of the three months of "January," "February," and "March." The following will be inferred in the same way, and it will be announced by the Municipal Statistics Office every three months. In addition, all sub-tenants in the city will also comply with the housing rent standards.

### Chamber of Commerce Opposes Calculation According to Index

[This Newspaper News] Wang Lianfang, Liu Xiexun, Jiang Zhonghe, Sun Wenyi, and other directors and supervisors of the Nanjing Road Chamber of Commerce, in order to oppose the calculation of rent according to the cost of living index, specially hosted guests from all walks of life at the Dadong Restaurant at 6:00 PM yesterday, including municipal senators Guo Lingshuang, Shao Yongsheng, Zheng Shouchi, Mei Hao, Zhang Yiqu, Fei Shusheng, Yin Jiqian, Wang Xingtong, Chen Cunren, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shi Zhifu, Ma Junshuo, Yang Fusheng, Lao Zha District Chief Li Ruchun, lawyer Zheng Wenkai, and more than 50 representatives from industrial and commercial circles. Opinions were exchanged during the meeting, and everyone expressed sympathy. The Chamber of Commerce firmly stated that the adjustment of rent should absolutely not be calculated according to the cost of living index, for the following reasons: (1) Rent cannot be calculated based on materials. Not only is there a legal regulation, but the authorities also issued a prohibition early on. Now, the Land Administration Bureau is convening a meeting to calculate according to the cost of living index, which is tantamount to collecting rent according to materials, which violates laws and regulations. (2) The calculation of the cost of living index is based on the average of expenditures for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If rent is calculated according to the cost of living index again, it will be reversing cause and effect, rising each other. The cost of living index will rise endlessly. (3) If rent can be calculated according to the cost of living index, then all prices can use the cost of living index as an excuse for calculation. (4) The cost of building houses before the war was similar to the interest rate on bank deposits before the war. Today, banks already have clear regulations on the payment of pre-war deposits. Now, rent has increased many times more than pre-war deposits, and it must not be increased again. (5) If we want to alleviate the housing shortage, we can only encourage the construction of new houses, because the cost of building new houses is different, and the rent for new houses is originally not restricted. (6) According to the law, rent should originally be based on land prices. Currently, rent has already exceeded the legally allowable multiple of land prices by a great deal. (7) After the victory, due to the war and chaos caused by the communist bandits, the people have all endured painful sacrifices. It is hoped that after the bandits are pacified, the legal tender will be stable. Real estate developers are all members of the bourgeoisie, and they alone cannot endure it for a while, only seeking profit, wanting to drastically increase rent, so as to cause the cost of living index to rise and make the majority of the people bear a heavier burden. If this causes all prices to skyrocket, it will violate the original intention of the authorities to suppress prices. (8) If we say that rent is calculated according to the cost of living index, it is taking care of the rights of a small number of owners. May I ask, the majority of farmers in our country work hard to grow rice. The authorities still consider the whole country and prevent the prices from skyrocketing. Farmers' suffering should be considered before real estate developers. (9) Before the war, owners collected rent, including tap water, house donations, repair fees, and management fees. Now, all of the above fees are paid by the tenants themselves. The owner only has the expense of paying land tax obligations and the cost of rent collectors. What huge expenses can be said to exist? (10) Among the various agencies convened by the Land Administration Bureau to discuss rent, only representatives of the real estate industry spoke, while not a single member of the various tenant associations representing the city's residents was invited to participate and state their reasons, which is clearly biased.

### Director Fang is Ill from Overwork and is Going to Beijing to Resign to the Central Government

Fang Xikong, director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang, has spared no effort in promoting party affairs since he took office in October of last year. However, recently, due to overwork, he has suffered from severe back pain. After medical diagnosis, it was determined that it was caused by overwork and requires long-term rest. Mr. Fang also believes that he is physically weak and cannot take on such heavy responsibilities, so he has decided to resign from his current position to the Central Committee. It is also heard that he took the night train to Beijing last night to plead with the Central Committee to grant his request.

### The City Plans to Conduct Statistics for Per Capita Rice Rationing: Monthly Demand is 450,000 Shi; Songshan District Has the Most Rice Stores

In order to stabilize prices and people's livelihoods, the government will begin comprehensive per capita rice rationing in Shanghai on the 16th of next month, stipulating one dou per person per month, regardless of the size of the family. The relevant organizers are now actively preparing for the implementation work. The public is concerned about how much rice the city needs in total and how many rice stores will be allocated. It is learned that the Materials Allocation Advisory Committee has already prepared statistics, based on the total population announced by the Civil Affairs Bureau at the end of last year, a total of 449,439 city shi of rice are needed each month. If rice stores are limited to those with grain business licenses, there are a total of 1,935 rice stores in 31 districts, including Baoshan, Wusong, and Zhenru. The district with the most rice stores is Songshan District, with 156 stores, followed by Yimiao District, with 137 stores, Yangjing District with 129 stores, Zhabei District with 125 stores, and Xincheng District with 115 stores. The allocation price will be 95% of the current market price.

### Judicial Officials Must Undergo Administrative Investigation Before Being Accused

### The "Jiang Ya" Steamer Was Not Delayed, The "Jiang Ping" Steamer Is Pulled Away From Hanyang

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo line steamer "Jiang Ya" returned to Shanghai from Ningbo the day before yesterday. Due to inclement weather and dense fog, navigation was hampered, causing it to arrive at the port as late as 4 PM. To maintain the schedule, coal was burned at around 6 PM to sail back to Ningbo. However, due to the lateness of the hour and the falling tide, it ran aground at the Wusongkou at around 8 PM that evening. Yesterday morning, around 7 AM, it floated on its own with the rising tide and continued sailing to Ningbo. It is reported that it set sail back to Shanghai yesterday evening, will arrive at the port this morning, and can still depart for Ningbo at 4 PM this afternoon, without any delay to the schedule.

The "Jiang Ping" steamer ran aground at Jinji upstream of Nantong last Saturday evening. It has now been rescued by the "Guo Tai" steamer and two landing crafts, numbers 305 and 310. It has safely navigated the danger and continues to sail upstream to Hankou. The "Guo Tai" and the landing crafts have successively returned to Shanghai yesterday.

### The Third Group Meeting of the Committee for Examining Enemy and Puppet Occupied Civilian Land in Shanghai:

### Farmland used by the experimental farm; voluntarily relinquished nearly ten thousand mu; the remainder to be decided after a survey by representatives.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Third Group of the Committee for Examining Enemy and Puppet Occupied Civilian Land used by Central Agencies in Shanghai under the Executive Yuan, held its first review meeting at the Land Administration Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Representatives from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Resources Commission, Municipal Council, Municipal Government, Lawyers Association, and Central Trust Bureau attended. Zhu Ping, the Director of the Land Administration Bureau, also attended. The meeting was chaired by the group convenor, Xiang Yuanquan.

Among the eighteen cases reviewed, the largest was the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Economic Experimental Farm receiving and using a total of seventy-four units of enemy and puppet occupied civilian land. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry stated its willingness to voluntarily relinquish ten units (totaling over 9,964 mu in area), but requested to retain the use of fourteen units (totaling over 4,706 mu in area). After review, it was decided that the sixty units voluntarily relinquished by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry would be returned to the owners. Regarding the fourteen units for which continued use was requested, the review decided that most must still be returned. For the remaining part of the land, it was decided to dispatch Zhu Ping (Land Administration Bureau), Xiang Changquan, Yang Shukang (Municipal Council), Shen Naizheng (Municipal Government), Chen Guanqiu (Central Trust Bureau), and Wu Xiangxian (Lawyers Association) to conduct an on-site survey, and then submit it to the next meeting for a final decision.

### Finance Bureau Increases Tax Rates on Six Items; Amended Collection Rules Sent to the Council Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] With the Fifth General Meeting of the Municipal Council approaching, the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday submitted detailed explanations of the amended collection rules for six types of taxes (banquets, entertainment, slaughter, business licenses, vehicle licenses, and house tax) to the Municipal Council for resolution at the general meeting. The amendment involves raising the tax rates on various taxes, with the following key points: The old regulations had two levels of 10% and 20%. After being approved by the Municipal Council as a uniform 15%, the new tax law stipulates a uniform 20%. The original tax threshold has been cancelled and replaced with a "tax-free standard." The "tax-free standard" is to be drafted by the Finance Bureau according to Article 4 of the Banquet and Entertainment Tax Law, based on local prices. Furthermore, the banquet tax shall be levied on customers of all occupations, and no exemptions shall be granted without legal basis.

Entertainment Tax: The old law was 25%. This municipality reduced it to 20% for plays, as the cost of plays is relatively high, and the remaining 25%.

The above taxation cannot be exempted without legal basis.

### The Qingfu Transportation Company Was Completely Destroyed; Workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard Sought Out People and Destroyed Three Vehicles, Injuring Seven; Police Suppressed the Incident and Arrested Many Troublemakers

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Qingfu Transportation Company on Dongchang Road in Pudong was suddenly attacked by more than a hundred workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard at about 6 PM yesterday, and the company was completely destroyed. Three vehicles were damaged, causing more than 100,000,000 yuan in damage. The drivers Wang Hejin, Zhou Haihua, and ticket sellers Zhang Lugen and Zhang Zhiying were injured, as well as three members of the Yang Deshan, Guan Rentai, and Zhu Chengshan of the Third Brigade of the First Battalion of the security police. They were taken to the Municipal Third Hospital for treatment. A rifle was also lost and has not yet been found. During the chaos, shops closed one after another, and pedestrians rushed to avoid the violence, causing great disorder. After the Yangjing Police Station received a report, Director Yang personally led a large number of police officers to suppress the incident, and arrested more than 40 troublemakers and more than 10 members of the shipyard's security team, along with the guard team member Li Make, and took them to the police station to inquire about the incident, and reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation. It is reported that the cause of the incident was that more than 200 workers from the former Nong Shipyard took buses to the Dongchang Road ferry, heading to Shanghai, but none of them bought tickets. Ticket seller Shi Jianhong and others persuaded them to buy tickets, and each paid the minimum fare of 3,000 yuan, which angered them. After arriving at their destination, they beat Shi and dispersed.

### Eventful Time for the General Manager of Xin Sui; Zhu Bing Accused of Breach of Contract Again; Dispute Arises over Contract for Shipping Antiques; Palace Museum Files a Complaint for Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zhu Bing, the general manager of Xin Sui Company, has recently been accused of breach of contract and bad faith by Ma Heng, the director of the Palace Museum, and Huang Nianchou, the section chief, who filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office. The Palace Museum stored its antiques in Chongqing, Leshan, and Emei during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, it was necessary to concentrate them in Chongqing for transportation. Six hundred four-ton trucks were needed, and it would take two months to complete the transportation. At that time, only Xin Sui Company in Chongqing had this capability, so they contacted Xin Sui Company. The vehicle rental and fuel costs were paid in advance at one-quarter of the amount stipulated by the Ministry of Communications Highway Administration, totaling more than 260 million legal tender. After Zhu signed the contract, he never fulfilled the contract, and only used three or four old trucks for transportation. He delayed until July 1946. After three months, the antiques were still not concentrated. When the Palace Museum urged him, Zhu claimed that there was a shortage of vehicles. So the Palace Museum sent personnel to accompany Zhu to the Highway Administration to borrow 100 trucks. The cost should be paid by Zhu, but the Palace Museum paid 483,300,000 yuan in advance. After the transportation was completed, it was settled in March 1947 and he was asked to return the money, but he ignored it. Because Zhu had various facts of breach of contract and bad faith, the Palace Museum yesterday filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office requesting an investigation.

### Impersonating Paper Mill Extorters; Three Criminals Confess Inside Information

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Three men in uniforms suddenly came to the Qinkong Paper Mill on Xietu Road on the morning of the day before yesterday, claiming to be members of the Inspection Brigade and came to search for hoarding of materials. Manager Li Kunquan received them and explained that all the raw materials stored in the factory were for the production of paper materials. The three men insisted on taking Li away, but after the factory director Xu Shaoliang pleaded, they agreed to contact him at Dasanyuan in the afternoon, and the three men left. Afterwards, the factory reported the incident to the Songshan Police Station, who sent undercover police officers to wait. When the three men arrived and demanded that Xu pay 100 million yuan before the matter could be settled, and agreed to pay the money the next day, the police officers did not arrest them at that time because of insufficient evidence. Yesterday afternoon, the factory prepared 20 million yuan in cash and 80 million yuan in checks at the original location. Just as the two parties were delivering the money, they were arrested. After being taken to the station for interrogation, they confessed that one was Chen Dehua, one was Li Yongchang, and one was Wan Changtai, and they admitted that they had impersonated extortionists, and confessed to the inside information of Ni Zhixiang.

### American Petroleum Company Employee's Greed: Embezzlement of 7 Billion Solved; Dividing Into Small Amounts, Preparing to Flee to Hong Kong; After Arrest, Calmly Said "Success Depends on Heaven"

[Our Newspaper's Report] The American Petroleum Company in this city suffered an embezzlement of 7 billion yuan in funds by collection clerk Huang Limin on the 2nd of this month. Afterward, Huang disappeared without a trace. It was not until the morning of the 4th that the company's chief accountant, Shi Hengsi, discovered the matter. He immediately reported it to the Detective Section of the Police Department. The Section Chief ordered Tao Genrong, the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Investigation Unit, and officers Chen Fukang and Zhang Jinkui to handle the investigation. On the afternoon of the same day, around 4 p.m., they managed to arrest the suspect Huang and successively recovered 6 billion yuan of the stolen funds. The case was finally concluded yesterday, and it is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today. Huang, originally from Guangdong and only 25 years old, is a graduate of St. John's University in this city. He currently resides at 53 East Changzhi Road. During the war, he served as a second lieutenant officer in the Southeast Cadre Training Group of the Central Military Academy. After the victory, he was assigned to Shanghai to work for the Naval Department. Last year, he resigned for some reason and then got a job as a collection clerk at the American Petroleum Company. He was usually silent and reserved and was deeply

trusted by his superiors. Unfortunately, in June of last year, he was hit by an American military vehicle and injured his left leg. After recovering and returning to work, the expenses for medical treatment and other things were too high, and he felt financial difficulties. The company's

incoming and outgoing funds often exceeded 10 billion. Huang, blinded by greed, made a wrong decision and committed this shocking case of embezzlement. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, Huang was assigned to collect 7 billion yuan in gasoline payments from the Civil Air Transport, headed by General Chennault. At that time, seeing that the check from the Jin Cheng Bank (dated January 31st) had no payee written on it, he believed

it was a rare opportunity. He took the check to the China National Aviation Corporation and falsely told the company's accountant, Gu Daqian, that he had been entrusted by a relative or friend to ask him to find a way to convert it into interest-bearing deposits. Gu

was friendly with Huang and did not suspect anything. However, he said that such a large sum of money might be difficult to convert all at once and rescheduled the decision for the afternoon. When the time came, Gu only converted 2 billion, and when he intended to issue a check from the Bank of Communications for the remaining amount, Huang claimed that future conversions might be inconvenient and asked him to divide it into 25 checks, each with a face value of 200 million yuan. The next day (the 3rd), Huang used the checks to

exchange some for cash at the Bank of Communications. After exchanging the remaining amount for bank drafts from the same bank, he went to the Wing On Company and selected six expensive wristwatches and five Parker pens. At the International Jewelry Company, he selected four high-quality diamond rings, each weighing over two carats. He also bought 1,000 US dollars on the black market. At the same time, Huang was preparing to flee to Hong Kong. To avoid the attention of the police authorities, he planned to take a ship from Shanghai to Hankou and then travel south along the Yuehan Railway to Hong Kong. Therefore, on the morning of the 4th, he went to the Shenchang Watch Company on Nanjing East Road to continue buying

four expensive wristwatches, paying for all of them with bank drafts from the Bank of Communications. However, the company's staff, for caution's sake, required that the goods be delivered only after the check funds were received in the afternoon. Huang agreed and left. At that time, when Shi Hengsi, the chief accountant of the American Petroleum Company, was reviewing the account books on the 4th, he discovered that the payment from the Civil Air Transport had not been entered. He then inquired further. To his surprise, Huang had not been to the office for two days. After contacting Chennault by phone, he learned that the payment had been made on the morning of the 2nd. He immediately reported to the Police Department and asked Chennault to notify Jin Cheng Bank to

stop payment on the check. After Jin Cheng Bank found out that the check had been presented for exchange by the Bank of Communications that day, it notified the Bank of Communications to stop payment. Then, the Bank of Communications notified Gu Daqian. At that time, a staff member from Shenchang Watch Company was going to cash the check, so the Bank of Communications immediately notified the police. Since the police had received a report from the American Petroleum Company, they had dispatched Chief Tao and his officers to investigate in all directions. At this point, they rushed to investigate and learned that Huang would go to Shenchang Company in the afternoon to pick up the watches. So they

remained calm and waited at the company. When Huang arrived in the afternoon, they arrested him and took him to the station for interrogation, where he confessed to the previous events. After being arrested, Huang was calm and even said, "Man proposes, God disposes." Most of the stolen funds have now been recovered by the police, and the case is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial today.

### Spring Arrives at Jin Cheng

[Our Newspaper's Lanzhou 15th Dispatch] The Chinese people cannot forget the Lunar New Year. This is especially true in the Northwest region. The farmers' festivals in Qinghai and Ningxia provinces have already been held on the 5th of this month, and it is said that they were very grand. However, the farmers' festival in this province will be held on the Lantern Festival, allowing farmers who have worked hard all year round to have a truly happy holiday of their own. Recently, the towns and villages have been busy preparing for the celebration of the farmers' festival—the community fire—the cost of which is expected to be huge, but allowing the public to vent their suppressed emotions in the booming drums and all the indulgent sights and sounds is also a virtuous policy that conforms to public sentiment.

The newspaper industry in Lanzhou did not take a holiday for the New Year. Instead, they took a "rest" in the old year, a full four days. They only started working on the fourth day of the New Year. During the four days without newspapers, everyone was like a blind person, unable to know what was happening in the battle situation in Shenyang. Some people borrowed radios from stores to listen to the broadcast, but the power went out before they could turn it on. The Lanzhou Power Plant initially announced that it would cut off power in different areas every three days, which meant that there would be electricity for three days out of four. However, the power plant could not fulfill its promise. Today, it announced that it would only supply power to different areas once every three days, so there would only be electricity for one day out of four. Today, a reporter was talking to several friends about the electricity in Lanzhou. It is said that the existing five generators can only generate more than 970 kilowatts of electricity. To supply electricity to 4,000 households and 80 factories, which exceeds its capacity four times, it has long been unable to bear the load. In the past six months, the trend of stealing electricity has been particularly prevalent. There are quite a few people using transformers. The power plant does not dare to investigate, and even if they find out, there is nothing they can do. How can the lights be turned on? Now that the New Year has just begun, those who are idle and those who have money are playing mahjong all night long, or playing cards until midnight. How can they not change from "stopping" once every three days to "supplying" once every three days? Another reason is that the source of light and heat in Lanzhou, the Agan Town Coal Mine, was closed for 40 days during the Lunar New Year, and the coal supply has been temporarily cut off. The power plant has not been able to purchase and store enough coal for one and a half months (about 1,000 tons), so it has to blame the machines and use it as an excuse to stop power supply. The new power generating equipment has only been shipped halfway and is still delayed on the way. The other half is still in Shanghai. If the transportation cost of these machines (about 20 billion yuan) cannot be obtained, the entire city of Lanzhou will be plunged into the abyss of darkness!

In the situation of dim lighting, everyone's mood is particularly bad.

Unfortunate events occur frequently. At around 4 p.m. on the 10th, Li Chengbi, a physics and chemistry teacher at the Lanzhou University Affiliated Middle School, was assassinated. A bullet entered from under his right rib and exited through his back. At that time, the sound of firecrackers was constant, so it did not attract attention, and the murderer has calmly escaped. At around 3 p.m. on the 12th, Liang Junshu and Liang Chengyu in Lin Sen Road quarreled and cursed each other, which eventually led to Liang Chengyu hitting Liang Junshu with a stick. The next morning, he died from his injuries. On the night of the 12th, a young man, Ma Bocheng (19 years old), was scolded by his father for returning home late after watching a play. Unexpectedly, he hanged himself. Zhang Shurong and Zhang Delin, who were injured in a gunpowder explosion caused by making firecrackers on January 31st of this year, also died one after another on the 13th. Before noon on the 14th, a young woman jumped into the icy Yellow River to commit suicide due to a family dispute, and there was no way to save her. This series of murder and social news, if they don't come, they don't come, but if they come, they don't stop, like the fires in the last month. During the Spring Festival, civil servants work on a

shift basis, leaving one or two people on duty. However, these few people on duty rarely fulfill their responsibilities. A certain leader sits in a public car and pays New Year visits from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day from the first to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, consuming more than 10 gallons of public gasoline every day. Except for transportation vehicles, postal and telecommunications services are all on a shift basis, and there is no efficiency to speak of. On the other hand, entertainment venues are even more lively, and queuing to grab tickets is a rare and wonderful performance. The ice skating competition at Lan Garden on the first and second days of the Lunar New Year also attracted tens of thousands of viewers. Poor people received winter relief funds of over 100,000 yuan, just enough to buy a pound of wheat flour, and spent the year in their caves. The spring breeze has just arrived, the market has not opened, there is no goods in the department store, the price of rice has quietly jumped from 2.5 million to over 3 million, and wheat flour is not willing to lag behind, also jumping from 1 million per 100 kilograms to 1.6 million. Cigarettes, which cannot be without sales for a day, have increased in price by 30%. According to people familiar with the business situation: the market will rise first and then stabilize after opening. As for how much it will rise and then stabilize, this gentleman "looked left and right and spoke of other things." Zhang Zhizhong, the director who stayed in Beijing for five months, suddenly descended from the sky on the 13th. The silver-white "Tianxiong" special plane swept across the azure sky and the white snow-capped mountains, bringing hope and comfort to the welcoming crowd. In the officers' meeting hall, the reporters surrounded the four generals of the Northwest—Zhang Zhizhong, Tao Zhiyue, Guo Jijiao, and Ma Bufang—and took a group photo to commemorate this reunion. As a small article in a newspaper said: "Director Zhang of the Northwest Headquarters has returned, bringing us great excitement and comfort!...Because of him, the Northwest can generate strength and embark on a prosperous road. During the Spring Festival, Director Zhang has returned, which means that 'spring' has come to the Northwest. The Northwest will flourish with the arrival of spring!" The people of the Northwest really hope, hope that Director Zhang is the embodiment of "spring"—(Our Newspaper Reporter Song Binglin)

Zhang Zhizhong, the director of the Northwest Headquarters, returned to his post and took a group photo with visiting reporters.

### Lanzhou Cultural Work Exhibition Postponed to Today

[Our Newspaper's Lanzhou 20th Dispatch] The cultural community liaison meeting hosted by Zhang Zhizhong and the work exhibition of various cultural units of the Headquarters have been postponed to the 21st due to insufficient preparation.

### Wang Yintai Case to Be Retried Soon; Most of the Evidence Sent to Beijing

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing 20th Dispatch] The case of Wang Yintai, the traitor and former chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, has been returned for retrial by the Supreme Court. The Capital High Court has continued to collect evidence from the north to prepare for a retrial. Most of the materials have now been sent from Beiping to Beijing. Once all the investigations are completed, a date for the trial can be set. According to Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, to our reporter: Regarding the matter of the Executive Yuan passing the resolution to expedite the handling of traitor cases, the court has no difficulty in implementing it. There are currently 64 pending major and minor traitor cases. If the Prosecutor's Office does not file any further lawsuits and the Supreme Court does not return any more cases for retrial, it is hoped that all of them can be concluded by the end of April this year. He personally believes that the Executive Yuan's decision to expedite the handling of traitor cases can indeed promote efficiency. However, whether it is appropriate to end the work of punishing traitors by order and restricting the application of Article 80 of the Criminal Law, which limits the statute of limitations, requires considerable research. Note: The most severe penalty for the crime of treason is the death penalty, and the statute of limitations for prosecution is 20 years.

However, all prostitute houses are unwilling to post them and tear them down as soon as the police officers leave.

### Yu County Government to Sell Accumulated Grain

[Our Newspaper's Changshu 19th Dispatch] The price of rice here has suddenly skyrocketed. The black market price of white rice has broken through 2 million yuan per picul. County Magistrate Zhang immediately sent personnel to the market to monitor business. Because the government stipulated a limited price of 1.65 million yuan, but other places frequently reported price increases, all merchants stopped trading and entered a stalemate. Shao Yongbin, Chairman of the Grain Industry Association, in order to maintain the people's food supply, went to the County Government to meet with County Magistrate Zhang to discuss relaxing the limit. After secret discussions, it was decided to raise it to 1.79 million yuan and strictly limit transactions, absolutely not allowing any exceeding of this price, with severe penalties for violators. In addition, the source of supply would be the responsibility of each merchant, and no interruption would be allowed. It is also learned that, in order to maintain people's livelihood and social order, in addition to making every effort to suppress market price fluctuations, the County Government is now planning to sell as much of the county's accumulated grain as possible, in the hope of stabilizing grain prices.

It is heard that an American merchant has already ordered a large number of firecrackers from Guangzhou firecracker merchants.

### Wuxi Businesses Request Exemption from Checking Account Books

[Our Newspaper's Wuxi 19th Dispatch] The Tax Bureau of the county streamlined the collection of business tax. The other day, it sent a large number of people to randomly check the account books of various industries. During the random checks on Beida Street, there was a misunderstanding, and the shops once closed early, which has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the shops that closed on the 19th opened as usual that morning. On that day, the Tax Bureau still sent people to randomly check, but nothing was found. At 3 p.m. on the same day, the County Chamber of Commerce specially convened a meeting of various industries to persuade them to wait for random checks according to the law. All unreported simplified grade registers were to be reported immediately. After the meeting, various industries also convened a joint symposium to exchange opinions. Two points were decided: (1) The business tax for the 36th year has already been paid. How should the business tax for the spring of this year be paid? It was resolved that the County Council had already decided on the number of business taxes in the county budget, and it should be paid according to the determined number. (2) At present, no place in the country has implemented tax assessment by checking accounts. It is inconvenient for Wuxi to be unique. How should this be expressed? It was resolved that the Chamber of Commerce should petition the government to stop random checks, so as not to affect the business market. If this cannot be resolved within a month, it is feared that it will affect the county's finances. Therefore, there is talk of the County Council taking the lead.

[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou 20th Dispatch] The dispute between the Chen and Wu workers in Xiamen over the docks has not yet stopped. Chairman Liu of Fujian Province is very concerned about this. Because Xiamen is a place for international observation, there should never be such feudal barriers.

If necessary, he will open the wharves there and transfer them to unemployed soldiers.

Afterwards, the three families inspected their losses and found that gold rings, jewelry, and other items worth more than 200 million yuan had been stolen, making it an unprecedented major robbery. The police have been notified and are investigating.

### European Travelogue (4)

— Li Hanhun

Visiting the Labor Party

Together with Zhaolun, I visited the Transport House of the Labor Party and spoke with its representatives for almost two hours. Initially, Jufang asked about women's issues: Question: What is the Labor Party's policy towards women? Answer: After the Labor Party came to power, it actively improved its policy towards women. To summarize:

(1) The Labor Party strives to increase and improve employment opportunities for women and the facilities needed by women workers, such as nurseries, canteens, and restrooms. As a result, the number of female workers has now increased by about one million.

(2) Women's wages and benefits were previously lower than those of men, usually about 30% lower, except for doctors and writers. The law now stipulates equal treatment. However, due to the country's economic difficulties, it has not been possible to pay it in full for the time being.

(3) Pregnant women, new mothers, and children under the age of five are provided with special nutrition by the state, such as milk, orange juice, cod liver oil, and vitamins. The mortality rate has already decreased. Vitamins and other nutrients are also provided to children over the age of five, and it is expected that they will all be provided in two years.

(4) The National Insurance Act has been passed by the Parliament and will be implemented next year. At that time, everyone will receive a food allowance of five cents a day, and families with more than one child will receive state subsidies.

(5) The National Medical Service Act will also be implemented next year. Doctors will be state-owned, and all the needs of doctors will be provided by the state. Health service stations will be established everywhere, with several doctors in each station, providing free medical care to the people. The expenses of the service stations will be provided by the factories. Infants will be divided into two groups, before and after the age of four, and will be regularly checked by state doctors.

Question: Do British women prefer family life or social life? What is the average family size?

Answer: Most British women prefer family life, but the poor have to go out to work due to the pressure of life. After the war, young women prefer social work. The government's social service agencies have rotating female workers to assist mothers and patients, but most women are unwilling to take on this job. The average British family has four people, i.e., two husband and wife and two children. Rural or poor families have more people. The birth rate after the war is higher than before the war.

Question: Are educational opportunities for women equal to those for men?

Answer: The British education system requires compulsory primary education from the age of five to eleven and secondary education from the age of eleven to fifteen. Each level can also participate in the matriculation examination through self-study. Passing the matriculation examination allows one to go to school, but the entrance examination to university is quite strict, and not many people can go to university. There are currently 80,000 university students nationwide, and women account for more than 2,500.

The Q&A on women's issues ended here. Jufang left early because she had something to do. I continued to talk to them: Question: Can you tell me about the important measures and effects of the Labor Party after it came to power?

Answer: The ultimate goal of the Labor Party is economic equality, while maintaining political freedom. The biggest weaknesses of capitalism in the past were: one was monopoly, two was inequality, and three was the number of unemployed. The Labor Party's current policy is to address these three weaknesses in order to achieve a national phenomenon of no monopoly, no inequality, and no unemployment. Its important measures are:

(1) Important industries such as coal, electricity, steel, transportation, and banks are all state-owned. Some of them have already been implemented, and some are in preparation.

(2) The implementation of new laws such as the National Insurance Act and the National Doctor Service Act, and the increase in income tax, inheritance tax, etc., make the people's economy more equal and the standard of living gradually improved.

(3) Regarding the people's employment problem, there are new plans and laws. The current unemployment rate is only 2%, and we will further reduce unemployment and even eliminate unemployment.

Question: After the state-owned enterprises, has the efficiency increased or decreased?

Answer: The national output in the most recent year has increased by 5% compared to the previous year, and the coal industry is the most significant. The biggest reason is that workers would rather be employed by the state than by private individuals. In addition, workers can participate in management, which is not only in line with the principle of economic democracy, but also can reasonably increase efficiency.

Question: Since the output is gradually increasing, why is the general standard of living still declining? Is there any concern that this will lead to dissatisfaction among the people and be taken advantage of by the opposition party?

Answer: Because the current goal is to increase the total output, the income is mostly used for equipment and business expansion, and it has not been possible to increase the standard of living for the time being, but it is still being gradually improved. The sugar and food supplies are increasing daily, and we believe that the plan can be completed in 1950. The opposition party is not very clever, and even less can there be any miracles. We firmly believe that the Labor Party will be supported by the people.

Question: Is there any concern that the wealth of the rich will flee the country?

Answer: The government manages it strictly, and the banks are also state-owned, so it is difficult to flee the country. Moreover, the state has not denied private property, and there is no need to flee the country in principle.

Question: Can the Labor Party's current policies achieve the path to true economic equality? Answer: The Labor Party's current policies are to ensure that the people of the whole country have no fear of poverty, no fear of insecurity, and no fear of inequality in the economy. The British are a practical nation. To meet and apply our practical requirements, we are moving in this direction in order to achieve a bloodless social revolution. After the Q&A, the representatives gave me many reference materials. Then I went to their book supply department to buy several reference books. To my surprise, after walking more than two blocks, the old woman who sold the books hurried to catch up, saying that she had miscalculated and overcharged me by two and a half cents. She asked me to wait so that she could go and get it and send it to me, or go back with her to collect it. Because she was afraid that she would not be able to catch up in time when she discovered it, she did not bring it with her. I immediately went back with her to retrieve it, and the old woman apologized repeatedly. Zhaolun laughed and said, "This is why the British are the British."

### Jiangsu Province Incentives for Afforestation of Barren Mountains

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 19th] The Jiangsu Construction Department, to encourage people to engage in afforestation of barren mountains, has established an incentive method, which will be implemented from this year's Arbor Day on March 12th. The main points are: (1) All owners of afforestable barren mountains should afforest them themselves. The completion period is within two years for those with less than 200 mu, within three years for those with less than 500 mu, within four years for those with less than 1,000 mu, and those with more than 1,000 mu must afforest at least 500 mu per year. (2) Public afforestable land, except for those retained by public forest operators, can be contracted by people in need of forests according to law, with the maximum area not exceeding 20 square kilometers. Those who have not started afforestation one year after being approved for contracting will have their contracting rights revoked. (3) Afforestable barren mountains will be exempt from taxes in the afforestation area for 30 years from the start of afforestation. (4) If people engaging in afforestation of barren mountains lack sufficient funds, they may apply to county and city governments to introduce loans from the China Farmers Bank or other financial institutions. (5) People who achieve results in afforestation will be given commendations, medals, bonuses, or material rewards by the provincial government or county governments. (6) County and city governments should include the funds required for incentivizing afforestation of barren mountains in their annual budget.

Rugged Road: A day trip to scenic spots in the suburbs of London, completed. After discussing several important issues with friends, I sat in meditation and developed a strong interest in British history and the current policies of the Labor Party. The following is a passage from the diary at the time, appended here as a conclusion to the impressions of visiting England.

In the mid-Middle Ages, when European countries were still engaged in their cruel religious wars, Great Britain had already begun its royal political reforms; at the beginning of modern times, when European countries were still engaged in their struggles to end feudal remnants, the Kingdom of Great Britain had already begun its industrial revolution. Escaping the scourge of several European wars, accepting the philosophical ideas and scientific inventions of various European countries since the Renaissance, the Anglo-Saxon nation, quietly residing on the three islands, has advanced in politics, economy, and culture in separate directions for seven or eight hundred years. Therefore, since the eighteenth century, the British flag has been planted all over the world, earning the reputation of the "Empire on which the sun never sets" and the "Lord of the Seas." This capitalist British culture has been boasting to the world for as long as two hundred years.

The cycle of rise and fall is a natural principle. When capitalist culture shone brightly in England, flaws were also revealed at the same time. In the mid-to-late nineteenth century, the number of chimneys in England was the highest in the world, but its slums were also famous at the time. In order to resolve labor-capital conflicts, British thinkers proposed several solutions to practical problems. Moderate socialism, Fabianism, and Guild Socialism are all representative of such solutions.

### Wuxian County's Second Phase of Conscription to be Completed by the End of May

[Our Suzhou Dispatch of the 20th] The county's second phase of conscription for the 37th year is about to begin. The number of conscripts to be recruited in the county accounts for about 10% of all men of conscription age. It is heard that this conscription must be completed before the end of May, and half of the recruits must be collected before the end of March. The County Council believes that the township offices did not handle the first phase of conscription properly, and there was a lot of public criticism, so it has decided to convene a symposium of all county councilors on the 22nd to solicit opinions and provide them to the authorities for improvement.

### China Trust Bureau Accelerates the Handling of Enemy Property, Plans to Implement Jewelry Auction, Measures Being Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The China Trust Bureau, in order to accelerate the handling of jewelry and jade in enemy property, has recently drafted a plan for jewelry auction coupons, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval at the beginning of this week and will be implemented after approval. The full text of the draft measures is as follows: "Draft Measures for the Central Trust Bureau to Issue Jewelry Auction Coupons on Behalf of Enemy Property" (1) The Central Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Ministry of Finance, will issue jewelry auction coupons in order to accelerate the handling of jewelry and jade in enemy property.

### Eastern Science Cooperation Office Establishes Office in Shanghai to Assist in Promoting Engineering Education in China

[United Nations Office in Shanghai Dispatch] The Science Department of the League of Nations Educational Organization has dispatched Mr. Schmuder (Czech) to China to establish the Eastern Science Cooperation Office in Nanjing in order to facilitate scientific cooperation with the organization's Far East member states (China and the Philippines). The office has now been established at 671 North Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, and Mr. Schmuder is temporarily serving as the director.

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reached an agreement with the Chinese Ministry of Education and the League of Nations Educational Organization to continue the program through the Eastern Science Cooperation Office, which necessitated the establishment of a separate office in Shanghai. The Shanghai office is now located in the United Nations Building at 106 Huangpu Road (telephone 40070, extensions 27 and 52). The engineering education program includes basic training equipment worth more than US$2 million, which will be distributed to 35 public and private engineering schools in China. These schools are located in 19 cities from Peiping to Guangzhou and currently have approximately 20,000 students. This program will make a significant contribution to educating China's future technicians and participating in China's industrialization. Professor Klever, who was previously responsible for this program at UNRRA, has now joined UNESCO and is in charge of the Shanghai office to continue the program. Mr. Klever previously served as UNRRA's North China Industrial Relief Officer for two years.

Mr. Schmuder is scheduled to depart on the 21st of this month for the Philippines, where he will meet with Mr. Dasgupta, an agricultural advisor from UNESCO's Paris headquarters, who is traveling directly from France to the Philippines to attend the Food and Agriculture Organization's fisheries, nutrition, and rice conference in Baguio, Philippines. Mr. Schmuder will also visit educational and scientific institutions in the Philippines to establish contacts. On his return trip, he will stop in Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou, which is the first step in Mr. Schmuder's comprehensive visit to China's educational centers.

### Ministry of Education Solemnly Declares That No Six Principles Have Been Established for Improving Normal School Education

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The Ministry of Education has implemented three plans for normal school education before and after the war and issued them to various provinces and cities for implementation. Recently, some newspapers have mistakenly published the matters discussed at the meeting of educational and academic groups as the Ministry of Education's "Six Principles for Improving Normal School Education." A spokesperson for the ministry solemnly declared that the ministry has not established such six principles, and there is no proposal for normal school students to serve for ten years.

[Our City Dispatch] The Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating that the report in the Dahua Daily of February 13 from Nanjing, "Ministry of Education Decides on Six Principles for Improving Normal School Education," contains statements such as normal school students must serve in education for at least ten years, etc. The Ministry of Education has made plans to promote the development of national normal school education over the years and has not separately established the above six principles, which does not conform to the facts.

### Ministry of Education Department Meeting Discusses Adjusting the Powers of Various Departments and Sections, Affiliation of Normal Schools to Undergo Changes

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The Ministry of Education has been holding department meetings for several days to discuss and propose amendments to the "Ministry of Education Internal Regulations" in the "Ministry of Education Organization Law." This "Internal Regulations" includes the responsibilities of various departments, offices, and sections of the Ministry of Education. It is heard that the responsibilities of the higher education, secondary education, national education, social education, and frontier education departments and sections will all be adjusted. One of the important points is that the affiliation of normal education will be changed in order to link the training of teachers with the service of schools. That is, the normal colleges under the jurisdiction of the Higher Education Department will be transferred to the Secondary Education Department, and the secondary normal schools under the jurisdiction of the Secondary Education Department will be transferred to the National Education Department. Because graduates of higher normal colleges are secondary school teachers, and graduates of secondary normal schools are national school teachers, this can strengthen the connection. The results of this discussion will be implemented after the minister's approval and after going through the necessary procedures.

### Teacher Appreciation Rice Collected in Changsha City Elementary Schools

Furthermore, team leaders Ye Yunshan and Chen Zhengmiao have made great progress in their skills since traveling to Nanjing and Hangzhou with the Dagong Team.

Chen Yong'an, Zhou Jun, Chen Zuoliang, Zhang Xianlun and others are experienced and have won two consecutive victories since their debut. They also harbor ambitions to win the sub-group championship. However, due to work commitments, the players have neglected practice. Against the young and strong Green Forest, Green Forest has a higher chance of victory.

However, after suffering a crushing defeat in two matches against Enkas recently, they have buried themselves in hard practice. Wang Rongsheng, the main player in Danyang, may arrive on time today. Once they meet Qingbai, a fierce battle is inevitable.

(Qingbai) Cai Yanxiong, Zhang Shaoqing, Zheng Yaoya, Xu Heng, Wang Nanzhen, Tang Baokun, Zhou Dayun, Chen Xianglong, Zhuo Guorong.

(Chenyou) He Zeng, Chuan Qixia, Wang Rongsheng, Wang Bingfu, Shi Jiuquan, Zhang Bingqian, Ji Youkun, Wan Bai, Bao Daohui.

Yarn Prices See Mixed Fluctuations

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened in the morning with higher prices for yarn from the Textile Construction Company, further boosted by the increase in foreign exchange rates, which boosted confidence. Various stalls opened at higher prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn touched the 80 million yuan mark. Later, as the Textile Construction Company suspended quotations again at high prices, the confidence of the industry turned weak, and the closing price fell slightly. However, the result was still an increase of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. Throughout the day, the price of 21-count Double Horse spot yarn was under pressure from sellers, once reaching the 50 million yuan mark. However, due to the large number of those offsetting positions, it remained at the previous day's price of 51.5 million yuan. 16-count and other coarse yarns saw small trading volumes, and the prices of other counts of yarn saw mixed fluctuations.

Cloth Prices Stop Falling and Rebound

Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially opened with a downward trend, as the Textile Construction Company released a large number of cloth pieces, ample funds, tight positions among traders, and retail investors successively cutting losses, while strong players vomited at high prices. However, after 10:00 AM, as foreign exchange rates rose and cotton yarn prices increased again, merchants from the Yangtze River area frequently increased their purchases, and dyeing factories also came to buy. Short positions rose to offset, and the market suddenly became tight, with prices stopping their decline and rebounding. As a result, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths rose by 40,000 to 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Serge also rebounded strongly, and the market sentiment for other cloths also turned firm.

Spot Cotton Prices Trend Upwards

Yesterday's spot cotton market continued to rebound, with a bullish trend. Traders competed to buy, and market prices rose steadily. Cotton merchants and the Yarn Control Association signed agreements to purchase cotton, all requiring physical collateral. Therefore, traders all stored spot goods, resulting in strong buying interest and increased demand in the market. The future market is still expected to rise. 898 bales were traded throughout the day.

Later, confidence strengthened significantly, and the noon closing price rose to 500,000 yuan for the spot price, with the forward price quoted at 6 million yuan. Trading was very quiet in the afternoon, and there were no changes in prices. The final selling price was still quoted at 6 million yuan, 200,000 yuan lower than the final price of the previous day.

Factory prices remained firm yesterday. The transaction price was similar to that of the morning of the previous day. 15 bales of C-grade were traded at a price of 13.5 million yuan. High and low prices of 10 million yuan and 12 million yuan were also seen, but they were all transactions among traders, with virtually no actual sales. Desiccated waste remained stagnant, with no price fluctuations.

Fine Goods Initially Weakened and Then Rose: Results Level with the Previous Day.

This year, Japan will install 3,377,091 spindles, of which 2,908,593 will be put into operation. It is estimated that 1,100,000 pieces of 20-count yarn can be produced, of which 900,000 pieces will be exported. The export destinations are the Dutch East Indies, Siam, India, Afghanistan, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and other countries, which is a major competitor to our country's textile industry.

### Cigarettes and Soap See Lower Prices

Yesterday's cigarette market saw Yongtaihe only distributing White Tin Pack cigarettes to Datonghang, and traders were still buying, with asking prices rising. Later, as traders' positions tightened and short positions were rushed to be sold, prices fell. However, the final prices of both 10-count Great Britain and Old Knife cigarettes continued to rise by 400,000 and 200,000 yuan, respectively, compared to the previous day. Chinese-made strip cigarettes such as Mice and Three Cats saw only small increases, while the rest were stable. However, the prices of American-made Morris and 50-count Capric Three-Five brand cigarettes fell. In the daily necessities soap market, as Gu Ben and Xiang Mao distributed at the same time, traders' positions tightened, and there were very few spot transactions. Only Datonghang had some retail transactions. Asking prices were initially high and then lower. As a result, Gu Ben soap was priced at 3.1 million yuan, a decrease of 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and Arrow Knife soap was 2.97 million yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan. In addition, Xiang Mao, Guanghua, and Beauty soaps all fell by 20,000 to 100,000 yuan.

The sales of Beauty and Phoenix brand matches were still good, with an increase of 100,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands fell by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.

Traders were actively trading kerosene, with high-grade barrel goods priced at 8.3 million yuan, and canned Mobil Asia priced at 956,000 yuan, a good increase of 12,000 yuan.

### Rice Prices Rise Due to Scarce Arrivals Caused by Rain: Unregistered Rice Shops and Bureaus Stop Sales

[Our Report] The rice market saw scarce arrivals due to rain. Registered arrivals in the southern market were 1,371 stone and 8 dou, and only 70 stone in the northern market, including 55 stone of white yuan and 15 stone of dark yuan. Off-market prices continued to rise. The Social Affairs Bureau sold 10,925 stone to 1,698 rice shops in the city market at a price of 1.75 million yuan in the past two days. From today onwards, the Social Affairs Bureau does not intend to supply rice to rice shops without a grain merchant registration license.

Also, it has been reported that rice prices are rising slowly. Fortunately, the continuous supply of rice from the community bureaus can meet market demand, so although prices have risen, they have not risen excessively. Yesterday, a small amount of coarse indica rice opened at 1.95 million yuan plus commission in the southern market. The off-market supply was still small. White japonica rice continued to rise to 2.2 million yuan, thin rice to 2.15 million yuan, and early rice to 2.1 million yuan, each rising by about 50,000 yuan. The community bureaus distributed rice according to the method of the previous day, distributing about 10,950 stone. There was no white yuan rice distributed, and the off-market price reached 2.3 million yuan.

Flour

As the opening price of wheat from small factories has risen to 1.4 million yuan, raw materials have become expensive, and costs have naturally increased. Furthermore, as Wuxi prices are not low, cargo owners are still trying to raise prices, and various flours have risen again. Old Car flour broke through the 1 million yuan mark, reaching 1.02 million yuan. Bingchuan flour also reached the 1 million yuan mark. Red Bee and Jiancheng are hovering around the 1 million yuan mark. Wheat bran rose again by 45,000 yuan. Large bags of wheat bran were once 690,000 yuan, and then 670,000 yuan. Small bags of wheat bran were 450,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Continued to climb to higher peaks. Soybean prices have risen because oil factories and customers are purchasing them, and the retail market on this street is also active. Hankou bean price is 1.4 million yuan, an increase of about 50,000 yuan. Pinghu extra-coarse beans opened as high as 1.8 million yuan, an increase of about 150,000 yuan, due to reduced arrivals. Selected Qing Xilu goods had scarce arrivals and a low price level, but rose sharply by 200,000 yuan yesterday. Corn prices were firm due to Qing gang purchases, rising by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan in the aftermarket. Red sorghum also rose by 100,000 yuan, green beans rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, and a lot was consumed in the street. Tianjin sesame was not purchased, and the market was stable. The Guang gang purchased medium-quality raw peanuts, raising the price by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and high-quality goods rose by more than 100,000 yuan.

Cooking Oil

Initially weak and then rose. The closing price of soybean oil was similar to the previous day, and crude oil rose by 50,000 yuan. The market trend for both was very strong. Initially, as the price had risen too much on the previous day, many recycled goods were released at high prices. Factory soybean oil once fell to 4.68 million yuan. Upon hearing that the price in Wuxi was not low, cargo owners were reluctant to sell, and the price of miscellaneous grains rose. Taking the opportunity, many stores purchased it, and the price rebounded again. Finally, Da Youyu soybean oil reached 4.8 million yuan again. Jilong crude oil initially traded at 5.2 million yuan, and then rose to 5.3 million yuan in the aftermarket, an increase of 50,000 yuan. Initially, there were few transactions in raw sesame oil. Cooked vegetable oil fell by 100,000 yuan. The Tianjin gang did not purchase small Jilong small-car sesame oil, which fell sharply by 250,000 yuan. Soybean cake rose slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

### Taiwan's Textile Industry: The Jute Textile Industry Has a Thicker Foundation - A Chat with Wu Weijing After His On-the-Spot Investigation

[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, flew to Taiwan on February 7th to negotiate the purchase of Taiwan's yellow jute seeds and to inspect the textile industry in the province. He returned to Shanghai on the 19th after completing his official duties. He told our reporter: "Among Taiwan's textile industries, the jute textile industry has a relatively solid foundation. This is because the province's two special products, sugar and rice, require 15 million jute bags annually. The cotton textile equipment was dismantled and moved to Taiwan by the Japanese after the Pacific War. Currently, there are 29,000 yarn spindles, with an actual operating capacity of 104,000 spindles. However, the operating efficiency is only 7,000 spindles. Taiwan Province needs about 50,000 bales of cotton yarn annually. To meet this demand, equipment with 100,000 yarn spindles is required. Therefore, Taiwan Province currently needs 90% of its cotton yarn to be supplied by other provinces. However, Taiwan Province has excellent conditions for establishing cotton mills, such as: (1) Taichung has an exceptionally good climate. (2) Electricity is cheap, at NT$40 per unit. (3) Labor is cheap, with an average monthly wage of NT$15,000 per person. (4) Workers have strict discipline."

Regarding textile raw materials, the annual production of yellow jute is currently 30,000 dan (a unit of weight), ramie is 13,000 dan, and flax production is relatively small. The annual production of cotton is 2,000 dan. The annual production of silk is over 300 zu (a unit). Among the economic values of various textile raw materials, yellow jute is the highest. Therefore, the Taiwan Provincial Government is actively promoting yellow jute. This time, the Textile Construction Company purchased 270 dan of yellow jute seeds in Taiwan and will promote it near Hangzhou.

Regarding textile equipment, there are 21,000 yarn spindles, with an actual operating capacity of 14,000 spindles. There are 2,500 looms, with an actual operating capacity of 500 looms. There are 5,400 jute spindles, with an actual operating capacity of 4,800 spindles. There are 3,400 jute looms, with an actual operating capacity of 2,400 looms. There are 850 woolen spindles, with an actual operating capacity of 200 spindles. There are 25 silk units. There are over 10,000 cotton spinning machines, with 30,000 units in operation.

### Rice Shipped to Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Tian wheel, carrying 55,000 bags of foreign rice from Bangkok, arrived in port yesterday afternoon and is currently unloading at floating piers 13 and 14. The Great American Company's "Zhong Xiong" ship, carrying over 66,700 bags of American rice from San Francisco to Shanghai, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive next Friday, but now it is known that it will arrive earlier. Furthermore, the Shun Hing Foreign Firm's "Peng Jie Fan Er" ship, carrying a large quantity of flour from San Francisco to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to arrive tomorrow, but now it is said that it will be postponed to the 27th.

### National Grain Federation Conference Scheduled to Open Tomorrow

[Report from this newspaper] The first member representative conference of the National Grain Federation has been scheduled to open at 2:00 PM on the 22nd of this month at the Miscellaneous Grain Guild, No. 377, Minguo Road, in this city. The conference schedule is tentatively set for two days. If time is insufficient, it will be extended accordingly. It is reported that Minister of Food Yu Feipeng, Social Affairs Department advisor Lu Jingshi, and Ministry of Economic Affairs representative Ouyang Lun will attend the opening ceremony to provide guidance.

### Wuxi Commodity Prices Skyrocket

[Report from our correspondent in Wuxi, 20th] Commodity prices here continue to skyrocket today, causing a comprehensive price surge. Speculators in the market whisper among themselves, creating an atmosphere of a black market. Rice and grain are scarce due to rain preventing cotton delivery, and demand from merchants is strong, creating a situation of supply falling short of demand. Early trading prices for white japonica rice opened at 2,090,000, rising to 2,140,000; white yuan rice at 2,270,000; sheep indica rice at 873,000; wharf rice at 856,000; yuan rice at 955,000; wheat at 2,750,000; white wheat at 2,800,000; flour at 1,050,000; soybean oil at 5,000,000; cotton yarn at 52,000,000.

New External Stimulus Arises, Chinese Stocks Revolve and Improve. Yesterday, with even more abundant funds in the Chinese stock market, external stimulus emerged at the right time. Prices easily rebounded after falling. With diverging news, major investors adopted short-term tactics. In the midst of this, there was a potential for improvement. In the morning, due to the increase in US loans, but with some sign of industrial loans, the opening was stable, with gains and losses being minor. Yong Yarn opened at prices of 828 yuan and 854 yuan. The exchange rate was high, and transactions for No. 160 and other advances were immediate, and No. 173 and other advances were gradually transacted, rising to 850 yuan and 870 yuan. Transactions for No. 157 and other outflows were immediate, and sales of No. 61 and others were gradually transacted, falling to low prices of 828 yuan and 850 yuan. Off-market interest rates opened low at 1.95 and 2.4, with transactions for No. 189 and other advances being immediate, and No. 331 and other advances being gradually transacted. Shui Yarn rose to 850 yuan and 873 yuan due to renewed off-market stimulus. Sales of No. 157 and others were still immediate, and outflows of No. 12 and others were gradually transacted. Off-market prices were lower than on-market prices, and the midday closing was at 841 yuan and 867 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, domestically produced stocks, including China Goods, China Textile, Match, Li An, and New China, were flat. Yong Yarn, Zhabei, Rongfeng, America Asia, Huafeng, New Light, Yong Gong, Jingfu, Quanxing, and Underwear saw slight increases, while the rest saw slight decreases. Deferred delivery stocks, Xinnuo were still flat, with the remainder seeing slight increases.

The after-market did not require two days of interest payment. Yong Yarn rose to 850 yuan and 874 yuan. Although No. 152 sold to 848 yuan and 863 yuan, No. 157 and others advanced, especially No. 213, which bought the most. Off-market stimulus strengthened, rising to high prices of 868 yuan and 878 yuan. No. 117 and others sold together, and the national banks saw considerable advances and declines, falling to low prices of 847 yuan and 862 yuan. The northern banks, No. 94 and others, advanced to close at 852 yuan and 863 yuan. Compared to the morning closing, domestically produced stocks Huafeng rose by 0.5%, Yong Yarn, Tongyi, Commerce, Match, Jingfu, Qinxing, Underwear, China France, New China, and Xinnuo saw slight increases, New Light, National Goods, Li An, and Yong Gong were flat, and Zhabei and Rongfeng saw slight decreases. Deferred delivery stocks Huafeng rose by slightly less than 0.5%, Qinxing saw a slight increase, Xinnuo remained flat, and the remainder saw slight decreases. Off-market, unlisted stocks in general, utility stocks were slightly weak, cultural stocks were stable, and the remainder were flat.

### Unified Bonds Mostly Arbitrage Purchases, Foreign Stocks Rise Generally

Yesterday, public bond transactions were mostly arbitrage purchases. Ding and Wu bonds were relatively stable. Unified Class C opened at 80,000 yuan, with a low of 76,000 yuan and a high of 81,000 yuan, before ending with a stalemate. Compared to the previous closing, Classes A, B, and C fell by 2,000 yuan, Ding and Wu were flat, and the trading volume was approximately 2 million yuan. After the exchange rate adjustment, the market listing of foreign stocks and the rise of new outside stimulus, resulted in increased buying and considerable increases in popular stocks. Yish yarn opened in the morning at 730,000, and rose to a new closing high of 820,000. Retail investors provided the supply, and securities dealers and foreign merchants bought in. Compared to the previous closing, telephone stocks had supply failing to meet demand and had the greatest rise. Yish yarn, British Federation, Yish beer, and Steel all rose more than 10%, Jardine Matheson, Yeh Kong, and Paper rose 0.5%, and Tram and Rubber stocks were mediocre.

### Prevent Price Increases, Continue to Tighten Money Supply

The government, seeing commodity prices rise again after the red market, has decided to tighten the money supply to curb this trend. It will continue to adopt the methods of distributing and selling materials to bring legal tender back into circulation. The government agencies in charge of materials have already discussed this carefully and began to take further action on the 19th. Therefore, there has been a large difference in prices in the past few days, amounting to more than 500 billion. It is expected that when the price difference reaches 3 trillion, the money supply will be extremely tight, and commodity prices will fall and stabilize. Materials for distribution include yarn, cloth, sugar, oil, salt, and rayon. Rice and oil will be sold off. The current surge in commodity prices is due to the influx of idle funds from various regions after the New Year, with North China accounting for 70-80%. The idle funds in North China flow in from the Northeast, with North China only serving as a transit point. Shanghai is the final destination for these idle funds, so commodity prices are the first to be affected. The government's tightening of the money supply is only a temporary solution, and it is said that fundamental solutions will be addressed.

### Xi'an Commodity Prices Continue to Rise

[Report from our correspondent in Xi'an, 20th] Under the manipulation of idle funds, commodity prices in Xi'an continue to rise daily, especially for cigarettes and cloth. Yesterday alone, cigarettes rose by 3-4 million per case, and cloth prices also rose from 39 million to 41 million. Judging from the prosperous trading situation in the market, the price surge is likely to continue.

### Bright Prospects for the Tea Market

In recent days, although the color and pattern of red silk tea have been the subject of intense negotiations, the stocks of each type of tea remain scarce, and sellers are holding out for high prices. As a result, both sides are still in a standoff, and the trading environment remains gloomy. However, there is still considerable potential. According to intermediaries, buying interest from Suzhou and surrounding areas has been quite strong recently, especially for mid-range black tea. Overall, the prospects for the tea market seem increasingly bright.

### Tea Association Cables Request for Opening of Tea Loans

The entire board of directors of the China Tea Industry Association, on the 20th, requested the government to expedite the tea loan program, following the example of silk loans, and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, and other relevant authorities, requesting that the price of each dan of tea be set at the standard of exchanging it for three dan of rice. The amount of advance funds for agriculture and commerce should be limited to 10%. It is also requested that half of the prescribed loan limit be allocated to the China Agricultural Loan and the other half to the Central Cooperative Treasury and provincial banks in each province for lending to tea merchants, tea farmers, and tea production cooperatives in various regions. The agencies are also responsible for guaranteeing principal and interest, increasing production, and helping the government promote exports, stabilize people's livelihoods, and curb the source of unrest.

### Official Transfer of Treasury Funds; Receipts Exempt from Stamp Duty

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the question of whether formal receipts for remittances of treasury funds should be affixed with stamp duty, the Direct Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance recently explained that: "Vouchers issued by governments or autonomous agencies at all levels for handling treasury funds or public funds shall be exempt from stamp duty by law. Formal receipts for remittances of treasury funds shall be exempt from stamp tax if the remittance is for the transfer of expenses by various agencies to their subordinates, or for the travel expenses of officials on business trips. However, receipts for the remittance of salaries and benefits to officials on business trips, and for the remittance of procurement fees to direct creditors, shall still be subject to stamp duty in accordance with the law." It is reported that the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank has issued a circular to all branches for compliance.

### Industrial Raw Materials Strengthen

In the market for industrial raw materials, due to the dwindling supply and decreasing inventories, demand is strong from all sides, and market prices are exceptionally strong. Furthermore, due to the increase in the US dollar exchange rate, people are even more anxious. The price of monthly branded soda ash continues to rise by one million yuan, to 63 million yuan per barrel. Purchases of American soda ash by the soap industry are brisk, rising by two million, to 61 million yuan. In addition, small quantities of soda, glycerin, bleaching powder essence, red potassium powder, and zinc oxide powder have also increased by more than 10%.

### Timber Turns Firm

The timber market, which has been sluggish for some time since the New Year, improved yesterday due to exchange rate adjustments, and the market price of fir timber is trending upward.

### Statistics on Deposits in Banks and Financial Institutions for December of Last Year

The National Bank's Audit Department recently released statistics on the total amount of deposits and reserve funds in banks and financial institutions nationwide for December, as follows: Current deposits: 3,883,059,871,542.60 yuan; Time deposits: 635,985,564,691.77 yuan; Total deposits: 4,519,045,436,234.37 yuan; Reserve funds paid in: 640,385,049,591.00 yuan.

Literature and History

### Examination of the Reign Title "Zhenghe" of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty

— Xia Nai

The character "zheng" in the reign title "Zhenghe" of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty is written as 『　』 or 『延』 in the Han bamboo slips excavated from Juyan. Mr. Fu Zhenlun said: Mr. Ma Shuping interpreted it as the character "yan"; Emperor Wu's reign title was originally "Yanhe" (the same "yan" as in Juyan and Yanshou). Later generations transcribed it incorrectly, taking "yan" as "zheng," which has been followed to this day without correction (see "The Yanhe Reign Title of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty," Archaeological Society Journal, Sixth Issue). This new theory is based on new materials and sounds appealing at first. However, after careful examination, it is clear that Mr. Fu's theory is untenable.

Emperor Wu's reign title was originally Zhenghe. The character on the Han bamboo slips is a variant form of the character "zheng." The Zhenghe reign title appears ten times in the Juyan bamboo slips (Mr. Fu claims twelve times. However, bamboo slips No. 534, part 2 and 15, are one slip broken into two pieces, and the characters Zhenghe only appear once. This reign title is not seen in Section 16 of the eighth bamboo slip). These ten characters "zheng" all consist of "zheng" and "chuo." However, sometimes the upper part of the "chuo" character is below the "zheng" character, like Type A in Illustration 1, appearing six times; sometimes it is placed on the right side of the "zheng" character, like Type B in the illustration, appearing four times. As for the characters Juyan, Yuanyan, Yanshou, Yannan, etc., they all appear in the Juyan Han bamboo slips. Especially the two characters Juyan appear together more than three hundred times. I spent several days comparing all 362 occurrences of the character "yan" in Mr. Lao Zhenyi's "Explanations and Interpretations of Juyan Han Bamboo Slips" with the photographs of the original objects (this number may have slight discrepancies; but even if there are one or two omissions, it is not important). The results of the examination show that over 93% of them consist of "yan" and "ノ," like the "usual form" of the "yan" character in Illustration 1; occasionally, the "yin" character is written below the "zhi" character, but this is very rare, only 20 bamboo slips, accounting for 6% of the total; and its first stroke is always oblique, like the "variant form" of the "yan" character in Illustration 1. The side radical of the character "yan" can be written so casually because the characters "chuo," "chi," and "yin" in ancient writing were actually different ways of writing the same character (see Luo Zhenyu's "Interpretation of the Chapter on Xing," in "Collected Works of the Old Man Zhen Song," Series A, Hou Dingwu Manuscript). Although they were differentiated in the Han Dynasty, with "yan" consisting of "yin" and "zheng" mostly consisting of "chi" or "chuo," it was not yet very strict. The most important distinction between the characters "zheng" and "yan" is whether the topmost stroke is tilted or horizontal. Most interestingly, in Juyan bamboo slip No. 557-8, "Zhenghe fourth year... Yanshou, the head of the Juyan agricultural post" (Lao's Interpretation, Volume 2, page 70). Although several parts of the original bamboo slip are slightly blurred, the characters "zheng" and "yan" are still very clear. It can be seen that the topmost stroke of the character "zheng" is horizontal, which is different from the slanted first stroke of the character "yan" (see Illustration 2).

Now we will use philology and exegesis to examine this issue. Shuowen Jiezi, the "chuo" radical: Yan, meaning to walk upright, consists of "chuo" and the sound "zheng." Sometimes it consists of "chi," written as zheng (Volume 2). It is known that these two characters are actually two ways of writing the same character. Luo Zhenyu said: For characters consisting of "chi," the ancient writing sometimes added "zhi" below "chi" to form "chuo"; for characters consisting of "chuo," it was also sometimes abbreviated to "chi." Luo also quoted Shuowen and oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions as evidence to show that the two were actually the same character. Xu Shen mistakenly distinguished them, defining "chi" as a small step, resembling the connection of the three parts of a person's leg; defining "chuo" as walking and stopping. This is entirely based on looking at the shape and interpreting the meaning. Looking at the characters in the "chuo" radical, which one has the connotation of "walking and stopping"? (See Luo Zhenyu's "Interpretation of the Chapter on Xing.") Shuowen Jiezi, the "yin" radical, says: Yan, meaning to walk; consists of "yin" and the sound "zheng" (Volume 2). Although Shuowen places this character separately, upon closer examination, it is actually the same character as "zheng" and "yan." As shown in Illustration 1, in the seal script, "yin" and "chi" are very similar. Luo Zhenyu said: The "yin" in the "yin" radical, written in seal script as 个　, did not exist in ancient writing. Only the ancient character "chi" was sometimes written as 　 or 　, which is one character with slightly different ways of writing, not two characters. Luo also cited the "zheng" characters in the Ehou Yufang Ding and Wu Yi Dun bronze inscriptions as evidence, inferring that the "yan" character in the "yin" radical in Shuowen was actually the same character as the "yan" and "zheng" in the "chuo" radical. (See Luo Zhenyu's "Interpretation of the Chapter on Xing.") In Han Dynasty steles, "yan" is also often written as "延," for example, in the Huashan Temple Stele, the Shi Chen Later Stele, and the Wu Gulang Stele. It can be seen that "yin" and "chuo" were actually interchangeable at that time. As for the character "yan" in Juyan, Shuowen places it in the "yan" radical, consisting of "yan" and the sound "ノ," meaning to walk for a long time (Volume 2). The sound is different from the character "zheng" and its variant forms, and the meaning is also different. Later generations probably gradually used the character "zheng" consisting of "chi" exclusively because the variant form of the character "zheng" could easily be confused with the character "yan." As a result, not only was the character "zheng" consisting of "yin" abandoned, but also the character "zheng" consisting of "chuo" was no longer used.

In terms of textual criticism of ancient books, it also helps to solve this problem. In the Book of Han, regarding the Zhenghe reign title, Wang Shaolan said:

"Examining the 'Table of Princes and Kings' in the Book of Han, 'zhenghe' is used five times; in the 'Table of Princes' it is used nine times; in the 'Table of High Officials of Emperor Gao, Empress Gao, Emperor Wen, and Emperor Gong' it is used twice for 'zhenghe' and once for 'yanhe'; in the 'Table of Meritorious Officials of Emperor Jing, Emperor Wu, Emperor Zhao, Emperor Xuan, Emperor Yuan, and Emperor Cheng,' 'yanhe' is used four times (Yan Shigu said 'yan' is also 'zheng'), 'zhenghe' is used eight times, and 'zhenghe' is used once; in the 'Table of Marquises by Grace of Imperial Relatives' 'zhenghe' is used once; in the 'Table of Hundred Officials and Dukes' 'zhenghe' is used twice. The Zhi and Zhuan also all use the character 'zhenghe.'" (Corrections and Supplements to Shuowen Jiezi, Volume 2)

It is not known which version of the Book of Han Mr. Wang based his statement on. In the Beisong Jingyou edition of the Book of Han (in the Hundred-Volume Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories) reprinted by the Commercial Press, all places where Mr. Wang said the character "yan" was used now have the character "yan." In the Qing Dian edition of the Book of Han, only the Pingqu Marquis entry in the "Table of Meritorious Officials of Emperors Jing and Wu" uses the character "yan" consisting of "chuo" because there is a comment below this entry saying "Yan Shigu said 'yan' is also 'zheng.'" The rest of the places are written as "yan" or "zheng." This is because the character "yan" had already fallen out of use when later generations transcribed it, so they were all changed to the character "zheng" for consistency. The Yan Shigu's comment below the Pingqu Marquis entry was retained because if it were also changed to the character "zheng," the comment would become "zheng is also the character zheng," which would not make sense. As for being written as the character "yan," that is due to the similarity in shape leading to error. In the Nanjing Yingzhou Academy edition of the Book of Han reprinted by Jiayetang, almost all the annual tables have been changed to the character "zheng." Only the Pingqu Marquis entry and the subsequent Yagu Marquis entry are written as the character "yan," probably for the same reason. The annual tables are the part of the history book that is relatively easy to overlook, and there is also Shigu's comment, so it was able to preserve this trace. From this, it can be seen that the character "zheng" in Zhenghe in the ancient Book of Han was inconsistent, sometimes consisting of "chi," sometimes consisting of "chuo," and sometimes consisting of "yin." The three were interchangeable in ancient times. The version that Yan Shigu saw had the character "zheng" in the Zhenghe in the Pingqu Marquis entry consisting of "or yin," so the comment said "also the character zheng." Shigu meant to say that the two were interchangeable, not a mistaken character. Later, it was mistakenly written as the character "yan." Now Mr. Fu Zhenlun intends to change Zhenghe to Yanhe. Is he so shocked by the new materials that he has gone astray?

My friend, Mr. Lao Zhenyi, has also noticed this problem, but has not been able to solve it. He said: "The Zhenghe bamboo slips are written as Xia　He, and Mr. Ma Shuping said it is the character 'yan.' Now, according to general usage, it is still written as Zhenghe. After all, there is no need to investigate the original meaning of the naming by the ancients. Writing it as Zhenghe makes it clear at a glance that it is a year of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, which is better than writing it as Yanhe." (Collected Works of the Institute of History and Philology, Tenth Volume, Part 2, "Examination of the Failure to Establish a Reign Title After the Later Yuannian of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty," Note 1) But this is not a matter of convenience, but a matter of factual truth. Therefore, I have spared no effort to conduct a detailed examination.

After the initial draft of this article was completed, Mr. Chen Yuanan came to Beijing. I sought his opinion on it. Mr. Chen said: Ying Shao's commentary on the Zhenghe reign title in the Book of Han says: "It means to conquer the four borders and bring peace to the world." Ying was familiar with the anecdotes of the Former Han Dynasty, and his time was only about two hundred years after Zhenghe, so he should not have misread the character "yan" as the character "zheng." Therefore, when I first heard the new theory of the Yanhe reign title, I was suspicious and dared not believe it. Now that I have seen this examination, I can be thoroughly relieved.

### On the History of the Nanzhao Kingdom

— Xiang Da

—A textual study on the books recording Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty—

(4)

During the Zong Xian Tong period, there was Fan Chuo's "Man Shu" in ten volumes, and Dou Pang's "Yunnan Bielu" in one volume; during the Xi Zong period, there was Xu Yunwen's "Nanzhao Lu" in three volumes, and Lu Xie's "Yunnan Shizhuang" in one volume. Fan Chuo's book review is at the end of this article. Now, let's briefly talk about the books of Dou Pang and others.

The New Tang Book and the Song History Art and Literature Records both recorded Dou Pang's "Yunnan Bielu" in one volume. Dou Pang replaced Li Shiwang as the Dingbian Jiedushi in the tenth year of Xiantong, but he was greedy and lost the hearts of the people. When the Nanzhao people attacked, Pang fled in fear, and in the eleventh year he was demoted to Si Hu of Kangzhou. It is impossible to verify when he wrote "Yunnan Bielu." The "Examination of Different Records" in Zizhi Tongjian, Dezong Zhenyuan tenth year, quoted a passage from Pang's book, saying, "Zhao Yuanzi registered Yimouxun as the Nanzhao, presumably at his request. The name Nanzhao began from this point on." The Cefu Yuangui recorded that in Zhenyuan, the Tang Dynasty bestowed a gold seal and silver socket on Nanzhao, with the inscription "Zhenyuan Registers Zhao Seal." Nanzhao is the same as Nanguo Dazhao. The Southern Zhao Dehua stele records that in the eleventh year of Tianbao, Geluofeng was a northern vassal of Tubo, "at Dengchuan, registering and announcing Zhao as Zanpu Zhongnan Guo Dazhao." Nanzhao is the same as Nanguo Dazhao, and Zhenyuan registering Nanzhao was just following the old name of Tubo.

Since Qiulong succeeded to the throne in the thirteenth year of Dazhong during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, until the fourth year of Qianfu during the reign of Emperor Xizong, there were almost border violations every year for nearly twenty years. In the fourth year of Qianfu, Qiulong died, and his son Fa was established, and the border intrusions gradually decreased. Xin Dang, the Jiedushi of Lingnan Xidao, often exchanged envoys with Nanzhao. In the sixth year of Qianfu, he sent the patrol officer Xu Yunwen to Yunnan. He arrived at Shanshan City (now Kunming) in February, stayed for seventeen days, and then returned. In June of the first year of Guangming, he also served as the deputy Zongzheng Shaoqing to Li Guinian, the king of Sicao, and sent him to Nanzhao. He did not return to Xichuan until August of the first year of Zhonghe. Yunwen went to Nanzhao twice in three years. His "Nanzhao Lu" in three volumes, as seen in the Tang and Song Art and Literature Records, was probably a summary of his experiences and observations from his two missions. "Nanzhao Lu" was not passed down after the Song Dynasty. The "Examination of Different Records" in the Tang History of Zizhi Tongjian, Emperor Xizong Qianfu fourth year, February, quoted this book, saying, "Nanzhao's other name is Hetuo, and later it also called itself Dafengren." The fact that the Nanzhao state name was also Hetuo or Dafengren was first seen in this book. The explanations of Hetuo and Dafengren are unknown. Mr. Fang Guoyu believed that Hetuo was the transliteration of 　馱羅. He speculated from the 　 rhyme study, which was too much of a detour, and we were a little unsure whether to believe it.

The book "Yunnan Shizhuang" in one volume was written at the same time as Xu Yunwen's "Nanzhao Lu" and is found in the Song History Art and Literature Records. The "Examination of Different Records" in the Tang History of Zizhi Tongjian, Emperor Xizong Guangming first year, May, Zhao Zongzheng returned to Nanzhao, quoted "Yunnan Shizhuang" to correct the date of the Xichuan Jiedushi Chen Jingxuan's mission to Nanzhao, as well as the reasons why Feng You and others gradually became disrespectful. It also said that "Yunnan Shizhuang" did not record the letters between Chen Jingxuan and Yunnan, sometimes calling it Hetuo, and sometimes calling it Dafengren. The Nanzhao state name was first recorded in "Nanzhao Lu" and "Yunnan Shizhuang," so the name Hetuo or Dafengren may have originated during the time of Emperor Xizong. The Song History did not state who wrote "Yunnan Shizhuang." Wen Gong's "Examination of Different Records" believed that it "seems to be Lu Xie's memorial draft." Xie was the prime minister during the time of Emperor Xizong, and Xin Dang and Chen Jingxuan's sending envoys to Nanzhao to allow him to make peace, Xie's claim was the most. Wen Gong said that "Shizhuang" was Xie's memorial draft, which may be true.

The relationship between Nanzhao and the Tang Dynasty was the most complicated during the time of Emperor Yizong. There were almost annual border alerts, especially in the southern part of China, such as Annam and Yongguan. During the Chengtong period, Annam was captured by Nanzhao, and Yongguan was in turmoil. Therefore, troops from the southeast were transferred to garrison Guilin. Eventually, Pang Xun rebelled, which led to the demise of the Tang Dynasty. Therefore, the gains and losses of Annam were of great importance to the Tang Dynasty. Fan Chuo was a person who personally experienced the Nan Zhao attack on Annam. The "Man Shu" he wrote was all materials collected in Annam, and he compiled it in a systematic way. After Huayang Guozhi, the oldest and best existing record of the history and geography of the southwest is Fan Chuo's book.

Fan Chuo's book, as recorded in the New Tang Book and the Song History Art and Literature Records, consists of ten volumes. Fan's origin cannot be verified, and he was an assistant to Cai Xi, the Annam Economic Envoy. In the third year of Xiantong, Xi was ordered to manage Annam. In the winter of that year, Nanzhao launched a large-scale attack, and in the spring of the fourth year, Annam fell. Xi's family died seventy people, and Chuo escaped across the river. The writing of "Man Shu" probably began in Annam, after Cai Xi's failure. Therefore, the last part of the tenth volume of "Man Shu" says:

"Your two officials have recorded the Man border routes, mountains, rivers, cities, towns, the beginning and end of the six Zhao states, the names of various tribes, customs and laws, local products, the names of the six Jian states, and the neighboring tribes, all compiled into ten volumes on January 29th of last year. They were presented at the Jiangkou of Annam Prefecture, attached to Zhang Shouzhong, the Yaya of Xiangzhou." This was probably in the fourth year of Xiantong. In the fifth year of Xiantong, Fan Chuo was appointed Changshi of Kuizhou Dudufu. He reorganized "Man Shu" once again. At the end of the tenth volume of "Man Shu", there is a discussion about the Miao people in the four towns of Qianjing, Ba Xia. (To be continued)

### Shen Jianshi and Recent Historical Studies

— Zhou Zumo

Mr. Shen Jianshi passed away on August 2nd of last year, and all who heard of it were deeply saddened. Throughout his life, Mr. Shen devoted himself to academic pursuits, bringing forth the new from the old. His contributions to the development of historical studies in the past two decades were immense and deserve to be recounted. I will discuss this in three aspects:

1.  Organizing the Ming and Qing Archives

The most common difficulties encountered in historical research are fourfold: first, lack of documentary evidence; second, conflicting records; third, divergent legends; and fourth, scattered materials. To overcome these four difficulties, one must first find authentic and abundant historical materials. Only with authentic and abundant materials can new discoveries be made. For example, the official documents of the Qing Dynasty for over two hundred years are excellent resources for studying modern history. However, since the founding of the Republic of China, no one had paid attention to them. In the second year of the Republic (1913), the Ministry of Education established the Historical Museum, which stored archives moved from the Grand Secretariat's warehouse during the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty. However, they were locked away and forgotten by the world after a few years. In the tenth year of the Republic (1921), they were suddenly sold to a paper mill for papermaking. Luo Zhenyu learned of this and spent over ten thousand yuan the following year to buy them back, thus saving them from destruction (as detailed in Wang Jing'an's "Record of the Library in the Warehouse"). In the same year, Peking University had established the Institute of Chinese Studies. President Cai Yuanpei hired Mr. Shen as the director. Mr. Shen, moved by Luo's efforts to purchase the archives, requested Mr. Cai to petition the Ministry of Education to transfer the remaining archives to the Institute for organization. Permission was granted in May of that year, and the transfer began in July. A total of sixty-two wooden crates and one thousand five hundred and two burlap sacks were transported. These included memorials, reimbursement records, proclamations, congratulatory presentations, tribute lists, and submitted essays from the Ming to Qing dynasties, as well as imperial edicts, transcripts, the list of successful candidates in the imperial examination, daily records of the emperor's activities, veritable records, and historical drafts. Consequently, the Ming and Qing Historical Materials Organization Committee was established to begin organizing them. This marked the beginning of academic institutions researching archives. Mr. Shen presided over this effort for several years, and several individuals assisted him. In addition to categorizing and separating the materials by dynasty, compilations were made, such as the "Abstract Compilation of Memorials from the Ministry of War in the Late Ming Dynasty," the "Daily Records of Reimbursement Records from the Nine Reigns of the Qing Dynasty in the Capital and Provinces," and the "Manual of Official Seals of the Qing Dynasty." Among these were valuable historical materials, such as the drafts of the "Veritable Records of Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty," the drafts of the "Veritable Records of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty," and fragments of Ming historical materials, as well as the drafts of the "Sacred Instructions of Emperor Taizong of the Qing Dynasty," all of which were sufficient to supplement omissions in official books and correct errors in official histories.

The archives collected by Peking University were all from the outer court's Grand Secretariat warehouse. The archives from the inner court and palaces of the Qing Dynasty remained in the Forbidden City. In the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), when Puyi was expelled from the palace, the government organized the Qing Imperial Family Aftermath Committee to take over the Forbidden City with personnel from the Ministry of Interior and local government offices to inventory the palace's items. Mr. Shen, along with Mr. Chen Yuan'an, Mr. Li Shizeng, and others, served as committee members. The following year, the Palace Museum was established in October, with two departments: Antiquities and Books. The Library was further divided into the Books and Documents departments, with Mr. Shen presiding over the Documents department. As a result, he concentrated his efforts on organizing the palace archives, opening exhibition rooms in the outer east section to display abstracts. Later, the old archives from the Imperial Clan Court, the Grand Council, and the Qing History Compiling Office were also received and organized in sequence. In the eighteenth year (1929), the Palace Museum was reorganized in February, establishing three departments: Antiquities, Books, and Documents. Mr. Zhang Puquan was appointed director of the Documents department, with Mr. Shen as his deputy. At this time, in addition to categorizing and cataloging the archives, key items were selected and published as "Dang Gu Cong Bian," which was later renamed "Wen Xian Cong Bian." Materials of similar nature were compiled into special publications and printed separately, such as the "Materials on the Three Feudatories" and the "Archives of Literary Inquisitions." Of particular importance were the "Diplomatic Historical Materials of the Jiaqing Reign," the "Diplomatic Historical Materials of the Daoguang Reign," the "Historical Materials of Sino-Japanese Negotiations of the Guangxu Reign," the "Historical Materials of Sino-French Negotiations," and the "Diplomatic Historical Materials of Sino-Japanese Relations of the Xuantong Reign."

After the fifteenth year, the archives in the museum were divided into four categories: palace archives, archives of the Imperial Household Department, archives of the Grand Secretariat's warehouse, and archives of the Grand Council. In September of the eighteenth year, the old archives of the Ministry of Justice were also received. In the spring of the twentieth year (1931), the East and West Warehouses were reorganized, and the full extent of these ancient documents, locked away for over two hundred years, became known to the world. In July of the twenty-third year (1934), Mr. Ma Shuping became the director of the Palace Museum, and Mr. Shen served as the director of the Documents department. He believed that the previous organization methods still had shortcomings:

(1) Too much emphasis was placed on form, focusing only on distinguishing objects and arranging them chronologically, while neglecting the content of the archives.

(2) Attention was only paid to the archives themselves, neglecting the research on the functions of government offices and document procedures, resulting in the loss of connection between various types of archives.

(3) Too much emphasis was placed on searching for valuable historical materials, while neglecting the general organization of numerous ordinary materials.

Therefore, a new plan was proposed to eliminate the old problems, focusing all efforts on general organization. The archives stored in various places were cross-referenced, and attention was paid to exploring the historical evolution of the archives. The existing historical materials were divided into several groups, first categorized by name, and then cataloged by category. Detailed rules were formulated, abandoning the old parallel classification method and creating a systematic classification method (as detailed in Mr. Shen's "Report on the Organization of Archives in the Documents Department of the Palace Museum" in the twenty-fourth year). At that time, in addition to compiling and printing various historical materials, catalogs of the Grand Council archives, compilations of old archives stored in the Grand Secretariat's warehouse, and general catalogs of memorials not recorded in the "Yongzheng Emperor's Vermilion Endorsements," as well as illustrated catalogs of the Imperial Household Department's Office of Manufacturing and Mapping Room, were published to facilitate scholars' research.

2.  Promoting Archaeology

The study of ancient artifacts began in the Song Dynasty but later declined. It was not until the emergence of Ruan Yuan, Wu Qingqing, and others in the Qing Dynasty that this lost learning was greatly revived. Their diligence in collecting and their precision in appraisal almost surpassed the people of the Song Dynasty. However, they focused on determining the age of individual artifacts and examining inscriptions, lacking comprehensive research. They did not follow the Song scholars' practice of using ancient artifacts to elucidate rituals and using ancient scripts to correct books.

By the years of the Republic, only a few people were engaged in this field. Although countless ancient artifacts were unearthed daily, only Luo Zhenyu collected and disseminated them. However, archaeologists studying ancient artifacts must not only know their shapes and understand their times but also know their excavation sites, excavation circumstances, and all related information. Therefore, it is important to conduct on-site investigations and carry out planned excavations using scientific methods. For this reason, the Institute of Chinese Studies at Peking University established an Archaeological Research Office in May of the twelfth year of the Republic, and also established an Ancient Sites and Artifacts Investigation Committee to implement investigations and prepare for excavation and preservation. The scope of investigation was divided into three categories: ancient sites, ancient artifacts, and ancient works of art. The methods of investigation were divided into five categories: photography, rubbing, modeling, drawing, and recording. In August of that year, many Zhou Dynasty bronzes were unearthed in Xin Zheng and Meng Jin counties of Henan Province. Mr. Ma Shuping was invited to investigate and brought back rubbings and photographs. More than six hundred bronzes and cart decorations unearthed in Meng Jin were purchased. Later, Xu Xusheng, Li Xuanbo, Chen Wanli, and Xu Sheng also participated in the investigation of ancient sites and artifacts. The investigations of the Ming Dynasty relics on Da Gong Mountain, the ancient artifacts unearthed in the Bei Mang Mountain in Luoyang, and the ancient sites in Dunhuang, Gansu, made significant contributions to archaeology. By the sixteenth year, the collected antiquities, including metal and stone inscriptions, oracle bones, and pottery, amounted to more than four thousand pieces, along with fifty-seven Yuan Dynasty murals from Xinghua Temple in Ji Shan, Shanxi, and more than twelve thousand kinds of rubbings of metal and stone inscriptions (see the "Outline of the Institute of Chinese Studies" in February of the sixteenth year).

3.  Paying Attention to the Investigation of Ballads and Customs

In December of the ninth year of the Republic (1920), Peking University established the Ballad Research Association, which was incorporated into the Institute of Chinese Studies in the eleventh year. Approximately fourteen thousand ballads were collected before and after, and the "Ballad Weekly" was published, compiling ballads by province, totaling ninety-six issues. Several ballad series were also published. In May of the twelfth year of the Republic, the Customs Investigation Committee was established. The methods of investigation included written records and the collection of physical objects. The materials obtained were published in the "Ballad Weekly" and the "Weekly of the Institute of Chinese Studies" in the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925).

From the above three aspects, it is clear that although Mr. Shen's specialized field was not history, his contribution to promoting the atmosphere of academic research cannot be ignored. Mr. Shen once said: "The atmosphere of Peking University's research on Chinese studies has undergone three changes: initially, it followed the remaining habits of the late Qing Dynasty, emphasizing ancient prose; after three or four years, it advocated philology; around the tenth year, it gradually leaned toward science, increasingly moving towards the use of empirical methods. It was believed that the shortcomings of scholars in the past who completely believed in books should be corrected. Therefore, the Institute of Chinese Studies promoted archaeology in ancient research, focusing on the collection of ancient artifacts; in modern research, it focused on government archives and folk customs. Holding these two major new sources of information, it supported the research of books, opening up a new path for scholars." (See the preface to the "Compilation of Old Archives Stored in the Qing Cabinet" that he wrote) This also shows the depth of Mr. Shen's planning and consideration.

Examining the development of historical studies in the past twenty years, it relied on two things: one was the method of scientific empiricism, and the other was the discovery of new historical materials. The method of scientific empiricism was advocated by Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Hu Shih, becoming a new trend of thought since the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic; the discovery of new historical materials was largely due to the help of archaeologists. Mr. Shen was a radical figure of the May Fourth era and the strongest advocate of archaeology. Therefore, he had a driving force in the progress of historical studies.

### Several Questions Regarding "The Categories of Poets"

— Xiang Changqing

Regarding the collation of "The Categories of Poets," if we base it on the "Four Series Complete Collection," the "Xue Jin Tao Yuan" edition, and the "School Edition," we can see at least the following questions:

First, the number of authors listed. The preface to "The Categories of Poets" says:

"Rong has only recorded five-character poems. Although the net encompasses the past and present, and the words and texts are almost complete, I lightly wish to distinguish clearly between the pure and the impure, picking out the faults and advantages, totaling one hundred and twenty people. Those who participate in this lineage may be called talented scholars."

The summary of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" says:

"Rong was well-versed in the Book of Changes and excelled in writing. He categorized ancient and modern five-character poems, from the Han and Wei dynasties to the present, totaling one hundred and three people, discussing their strengths and weaknesses, dividing them into upper, middle, and lower categories." It also says:

"Among the one hundred and three people, only Wang Rong is called Wang Yuanchang without mentioning his given name."

According to "The Categories of Poets," the number of people listed is one hundred and twenty. However, in Zijiang Yu's poem, it says, "My brother's sacrifice is not to be missed." And in Zhang Xintai's poem, it says, "Xintai and his son Zhen are superior to Xigu in writing." Therefore, the actual number of people commented on should be one hundred and twenty-two. The statement in the summary of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" is of unknown origin.

Second, in the middle category, there is Ying Qu, a Wei Attendant, and in the lower category, there is also Ying Qu, a Jin Literary Figure. In my humble opinion, the Jin Literary Figure Ying Qu in the lower category is actually a mistake for Ying Chang, a Wei Literary Figure. The "Wei Zhi" says:

"Ying Chang, whose courtesy name was Delian, was from Runan. Emperor Taizu summoned him to serve as an aide in the Prime Minister's office and later as a Literary Figure for the General of the Five Offices. He died." (According to the "Wen Xuan" citation)

From this, it can be seen that the Literary Figure Ying Qu should be Ying Chang. The "Wen Xuan" records a poem from his collection "Ji on the Jianzhang Terrace" when he was an Attendant of the General of the Five Offices. Some may suspect that Ying Qu should be Ying Zhen because Zhen was a Jin person. However, an examination of Yu Zhongrong's "Articles of Literature" says:

"Ying Zhen, whose courtesy name was Jifu, was famous for his talent from a young age and was capable of discussion. Emperor Wu of Jin appointed him as a military advisor when he was General of Pacification. After the Jin Dynasty ascended to the throne, he was promoted to be a Gentleman of the Crown Prince's Household and a Palace Attendant."

Ying Chang once served as a Literary Figure of the General of the Five Offices, while Ying Zhen served as a military advisor to the General of Pacification, a Gentleman of the Crown Prince's Household, and a Palace Attendant. It can be seen that the so-called Literary Figure Ying Qu should be Ying Chang and definitely not Ying Zhen. The characters "Chang" and "Qu" both have the radical "jade" and are easily mistaken, while the characters "Zhen" and "Qu" are very different. Some may say that the arrangement of "The Categories of Poets" is in chronological order. The original order is Ruan Yu, a Wei Clerk; Ouyang Jian, the Governor of Dunqiu in Jin; Ying Qu, a Jin Literary Figure; Ji Han, the Secretary of the Jin Imperial Secretariat; Ruan Kan, the Governor of Henan in Jin; Ji Shao, an Attendant of Jin; and Zao Ju, a Jin Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. It seems that after Ouyang Jian, the Governor of Dunqiu in Jin, there should not be the title of a Wei Literary Figure Ying Chang. However, this statement cannot be completely trusted. Generally speaking, the order is chronological. But there are a few exceptions in the middle. For example, in the middle category, after Emperor Wen of Wei, there is Ji Kang, a Jin Middle Gentleman; Zhang Hua, the Minister of Works of Jin; followed by He Yan, a Wei Gentleman; Sun Chu, the Governor of Fenyii in Jin; Wang Zan, a Jin Author; Zhang Han, a Clerk of the Jin Minister of Works (according to the records, "minister of works" is extraneous); Pan Ni, a Secretary of the Jin Imperial Secretariat; but after that, there is Ying Qu, a Wei Attendant. It can be seen that it is not impossible to have the title of a Wei Literary Figure Ying Chang after Ouyang Jian, the Governor of Dunqiu in Jin. This may be due to Zhong Rong's negligence, or it may be due to errors in copying over one or two thousand years, resulting in this irregular phenomenon. I believe that Wei being mistaken for Jin, and Chang being mistaken for Qu, are both very possible. However, the title of Literary Figure would definitely not be confused with things like military advisor to the General of Pacification, Gentleman of the Crown Prince's Household, or Palace Attendant. Moreover, the "Wen Xuan" only records one poem by Ying Zhen, "Collection of the Emperor Wu of Jin in the Hualin Garden," which is a four-character poem and not within the scope of Zhong Rong's discussion. This further illustrates that the Literary Figure Ying Qu is definitely not Ying Zhen.

Third, the summary of the "Four Series Complete Collection" says:

"History says that Rong once sought praise from Shen Yue, but Yue did not give it to him. Therefore, Rong resented him and listed Yue in the middle category. According to the records, Yue's poems are listed in the middle category, which is not considered suppression. However, in the preface, he deeply criticized the study of prosody, saying that 'wasp waists and crane knees' and 'I am not good at it,' and 'double alliteration and repeated rhymes' and 'the common people already have it.' It is clear that he is attacking Yue's theories, which is not entirely without reason." An examination of the preface to the lower category of "The Categories of Poets" says:

"I believe that literary works must be recited and read, and should not be hindered. But now, the pure and the impure flow together, and the pronunciation is harmonious and smooth, which is sufficient. As for level, rising, departing, and entering tones, I am not good at it. Wasp waists and crane knees, the common people already have it." I don't understand why the original text, "As for level, rising, departing, and entering tones, I am not good at it. Wasp waists and crane knees, the common people already have it," was quoted by the scholars of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" as "Wasp waists and crane knees, I am not good at it, double alliteration and repeated rhymes, the common people already have it!" And it is said that "It is clear that he is attacking Yue's theories." This is also difficult to understand. The preface to "The Categories of Poets" says: "Wang Yuanchang initiated it, and Shen Yue and Xie Tiao amplified its waves." It is clear that the main target is Wang Rong, and Shen Yue and Xie Tiao are just amplifying the waves. Shen Yue's poems were listed in the middle category by Rong. The summary says: "Each category is preceded by a preface." But the so-called attack is in the preface to the lower category, which shows that Shen Yue and Xie Tiao were only mentioned incidentally. As for the historical claim that Rong once sought praise from Shen Yue, but Yue did not give it to him, so Rong resented him and listed Shen Yue in the middle category, this has been discussed extensively in the second chapter and does not need to be repeated.

Fourth, the summary of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" also says:

"Among the one hundred and three people, only Wang Rong is called Wang Yuanchang without mentioning his given name. Some suspect that he was showing him private respect. However, Xu Ling's 'New Songs from the Jade Terrace' also only mentions Rong's courtesy name. It is likely that during the Qi and Liang dynasties, people avoided the personal name of Emperor He of Qi, so they used the courtesy name. There is no other reason. Now, we will retain the original text to preserve its original state."

According to "The Categories of Poets," the term Yuanchang appears three times: the first time it says, "Recently, Ren Fang and Wang Yuanchang and others did not value the strangeness of words but competed for new events." The second time it says: "In the Qi dynasty, there was Wang Yuanchang." The third time it says: "Wang Yuanchang initiated it." But in the individual discussion, it is still "Wang Rong, General of Ning Shuo of Qi," not Wang Yuanchang. It can be seen that the personal name and courtesy name are used together. There are many examples of using the personal name and courtesy name together, such as in Yan Yi's general discussion, "Xie Ke was the hero of the Yuanjia era, and Yan Yannian was his assistant." But the individual discussion is "Yan Yanzhi, Guanglu Grand Master of Song," which originated from Lu Ji. Yanzhi is the personal name, and Yannian is the courtesy name. Also, the general discussion says, "First, Guo Jingchun used his literary strength to create his style, and Liu Yueshi relied on his pure and firm spirit to achieve its beauty together." Also, it says, "Yueshi was moved by the chaos, and Jingchun chanted about immortals." But the individual discussion is Liu Kun, the Grand Commandant of Jin, and Guo Pu, the Governor of Guinong in Jin. Also, the general discussion says, "Xie Yishou continued to write, flourishingly." The individual discussion is Xie Hun, the Imperial Secretariat Director. In addition, Wang Can, Zhongxuan, Liu Zhen, Gonggan, Pan Yue, Anren, Zhang Xie, Jingyang, Ji Kang, Shuye, Zhang Hua, Maoxian, Liu Hui, Shizhang, He Yan, Pingshu, Lu Ji, Shiheng, Zuo Si, Taichong, Zhang Han, Jiying, Yuan Hong, Yanbo, Bao Zhao, Mingyuan, Jiang Yan, Wentong, Ren Fang, Yansheng, Shen Yue, Xiuming, Ban Gu, Mengjian, Zhao Yi, Wensheng, Xu Gan, Weichang, Ruan Yu, Yuanyu, Ouyang Jian, Jianshi, are countless examples. How can it be said that Wang Rong is the only one called Wang Yuanchang without mentioning his given name, and therefore he was showing him private respect? Moreover, the preface to "The Categories of Poets" attacks Wang Rong's theory of prosody so thoroughly. How can it be possible to talk about showing him private respect? If one could carefully read through "The Categories of Poets," one would know that the use of personal names and courtesy names is quite chaotic. It is really impossible to find a rule. If we say that the character "Rong" in Wang Rong, General of Ning Shuo of Qi, was changed by later generations and cannot be used as evidence of using personal names and courtesy names together, then Zhang Rong, the Registrar of the Qi Minister of Works, should also be referred to by his courtesy name. Otherwise, the character "Rong" in Yu Rong violates the taboo of Emperor He of Qi. Why doesn't the character "Rong" in Zhang Rong also violate the taboo? Therefore, the statement in the summary of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" is simply perplexing to us.

However, these are just my humble opinions.

— Ji Yong

Recently, I continued reading Nehru's "The Discovery of India," which has many wonderful words. He wants to defend the history and culture of India, so he calls it "Discovery." In his seventh chapter, he describes the British invasion of India and the rise of the Indian national movement:

"Some Englishmen say: What makes the Indians most disgusted with us is nothing more than the Indian history we have written. This person can be said to have a considerable understanding of the Indians. To be honest: history is always written by the victors or conquerors. And it is according to their point of view. At least, their theory is the main component. Today, the angered companions of India, the officials, the rulers, the so-called upper class, are the Aryans who came from Central Asia in ancient times, that is, the early Indian conquerors. They wrote a lot of history at that time. Of course, these things are unfair to the indigenous people. Or, no one can jump out of their own ethnic concept circle, and it is even more difficult to escape their own cultural traditions and limitations. So, even if a person sometimes expresses a fair view, it may be regarded as treason in the eyes of his own nation. Especially war, is a more obvious example. It can make the nations or countries completely and systematically abandon justice and truth. As long as the other party thinks it is right, I must think it is wrong. Similarly, what I think is right, the other party also thinks the same. So, people's hearts become rough and close off all roads leading to the truth, leaving only the one they think is right. At this time, the greatest power is to explain one's own actions as reasonable, and to scold the other party as nonsense. Truth seems to be buried deep in the well, leaving ignorance to rule everything with the highest power."

Although we have not yet studied the Indian history written by the British in detail, it is probably not much different from the "History of Manchuria" written by the Japanese. Nehru's argument is also the theory of the Confucians that benevolence and righteousness exist only in the court of princes, and the theory of Laozi and Zhuangzi that each is what they are and each is not what they are, but it is said more concretely and clearly. Originally, I have repeatedly said that human reason is very limited and should not be overestimated because it is the spirit of all things. Xunzi's theory of the evil of human nature is not necessarily nonsense compared to Mencius's theory of the goodness of human nature. The right and wrong of history probably represent this lack of reason. The children of the countryside or the hawkers can have an objective standard to evaluate characters, just like watching Peking opera, the big white face must be a good guy, and the black face must be rough and rude, which is obvious at a glance. This is probably influenced by novels, dramas, and even legends and folk literature. There is no second saying or power that can contradict or conflict. If you read a little bit, you will feel some headache problems, such as the dispute of orthodoxy, the evaluation after death, each has its own position and each has its own background, like a kaleidoscope, ever-changing. It is enough to make people dizzy even without historians writing "Wu Mu is not a loyal minister theory" or "Zixu is not a filial son theory!" What's more, there are so many unashamed intellectuals who cater to the times, try to figure out the situation, and must play beautiful new music and sing praises to the emperor when Wang Mang is in power!

Those who study history are easily confused, mostly because of this. The work of textual critics and annotators is therefore endless. Like the fox burying its bones, they create their own confusion and then circle around it themselves, not knowing what they are doing! Hu Shih's diary of studying abroad, Volume 15, Article 48, "Following the Way Instead of the Ungodly," is a very apt discussion. I will copy it to clarify the above:

"Wang Renqiu is dead. Ten years ago, I read his 'Xiangqilou Letter,' which contained a letter to his daughter-in-law, saying, 'They entered my capital, and they cannot destroy me. What can there be to divide? Even if they divide, following the way instead of the ungodly, what is wrong!' I was very angry when I read it at that time, thinking that this old man did not know how to love his country and was saying such shameless words! In the past ten years, my thinking has also changed. Now I think that the saying 'following the way instead of the ungodly' only does not conform to the nationalism of today. Judging fairly, this saying is originally the old intention passed down by the ancient sages of our country. How can we blame an eighty-year-old scholar with the heresy of nineteenth-century Europe? I once said that nationalism (ethnic nationalism) has only one basis on which to stand, and all others are insufficient to argue. What is this only basis? It says: 'The autonomy of one nation will always be better than the rule of another nation.' Only this premise. For example, the reason why our country's anti-Manchuism can be established is precisely because the history of the Manchu ethnic group for 270 years has been enough to prove that they cannot rule the Han ethnic group. If you get a Yuan Shikai by removing a Manchu, it is not necessarily better than that. It is not necessarily better than that, so we will not tolerate it because it is of the same race. This is why the second and third revolutions arose. If you let people choose between Yuan Shikai and Wilson, then people must choose Wilson. Those who choose Yuan Shikai because Wilson is a different ethnic group must be fools poisoned by nationalism. This is the meaning of following the way instead of the ungodly. I have wronged Wang Renqiu. Now this old man is dead, so I record this to redeem myself...'"

This was said in the sixth year of the Republic. At that time, Yuan Shikai died because of his failed attempt to become emperor. Soon after, there was the restoration of Emperor Xuantong. Hu Shih was in the United States and would soon return to China. If you replace Wilson with Yuan Shikai, what would be the outcome from a nationalist perspective? Wang Renqiu's argument, first, it erases justice, and then, in a turn, it becomes supreme justice. Think about it, how terrible are human theories and perspectives! When the First World War broke out, Britain declared war on Germany, and the whole country conscripted soldiers, but the great philosopher Russell rose up and launched the Anti-Conscription Association. Noah Conscription Fellowship was therefore expelled from Cambridge University and punished by law. How should this be explained?

I once read an article by Liang Sicheng called "Outside the Window," which says that those of us who sit inside the window can never understand what is outside. This window exists wherever we go. So, we and society are always separated by a layer of windows. Although we can see it, we don't completely understand it after all. Moreover, there is no relationship between interests. How can scholars and young people who claim to go to the countryside, carrying cameras and bringing folding beds to the masses in fifteenth-century production methods and wearing short cloth clothes, break through each other's windows? This is very interesting. It makes me think of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great's construction of the new capital St. Petersburg, calling it "opening the window of Eastern Europe to circulate the air of Western Europe." It can be seen that having a window and opening it is not enough to fulfill the window's responsibility. We may still be able to open the windows between each other and be sincere with others who exist at the same time. —But in reality, it is quite difficult. Just look at the international disputes today and you will know. —But for the ancients who are separated by hundreds or even thousands of years, how can we "make friends" with them? Then this window is like the window of Qin Shi Huang's Mausoleum on Mount Li. Once the burial is completed, it is sealed, making the world imagine the fish oil lamps, the shooting mechanisms, and the crossbows, but there is no way to see its true appearance?

### Memoirs and the Like

— Yan Ru

Chinese newspapers almost all have supplements, and the supplements invariably have long articles, which are invariably novels! I am very sorry to say that having read newspapers for over forty years, I rarely read the long novels in the supplements. Not out of contempt, but out of fear of boredom. If it's an old-style novel where dialogue isn't written on separate lines, you might still find a little story interesting each day, but if it's new-style, then "How are you?" he said. "Thank you, I am well," she replied.

With this kind of thing, you can only hear a few polite words from the male protagonist each day. A long novel like Remarque's "Arch of Triumph" would take years to finish reading. A colossal work like Hugo's "Les Misérables" simply couldn't be completed in less than ten or twenty years. So in my personal opinion, publishing long novels in newspaper supplements is really not as good as publishing memoirs. The Shen Bao's publication of Herriot's memoirs made me love reading it every day. Although being published in a supplement means it can't be several thousand words a day, the content is factual, which is much better than "How are you? I am well."

Currently, it is a time when memoirs are popular. Although the world is not yet at peace after several years of war, it has at least provided some military and political giants with material to write memoirs. This war can be considered worthwhile for that reason alone. Yesterday, the newspaper reported that Tojo was also going to write one, "to be published after his execution, to provide for the needs of his family." This is a good deal. I think Tojo would write one even if he weren't executed. From this, you can see that being a "big shot" is worth it after all. Whether you succeed or fail, are good or evil, you still have the qualification to write memoirs and earn a large amount of manuscript fees.

Memoirs are a type of autobiography, but they are relatively limited to a particular time or event. Some say that the development of biography is related to the prosperity of a nation, and cite the prevalence of biographical literature in 19th-century England as evidence. Although I don't know if this is true, considering the lack of biographical literature in China and the fact that China's national fortune is not particularly prosperous, there may be some truth to it. However, the main reason for the lack of biographical literature in China, I think, lies in the self-effacement of great men and gentlemen. Mr. Hu Shi was a bit of a biography enthusiast, constantly urging Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Zhang Jusheng to write autobiographies, but his own "Forty-Year Self-Narration" only covered up to his twenties before he stopped. It seems that he will only finish it when he is eighty, and the "Eighty-Year Self-Narration" won't be started until he is a hundred.

Besides autobiographies, there are biographies of others, which are also rare in China. Not to mention others, even the biography of Mr. Sun Yat-sen has yet to be done well. The reason for this, besides the self-effacement of those qualified to write biographies, may also be related to the Chinese obsession with perfection. People are not gods, and shortcomings are inevitable. For example, in Lytton Strachey's biography of Queen Victoria, he made some subtle criticisms of the Queen and the Prince Consort, but the British royal family was magnanimous enough not to ban it, and readers found the subject of the biography more relatable and endearing because she had human imperfections. Chinese biographies of others are different. There is a fear that the subject might have even the slightest flaw exposed, making them seem less like the bodhisattvas in temples. Under these conditions, it is difficult to start writing an autobiography, and writing a biography of others is also hopeless.

On a much smaller scale than biographies, and not necessarily about famous officials or magnates, are character sketches. American magazines seem to have a lot of this kind of work, whether it's about how a black man's son studied hard and succeeded, or how a country doctor is happy to provide medical care, or how an eighty-year-old woman makes things convenient for others, or how a disabled person strives to overcome the difficulties of eye and leg problems, making readers feel that they should strive to be optimistic and not always sigh and want to die. There are plenty of such nameless people in China. Even if you write a few disrespectful words, such as saying that a person's sitting posture is incorrect or their standing posture is unsteady, you won't be punished or suffer. I think we can emulate this to add some vitality to the gloomy Chinese literary style. I wonder if the wise think this is right?

### A Clever Way to Win a Case

— Shirley

In a car accident case, the plaintiff's lawyer presented a witness and claimed that the witness saw the defendant's broken speedometer pointing to an illegal speed of 75 miles per hour moments after the accident.

When the witness was brought to court, the defendant's defense lawyer asked, "Do you smoke cigarettes?"

"Um—I do," the astonished witness replied. He didn't know what the defendant's lawyer meant by asking this question.

"Camel brand?" the lawyer asked again.

"Yes."

"Good, now please tell the court, does the camel driver on the Camel cigarette pack wear a hat?"

"Yes," he replied quickly.

The defendant's lawyer took a pack of Camel cigarettes out of his pocket and handed it to the witness.

"I know you are an honest man," he then said, "and you wouldn't lie for no reason. Like this cigarette pack, there is no camel driver on it at all, but after I asked you if this person wears a hat, you really thought there was such a person. It's the same with this case. The plaintiff's lawyer said that you saw the needle on the speedometer pointing to a speed of 75 miles per hour—my client denies it, and the same impression was created in your mind, as if you did see something that you didn't actually see."

The defendant finally won the case.

### No Reductions Allowed

— Nian Hong

With great difficulty, the salaries of public school teachers were adjusted once.

The "adjustment" mentioned here actually contains a double meaning. It is not just a different name for a price increase, as is commonly understood. Because this salary adjustment for public school teachers, although discussed and studied several times by some committee, some yuan, and some department, resulted in greater losses for those with smaller base salaries and more increases for those with larger base salaries. For those with base salaries below one hundred yuan, not only was there no increase of even half a Taiwanese dollar), but instead, they received a 30% or 20% cut. Every time public utilities and daily necessities are adjusted, they increase by 50% to 100%, but the salaries of public school teachers are adjusted to be even lower than before.

On the surface, the index seems to be larger, but the in-kind distribution is reduced and the differential subsidy is lowered. In the end, it is still a clear increase but a hidden decrease, advancing in order to retreat. Poor public school teachers have once again eaten an empty bowl of soup! If it were a clear salary reduction, that would be fine, but unfortunately, those who don't know the truth always think that salaries have been increased, and they wouldn't think of anything else, would they?

But this year seems to be the "year of bad luck for public school teachers." It's not enough that they secretly suffered from this adjustment. News has come that the government's administrative program for this year includes a clause on reducing staff and simplifying administration, and various agencies will tighten their organizations and prepare to eliminate 25% of redundant personnel. This is a serious problem because salary adjustment is ultimately a question of whether or not one can eat enough, while personnel reduction is a question of whether or not one has food to eat at all. Twenty-five percent is not a small number. Where will these laid-off personnel find work? I wonder if anyone has thought about this? Assuming they have thought about it, besides letting them fend for themselves, I wonder if there is a feasible solution?

If anyone goes to look at the offices of government agencies today, they will all feel that there are indeed many redundant personnel to be laid off today. Because what is astonishing is that many government agencies seem to be full of "civil servants" who are empty-handed, reading tabloids, and humming tunes in the office. If these redundant personnel are not laid off, it will of course be a waste of national expenditure and an increase in the burden on the people. But these redundant personnel are mostly the "old masters" who cannot be touched by others. Once layoffs begin, even if 75% of the staff are laid off, it won't be their heads that are on the chopping block. Instead, it is the hard-working members of each agency who will be sacrificed under the layoff order. They are dependent on no one, so of course they will bear the brunt and will inevitably be included in the list of those to be laid off. In this way, if the backbone of the agencies is all driven away, administrative efficiency will definitely drop sharply, to an unexpected degree.

Salary reductions have already been implemented, and it seems that layoffs are inevitable. It is probably of very little use to say now that layoffs should not be made. But the first to be affected by the layoffs will of course be the laid-off group, and directly or indirectly, the entire administrative efficiency will be affected. In the end, nothing can be done. Suddenly, I thought of the dispute caused by the ban on dancing by dance hall workers, and I couldn't help but feel a chill run down my spine.

### Several Poems Remembering Sanmu, Shufan, Baicao, and Others in Shanghai

— Yao Yuanchu

How can a clear stream be mixed with a turbid stream? All the gentlemen in my eyes live in high buildings together:
They would not beg for rice from the barbarian slaves, and drunkenly scolded the reckless garrison commander.
The wolves are exhausted, but you, sir, are not yet old, and countless wine cups are used to repay each other.
I wonder if you also think of me, a distant traveler? Above, I face the cold in a tattered fur coat!

### Reply to Mr. Yuanchu and Inquiring About the Invitation to Tour Hangzhou

— Shi Shufan

The first willows of the capital brush against light carriages, who would wear tattered wheat and endure mockery?
The cold office is clear enough to seal white letters, the whole family happily speaks of living in black clothes!
My heart follows the wooden boat's lakeside agreement, and the writing feast flies over the sea like spring clouds.
Poetry should always prioritize feelings of joy and sorrow, knowing that you are rarely supplementing admonishments to the emperor.

### Tofu and Pork

— Guang Jue

Among the mundane reports that my wife constantly brings back from the vegetable market, two are slightly interesting.

First, she wants me to guess, what is the one thing whose business is worse than usual during the New Year, when everything else sells well? I couldn't guess, but it turns out to be tofu. Tofu is vegetarian, good quality, and inexpensive, and people eat too much of it usually. During the New Year, people should keep it at a distance. In addition, everything during the New Year should be auspicious, but this thing seems to symbolize something unlucky. It is always present in mourning ceremonies, which are also called tofu meals. Besides its white color, I don't know what other reason there is. People who study folklore should be able to explain it.

Second, she tells me that the landlady of the tailor shop next door went to the vicinity of the railway station to buy a piece of pork, and the price was half that of the vegetable market. When she got home, she washed it again and again, looked at it, smelled it, and was always uneasy, fearing that it was not fresh, even suspecting that it was a dead pig. My wife's meaning is that it's rare to eat meat, so why bother to save a little money and make yourself depressed during the New Year. I think that it is precisely because it is rare to eat meat that people want to eat more meat during the New Year. It is better to save a little money after all. Fearing that the quality is not guaranteed, they have no choice but to buy cheaper goods. From this little thing, you can write about the suffering of the people. However, I told her to tell the tailor shop landlady that the casual customers these days are just rushing for the holiday season. The reason why it is cheaper is because of the slaughter tax and the profits of the meat vendors and butcher shops. The meat is definitely the same good, so you can eat it with peace of mind.

People are always afraid of being deceived by others, but in fact, others are just trying to make a living, and they don't all rely on deception to make a living. If everyone could live more easily, this kind of unpleasant emotion could be eliminated.

### Race

— Wu Jiu

A small thief suddenly broke into a dormitory at Kansas State University in the United States. He secretly opened the refrigerator, gorged himself on the food stored in the refrigerator, and after eating his fill, he carried a chicken in one hand and two pounds of fish in the other. But when he tried to sneak away, he was suddenly discovered by the students, so these young people ran after him. Unexpectedly, after chasing for half a mile, they still couldn't catch him.

The students didn't mind the food. What frustrated them was that they couldn't catch the thief who had flown away. And one of the students was particularly frustrated, his name was Ray Adey—a famous long-distance runner in the United States!

### Talking about Plum Blossoms in Chao Mountain

— Tangxi

Spring has come to the world, and the annual Chao Mountain plum blossom viewing tour is busy with preparations again. Those who tour Chao Mountain mostly want to catch a glimpse of the Song Plum. In fact, the beauty of Chao Mountain plum blossoms lies in the fact that they encircle ten miles, like a sea of fragrant snow. Therefore, plum blossom viewers should stroll slowly around the mountain, with the Dragon Cave and the Qian Yuan Taoist Temple as the endpoint, in order to truly appreciate the charm. As for the so-called Song Plum, it is suspected that those who like novelty transplanted it here from somewhere else, and then used the old objects of the Song Palace as a gimmick. Without evidence, it is not believable. Moreover, this plum blossom has been neglected during the war, and half of the plant has withered. Only half of the plant still has flowers blooming against the rocks. It seems that it will soon be split into firewood. The nearby Daming Hall (Bao Ci Temple), the temple is not grand, and the monks are also vulgar. The Xiang Hai Tower is a place to rest and drink, but it is not worth mentioning compared to the beauty of the Helin Buddhist Palace. A poem by Yao, a local villager, "The site of the six tombs is vague and desolate, why does a single fragrance remain after hundreds of kalpas? It is not about the historical records that the flowers were originally good, nor is it about relying on false names that the scenery is self-evident! I have experienced many changes in the world, and I laugh at the warmth and coldness of welcoming and sending off officials. I pity the towering pride of the bone, and diligently discuss rice and grain with the mountain monk!" is very satirical and realistic, so I will record it here as well.

### The Chronicle of Hanshan Temple

— Yu Yifen

Liang Rengong's National Studies Bibliography once listed the book "Records of Stones" by Ye Changchi of Changzhou. Ye's given name was Yuandu, and his style name was Jushang. He was proficient in the study of bronze and stone inscriptions and supplementary editions. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he compiled the "Chronicle of Hanshan Temple" at the request of Su Fu Cheng Xuelou (Dequan). After the book was completed, Xuelou asked to read it. Before long, the Qing dynasty was overthrown, and the manuscript remained in the court and was not issued. Ye felt the sorrow of leaving his homeland, so he revised it once and wrote a postscript during the Gaojie Festival in the Renzi year (1912), signing himself as a "remnant of the Ji Jian," not without subtle criticism of Xuelou's betrayal. An appendix was attached to the postscript, in which he expressed deep dissatisfaction with a certain young master, reportedly referring to Zheng Shuwen (Wenzhuo), who was known as Dahe, because Shuwen had made some criticisms of the book. The entire chronicle consists of three volumes: Volume 1 includes "Chronicle of Bridges," "Chronicle of Temples," "Chronicle of Images," and "Chronicle of Bells." Volume 2 includes "Chronicle of Steles," "Chronicle of Monks," "Chronicle of Properties," "Chronicle of Tours," and "Chronicle of Events." Volume 3 includes "Chronicle of Poems," with appendices on the "Deeds of Hanshan and Shide," "Annotations on the Collection of Hanshan's Poems," and "Various Documents, Poems, and Prefaces." It was printed in two volumes, engraved in April of the Renxu year (1922) by Pan's Publishing House in Wuxian, with the signature of Wu Yinpei of Wuxian, about ten years after the book was completed.

The engraver of the "Chronicle of Hanshan Temple," Pan Zhongwu (Zunian), was the younger brother of Pan Wenqin (Zuyin, style name Boyin), a famous official of the Qing Dynasty, and also a student of Grand Historian Jushang. Ye's posthumous works were all engraved by Pan. During the late Qing Dynasty, Zhongwu served as a censor in the Ministry of Justice. He resigned and returned home at the age of twenty-two because of his role in supervising executions, and had a seal engraved with the inscription "Returning to the Fields at Twenty." Mr. Wu Hufan was Pan's son-in-law, and I was able to read this chronicle through Hufan's permission.

### Happy Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 10: Willing Sacrifice 76

Little Wang's mother spat and said, "Don't talk nonsense, who would believe you!" Zhu Zhai said, "Really, I had a good impression of you the first time I saw you." Little Wang's mother said, "What good impression?" Zhu Zhai said, "As soon as I saw you, I knew you were clever and cute, and also a very gentle and affectionate girl." Little Wang's mother shook her head repeatedly and said, "Don't say that, don't say that, I'm not worthy! I'm a rough person, a country girl. What gentle and affectionate, you should say that to the boss!" Zhu Zhai said, "Well, then, I won't use many words to describe you, I'll just say that you are a good person, with a conscience, you can't deny that!" Little Wang's mother nodded and said, "Everyone should be like that. The boss usually values honesty. Among her many friends, she pays attention to Mr. Xu because Mr. Xu is honest, and what Mr. Xu says is reliable, she often tells me that." Zhu Zhai sighed when he heard this and said, "Where has she gone now?" Little Wang's mother said, "She will come back, she is always kept by that friend. It's almost dawn, go to sleep." As she spoke, she smiled slightly. Zhu Zhai then retracted his hand into the quilt, closed his eyes, and his heart was a mess, how could he fall asleep! From time to time, he secretly opened his eyes to take a look, and saw Little Wang's mother massaging herself with one hand, her eyes still fixed on his face, without the slightest bit of fatigue. Whenever she saw Zhu Zhai open his eyes, she would smile at him slightly. At this time, Zhu Zhai's heart was only focused on Qi Wan, and he felt that Little Wang's mother was like a falling flower with intentional love, but the flowing water was merciless. He closed his eyes in the same way, in a daze. Between sleeping and not sleeping, he was suddenly awakened by a crisp doorbell. Little Wang's mother quickly jumped out of bed, put on her shoes, and went out to open the door. After a while, she came back in. Zhu Zhai had already shouted loudly, "Is the boss back?" He asked twice in a row, but Little Wang's mother didn't answer.

### The Death of Yamamoto Isoroku

— Translated by Daren

A very special event occurred in the Pacific War in the Solomon Islands, where U.S. forces were preparing to invade New Georgia.

On April 17, a top-secret intelligence report was transmitted to the U.S. Air Force commander in the Solomon Islands, detailing the itinerary of Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, commander-in-chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, who was then inspecting Japanese military bases in the South and Southwest Pacific. According to the report, Yamamoto was scheduled to depart from Rabaul the next morning on a "Betty" (Mitsubishi Type 1 twin-engine bomber), accompanied by his staff in another aircraft of the same type, with a close escort of six Zero fighters. The eight aircraft were scheduled to land at Kahili airfield at 9:45 a.m. local time. The directive ordered the U.S. military commander in the area to use "maximum effort" to destroy Yamamoto. The directive was signed by Secretary of the Navy Knox.

The closest Allied air base to Kahili airfield was the newly built Bainega airfield on the Russell Islands, but Bainega airfield did not have long-range fighters, and the order to attack Yamamoto designated the U.S. Army P-38 Lightning squadron temporarily stationed at Henderson airfield to carry out the mission, commanded by Major Mitchell (John W. Mitchell).

Even with full fuel, the aircraft's endurance was only 500 miles, but from Henderson airfield to Kahili airfield, even the shortest U.S. route was 300 miles. At that time, the central Solomon Islands were occupied by Japanese forces, and the route that the U.S. pilots wanted to take was an arc to the southwest of the central Solomon Islands, because they were afraid of being detected by enemy radar stations, but this route was 400 miles long. Therefore, there was very little time to attack Yamamoto near Kahili airfield. At the suggestion of Major Mitchell and Captain Lanphier (Thomas G. Lanphier Jr.), it was decided to attempt to attack Yamamoto at a location 35 miles northwest of Kahili airfield.

At that time, the secret was not kept well at Henderson airfield, and a large number of officers and soldiers knew the purpose of the trip. This later embarrassed the command.

Eighteen Lightning aircraft could participate in the mission. Major Mitchell designated four to carry out the attack, commanded by Captain Lanphier, and he himself commanded fourteen aircraft for strong cover. Yamamoto was in service when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and had boasted that he would dictate peace terms in the White House, so he was hated by the Americans. It was then expected that as soon as Yamamoto's aircraft arrived at Kahili airfield, the local Japanese air force commander would send out more than 100 aircraft to welcome him.

Of the four aircraft under Captain Lanphier, one blew a tire on the runway and did not take off, and another had mechanical problems and did not take off either. So Major Mitchell sent two more aircraft to supplement them, leaving only twelve aircraft to provide cover.

When flying to Bougainville Island, they flew low over the sea ("flat-top flight") at a speed of 250 miles per hour, and everything went smoothly. Five minutes before the scheduled attack time, the U.S. aircraft ascended into the air, Lanphier's aircraft ascended to 10,000 feet, and Mitchell's aircraft ascended to 21,000 feet. They flew over the Bougainville coast at 9:33.

The success of the attack almost entirely depended on the accurate estimation of Yamamoto's timing. Fortunately, Yamamoto had a habit of keeping strict time, and the U.S. intelligence officers knew this and had informed the U.S. aircrew. As a result, according to U.S. estimates, Yamamoto arrived one minute early. At 9:34, two enemy bombers and six Zero fighters arrived. The expected large number of Japanese aircraft to welcome them did not materialize.

The leading Zero fighter headed straight for Captain Lanphier, and Lanphier shot it down. At this time, Yamamoto's aircraft and his staff's aircraft dived rapidly, almost to the treetops. Lanphier followed the rapid dive, trying to attack the leading aircraft, while also having to evade the attack of two enemy Zero fighters. According to Lanphier's own estimate, he descended to within ten feet of the treetops and made a right angle to the flight line of Yamamoto's aircraft. He opened fire and made a long-range shot. The right engine and right wing of Yamamoto's aircraft caught fire and crashed into the jungle, burning down. (According to later Japanese reports, Yamamoto died in his seat, with his military sword still upright between his thighs.) Lieutenant Barber avoided the attack of three Zero aircraft in the same way and shot down the aircraft of Yamamoto's staff. The only U.S. loss was an aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Hine, who was seen to have his aircraft fall, with smoke trailing from the tail, after a melee with the three Zero aircraft attacking Lieutenant Barber. Hine was never heard from again.

The U.S. military base on Guadalcanal celebrated greatly, and the good news was published in the U.S. Air Force's news briefing. The U.S. side was very afraid that the Japanese side would discover that the U.S. side knew that Yamamoto was on this aircraft, because if the Japanese side discovered this, then they could explore the source of this information. However, the Japanese side always thought that Yamamoto's aircraft was just accidentally destroyed by the U.S. side, and not deliberately targeted, although they were slightly suspicious.

In fact, the inside story is very simple: the U.S. Naval Intelligence Agency had "broken" the Japanese Navy's code a year before this incident occurred. And the knowledge of Yamamoto's itinerary was obtained from intercepting Japanese radio messages. (Translated from Gilbert Cant's "The Great Pacific War")
