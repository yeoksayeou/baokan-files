### Favorable Developments in the Bengbu-Suzhou Battle; Nationalist Troops Advancing Northward Reached Guzhen Yesterday; Armored Corps Captured Liuzhuang Southeast of Xuzhou

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] According to reports received here tonight from relevant sources, the Nationalist troops advancing north along the Jinpu Railway have recaptured Guzhen tonight, but this news has not been officially announced by the military.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 30th] The Bengbu-Suzhou battle is still developing under the active initiative of the Nationalist forces. Although the prelude to the battle has begun, it has not yet reached the stage of fierce fighting. According to military estimates, the Communist bandits are moving south with a force of about 200,000. Most of the main force, under the close pressure of the Sun, Qiu, and Li three army corps advancing south from Xuzhou, is now massing on both sides of the Hui River west of the Jinpu Railway. A part, about 40,000, has crossed the Xie River (between the Hui River and the North Fei River) and is moving towards Huaiyuan. Another force of about 5,000 is heading towards Cao Lao Ji. Last night, more than 200 scattered bandits infiltrated west of Cao Lao Ji and were completely annihilated by Nationalist forces. The Nationalist forces, based on their original plan, have completed their deployment on the banks of the North Fei River, so the Communist bandits' gradual southward movement is likely to get bogged down and be unable to extricate themselves.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 30th] (1) Liu Zhi flew to the front line by special plane yesterday afternoon to inspect. (2) The Air Force, in coordination with ground troops on the 29th, killed more than 10,000 bandits in the Xinqiao front. (3) The curfew time in Bengbu will be moved forward by half an hour from today, starting at 9:00 PM.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 30th] Southbound trains from here are still running as usual today, but northbound trains have been suspended.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] The government officially denied rumors of ordering the withdrawal from Xuzhou on the 30th, while semi-official sources admitted that the main battle area in northern Jiangsu is gradually moving south. Bengbu has now become the focus of the war, with the one-eyed general Liu Bocheng in the west and Chen Yi in the east. The vanguard of the Communist offensive continues to move south. The rumor of ordering the withdrawal from Xuzhou was apparently caused by the announcement that the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, led by Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, had moved to Bengbu, and by the advance of two army corps to the south.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 30th] The armored units, in coordination with the Qiu Army Corps, defeated the Zhongnan (i.e., the 16th) Column of the East Shandong Military Region, 12 kilometers southeast of Xuzhou at Liutang River, and continued to capture Liuzhuang, 50 li southeast of Xuzhou. In this battle, they seized 20 heavy machine guns, 30 light machine guns, and over 500 rifles, killed over 3,000 bandits, and captured over 300 bandits.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] Lieutenant Colonel Jiang Weiguo, Chief of Staff of the Armored Forces Command, accompanied by Chen Shoucheng, Director of the Political Warfare Department, flew to Xuzhou by special plane at 10:00 AM on the 30th, bringing a large number of comfort items to express sympathy to the officers and soldiers of the armored units participating in the Battle of Xuzhou.

[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch on the 30th] Fierce fighting continues in the western mountain area of Taiyuan. A part of the bandit's 5th Brigade, facing Huaritou about 40 li west of the city, launched another fierce attack on our positions on the morning of the 30th. The defending troops resolutely resisted, and the positions remained secure. Fighting continued with the bandits until evening. Another part of the bandit's New 4th Brigade launched a fierce attack on the high ground west of Shagouliang. After a fierce battle until about 3:00 PM, our reinforcements arrived and launched an attack from both inside and outside, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits, who fled in a hurry to the northwest area of Shagouliang. According to preliminary statistics, over 1,000 bandits were killed or wounded in both areas today.

Another bandit army's 2nd Battalion, with more than ten Japanese-style tanks, infiltrated Tongxian from Lengkou on the 26th. In addition to the daily reconnaissance and bombing by iron wing units, the Nationalist troops on the Ping-Gu Road are coordinating with the anti-bandit forces in eastern Hebei, conducting mobile searches and suppression along the Qian-Gan River.

[Central News Agency Peiping Dispatch on the 30th] The infantry and cavalry units searching and suppressing eastward in Pingdong, after clearing the remaining bandits along the line from Xiangfutou, Xuzhaolin, and Dazhaolin (east of Qukouzhen and west of Sanhe) on the afternoon of the 29th, have approached the vicinity of Sanhe.

### Dr. Lin Dawei Talks About Dr. Sun Ke's Tumor Removal

Full Recovery Still Requires Eight or Nine Days

[Our Report] President Sun is still staying at the Sino-Belgian Zhen Ding Hospital for treatment. Many people from all walks of life, such as Wu Tiecheng and Liu Weizhi, sent many flowers. However, Mr. Sun followed the doctor's advice and did not receive any visitors other than family members in order to recover as soon as possible and go to Nanjing to form a cabinet. Yesterday, a reporter visited Dr. Lin Dawei, who performed the surgery on Mr. Sun. According to reports, the tumor on Mr. Sun's left upper thigh was operated on this Monday. Starting at 9:00 AM that morning, a half-body local anesthesia was administered, and the surgery was successfully performed to remove the tumor, which took a total of one hour. The removed tumor was quite large, weighing two pounds. This time, a rapid surgery was adopted to reduce the patient's pain, lower the temperature as soon as possible, and quickly close the wound. Therefore, Mr. Sun was able to get out of bed and walk the day after the surgery. However, since the wound area after the tumor removal is quite large, it still requires several days of rest before a complete recovery can be achieved. It is estimated that it will take about eight or nine days. Currently, Mr. Sun's mental and physical condition are very normal, except for slightly high blood pressure. In addition to him presiding over the surgery, Dr. Wu Huanxing assisted from the side, and Dr. Shen Kefei participated in the discussion of the surgery.

It is also learned that Dr. Mo Dawei is a Chinese overseas from Montreal, Canada, originally from Xinhui, Guangdong. He is 33 years old this year and holds a Doctor of Medicine degree from McGill University in Canada, specializing in surgery. He returned to China for the first time only a year ago. Mr. Lin has a lot of experience in surgery. During his stay in Canada, he had particularly rich clinical experience in the latest open-chest and brain surgeries.

I ran for Vice President before based on this purpose. Since taking office, I have been conscientious and diligent. I have no desire to run for further advancement.

### Evaluation of Victory in the Xuzhou Campaign

— Our Reporter Ding Weidong

The severe military crisis that threatened Xuzhou for the past twenty days has now vanished like a nightmare. Of course, before the battles of Bengbu and Suxian come to a conclusion, the decisive battle east of Xuzhou cannot be said to have completely changed the war situation in Central China, but it has at least bought a precious month or two, allowing the military authorities to calmly deploy and reverse the almost irreparable decline after the fall of Jinan and the Northeast. At the same time, military and political personnel here and Chinese and foreign reporters who came to Xuzhou to observe the battle unanimously agreed that the greatest significance of this victory is the re-establishment of the confidence and morale of the National Army.

Factors of Victory

From the enemy's point of view, the Xuzhou Campaign was the product of excessive self-confidence. Because the communists wanted to make a desperate gamble and achieve success once and for all. The number of troops they mobilized was also unprecedented. The highest guiding principle of the communist forces' operations was to not easily engage with the main force of the National Army. Even if they fought a hard battle, it was a so-called "local decisive battle," unwilling to make a desperate gamble. However, this time the situation was completely different. Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng launched all their strength from Shandong, Henan, Anhui provinces with a great advantage, and pounced on this famous city in East China. According to official estimates, the total force used by Liu and Chen was about 600,000 men, of which 80% were Chen Yi's troops, which was the main force that engaged in a decisive battle with the National Army's Huang Baitao in Nianzhuang. The strength of Liu Bocheng's five columns was responsible for containing the National Army on the southern line of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Although Chen Yi was the main body of the force and his combat effectiveness was superior, Liu Bocheng was responsible for the overall command. According to General Du Yuming's explanation, Chen Yi is probably a rising star among the communists, and in terms of qualifications, he is far below Liu. At the same time, the latter's cunning tactics are also well known to the National Army.

Unfortunately, the National Army's forces facing this major offensive were in an inferior position. In this theater of war, the National Army could use about six army corps (Huang Baitao, Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, Sun Yuanliang, Li Yannian, and Huang Wei), but because the communist forces were the main attackers and the National Army was the main defender, in a vast theater of war, they inevitably had to spread their forces thinly. It is estimated that the National Army's forces on the eastern and western lines of Xuzhou were only 300,000 men, which was in an unfavorable position in terms of numbers. The tools the National Army relied on to win were, first, several extremely elite army corps, whose equipment and training were unmatched by the communist troops inside the pass. After Chen Yi's troops achieved victory in Jinan, they obtained a lot of heavy equipment, which they used to attack the periphery of Xuzhou. Chen Yi's troops were the most powerful communist army inside the pass, but if compared with the National Army's Qiu Qingquan Corps, there was still a big gap. The Qiu Corps had more than a thousand cannons of various calibers, while the main force of Chen Yi's troops attacking the Huang Corps used only about 200 cannons, a ratio of five to one in firepower. The second is the tank unit. In this major battle, what the communist forces feared most was the activity of the National Army's tanks. It is a pity that the tanks currently used by the National Army are still light tanks received from the Myanmar-India battlefield. They have not been replenished in recent years, and at the same time, they are urgently needed in various battlefields, and their strength is greatly dispersed. American friends estimate that the number of tanks used by the National Army on the Xuzhou battlefield is about 60, but in reality, it is far below this number. However, although the number is small, officials and soldiers alike admit that it reduces casualties during attacks. Just looking at the fact that after the peripheral battles of Xuzhou came to an end, Chiang Wei-kuo, Chief of Staff of the Armored Forces Headquarters, was ordered to go to Taiwan to prepare for the establishment of a tank training school, it can be seen that the importance of the armored forces in the war has made a deep impression on the central government. Another factor of victory for the National Army is the Air Force, which must include both combat and supply aspects. It is worth mentioning that the latter's contribution may be even more important than the former. The threat of the Air Force to the other side's ground forces, according to the opinions of the front-line National Army, may be limited by the number of aircraft, and its effect is not as great as the people in the rear imagine. For example, in terms of bombing, many villages on the periphery of Xuzhou have now become scorched earth, which can be seen clearly when the plane passes over the sky. However, according to the soldiers of the National Army, the communist forces now defend the villages by defending the surroundings but not the center, and the air-raid shelters are dug very effectively, so the casualties caused by air raids are not very large. However, this time, the National Army cooperated well with the Air Force. The ground forces were equipped with air-to-ground speakers to communicate with the Air Force at any time and jointly attack the enemy's strongholds. The artillery also exerted the advantages of precise shooting due to the Air Force's guidance. This advantage contributed greatly to the victory of the National Army. It is no wonder that the communist forces declared that if they captured the Air Force and artillery of the National Army, they would retaliate with inhumane punishments. The Air Force's supply troops can be described as silent, unnamed heroes in this major battle, but in fact, they are the main builders of victory. To give the most obvious example, during the fierce battle on the eastern front of Xuzhou, the supply line on the southern line of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was cut off after Suxian fell due to insufficient forces. Xuzhou had in fact become an isolated city. Without air supply, the army's food would be a problem. However, the air transport troops played a role at this time, transporting rice and ammunition from Nanjing to the front line in an endless stream, and transferring a large number of wounded soldiers from Xuzhou to the rear for treatment. Their tireless efforts made a contribution to maintaining morale that is difficult to estimate. (Continued on page 4)

Editorial

### Handling the Shanghai Refugee Problem

In recent days, refugees from north of the Yangtze River have been pouring into Shanghai like a tide. Faced with this serious problem, the Bureau of Social Affairs, in addition to actively launching winter relief fundraising, has also submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward to the Central Government to quickly formulate a solution to thoroughly relieve and evacuate them, so as to avoid refugees from all over gathering in one place. Shanghai is already a city of five million people, and the source of food and fuel is very difficult. Now, in this extraordinary period, society is turbulent and people are uneasy. If the cold winter is added, the relief of refugees will become a serious and worrying matter. The Shanghai Municipal Authorities are brave in taking responsibility for the relief of refugees, and we deeply agree with this, and hope that the refugee problem facing us will be dealt with quickly and effectively, so as to reduce the phenomenon of refugees concentrating in cities.

Shanghai has always been a city with a wide gap between rich and poor and uneven distribution of happiness and suffering. The annual increase in Shanghai's population is accompanied by an increase in poor and helpless people. These poor people and refugees from the north account for a large proportion of Shanghai's population and have become the most serious social problem. According to an investigation by our reporter in February of this year, in addition to the poor people and refugees wandering in the streets who are difficult to estimate, there are as many as 64,000 poor families living in shantytowns, divided into: 15,000 families in South Shanghai, about 80,000 people; 15,000 families in West Shanghai, about 90,000 people; 8,000 families in North Shanghai, about 50,000 people; 20,000 families in East Shanghai, about 100,000 people; and 6,000 families in Pudong, about 30,000 people. Since the beginning of this year, the influx of refugees has been increasing day by day. According to an investigation by the Municipal Police Bureau in June, there were about 16,000 refugees who had not been accommodated. After June, newcomers continued to pour in, especially in recent months, refugees from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line and northern Jiangsu have successively poured in, distributed in urban and rural areas, either accommodated by the authorities or still wandering in the streets, lonely and helpless, not knowing where to turn to. From the perspective of social security, this is a threat to the tranquility and order of Shanghai society; from the perspective of social problems, this is the best opportunity for Shanghai citizens to be considerate of others and be willing to help others.

First, let's talk about social relief: The relief of poor people and refugees is a type of social relief. In the past, Shanghai had a "Winter Relief Association" for the relief of refugees, and its main tasks were to provide shelter from the cold and distribute porridge. This contained the meaning of almsgiving and charity, and it failed to cooperate with administrative plans. The "Winter Relief Association" ended in April and established the "Shanghai Relief Committee," which, in addition to continuing the work of winter relief, also planned to implement active welfare measures to stabilize the lives of the unemployed and homeless refugees. Because for several months, they only focused on fundraising and design work, the establishment of "Relief Homes," "Civilian Villages," and "Work-for-Relief Offices" has not been discussed yet. Now that the cold winter solstice is approaching and the situation is extremely serious, the refugee problem is imminent. It is hoped that the Relief Committee will work hard, based on the experience of winter relief in previous years, and quickly launch relief work. It is also hoped that local philanthropists will assist the government and relief agencies in implementing various relief efforts in accordance with the spirit of helping the weak and aiding the poor. Although this cannot completely solve the social problem, it can undoubtedly eliminate the hidden dangers of the social problem passively.

Secondly, let's talk about social security. Although social security in extraordinary periods is not completely threatened by the refugee problem, the increase in refugees in a turbulent society can constitute a major burden for the local government, such as the burden of food and clothing, as well as the burden of living security. These burdens have a direct and indirect impact on the tranquility and order of society. Therefore, in order to ensure social security in extraordinary periods, local governments should, in addition to passively accommodating and relieving refugees, effectively evacuate them to reduce the concentration of refugees. This is indeed very important and should be known and acted upon immediately. On the one hand, the evacuation method is to assist refugees to return to their hometowns in a planned way. If they cannot return to their hometowns temporarily, they should be evacuated to provinces and regions with sparse populations to engage in farmland cultivation and industrial production, and not allow the dispersed people who are concentrated in the cities to linger and forget to return. On the other hand, the evacuation method is to strictly restrict the entry of refugees. All ports and stations in Shanghai must be strictly inspected and registered. Those who have no relatives or friends to rely on or those who cannot produce work are refused entry and sent back free of charge, or accommodated by neighboring counties, and the expenses are subsidized by the city. These evacuation methods are all methods that take helping others as the root of happiness, and they are reasonable and should not be difficult to implement.

In short, the current refugee problem in Shanghai has constituted a serious social problem. If effective measures are not taken from both social relief and social security, the threat to Shanghai's security will be worrying.

### 300,000 Pro-Soviet Germans Demonstrate; East Berlin Government Established; Sokolovsky Protests West Berlin Elections in Writing; Tensions High on the Border of the British, American, and Soviet Zones

[United Press Berlin 30th] The Communist Party of Germany, supported by the Soviet Union, established another city government in Berlin today to stand in opposition to the anti-communist city government. The anti-communist city government will be formally elected by the citizens this Sunday. The Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin has prohibited citizens from participating in the voting.

[United Press Berlin 30th] The German Communist Party convened a large demonstration on the 30th to support the establishment of a separate government planned by the Soviet Union in the eastern sector. The West German authorities ordered the police to be on alert. Special units of the German police were dispatched to the border between the Soviet and British zones, where 30,000 workers will gather on the "Unter den Linden" avenue on the afternoon of the 30th to compete in a short-term showdown with the anti-communist pre-parliamentary demonstration of September 9th. After listening to speeches, the workers will march in formation to the State Academy of Arts, where the "democratic council" of 300 city council members will produce a separate government for East Berlin, ultimately splitting the city government and completely dividing Berlin. Political experts believe that the Communist Party's actions are aimed at counteracting the municipal elections in the western sectors next Sunday.

[United Press Berlin 29th] The Berlin Communist Party and the Soviet authorities have been brewing a new crisis in Berlin on the 29th, and they are apparently preparing to announce the establishment of a Red German government in the Soviet zone. Marshal Sokolovsky, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, has formally protested in writing to the Western military authorities in Germany against the city elections on the 7th. Sokolovsky denounced the election as being forcibly imposed on the Germans through "police persecution by democratic organizations." Sokolovsky also threatened to take action against the anti-democratic elements in the city government. This will divide Berlin into two. Colonel Howley, the U.S. military commander in Berlin, stated at a press conference regarding the Communist Party's threats and the decision by the Western Allies to hold municipal elections in the western sectors that the Soviet Union's actions are part of a "rule by force" plan. Howley also stated that the time for a complete diplomatic showdown between East and West has matured. Berlin is only the crisis center of the East-West split. Before the Berlin problem can be completely resolved, the Soviet Union must change its attitude. First, the Soviet Union should lift the Berlin blockade and stop using force politically. Second, the Soviet Union should fulfill all treaties not only in writing but also in spirit. Third, allow the Germans to establish their autonomous government without pro-communists. Fourth, stop the anti-American movement in Germany. Fifth, stop acts of terror such as kidnapping and illegally arresting anti-communist Germans. Sixth, show trust and a spirit of compromise.

### New Mediation Plan for the Berlin Problem; Four Powers Express Acceptance; Commission to Be Established to Study the Currency System

[United Press Paris 29th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia stated today that Soviet representative Vyshinsky has "expressed agreement" to the new plan for neutral countries on the Security Council to mediate the Berlin dispute. The United States, Britain, and France have also accepted it in principle, and will submit a formal reply tomorrow as soon as their respective governments approve it. At that time, the work of finding neutral currency experts to form a commission will begin, and they will work with experts from the four major powers to deal with the Berlin currency system issue. The compromise proposed in the new plan can break the deadlock in which Western countries refuse to conduct any negotiations under the threat of a Soviet lock.

[United Press Paris 29th] The four powers gave a tentative agreement on the 29th to the new proposal put forward by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, the President of the Security Council, recognizing that resolving the Berlin currency problem is a necessary step to end the Berlin blockade. However, according to authoritative sources, Western countries believe that Bramuglia's new proposal is just a tacit admission of the failure of neutral countries to mediate the Berlin crisis. They believe that the situation in Berlin is rapidly deteriorating, and Berlin may have already split in two before the United Nations can implement any mediation. It will take at least a month for the expert commission to study the currency problem. They believe that this is just a new twist on previous suggestions and there is no hope of resolving the Berlin crisis soon.

[United Press Paris 30th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia's term as President of the Security Council this month will expire at midnight today. The Belgian representative, Langehenhove, will succeed him as President on the 1st of next month. Bramuglia is scheduled to go to Italy on the 1st, but said that he may change his plans if necessary.

### U.S. Armored Division Airlifted to Berlin

[Agence France-Presse Berlin 29th] According to the Soviet-occupied zone's APN news agency, the U.S. authorities plan to airlift a U.S. armored division to Berlin before December 15th. Colonel Howley, the commander of the U.S. sector in Berlin, has neither confirmed nor denied this. The APN news agency's information is based on the conversation of U.S. officials at Tempelhof Airport with German workers. The U.S. authorities, in view of the difficulty of transporting heavy tanks, have decided to transport armored vehicles equipped with light weapons. Several armored vehicles have already arrived in Berlin.

### The United States, China, Britain, and France Advocate Limiting the Use of the Veto Power

Recommended to the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly

[United States Information Service Paris 29th] The United States, China, Britain, and France today submitted a joint proposal to the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly, supporting the proposal of the Interim Committee ("Little General Assembly" meets during the Second General Assembly) to limit the use of the veto power.

### Pacific Trust Territory Opens Commercial Fishing

[United States Information Service Washington 29th] The U.S. Department of the Navy announced that the rich fishing resources of the U.S. Trust Territory in the Pacific are now open to fishing vessels of all countries. The Deputy High Commissioner of the Territory is currently preparing to consider proposals from companies willing to fish in the Pacific. The area open to commercial fishing includes the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands. These islands were formerly mandated islands of Japan before the war and are currently under U.S. trusteeship under a United Nations agreement. The area covered by the sea surface is equivalent to the area of the continental United States. According to the orders of the Department of the Navy, fishing licenses will be issued by the Deputy High Commissioner of the Trust Territory, whose headquarters is located in Guam. The Department of the Navy stated that these fishing licenses will be cancelled or modified at any time if the safety or interests of the local residents are affected.

### Britain and the United States Have Reached Coordination to Solve the Palestine Problem; Britain No Longer Supports the Bernadotte Plan

[United Press Paris 30th] British and American experts revised the Palestinian mediation plan overnight last night until dawn today to prepare it for submission to the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 30th] In the amendments to the Palestinian proposal jointly put forward by Britain and the United States, representatives of both sides have reached an agreement on general principles. This is the result of a major step forward by the British representatives. The main concession made by the United Kingdom, it is reported, is the cancellation of the points involved in the Bernadotte Report. In other words, the United Kingdom will no longer support Bernadotte's final conclusions in this General Assembly. In this way, this General Assembly only needs to decide on the implementation of the Partition Plan of November 20, 1947.

[United Press Paris 29th] Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok formally submitted a note to UN Secretary-General Lie today, applying to join the United Nations. Israeli officials are confident that this application can obtain the statutory seven votes in the Security Council and a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly.

### The United States Will Conclude Anti-Regional Defense Alliances with Western Countries Within One Year, Including the Rio Treaty and the Atlantic Agreement

[United Press Washington 30th] Government officials predicted on the 30th that within the next year, the United States will conclude joint defense alliances with most countries in the Western world. This alliance includes the Rio de Janeiro Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance and the North Atlantic Security Agreement that is being brewed. Congress approved the Rio Treaty in October, which will take effect next month. This winter, the United States, Canada, and the five countries of the Western European Union will each send representatives to meet and establish the North Atlantic Agreement. The participation of the United States is subject to the approval of the next Congress. The five countries of the Western European Union (Britain, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) have drafted a proposal for the establishment of the Atlantic Treaty, which is expected to be submitted to Washington by the ambassadors of the five countries to the United States this week. The Rio and North Atlantic agreements will obligate the United States to help defend a large part of the world. This "security area" will run through the North and South Poles in the Western Hemisphere and then cross the Atlantic Ocean to reach the main anti-communist countries in Western Europe. Before the Rio Treaty takes effect, the fourteen American countries should submit their ratification documents to the Pan American Union. So far, thirteen countries have submitted ratification documents, including the United States. The fourteenth country, Costa Rica, will submit its ratification document next month. According to the Rio Treaty, if any one of the contracting states is subjected to armed attack, the other states shall consider it as an attack on their own country and shall have the obligation to immediately respond to the attack with actions that they deem appropriate. Therefore, in this situation, in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, Congress will ultimately decide whether to participate in the war.

### French Parliament Discusses the Ruhr Area Problem

[United Press Paris 30th] The National Assembly will launch a debate on the most heated issue on the 30th, which is the decision on the Ruhr area, so the government is in a difficult situation. When the debate begins on the afternoon of the 30th, members of the left and right extremes and centrist parties will question Foreign Minister Schuman on the French government's position before the Anglo-American Ruhr area becomes a reality. Due to the recent decision by the United Kingdom and the United States to allow France to participate in the management of the Ruhr area, Schuman's position is relatively easier and the government is not at risk of splitting.

### U.S. Senator Malone Flies to Bangkok for Inspection

[United Press Manila 30th] Senator Malone, a Republican senator who advocates comprehensive aid to China, left here today for Bangkok for inspection. Malone may meet with Siamese Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram and British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald.

[Agence France-Presse Bangkok 30th] British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald arrived here by plane from Singapore on the 29th. He will stay in Bangkok for a week. He is accompanied on this trip by his wife and British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East General Leese.

### Japanese House of Representatives Unanimously Passes the Amended Public Servants Law Bill

[United Press Tokyo 30th] After an all-night session, the Japanese House of Representatives passed the amended Public Servants Law bill on the morning of the 30th, which was authorized by MacArthur. The amended bill will deny public servants the right to strike and collective bargaining. The Social Democratic Party launched an offensive in the Congressional Committee to amend the amended bill to grant public servants some form of collective bargaining rights, but the committee finally passed the original amended bill by a vote of fourteen to nine, and then it was passed by the plenary session of the House of Representatives. The bill has been submitted to the Upper House, and it is expected that the Upper House will also pass the bill on the 30th.

### Doihara and Hirota File Appeals to the United States; Tojo and Others Temporarily Stayed from Execution; MacArthur Announces He Will Await the U.S. Supreme Court's Ruling

[United Press Tokyo 30th] MacArthur allowed a postponement of the execution of the death sentences of Tojo and six other Japanese war criminals on the 30th. Although only Hirota and Doihara appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, MacArthur's statement indicates that all convicts will be temporarily stayed from execution until the U.S. Supreme Court rules. However, this point is not yet completely certain.

MacArthur's statement did not clearly state whether only the two appellants or all seven convicts would be allowed a temporary stay from execution. However, since the regulations included in the appeal apply to all, it can be regarded as all death convicts will be temporarily stayed from execution. MacArthur's surprising action was issued only a few hours after receiving unofficial news here that Hirota and Doihara had filed appeals. MacArthur Headquarters issued a special communique stating, "Regarding press inquiries as to whether the execution of the convicts will be carried out before the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the appeal, MacArthur clearly replied: Not such a thing."

[United Press Tokyo 30th] Warren, the defense lawyer of Doihara, the Japanese instigator of the invasion of China, declared today that Doihara and Hirota Koki have filed appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court. (The court is scheduled to open on the 6th of this month.) He does not intend to ask MacArthur for a temporary stay of execution, but will notify MacArthur of the appeal. It would be too strange if it were executed before the Supreme Court ruled. Hirota's defense lawyer Yamaoka also said that he hopes to postpone the execution until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the appeal case. The defendant's lawyers believe that this appeal case is completely different from the cases of Yamashita Tomoyuki, Honma, and German war criminals. The defendant questioned the power of the eleven-nation organizational court to try Japanese war criminals, and questioned the charter on which the court was based. The U.S. Supreme Court should rule on the validity of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and its charter.

[United Press Tokyo 30th] Colonel Eges, a spokesman for General MacArthur, pointed out on the 29th that the appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court by Doihara and Hirota do not bind the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. He said: "According to the powers granted by the Far Eastern Commission, MacArthur is the final reviewer." The Allied Headquarters here have not received official notification of the appeals filed in Washington. Allied Headquarters lawyers speculate that if the U.S. Supreme Court believes it is necessary to suspend the execution, it must request President Truman to order MacArthur to suspend the execution.

[United Press Washington 30th] Legal circles expressed some doubts on the 30th about whether the U.S. Supreme Court can interfere in Japanese war criminal cases. They pointed out that in the past, the Supreme Court has refused to overturn the judgments of war criminals.

### 140,000 Japanese Miners on General Strike Today

### General Office of the Economic Commission for Asia Decides to Remain in Shanghai

Soviet Opposition to Discussing Japanese Issues Rejected

[Central News Agency Rabusdong 30th] The general office of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East will continue to stay in Shanghai. This announcement was made by UN Assistant Secretary-General Ait Garwin at the Commission's meeting this morning.

[Another dispatch] At the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East this morning, a proposal by Soviet representative Levinov to remove the discussion of the Japanese economic issue from the agenda was rejected. Levinov stated in his proposal that the Japanese economic issue is within the jurisdiction of the Far Eastern Commission and is not the business of the Economic Commission. Indian representative Pilai first expressed opposition. Chinese representative Li Zhuomin stated that the Economic Commission can discuss issues related to the Japanese economy, but it is not necessary to change the general policies agreed upon by the Far Eastern Commission. Australian representative Coombs and New Zealand representative Hunter also spoke out against the Soviet proposal.

### China's Gold and Silver Exports to the United States

Only Over One Hundred U.S. Dollars After 8/19

[Central News Agency Washington 29th] U.S. Department of Commerce reports: In October of this year, the United States imported nearly 130 million U.S. dollars of gold from abroad, and imported silver worth 7 million U.S. dollars. However, the value of gold bars imported from China to the United States was only 132 U.S. dollars.

This is the first time that gold and silver have been shipped from China to the United States in the weeks since the 8/19 currency reform. Usually, the United States imports about 100,000 U.S. dollars of gold and silver from abroad each month, and the large amount of gold and silver worth more than 1 million U.S. dollars imported into the United States from abroad from August 8 to early September was apparently shipped from China to the United States before August 19. At the same time, the Department of Commerce also announced that China has been allocated surplus fuel oil and oil worth 200,000 U.S. dollars, which are scheduled to be imported into China this winter.

### Living Index Up 15.4 Times; An Increase of 90% Compared to the First Half of November; All Members Attending the Editorial Board Meeting Expressed Satisfaction

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Employee Living Cost Index Compilation and Review Committee held a meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Zhang Zongmeng, the Director of Statistics of the Municipal Government, presided over the meeting and reported that the employee living cost index for the second half of November was 15.4 times the base period of "August 19." This was a 90% increase compared to the first half of November. The categorized indexes were: Food 1680, Housing 1310, Clothing 1160, Sundries 120. According to Zhang Zongmeng's report, the price increases below tenfold during this period included: cotton, fresh fish, spinach, trams, and soap, etc. Price increases between tenfold and thirteenfold included: green vegetables, sugar, electricity, coarse cloth, shirting, thread, and cigarettes, etc. Price increases between thirteenfold and fifteenfold included: tofu, matches, toilet paper, and haircuts, etc. Price increases between fifteenfold and eighteenfold included: Hsien rice, pork, and briquettes, etc. Price increases above eighteenfold included: chives, soybean sprouts, baiye (tofu skin), and fermented bean curd, etc. The index during this period was characterized by relatively low prices at the beginning of the month, followed by a sudden surge. Although prices generally declined slightly in the second half of the month, they remained at a substantial level, so the average for the second half of the month was higher than the average for the first half of the month. In addition, the adjustment of public utility prices also had some impact on the index, it was stated. After careful review by the committee members, the index was deemed satisfactory, and the meeting adjourned at 3:50 p.m.

### Labor-Management Arbitration Committee Discusses Wage Issues; Salaries to be Calculated Based on Current Index; Loaned Salaries from Last Month Temporarily Postponed for Deduction; Amendment to Interim Measures for Wage Adjustment

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee held its 23rd meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss several motions related to wage issues proposed by the General Labor Union. Representatives from both labor and management engaged in heated debates during the meeting, which adjourned at 7 p.m. Wu Kaixian chaired the meeting, and the motions were as follows: (1) Amendment to the Interim Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai: 1. Starting from December 1948, the wages of workers in all industries will be calculated and paid monthly based on the index, in accordance with these measures. 2. The legal tender base wages in April 1947, that were below 60 yuan will not be discounted. 3. For legal tender base wages in April 1947, that were between 60 yuan and 100 yuan, the 60 yuan portion will not be discounted, while the remaining portion will be reduced by 10% for each 20 yuan increment. (The base wages listed in the preceding two items refer to the legal tender base wages before conversion to gold yuan). 4. Professional workers without fixed workplaces (i.e., transient laborers) will not have their base wages discounted. 5. If the management and labor parties reach an agreement on their own due to poor production or business conditions or other special reasons, that agreement will still be followed. (2) The General Labor Union's motion requesting that all production and professional workers have their wages calculated based on the current index was resolved to approve that all production and professional workers, except those whose work is not fixed or those with agreements between labor and management or those determined by arbitration and adjudication, will be paid based on the current index. (3) The General Labor Union's motion requesting a temporary postponement of the deduction of wages loaned to employees of various factories in November due to difficult living conditions was resolved to approve. (4) The handling method for disputes over the conversion of wages to gold yuan in the local shirt industry was resolved through adjudication that the wages in that industry should be calculated based on a gold yuan base wage of 3 yuan per dozen, according to the current index. In addition, the "Standards for Wage Calculation and Distribution After the Restoration of the Living Cost Index Wage Calculation Method" were retroactively approved.

### Zhan Peilin and Zhan Yutian Declared Not Guilty by Special Criminal Court

The two brothers immediately returned home with their lawyers.

[Report from our newspaper] Zhan Peilin, chairman of the Paper Industry Association and owner of Yiji Xing Paper Store, and his younger brother Zhan Yutian, director of Yizhong Paper Mill, were accused of hoarding and speculation. Yesterday afternoon, the Special Criminal Court announced: "Zhan Peilin and Zhan Yutian are both not guilty." The reasoning for the verdict was that Zhan Peilin's storage of paper was related to his primary business and was registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. After investigation, the amount was found to be consistent, and the prices were not raised when sold, so it could not be proven that there was any hoarding or speculation. As for the stock of paper pulp in Zhan Yutian's factory, it was found to be insufficient for three months of use, so it could not be considered hoarding or speculation. After the verdict, the two defendants were entrusted to their defense lawyers, and the Zhan brothers immediately returned home with their lawyers.

### Lines for Gold Exchange Resemble Long Snakes; Flying Fortresses Maintain Order; Central Bank Requests Additional Exchange Locations

The exchanges at each bank continued until after 6 p.m., but were not yet completed. It is understood that in order to strengthen the efficiency of the exchange and improve order, the Central Bank has recently suggested to the central government that additional exchange locations be added in the city.

### Shanghai-Xuzhou Air Transport Busy; Number of Wounded Soldiers Transported Back Exceeds 10,000

[Report from our newspaper] Wounded soldiers who bravely fought in the Battle of Xuzhou have been transported by aircraft from the Central Air Transport Corporation, China National Aviation Corporation, and Chennault's Civil Air Transport to hospitals in the rear in Nanjing and Shanghai for treatment in recent days. By yesterday, a total of more than 10,000 people had been transported. The Central Air Transport Corporation began undertaking this task on November 21, dispatching an average of 10 transport planes per day, flying back and forth more than 15 times, transporting approximately 700 wounded soldiers per day. According to the company's statistics, as of November 29, a total of 6,018 people had been transported back.

### November Rice Ration Price to be Announced Today After Further Discussion; The US Insists on Pricing at 95% of the Market Price

[Report from our newspaper] According to news from the People's Food Allocation Office, the price of rice for the November ration will be announced today. Yesterday, relevant authorities held three consecutive meetings at the office of the US Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) China Mission, but a price could not be determined. This was because the US representative insisted that the rationing price should be set at 95% of the market price for the last three days of November. If this were the case, the rationing price would be 350 yuan per shih (unit of dry measure), which local authorities believed was more than 17 times the "August 19" price limit, and was clearly too high, so they insisted on finding a way to reduce it. The last meeting of the three-person committee ended around 7 p.m. yesterday, but no decision was reached, so it was changed to be discussed again today before being announced.

[Report from our newspaper] The entire first and second comfort delegations of the National Comfort Association, having completed their mission of comforting troops at the front lines in Xuzhou, returned to Nanjing and Shanghai a few days ago. Zhang Daofan and Fang Zhi, the heads of the delegation, and Chen Boliang and Ling Yingzhen, members of the delegation, held a press conference yesterday at the New Life Club to report on the progress of this trip and the actual situation at the front. They pointed out that based on the observations of the entire delegation, they believed that the National Army had already won a strategic victory in the recent Battle of Xubeng. The morale at the front was unprecedentedly high, and the emotions of the residents were unusually calm. When the war reached its climax on the night of November 17, clear artillery fire could be heard in the city of Xuzhou, but the residents continued their operations as usual, and no incidents of looting or disturbance occurred in the city. What was particularly admirable was that every night on the streets, citizens automatically assisted the army in guarding and patrolling. The close cooperation between the military and the people demonstrated the determination of everyone at the front to eliminate the bandits. They also pointed out that the government should promptly issue an order to stop the phenomenon of officials' families fleeing in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. These people usually receive high official positions and generous salaries. In times of crisis, they simply leave. The government should investigate and confiscate their property to reassure the people.

Recalling Interesting Experiences

They recounted various interesting experiences they had witnessed in the bandit suppression troops: For example, when they were comforting troops at the Wei Jiahe front, they met a soldier named Wu Yinong, who lived at 124 Haichao Temple Street in this city. He turned out to be a volunteer soldier from the former Shanghai Garrison Command. In the wounded soldier hospital, they met Feng Kunshan, who lived at 207 Xingguo Road Intersection, Qiujiang Road in this city. He claimed that he only had minor arm injuries and asked them to tell his family not to worry. He also said that as soon as he recovered from his injuries, he would return to the battlefield to avenge this defeat. They also discovered Zhang Zijun, an 18-year-old female student from Mengcheng, who volunteered to serve in the bandit suppression work in the Qiu Corps, which was a good example for women. There was also a soldier in the Qiu Corps who sneaked into the bandit camp alone and claimed that their brigade had been surrounded, urging them to surrender early. As a result, he persuaded more than 30 bandits to surrender. Other events, such as junior officers of the National Army devising plans to annihilate the enemy and bandits defecting, were well known among the people in the front.

Finally, the entire delegation also cited various new atrocities committed by the bandits in the recent battle, saying that people aged 16 to 45 in areas occupied by the bandits have recently been forced to become "bomb heroes." The method is to form a team of five or six people, tie their hands and feet together, hang grenades on their bodies, and order them to charge at the National Army positions. During the meeting, they showed photos taken from the front lines. The feet and arms of corpses all over the ground were tightly bound with cloth strips. The bandits' contempt for people's lives and their cruel and insidious nature were infuriating. Furthermore, the bandits have recently had difficulty with supplies, and the troops are eating raw peanuts to satisfy their hunger. They also have to walk more than 100 miles a day, causing resentment everywhere. In addition, Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi are at odds in the Xubeng area. Chen's bandits suffered approximately 100,000 casualties in the previous encirclement and suppression by our large troops. He accused Liu's bandits of not being able to assist friendly forces, but Liu's bandits distributed leaflets attacking Chen Yi for heroism and sacrificing comrades. These leaflets have been repeatedly found on the bodies of bandits, proving that the rifts in the bandit camp are deepening. After a little more suppression by the National Army, collapse is only a matter of time, it was said.

Fang Zhi's Speech Moved Listeners

Fang Zhi, the Deputy Head of the Comfort Delegation, said in his speech at the press conference: "This time, my brother and Head Zhang, along with representatives from all walks of life in Nanjing and Shanghai and friends from the press, went to the front lines in Xuzhou to comfort the troops, and it can be said that we have done our best. What we brought was a warm feeling of care from the people in the rear to the soldiers at the front, and what we brought back was a strong fighting spirit from the soldiers at the front in return to the people in the rear. The soldiers at the front have not failed the entrustment of the people in the rear. At the same time, I also hope that the people in the rear will not fail the hard work of the soldiers at the front." Fang also elaborated on the situation in Xuzhou, the comfort activities, the commendable and moving deeds of the soldiers, and the cruel scenes of the communist bandits, moving all who heard it.

[Another News] During this comfort delegation's visit to Xuzhou to comfort the troops, the Qiu Qingquan Corps sent a special letter to the two Heads Zhang and Fang and all members of the comfort delegation, expressing their gratitude.

### Change of Command in the Garrison District; All Circles Hold Welcome and Farewell Tea Parties

[Report from our newspaper] Fu Zhengmo, commander of the local garrison district, has recently been ordered to take up a new position. The vacancy has been announced to be filled by Wei Rulin. Yesterday, all circles in the city held a welcome and farewell tea party at the Friends of the Military Club. More than 100 people attended, including Fu Zhengmo, Wei Rulin, and representatives from all walks of life, including Pan Gongzhan, Yu Shuping, Zhang Xiaosong, Wang Zhaoquan (representing the mayor), Tang Shichang (representing Du Yuesheng), Xie Renzhao, Commander Shao of the Wusong Fortress, Wan Molin, and Zhang Yiqu. Xie Renzhao first introduced the new and old commanders to all circles, saying that in the past, Commander Fu cooperated with all parties in the city, recruiting soldiers without disturbing the people, and achieved great results. Commander Wei once served as the chief of staff of the local garrison headquarters. This time, he will be handling military service affairs in Shanghai, and he will be able to do so with ease. Then, Speaker Pan arrived temporarily due to other important business and said in his speech that the Battle of Xubeng is currently underway, and the National Army's deployment is thorough and has absolute confidence in victory, but residents in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas are listening to rumors, resulting in a psychological floating phenomenon. Pan condemned the current elements of unrest, defeatists, and those who evade reality as inappropriate. He called on the five million citizens to immediately show their determination, practice self-help, and not hope to rely on others for assistance. If everyone is determined to contribute money and effort to help themselves and the country, the declining and pessimistic atmosphere in the country will surely change, and the bandit disaster will not be a problem. The government has now established a wartime system, and it is hoped that the citizens of the city will quickly establish a "wartime mentality," grasp the belief of "have enemy, have no me, have victory, have no defeat," and the bandit army will be pacified in the near future. Finally, Pan pointed out that conscription is the only opportunity for citizens to practice "self-help." If the conscription work can be promoted smoothly with the assistance of the people, then the army will be completed, and bandit suppression will not be a problem. Then, Commander Shao of the Wusong Fortress delivered a speech, calling himself a "Shanghai doorman." He said that he was determined to guard the gateway to the city and guarantee that the bandit army would never be able to invade an inch of land. Even if there were any changes, he would coexist with Wusong and fulfill his duties as a soldier. Finally, Commanders Fu and Wei thanked everyone, and the tea party ended.

### 30,000 Draftees to Receive Military Training Starting Today; The First Phase is for Those Aged 18 to 25; Detailed Rules for the Organization and Training of Self-Defense Forces Have Been Established

The Shanghai Citizens' Self-Defense Forces, after active planning by the authorities, have established brigade headquarters in various districts throughout the city since November 15. It has also been decided that starting today (1st), draftees will be selected from each district. On the principle of not affecting their original work, they will be organized into teams and begin basic military training. The training locations will be determined based on the conditions in each district, utilizing nearby parks and open spaces. The training time is stipulated to be one and a half hours per day in urban areas and two hours per day in suburban areas. For the first five days, life education will be implemented to cultivate the spirit of military life. Starting on the sixth day, basic military training will officially begin step by step. According to the organization plan proposed by the brigade headquarters in each district, it is tentatively set that 16 draftees of the appropriate age will be selected from each bao (group of households), and one fen dui (squad) will be established for every three bao. Three fen dui will form one zhong dui (platoon). The list of trainees in each district has also been compiled. Approximately 30,000 people will participate in the first batch of training today. This training is scheduled for three months per term, and a second batch of trainees will be transferred after the term expires, ensuring that every citizen receives basic military education and thoroughly arms Greater Shanghai, in preparation for peacetime and wartime, laying the foundation for national reconstruction.

In addition, the detailed rules for the organization and training of the Shanghai Citizens' Self-Defense Force have been established and announced by the Citizens' Self-Defense Force. The following is an excerpt:

[Organization] (1) Regional organization: In accordance with Article 4 of the organization and training regulations, the city's district baojia (household registration) system will be used to organize into brigades, platoons, and squads. The first phase of centralized training in the city will temporarily consist of one squad drawn from each platoon, totaling three classes, including the squad leaders and deputy squad leaders, a total of 16 people. The bao team officer will serve as the squad leader, and three squads will be combined to form one platoon. (2) In the first phase of centralized training, all those aged 18 to 25 (except those who have reached the age of 20 and have been conscripted into regular military service) should participate in the organization. If the specified age is insufficient for one squad, then the vacancies will be filled in order of birth date and household registration sequence with those under the age of 25. The remaining draftees from the centralized training may be retained for the next term. (3) Occupational organization: Employees of party and government agencies and various units of industrial and commercial organizations, with a number of people (aged 18 to 45) below 50, will participate in the bao platoon organization of their location. Those exceeding 50 people may form an independent platoon affiliated with the brigade headquarters. Those exceeding 300 people will be organized into an independent brigade (directly under the general brigade headquarters), without age restrictions.

[Training] (1) Term: Each term of training is three months, divided into four terms throughout the year. The first term is for those aged 18 to 25, the second term is for those aged 26 to 30, the third term is for those aged 31 to 35, and the fourth term is for those aged 36 to 45, with training being convened in rotation. If a draftee is unable to participate in training during the training period due to an accident, they may postpone the training until the next term. (2) Time: Training will be given for six to twelve hours per week. The principle for draftees in urban areas is to not interfere with business hours, and the principle for factories and suburban areas is to not interfere with production.

### Evaluation of the Victory in the Battle of Xuzhou Continued from Page One

The Cost of Victory The general public in the rear is quite concerned about the results of the Battle of Xuzhou. As a result of extensive investigations by reporters at the front, it can be boldly said that the actual losses of Chen Yi's troops in this battle were approximately between 130,000 and 150,000 men. The Battle of Nianzhuang was a standard hard battle, with fierce fighting between the two sides lasting for thirteen days and nights. Huang's Corps' five armies were all elite, possessing the firepower of one hundred artillery pieces. Chen Yi's troops adopted an offensive posture, so casualties were particularly high. The battles in the west and south of Xuzhou were the steady and progressive advance of the National Army, and the losses on both sides were limited. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front also paid a price of nearly 100,000 men in this great battle to protect the Jianghuai region. Huang Baitao's Corps was the real hero in this decisive battle, fighting bitterly with an absolutely superior enemy in the small area of Nianzhuang. The enemy, based on its experience in the Northeast, used rumor-mongering and tempting broadcasts day and night to shake the fighting spirit of the National Army soldiers, but it proved completely useless. After thirteen days and nights of hard fighting, they finally salvaged the overall situation after Feng Zhi'an's defection, and finally broke through to join forces with the reinforcements. However, their sacrifice was also heavy. Of the original five armies, only five or six regiments broke through, and the rest died heroically. The other National Army units, such as Qiu's Corps, Li's Corps, and Sun's Corps, were all in high morale and accomplished their missions in the subsequent battles. The defense of the air force base in southeastern Xuzhou was defended by the 74th Army within Qiu's Corps. After successfully repelling the enemy's offensive, they were able to continue to press forward. There was only one air force base in Xuzhou. If there had been any mistakes, everything would have been lost. In the enemy's deployment for attacking Xuzhou this time, arrangements were made to first eliminate Huang's Corps, leaving the eastern flank of Xuzhou empty, seize the air force base, isolate Xuzhou from the outside world, and then concentrate all their efforts on dealing with Qiu's Corps to seize this important town in East China. As a result, their plans met with obstacles in both places, and victory belonged to the National Army.

Naturally, the greatest glory of victory should be attributed to the soldiers who actually fought; however, the quality and talent of the commanders are also decisive factors. General Liu Zhi, Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, was determined to sit in the besieged city with the determination to die this time, and did not sleep peacefully for more than ten nights. Under his encouragement, senior officers such as the army commanders went to the front line to supervise the battle in person, resulting in the unprecedented vigor of the National Army's morale in any past battle. And the one who planned strategies and commanded calmly was General Du Yuming, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. General Du was directly appointed by the highest authorities after the emergency in Xuzhou. There were many Deputy Commanders-in-Chief in the Pacification Headquarters, but they had no real power. Du Yuming's official title was "Deputy Commander-in-Chief for Operations," indicating that this deputy had the great power to command and organize battles. Du is a very talented and famous general and is deeply trusted by the authorities. Within a considerable scope, he can make decisive decisions and change the decisions of the authorities on military deployments. Originally, the mobilization and deployment of the entire Battle of Xuzhou had to be reported to Nanjing. The Presidential Office sent inspectors to each army to collect local military intelligence and materials, and submit reports and suggestions to Nanjing. During the critical situation on the eastern flank of Xuzhou this time, Du Yuming made a very decisive decision to risk withdrawing troops on the western flank, shorten the defense line, and transfer the main forces of Qiu's and Li's corps to the eastern front within 36 hours, stabilizing the slow-moving situation. Speaking objectively, if the commanders at the front can do things with confidence under their principles, and do not have to report everything and lose opportunities, then even if today's situation is fragmented, there is still hope for reversing the future.

Favorable Impact The Battle of Xuzhou has come to an end, and the center of gravity of the war has now shifted south. Whether the traffic line of the Jinpu Railway can be restored depends on the evolution of the battle between Suxian and Bengbu. If we calmly and quietly weigh the value of this victory, it is not difficult to find the following points: (1) It has dealt a blow to the enemy's morale and restored the confidence of the National Army. Because after the defeats in Shandong and the Northeast, the enemy has greatly underestimated the National Army's combat capabilities and morale, and strategically abandoned the steady and progressive approach, and even wanted to take Xuzhou and Bengbu in one fell swoop, further threatening Nanjing and Shanghai to resolve the overall situation. Now, after this setback, their confidence will inevitably be weakened, and risky actions will be reduced. As far as the National Army is concerned, the sound of retreat has been heard everywhere in recent months, which has indeed affected morale. Now, after this victory, the morale of the army has been revived. The author dares to responsibly assert that the morale of the various corps around Xuzhou is very high. As long as the living conditions and treatment of ordinary soldiers are actively improved, the present and the future will be the Great Wall of the country. Here, I would like to especially emphasize one point, that is, we cannot overemphasize the casualties of the Communist bandits, because they control a large number of militias, and replenishment is easier than for the National Army. At the same time, the unconventional strategies they use do not require soldiers to undergo long-term training. Although this victory has caused the enemy to suffer heavy losses, it has not eliminated their ability to control troops and soldiers through political work, and they will definitely make a comeback soon. (2) It affects the American psychology towards China. At the beginning of the Battle of Xuzhou, the military attache of the American Embassy traveled to Xuzhou, and the nature of this trip is self-evident. At the same time, along with the Nanjing comfort delegation, there were seven American colleagues who inquired about military intelligence in every detail and went to the front line to watch the battle in person. Can you believe that this respectable colleague is not in substance an observer from the U.S. State Department in China? As far as the reporter knows, before the end of the Battle of Xuzhou, nine out of ten Americans in China lacked faith in the National Army, believing that the victory in Xuzhou was just propaganda and that no large-scale war had actually taken place. Now, having been on the battlefield and seen all the activities of the National Army, their views have changed. The current situation is that they trust that the National Army can maintain the overall situation, which is the prerequisite for American military aid to China. The achievement of the Battle of Xuzhou is very important from this perspective. (3) It proves the success of the National Army's new strategy. In the past, for the sake of prestige, the National Army had to defend famous cities and towns, resulting in the dispersal of troops and being at a disadvantage and passive everywhere. A year ago, the consumption of manpower and materials was extremely large, which fostered the enemy's current advantage. This strategy of holding on to the death went bankrupt with the abandonment of Changchun. The National Army is now fighting under a new concept, focusing on attacking the enemy's main force rather than competing for the gains and losses of one city or one pool. The victory in Xuzhou this time is the result of abandoning Bian and Zheng and concentrating elite forces. Similarly, after the center of gravity of the war in Xuzhou shifted south, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's main forces were concentrated between Su and Bengbu, and the rear in Shandong and Henan was very empty. The National Army did not take advantage of the situation to advance north and recover Zheng and Bian and southern Shandong, but actively mobilized its main forces south to participate in the battle, which is also based on the same reason. Bengbu is close to the capital and supplies are more convenient than Xuzhou. Under the pincer attack of the Northern and Southern National Army, we have reason to believe that the southern section of the Jinpu Railway (Xupu section) will be reopened in the short term.

### Two Fires in Hongkou and Nanshi

[Report from this newspaper] A Western-style house at 27 Kunshan Road and Zhapu Road in Hongkou suddenly caught fire due to an electrical short circuit in the hallway on the second floor at around 2:15 AM yesterday. All the furniture was burned down on the spot, and the bedroom on the third floor was also affected. The fire department dispatched a hose truck to the scene and extinguished the fire after about an hour. Fortunately, no one was injured.

At around 7:00 AM yesterday, a fire broke out at Changfeng Xinji Oil Depot at 151 Xinmatou in Nanshi. Because a large amount of oil was stored inside, once it caught fire, it spread immediately. As a result, the buildings of the depot were completely destroyed and extinguished at 8:30 AM. It is reported that the losses were substantial.

### Private Schools' Second Tuition Fee Collection Should Be Fully Distributed to Employees: Education Bureau Formulates Supervision and Assessment Measures

### Limited Import Quotas in the Future Will Adopt a Key Allocation System: Sharp Drop in the Market Price of Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates

According to sources from the Import and Export Control Commission, after the implementation of the import and export trade linkage, the commission has stated that the original import quotas will still be allocated as usual and will not be reduced. However, in view of the fact that all previous import quotas were quite small in quantity due to foreign exchange expenditure constraints, but there were too many manufacturers receiving the allocation, and each manufacturer could only receive a small amount after allocation according to the ratio, this small amount of imported raw materials made it impossible for large manufacturers to utilize. Now, the commission has decided to reform the quota allocation method, abandon the policy of universal allocation, and adopt a key allocation system, so that all import quotas can be used in a concentrated manner, that is, actively support industry and commerce, and concentrate all import quotas on important manufacturers for batch utilization. This allocation method will be a great improvement compared to the previous universal allocation method.

Another report: The foreign exchange transfer certificate suddenly fell sharply yesterday. The initial price was 28 yuan, and then it fell to 27 yuan and 75 cents, which was a significant drop compared to the previous day. It is reported that the reason is that there are many rumors in the market, people are uneasy, and importers have no intention of importing goods, so the demand for foreign exchange transfer certificates has decreased, resulting in a sharp drop in the market price.

### Central Bank Stipulates Two Methods for Handling Surplus Foreign Exchange

Regarding the handling of surplus foreign exchange, the Central Bank has specially stipulated two methods, and has issued Foreign Exchange Circular No. 166 to all designated banks to comply with them as follows:

(1) For surplus funds from export foreign exchange and overseas remittances, those that have been approved by the Bank in advance may submit a foreign exchange transfer certificate of the same value and resell the surplus foreign exchange to customers.

(2) For surplus funds from import foreign exchange, such as unused foreign exchange under expired letters of credit, when designated banks repurchase them, they will be calculated at 70% of the foreign exchange transfer certificate price on the date of exchange settlement. However, for foreign exchange that was calculated according to the foreign exchange balancing committee rate during the period from May 31 to August 23, 1948, and was not accompanied by a certificate of exchange settlement of the same amount, designated banks will still calculate it according to the original exchange rate when repurchasing it. The original transaction date of the above resale and repurchase of foreign exchange must be noted item by item in the foreign exchange daily report to facilitate auditing. In addition, the Bank's Circulars Nos. 146, 149, and 155 shall be repealed immediately."

### Tightening of Monetary Conditions at the End of the Month: Shortage of Cash Notes Is Even More Severe

Due to the fact that yesterday was the end of November, the demand for funds from all parties was quite large, and the monetary situation continued to be tight. The black market interest rate was between 90 cents and 1.20 yuan, and the exchange of cash notes for gold and silver increased sharply, and the shortage was even more severe.

Another report: Yesterday, the banking authorities, in view of the fact that all parties needed cash notes, strictly restricted cash withdrawals. Each customer was only allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan from large banks and 500 yuan from small banks, but those with overnight funds could withdraw according to the deposit amount. The discount on commercial paper in the market was still 200 yuan per 1,000 yuan.

### The Cotton Yarn Cloth Management Committee Sells All Its Stock of Yarn and Cotton to the Central Bank

After the Cotton Yarn Cloth Management Committee was closed in July, the unfinished matters were continued to be handled by the Liquidation Committee. Now, the committee has been ordered to close by the end of the year, and has sold its stock of 6,000 pieces of yarn, 50,000 bundles of cotton, and 10,000 bolts of cloth to the Central Bank at a 10% discount, and is clearing all procedures. After the committee is closed, the new organization, the Textile Industry Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, will be established at the original site of the yarn management committee, and Gu Baochang will be appointed as the director.

### Frequent Negative News: Prices of Yarn and Cloth All Fall Sharply

Yesterday, the yarn market was affected by the tight monetary conditions at the end of the month and sluggish sales. Frequent negative news caused sellers to become weak. With more sellers, the market atmosphere was depressed and prices fell.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1,200 yuan as soon as it was quoted. Although it had recovered in the middle, sellers flocked in, and it ended at 11,700 yuan, a drop of 1,300 yuan compared to the previous day.

40-count Gold Test ended at 10,800 yuan, a drop of 900 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon fell by 800 yuan. 21-count Variable Horse yarn was quoted as low as 7,800 yuan at the close, a drop of 1,500 yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell uniformly by varying amounts ranging from 700 to 1,300 or 1,400 yuan.

The cotton cloth market was also affected by the tight monetary conditions at the end of the month and the dumping by northern merchants. Many floating accounts were settled. There was a general cry for selling in the market. Only Guangdong and local defense forces had some scattered demand. Quoted prices fell in a straight line.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially stood at 405 yuan, and then retreated to 400 yuan, falling all the way to a low of 375 yuan. Near the noon close, scattered short-covering pushed the price back up to 380 yuan, a sharp drop of 40 yuan compared to the previous day.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was traded at a low of 370 yuan, and recovered to 380 yuan at the noon close, a drop of 30 yuan. The prices of other cloths also fell by about 10%.

Consolidated Export Tea

Domestic tea has been selling well since the Japanese and rural merchants have been buying continuously. Yesterday, the market's appetite was still strong, and prices were also stable due to sellers' firm stance.

It is understood that the various routes in Jiaxing are currently accepting low-grade coarse tea without hesitation. As for export boxed tea, the demand from French North Africa is quite urgent, but domestic tea prices are surprisingly high, making it difficult to promote sales smoothly for a while. Transactions are still at a standstill, the market atmosphere has not been revitalized, but people's hearts are still firm, and the foothold is particularly stable.

### Sugar Market Retreats

Yesterday, the sugar market retreated because the Taiwan Sugar Corporation continued to distribute sugar, and the stock of sugar among the industry was sufficient, resulting in market saturation. However, because sales were sluggish, there was a shortage of orders, resulting in short selling on the market, and the market situation plummeted. No. 45 White Sugar initially opened at 400 yuan, and hesitated for a long time after the closing. Retail investors took the initiative to sell quickly, and people's hearts wavered, causing market prices to soften. It closed at 390 yuan, a drop of 35 yuan. Medium sugar and coarse sugar also fell by 20 to 30 yuan each, and other sugars fell uniformly by about 10%.

### Rice Prices Fall Even More Sharply: Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes Also Fall Consistently

Yesterday, the rice market saw an even more dramatic drop. Production areas continued to report price declines, and holders of goods were still selling anxiously. In addition, the tight monetary conditions caused even more sellers. Rice shops were mostly waiting and watching due to the daily decline in prices, so sales remained sluggish and prices fell sharply.

Northern Market white japonica rice was down to 355 yuan, a sharp drop of 45 yuan. Glutinous rice fell by 50 yuan. High-quality early rice was 320 yuan, and bottom-quality rice retreated to the 300 yuan mark. The Southern Market initially fell sharply by 40 to 50 yuan, but recovered slightly at the close, a drop of 20 to 30 yuan. Yesterday, 3,532 stones of rice arrived in the Southern Market, and 5,252 stones in the Northern Market.

Flour: A major price drop has begun, with the prices of various brands falling by up to 20%. There was strong selling in the market. Lao Che flour fell to 114 yuan, and Bingchuan fell to 104 yuan, a sharp drop of 20 to 26 yuan each. Miscellaneous brands of flour fell by more than 20 yuan, and bran also fell a lot.

Miscellaneous Grains: Prices fell across the board, and sales turned sluggish. Soybeans fell by 5 to 10 yuan, and corn fell by about 5 yuan. Sesame seeds fell slightly by 10 to 20 yuan, and raw peanuts fell by 40 to 50 yuan.

Edible Oil: Prices fell sharply, and there were few buyers. Factories also offered a lot. Soybean oil closed at 660 yuan, a drop of nearly 100 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 530 yuan, a drop of 70 to 80 yuan. Soybean cake also fell by 7 to 8 yuan.

### Sluggish Actual Sales of Woolen Fabrics

Winter overcoat wool and long-haired velvet have some sales outlets, and prices are relatively stable. Domestically produced and Hong Kong-imported woolen fabrics have sluggish sales, and retail prices are all trending downwards. Feather yarn, sleeve lining, and Western cloth linings are mostly stable. Herringbone woolen cloth, halifax cloth, and four-ply women's colored woolen cloth are all trending weak. Biji continued to fall due to the stagnation of customer demand, and the same was true for Valdini. Grass green woolen gabardine has seen a decline in sales, but vendors are unwilling to lower prices excessively.

### The Hong Kong Government's New Attitude: Will Expel Elements Resisting Allied Nations

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Zhi Ji

[Report from Hong Kong, 28th of this month (via airmail)] London, 25th - Reuters reports: British Colonial Secretary Jones, in response to a question from a Member of Parliament, stated that the activities of the Chinese Communists in Hong Kong were being closely monitored. He also said that they were preparing to expel those Communists who were attempting to use Hong Kong as a base to resist the governments of allied nations. The National Daily here revealed that while Hong Kong officials declined to comment on Jones' statement, sources familiar with the matter stated that the Hong Kong authorities had directly and indirectly warned the rebellious elements residing in Hong Kong who oppose friendly nations' governments, instructing them to restrain their actions and not to exceed their status as political refugees. The sources also pointed out that this was the first time the British government had openly acknowledged the activities of the Communist Party in Hong Kong. The government's resolute preparation for this firm action may be a result of Hong Kong Governor Sir Alexander Grantham's return from the Singapore conference. While officials stated that this was a routine meeting, various reports have revealed that the conference discussed the issue of anti-communism, with particular emphasis on the activities of the Communist Party in Hong Kong. Observers here generally believe that the Hong Kong authorities' attitude towards the Communist Party will, at the very least, revert to the pre-war policy.

Expelling Communist Activities from Hong Kong

Following the release of the aforementioned telegram, various Hong Kong newspapers widely published it on the 26th. Due to the official British statement that "it is closely monitoring the activities of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong and is preparing to deport several Communist Party members," newspapers in Hong Kong with political leanings prominently featured reports from their respective reporters interviewing Hong Kong government officials on the first page of the Hong Kong news section on the 27th. However, the three long-standing newspapers in Hong Kong, Kung Sheung Daily News, Wah Kiu Yat Po, and Sing Tao Daily, remained entirely aloof, refraining from any exploration of the matter.

Anti-China Activities Will Not Be Tolerated

The "New Life Evening Post" here provided the most detailed exploration of this issue, quoting extensively from statements by Hong Kong government spokespersons and the Commissioner of Police. However, the Hong Kong government declined to disclose the identities of the Communist Party members to be deported but stated that they might be deported back to the Chinese Communist areas. The New Life Evening Post reported that Hong Kong Police Commissioner MacKenzie stated that he would not reveal the names or deportation dates of the Communist Party members mentioned in the aforementioned telegram. When asked by reporters if he had a complete understanding of the matter but was simply keeping it a secret, MacKenzie smiled and said, "That is correct."

Names of Those Being Deported Not Disclosed

The Hong Kong government's Director of Information Services, Hogan, provided a more detailed explanation of the matter. He told the newspaper's reporters that the Hong Kong authorities did not wish to participate in the affairs between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists, but they also could not allow anyone in Hong Kong to undermine any friendly governments. Therefore, any actions by Communist Party members using Hong Kong as a base to oppose the Chinese government would not be permitted, as the Nationalist government was the regime currently recognized by Britain. Similarly, if the Kuomintang were to use Hong Kong to oppose the Soviet Union, it would also be prohibited, as the Soviet government was also recognized by Britain.

He said, "Hong Kong cannot be used by the Communist Party as an anti-government base in order to avoid putting Hong Kong in a difficult situation."

Regarding the details of the case involving the Chinese Communist Party members mentioned in the aforementioned telegram who were to be deported, Hogan also declined to disclose any information, but he emphasized that their deportation was only due to specific incidents. He responded to reporters' inquiries by saying that the deportation would be carried out by police officers and they would be sent back to the Chinese territories.

### Chengdu Officials and Citizens in Lawsuit

[Report from Chengdu, 27th of this month] Amidst a severe housing shortage, the Chengdu municipal government recently lost a lawsuit concerning the lease of property. The municipal government, lacking a fixed location, had leased a house from Shi Zhaowu, a deceased famous Sichuan gentry and military figure (Shi was Liu Wenhui's adopted son and was killed by Liu Xiang in 1936), to use as its offices. The lease expired last month, leading to a dispute over renewal. The landlord, Shi Dihua, moved his entire family into the municipal government building, occupying all offices and the auditorium, bringing the entire municipal government to a standstill. Chengdu Mayor Qiao Cheng then sued Shi in the local court for obstructing official duties. After several investigations, the court ruled that Mayor Qiao's charges were unsubstantiated and dismissed the case against Shi. Shi Dihua then countersued the municipal government for infringing on his property rights. The local court has accepted the case, subpoenaed Mayor Qiao, and ordered the municipal government to relocate. Currently, the mayor's office has been turned into a bedroom, the auditorium into a kitchen, and no one is working, bringing municipal affairs to a halt. The municipal government plans to reclaim the city's Zhongshan Park to build its own office space but is opposed by tenants and the Municipal Assembly. The mayor, despite his high position, is busy dealing with the housing shortage day and night.

### Parricide Case in Cheng: Wang Guiliang Interrogated

[Report from Jiangyin, 26th of this month] Wang Wuding, a farmer from Beijie, Yunting Town, east of Jiangyin, had his wife, Liu, who was fifty years old, adopt his nephew, Wang Guiliang, as their son because they had no children of their own. Wang Guiliang worked in a yarn factory in Shanghai. He had resigned and returned home to farm in July of this year. Last month, he had an argument with his adoptive mother over cooking oil and loans. On the night of the 23rd, another argument broke out, and Wang Guiliang strangled Liu with his hands, causing her death.

### Communism in China September 1948 Compiled by the U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities

— Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper

This report is the third section of "National Studies," Supplement Three of the report "Strategy and Tactics of World Communism" compiled by the Subcommittee on National and International Movements of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee. It provides a detailed and objective account and analysis of the origins, characteristics, historical background, development process, relationship with the Soviet Union, U.S. attitude, and importance of China to the world based on factual materials. The original was published in September of this year, and it also mentions our recent currency reform, which proves the novelty of its sources.

When discussing the historical and social background of the Chinese Communist Party's development, this report points out that civil wars and international wars in agricultural countries are directly and indirectly beneficial to communism. However, it emphasizes that China is the only major power capable of maintaining cultural independence and cannot be conquered or divided by any external force. The report criticizes Mao Zedong's "New Democracy" from various perspectives and explains the reasons why it cannot be applied to China. When discussing the recent developments of the Chinese Communist Party, the report acknowledges its expanding influence and the possibility of the entire country turning red if it wins the civil war. However, it points out the various weaknesses of the Chinese Communist Party itself and states that if the world is willing to make efforts and has determination, the ultimate success of the Chinese Communist Party can still be curbed. Finally, it forcefully argues for the importance of China in world affairs and its relationship to the fate of peace and war in the world, advocating that the United States must cooperate with China and provide it with military, economic, and political assistance.

The domestic situation has evolved to a critical juncture. Madame Chiang Kai-shek is flying to the United States to appeal for aid to China, and the White House is closely monitoring the development of our country's situation in order to decide on a policy of aid to China. This report has been reviewed by U.S. Congressman Judd and other experts on Chinese affairs, and their opinions and criticisms are valuable for reference. Therefore, we have specially translated the entire text of each chapter, either in full or in part, according to the importance of the content, and will publish them in this newspaper daily. The entire text is divided into five chapters as follows: (1) China and Communism; (2) The Birth and Growth of Chinese Communism; (3) The Second United Front; (4) The Second Civil War; (5) The Importance of China.

(1) Preface

1. Chinese Communism is orthodox Communism. Its doctrines follow those of Lenin and Stalin. Its leaders have been trained in Moscow. Its policies and actions, its strategies and tactics, are of the Communist Party type. For more than thirty years the Chinese Communist Party has faithfully followed every twist and turn of the Kremlin's road.

The debate about the nature and true meaning of Chinese Communism in the United States has been greater than that about the Communism of most other countries in the world. The debate occurred among scholars and critics and was reflected in public opinion and the policies of the United States government. But today there is clear evidence that there is no need to continue the debate.

2. China itself is one of the centers of human culture in the world, with a history of three thousand years. China is a vast country, and its profound culture has made it strong enough to conquer its neighbors and annex its short-term conquerors. It is the only major power that has never been swallowed up by Western politics. China today is encountering the shock of two forces, Western science and industry, not gradually accepting them over the four hundred years since the European Renaissance, but suddenly and all at once. The politics of China in the past was more like the politics of the Middle Ages than the politics of modern Western countries. China has been forced to try modern democratic politics without the preparation of hundreds of years of constitutionalism and legislation. China has not yet enjoyed the peace of a modern nation-state.

3. Communism first appeared in China shortly after the Russian Revolution. Soon after, Comintern advisors followed and began to instill Communism into China and adapt it to the conditions of this non-industrial country. From then on, the history of Chinese Communism can be divided into the following four periods or stages:

1923 to 1927 - The First United Front Period.

1927 to 1937 - The First Civil War Period.

1937 to 1946 - The Second United Front Period.

1946 to... - The Second Civil War Period.

4. China has been used as a testing ground for the development of modern Leninist Communism. Since the Russian Revolution, Communism has faced two worlds: on the one hand - the West, which are the major industrial countries. Marx's "Das Kapital" was used as a diagnosis and a prediction for them. Among these countries, Germany was considered the country with the best chance to promote Communism. Before the Hitler era, the German Communist Party was listed as the pioneer of Communist parties in countries other than the Soviet Union. On the other hand - the East and the South, on most of the land in Asia, Africa, and South Africa, live three-quarters of the world's population. Most of these nations are industrially backward, have low levels of education, lack resources, and are politically naive. The Kremlin gradually took notice of these countries and discovered many good opportunities in them. As in the Soviet Union in 1917, these countries lacked democratic systems established on a long-standing foundation and were more suitable for promoting Communism than the industrialized countries of the West. In order to infiltrate this three-quarters of the world's population, China was used as a laboratory and testing ground. The Chinese Communist Party has maintained the status of the Kremlin's eldest daughter in this second world.

5. Communism in China has from the beginning exploited the surge of national patriotism and the anti-imperialist movement. At the same time, the early Communist Party in China also took the first advantage, that is, the early national movement in China had no precedents or past experiences to judge the consequences of cooperation with the Communist Party. It was not until 1927, when the Communist Party saw that China's victory and unity were tending to stabilize, and thus exposed their intention to turn China red, that the Chinese Kuomintang broke off relations with them, and then the first civil war began.

6. During the ten years of the First Civil War, the Communist Party gathered in an area, established a Soviet system, and launched a fierce defense against repeated attacks by the National Army. Finally, in 1935, they moved to Shaanxi Province in the northwest, seized an area, and established a government.

7. When Hitler's arrogance was high and Japan intended to invade, Moscow was eager to have Japan cause trouble in China, and then the Second United Front was formed. The Chinese Communist Party used its usual tricks of hypocritical patriotic propaganda to repeatedly demand the restoration of the national united front to resist Japanese aggression. In 1937, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept the requirements of this Second United Front, beginning an eight-year war that exhausted all of China's strength and gave the Communist Party an opportunity to recuperate.

8. The theoretical and propaganda guidelines of the Communist Party during the Second United Front period are published in Mao Zedong's pamphlet "New Democracy in China," published in 1940. The publication of this pamphlet served two purposes: first, to clearly explain to the Chinese Communist Party how to maintain the movement to seize dictatorial power; second, to use clever words to embellish the propaganda story, so that patriots would see it as patriotic, neutralists would see it as neutral, and liberals would also see it as liberal. Because any high-ranking Communist Party member knows that when the word "democracy" is used in Communist Party documents, it means the dictatorship of the proletariat, and most liberals do not know this secret, so this ambiguous trick is not as difficult as you might think. Although the era of writing this pamphlet has passed, the Communist Party has used it for many years as a very effective propaganda tool.

9. The Second United Front did not officially end until the beginning of the Second Civil War, but there was a very important transition period before this. The Soviet Union's participation in the war in the Far East accomplished something that was previously impossible, which was the Soviet Union's large-scale intervention in the Chinese situation. After the National Government troops occupied North China and Northeast China, they were destroyed by the dual pressure of transportation difficulties and the Communist Party's and the Soviet Union's interference. At the same time, the remaining weapons of the Japanese army were secretly flowed into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party to some extent. When the United States abandoned its mediation of the Chinese civil war and (erroneously) persuaded the National Government to accept the method of forming a coalition government with the Communist Party, the Communist Party prepared to re-launch the civil war with resources several times greater than before. In this way, the Soviet Union could move in as a wartime ally, quickly overturn the balance of power of the Chinese army, and then withdraw, re-launching a campaign of exclusion and anti-imperialist propaganda against the United States.

10. Communism in China has already gained many advantages. It can use the sudden national movement at any time. At least after 1926, it has used the opportunity of war. After 1927, it was able to control the land without bearing any national responsibilities. It organized its own Red Army. These conditions made the strategies and policies of Chinese Communism suitable for all economic and political problems. Its handling of the land problem illustrates its seemingly plausible claim to "solve" problems under these conditions. The Communist Party's control of any rural area is bound to cut off the countryside from the cities, and give the land of rich farmers to poor farmers. Therefore, it is easy to win the trust of these poor farmers, without causing a reduction in production. They do not have to deal with the entire problem, because they have only plundered or destroyed cities and machines up to now. They do not have to bear practical responsibility to the Chinese government, but rely on the state of war and destruction to feed themselves.

11. Chinese Communism has its advantages and its weaknesses. For twenty years, it has had no way to gain broad support from Chinese cities. It has always implemented irresponsible economic methods in the economic poverty of the countryside, and the inappropriateness of these methods is already very obvious. The National Government's firm refusal to join hands with the Communist Party, and the difficulties encountered by the Communist parties in Eastern Europe, ultimately stripped away its "New Democracy" mask and revealed its original intention of red dictatorship. But most importantly: China's problems can never be solved by the methods used by the Soviet Bolsheviks. Due to the lack of opportunity to develop vast lands, the population problem limits economic and political means, and within this limited scope, the Communist Party cannot achieve anything. This certainly cannot prevent them from vying for power, but they must pay an amazing price to obtain it.

12. The United States' mediation was based on the assumption that democracy and communism could be reconciled, which was the basis for efforts to establish a coalition government in China after World War II. At the same time, there is another assumption, that is, the meaning of the word "democracy" when applied by the Communist Party is the same as when we apply it. In Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, the word "democracy" has been exposed as a guise to impersonate "dictatorship of the proletariat". A coalition government under the cover of "New Democracy" only makes the work of seizing power easier. But before seeing this clearly, the United States made unprecedented efforts to help China establish a coalition government. Since then, many countries have tried the system of Communist Party participation in a coalition cabinet; the result has either been a Communist Party dictatorship or the expulsion of the Communist Party. The Chinese government's refusal to accept the Communist Party's conditions was clearly correct.

13. There are many signs to show that China has its own inherent resources, which China can use to save itself. Leaving aside the city's firm resistance to Communist forces, the literacy movement and local economic and social reform movement promoted by Yan Yangchu and Hu Shi, and many other experimental movements, have opened up a correct path to arouse and promote the vitality of the people. General Fu Zuoyi's recent efforts in Beiping have proved that some parts of these ideas have been applied to practical plans and have achieved promising results.

14. Whether for world communism or democratic and peaceful forces, China is a testing ground for fifteen billion people in the world to develop and test their path forward. The problems that need to be solved include technology and industrial problems. Economic issues, social issues, domestic security issues, and foreign political security issues, and finally, how to become a truly democratic political issue. China cannot solve its economic problems without assistance. China cannot solve the problem of domestic security caused by the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese Communist Party's instigation of civil unrest without military assistance. Moreover, China cannot enjoy foreign political security without the support of the United States and the United Nations. For more than thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party and the International Communist Party have always cooperated, seeking ways to make China a Communist Party dictatorship. If you want to solve the problem of how to make China a modern democratic country, it is best to solve it jointly by China and the United States. China's destiny will ultimately determine the destiny of Southeast Asia and the world.

I. China and Communism

A. Is it Communist Party type or Chinese type?

Communism in any country in the world is unique to that country in some sense. The Communist parties in any country are mostly natives. They speak the local language, read local newspapers, live local lives, eat local food, and play local games. The Chinese Communist Party is Chinese type, and Chinese communism is Chinese type.

Communism in any country is still communism. The meaning of 回回教（Hui Hui Jiao, Islam in Chinese） is obvious and well known to everyone. Similarly, whatever country's 美以美敎會 (Mei Yi Mei Jiao Hui, Methodist Church in Chinese) is still the Methodist denomination, and whatever country's Roman law is still Roman law, and chemistry is chemistry. In short, anything that people in more than one country have in common in their lives that transcends the characteristics of one country is a common thing. They come from the same source, and they can last for decades or hundreds of years without declining, relying on the preservation of books, and then being passed on and innovated. The people who live on them have learned them, and then spread them to others. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party is Chinese and also the Communist Party. Their leaders are tainted with the thoughts of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. They are familiar with Moscow's analysis of modern culture, the prediction of the Communist Party's future strategy, and the orders to guide the Communist parties in various regions to adopt the current actions.

For many years, one of the most important tests of Communist Party training has been following every twist and turn of the global Communist Party line. This test distinguishes Communist traitors from loyal believers. Most of the current Communist Party leaders have been selected through this test. When the Comintern adopted the Popular Front line in 1935, the Chinese Communist Party also followed this line. From 1937 to 1939, Moscow supported the Chinese National Government in resisting Japan. The Chinese Communist Party participated in the United Front and faithfully fulfilled its duties to China. From 1939 to 1941, Moscow referred to the European war as an imperialist war and adopted an isolationist attitude. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party relaxed its resistance to Japan and strengthened its activities to seize power. After June 22, 1941, simultaneously in Moscow and Yan'an, the imperialist war became a war for freedom and democracy. After that, the Chinese Communist Party resumed its offensive to seize power in China. When the Soviet Union and China signed a friendship agreement in 1945, the Chinese Communist Party was quiet for a few months. In 1946, when it saw that the United States would not temporarily support the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party immediately openly launched a civil war. No Communist parties in the world have a better position than the Chinese Communist Party.
