### No More Fighting in Jinan, Inside or Out; President Declares a Deadline for Recapture; He Yingqin Reports on the War Situation at the Kuomintang Central Political Committee; Air Force Fleets Continue to Bomb the Periphery of Jinan City

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] President Chiang personally presided over the Kuomintang Central Political Committee on the morning of the 27th. After Minister He Yingqin reported on the war situation, the President spoke impromptu, expressing regret over the loss of Jinan, considering it a significant loss in the suppression of the rebellion, but one that would not affect the overall military situation in the suppression campaign. The President also declared that he would immediately issue an order to recapture Jinan by a specific deadline. He's report focused on the Jinan and western Liaoning battlefields. The Jinan campaign resulted in substantial losses due to Wu Huawen's unexpected defection as the primary cause. General Wang Yaowu's loyalty and bravery were extraordinary, but news is currently cut off, and his fate is unknown. However, based on the circumstances, it is believed that Wang may have committed suicide to die for his cause. Fierce fighting continues on the western Liaoning battlefield. In addition to the military report, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shishun reported on Foreign Minister Wang's attendance at the United Nations General Assembly and China's position.

[Central News Agency, dispatch from Xuzhou, 27th] According to an Air Force reconnaissance report, there has been no fighting inside or outside Jinan City since the afternoon of the 26th, and the city appears to have fallen into the hands of the bandits after a bloody battle. However, according to observers here, the fall of Jinan is merely the prelude to a major battle in central Shandong. National troops are currently advancing towards central Shandong in multiple directions according to prearranged plans, and a major battle may break out in early next month. It is widely believed that Chen Yi's bandit forces will suffer even more severe blows than in the Yellow River flooded area.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 27th] The Air Force's Huanghai fleet flew to Jinan in batches on the 27th, severely damaging the arsenal, Jingyi Road, ammunition depots, commercial port, and Daxin Pharmaceutical Factory in the northern part of Jinan City. All bombs hit their targets, sending up thick smoke.

### Guangdong Province Proceeds with Hong Kong Exchange to Purchase Rice; Song Ziwen Explains the Process; Declares That Everything Is Done with Public Funds for Official Purposes; If Any Acts of Using Public Office for Private Gain Are Found, The Death Penalty Will Be Applied

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 27th] Before the currency reform, the Guangdong Provincial Bank successively entered more than 590,000 Hong Kong dollars to purchase Siamese rice for allocation and sale, which caused some misunderstandings. Especially recently, people in Nanjing and Shanghai did not understand the truth, and spread rumors. Chairman Song Ziwen specifically issued an important statement, stating: Guangdong is a rice-deficient province. Last year, it suffered a flood that had not been seen in sixty years, and production was sharply reduced. This year, there is a risk of famine. Since he took office, he has purchased a large amount of grain from Hunan and Guangxi, and cooperated with US aid and grain allocated by the Ministry of Food to safely overcome the province's serious food crisis. However, there is still a shortage of food next year, and Hunan Province also suffers heavy flooding and prohibits the export of rice. In August, when he went to Nanjing, he was granted by the Ministry of Food to allocate 20,000 tons to this province within the 100,000-ton quota of rice purchased by our government from 暹. However, the central government could not provide foreign exchange, and Guangdong Province had to prepare its own foreign exchange for procurement, and it had to be purchased before the end of October this year. After he returned to Guangzhou on August 10, the Grain and Economic Committee entrusted the Guangdong Provincial Bank to successively replenish the foreign exchange entering Hong Kong. During the initial replenishment, the currency reform decree was announced, so only more than 590,000 Hong Kong dollars could be replenished, equivalent to 720 billion legal tender, which has been verified by the Guangzhou Gold Management Bureau. This is all done with public funds for official purposes. If there are any acts of private gain, which are not purchased by the Provincial Bank with grain loans, any acts of using public office for private gain, once found to be true, will be punished according to law with the death penalty.

After research, it was considered inappropriate to purchase short-term Treasury bills, which will be changed to only purchasing Gold Yuan public bonds. In addition, the use of these funds for production enterprises will be limited to direct production and may not be used for loans. When there is an urgent need for turnover, the funds should still be deposited in the Central Bank after the turnover is completed. This use will only require the approval of the Central Bank.

### Editorial: The Berlin Crisis's Appeal to the UN General Assembly

The world's attention has been focused on the Moscow negotiations, which, after more than a month of continuation, finally failed due to the Soviet Union's insistence on controlling traffic to Berlin. After receiving the Soviet reply to the three powers' "final note," the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France held an emergency meeting at the French Foreign Ministry. They unanimously believed that the Soviet Union had refused to lift the blockade of Berlin, and that the blockade of Berlin had created a situation that "threatened international peace and security." Therefore, they decided to appeal this serious Berlin crisis to the United Nations Security Council. Although this move was expected by the world, and UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie had already been considering "requesting the Security Council to discuss the Berlin crisis," this is the first time that the Security Council has handled a dispute between the five major powers, and whether it can resolve this issue is related to the prestige and survival of the United Nations. The third session of the United Nations General Assembly is currently being held at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, and although it is still regarded by the world as a symbol of world peace and the only hope of mankind, it is surrounded by a haze, indicating the dimness of its future. Now, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have appealed the Berlin crisis to the General Assembly, putting the United Nations to an unprecedented and severe test.

In our honest opinion, in the past three years, the United Nations has indeed eliminated a lot of hatred, discrimination, disputes, and wars from the post-war world. In particular, the Security Council has been more successful than it has failed. For example, the mediation of the Indonesian-Dutch conflict, the Indian-Pakistani dispute, and the Palestinian-Arab war must be said to have achieved considerable success, saving billions of people from the scourge of war. However, it must also be pointed out that the nature of the United Nations, its life, is entirely entrusted to the principle of "unanimity of the five powers." Therefore, the five permanent members of the Security Council all have the privilege of exercising the "veto power." If any one of the five powers expresses dissent and exercises its veto power, any resolution cannot be established. Therefore, the Security Council can only resolve issues that are less related to the five powers, and cannot resolve serious issues that are directly related to the interests of the five powers. The Security Council's handling of international issues over the past three years is an excellent demonstration of this. Now, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, regardless of the nature of the Security Council, have actually appealed the Berlin crisis to the General Assembly, accusing the Soviet Union of violating the Charter. Apart from causing a great uproar in the United Nations General Assembly, whether the Security Council can resolve this issue is, as everyone knows, uncertain.

The fact before our eyes is very clear. If the United Kingdom, the United States, and France bring the Berlin crisis to the Security Council for handling, the Soviet Union will inevitably exercise its veto power, making it impossible for the Security Council to pass any resolution. Even if this General Assembly decides on any method to restrict the exercise of the veto power, the Soviet Union will inevitably fight to the end to oppose it. In the event that the countries disregard the Soviet Union's opposition and pass a resolution to amend the United Nations Charter, the resulting outcome will inevitably lead to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the United Nations. Therefore, from any perspective, it is meaningless for the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to appeal the Berlin crisis to the United Nations. It only adds a major difficulty to the United Nations, forcing the East and West blocs to face off in the United Nations General Assembly.

As for the creation of the Berlin crisis, from the perspective of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the communist forces are increasingly tightening their grip to the west, and the Soviet Union has also blockaded traffic between Berlin and West Germany, which is really intolerable, so it is necessary to force the Soviet Union to lift the blockade. From the Soviet Union's perspective, the merger of the three occupation zones of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the conclusion of the West German agreement, and the reform of the West German currency system are all expressions of anti-Sovietism and anti-communism, and the blockade of Berlin must be used to counteract its effects. Standing in the position of a third party, we cannot help but say, "Each has its own reasons." The crux of the problem is the difference in thinking and the conflict of interests between the two sides. The Moscow negotiations failed after more than a month because the two sides insisted on their own positions and could not tolerate or concede to each other. As long as both sides have sincerity, opening the deadlock in negotiations is not impossible. Therefore, we believe that instead of appealing the Berlin crisis to the United Nations, it is better to seek a peaceful solution through diplomatic negotiations. Now, the international situation is critical. Western democratic countries still need greater perseverance and patience, and they must especially cherish the United Nations, which is still a symbol of world peace. Unless it is absolutely necessary, they must not force the Soviet Union to withdraw, making the United Nations only an international organization of the Western bloc. Therefore, the decision of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to appeal the Berlin issue to the United Nations is worth reconsidering.

### Bevin's Speech Responds to Vyshinsky, Denouncing Soviet Harm to Peace, Questioning the Motive Behind a Three to Four Million Strong Army

[United Press Paris, 27th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, on the 27th, challenged the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly, demanding that the Soviet Union "show its sincerity" by revealing the true strength of its armed forces. Bevin accused the Soviet Union of professing a desire for peace while everything it did in Germany showed that its words were empty. He added, "The threat of psychological warfare is hanging over our heads." Bevin then demanded that the Soviet Union "produce the facts, give us proof of sincerity." Bevin's speech was mostly aimed at Soviet representative Vyshinsky's speech to the General Assembly last week, in which the latter claimed that the Western nations were plotting an atomic war against the Soviet Union and insisted that the Soviet Union's intentions were entirely peaceful. Bevin, turning towards Vyshinsky, exclaimed, "The Soviet Union's actions belie its words!" Bevin's speech came just hours after the West issued its strongest post-war diplomatic note to the Soviet Union, announcing that the West had decided to submit the Berlin crisis to the Security Council. Although Bevin did not specifically mention the Berlin crisis when discussing Germany, he expressed regret that the Soviet Union had refused the U.S. proposal in 1946 to sign a forty-year treaty to permanently disarm Germany. In response to Vyshinsky's proposal to reduce the armed forces of the five major powers by one-third within a year, Bevin said that no one knows the true strength of the Soviet Union's armed forces, and that only common security and confidence could promote reductions. "Mr. Vyshinsky obviously disagrees with me, so let him tell us the truth about the Soviet Union's armed forces." Bevin said, "We have learned that the Soviet Union's armed forces currently number at least three to four million people. I believe that before the war, this number was less than one million. Now, a country that is unwilling to declare its actions to the world and wants us to trust it with our security is simply not credible. In my opinion, the Soviet Union's proposal is like asking the whole world to disarm while the Soviet Union continues to conceal its military strength." The British Foreign Secretary firmly supported the Western European Union and the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan), and denied that these two agreements were aimed at the Soviet Union. "If we cannot unite the world as one family based on ideals, we must seek the next best thing, focusing on regional cooperation. We should consult with those who share our views and cooperate with those who understand and trust each other and are willing to understand and trust us." Bevin believed that a world government, which is what the world yearns for, could emerge from regional understanding. Regarding Vyshinsky's claim that the West was preparing to wage war against the Soviet Union, Bevin denounced it as "pure fiction" and "completely unfounded." He said, "What then is the purpose of the Soviet Union's psychological warfare? Mr. Vyshinsky need not answer. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union wants to trap our minds in its web. We are the ones taking a defensive stance, and we are the victims of the 'Cold War' launched by Moscow."

### If Atomic Catastrophe Descends, the Soviet Union Will Be Solely Responsible

Bevin assured the Soviet Union that it need not fear Western attacks on Soviet territory and could enjoy peace. "We will never attack the Soviet Union. On the other hand, if the Soviet Union, after stabilizing its own country, uses the territory of other countries to prepare to attack us, a difficult situation will arise, and we will have to make plans for our own defense." He solemnly warned the world that if the world is engulfed in atomic war, the Soviet Union will be solely responsible. Regarding the United Nations' lack of achievement in controlling atomic energy, Bevin said, "I wish to state in the most solemn terms that if the catastrophe of the atomic bomb descends upon the world, all the disasters suffered by mankind should be borne entirely by one country, because that country refuses to cooperate with other countries for the sake of human happiness in controlling and developing atomic energy." Bevin also questioned whether the Soviet Union still adheres to the Marxist-Leninist view that there can be no final agreement between communist and non-communist countries. He asked whether all the actions of the Soviet government are merely a tactic, whether the Soviet government's words are appealing during the process, but its ultimate goal remains unchanged.

Citing Lenin's Words

At this point, the stout British Foreign Secretary quoted Lenin as saying that the ultimate victor would be either communism or the "capitalist countries," and that "before the end comes, there will be a series of terrible clashes between the Soviet Republic and the bourgeois states." Bevin asked, "We have been slow to accept the Soviet Union's rhetoric of international cooperation at face value. Mr. Vyshinsky should understand why in light of Lenin's words." Bevin became emotional when mentioning Vyshinsky's claim that the West was plotting an atomic war against the Soviet Union, pointing his finger at Vyshinsky and exclaiming, "This is an age-old trick. Those who accuse others must themselves have this intention and shift the responsibility to others."

Thunderous Applause

Bevin's speech was met with thunderous applause. Veterans of the General Assembly said that this was the most well-received speech in recent memory. Vyshinsky left his seat immediately after Bevin's speech, and many other chief delegates followed suit.

### The Soviet Union Should Bear Sole Responsibility for Creating the Serious Situation in Berlin: The Three Western Powers Jointly Send a Note to the Soviet Union and Simultaneously Submit a Copy to the United Nations

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 27th Broadcast: It is expected that the United States, Britain, and France will submit a copy of their note to the Soviet Union regarding the German question to the United Nations on the 27th, along with an urgent request to include the case on the Security Council's agenda within a few days. The note was delivered to the Soviet ambassadors to the United States and France on the night of the 26th and was sent to London on the 27th to be delivered to the Soviet ambassador to Britain.

[French News Agency Paris, 27th] The United States, Britain, and France delivered a twelve-page note to Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov at midnight on the 26th (Paris time). The note includes the following thirteen points: (1) The Soviet Union's measures in Berlin to obstruct the Western powers' supply of occupation forces are sufficient to threaten Berlin residents with starvation and economic ruin. (2) The Western powers cannot accept measures that infringe on their rights in Berlin but are prepared to accept practical measures that are consistent with their rights and obligations in Berlin.

(3) During the Moscow negotiations, an agreement was reached on lifting the Berlin blockade and placing the Soviet mark under four-power control. (4) Stalin stated that all restrictions mentioned on June 18 would be lifted, and the Four-Power Financial Committee would have the right to control the German banks in the Soviet zone, as these banks are related to the business of the entire city of Berlin. (5) The instructions given by the four-power governments to their four military governors in Berlin were based on the results of the meeting with Stalin, but the Soviet commander in Germany did not comply with these instructions. He demanded restrictions on the Berlin airlift and refused to recognize the Financial Committee's right to control the issuance of banknotes. He also demanded that trade between Berlin and other areas be placed under Soviet control. (6) The Soviet authorities allowed demonstrations aimed at overthrowing the Berlin municipal government. (7) On September 14, the representatives of the three Western powers drew the Soviet government's attention to the fact that the Soviet commander in Berlin had not paid attention to the Moscow agreement. (8) In its note to the three powers on September 14, the Soviet Union still supported the position of its commander in Berlin regarding the powers of the airlift, trade, and financial committee. (9) On September 22, the three powers asked the Soviet government whether it intended to remove the Berlin blockade, stating that if the Soviet Union disregarded the previous agreement and decided to harm the rights of the three Western powers in Berlin, then continued negotiations would be pointless. (10) The three powers considered the Soviet Union's reply on September 25 to be unsatisfactory. The Soviet Union made conditional concessions on the control of Berlin, and its promises to control air transport and trade permits were deceptive. The Soviet government wanted to regain control of air passenger and cargo transport, which indicated that the Soviet Union had the right to restrict air transport between Berlin and the Western zones. If air transport was at the Soviet Union's disposal, then the Soviet Union could implement a blockade at any time in the future. (11) The recent encouragement by the Soviet commander in Berlin to overthrow the Berlin municipal government and his attitude towards negotiations proved that the Soviet government had not implemented the agreement and wanted to harm the rights of the three Western powers in Berlin. (12) The Berlin problem is not a technical problem. This proves that the Soviet government is attempting to achieve its political goals by illegal means, in other words, attempting to seize complete control of Berlin's economic, political, and social life and merge it into the Soviet occupation zone. (13) In this situation, the Soviet Union should bear full responsibility for the situation that cannot be resolved by invoking Article 33 of the United Nations Charter. This situation is creating adverse consequences that threaten peace and international security. Therefore, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, in order to maintain their rights in Berlin, are currently taking measures that they deem necessary to maintain their position in Berlin. They feel obligated to submit this action by the Soviet government to the United Nations Security Council.

### The Berlin Problem Will Be Presented to the Security Council on Thursday; We Support the Western Position

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 27th Broadcast: The French representative to the United Nations Security Council, Parodi, stated on the 27th that if current arrangements can be completed smoothly, the Western powers will present the Berlin problem to the Security Council this Thursday. According to reliable sources, the United States and Britain will relinquish the presidency of the Security Council when the Berlin problem is presented. The British representative, Jebb, is serving as president of the council for September, and the U.S. representative is scheduled to assume the presidency in mid-October.

[United Press Nanjing, 27th] Well-informed sources told United Press on the 27th that China will fully support the Western bloc when the Berlin dispute is submitted to the United Nations. They said that China is unlikely to adopt a "neutral" attitude in this matter, as it is extremely important in the escalation of the Cold War between East and West, especially since this Cold War has recently spread to Southeast Asia.

### U.S. State Department Publishes White Paper, Revealing the Breakdown of Negotiations; Soviet Union Violates Promises and Disregards Diplomatic Credibility

[United Press Washington, 27th] The U.S. State Department released a 24,000-word "White Paper" on the 27th, detailing the fruitless four-power negotiations on the Berlin problem and how the Soviet Union broke Premier Stalin's guarantee to lift the blockade. At the same time, the United States, Britain, and France have submitted the Berlin problem to the United Nations and jointly sent a note to the Soviet Union, believing that the Berlin problem is a definite threat to world peace.

The "U.S. White Paper" is the longest and most complete record of any negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. It emphasized the fact that the Soviet Union had agreed in principle to lift the blockade, but the Soviet military governor in Berlin "took a position contrary to the clear assurances given by Stalin in Moscow." No official explanation has been given for the Soviet Union's sudden change of attitude. However, it is obvious that this was either because Stalin rescinded his guarantee or because the all-powerful Soviet Politburo overturned Stalin's order.

The State Department's White Paper stated that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and the British and French envoys emphasized "the extreme danger of the Berlin situation" at their first meeting with Stalin on August 2. At the end of the four-hour meeting, the three Western powers believed that a solution to the Berlin dispute could be reached because Stalin had made it clear that the Soviet Union had no intention of "driving the Allies out of Berlin." However, this optimism disappeared during several meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. When negotiations were on the verge of failure, the Western powers again sought a meeting with Stalin, which was held on August 23 at the Kremlin. At this meeting, progress was made in the negotiations, and an agreement in principle to lift the blockade was reached a week later, with the "technical issues" being left to the four-power military governors in Berlin to study.

The White Paper described the circumstances of Stalin's proposal of the above agreement at this meeting carefully and in detail. The document stated that before Stalin withdrew, Ambassador Smith specifically used this opportunity to raise a clear and definite question, hoping to obtain a precise explanation of the Soviet Union's position. Stalin then agreed to issue instructions to the Soviet military governor in Berlin to lift all restrictions on the Western powers. "Based on this understanding, which was personally confirmed by Stalin, instructions were finally issued to the four-power military governors in Berlin to draft a technical agreement.

After the negotiations moved to Berlin, the Western powers immediately discovered that Soviet military governor Marshal Sokolovsky was not prepared to implement the understanding reached in the Moscow talks. Moreover, he not only did not reduce the restrictions on land transport, but also added new restrictions to the existing air transport. Therefore, Marshal Sokolovsky in Berlin took a position completely contrary to the clear assurances given by Stalin in Moscow on the three issues of transport restrictions, currency, and trade. Moreover, he constantly expressed many attitudes that were insignificant to the success or failure of the negotiations. The one-week technical discussion in Berlin was even more fruitless than the one-month negotiations in Moscow.

After several subsequent Moscow meetings that had no hope of success, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France sent notes to the Soviet ambassadors in their respective capitals on September 22, asking the Soviet Union to answer "whether it is prepared to immediately lift the blockade measures." However, the Soviet Union evaded the question in its reply on the 25th and instead blamed the Western powers for the failure of the negotiations, claiming that "establishing the Soviet occupation forces' control over air cargo and passenger transport is as necessary as controlling railway, waterway, and highway transport." The secret negotiations between the four powers, which began on July 30, finally failed. This showed that the West's attempt to ease tensions between East and West through secret diplomacy had come to an end.

The process of the four-power negotiations on the Berlin problem as cited in the White Paper is as follows:

July 20: U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith visited the Kremlin and suggested "a frank and open review" with Stalin and Molotov of the possibility of lifting the Berlin blockade.

July 21: Western envoys met with Molotov separately to attempt to meet with Stalin in person.

August 2: First meeting with Stalin. Smith pointed out that the situation in Berlin was "extremely serious," but the Western countries "did not want" to believe that the Soviet Union intended to drive the Allies out of Berlin. Stalin asserted that this was not the Soviet Union's purpose but believed that the Western countries no longer had the legal right to occupy Berlin. He claimed that the blockade was necessary because the Western countries planned to establish a West German government and introduce West German currency into Berlin. Stalin suggested removing the Western currency from Berlin and gradually lifting all traffic restrictions in Berlin. The United States, Britain, and France believed that the Berlin crisis could be resolved.

August 6, 9, 12, 16: After holding several meetings with Molotov, attempting to draft an agreement based on the principles discussed with Stalin, optimistic hopes faded.

August 23: Second meeting with Stalin. An agreement was reached in principle. Stalin said that the Soviet Union did not object to the Western Allies remaining in Berlin, and the Western Allies could share the control of the German government in Berlin with the Soviet Union. After the four-power military governors in Berlin studied the technical issues, the blockade could be lifted. Stalin also agreed to instruct Marshal Sokolovsky to lift all restrictions on the Western countries.

July 31: Technical discussions began in Berlin and continued for a week, but Sokolovsky was clearly unwilling to implement the understanding reached in Moscow. During the consultations, he not only did not reduce traffic restrictions but also increased them. In addition, he also canceled the four-power control of currency.

September 14: The three governments complained bitterly in a supplementary memorandum to Stalin and Molotov. The memorandum specifically pointed out that there was no mention of restricting air transport in the Moscow meeting and instructions. The memorandum also notified the Soviet Union in an irritating tone that "the purpose of the instructions was to lift restrictions, not to add new restrictions."

September 18: The Soviet government replied to the Western countries, claiming that they had "distorted" the instructions and that Sokolovsky was completely accurate. The Soviet government also cited the so-called resolution of the Berlin Control Committee of November 30, 1945, to support its demand to control Berlin air transport.

September 22: The Western countries firmly stated that they could not accept any restrictions imposed on air transport and asked the Soviet Union to clarify whether it was prepared to lift the blockade in order to "create possible conditions for continued negotiations."

September 25: The Soviet Union replied to the three countries, believing that the agreement reached in Moscow must be implemented and insisting that "air transport cannot but be controlled."

September 26: The Western countries notified the Soviet Union that they had submitted the Berlin problem to the United Nations Security Council to "prevent further crises of international peace and security."

### Authorities Strictly Prevent Gold and Dollar Flight, Conduct Surprise Checks on Train Passengers, Factory Manager Detained with $30,000 USD, Sent to the Gold Control Bureau for Interrogation, Over 30 Cases Uncovered, All Ordered to Exchange

[Report from our newspaper] To cooperate with economic inspection work and prevent the outflow of gold and US dollars, yesterday morning, station master Li Ruhe led more than a hundred railway police officers, along with stationed military police and stationed personnel of the Suppression and Reconstruction Brigade, to conduct surprise general inspections of passengers on the Victory and Express trains. They uncovered over 30 cases of carrying US dollars out of the country, totaling more than 30,000 US dollars. The largest case involved 30,000 US dollars, found in a suitcase carried by a passenger wearing a light blue suit on the Express train. Due to the large amount, the railway police detained the passenger and took him to the police station for questioning. He claimed to be Wei Jiaxiu from Jinan, Shandong, the deputy manager of the Xuzhou branch of the Baoxing Flour Mill in Shanghai, and that the US dollars were being brought from the Shanghai factory to the Bengbu branch. When asked about their purpose, he was evasive and unable to answer. Considering the significant suspicion, the railway bureau consulted the supervisor's office and, at 1:30 PM, transferred the person, the money, and the case file to the supervisor's office of the Central Bank. Supervisor Jiang approved the transfer to the Gold Control Bureau for interrogation. Other passengers carrying dozens or hundreds of US dollars were persuaded by the inspectors to exchange their foreign currency for gold yuan at the Central Bank, and the railway bureau provided them with ticket refund benefits. (Note: Regulations for reserved-seat trains such as the Victory and Express trains do not allow ticket refunds.) Tang Wengeng, an employee of the Nanjing Materials Factory under the Second District Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, who was returning to Nanjing by train, was also found to have two US dollars hidden on his person. Because the amount was too small and he did not want to delay his journey, he asked the railway police to exchange the two US dollars for gold yuan and donate them to a charity. The railway bureau police station immediately sent the money to the Caohejing Orphan and Refugee Relief Center in the afternoon. Another high-ranking diplomat stationed abroad also presented 220 US dollars, entrusting the inspectors to exchange them for gold yuan, and the police station issued a receipt, allowing him to claim the funds in the future. Afterwards, according to a spokesperson for the railway bureau police station, the railway bureau had never previously conducted general inspections of passengers. This time, after repeated discussions between police station chief Wang and the inspection personnel in charge, it was decided to adopt surprise inspections. Under the premise of not hindering the convenience of passenger travel, these surprise inspections will be carried out at any time in the future. Starting from the first of next month, if anyone is found to be carrying gold or US dollars out of the country, in addition to the confiscation of the gold and US dollars, the carrier will be transferred to the supervisor's office for severe punishment without leniency.

### Suspicion of Smuggling US Dollars Out of the Country, Hu Hao Flees Shanghai to Hong Kong, Authorities Unable to Arrest

[Report from our newspaper] The Economic Management Supervisor's Office in this city confirmed at 7:00 PM yesterday that Hu Hao (i.e., Hu Weizhi) had already flown to Hong Kong in the early morning. Personnel from the office stated, "The supervisor's office issued an arrest warrant for Hu Hao at 10:00 AM, on suspicion of smuggling US dollars to Hong Kong. However, Hu Hao had already flown to Hong Kong in the early morning, allowing him to escape. The circumstances are quite complex, and the relevant authorities are now trying to bring Hu Hao to justice."

Permission Obtained for Trip to Hong Kong

It is learned that Hu Hao's departure from Shanghai to Hong Kong, in terms of formalities, had been previously applied for a permit from the Garrison Headquarters by Zheng Yuangui, the acting manager of the Shanghai office of Tiger Balm Wing On Tong, who has been arrested. The reason given was "Mr. Hu Hao, the general manager of this company, has completed his work in Shanghai and is returning to Hong Kong." After review by the headquarters, it was approved on the 20th of this month, with a validity date until yesterday. Therefore, although Hu was questioned and inspected by the inspectors stationed at the airport before boarding yesterday morning, he was still able to leave calmly due to having complete paperwork. After Hu left Shanghai, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) immediately sent the stub of the permit to the Garrison Headquarters for cancellation. At about 10:00 AM, the police station received an arrest warrant and sent personnel to arrest him for interrogation. By this time, Hu had already left for two hours. Afterwards, the police station summoned Qin Shuxian, the deputy director of the CNAC ticket office, for questioning.

No Name on Passenger List

Furthermore, after this news spread, someone called CNAC to inquire whether Hu Hao had left Shanghai. However, according to the company, there was no person named Hu Hao on today's passenger list to Hong Kong. Whether Hu Hao used another name to board the plane, or whether there was another problem with the permit, has become another mystery.

Original Stolen Goods Not Missing

(Another report) Yesterday's newspaper reported that when the original stolen US dollars were counted after being retrieved from the custody of acting manager Zheng Yuangui, it was discovered that 185 US dollars were missing. Yesterday morning, after section chief Jiang handed over the total amount to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for a second count, there were no shortages, indicating that the initial count was done in haste and was incorrect. After confessing to the theft, Zheng was transferred by the branch office to the District Prosecutor's Office in the afternoon for investigation.

[Another report] According to sources, it was reported that Hu Hao's younger brother, Hu Wen, intended to bring 29,000 US dollars to Hong Kong when he flew to Hong Kong on the 24th. However, due to strict military and police inspections at the time, he did not take them. Soon after, the US dollars were reported stolen. The circumstances are quite suspicious. According to the relevant source, this may be a pre-arranged diversion. However, according to Wing On Tong yesterday, the person who flew to Hong Kong on the 24th was not Hu Jiao, but Hu Hao's youngest brother, Hu Yihu, and he had no intention of taking money out of the country.

### Cigarette Retailers Request Direct Delivery

[Report from our newspaper] Hundreds of cigarette retailers recently jointly submitted a petition to the Economic Management Supervisor's Office stating that wholesalers often sell the goods themselves after receiving delivery allocations. Therefore, they request that in the future, goods be delivered directly to retailers, hoping that Yongtaihe can deliver 5,000 "White Tin Package Tai Qianmen" cigarettes per period per store, and Huacheng Tobacco Company can deliver 20 cartons per store per period.

### Three Cases of Price Gouging Uncovered, Persons in Charge Detained

[Report from our newspaper] The economic police uncovered three cases of price gouging yesterday: (1) Jiu Fu Hao at 465 Henan Road, (2) Tongli Motor Company on Middle Xizang Road, (3) Xin Mingen Store at 15 South Xizang Road.

[Report from our newspaper] Zhou Peiyun, a resident of Baoshan and a merchant not formally engaged in the flour business, recently borrowed the premises of the Huaxin Instrument and Stationery Factory owned by his friend Gu Qingfeng to hoard 229 bags of flour, waiting for higher prices. On the 14th of this month, the Changshu Road police branch received a report and went to investigate. After being handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation, Zhou claimed that he was indeed a merchant formally engaged in the flour business.

### Crackdown on Gangs, Yarn, Rice, and Flour Prohibited from Leaving the City, Chiang Ching-kuo Inspects Various Markets

[Report from our newspaper] The Economic Management Authorities took various measures yesterday to stabilize the prices of daily necessities such as rice, oil, vegetables, cloth, and yarn. Chiang Ching-kuo, accompanied by Cheng Yi-kuan, the captain of the Economic Investigation Brigade, personally inspected the vegetable and oil-rice markets at 9:00 AM, instructing merchants to consider the overall situation and abide by price limits.

### Yi Da Chang Money Exchange Operates Illegally, Ordered to Close and Revoke License, Managing Director and Manager Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office

According to news from the Gold Control Bureau, Yi Da Chang Money Exchange in this city was found to have established secret accounts and concealed income during the bureau's previous audit, violating regulations. The bureau reported this to the Ministry of Finance, which ordered the board of directors of the exchange to replace the responsible personnel and imposed a fine of 2,106,000 yuan. The exchange then replied that the deputy director of operations and the accountant had been replaced, and the fine had been submitted. The Ministry of Finance then ordered the bureau to continue to pay attention to the exchange's operations at any time to see if there were any further illegal operations. On the 19th of this month, the bureau secretly sent personnel to seize all the evidence of illegal activities, including more than 16 taels of gold, one gold bracelet, two diamond rings, eleven secret ledgers, and a written statement from Yan Dayou, the managing director of the exchange, and He Jinyuan, the manager, guaranteeing the operation of secret accounts. After detailed review by the bureau, it was found to have violated Articles 17 and 43 of the Banking Law, Articles 6 and 10 of the Measures for Strengthening Financial Operations, and Article 29, Paragraph 2 of the Measures for Streamlining Finances and Strengthening Economic Control, as well as Article 1 of the Regulations on Punishment for the Purchase and Sale of Gold and Foreign Currency. The bureau reported this to the Economic Control Supervisor for approval, ordering the exchange to close immediately, suspending its clearing of checks from the 28th of this month, revoking its exchange number, setting a deadline for clearing creditor and debtor rights and obligations, and reporting to the ministry to revoke its business license. The responsible parties in this case, Yan Dayou, the managing director of the exchange, He Jinyuan, the manager, and Chen Renben, an employee, have been sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action.

Serious Circumstances, Severe Investigation

According to Director Lin of the bureau, the simultaneous punishment and closure of the three banks of Datong, Dagong, and Nongshang and the Tongyi Trust Company was unprecedented in Shanghai. This was considered several times beforehand, because the economic control policy was just beginning. In order to prevent chaos, management had to be strict, but the licenses were not immediately revoked. A decision on whether to resume operations will be made depending on the severity of the illegal circumstances determined by the court and the quality of the liquidation. The Yi Da Chang Money Exchange case is serious, especially since it continued to violate the law after the currency reform. Therefore, it was decided to investigate severely and report to the Ministry of Finance to revoke its business license.

### Automobile Gasoline Conservation, Review Committee Meeting Today

### The Zhoushan Islands Campaign, Nine Warships Deployed, Clearing and Suppressing Each Island, Many Plunder Captured, Hospitals and Factories Discovered on the Mountains

[Report from our newspaper] The bandits' weapons and local forces of the Second Security Corps colluding with the bandits captured during the campaign by Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing to personally suppress the bandit dens in the Zhoushan Islands have been escorted to Shanghai by the Zhonghai and Zhongji warships. The Headquarters of the First Naval District specially invited the press to visit yesterday. Most of the captured bandits are local natives. Among them, Wang Hesheng, the deputy commander of the bandit maritime defense brigade, Diao Quanyou, the company commander, and Huang Weiluan, the instructor, were in higher positions. When asked how they became bandits, they either claimed that they had no means of living or falsely claimed that they were forced to participate. According to the bandit documents seized, their designation was "Zhoushan Islands Guerrilla Detachment Headquarters, East Sea Guerrilla General Team." The commander was Xu Xiaoyu, the deputy commander was Li Zhaoxiang, the general team leader was Jiang Zhiming, and the political director was Xiao Hua. All four of these bandit leaders had already fled to other places about 20 days before the suppression. The bandit maritime defense brigade commander Wang Rongxuan below the general team level was executed on the spot after being arrested. He Xiangchen, a colonel battalion commander of the 3rd Guard Battalion of the Naval Headquarters who commanded the landing and suppression of the bandits, reported the process of the suppression, stating that the forces participating this time included two platoons of the naval guard battalion, one company of the Marine Corps, and one battalion of the Army's 202nd Division. Nine warships and landing craft participated, including the Zhongji, Zhonghai, Yongxing, Liangguang, Xinyang, Meisheng, and small gunboats Fang 1, Fang 4, and Hai 7. They departed from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 8th of this month and arrived at Dongfushan, where the main force of the bandits was located, at dawn on the 9th. They immediately surrounded it and, under the cover of naval artillery fire, forcibly landed. The bandits stubbornly resisted from high ground, and after fierce fighting, the island was completely occupied at 3:50 PM. Hospitals, small factories, and large amounts of stored food were discovered on the mountain. Then, the bandits on the Changtushan, Daishan, Qushan, Waiheng, Changbaishan, Xiushan, and Dayushan islands in the Zhoushan Islands, which were occupied by the bandits, were successively suppressed, and all were occupied by the 25th. In this campaign, 185 bandits were captured, along with 3 light machine guns, 131 rifles, 19 pistols, and 1,216 rounds of ammunition. Many documents relating to communication with the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu and the "Shao" character flag that could be used to travel to northern Jiangsu were also seized.

### Sale of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate: First Batch to be Announced Tomorrow; He Hao Ruo Clarifies Government's Determination to Expedite Handling; Original Residents Given 10-Day Priority Purchase

[Our Newspaper Report] He Hao Ruo, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Industries, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 26th to oversee and expedite the handling of enemy and puppet properties. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, he convened a meeting at the Central Bank conference room, inviting relevant authorities including Jiang Jingyuan, Liu Yiyun, Cheng Yuanfan, Luo Meizhong, Li Lixia, Shen Guanya, and Zhang Zihe. The following decisions were made: (1) The first batch of 79 enemy and puppet real estate properties, totaling over 100 buildings, will be announced for sale tomorrow (29th). Original residents will have a 10-day priority purchase period, after which the properties will be openly auctioned. Original residents must vacate before Double Tenth Day (October 10th). Failure to purchase or vacate will result in enforcement. (2) The order of sale will be: (a) Garden villas, (b) Warehouses and buildings, (c) Lane houses. Furthermore, Mr. He hosted a reception for the local press at the National Bank conference room yesterday afternoon and returned to Nanjing last night. Mr. He listed five points during the discussion, excerpts of which are as follows:

Finding an Outlet for Idle Capital

(1) Expediting the sale of enemy and puppet properties is an economic method to find an outlet for idle capital. (2) Selling enemy and puppet materials can reduce idle capital and stabilize prices. In Shanghai alone, enemy and puppet properties allocated as reserve for the Gold Yuan are valued at US$41,108,890.94. If sold entirely, it could recover 164,435,563.72 Gold Yuan.

Selling Garden Villas First

(3) The government's current handling method, as decided by the Executive Yuan's 9th temporary meeting on September 25th, is as follows: 1. Enemy and puppet real estate will be valued at market price, and residents will be notified and given 10 days to purchase. They must pay half of the guarantee deposit, with the remainder to be paid within one month from the date of notification. Failure to pay on time will result in forfeiture of the guarantee deposit. Failure to purchase within 10 days will be considered a waiver, and the property will be put up for open bidding. 2. Once enemy and puppet real estate is sold, residents must relocate within one month to allow for handover to the winning bidder. Those who delay will be forcibly evicted by the Economic Supervisory Office. According to this method, we will start with the garden villas of large and wealthy households. Although all people are equal before the law, we must start with those who are powerful and in high positions. We believe that no one will neither purchase nor relocate. If there is such a person, whether they are a military or government official, a powerful merchant, or a social celebrity, we will follow the government's regulations and have military police throw their belongings onto the street, evict their families, and enforce the order. This is a government decree, and it is not the intention of the enforcement agency to be malicious. When dealing with enemy and puppet properties, we must consider civil servants and ordinary poor people who are currently living in enemy and puppet properties with diligence and frugality, sacrificing for the country, and who are helpless. We hope to handle this in a reasonable and lawful manner.

It's a Good Investment

(4) Purchasing enemy and puppet properties is a good investment and helps the government to reduce idle capital, stabilize prices, and benefit the general public. (5) The government is determined to handle enemy and puppet materials legally, reasonably, openly, and quickly. I am ordered to oversee the handling of this business and will complete the task regardless of any difficulties. It has been decided to convene a meeting of responsible persons from various regions in Nanjing on October 1st, and invite personnel from relevant agencies to participate in an open review. In addition to visiting Pingjin, Qingdao, and other places for guidance, I will also come to Shanghai every two weeks to listen to opinions from all parties. I hope that public opinion organs will supervise, and the media will assist.

### City Council Cash Group Revises Transportation Company Share Offering Method

### Huang Zongyi and Other Traitor Cases: Suzhou High Court Investigates Yesterday

[Our Suzhou 27th Dispatch] The case of Huang Zongyi, Huang Baozhen, Zhang Qiangsheng, Ning Yupei, Chen Jusheng, and other traitors from the Shanghai Pudong Huazhong Alcohol Factory was investigated by the Shanghai High Court for over a year, but no conclusion was reached. Recently, the Ministry of Justice ordered the transfer of jurisdiction to the High Court here for continued investigation. This afternoon, Prosecutor Li Shudong summoned the defendants and related individuals Li Pengqing, Liu Niangu, Luo Weilian, Chen Fuzeng, Qu Qingqiu, and Yu Zhikuan to court for the first hearing, which lasted three hours. The defendants were released on bail pending trial.

### Legal Tender Bondholders Call for Higher Redemption Rate

Legal tender bondholders in this city believe that legal tender bonds and foreign currency bonds are both national debts, but the Executive Yuan's handling methods treat them very differently, which is unfair and unreasonable. In addition to jointly appointing representatives to petition the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan to improve the situation, they also hosted a press conference yesterday afternoon to make a public appeal. According to Song Xiemingjiu, chairman of the bondholder representatives, the Executive Yuan's announced handling method for national debts stipulates that the principal and interest of legal tender bonds that have already been drawn will be redeemed at a rate of one legal tender to one Gold Yuan. The principal of bonds that have not been drawn will be redeemed in advance at a multiple, and the interest coupons of bonds that have not been drawn will be handled in the same way as the principal and interest of bonds that have already been drawn. All legal tender bondholders believe that this method is too unreasonable. Finally, he also expressed absolute support for the authorities' economic reform policies, but hoped that the government would continue to use 5.5 trillion Gold Yuan to reorganize the national debt and improve the redemption rate of legal tender bonds based on the principle of reorganizing national debt, by changing all foreign currency bonds to be redeemed according to the "August 19th" National Bank exchange rate (i.e., 487,000 legal tender to one US dollar) to maintain public confidence and show fairness.

### Stable Rice Prices, Stalled Flour Market

Yesterday's arrivals were 2,203 stones in the South City Market and 1,119 stones in the North City Market, totaling 3,322 stones in the two markets.

Flour

Trading is difficult to develop because factories only allocate sales to retailers, and wholesalers have no goods to obtain, resulting in no goods being supplied to the market, and the market is at a standstill. In addition, the flour allocation method has been changed to once every three days, for 60 bags, which is equivalent to 20 bags per household per day.

Miscellaneous Grains

Firm sales, arrivals are becoming scarcer, resulting in few suppliers. Soybean prices stand at the limit, trading is quiet, and raw peanuts have slightly increased trading.

Cooking Oil

Soybean oil factories have slightly opened up, and prices have increased by 5 jiao. Raw vegetable oil is at its highest price of 46 yuan, also up 5 jiao. Raw oil remains stable throughout. Soybean cake customers are purchasing, and factories are opening at 4 yuan 6 jiao, 100 pieces per household.

### On the View of Poetry

— Ji Yong

"Seen horizontally, it's a ridge; seen sideways, it's a peak; the view of a mountain differs from near and far." Although this saying points out how easily one can be misled, it still offers some standard. Something that appears as a ridge from one perspective might not necessarily be so from another. The eye's perception of objective reality holds some degree of accuracy. However, when it comes to poetry, the matter becomes far more complex. If you see a ridge, I might insist on seeing a peak, and I could argue with you from my own standpoint, even scolding you. And if we both agree on "ridge," others might scold us for simply buzzing around like flies following someone else's trash. Look, "Li and Du's poems have been passed down for ages, yet now they feel stale," "forecasting five hundred years of novelty, by a thousand years it feels old!" That's the limit! This "novelty" leaves us ordinary people utterly helpless.

Whether your own poetry possesses novelty is a separate issue. In fact, if your work lacks "freshness," you're unlikely to find patrons and might as well plaster it on the outhouse wall. My point here concerns our perception of other people's, even ancient, poetry. To discern a glimmer of novelty, regardless of whether that novelty genuinely reflects the "original intention" of the ancients or others, and to articulate it convincingly enough to win others over—that's a real challenge. I've studied Chinese literary history for a couple of decades, and it always boils down to the same old stuff: "Jiao Han and Dao Shou," "Du Ling's poetic history"—stale grains and rancid oil, day-old fried dough sticks, utterly lacking in "new flavor"! Even literary critics merely copy passages from Biographies of Literary Figures, Biographies of Confucians, Poetry Talks, Lyric Talks, and Literary Criticisms. In the past, Chinese poets or scholars often wrote a volume or two of ××Xuan ××Zhai Poetry Talks on the side, as a kind of "tailpiece" to their collected works. These mostly consist of rehashing what others have said, or of praising fellow disciples, flattering friends, or promoting relatives. The renowned Suiyuan Poetry Talks, while containing some worthwhile points, are also sickeningly effusive in their praise of female disciples. Some even promote themselves, which is even worse. If we, in literary history or criticism, treat these works as definitive sources, we're bound to produce something of little value!

Recently, I read Wen Yiduo's Miscellaneous Essays on Tang Poetry, which finally satisfied my long-felt craving. He absolutely refuses to parrot clichés, just to fill space and count the words as an essay. Nor does he copy and quote extensively from old books, add a beginning and end, say a few trivial things, and then consider it his own monumental work. In his "The Self-Redemption of Palace Style Poetry," we can see how poetry evolved from the Six Dynasties to the Tang. What role did Liu Xiyi, Zhang Ruoxu, and Lu Zhaolin play in the early Tang style? Saying it this way is vastly different from Chen Zi'ang and Wei Zheng's usual way of teaching early Tang poetry. Even among the Four Paragons of the Early Tang, he discerns differences and points out the inappropriateness of lumping together two groups with different personalities. These discussions don't use the traditional method of stuffing knowledge into your head like a textbook, but rather lead you with emotion, compelling you to follow his train of thought. When poetic criticism reaches this level, it can be said to be a good poem in itself. And in his two short pieces on Meng Haoran and Jia Dao, we seem to see the "untamed spirit" of old Mr. Meng living the life of a recluse on Deer Gate Mountain in Xiangyang. I suspect Mr. Wen, being a fellow Hubei native, feels a special affinity for him, and thus transforms this poet "discarded by an unwise monarch" into something of a celestial being? The Jia Dao piece begins with great humor, analyzing the poetic schools of the mid- and late Tang as a private school with several teachers and students, some cursing in the streets, others diligently preparing for the big exams, and still others grumbling, all in a heated state. The former Buddhist monk Jia Langxian allows these dazed fellows to rest in the shadows, and thus he triumphs.

In traditional literary history, we always regret never seeing such "superior meaning." I think the study of Chinese literature is almost reaching a point of feverishness. We should take off our hats, let the breeze cool us, open the high-quality paper windows that past poets and critics have pasted for us, take a breath of fresh air, and look at what color the clouds are in the sky and what kind of flowers and trees are on the ground, instead of being like dwarfs watching a play, simply echoing the lengths of others—but one thing: to do this great work, you must at least be a poet with ideals and analytical abilities, and you must put in a great deal of effort.

### Xie Die Shan's Fortune-Telling Booth

— Lü Mengjiao

After the defeat at Anren, Mr. Xie Die Shan retreated to Jianyang, selling fortunes to support his mother, but he always placed a hemp banner and cried facing east, for he never for a moment forgot revenge. The city stele still exists, this poem is a record of this.

Deep the years of resentment in the southern sky,
His hair dishevelled as he faced east,
Each day torrents of tears fall,
The city hides one who does not know their grand ambitions.

### Magpie Bridge Fairy - Night at Xuanwu Lake

— Huang Shaohong

Orchid oars like scissors, lotus leaves like covers, seagulls float in the green ripples in pairs. Riding the wind halfway to the sky, lightly, do not enter the cold Guanghan palace. Songs and flutes in the clouds, human tears, who awakens to the rise and fall? The courtyard is already unbearable to hear, let alone singing in the quiet back courtyard.

### The United Nations General Assembly in Paris

— Jing Wen

The Third United Nations General Assembly was officially opened on September 21st at the former site of the Chaillot Palace Museum in Paris. Based on the experience of the past three years, the world has been disappointed in the ideals initially embodied by the United Nations organization. Even this session, given the current international backdrop, will likely end with everyone leaving in disharmony after a battle of words. However, the realization of an ideal, especially an ideal of human harmony, naturally involves many difficulties and obstacles. As long as humanity does not lose its belief in lasting world peace, then, despite the many shortcomings of the United Nations organization today, it is still an ideal worth pursuing for humanity.

The Chaillot Palace Museum is the largest and most modern building in Paris, covering ten acres and directly facing the famous Eiffel Tower. Although France was impoverished after the war, it mobilized 3,000 workers in mid-May to work day and night on renovations and remodeling to prepare the venue. The entire venue can accommodate 1,500 delegates from various countries, 1,300 secretaries and other staff, as well as an even larger number of journalists and photographers from various countries.

The French people are naturally excited and proud that this great international conference is being held in their country. Based on the acronym of the United Nations conference in French, they call it "Onusia," and in fact, they regard the United Nations as an independent country within the city of Paris.

The order within the "territory" of "Onusia" is maintained by 50 United Nations police officers from Lake Success. French police only maintain traffic and general order outside the "territory." Apart from the participating French delegates and French guests, the only French public officials allowed to reside within the "territory" of "Onusia" are 20 firefighters. French police can only enter the "territory" when urgently summoned by the United Nations Security Council. These police officers are specially selected in advance, and each must know at least one or two foreign languages.

During the conference, "Onusia" has its own bank, post office, travel agency, press office, and even a small temporary hospital. On both sides of the conference hall are interpreter rooms, where they can translate each person's speech into various languages and broadcast it. On the other side are broadcast, telephone, and electric typing rooms.

The telephone room has 23 operators managing 2,400 telephones and can connect with delegates' home countries. In the basement of the venue is a printing house that can print two tons of paper per day, equivalent to 10,000 books. The venue also sets aside 800 seats each day for visitors.

For such a large-scale conference, the issue of food is naturally very important. The Paris authorities have specially built a restaurant on the Trocadéro Square that can accommodate 1,000 guests, with four bars attached, offering all kinds of famous cigarettes and wines, and of course, the famous French champagne is indispensable.

### Gleanings from East Java

— Xian Si

The US government, due to the high cost of building materials, built two paper houses in Wisconsin, using paper substitutes for all materials, which were carefully researched by many scientists. These two houses have now been built for four years, and have been through frost, rain, and various weathers without any damage.

US science is trying to use milk as fertilizer and has achieved great success. It is said that the soil after using milk has improved greatly, and the produced yams and onions are far more numerous than the soil that has not been fertilized with milk. Some areas in the US countryside produce too much milk, and because the freight is too expensive to export, it may be used as fertilizer in the future.

Police dogs have a keen sense of smell, but they often make mistakes. Therefore, when investigating evidence in US courts now, the instructions of police dogs must be supplemented by other evidence, otherwise they will not be adopted.

In 1930, a new device was installed in two widely separated buildings in New York City. When making telephone calls in these two buildings, the caller could see the face of the other party by wireless electricity. The cost of this equipment is very high, so it has not been popularized to this day.

### The Historical Records Possesses No Extraordinary Spirit

— Wu Yong

Previous people seemed to have said that Sima Qian, because he had traveled over famous mountains and great rivers and was inspired by them, thus his writing possessed an extraordinary spirit. This saying seems plausible, but it does not conform to reason. Famous mountains and great rivers are related to geography, Sima Qian wrote history, the two seem to have no involvement. Even if famous mountains and great rivers are spectacular, how can they make historical books possess extraordinary spirit?

The extraordinary nature of the Historical Records does not lie in the scenery, nor does it lie in the person who wrote it, but rather in the extraordinary events of the people recorded. History is essentially recording people and events; if the people and events recorded are not extraordinary, how can the writing recording people and events be extraordinary? — unless it is said that the events recorded in the Historical Records are all lies, entirely from the author's imagination. Saying that Sima Qian's writing possesses extraordinary spirit places emphasis on the person who records people and events, while neglecting the people and events recorded; it is to think that the Grand Historian was an extraordinary person, and not to marvel at the brilliance and strangeness of human affairs. This view is very unfavorable to the Grand Historian.

Or someone might say, if the Grand Historian was not an extraordinary person, how could there have been so many extraordinary people and events in the Han Dynasty? This is still another way of doubting that what the Grand Historian recorded was not true. What dynasty did not have extraordinary people and events, it is just that historians of other dynasties were mostly unwilling or dared not honestly and directly record them. Therefore, the difference between the Grand Historian and other historians is only this: he had a richer sense of justice than ordinary people, and when he felt something, he had to speak his mind, even if it meant inviting disaster, he would not care. The reason why the Historical Records is considered to have an extraordinary spirit is this; this also answers why, among books of this kind of nature in our country, there is only this one. Looking at the number of "extraordinary articles" and "extraordinary books" published in the American publishing industry today, which is far beyond what our country can reach, we can understand everything. Does America have so many extraordinary people who can write extraordinary articles?

Therefore, even if the Historical Records possesses an extraordinary spirit, it is derived from the scrutiny of human affairs, it is bestowed by the grace of extraordinary people and events in the world, it does not come mysteriously from appreciating famous mountains and great rivers. We can say this directly: Sima Qian's being subjected to castration was a first-class extraordinary event in the world, and the people who subjected him to castration were first-class extraordinary people in the world!

### 

During my illness, I casually flipped through the newspaper and saw the news of Feng Yuxiang being burned to death, and I couldn't help but recall this man's decades of turning clouds and overturning rain and the influence on past situations. Because of stomach illness and fatigue, I only have a bowl of thin porridge every day, and my mind and body are both exhausted. I cannot hold a pen. Recently, I changed to Western medicine and felt a little refreshed, so I force myself to write.

Feng's most amazing performance in his life was the scene of defecting and capturing Cao in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, leaving an impression of "dread" on the human world. And what was even more unexpected was that after performing "Trapping Cao's Mansion" (stationing troops in the Nine Gates and imprisoning Cao Kun in Xinhua Palace), he immediately put on a show of "Forcing the Qing Palace," sending a large group of soldiers to break into the Forbidden City and drive away the deposed Emperor Puyi and all the palace members. The reason why it is called unexpected is that Puyi's long residence in the old Forbidden City, towering high in the center of the capital of the Republic of China, and still issuing orders of reward and pension to his old officials and those who served the Republic but still remembered the Qing Dynasty's glory, was inappropriate. Therefore, clearing this "cancer" was not a bad thing. However, there were two most appropriate timing to relocate Puyi, both of which were not carried out. One was after the Xinhai Revolution, at the beginning of the Republic of China, when the abdication agreement originally contained a clause immediately ordering the relocation to the Summer Palace; the other was the Ding Si Restoration, when Zhang Xun used force to support him to restore the throne. Although it can be explained as being passive, since he ascended the "throne" and issued an "edict," he could be accused of usurpation and driven out, which would also be righteous. As for the Feng-Zhi Second War in the Jiazi year, which was the second act of the Feng-Huan First War in the eleventh year, Feng first punished the direct faction and then reconciled with Cao and the rate, which was nothing more than a circle of warlord disturbances, and had nothing to do with the Qing Dynasty. Suddenly being expelled, hastily and embarrassed, the Qing Emperor truly had a "calamity comes from the sky while sitting at home."

As for the clear signs of the impact of this move on the later general situation, it was the "Manchukuo" after the September 18th Incident. Originally, old Yuan's keeping Puyi in the palace in the early Republic had deep meaning. At that time, there were not a few Qing Dynasty old people and clan association thugs who were stupidly plotting a coup. If they were released out of the city, it would be tantamount to letting a tiger out of its cage. It is better to circle them in the center of the inner and outer cities, with layers of city walls, unable to cross the thunder pool for one step. The "Forbidden City" of the former Qing Dynasty forbade subjects from entering without permission, in order to express the emperor's dignity, so it was called "forbidden." The "Forbidden City" of the early Republic was to prohibit Puyi from going out privately, in order to prevent manipulation and utilization, so it was the same as "imprisonment." This both settled dissent and prevented future troubles. The political effect cannot be compared with emotional use.

Feng's expulsion of Puyi from the palace did not consider the aftermath and where he would go. The Japanese, with their keen eyes and quick hands, saw him as a rare commodity and welcomed him from the old Zui Mansion to the Legation Quarter in the first place. Then, they escorted him from Beijing to the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, and arranged a "palace" style residence for him, so that the old ministers could still visit him as before, and the Japanese consuls and bureaucrats also paid their respects on New Year's Day according to the Qing Dynasty's two-nation etiquette. Puyi's emperor's style in the palace in the past could only reach the old ministers, while in the Japanese Concession, he was also respected by the Japanese. With such means and such a conspiracy, outsiders can see clearly, how can the authorities not be confused. The Japanese movement to establish "Manchukuo" has not been a day or two. Later, Mr. Xinping's book "Zhengjiatun" has fraudulently narrated the failure of the Su Prince to manufacture a pseudo-country with assistance. Puyi's qualifications are far above Shanqi's, so after the September 18th Incident, Doihara immediately kidnapped him to the east from the Japanese Concession. It was simply taking advantage of the situation without any effort.

The establishment of "Manchukuo" and its impact on the overall situation in China and international fluctuations are well known in the world, so I will not elaborate.
