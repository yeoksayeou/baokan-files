[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao went to Beiping to meet with the President, seeking instructions on supplementary measures for the current financial and economic reforms and reporting on the current economic situation and government affairs. He returned to Beijing by air on the 25th despite the adverse weather. Mr. Weng took off from Beiping at 10:00 AM on the 25th. Shortly after, Nanjing Airport reported that the weather in the capital was unfavorable and the airport was unable to land planes. He immediately landed in Qingdao midway. He arrived in Qingdao at 12:15 PM. After disembarking and having lunch, he inspected the suburbs and met with Mayor of Qingdao Ji Xuesui and others to inquire about Qingdao's economic management. At 3:15 PM, he boarded the original plane and flew to Beijing, arriving at Ming Palace Airport at 5:40 PM amidst drizzling rain. After disembarking, Mr. Weng immediately drove back to his private residence on Langya Road to rest. At 9:00 PM in the evening, he met with Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu for a confidential discussion lasting about one and a half hours, after which Mr. Wang left. As a result of President Weng's visit to Beiping to meet with the President, important decisions have been made on new measures to remedy the financial and economic reforms. They will be submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting this Wednesday and then implemented.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] After completing his official duties in Beiping, President Weng left Beiping by special "Zhuiyun" ("Chasing Clouds") plane at 9:00 AM on the 25th to fly to Beijing. Fu Zuoyi, Chu Xichun, Liu Yaozhang, and others went to the airport to see him off. Ten minutes after the "Zhuiyun" plane took off, it returned to Xiyuan Airport due to engine trouble. Mr. Weng then transferred to the "Tianxiong" ("Heavenly Hero") plane at 10:15 AM and flew south. It is reported that Mr. Weng will stop briefly in Qingdao to inspect the local economic management situation. In addition, Tsinghua University professors Wu Jingchao and Liu Dazhong, and Peking University professor Jiang Shuojie, will go to Beijing in a few days to handle matters in Beiping.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] Before leaving Beiping, President Weng met with reporters at the airport and said: "I have fully understood the economic difficulties experienced in North China after this visit to the North. The government has decided to increase the supply to North China. However, the amount of flour rationed to individuals will be limited to the six major cities, and it is generally impossible to increase it. There are many problems in North China at present, but if the military, political, and economic sectors, as well as the central and local governments, can coordinate their efforts, we will surely overcome the difficulties and achieve victory in suppressing the bandits." When reporters asked about new economic measures, Weng replied that he was currently consulting with various ministers and parties. Several economic experts from universities in the North have also sent representatives to Beijing to provide government consultation.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Qingdao, 25th] Weng Wenhao arrived in Qingdao by special plane at 10:15 AM on the 25th. After disembarking, he went to the Yingbin Hotel to rest and had lunch with Liu Anqi and Ji Xuesui, conducting continuous discussions for several hours.

### Authorities Strengthen Economic Management; Considering Unified Adjustment of Organizations; Zhang Lisheng Returns South, Huo Baoshu Will Also Go to Beijing

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] According to authoritative sources, in order to strengthen economic management, the authorities are considering unifying and adjusting the past phenomenon of uncoordinated economic management organizations. Currently, there are more than twenty economic and financial control organizations, often resulting in duplication of work and independent actions. After the currency reform, the implementation of economic management over the past two months has in fact demonstrated the necessity of unifying economic management organizations and strengthening the supreme guidance of the central economic management. President Weng also sought instructions on the unification of economic management organizations during his visit to Beiping to meet with the President.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] The government will review economic management measures in districts of Beijing to seek improvements. Zhang Lisheng, the supervisor of the North China region, flew to Shanghai and then to Beijing on a [unclear character] Wang plane on the 25th. It is reported that Huo Baoshu, the supervisor of the South China region, will also represent Song Ziwen in going to Beijing to report. Zhang Lisheng flew from Beijing to Beiping on August 25th, which is exactly two months ago. Worried about the northern economy, his face was much thinner when he left Beiping than when he arrived. Before leaving, Mr. Zhang humbly told reporters with sixteen characters, "Ineffective supervision has burdened the local area; I am sincerely ashamed and will make amends in the future."

### To Prevent Panic Buying and Diversion of Goods; The Government Will Take Remedial Measures; Maintain Price Controls While Invigorating the Market

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] After President Weng's visit to Beiping to meet with the President, he has decided on several remedial measures for new problems that have arisen in the financial and economic sectors in the two months since the currency reform, such as panic buying and the proliferation of idle capital. These measures will soon be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval and implementation. The issue that most people are concerned about, the diversion of goods and the lack of goods available for purchase in the market, will be addressed with both fundamental and stopgap measures to remedy the situation. The fundamental measure is to increase production. The government will allocate a portion of foreign exchange to purchase raw materials and import production equipment, which will be distributed to legitimate manufacturers for production. The stopgap measure is to rationally adjust price controls, proactively adjusting unreasonable aspects of price controls to facilitate the flow of goods and invigorate the market. However, after this rational adjustment, the price control policy must continue to be maintained. To coordinate the implementation of this policy, the conservation of consumption will be more earnestly implemented. At the same time, in view of the diversion of goods caused by past panic buying, after the rational adjustment of price controls and the invigoration of goods, a coupon purchase system will be adopted for daily necessities to limit purchase quantities and ensure that the general poor have the opportunity to purchase. At the same time, a portion of foreign exchange will be allocated to import certain daily necessities to meet market needs. The adjustment of prices for state-owned and public utilities will be resolved simultaneously with this issue. In the past, public utilities and transportation were subsidized by the national treasury, increasing issuance. In the future, in order to tighten issuance, the subsidy policy will inevitably have to be changed. After the adjustment of public utilities and transportation, the salaries and wages of public servants and teachers will be adjusted accordingly to enable public servants and workers to maintain their livelihoods. At the same time, in response to the Communist bandits' high-priced purchase of gold, silver, and foreign currency to undermine the government's new currency system, the crackdown on the black market for gold notes will be strengthened. In addition to confiscating the gold notes, both buyers and sellers will be severely punished.

### To Alleviate Man-Made Suffering and Injustice; Professors from Major Universities in Beiping Draft a "Petition for the People's Lives"; Submitted by Hu Shi to the President and Executive Yuan President Weng

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] Zhu Guangqian, Zheng Huachi, Wang Yuxiu, He Lin, and seventeen other professors from universities in this city have jointly drafted a "Petition for the People's Lives" to "alleviate man-made economic suffering and injustice." The document has been submitted by Hu Shi to the President and Executive Yuan President Weng. The original text is as follows:

"A Petition for the People's Lives to Alleviate Man-Made Suffering and Injustice"

We do not believe that the government's resolute implementation of financial and economic reforms this time is a mistake. The motives for the reform are certainly not inappropriate. We sincerely hope that this measure, which directly affects the lives of the people, will succeed and not fail.

However, success must have its scope, its conditions, and its methods. If hopes exceed possible facts, and if necessary conditions and methods are lacking, then of course success is impossible. Impossible things are impossible.

Although rising prices are mainly due to inflation, reduced production, scarcity of goods, shrinking currency circulation areas, and the psychological impact of war and unrest can all cause prices to rise. When the authorities decided to reform the currency system and freeze prices on "August 19," they should have considered these factors. They should have understood that even if the amount of new currency issued did not exceed that of the legal tender, the prices would certainly not remain unchanged, given the current widespread war and the universal desire for survival and self-defense, especially in the North, where people are struggling to survive. The government-controlled area is shrinking, production is decreasing, goods are scarce, and the Communist Party is undermining government policies. The formation of prices is subject to various complex factors. Even in peaceful years, prices change constantly and seek natural equilibrium.

Moreover, the amount of gold yuan issued has increased several times compared to the old legal tender. According to the figures announced by the government, about 600 trillion legal tender issued before "August 19" can be fully recovered. However, the government stipulates that the maximum amount of gold yuan to be issued is 2 billion. If it is fully issued, it is equivalent to the amount of new currency in circulation being ten times greater than that of the old legal tender. The government should have known in advance that prices would inevitably rise if the amount of currency increased while production did not increase and the area of use did not expand. According to the announcement by the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee at the end of September, the issuance of gold yuan, including the exchange of legal tender and gold notes, has already [unclear character] ten billion, which is five times more than the amount of the old legal tender issued. It is now almost January. Under these circumstances, if prices are frozen at August 19, the people will have more and more gold yuan in their hands, and prices will appear to be cheaper. Even if there is no panic buying, the existing goods on the market will gradually be sold out, and the source will not be able to continue. The reason is that the August 19 prices and the amount of currency are out of balance. That is, the existing goods cannot absorb so much currency at low prices, which means that idle capital has increased significantly while the amount of goods has not increased. If prices do not rise, the balance will inevitably be lost, which will affect the lives of everyone.

As for the issuance of gold yuan, it is fully backed by reserves. This cannot prevent the rise in prices caused by the increase in gold yuan, because the reserves are not redeemable. The foreign exchange portion of the reserves cannot allow gold yuan holders to purchase foreign goods at any time. Under these circumstances, even if the reserves are doubled, it is irrelevant to the value of the gold yuan. As long as the amount of gold yuan issued is greater than the amount of legal tender at August 19, the currency is inflated again. This is beyond doubt.

As for why goods are not easily increased, the reason is obvious. Price controls are almost limited to cities, while the food and raw materials of cities mainly come from the countryside. If prices are only controlled in cities, and there is no ability to do anything about the production area of the countryside, this policy is tantamount to suicide. Moreover, because urban prices are low, gold yuan are not easily flowing into the countryside, and they are all flooding the cities, thus making the currency appear more abundant and the goods scarcer.

As a result of two months of price controls in cities, purchasing food and other daily necessities has become an extremely difficult task, especially for the common people, which is extremely pitiful. Some people set out under the stars and moon, waiting in line, which has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. We want to ask, is there really a shortage of food? Absolutely not. This is man-made suffering. Now is the time of the autumn harvest, and there should be no shortage of food. Rather, it is because food at controlled prices is not easy to enter the city, and the power of politics cannot defeat the economic actions of everyone. We cannot expect everyone to engage in money-losing economic behavior. Moreover, if the government does not purchase large quantities of indispensable food at high prices during this autumn harvest season, the danger of food shortages this winter and next spring is imaginable, especially in northern cities.

In addition to this, the gold notes and foreign exchange that the government has redeemed should be taken abroad to purchase essential goods and transported back. They should be rationed at the August 19 price, because the people's gold notes and foreign exchange were exchanged with the government at the August 19 price. This will enable the gold yuan to be withdrawn from circulation and increase the power to stabilize prices. Just imagine, if the amount of gold yuan issued was limited to 200 million yuan used to recover the legal tender, and the people did not have more paper money in their hands, prices would never have risen sharply.

However, if the government cannot use this method to withdraw the gold yuan from circulation, it should reduce the scope of success of the new currency system, that is, implement it in larger cities. Allocate enough food, cloth, coal, salt, oil, and sugar per person per month to maintain the minimum standard of living. The government should purchase these goods and ration them to the people at the August 19 price. In this way, on the one hand, the value of the gold yuan can be maintained, and on the other hand, the general public can benefit, because the income of the common people can only purchase essential goods, and the government's policies should mainly maintain the lives of the majority of the common people. As for the rural people, selling food at high prices can purchase other necessities in the cities. The government should greatly increase the taxes on non-essential goods to raise the funds for this subsidy. This can also have the effect of averaging wealth.

In addition to the government's rations, all other price controls should be abolished, allowing the people to engage in economic activities freely, so that the economy can be invigorated. At the same time, it can also absorb a portion of idle capital. The prices of non-essential goods and the gold yuan can also seek a natural economic balance. The most effective conservation is a fair rationing system. Other methods are irrelevant. The diligence and frugality of a few people is far less effective than a fair rationing system. Even the sale of luxury goods should not be prohibited, so that economic activities can increase tax revenue and the number of people employed can increase. Conservation is mainly about essential goods, not luxury goods.

Today, the result of the price control policy has created extremely unfair phenomena. Almost all goods and labor have a black market. Price controls only have disadvantages left. For example, the salaries of public servants and teachers are still price-controlled, the cost of living index for workers is still price-controlled, public utilities are still price-controlled, export settlements are still price-controlled, and the government's tax revenue cannot be reasonably adjusted. As a result, public servants and workers cannot live, export trade is stagnant, trains are extremely crowded, and telegrams must be queued for. The reason is that the price is too low. Only those that should be reasonably adjusted are subject to price controls. How can this be said to be fair?

We believe that: (1) The limit of success for the gold yuan is that the government can implement rationing of main essential goods per capita at the August 19 controlled price; (2) The government increases taxes and public utilities reasonably increase prices to [unclear character] subsidize the rations; (3) All other price controls are abolished, and there is no need to negotiate prices. Maintain a free market, so that economic activity does not stagnate and does not affect the basic life of the general public.

Unless the entire situation in China improves, or even unless the entire world situation improves, it is difficult to expect our country's economy to fully get back on track. The current economic stagnation is affected by the entire unstable situation at home and abroad. For example, in the United States, prices are inevitably rising due to excessive exports of foreign aid materials. The economic downturn is part of the whole problem. The economy will never be solved separately unless the whole problem is solved. From this point of view, financial and economic reforms can succeed as much as possible, and there is no such thing as failure.

The above principles will be implemented after approval by the President, and then the technical improvements will be studied and put into practice.

### Total Amount of Economic Cooperation Aid to China Exceeds 100 Million US Dollars; Second Batch of US Aid Flour Arrives in Shenyang

### United States Concerned About China's Economy; Will Provide Strong Support for Our Difficulties; Deeply Believes That the Communists Cannot Overthrow China

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] According to a US source, the US government is deeply concerned about China's current economic situation, and has long been prepared to assist us in solving difficulties and providing aid. However, some people believe that military aid to China is more urgent than economic aid. The US source also stated that the withdrawal of the National Army from some towns and cities is of little benefit to the Communist bandits, because after the National Army abandons some strongholds that do not need to be defended, it can make meticulous deployments and attack the Communist bandits. Analyzing the current political situation in China, the source said that due to the implementation of currency reform during military operations, the people will inevitably fall into double difficulties, but the US government will provide strong support. The US source's remarks were very optimistic, and he deeply believed that with the US government's aid plan, the Communist Party would not overthrow China.

### Northeast National Assembly Representatives' Association; Decides to Submit a Letter to President Chiang; To Save the Situation in the Northeast; Prepares a Plan to Defend Greater Shenyang

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] Local people in Shenyang have recently paid close attention to the situation in the Northeast and have expressed their opinions. The Northeast National Assembly Representatives' Association held a meeting on the 24th, and the emotions were passionate. Ma Yuchen said: "Everyone should ask the authorities to clearly express their decision on Shenyang: whether to defend it or retreat? If we defend it, everyone should contribute together and fight the Communist bandits to the end. Don't let the tide recede once and leave some poor little shellfish on the beach for others to pick up." As a result, it was decided to submit a letter to President Chiang to save the situation in the Northeast. The Northeast National Assembly Representatives' Association will also hold a welcome party for General Du Yuming to express condolences to General Liu Yuzhang's troops who recovered the towns and cities in southern Liaoning, and to pay tribute to General Zheng Tong, who died in action. Regarding the "July 5th" incident, they hope that the government will promptly implement the handling of the matter based on the results of the investigation. On the 25th, the representatives submitted the plan to defend Greater Shenyang to Deng Wenyi for transmission to the President, and personally stated the urgent situation in the Northeast. Mr. Deng agreed to forward it to the President immediately.

### Fu Zuoyi Talks About Military Affairs; National Army in North China Has Reached a Point of Taking the Initiative; The Suiyuan Relief Advance Corps Is Actively Advancing

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi told reporters today about the military situation in the North, saying: "In the Guankou battle in the eastern section of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway, the two sides used about 100,000 troops. If we had pursued in time, the results would have been even greater. Unfortunately, the National Army there fought hard for three days and nights without eating. They were too exhausted, which prevented them from obtaining all the fruits of victory. Because the military depends on the results, I am unwilling to make any predictions about the Suiyuan-Baotou battle. The Suiyuan Relief Advance Corps is actively advancing, and Deputy Commanders-in-Chief Deng Baoshan and Feng Qinzai are also beginning to 'compete' with the bandits in western Suiyuan." Mr. Fu also emphasized two points: First, terrain and all other conditions are secondary determinants. The most important condition for war is "fighting"; second, the National Army in North China has reached the point of actively finding the enemy to fight.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guihua, 25th] After the Suiyuan National Army took the initiative to withdraw from Baotou, the deployment for a large-scale annihilation battle has been completed. A strong corps has departed from a certain place and is advancing rapidly towards Suiyuan. Mountain teams on the Shanxi-Suiyuan border are proactively attacking and encircling the bandit army.

The Yulin relief army was blocked north of Suotengke Banner and south of Dongsheng. Therefore, the military temporarily took this decisive measure. According to refugees who fled to Gongmiaozi on the night of the 23rd, as of 1:00 PM, the bandit army had not yet entered the city, and only the poor were looting the materials of military and government agencies. Military academies have all reached safe areas. We departed from Gongmiaozi on the 24th. When we passed through Anbei, the stores were closed and the streets were full of wartime scenes. The telephone in Haye Hutong was out of service, and the situation nearby was unknown. General Deng Baoshan is receiving troops in a certain place in front. Tian Shumei, the military supervisor of western Suiyuan, and Wang [unclear character], Li Junfeng, a senator from Wuyuan, drove to visit him and provide opinions on defending Hetao. We entered Wuyuan in the evening, and the order was still considered stable. Relevant parties confirmed that 4,000 bandit cavalry entered Baotou at 3:00 PM yesterday. The situation in Yulin is chaotic, and the Ningxia Corps may arrive at the westernmost front line of Hetao, Xishan Mouth, within a few days.

Special Commentary

### After the Currency Reform

— Zhu Peiheng

Since the Gold Yuan Note entered our society, the situation of price increases has eased somewhat, which can be said that the currency reform has won a smooth start with the support of political power. However, although political power can be effective for a while, if it is not combined with other measures to solve various economic problems, then the future evolution is by no means optimistic. The so-called economic problems are still nothing more than the following three: (1) How to promote a balance between national treasury revenue and expenditure? (2) How to ensure that the supply of important items is not scarce? (3) How to promote a balance in international exchange revenue and expenditure?

These three problems are interconnected, and the government authorities must immediately devise appropriate strategies to solve these problems simultaneously. However, simple solutions should not be sought, and seeking them may be futile. Only with an exploring humility, a firm will, and lasting perseverance can one open up a bright future in the jungle of difficulties.

First, we (1) should discuss the way to balance international exchange revenue and expenditure. In our country's international exchange balance sheet, international trade accounts for the largest number. Regarding the actual situation of our country's foreign trade, the author lacks data on hand, so I cannot cite extensively, but based on daily observations, it is clear that our export items are nothing more than cheap raw materials and important foods that are insufficient for our own use, and the imports, in addition to production tools, scarce domestic transportation equipment, important raw materials, food, research books, medicines that cannot be manufactured domestically, etc., are still meaningful, but most of them are expensive non-essential goods and daily necessities that can be manufactured domestically. If the trade deficit formed by this situation cannot be reversed, then it is no longer an economic problem, but a serious problem of local national character.

The method of reversing the international trade deficit is nothing more than restricting imports and increasing exports. The method of restricting imports, in addition to the production tools, transportation equipment, important raw materials, food, etc. that are urgently needed domestically, should be allowed to be imported as much as possible, and the import volume of other imported goods should be controlled, and people (including government officials) should be strictly prohibited from wasting or making unnecessary purchases. As for non-essential goods and items that can be manufactured domestically, imports should be prohibited, and a date should be set to ban their supply on the market. Imported clothing, cosmetics, tobacco, alcohol, and canned foods, etc., should be classified separately, and a date should be set to prohibit people from continuing to consume or use them. Pianos, shortwave radios, small cars, yachts, cameras, etc., if owned by private individuals, must be subject to heavy taxes on a regular basis. Expensive watches or fountain pens, electrical appliances, etc., people shall not privately purchase or use them without special reasons.

In terms of increasing exports, important foods that are insufficient for our own needs should not be forced to be searched and transported for export unless necessary. For various artworks such as embroidery, carvings, traditional Chinese paintings, sculptures, ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, etc., attention should be paid to the improvement of technology and the suitability of design to increase sales abroad. Mineral sands, tung oil, and rare materials should be examined for their production and needs in the world, and favorable selling prices should be set separately. For medicinal materials and fruits, etc., which are uniquely produced domestically, experts can first analyze their effects, or publicly disclose their processing procedures, to win the trust of the world, and then widely recommend them to various parts of the world. As for domestically prohibited sales, prohibited use, and surplus imported goods, export businesses should be encouraged to collect them, transport them to foreign countries for sale, or exchange them for meaningful materials. When necessary, the government can set up a specialized agency to operate this business and accept public commissions to sell semi-new imported goods in foreign markets.

Some say that using these means to reverse the international trade deficit may cause various adverse consequences. For example, a sharp decrease in tariff revenue, international resentment, difficulty in suppressing domestic prices, and the government having to find another batch of enforcement personnel, thereby increasing the burden on the national treasury, etc. This type of warning should not be ignored. However, the government authorities must firmly believe that things are done by people. For example, although tariff revenue will decrease by a certain number, the taxpaying ability of the people will inevitably increase several times. As long as new tax sources are opened up, why worry about the loss of national treasury revenue? Regarding the international reaction, as long as the government authorities implement these policies with the determination to save the country and survive, not only will it not cause unreasonable criticism from the international community, but there is no need to worry even if there is. However, if the implementation is not strong, or a few special figures secretly sabotage it, it will only cause foreign discussion, and no effect can be expected. Some say that regardless of the nature of the product, putting the import of general imported goods can suppress prices, which is a theory full of toxins. Our country's industrial base is weak, and the foreign exchange in the hands of the country is extremely limited. If we are not careful in controlling imports, it will inevitably destroy the domestic industrial base and waste the valuable foreign exchange. As for the government authorities employing some enforcement personnel, it may not necessarily become a reason for increasing national treasury expenditure, because there is no shortage of idle manpower in the current government agencies. If the effectiveness of this part of the manpower is brought into play, wouldn't it be enough to meet the needs of this enforcement work?

In addition to imported goods, foreign-owned enterprises within the national border are also a major factor in the leakage of foreign exchange. For foreign-owned enterprises, those that are not beneficial to the nation and do not comply with regulations should be ordered to change industries. As for legitimate enterprises, they can be treated equally with those operated by Chinese people, but they have no right to exchange foreign exchange with our government for their periodic profits and income, and they must not privately exchange remittances from overseas Chinese. However, they can also find ways to transfer funds to religious organizations in China and designate some minor materials to be transported for export.

If the above points can be implemented by the government with utmost fairness and sincerity, and supplemented with appropriate foreign exchange rates, then not only can the foreign exchange balance be balanced and the black market for foreign exchange be eliminated, but even the government authorities can control huge amounts of foreign exchange to meet the needs of domestic economic construction and stabilize the market prices of important items.

(II)

Next, let's discuss how to promote the supply of important items from becoming scarce. The principle is also very ordinary, that is, to strengthen the production and marketing of various items, and to prevent the waste or hoarding of various items. There are two ways to avoid the waste of various items:

(1) Adopt a quantitative distribution system so that the general public can purchase limited necessities of life at low prices.

(2) Adopt a "consistent adjustment" policy so that the prices of various items are adjusted in equal proportions according to the rise and fall of productivity and purchasing power in society, and no cyclical adjustments are allowed.

Among the two, the former is more thorough, and the latter is easier to implement. However, examining the current situation, these two methods can be implemented simultaneously, and the way to start should be to adopt a quantitative distribution system. Recently, there has been a proposal to implement comprehensive rationing in the Shanghai area, which is based on the needs of the environment. However, the implementation of a comprehensive rationing system not only requires the use of a large amount of manpower, but also requires the control of huge amounts of materials, which may not be sustainable for the current government. It is better to divide the implementation of the rationing system into several steps. At present, government employees, military dependents, the working class, and the extremely poor should be the targets of rationing; at the same time, those who enjoy rationing rights must earnestly support the currency reform policy and be practitioners of the diligent and frugal nation-building movement. Various rationed goods must not be luxurious, not be mixed with inferior quality, and be distributed to the beneficiaries in the most appropriate procedure. For example, the quality of food must be uniform and clean, and clothing should be based on domestic products in principle. More economic cafeterias should be set up in urban areas, and seating tickets with ration coupons should be distributed to the working class. The government authorities should also use ration coupons to increase the number of materials under their control. For example, if farmers sell more agricultural products to the government, they can not only recover considerable compensation, but also obtain richer ration coupons.

The countermeasure to prevent the hoarding of goods is to severely punish hoarders according to law. To strengthen the marketing of various products, we must first take care of the interests of marketers. If we want to control prices, we must first control the selling price of various items in the production area.

The way to increase the output of various items is nothing more than to relieve the difficulties of producers and protect the interests of producers, and the government should do its best to promote the mutual coordination of various production conditions. The principles of increasing the production of important items are summarized as follows: (Continued on page six)

### Major Case of Private Gold Certificate Operation in Tianjin: Special Criminal Court Begins Hearing, Principal Offender Lun Qianru and Others Appear in Court to Defend Themselves

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 25th] The sensational case of Zan Chen's wife, Lun Qianru, privately operating a huge gold certificate business, began hearing on the 25th by the Special Criminal Court. The primary defendant, Lun Qianru, admitted to using 36,360 US dollars, through the introduction of a German named Wei Er, to purchase 120 gold bars from a German named Maier, but claimed never to have seen Maier. She ultimately argued that she intended to report the crime to the authorities in order to receive a reward, as a friend surnamed Jiang had secretly arranged with her in May to buy gold with US dollars, intending to report this for the reward. Wei Er testified that he was introduced to Lun Qianru by Jiang Bingyu. He claimed that a German named Maier stated that a Russian named Lavarov wanted to sell 240 gold bars, but had no buyer. Wei Er then sought a buyer from Lun Qianru and sold 120 bars, earning a commission of 15 bars. Lun's defense lawyer, an elderly attorney, argued that the gold seller had not appeared from beginning to end, suggesting that selling gold may have been a means to defraud US dollars and then make an arrest. He emphasized that the investigation should focus on finding the gold seller, and that mere verification of funds did not constitute a gold transaction. Wei Er's lawyer, Attorney Guo, argued that the incident occurred before August 19th and should be handled by the local court, arguing that the Special Criminal Court should not have jurisdiction. The court ultimately ruled that the case would be continued for a future hearing.

### Major Case of Arms Smuggling in Xiamen: Over a Hundred Guns and Ten Thousand Rounds of Ammunition Seized on the Zhibade Wheel Arriving in Xiamen from the Philippines

However, no one on the scene claimed ownership of the arms, which were all confiscated immediately. It is reported that a principal offender, an overseas Chinese visitor, was arrested by the water police. At noon, the garrison and military police stationed in Xiamen, upon learning of the incident, all dispatched teams to board the ship. The location where the seized arms will be stored remains undecided as of this evening. This seizure is the largest arms smuggling case this year, and there are two more packages of luggage that may also contain arms, potentially bringing the total to two hundred guns.

### Compromise Solution to the Berlin Problem: Security Council Submits to Vote; Soviet Envoy Arrives in Paris with a Strong Stance: Advocates Gradual Lifting of Blockade While Simultaneously Negotiating Currency Issue

[This newspaper] Paris, 25th Broadcast: The Security Council, to give the Western powers ample time to study Vyshinsky's new proposal, postponed the meeting time from 3 pm to 5 pm. Vyshinsky had received new instructions from Moscow. Before midnight on the 24th, he summoned Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia by telephone to meet at the Soviet embassy. US Representative Jessup, British Representative Jebb, and French Representative Parodi began a secret meeting at the US delegation office at 3 pm. An hour later, they decided to visit Bramuglia at his residence. After the meeting, Jessup told reporters, "There is still some hope of a solution." Vyshinsky's new proposal advocates a gradual lifting of the Berlin blockade while simultaneously resuming negotiations on the Berlin currency issue. He opposes the negotiation of the currency issue and the complete lifting of the Berlin blockade occurring simultaneously.

[This newspaper] Paris, 25th Broadcast: The Western powers have abandoned all efforts to reach a resolution on the Berlin issue with the Soviet Union in the United Nations. After lengthy secret talks, they decided to risk a Soviet veto and immediately vote on the compromise proposal of the six neutral nations of the Security Council. According to Colombian representative Echeverri, who participated in the meeting, "Due to the strong stance of the Soviet Union, the neutral countries are no longer making efforts to mediate." He predicted that the Soviet Union would veto the compromise proposal, and the final vote in the Security Council would be nine to two, with the Soviet Union and Ukraine voting against.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] According to people close to Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia today, the draft proposed by the neutral countries regarding the Berlin issue, unless a "miracle" occurs, will not be able to prevent the Soviet Union from using its veto power against the proposal when the Security Council votes. The Security Council is about to convene while Bramuglia continues to confer with representatives of the Western powers. This morning, he also met with representatives of various neutral countries, reportedly informing them of his two-hour consultation with Soviet representative Vyshinsky on the night of the 24th. Vyshinsky has received orders from Moscow. According to the same source, the main difficulty is that the Soviet Union wants the Western powers to agree to recognize the Soviet mark as the "legal tender" for the entire city of Berlin simultaneously with the Soviet Union lifting the Berlin blockade, while the Western powers still insist on their original view that the blockade should be lifted first, and then currency issues should be negotiated. It is also reported that the British representative is a fervent supporter of this position, while the United States and France are taking a more compromising attitude, that is, implementing a currency control measure for the entire city of Berlin while the four powers are holding negotiations.

### Egypt Accuses Jews of Violating Truce Agreement; Security Council to Meet Today to Discuss; US Policy on Holy Land Faces Disagreement

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The Egyptian representative notified the Security Council today that the Jewish army in Palestine is unwilling to abide by the Security Council's ceasefire order and continues to violate the truce, appealing to the Security Council to pay attention to this matter. To this end, the United Nations Secretariat officially announced today that the Security Council will convene on the morning of the 26th to study the issue of truce violations.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] US domestic politics once again caused confusion over the Palestinian issue in the United Nations on the 25th, threatening the early demise of Bernadotte's plan to partition the Holy Land. While the US representatives here believed that the plan had been shelved before the election, a dispute over Holy Land policy unfolded between Truman and Dewey. Some United Nations representatives believe that Dewey's recent proclamation contradicted the policies outlined by the US delegation at the beginning of the General Assembly. Days before the General Assembly convened, Marshall announced that the United States supported the Bernadotte plan as the basis for resolving the Palestinian issue, but as soon as Truman's statement was published, the Israeli representatives, who had consistently opposed the Bernadotte plan behind the scenes at the General Assembly, were overjoyed. One Israeli statement read, "The official US policy opposes any change to Israel's borders without Israel's consent, which is extremely important." This statement fully indicates that the Israeli delegation to the General Assembly believes that US policy has changed from supporting the Bernadotte plan to opposing it. The main reason Israel opposes the plan is that Bernadotte advocates that Israel relinquish the vast Negev area in exchange for Western Galilee. The Arab side also vowed to oppose it to the death, as the plan stipulates the recognition of the State of Israel and its right to exist. Many General Assembly representatives were surprised when the US State Department announced that Truman's statement supporting the old partition plan and Marshall's policies were not in conflict. They want to know whether the United States will support the Bernadotte plan next week or back down and not endorse it.

### Romania Reapplies for Membership

[This newspaper] Paris, 25th Broadcast: Romania submitted its application for membership to the United Nations today. Romania has submitted this application three times before, all of which were rejected by the Western bloc in the Security Council.

### General Assembly Discusses Greek Issue; Allows Albania and Bulgaria to Attend and Make Statements

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The Political Committee this morning passed a US proposal by a vote of 29 to 6, with 6 abstentions, regarding Albania and Bulgaria attending the debate on the Greek issue and answering some questions from the committee. Yugoslav Representative Bebler requested the Political Committee to allow the Greek Marcos government to send representatives to attend the debate and make statements, but was strongly opposed by Greek Representative Pipinelis, who stated that this violated the United Nations Charter. Soviet Representative Gromyko supported the Yugoslav representative's suggestion. After this, the Political Committee adjourned the meeting until tomorrow.

### Foreign Minister Wang Meets Marshall Again Before Leaving Paris

[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie had lunch with Marshall today. This was Wang's last meeting with the US Secretary of State before returning to China. Wang will leave Paris on the evening of the 27th.

### Secret Meeting of Foreign Ministers of Five Western European Countries: Discussing Atlantic Joint Defense; Bevin Conditionally Agrees to Plan for Western European Parliament

[This newspaper] Paris, 25th Broadcast: The meeting of the foreign ministers of the five Western European Union powers opened on the 25th at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. French Foreign Minister Schuman was elected as chairman. The issue of the United States and Canada joining the military alliance was included in the agenda. According to authoritative British and American sources, the main issue of this meeting will be the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty between the Western European Union and the American powers. British officials stated that, in view of the confidentiality of this meeting, they decided to impose further restrictions on the disclosure of information about future meetings, and to issue a communiqué at the end of the meeting. According to informed sources, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will conditionally support the proposal of France and Belgium for a Western European Parliament. This international parliament will be composed of representatives selected from the parliaments of the five countries and will have deliberative powers.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 25th] The New York Herald Tribune commented today in an editorial on the rumor that the United States might participate in an Atlantic alliance including the five signatory countries of Brussels and Canada, stating that it would be impossible to achieve this in the final days before the presidential election, but that if any steps were taken in this regard, it would be the most serious and difficult task for the new government. The report continued, stating that if the rumored Atlantic alliance is true, then the significance of this matter has exceeded the scope of the Vandenberg Resolution. The suggestion is that the United States can only maintain cooperation with foreign regional agreements. The article solemnly pointed out that Americans cannot ignore the significance of this step, as the United States will be responsible for supplying materials for the rearmament of Western Europe, which places another responsibility on the United States in addition to the Marshall Plan and the atomic energy program. The newspaper concluded that, if so, the Atlantic alliance will become an alliance challenging other countries.

### US Prepares for Future Atomic War: Major Plan to Build Air Fleet; Build More Deep-Sea Submarines to Operate in the Ocean

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] The US Navy Department revealed today that it has completed the aircraft plan for the fleet in the "atomic age". According to US Navy Vice Admiral Miller, the plan includes four points: (1) building aircraft carriers capable of carrying the fastest large naval aircraft newly built after the war; (2) building extremely fast submarines that can operate in the deepest oceans; (3) building extremely fast combat submarines that can potentially penetrate deep into the sea; (4) building special ships for surveying the Arctic. He also stated that the atomic age fleet naturally includes 65,000-ton aircraft carriers, which can allow four bombers carrying atomic bombs to take off simultaneously. The two aircraft carriers "Essex" and "Wasp" from the last war will be modernized to enable them to carry modern aircraft. Subsequently, other aircraft carriers will also be similarly "modernized". The plan for the new submarine fleet includes: (1) building six extremely fast submarines; (2) building transport submarines to supply provisions to troops in transit; (3) building oil tankers to supply gasoline to submarines; (4) two cruisers; (5) four torpedo boats; (6) and three submarines to combat submarines from other countries.

### Rumors of British and Four Arab Countries Negotiating Defense of Middle East Agreement

[United Press, Beirut, 25th] Tensions between the United Kingdom and Arab countries have existed for some time. There are constant rumors that at least four Arab countries intend to sign an agreement with the United Kingdom. Both sides are reportedly doing so out of fear of the outbreak of a third world war. Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon are expected to reach an agreement with the United Kingdom. Some people in Arab capitals say that, in fact, Arab representatives have already begun negotiations with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and other senior foreign officials in Paris. However, the Arab governments have made no official statement on this matter. Although the Arab side opposes the British policy on Palestine, it is still consulting with British leaders and listening to Bevin's report on the global situation. British and American military experts believe that the Middle East is a must-contend place in the next war. The Soviet Union has been coveting it for a long time, which has become an open secret. British and American experts also firmly believe that the Middle East should be defended from Soviet offensives.

[This newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo, at 6:20 pm yesterday, convened representatives of ten industries in the Central Bank conference room and gave an important speech lasting forty minutes. Director Wu Kaixian was also present. The representatives of the ten industries were Pan Shihao (dyeing and weaving), Shi Zhifu (western medicine), Liang Songling (soap), Jin Shuping (cigarettes), Le Jiarong (hat making), Guo Linshuang and Liang Weisi (department stores), Yi Jingqing (fiber groceries), Wang Zuosheng (Qi charcoal), Wu Qinghua and Liu Haokai (thermos manufacturing), and Gu Kangrui (coal briquettes).

He said that the names of those who deliberately conceal goods have been investigated and made clear, and if they do not change their ways, they will soon face the consequences. He also pointed out that those who exchanged gold certificates and foreign currency in the past two months were all small citizens with wealth below the middle class, and the real major holders have not moved at all. The management office has now collected accurate information and will take effective action from the first of next month to make them serve the country. Comprehensive rationing will be implemented from the first of next month. From then on, each citizen's purchase volume will be restricted by the ration card, and the wealthy will not be able to purchase more than their share. Merchants can also supply goods to the market as much as possible, so that there will be no fear of running out of purchases. The "August 19" price limit decision will be maintained, but the prices of goods other than daily necessities must take into account their production costs, and the government will guarantee the legitimate interests of industry and commerce. Shanghai does not lack raw material inventories. The raw materials controlled by several major companies such as so-and-so can supply the city's factories. As for the foreign raw material supply, President Weng has promised to allocate foreign exchange for purchase when I go to Beijing. As for the adjustment of materials, the established policy will be followed, and the city's yarn and sugar will be exchanged for rice, wheat, and other agricultural products from other cities. Everything will be based on the "August 19" price limit as the standard. Recently, there has been smuggling of goods and a black market for gold certificates. The crackdown will be strengthened. The inspection work will be strengthened starting today in order to eradicate them. After Supervisor Chiang finished speaking, Director Wu Kaixian stood up and gave a speech, expressing his full support for Supervisor Chiang's policy and his firm belief in his success.

Although the crisis of life may attack you, the arm of loving kindness will protect you. May the Lord be with you until we meet again. Yin Lansun's last words. Morning of October 25, 1948, Anno Domini." Yue Xinmin's will to his wife said that he was a victim of the times. The will stated: "Zhenhua, my wife, farewell forever. May you be safe and not grieve. I am a victim of the times. I don't feel uncomfortable. I hope you treat my father well and take care of the children. The letter attached to the children, from page six to page seven, there is also a letter I wrote to you in the room that is not finished, you can keep it as a souvenir. Thank you to my brother for his trouble. See you again, please do not be sad, take care of your body, because you still have the responsibility to raise the children and serve my father. Xinmin's last words. Zhang Yuan's will was also filled with a religious atmosphere.

The letter frequently urged his children not to commit crimes for the sake of food and money, and to maintain a life that can only be maintained, without extravagance. There was also a written Christian proverb, chapter thirty-one, the full text of which was about 2,000 words. His instructions also stated: "When we come into the world, we bring nothing and cannot take anything away. Just have clothes and food and be content. Now I order Tigers and Zhaohua to study theology, and Azhi is calm and cautious, and can study medicine to treat people, not to trade for profit, but to heal people with physical and mental illnesses. Miaomiao is very clever and has good eloquence, so she can study law, promote justice, and protect human rights." He continued: "Unfortunately, I was born in a troubled world and cannot get the protection of the law. Although I admit everything frankly, the unfair law has no love. I am not given a chance to reform and I must be punished with the death penalty. Today, your father is ridiculed in front of people and cannot be understood, but I am very comforted." Finally, he said: "I am going to be with Christ, and I will surely protect you and your mother in secret. You should also often pray to be spiritually connected with me. In addition to repeatedly studying the Old and New Testaments, each of you should read at least one chapter of Proverbs every day. There are thirty-one chapters in Proverbs, and you can read all of them once a month." The end note: "Lord! I have come to do your will, may you save my soul." When the bailiffs escorted Zhang Yuan to execution, Zhang repeatedly prayed, "May the heavenly Father be with me."

### The Battle City of Taiyuan

— Our Reporter

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 20th] The defense of Taiyuan, which began on the 5th of this month, has been raging for more than half a month. According to an estimate by Yang Ai-yuan, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, the attacking bandit army has suffered more than 30,000 casualties. The war situation is critical and continues to worsen. Late at night on the 18th, Yang Ai-yuan, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, and Wang Huai-ming, Speaker of the Shanxi Provincial Assembly, flew to Peiping to seek assistance from the President. The President promised to provide his full support and decided to airlift reinforcements again.

Air Transport of Reinforcements

The central government has long been determined to defend Taiyuan, because the importance of Taiyuan in the overall national situation is self-evident. At the same time, the twenty-odd light and heavy industries, large-scale modern factories that have been fully operational for the past three years, can manufacture locomotives, refine steel, produce military weapons and daily necessities for both military and civilian use. In today's war-torn country, they are particularly valuable national assets. The only guarantee for this airlift of reinforcements and supplies is the safeguarding of the remaining northern airfield (located fifteen li north of the city).

Bandit Army Replenishment

The Jinzhong Campaign in July was extremely fierce. According to a military officer who was captured and escaped back to Xi'an, the bandit side claimed that in the battles in villages such as Dachang in the suburbs of Yu, Tai, and Xu counties, the bandits suffered more than 60,000 casualties. However, the bandit side quickly replenished its forces through threats, enticements, and other vicious means. In just two months, it had once again gathered what it called the First Corps of the North China Field Army and tens of thousands of troops from the Jinzhong, Taiyue, Luliang, and Jinsui Military Regions, returning with renewed vigor. Under the command of the bandit leader Xu Xiangqian, they ignited the fierce flames of the siege of Taiyuan.

Mountainous Areas

Taiyuan has now become an isolated city under siege. Yan Xishan has subsequently put forward the slogan of "Building a Battle City of Taiyuan," aiming to develop in the aspects of living, production, and combat, so that military, political, economic, social, educational, and all other departments' personnel, as well as male and female citizens, are all combat-ready, to ensure the defense of Taiyuan and restore the whole of Shanxi. The Communist bandits certainly do not want this work to be effective, so at the very beginning of the establishment of the battle city, they launched a full-scale and comprehensive offensive. Taiyuan is located in a basin, and controlling the mountainous areas on the east and west sides, a dozen or so li away from the city, is the guarantee of Taiyuan's safety.

Arc-Shaped Battle Line

Taiyuan's difficulty originally lies in food supply, as the summer harvest has not been collected and there is no autumn grain to collect either. The food for more than 300,000 citizens and tens of thousands of soldiers relies solely on stockpiles and air transport. Today, how to reverse the war situation is the most important thing. Taiyuan is known throughout the country for its solid city defense works. High, medium, low, and underground bunkers, as well as firing points made of brick, stone, cement, and reinforced steel bars, are scattered around the city. However, the recent battles have already partially penetrated this solid defense line. The arc-shaped battlefield from the northeast of the city to the south is all located on the mountain ridges ten to twenty li away from the city. Removing the threat to the city walls and ensuring the security of the northern airfield both depend on the heroic National Army destroying the bandit army on this arc-shaped battlefield in the mountainous area.

### The Jiaxing Grain Loan Case Concluded at the Haining District Court

[Our Haining Dispatch, 23rd] The Jiaxing Grain Loan Case, which was transferred by the Zhejiang High Court to this county's District Court, was heard on the 22nd. The main figure in this case, Huang Tongsheng, the Standing Director of the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce and the Chairman of the Rice Industry Association, was accused by Jiang Xisheng, a resident of Zhongquan Road, Jiaxing, in February of this year to the High Prosecutor's Office for abusing his power in grain loan corruption. The Jiaxing District Court felt deeply inconvenient to hear this case, so it requested the High Court to transfer jurisdiction. The High Court designated this county's District Court to hear the case. The case has been declared concluded and will be sentenced at 9:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month.

### Snakes Everywhere in Changzhou, Armed Scalpers Appear

[Our Wujin Dispatch, 23rd] The 819 price limit for economic reform in Changzhou has been implemented until today, and the situation has reached its limit. For the past three days, it has not been possible to buy a whole dan (unit of weight) of rice in the urban area. Changzhou Middle School and Private Zhengwei Middle School, which have many students, have not been able to purchase daily rations of rice, firewood, oil, and salt, so they have had to temporarily close and dismiss the students, telling each student to bring rice from home. However, the rice in the rural areas of Changzhou has just been harvested and has not yet been processed into rice, so it cannot be brought back immediately. To cope with this, the Grain Association decided on the 23rd to allow each person to purchase half a sheng (unit of volume) of rice per day with their National Identification Card. Naturally, ten long queues have been formed in ten places. The oil pressing has been a long queue for more than a week. The fiercest people in the middle are armed scalpers. Several iron gates and counters of oil factories have been subjected to beatings. Oil factories lose one jin (unit of weight) for every jin they sell. There is no way to replenish the soybeans, and this crisis cannot be managed. From the 20th, each person is allowed to purchase one jin of oil per month with their identification card, but the congestion in the long queues has not been eliminated at all. Nine out of ten shops on the main street are empty. They open after 10:00 a.m. and close at 3:00 p.m., all cold and desolate, matching the bleak autumn season!

[Another Dispatch] Food in the urban area has presented a serious panic. The People's Food Adjustment Committee has decided: Absolutely prohibit external transportation and strictly prohibit the black market. First, organize a joint food distribution center, targeting ordinary people (including public and educational personnel), limited to 20,000 people in the urban area. The Jiaxiu Town Office will create a register, report it to the committee, and issue permits for distribution. Regardless of the size of the family, each person will receive two dou (unit of volume) per month. Exchange goods with Shanghai, which will be organized by the County Joint Cooperative and various trade associations.

### Waterxigou Iron Mine Survey Completed, Reserves Reach 50,000 Tons

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 24th] The Waterxigou Iron Mine in Fuyuan has a very long history. Recently, the Geological Survey Institute sent personnel to conduct a survey, and it is estimated that the iron ore reserves reach 50,000 tons. If 1,200 jin are smelted daily, it will be enough for more than 100 years of mining and smelting. Moreover, coking coal, coke, refractory clay, and other smelting materials are all nearby, making it worthwhile to develop.

Fresh meat is also stipulated to be sold only from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., a total of three hours. Most of the other industries are open from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m., or 9:00 p.m.

### After the Currency Reform Continued from Page Two

(1) Any person has the right to apply to the government authorities for work to solve their livelihood problems. The government authorities should introduce all idle manpower into various production industries. What is particularly important is that, before the production sector is able to accommodate transfers, do not create "artificial" unemployed masses.

(2) All arable wasteland and open land must be immediately cultivated and used as much as possible; the government should formulate good agricultural plans to make all agricultural products meet the needs of society.

(3) Stabilize rural order and eliminate all inequalities in rural areas; the government should at any time appoint clean and caring people to visit and inquire about the hardships of the peasants. Political workers in rural areas who have outstanding achievements should be given special rewards. Diligent and persistent farmers can also receive preferential treatment in the form of reduced taxes and exemption from military service.

(4) The government should do its best to help solve the problems of industrial production tools, raw materials, power, and labor. The evaluation of products must take into account costs and legitimate profits. The threat of imported goods should also be resisted by the government. Factories with excellent performance should be given priority and more favorable quotas for loans, raw materials, and power.

(5) The primary business of national banks should be to support productive enterprises. Loan programs should meet the needs of the majority of the people. The responsibilities between various bank bureaus and treasuries must be clearly delineated. If there is surplus capacity, they can also engage in other banking businesses. Private banks must transfer a certain percentage of their daily deposit balance to the central bank or assist a national bank in engaging in production loans. The collateral for commercial loans should be limited to daily necessities; the situation of all collateral should be reported by each bank to the local designated agency at any time. If the market price of a certain collateral soars, the government authorities have the right to purchase it at the market price when it was provided as security and distribute it to the people at a fair price.

(6) Consolidate the security of various industrial areas. The government should give various rewards to those who operate productive enterprises and have outstanding achievements. The interests of term depositors in banks must be protected so that floating capital gradually flows into the production sector.

(7) If the social productivity expands, various important materials such as cotton, cloth, rice, wheat, paper, coal, and steel can also be purchased to supplement paper money reserves. However, the quality of the purchased goods must be strictly regulated; the purchase prices in various places should also be separately verified.

Finally, let's discuss how to balance the national treasury's revenue and expenditure. To achieve a balance between the national treasury's revenue and expenditure, there is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. On the revenue side, the most basic measures are of course to eliminate corruption in tax authorities and reduce the expenditure of tax authorities. If you want to increase tax revenue, you must first increase the amount of production in society and prohibit luxury and waste to increase the ability of the people to pay taxes. As for new sources of tariffs, they should target luxury goods and non-essential goods. For example, the private cars, mansions, gardens, villas, pianos, shortwave radios, etc. of the rich should be taxed on a regular basis. Ordinary people's hotels, cafeterias, barbershops, photo studios, etc. do not need to pay public taxes, but their prices should be strictly controlled, and they are not allowed to lay out unnecessary equipment or consume luxurious goods. However, luxury hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues, and service venues can freely set prices, and can lay out perfect equipment, hire sufficient service personnel, store rich food, and even allow the consumption of limited imported goods; but they must pay heavier taxes. Appropriate tax rates should also be set for various non-essential goods such as tobacco, alcohol, wool, silk, foreign tea, etc.; among them, tobacco and alcohol taxes must be paid in cash, and other goods can also be offset at the market price when paying taxes. The government should also prevent tax evasion. For example, alcohol must be sold in bottles, tea must be sold in bags, and numbered tax stamps must be sealed on the seams. The entrance tickets for entertainment venues should be printed uniformly by the government.

Let's discuss saving the expenditure of the national treasury. Construction costs, construction costs, rent for real estate, entertainment expenses, and transportation expenses in various agencies, all unnecessary ones, should be saved as much as possible. Improve the work efficiency of civil servants, and promote the surplus manpower of various agencies to transfer into the production sector, or provide short-term training and recommend them to newly established institutions. Currently, the biggest burden on the national treasury is the cost of suppressing the rebellion. In order to avoid the extra expenditure caused by setbacks in the war, in a passive way, we should try to improve the living and medical equipment of soldiers, make good use of dangerous places, consolidate defense projects, maintain secrecy, and seek more benefits for the families of soldiers. Actively, we should start by revitalizing politics. If politics is on track, not only can the Kuomintang be in an invincible position, but the internal strife can also be ended sooner.

This currency reform plan, except for the fact that the freezing of commodity prices on a certain day and the neglect of supporting productive enterprises are indeed worthy of review, the rest are theoretically stable and feasible. Not long after the currency reform, the government launched a diligent and frugal nation-building movement, which is indeed a timely move. Because if the diligent and frugal movement is effective, the currency reform will also be successful. However, in order to promote the smooth development of the diligent and frugal movement, we must first rely on the leading implementation of party and government officials. (End)
