### Gu Zheng gang Inspects Bianyuan; Standards for Emergency Relief to Henan Disaster Determined; Qin Decun Comforts Wounded Officers and Soldiers

[Special Dispatch from Xiangzhou, 4th] Kaifeng Dispatch: Minister Gu Zhenggang and Vice Minister Qin Decun arrived in Bian by special plane at 2:00 PM on the 2nd, accompanied by Chairman Liu of Henan Province. They immediately went to Xiaonanmen, Songmen, Caomen, Longting and other war zones to inspect. That evening, at a symposium held by various sectors at the Provincial Bank, Chairman Liu first reported on the Kaifeng campaign. Subsequently, Gu and Qin delivered speeches, stating that they came to represent the Central Government and extend their deepest condolences to the people of Henan Province, especially Kaifeng, and expressed their greatest respect to Chairman Liu and all the soldiers who defended Kaifeng. Although the relief funds are meager and difficult to compensate for the losses in the war, they have great significance in spirit. Representatives from all sectors in Henan then made statements, unanimously calling on the Central Government to immediately stop conscripting soldiers and grain from Henan Province, and elaborating on the causes and consequences of the Kaifeng campaign, requesting accountability for senior commanders. On the morning of the 3rd, Vice Minister Qin presided over a public memorial service for the late Division Commander Li Zhongnian. Afterwards, Gu inspected the schools most severely affected by the disaster, such as Henan University and Kaifeng Women's Normal School, while Qin went to the hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers and the remaining 400 officers and soldiers of the 66th Division, 13th Brigade. In the afternoon, Gu also attended a meeting of the local relief committee, where the standards for distributing relief were determined. According to Minister Gu's announcement, the central government's emergency relief funds for the Henan disaster include 360 billion to subsidize security teams and 295 billion for relief. In addition to the 50 billion brought by Gu and the 35 billion brought by the Executive Yuan's comfort mission, and the 10 billion remitted to Zhengzhou, the remaining funds are being transported to Bian by the Executive Yuan and will be distributed soon. The distribution standards that were decided are: 10 million for each person who died or was seriously injured due to the disaster, 5 million for minor injuries, 3 million for those who cannot be saved without assistance, and 10 million for each disaster-affected household whose houses were destroyed. This will be handled by the Executive Yuan's comfort mission in conjunction with local authorities. In addition, Vice Minister Qin brought 10 billion yuan on the President's orders specifically to provide pensions for the families of officers and soldiers who were killed or wounded. Furthermore, when the President was in Zhengzhou, he personally instructed the allocation of 50 billion for emergency relief to public educators and 35 billion for emergency relief to students. The procedures for distribution began yesterday, with 10 million for each public educator and 2 million for each student.

### Kuomintang Central Political Committee Resolves to Recommend Dong Zhao Concurrently as Chairman of Shaanxi; President Urges Reflection on Past Work

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Kuomintang President Chiang Kai-shek personally presided over the Central Political Committee on the 5th. First, Minister of National Defense He Yingqin reported on military affairs, stating that the main battles are underway in eastern Henan and western Shandong. The bandit armies of Chen and Liu have gathered forces of over 200,000 people, and the National Army has also mobilized a comparable number. Fierce fighting is currently underway. The bandit side has suffered losses of over 20,000 people in this campaign. After He's report, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Chaojun, and others spoke, mostly focusing on the lack of coordination in current party, government, and military work. Finally, the President stood up and gave a speech, believing that the lack of proper coordination between the party, government, and military is a fact, but everyone has a responsibility in the current situation, so a thorough review is necessary. The President's opinion is to emphasize reflection on past work, and the attendees also expressed agreement, but the method, time, and location of this review have not yet been decided. Subsequently, various personnel proposals were passed as follows: (1) Chairman of Shaanxi Zhu Shaozhou will be reassigned, and it is internally decided to appoint Dong Zhao, commander of the 19th Pacification Zone, concurrently. (2) Duanmu Kai is internally appointed as Secretary-General of the Judicial Yuan. (3) Lei Fazhang is internally appointed as Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan.

### Second Phase of U.S. Aid Allotment Will Focus on Cotton; Yan Jiagan Comes to Shanghai to Discuss Special Funds for Economic Construction

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, United Press] According to senior officials of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, a large amount of cotton will be included in the new allocation of supplies to China by the Economic Cooperation Administration during the period from July to September. In the first phase from April to July, one-third of the supplies allocated to China were food, so the food quota in the second phase will be smaller. This is due to the availability of harvestable agricultural products. The Economic Cooperation Agreement signed in Nanjing stipulates improvements in the allocation system, so new guarantees will be obtained in this regard. It was also announced that construction materials or major production tools will not be allocated until the Steelman Industrial Survey Group is expected to complete its work on August 1st. Officials of the Economic Cooperation Administration responsible for allocating supplies to China are still reviewing the list of supplies to be allocated in the future new period and have not yet determined the quantities. But it will apparently exceed the $36 million allotment in the first three-month period that has just ended. The Economic Cooperation Administration revealed that it intends to handle all unfulfilled cotton purchase contracts between China and textile companies, totaling $40 million. The Economic Cooperation Administration will directly ship cotton worth $30 million, and the remaining amount will be supplied by the Chinese government. This type of contract for purchasing U.S. cotton had a precedent in the previous period, when the Economic Cooperation Administration handled contracts totaling $15 million. According to experts, during the longest possible delay in allocating major production tools, the Economic Cooperation Administration will approve the allocation of parts to repair China's existing major production tools. These parts will be handled according to the selection principle. The Economic Cooperation Administration is currently fulfilling orders submitted by various Chinese industries themselves, which have been sent through the Chinese government. However, the Economic Cooperation Administration will list these parts as "goods" rather than "major production tools." According to the authorities, other large quantities of goods that the Economic Cooperation Administration will ship in the new period will be fertilizers and rice. Most of the rice will come from Siam, although it was originally hoped that fertilizers could be purchased from Myanmar. Most of the fertilizers will come from the UK and Belgium, and the Economic Cooperation Administration originally hoped to purchase large quantities of fertilizers from these two countries, but the difficulty lies in China's lack of British pound foreign exchange. At the same time, the Economic Cooperation Administration is deeply willing to purchase fertilizers abroad with gold pounds as much as possible to avoid shipping out the American fertilizers that American farmers urgently need. An Economic Cooperation Administration official said: "The supply of fertilizer is really the best way we can use to increase food production. This is very effective for increasing rice production, but this method is not widely used in China, except in Taiwan Province." Other food shipments will include wheat and flour, but it is expected that the volume of these food shipments will be lower than the volume in the first phase.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Yan Jiagan, liaison commissioner of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, went to Shanghai by night train on the 5th. The main task is to discuss with Lapham whether to change the $68 million special economic construction fund from U.S. aid. When the U.S. Congress's aid to China plan stipulated that $60 million would be used for China's economic construction, the total amount of aid to China loans was $463 million. It has now been reduced to $400 million, so whether the $60 million figure has changed still needs to be negotiated by both parties. Yan has received instructions from the government, and it is reported that Lapham will also ask Hoffman for instructions.

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 5th] The Steelman Survey Group, led by Hansted and accompanied by Jia Beilei, Mao Yisheng, and others, arrived in Hangzhou at around 5:00 PM.

### Negotiations of Bilateral Agreements

### More Than 100 Legislative Yuan Members Propose Announcing the Facts of Soviet Treaty Violations and Advocate Making Serious Representations

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Legislative Yuan member Pan Chaoying and 135 others recently proposed a "proposal to request the government to announce the facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in order to correct international perceptions and clarify right and wrong." The reasons for the proposal first cited the official statements repeatedly made by our government that the Soviet Union has not earnestly implemented the treaty, explaining that the Soviet Union's violation of the treaty has caused our country to suffer considerable losses in the Northeast after the victory in the war against Japan, and that its assistance to the Communist bandits has created the serious situation in the country today. The proposal criticized the diplomatic authorities' "complete silence," saying that in the "anti-aggression" suppression war, our country should no longer remain silent on the facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the treaty, infringement of rights, and aiding the Communist bandit rebellion. The proposal lists two measures: "(1) The Legislative Yuan should request the government to announce the various facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. (2) Make serious representations to the Soviet Union, and if it still has no effect, file a complaint with the United Nations."

[Another Dispatch] It is confirmed that the "plan to improve Sino-Soviet relations" listed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy plan for this year is still based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, "requiring the resolution of various Sino-Soviet issues."

### Thousands of Students from Northeast China Arrive in Beiping; Destroy the Beiping Municipal Council; Fu Zuoyi Announces that Beiping Has Been Placed Under Martial Law Since Yesterday

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 5th] Students from Northeast China in Beiping, in opposition to the Beiping Municipal Council's decision to train Northeast Chinese students, gathered over 6,000 people today, destroying the Municipal Council on Fuqian Street, and after 2:00 PM, went to Dongjiaomin Lane to surround the residence of Speaker Xu Huidong. The situation had not been resolved by the time this dispatch was sent. Starting at around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, Northeast Chinese students scattered inside and outside the city set off separately. Wherever they passed at 9:00 AM, they used chalk to write slogans, mostly against military training, against joining the army, demanding food, and demanding education, and they heavily criticized the Municipal Council. By 9:00 AM, two large groups of students from the southwest and northwest cities converged at the south entrance of Nanchang Street, totaling 14 units, approximately over a thousand male and female students. The large group marched mightily towards the Municipal Council to question them. No one from the council dared to come forward. The students rushed in and destroyed the messenger's office, the councilor's lounge, the offices, the staff dormitories, the doors, windows, and miscellaneous items. Subsequently, Bai Shiwei, the acting director of the police bureau, invited Chen Kefu, chairman of the preparatory committee for the Northeastern Provisional University, and Pang Ying, the director of student affairs of Northeastern University, to the scene to mediate. Chen and Pang spoke and advised, but both were ineffective. The students rushed into the Municipal Council again and destroyed the meeting place. At noon, they went to Vice President Li's residence to petition. At 2:30 PM, they crowded into Speaker Xu's residence in Dongjiaomin Lane, clashing with the military and police who were trying to dissuade them. As a result, over 20 soldiers and police were killed or injured, and three petitioners were killed and over ten were injured. They dispersed at around 8:00 PM. Fu Zuoyi has announced that Beiping is under martial law.

### Students from Various Middle Schools in Kunming Forcibly Occupy Yunnan University

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 5th] The Yunnan University authorities telegraphed the provincial government on the 5th, stating that the students from various middle schools who forcibly occupied the university have recently become even more reckless, forcibly moving entirely into the classrooms, offices, and reading rooms of Huize Building (the main part of the school, built to commemorate Tang Jiyao), using the building as a fortress, arbitrarily piling up and destroying all the wooden furniture, and transporting over 6,000 bricks and tiles to the upper floors, breaking them into pieces, seemingly for use in attacks. Over 800 catties of lime have also been transported to the upper floors, packed into small paper bags, seemingly for use as offensive weapons. In addition, a large amount of sulfuric acid stored in the basement has also been stolen and transported upstairs, seemingly for use in vicious fights. The danger posed by the students' actions is unimaginable. It is requested that your government inform the Department of Education and instruct the responsible persons of each school to inspect Huize Building together with personnel from our school and order all students to move out.

### Editorial: The Stumbling Block to a Peace Conference with Japan

Recently, both the Legislative and Control Yuans have held meetings proposing the convening of a peace conference with Japan, and suggested that our government adopt proactive diplomacy to strive for the convocation of such a conference. Public opinion has also responded with enthusiastic welcome to this constructive proposal, generally believing that only the convening of a peace conference can thoroughly clarify the settlement of the Japan issue. The diplomatic authorities have treated this issue with great caution. On June 4th, Vice Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao issued a statement to the Central News Agency, expressing the attitude of our government. The main points of Yeh's statement are twofold: (1) Listing the process of negotiations for preliminary peace conference meetings, explaining the differences in attitude between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and stating that our country has fulfilled its due responsibilities in various negotiations. This has been the case in the past, and in the future, we should continue to seek the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan based on a consistent stance. (2) Regarding the draft peace treaty with Japan, our government has been constantly preparing and conducting in-depth research since Japan's surrender. If the convocation of the peace conference is in sight, our country's draft peace treaty can be submitted immediately. According to Yeh's statement, our government has not only fulfilled its due responsibilities for the convocation of the peace conference, but also made thorough preparations for the draft peace treaty. Our country bears no responsibility for the preliminary peace conference meetings being stalled and not convened.

A "peace treaty" is a document that restores peaceful relations between warring countries. The conclusion of a peace treaty is the normal way to end international wars, with few exceptions. Therefore, it is said that a peace treaty is the final chapter of a war. After World War II, neither the major peace treaty with Germany nor the major peace treaty with Japan has been concluded; the major peace conferences with Germany and Japan have both been stalled due to disputes over procedural issues. A peace treaty is a document agreed upon and produced by a peace conference. If the convocation of the peace conference is nowhere in sight, the peace treaty cannot be concluded, which is a natural phenomenon. Why can't the peace conference be convened? The facts of the past two years fully illustrate the rise of power politics, with the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union having plunged the entire international political arena into a state of fear and suspicion. In the case of the peace treaty with Germany, the foreign ministers of the four countries have discussed it many times without result, and even regarding the procedural issues of the peace conference, the Soviet Union has refused China the right to participate. The procedures of the peace conference are filled with complex and gloomy phenomena, so there is naturally no discussion of the substantive content of the peace treaty. In the case of the peace conference with Japan, China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have three different views on the procedural issues: the United States and Britain advocate that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission that fought against Japan jointly draft the peace treaty, and that resolutions be passed by a two-thirds majority; the Soviet Union advocates that the foreign ministers of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union be responsible for drafting the peace treaty and convening the peace conference, and that the four countries retain the right of veto; our country compromises on the above two views, advocating that the eleven countries participate in the preliminary peace conference meetings, but that the majority of votes passed in the meetings should include China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have vastly different opinions on our country's views, resulting in nearly a year of negotiations failing to be completed smoothly. This is not because our country has not fulfilled its responsibility to mediate, but because it is difficult for the United States and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement, and they have missed the good opportunity to convene the peace conference at an early date.

What the United States and the Soviet Union are fighting over regarding the Japanese peace conference is the veto power issue, which is a procedural issue of the peace conference and has not yet touched on the content of the draft peace treaty. Originally, the peace treaty is the substance, and the peace conference is the form. In theory, the substantive content is more important than the form; however, allied politicians today are willing to argue about the form and neglect the content, which is regrettable! Our government has a definite stance on the form of the peace conference, and has also made full preparations for the content of the peace treaty, and has never been shaken by the dangerous phenomena of the "Cold War" between the United States and the Soviet Union. In general, our country's attitude is relatively firm and has a consistent style. Our country's firm attitude is much more progressive than that of Britain; the shrewd and calculating British Foreign Secretary Bevin has already admitted to the world his mistakes and failures in handling the issue of convening the Japanese peace conference. Last November, in order to break the deadlock in the peace conference, our government submitted a memorandum to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, harmonizing the differing opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union, and hoping for a compromise solution to promote the success of the peace conference. Strangely, Britain not only did not adopt our country's compromise plan, but instead cursed it, with complaints arising from all sides. The prestigious London Times even criticized our country in its January 6th editorial for "refusing to adopt the same stance as the Western powers." Even Australian officials attacked our country's compromise plan, which is a pity! Yet, not long after, Australia changed its tune and loudly called for the convening of a peace conference with Japan. British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech at the Labour Party's annual conference and his foreign policy report in Parliament also fully revealed the urgency of demanding the convening of a peace conference with Japan, and the Times' editorials were completely different from half a year ago.

The facts listed above illustrate the firmness of our country's attitude and the hesitation of Britain's attitude. The development of the facts over the past six months illustrates the correctness of our country's stance, which has not been shaken by the dangerous signs of the international Cold War. If Britain had supported our country's compromise plan last November, the United States and the Soviet Union would definitely have accepted it without objection, and the preliminary meetings of the peace conference with Japan would not have been stalled until today. Now that the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming more intense, and the United States' policy of supporting Japan is in danger of going astray, Britain, Australia, and other countries are deeply fearful and worried about the future of peace in the Far East. Can this not be said to be Britain's own fault?

In conclusion, our country has suffered deeply from the harm and poison of Japanese aggression for the past fifty years. Regardless of age, location, or profession, everyone has the same feeling and the same reason, demanding the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the fair and thorough settlement of the Japan issue, and the establishment of a grand plan for a hundred years of peace in the Far East. After reading Vice Minister Yeh's statement, we believe that our country's firm stance on the peace conference with Japan is absolutely correct; however, for the sake of national security and peace in the Far East, we still hope that the government authorities will continue to promote the realization of the preliminary meetings of the peace treaty with Japan, and deal with the various issues of the peace treaty with Japan with a proactive spirit, to live up to the expectations of the people of the whole country. At the same time, we also hope that the people of the whole country will unanimously support the government as a backing, to fully support the government's policy towards Japan and cope with this complex and volatile international environment.

### A Tense Scene at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly: Wei Daoming Responds to Interpellations, Defends Public Enterprises and Arson Case

[This newspaper, Taipei, 5th] The 5th general meeting of the Provincial Assembly entered a tense stage today. After Chairman Wei's general report on administration at 8 a.m., the councilors raised interpellations one after another. Liu Kuocai, Li Yousan, Lin Bihui, and Ma Yue criticized the huge expenditures of public enterprises and expressed doubts about personnel management and revenue and expenditure. Chen Maodi and Yang Tianfu pointed out the meager treatment of public teachers and the rectification of corruption and incompetence. Huang Liandeng and Lu Yongkai, due to the tragic New Taipei City Xindian River car burning case, requested the dismissal of Railway Bureau Chief Lang Zhonglai, saying that the bureau's revenue was used for useless consumption instead of road construction, treating human lives as if they were grass. They also mentioned that Lang Zhonglai abused his power when he first took office, using 160 private individuals, of which only 62 were technical personnel, and the rest were administrative personnel, causing the employees to be unable to work with peace of mind. Moreover, the newly appointed personnel spent 100,000 to 200,000 public funds as travel expenses. I don't know whether the bureau's budget has been approved by the provincial government. Lu Yongkai also provided a list on the spot as evidence of abuse of private individuals. Chairman Wei orally answered all the inquiries. He said that the board of directors should be responsible for the revenue and expenditure management of public enterprises, and that the so-called huge expenditures are because there is no subsidy requirement for provincial finance, and it is necessary to restore general preparation, which is the basis for a large increase in production in the future. As for the treatment of public teachers, due to limited financial resources, he hoped to provide evidence for the rectification of corruption, which will be severely dealt with. Next, when discussing the arson case, Wei tried his best to support the Railway Bureau, saying that the cause of the disaster was the passengers carrying gunpowder, and the responsibility did not seem to lie with the Railway Bureau. Punishing the bureau chief is an unfair and unreasonable act, which has a bad impact on administrative efficiency. Moreover, the personnel involved are already under investigation by the court, and the issue of responsibility will not be difficult to find out. As for the issue of Director Lang's abuse of private individuals and abuse of public funds, Wei said that he heard about it for the first time today, but judging from the great progress in road administration, the daily freight volume has increased from 12,000 tons to 17,000 tons, and the revenue has also increased by one-third, which is enough to show that he has not failed in his duties. Replacing personnel and increasing efficiency, then the act of replacing is necessary. Wei said at the end that Director Lang was intimidated before taking office, and the intention is obvious. He hoped that the arson incident would not be confused with Director Lang's personal issues. The conference in the afternoon was a civil affairs report and interpellation.

### The Ministry of Water Resources Approved the Allocation of Funds to Dredge the Quanhe River in Anhui: The Budget of Over 100 Billion Will Start Construction Soon

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Water Resources has recently approved the allocation of 45 billion yuan to carry out the dredging project of the Quanhe River in Anhui. The Quanhe River originates from the western border of Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, and flows eastward into Anhui Province, passing through Linquan County and entering the Shuiying River at Sanliwan in Fuyang County, with a total length of about 130 kilometers and a drainage area of about 2,000 square kilometers. Before the Yellow River flooded into the Huai River, the original river channel could still accommodate the floods and would not cause harm, so there was no embankment. Small boats could also pass from Sanliwan to Linquan County. The land in the basin is fertile and the agricultural products are abundant. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the Yellow River flooded into the Ying River and entered the Huai River. The river channel from Sanlihai upstream to near Tangzhuang, about 14 kilometers long, gradually silted up due to backflow and top support. It has been more than eight years, so that the entire river channel is completely blocked and turned into flat ground. Although temporary repairs were made to the downstream embankment during the Yellow River flood, the water from the upstream and the accumulated water in the vicinity were not easy to discharge smoothly, so floods were still unavoidable, and more than 150,000 mu of farmland on both sides were flooded, and the annual losses were difficult to calculate. Now the Yellow River has long returned to its old course, but the tail water of the upstream has lost its tailboard, and the harm is as before. Moreover, the area has been repeatedly harassed by bandits, and the people are in dire straits. In order to relieve the people and increase production, and to facilitate shipping, it is urgently needed to dredge the area with work for relief. It is estimated that the earthwork is about 624.198 cubic meters. Together with the expenses of mechanics, miscellaneous workers, and materials, it will cost more than 137 billion yuan. The Ministry of Water Resources has approved the advance allocation of 45 billion yuan of national currency, instructing the Huaihe River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau to consult with the local military and political organs to organize a construction organization, and start construction soon to carry out the dredging. In addition, the benefit of afforestation is closely related to water conservancy. The Ministry of Water Resources has issued a notice to its subordinate agencies to pay special attention to afforestation this year. According to the Huaihe River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, the Huaihe River Basin Restoration Embankment Engineering Bureau reported that the willow planting and embankment protection work of the bureau's various engineering offices this year is summarized as follows: the willows planted in the past have mostly grown alive, a total of 146,210 trees.

### Berlin Deadlock Unbreakable: Three Powers Decide to Send Note to the Soviet Union; Soviet Commander Hints at Taking Action Against Airlift

[United Press, London, 5th]  The three powers, Britain, America, and France, are facing a diplomatic showdown with the Soviet Union over the Berlin blockade.  The confrontation will take place in Moscow when the Western ambassadors present a demand to the highest Soviet officials for the lifting of the Berlin blockade.  It is anticipated that within a few days, the West, either collectively or individually, will send a similar note to Moscow.  Well-informed sources believe that the Soviet reply will suggest a resumption of the four-power high-level meeting, or a reopening of the four-power foreign ministers' conference. The Soviet side has made such suggestions repeatedly in recent weeks.  Britain and France will undoubtedly agree to this, but the United States will insist on a guarantee of a new basis for negotiations before the meeting is resumed.  [Reuters, London, 5th]  A Foreign Office spokesman has confirmed that British, French, and American representatives have drafted a unanimous, solemn note to the Soviet Union in London, protesting against the Soviet blockade of West Berlin. A dispatch from Washington states that State Department officials revealed that the note has been drafted but has not yet been presented to the Soviet Union. However, it will be delivered to Moscow no later than Wednesday. Before it is delivered, the content of the note will not be made public.  It is also rumored that Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the German Occupation Forces, Sokolovsky, sent a letter to the three-power commanders-in-chief within 24 hours after meeting with them on Saturday, but this has not been confirmed.  The British spokesman stated that General Robertson had not received any formal letter from the Soviet side. [Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky today protested to the British, American, and French commanders-in-chief, stating that the three powers' airlift to Berlin was a violation of German aviation regulations, hinting that it would be restricted. Sokolovsky's letter directly pointed out that the Western allies' air activities were contrary to all agreed-upon agreements governing Berlin's aviation and must be stopped. The reaction of the Allied side to Sokolovsky's move is that the Soviet Union's blockade of West Berlin by land will be extended to the air. Allied sources also said that the only way for the Soviet Union to stop the Allied airlift would be to set up barrage balloons. In such circumstances, the British and Americans would order their air forces to shoot them down. If they did, the Soviet side might retaliate, thus causing the first exchange of fire. The Western allies have been operating the airlift between Berlin and West Germany for five days without interruption. Allied sources also stated that the Western countries would not cancel the airlift system because of Sokolovsky's protest and that the Allies' joint protest letter to the Soviet Union was about to be delivered to Moscow. It is expected that Sokolovsky's protest will be ignored.

### Foreign Minister Bevin States Firmly: Britain Will Not Yield to the Soviet Union; Plans to Send Giant Airships to Assist in Transporting Grain

[Reuters, London, 4th]  Foreign Minister Bevin, in a speech today in Wymondham, Suffolk, stated that if the Soviet Union is willing, Britain is very willing to discuss the Berlin situation.  But he will not allow the starvation of 2.5 million people in Berlin to be used as a tool of Soviet policy, just as he will not allow the blockade to force the British people to submit.  He hopes that everyone can maintain their rationality and determination, so that they can finally achieve their long-term goals and find a final solution to the German problem. Bevin also strongly emphasized that the Western powers are in Berlin based on their rights and will not yield because the Soviet side is using the starvation of Germans as a weapon, thus allowing the Soviet Union to achieve its goals. The amount of air transport to Berlin will increase day by day, making it difficult for the means of using famine as a weapon to succeed. [Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Britain plans to send ten Sunderland-class giant airships to increase the airlift between West Germany and Berlin. Each of these airships can carry four tons of cargo and will travel between the Elbe River's Linnewitt and Berlin's Havel Lake. Today, 96 British aircraft and 181 American aircraft landed in Berlin in six hours.

[Agence France-Presse, Lauenburg, 4th] According to boatmen who arrived in Lauenburg today, the port of Wimberg on the Elbe River is crowded with ships hoping to transport grain to Berlin. These ships are all being detained by the Soviet side, and sometimes even empty ships are not allowed to depart.

### Collective Farm System Not Applicable to Czechoslovakia; The Principle of "Land to the Tiller" Is Still Implemented

[Associated Press, Czech Capital, 4th] Communist Prime Minister Zapotocky said today that the Soviet collective farm system is not applicable to Czechoslovakia. After the Cominform criticized Yugoslavia for favoring farmers, rumors spread that Czechoslovakia would implement the collective system. In fact, this is not the case. Land to the tiller is our principle. Although the constitution guarantees freedom of belief and religion, every citizen must obey the laws of the state, and the church cannot oppose the state.

### Soviet Foreign Policy: Internal Discord

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] Journalists and observers who are consistently well-informed now believe that the policies of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Cominform leader Zhdanov are in conflict with each other. They recall that although Yugoslavia was condemned by the Cominform, it still participated in the East European and Soviet foreign ministers' meeting held in Warsaw. And Tito seems to believe that he can appeal to some force in the Soviet Union to support his opposition to the Cominform's criticism. The journalist said that a conflict between Molotov and Zhdanov is very possible because the two are potential contenders to succeed Stalin. The Cominform is now gradually pursuing its own independent foreign policy, which is unprofessional and lacks coordination, so it has caused Molotov a great headache, especially when he is fully engaged in dealing with the Berlin crisis.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 5th] Wu Bosheng, the Chinese Consul-General in Singapore, who returned to China to report on the Malayan situation, said here that the British government is now doing its best to suppress terrorist activities in Malaya. The communists in Malaya are still carrying out their consistent policies of sabotage and destruction, causing an "epidemic" of assassinations of Chinese and Europeans to sabotage the British government's economic institutions. The terrorists are originally part of the wartime forest guerrillas. They were armed by the Japanese before the surrender, and their power became stronger. A year ago, they extorted money from the Chinese. Due to the threatening nature of their activities, the police decided to suppress all underground activities. Wu is scheduled to return to his post in Singapore at the end of July.

### Bangkok Has Become a Communist Base in Southeast Asia

The Soviet Union Establishes a Large-Scale Embassy in Bangkok

[Associated Press, Bangkok, 4th] A new base for communist activities in Southeast Asia seems to be forming in Bangkok. The Soviet Union is planning to establish a large-scale embassy in Bangkok with more than 40 staff members. There are only about ten Soviet citizens in all of Thailand, so each citizen has at least four diplomatic representatives. Soviet Ambassador Netchina and his staff are staying in a large hotel in Bangkok and have begun distributing news releases to various newspapers. This situation cannot escape the attention of Western diplomats. Before returning to the United States last week, US Ambassador Stanton told the Associated Press that Moscow is not only playing tricks in Europe and China, but the situation in Malaya has attracted worldwide attention. If all of Southeast Asia becomes a solid anti-Soviet group, it will be of great importance to the world. Before leaving, Stanton visited Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, who told him that Thailand would not be controlled by the Communist Party, but there were undoubtedly many communists among the overseas Chinese.

I hope the Arabs can clearly see that if they do not agree to the extension of the truce, they will be seen by the world as indirectly willing to have war in the Holy Land rather than peace. Whichever side fires the first shot on Friday, when the truce expires, will be seen by the world as the main person responsible for the failure of the United Nations' peace efforts."

### Britain Implements Social Insurance System, National Care from Cradle to Grave, No Worries About Birth, Old Age, Sickness, Death, or Unemployment

[British News Agency, London, 4th Dispatch] The National Health and Insurance Act and the Town and Country Planning Act have come into effect on the 5th. Britain's post-war social reform has thus opened a new era, and the living standards of countless people have been improved as a result. This world-leading and unparalleled social security system enables all men, women, old, and young in Britain to face the daily dangers and responsibilities of life without fear or worry. They are indeed cared for from cradle to grave. On the one hand, local health authorities are responsible for the welfare of pregnant women and mothers; on the other hand, under the insurance system under the new Insurance Act, there is a funeral grant for the deceased. Everyone has insurance against so-called "income interruption," which refers to accidents, unemployment, and old age. In case of illness, not only the person concerned but also their wife and children receive "allowances." There is no need to worry about medical expenses; the National Medical Service provides all necessary treatments, medicines, or, if necessary, hospitalization and surgery. Finally, after retirement in old age, both husband and wife receive pensions. There are over 20 million insured workers nationwide. The establishment of this insurance institution is mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of National Insurance, according to the new Health Act. Complementing the national public health is the planning for housing, which will also be comprehensive in the future. In the past, hasty house building sometimes resulted in slums or damage to natural beauty. According to the Town and Country Planning Act, the Minister of Town and Country Planning, Mr. Silkin, now has full power to prevent such mistakes, ensuring that residences are well-organized and most suitable for aesthetics and hygiene.

### Three Members of National Bank Return to Shanghai, Discuss Four Missions to the North, National Treasury Bonds Sold in Beiping and Tianjin, Dumping Goods Causes General Price Decline

[Our Report] Xia Jinxiong, Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank, Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department, and Wang Zhong, Director of the Northeast Region, were dispatched to North China in late June to handle the diversion of idle capital and various economic issues. After staying there for a total of thirteen days, they completed their official duties and returned to Shanghai together on the 4th. When the three met with reporters yesterday, they stated that there were four major tasks in the North: The first was to promote short-term national treasury bonds. After consulting with relevant local agencies, sales in Beiping began on the 26th of last month. The sales agency is the Beiping branch of the Central Bank. There is a lot of idle capital in Tianjin, and there is also a need to sell treasury bonds. After on-site consultations, it was decided to start sales on July 5th. Before leaving Tianjin, they also discussed all technical issues with the persons in charge of the local exchange. The second task was to handle relief work in North China. Commodity prices in Beiping and Tianjin today are much higher than in Shanghai, so people's lives are difficult. After arriving in Beiping and Tianjin, they consulted with local agencies and began dumping materials such as rice, flour, and cotton cloth on the 28th of last month, and personally went to the market to preside over everything. As a result, it was very effective, and commodity prices in North China generally fell.

Exchange Rate Issue

Another task was to study the opening of Shanghai exchange rates. After detailed discussions with relevant local people, it was deeply felt that the restrictions on Shanghai exchange rates in the past were very strict, and cash was still being smuggled in. Therefore, whether Shanghai exchange rates should be opened or not is no longer very relevant. The problem is how to divert idle capital in North China so that it has a proper outlet. The exchange of Northeast currency in Beiping and Tianjin was ordered to be stopped on the 28th of last month by the Mobilization Headquarters. However, it is understood that this move respects the will of the local public opinion organs in order to cope with temporary price fluctuations. According to the entry of circulating currency, it is a natural phenomenon under the different commodity price levels inside and outside the customs. At present, since Shanghai exchange rates are rationally opened, it should be able to reduce the pressure of idle capital on Beiping and Tianjin. In the future, a complete plan will be formulated in the near future on the issue of the exchange of circulating currency, under the principle of taking into account the interests of both Northeast and North China.

Food Issue

The urgent matter dealt with on this trip was the food issue in North China. In order to suppress local grain prices, in addition to the government transporting flour for dumping, this trip also agreed in principle with Commander-in-Chief Chuan that the Central Bank would use yarn to exchange for miscellaneous grains from the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan to supply the needs of North China, avoiding the use of cash to purchase locally in North China, which would stimulate grain prices. As for all technical issues in the promotion, the Director Zheng of the North China Region of the Central Bank is responsible for consulting and resolving with the Suppression Headquarters.

### Public Transportation Companies Request Tripling of Prices, New Telephone Prices to Be Announced Today

Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau is personally reviewing the reasons presented by each company and will convene a meeting to decide on this matter in the coming days. As for the new telephone prices, the difference between the number of increases requested by the company and the number approved by the Public Utilities Bureau was too large, so they could not be announced at the same time as public utilities such as tap water, gas, and electricity. Director Zhao convened the telephone company authorities separately yesterday morning to negotiate. It is heard that opinions have gradually approached, and Director Zhao has submitted the audit opinions to Mayor Wu for approval, which may be approved and announced today.

### Railway Bureau's Pick-Up and Drop-Off Cars No Longer Pick Up Passengers Along the Way

In Accordance with the Regulations of the Public Utilities Bureau

The passenger cars of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau operating in the city refuse to pick up passengers along the way, causing criticism from the outside. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, there are a total of nine passenger cars operating in the city, with three operating routes: one from the North Station to Jing'an Temple, the second from the North Station to South Second Road of Central Justice, and the third from the North Station to the Fishing Market. Because the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau previously stipulated that passenger cars sending passengers from the station to the city are only allowed to let passengers get off the car and are not allowed to get on the car, and passenger cars picking up passengers from the city to the station are only allowed to let passengers get on the car and are not allowed to get off the car. This is to comply with government laws and regulations, but people in the know do not understand the inside story, and it is difficult for us to explain this matter. We are very sorry, he said.

### China National Aviation Corporation-US Air Route Changes Course, Tokyo to Be Used as Stopover

[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation plans to change the route of the China-US air route to pass through Tokyo. After the company's Tokyo office consulted with the Allied Headquarters, the Allied Headquarters agreed to China National Aviation Corporation to make a "technical landing" in Tokyo, but not to load and unload passengers and cargo. Tomorrow (the 7th), the company's China-US flight will follow the new route with Tokyo as a stopover, without having to pass through Guam. This will shorten the journey by 500 miles and save 200 gallons of gasoline. However, this is only a preliminary test. The formal change of course is subject to diplomatic agreements between the Chinese and American governments. In addition, the company's China-Japan route has nothing to do with the change of course on the China-US line. The former has Tokyo as its terminal and can conduct passenger and cargo business. After the trial flight of the route last month, it has been delayed because there are still several minor issues that have not been resolved.

### China National Aviation Corporation Reduces Flights, States Three Hardships

According to China National Aviation Corporation, since the company has reduced the number of flights on some routes, people in various places have felt inconvenienced and have called to request the restoration or increase of flights. Passengers at the Fuzhou station even had a dispute with the ticket seller because of this. However, the company's reasons are: (1) The amount of foreign exchange for oil purchase set by the government is insufficient; (2) The ticket price is too low, and the operating income cannot afford the oil purchase expenses; (3) There is no concrete solution to the exchange settlement problem. It was impossible to make a decision to reduce flights. The restoration can only be considered after the above situation improves. I hope that all sectors of society will understand.

### The Cause of the Tragedy at the Jingjiang Guild Hall

[Report from our newspaper] The Jingjiang Guild Hall building on Dapu Road, South Shanghai, suffered a tragic collapse with deaths and injuries due to the strong winds and rain the day before yesterday. Upon hearing the news, Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, accompanied by Wu Wenhua, the director of the Second District Public Works Management Office, and Chief Wang of the Demolition Section, went to inspect the scene yesterday. It is understood that the building was a one-story house with ten-inch brick walls, built twenty years ago. Due to years of disrepair, some of the wood had rotted, and the brick walls were too long without brick partition walls for support. When a strong wind struck, the tragedy occurred. The remaining buildings are also in a dangerous condition. The bureau is working with the police to advise residents to move out, and will conduct inspections to strengthen the structure to ensure safety.

Advisory to Repair During Hurricane Season

As the hurricane season is approaching, all kinds of building advertisements, walls, and the like in the city are likely to be in danger at any time. The Public Works Bureau earnestly hopes that citizens can inspect them at any time and repair them. If citizens find any dangerous buildings, they can report them to the bureau so that they can send personnel to investigate, give instructions for improvement, and prevent danger.

Comprehensive Inspection of Dangerous Buildings Starts Today

Wu Wenhua, director of the Second District Public Works Management Office of the Public Works Bureau, stated: In order to protect the lives and property of citizens, a comprehensive inspection of dangerous buildings will be launched starting today. The area of inspection for the first day is stipulated to be east of Jin Shenfu Road, south of Aiduya Road, the eastern part of the Old French Concession, and Nanshi, Longhua, Gaochang Temple and other places.

### Opposing the Abolition of the Fisheries Management Office - Telegram to the Legislative Yuan Requesting Impartial Judgment

All Technical Personnel Request the Dispatch of Senior Officials for Thorough Investigation

Representatives of all technical personnel of the Fisheries Rehabilitation and Material Management Office, in order to oppose the advocacy of the abolition of the Fisheries Management Office by a few fishermen and merchants, urgently telegraphed the Legislative Yuan yesterday, requesting an impartial judgment and dispatching senior officials to Shanghai for a thorough investigation, and held a reception for the press to announce the truth of the office's work. The original telegram presented to the Legislative Yuan is recorded below:

To the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan and all the Honorable Members: Recently, a few fishermen and merchants, under the guise of joint names, have advocated the abolition of the Fisheries Management Office on the grounds that it monopolizes fishery relief materials, hoping to achieve their selfish desire of obtaining fishing vessels. We are surprised to hear this. The distribution of fishery relief and rehabilitation materials will soon be discussed by representatives from all provinces at a meeting convened by the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee on the 19th of this month, and a public notice has already been published for the allocation of the first batch of fishing vessels. Therefore, the current task of the Fisheries Management Office can only be to execute the intentions of the superiors and has no power to influence them. We, as fishery technical personnel, have been working at the Fisheries Management Office for two years. Over the past two years, we have made contributions to the advancement of modern fishery in our country, such as the application of American trawling, the success of Qingdao seine net experiments, the expansion of new-style fishing in Kaohsiung, the opening of Tokyo Bay fishing grounds, and the active planning and construction of various processing plants. If the attempt of a few speculative elements in the fishery industry is allowed to succeed, it will inevitably lead to the disintegration of this productive undertaking, which is of crude scale, and the loss of the country's foundation will be even greater. As long as we have a breath, we are determined to deal with them. We have always looked up to the heavy responsibility of the honorable members for the country and to help overcome the difficulties of the times. We urge you to make an impartial judgment and quickly send senior officials to Shanghai for a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. Not only can the administrative measures of the Fisheries Management Office be clarified, but also whether the fishery groups that borrow names are aimed at obtaining fishery materials should also be included in the thorough investigation, so as to avoid the cunning and rebellious elements from succeeding in their plans, and the new fishery of our country can truly benefit from it. The country is fortunate. Representatives of all technical personnel of the Fisheries Rehabilitation and Material Management Office, Yu Kun, Chen Shuyi, Jiang Tongsen, Zhuang Jingkui, Yang Rumei (above are representatives of ship captains), Shi Yubin, Chen Mingsheng, Wang Haoxin, Jin Peifa, Liu Yusheng (above are representatives of chief engineers), Chen Xiubai (representative of processing plant), Liu Jinghan (representative of net factory), Chen Kaihui (above are representatives of fishermen) respectfully bow.

Only Government Agencies Can Assume This Important Task

Representatives of the technical personnel hosted reporters at 5 pm yesterday. Captains Wang Xin, Yang Rumei, Net Factory Liu Jinghan, Chief Engineer Jin Peifa, and Chief Captain Yu Kun successively reported on the office's work. They also stated: Although the distribution of materials should be implemented quickly and practically, for the sake of the entire fishery industry, a portion of fishing vessels and all processing equipment must be retained to complete the development of new fisheries and aquatic product processing industries. Only after this is completed as scheduled can the entire fishery industry of our country be expected to revive. The export of fish products can be exchanged for foreign exchange, because the main equipment of fishing vessels still needs to rely on foreign countries. If there is no export of fish products, the Chinese fishery will never be able to achieve prosperity and benefit the country and the people. However, the post-development and experimental work will require the cooperation of considerable financial resources, manpower, and materials to be successful. Therefore, it must be handled by government agencies and cannot be expected by private companies. Therefore, the Fisheries Management Office should still exist, and so on.

### After the Suspension of Western Films, the Situation Worsens: Domestic Film Manufacturers Compete for Territory, Most Cinemas Suffer Terrible Box Office, Inevitably Bowing to Foreign Merchants Again

[Report from our newspaper] The dispute between the cinema industry and Western film merchants, which has been deadlocked for over a week, has not been resolved as of yesterday because the opinions of both parties have been unable to converge. Since the suspension of new film supplies by Western film merchants on the 29th of last month, the city's first-run cinemas have automatically adjusted ticket prices, and the business strategy has been divided into two factions: Daguangming, Meiqi, Dahua, Cathay and other theaters continue to screen old films, while Nanjing, Da Shanghai and other theaters have switched to negotiating with some smaller Western film manufacturers to exchange films. As a result, the former can still be full, while the latter's box office is less than 30%. According to a survey and research report by various cinemas, it is believed that the increase in ticket prices, the decline in general purchasing power, and the different locations of the cinemas are the main reasons for the significant differences in business. However, the audience's choice and love or dislike of the film content is still the basic reason for determining the cinema's business. Therefore, in the distress of not being able to obtain high-quality new Western films, they are quite willing to sign contracts with domestic film manufacturers in order to save the critical situation. However, the city's twelve film production manufacturers are competing for territory, each aiming for cinemas with better equipment, and none are willing to give in, which has caused new undercurrents to rise before the previous waves have subsided. According to various first-run cinemas, there is still a problem: Western film merchants complain that the ticket prices are too low, saying that they do not cover costs, while domestic film merchants complain that the prices are too high, saying that it is difficult to attract audiences. Cinemas have been forced to a dead end. Therefore, if the disputes between domestic film merchants themselves cannot be resolved in the future, they will have to bow to Western film merchants again and request cooperation in order to take care of their own business. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau is convening a meeting of cinemas, Western film merchants, and domestic film merchants to discuss solutions.

### Shen Bao Continues to Hold Scholarships - Fundraising for Funds Starts Today

The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Committee, in view of the recent soaring prices and declining people's livelihood, anticipates that tuition fees in various schools will increase sharply in the next semester, and the situation of impoverished students dropping out of school will become more serious.

For all weddings, funerals, and celebrations, we can save money to help students; industrial and commercial groups, share the hardships of the times, save on entertainment expenses, and fill the scholarship fund; the meaning is profound, and nothing is better than this. In order to maintain the value of the currency and provide generous interest, the committee plans to purchase short-term treasury bills with the scholarship donations received, and announce them at any time to show its great credibility.

### The Owner of the Sanyi Tea Plantation in Taiwan Province Embezzles Large Sums of Money - Abandons His Post and Flees to Hong Kong, Comes to Shanghai and Is Arrested - Escorted Awaiting Transfer by the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office

[Report from our newspaper] The owner of the Sanyi Tea Plantation affiliated to the Tea Branch of the Taiwan Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Co., Ltd. is Shen Da, a Cantonese man, 28 years old. After taking office in September last year, he appointed his wife, Shen Zhang Yun, as the commissioner and cashier of the tea plantation. At the beginning of his tenure, the tea plantation began to plant citronella tea, with a budget of about NT$4.5 million. This amount was soon received by the tea plantation from the company and planned to be lent to general tea farmers. However, at that time, the tea farmers did not need the funds, so the funds were kept by the tea plantation. Unexpectedly, Shen Da failed in his partnership in business with friends, resulting in huge losses, and secretly misappropriated the funds to make up for the losses. As a result, the company authorities discovered it at the end of the year. Shen Da, upon hearing the news, feared being arrested for the incident, and abandoned his post and fled to Hong Kong in January this year, not daring to show his face. His wife left Taiwan in November and came to Shanghai. After the incident, the company immediately sent Tao Shiyong, the director of the General Affairs Section, to Shanghai to negotiate with Shen Da's father, Shen Zhaoxiong. However, Shen's father, who works for the Nanyang Enterprise Company, had a meager income and was unable to repay this huge sum of money, resulting in repeated delays and no resolution by May of this year. At that time, Shen Da felt extremely depressed in Hong Kong, so he sneaked back to Shanghai and lived at No. 23, Lane 328, Haining Road, Hongkou. The Taiwan Provincial Police Department learned of this from the company's report and telegraphed the Municipal Police Bureau to request his arrest. The Police Bureau arrested Shen at the address on May 26. After being transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, he was interrogated in court on the 5th of last month. Shen confessed to misappropriating public funds. Just as the office was planning to file a public prosecution, it suddenly received a letter from the Taiwan Provincial District Prosecutor's Office, stating that the case had been accepted and requesting that Shen be transferred to Taiwan. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office has now put the case on hold. Although it has been urged repeatedly, no one from the Taiwan Provincial District Prosecutor's Office has been sent to Shanghai to escort him.

### Prelude to the Battle of Eastern Hebei: The Grain-Grabbing Frenzy

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Han Qingtao

[Aviation dispatch from Qinhuangdao to this newspaper, 1st] By mid-June, the wheat ears had turned yellow across the fields of Eastern Hebei. The farmers' sweat and toil had produced the fruits of survival, and it was time for the harvest. However, at this moment, the unfortunate "grain-grabbing war" erupted, which also served as a prelude to the entire war in Eastern Hebei.

Initially, the local Communist forces massively collected scissors, carrying baskets, mules, and large carts, and organized large grain-grabbing teams of men and women. Under the cover of local armed forces, they entered the wheat fields and cut off the wheat ears along the rows. Acre after acre was quickly cleared. Basket after basket of wheat ears was quickly carried and pulled back to the Communist-controlled areas.

Such large-scale plundering and disturbance rendered the farmers' half-year of hard work futile. The issue of food supply arose. The National Army and local militia also had plans to protect the wheat harvest, but ultimately these plans were not implemented effectively. Furthermore, the Communists exploited the weakness of the National Army and local militia being forced into point-to-line defense, allowing the Communists to plunder at their leisure. No wonder the farmers suffered greatly and the local losses were immense.

Eating Small Strongholds

Before the wave of grain-grabbing rose, Lin Biao's Eighth Column, Eleventh Column, and Nie Rongzhen's Fourth Column, Second Column Fourth Brigade, and other units, attacking Chengde, hurriedly sneaked into the Great Wall. Led by units under Nie Neng, they attacked Tangshan and Guye, industrial and mining bases in North China, but did not gain any advantage. Secondly, they decided on a plan to attack small and large strongholds along the Eastern Hebei railway line.

The Communists' plan was to first capture small strongholds on the Eastern Hebei railway line, then take larger strongholds, in order to be able to maneuver freely. To the west, they set up a command post at Hujia Huangling, north of Shimen; to the east, they set up a command post at Daxia Shengang, fifteen kilometers west of Qinhuangdao, and separately attacked the east and west areas of Changli.

East of the Luan River, the Tenth Brigade of Nie's Fourth Column was to attack Shimen, the Eleventh Brigade to attack Anshan, and the Twelfth Brigade to attack Houfengtai. The Fourth Brigade of the Second Column served as a mobile force. Lin's Eighth Column, attached with an independent artillery regiment and a cavalry battalion, was to capture Changli. The remaining local armed forces, such as the Second and Third Regiments of the Twelfth Military Sub-district, the Ninth Regiment of the Thirteenth Military Sub-district, and the county battalions, were to cooperate in the operations.

Lin's Eleventh Column stayed east of Changli, attacking Liushouying in Beidaihe and supporting the Communists attacking Changli, and then planning to take Qinhuangdao. Once the Communist deployment was complete, they began to move south from Lulong and Funing. On the morning of the 23rd, they had reached larger strongholds north of the railway. At night, they approached the railway, and the attack began after midnight, on the 24th. After five or six hours of battle, the Communists in the west captured Houfengtai, Anshan, and Shimen stations west of Changli. In the center, there was fierce fighting in Changli. In the east, they captured Chenjiazhuang, a small station near Changli. Liushouying and Beidaihe were firmly defended by the Twelfth Traffic Police Regiment, and remained unshaken.

The battle of Changli began in the surrounding areas. The traffic police defending the city fought the Communists for a day. On the afternoon of the 24th, they were forced to withdraw from the suburbs and hilltop fortresses, and defended the city and the station. The county security militia fought a hard battle with the Communists at Hongqiao in the southern suburbs. Later, they were unable to hold out and planned to retreat into the city. At this time, the traffic police defending the city had blocked the city gates, so the security militia changed course and went to Luan County.

The traffic police defending the city were the Fifth and Eighth Regiments, mostly equipped with new "Thompson" submachine guns. A lot of money had also been spent on the fortifications in Changli, which were built to look impressive. The only thing lacking for the defending troops was heavy weaponry. The Communist Eighth Column attacked the city all night, with dense artillery fire. Before dawn on the 25th, the north gate was first breached, and then Communists also infiltrated the east and west gates. Most of the traffic police withdrew to the south gate, preparing to retreat. According to the civilians who escaped, "Tang Yisheng, the commander of the traffic police detachment, said to the two regimental commanders: Changli must be defended. Watch me, Tang, commit suicide before you retreat." Unfortunately, the situation was hopeless, and most of the traffic police broke through the south gate. At 11 a.m. on the 25th, the Communists gained control of the entire city wall. Changli was again occupied by the Communists on May 18th of last year.

Around Changli

East of Changli, although the strength of the National Army was weak, the battle lasted the longest. It can be said that the National Army was quite successful in this area. The reason for the success was not only the strong defense of the defending troops, but also the rapid arrival of reinforcements. Fan Hanjie's command in Qinhuangdao certainly had a great relationship.

The battle started like this: Before June 23, the Jin-Yu Railway outside the pass was first cut off. Although the military authorities constantly received reports of thousands of Communists being discovered here and thousands of Communists being discovered there, they did not consider it very accurate, and only made preparations to pay attention.

On the morning of the 23rd, the security militia captured several Communists. From the Communists' confessions, the authorities knew that something unusual was happening. They immediately ordered all localities to strengthen their vigilance. At night, the Communists approached the railway. At 2:00 a.m. on the 24th, when the moon and stars were sparse, gunfire and artillery sounded around Qinhuangdao. Later, mixed with the dense gunfire, there were also explosions. Thus, from the Luan River in the west to Qinhuangdao in the east, a line of about two hundred li was under attack.

The morning of the 24th was the most intense period of the battle in the east. The battle was fiercest at Nandasi, a small station nine kilometers west of Qinhuangdao. The navy also fired continuously. At this time, Qinhuangdao was shrouded in artillery fire. In order to keep the Communists away, the authorities set up a command post at Nandasi, personally commanded by He Shili, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region. There were repeated advances and retreats at first, but later they gained a slight advantage. At night, He even rode a small railway armored car to the front to supervise the battle. On the morning of the 25th, reinforcements arrived from Huludao, and the morale was even higher. However, the Communists stubbornly resisted at "Muzhai" and "Caigezhuang" north of the railway between Beidaihe and Nandasi. After another two days of fierce fighting on the 25th and 26th, the Communists were driven back. Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao were able to be connected together.

On the 27th and 28th, the National Army advanced further, driving the Communists north of the railway between Beidaihe and Liushouying. The Communists wavered and began to retreat north. Because the National Army adopted a pincer attack tactic, the Eighth Army and other units advancing east from Guye recovered Shimen on the 27th, captured Anshan on the 28th, and entered Houfeng Temple on the 29th, immediately followed by the recovery of Changli County, which had been occupied by the Communists for five days. It was originally planned that the National Army from the east and west would meet in Changli on the 28th. However, because the resistance in the east was too great, the eastern route only captured Chenjiazhuang Station at noon on the 29th, and was able to meet with the two routes of the National Army in the afternoon. The battle of Eastern Hebei was considered to have come to an end.

The Beining Railway from Jin-Yu section, east of the Luan River, was severely damaged. Fortunately, the "Luan River Bridge," which everyone was concerned about, was heavily guarded and only hit by a few Communist shells, so the damage was small and quickly repaired. Some of the other bridges had temporary pontoon bridges, while others had sleepers laid. The general facilities were easily repaired. It was estimated that it could be rushed through around July 3rd or 4th. Regarding the losses of railway personnel, it is now known that Deputy Stationmaster Wang of Chenjiazhuang Station and others died in their posts. Some were also released after being captured.

Changli suffered the greatest losses in this battle. The Communists looted a lot of supplies and obtained many weapons. Even more grain was plundered in the area west of Changli and east of the Luan River. According to aerial reconnaissance, the Communists used hundreds of carts to transport supplies north, and the quantity was considerable. However, the Communists suffered many casualties in Changli and in the areas east and west of Changli. The Communists did not care about the casualties as long as they obtained the supplies.

### A Romantic Marriage in Wumen: Aged Groom with White Braid Hanging Low; Old Virgin Learning to Be a Bride

[Dispatch from Suzhou to this newspaper, 4th] Cao Yuanbi, a local of Suzhou, is 86 years old and the younger brother of Cao Cangzhou, a Qing Dynasty imperial physician. He passed the imperial examinations in his youth and was awarded the title of Hanlin by the Guangxu Emperor in the 34th year of his reign. He has devoted himself to the study of classics and history and is blind. His wives, Tang and Wang, have both passed away. Recently, due to a lack of care, he asked a matchmaker to find him another wife. On the 4th, the wedding ceremony was held at his residence in Suzhou. The bride, surnamed Chai, is a 56-year-old virgin. The aged groom had his white braid hanging low, while the bride had her hair cut short to her neck. They bowed awkwardly, and their panting could be heard faintly. The spectators thronged the doors, and the news spread throughout the city.

### A Record of Artifacts Unearthed in Changsha

— Jiang Xuan Yi

[Aviation dispatch from Changsha to this newspaper, 1st] The city of Changsha, Hunan, except for a small area on the north bank of the Xiang River, is surrounded by undulating plains of yellow earth. Initially, when the earth mounds outside the south gate were excavated to level the ground for the construction of the new urban area, a large Han Dynasty tomb in the style of a house was discovered, with three doors that could be entered and exited without obstruction, showing its great height. Later, kiln workers in the suburbs accidentally discovered a medium-sized Han tomb while digging earth to make bricks. The workers thought there were treasures to be unearthed in the soil and dug up the entire tomb, turning it over and over. They also dug up hard pieces of wood.

Tomb Emits Smoke

These pieces of wood were more than ten feet long and weighed about a thousand pounds, making them impossible to transport. They had to turn them over one by one. Underneath the large pieces of wood were wooden planks. When the wooden planks were first lifted, there was a hissing sound, followed by a loud bang and the entire tomb filled with smoke. As a result, two people were injured, and an antique dealer named Qi was imprisoned. The relics in the tomb were scattered everywhere. This type of tomb with large wooden outer coffins is what is known as a Chu tomb from the Zhou Dynasty. At that time, because it was during the Anti-Japanese War, few outsiders knew about it. Only Mr. Ke Qiang, a discerning American, collected a large number of precious and peculiar materials and transported them to Yale University in the United States for exhibition. Due to the unusual nature of the objects, the exhibition was extended for three weeks. Later, Mr. Shang Xiyong stayed in Changsha for a year and also collected a lot. Other than that, no one systematically collected them.

Digging Wells to Steal Treasure

The above two discoveries of ancient tombs can only be considered a beginning. In the six or seven years since then, because artifacts were unearthed in Changsha, the antique shops and stalls along Dongzhan Road suddenly flourished, increasing from one or two to more than fifty. Kiln workers and laborers took this as their profession. Investing merchants used their positions for personal gain and colluded with the laborers, hiring treasure-hunting masters from Henan. Thus began large-scale looting. The treasure-hunting masters from Henan could use an iron rod to strike the ground several feet down, and tell whether there were treasures or ancient tombs underground based on the color of the soil. The treasure-hunting laborers, based on this principle, dug a small well less than one meter in diameter. From the well, they tunneled into ancient tombs five or six fathoms underground to search for more than ten loads of strange antiques.

Hundreds of Tombs Dug Up

A conservative estimate would be that at least a hundred tombs have been dug up, and at least ten thousand artifacts have been unearthed. If you don't believe me, just visit twenty antique stalls on Dongzhan Road in Changsha and you will get an idea. Whether these artifacts are worth a lot of money is another question, but the honesty and lovability of the Hunan people, who do not bring fake antiques to the market, is a fact.

Digging wells to steal treasure is the method used by the villagers. Mr. Ke, the American, used scientific excavation methods to remove the mud and level the ground, excavating the entire tomb architecture and furnishings. Local powerful figures also imitated this method, frankly excavating the entire tomb. However, Ke's excavation had records and photographs, while the excavation by the laborers at the time was only observed and understood at the time, without any records to verify. Because of the above two methods of excavation, everyone knows that there are tombs in the soil, and tombs under tombs. The most common are three layers, from which we know that the three layers of tombs belong to three eras. The bottom layer of the tomb was buried in sediment, and then the top layer of the tomb was buried on top. According to the conversations of kiln workers and laborers, and from the observation of relics, the ancient foundation groups of Changsha, from the Warring States period to the Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are numerous. Unfortunately, the shapes of the discovered objects were not recorded by anyone. Not long ago, you could still see many antiques in Changsha City, truly of all colors and varieties. However, the patterns on the bronze mirrors and lacquerware are unique. Therefore, I decided to collect some of the unwanted leftover broken antiques and spent some time tracing out the restored shapes and patterns, and wrote the research records into two thick volumes of specialized books.

Tomb Structure

The structure of these tombs can be roughly divided into two types: The first type is a wooden outer coffin made of large square wooden strips stacked heavily on top of each other. The cut ends of the large wood are wrapped in silver or tin foil, with the intention of sealing it like tar today. The outer coffin is piled with waste ash like a mountain, completely sealing the wooden outer coffin. The second type is an earthen outer coffin with mud-built walls. From these two forms, it is impossible to determine which form belongs to which era. However, the wooden outer coffin of the first type, because it is sealed tightly, can preserve strange ancient objects such as woodenware, lacquerware, and textiles.

Digging Up Remnants

The common people initially discovered them accidentally, and then there was planned looting. Those with power and influence could dig them up in large quantities. It is said that there is an ancient tomb of a certain imperial concubine west of the city, a Han tomb recorded in the literature. This Han tomb has been attempted by many people, but it has not been dug up yet. The government has also prohibited looting and confiscated hundreds of antiques. However, after a period of time, these locals not only dig new large tombs, but also re-enter the ancient tombs that have been dug up but not completely emptied, once, twice, or three times through tunneling, to extract the remnants. This method of looting is to first open a well-shaped hole, with people standing on both sides of the well. When digging deep, one person stands every two feet, digging up the soil at the bottom and passing it to the second and third people, until they enter the tomb. The most valuable thing for the grave robbers is goldware, followed by bronzeware, so ancient broken clothes, broken armor, broken shoes, etc., are all ruined by them. Among these relics can be divided into wood, lacquer, textiles, bronze, iron, stone, glass, amber, agate, lacquer, realgar, jade, porcelain, pottery, gold, and silver. Due to space limitations, the situation of the unearthed artifacts will be described later. Ancient Mirror Excavated in Changsha (Photo by Jiang Xuanyi)

### Former Chief Secretary of Jurong County Government, Wang Weimin, Indulges in Debauchery and Loses a Gold Brick

[Report from Jurong to this newspaper, 4th] Wang Weimin, another major criminal in the Shi Qimin embezzlement case (former chief secretary during Shi's tenure), stayed with his mistress Hao Fumin (former clerk of the Grain Bureau) in Room 111 of the Pingling Hotel in Liyang around May 25th. It is said that he indulged in debauchery to such an extent that he lost a gold brick (30 taels) in the hotel. The hotel owner (now a staff officer in the Political Work Office of the Yili Command) found it. Later, Wang Weimin came to the hotel to ask for it back. At that time, Wang was the chief secretary of the county, so the owner did not investigate deeply and returned the original item (gold brick of 30 taels). In the end, Wang Weimin was arrested because of the case, and the Yili Command is now investigating the source of the gold brick. It is generally believed that this must be the crystallization of the people's blood and sweat in Jurong County.

When Shi Qimin was ordered by the provincial government to send Zhou Qiwen to guard Wang Weimin, Wang said to Shi, "Wasn't it you who told me to sell the rice?" Shi retorted, "I told you to sell the surplus grain, who told you to sell the tax grain?" Wang had no words to answer. This interlude is quite thought-provoking.

### News in Brief

Zhenjiang

[Report from this newspaper] A prison riot suddenly occurred at 3 p.m. on the 4th in the Zhenjiang Prison of Jiangsu Province. The cause was that the prison guards found a pack of cigarettes in the theft prison. After questioning the detainees, no one would admit it. At that time, more than ten thieves, including Yang Fei, collectively rioted, attempting to break free from their shackles and escape from prison. Fortunately, the guards discovered it and urgently telegraphed military and police agencies to send teams to suppress it. Fortunately, no prisoners escaped.

Xiaoshan

[Report from this newspaper] The hibiscus leaves planted by Wang, a resident of Yinlong Township, in his pond, produced flowers that were twins, equal in size. Also: Rice prices have been approaching the 20 million mark in recent days. The county government continues to run a price-fixing program, and each township is allocated two shi of price-fixed rice based on its security, at a 30% discount from the Linpu market price.

### Military and Police Monitor and Enforce Price Controls Strictly, All Markets Remain Stagnant

Yesterday morning, the inspection department of the Garrison Command, together with the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau and the precinct police stations, continued to monitor the cotton yarn, cotton cloth, securities, fuel, and north-south rice markets. Because the markets were restrained by price controls under the supervision of the military and police, all of them failed to open, and all markets were stagnant. The only standout was the stock market, which, even under the supervision of the military and police, reported another full house of gains shortly after opening. The black market for rice is rampant, and the price of white japonica rice in the suburbs of the city is even higher.

Also: The cotton yarn market was virtually stagnant yesterday. There were no reports of military police gathering to inspect and supervise the market, and two brokers who violated the regulations last Saturday were paraded through the streets, causing panic and making transactions stagnant. The focus was on discussing how to trade in the future, so although the market was open as usual, there were no transactions.

### Rising Prices Not Checked

[Report from this newspaper] According to statistics from the China Economic Research Institute, the wholesale price index in this city from June 28 to July 3 has reached 2,453,000 times that before the war. Prices have risen sharply since the 25th of last month, unprecedentedly. The momentum was still surging on the 28th. Due to the half-year settlement, the market was closed on the 29th. On the 30th and July 1st, various industries needed funds for settlement. At the same time, the living cost index rose sharply, and public and private agencies issued salaries, requiring a large amount of cash. The money market tightened, and prices fell by about 10%. After the market reopened, although the authorities tried their best to suppress the market, the rising trend of prices

The rising trend of prices has become even more rampant recently. According to the Eastern Economic Research Institute, the retail price index of essential daily necessities in this city last week (June 28 to July 3) is as follows:

(1) Food category was 1,458,000 times, an increase of 33.15% from the previous week.

(2) Clothing category was 2,173,000 times, an increase of 39.74% from the previous week.

(3) Fuel category was 1,653,000 times, an increase of 51.51% from the previous week.

(4) Miscellaneous category was 4,057,000 times, an increase of 29.25% from the previous week.

(5) The general index was 2,147,000 times, an increase of 38.15% from the previous week.

In total, the general index for last week has risen to 2,147,000 times, an increase of more than 580,000 times from the previous week. The intensity of the rise is unprecedented. Among the various materials last week, fuel increased the most, due to the lack of coal sources. The rising trend of other items such as food and clothing was not weak either.

### Investor Confidence High, Buying Enthusiasm Strong, Chinese Stocks Reported Another Full House of Gains, Government Bonds Rose Sharply, Foreign Stocks Still Not Open

Chinese stocks continued to report a full house of gains yesterday. Small stocks increased by 5 yuan to more than 10 yuan. Yong Yarn reached a peak of 600 yuan. The bulls were satisfied, and the Guangdong traders also sold. In the end, they struggled with an increase of more than 400 yuan. The excessive surge caused chaos, and knowledgeable people were worried, knowing that a reaction was inevitable.

When the market opened in the morning, investor confidence was still very high. Yong Yarn rose to the limit as soon as it opened, and other stocks also successively announced their limit up. Under the urgent covering of short positions and the influx of new buyers, Nos. 156 and 76 went even further, adding more than 300 yuan. When the agency fee opened high to 374 yuan and 380 yuan, Nos. 60 and 162 and others began to sell, retreating close to the limit. Xinguang Jingfu was adjusted by a large number of spot chips, falling below the limit, and many transactions were made. However, Nos. 107 and 234 and others still gained, and finally had to post a price of about 200 yuan. The remaining stocks were still a full house of gains.

The market continued to be bullish in the afternoon. Yong Yarn once increased to 600 yuan before falling back. Small stocks also generally added 5 yuan to more than 10 yuan. When the market closed, it hovered between 400 yuan and 450 yuan. The unlisted stocks outside the market rose by another half to one percent.

Yongan Textile Factory held its shareholders' meeting yesterday and resolved to pay a dividend of 10 yuan per share (in kind).

Government Bonds

Yesterday the upward momentum was quite strong. United Bonds of C type jumped to 800,000 in the morning and reached a high price of 920,000, then leveled off slightly, closing at around 840,000, with a turnover of 2 to 3 million. Compared with last Saturday, A and B types rose by 140,000 yuan, C type rose by 170,000 yuan, D type rose by 130,000 yuan, and United Bonds of E type also rose by a good 150,000 yuan.

Foreign Stocks

Still not open yesterday.

### Money Market Trended Looser

Yesterday the money market in this city trended looser. In the clearing of bills among the silver houses, the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury had a slight surplus. The total amount was 287.6 billion. The Central Bank had a surplus of 66.6 billion, the Bank of China had a deficit of 39.9 billion, the Bank of Communications had a surplus of 108.5 billion, the Farmers Bank had a surplus of 47.5 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a surplus of 196.8 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had a surplus of 193.4 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a surplus of 73.8 billion, the clearing of commercial banks and firms had a surplus of 15.1 billion, the small clearing had a deficit of 84.36 billion, and the surplus of foreign banks totaled 540.9 billion.

Also: According to the financial community, the reasons for the tight money market are: (1) The amount of speculative capital from the north has decreased. Although the Shanghai foreign exchange has been opened, the amount is not large, and the amount of cash transported to Shanghai has been drastically reduced. (2) Amidst the sharp rise in prices, those with long positions are unwilling to lend. (3) The amount of speculative capital from Hankou and other places coming to Shanghai has also decreased.

### Ninth Meeting of the Discount and Lending Committee, Approved Nine Loan Cases

The National Bank Discount and Lending Committee held its ninth meeting at 11 a.m. on the 5th, presided over by Governor Yu Hongjun, to discuss 11 national policy and business loans. As a result, six national policy loans and three business loans were approved.

### Tea Prices Rise

The tea market continued to advance uniformly yesterday. As a result of the closing, the market generally reported a full house of gains. Because the price of raw tea leaves continues to rise steadily, and because all materials are rising and there are reports of adjustments in freight rates, the asking price finally soared. As for transactions, the trade negotiations were not smooth, so compared with last week, they were relatively inferior.

### Sixth Taiwan Sugar Quotation and Allocation

The Shanghai office of Taiwan Sugar Company will still handle the sixth quotation and allocation of a batch of Taiwan sugar today according to the quotation and allocation method. The sugar is a special grade of granulated white sugar in 200-jin packages. All customers who have been approved for registration can apply for purchase at the office from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. today.

### There is Still No Hope for the Restoration of North Coal South Transportation

Due to traffic obstruction, there is currently no hope for the restoration of north coal south transportation. According to the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee yesterday, except for Kaijie Mine, which has a large number of products every month, the output of other producing areas is extremely small. However, it is temporarily impossible to transport Kailuan coal. Although the Fuel Management Committee has a plan to order coal from the South Pacific coal producing areas and transport it to China for relief, it is difficult to realize because the government does not provide foreign exchange. If this continues, the supply of coal in this city in July is likely to experience a coal shortage. It is deeply hoped that the government will approve the foreign exchange for purchasing coal and engage in overseas procurement of coal.

Also, the Fuel Management Committee previously sent the "Ruixin" ship of China Airlines to Keelung to load coal and transport it to Shanghai for relief. The ship has loaded 8,200 tons of Taiwan coal in Keelung and is scheduled to transport it to Shanghai this morning for supply. Those who need it feel slightly reassured upon hearing this.

### Soap Shortage Increases Prices

In the daily necessities soap market, the going is still active in the direct sales shops, and the supply from factories is scarce. The inventory is insufficient to meet the market demand, and investor confidence is high. The price of Guben soap rose to 900,000 yuan, Arrowhead soap also rose to a good 1.4 million yuan, and Xiangmao and Guanghua soaps are selling very well. The market is bullish and the price is up, surging to 10 million yuan. The price of Guanghua has risen to 25.5 million yuan per box, and other items such as matches and kerosene are also strong.

### Continuously Rising Cigarette Sales

Yesterday's cigarette market saw prices soar due to delayed deliveries from the Yizhong Company and factory price adjustments. Sellers were firm in their intentions, and buyers were eager, leading to a surge in market prices.

Ten-cigarette packs of "Great Britain" brand cigarettes rose to 525 million yuan, a staggering increase of 15 million yuan compared to the weekend. "Old Knife" brand cigarettes also rose by 10 million yuan, and other brands of strip cigarettes were also brisk. However, the market for "Morris Six" and "Chilly Crack" and other canned cigarettes experienced a slight downturn.

### Chaotic Situation Outside Cotton Yarn Market, Sparse Cloth Trading, Inconsistent Prices

Due to the presence of police monitoring the yarn market, there were no formal transactions inside. However, the situation outside was chaotic, and few prices were quoted. It was reported that 42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was quoted slightly higher than the weekend, by 10 to 20 million yuan. The cotton cloth market was stagnant. Ten minutes before the market opened, Dong Jiufeng, Director of the Cloth Industry Association, announced under the order of the Garrison Headquarters that prices could only fall and not rise, but legitimate profits would be protected. He also warned brokers present with three points: (1) All brokers must submit transaction records within two days, otherwise they will be removed from the register; (2) Brokers have an obligation to provide information on who is hoarding, especially those outside the industry; (3) Outside market transactions in the afternoon are strictly prohibited, and violators will face punishments more severe than public shaming. He hoped that all brokers would cooperate with the government's intention to suppress rising prices, awaiting the arrival of US aid materials in four weeks, which would certainly achieve the goal of strongly suppressing rising prices, causing widespread shock and a reluctance to trade.

It wasn't until after 10:30 AM, after earnest persuasion from relevant parties, that trading began to pick up slightly. "Trumpet Boy" fine cloth traded at 224 million, closing at 210 million higher at noon. "Sunshine" fine cloth traded at 211 million, and "Four Gentlemen" serge closed at 248 million yuan, "Bu Xiu" at 70 million yuan. In addition, bleached cloth rose slightly, and "Shilin" cloth and "An An" blue cloth rose again, varying from 1 million to 4.5 million yuan.

Another report stated that "Dragon Head" fine cloth was quoted at 252 million yuan inside the market, retreating to 45 million yuan in actual transactions. There were also a few transactions of "Four Gentlemen" serge, while "Dragon Head" outside the market was quoted at around 255 million yuan.

China Textile Corporation (中紡) Sells Over 900 Yarn Bundles

Another report: Yesterday, the China Textile Corporation (中紡) sold 904 yarn bundles, totaling 61.69 billion. The approved prices were: 6-count "Secondary Sunlight" at 31.2 million, 8-count "Sunlight" at 42 million, 10-count "Wen Li Ma" at 48 million, 10-count "Secondary Blue Phoenix" at 48 million, 16-count "Red Flower Bee" at 56 million, 20-count "Wealthy" at 61.6 million, 20-count "Flying Horse" at 62.5 million, 32-count "Yang Crane" at 73 million, 40-count "Immortal Peach" at 81.5 million, 42-count "Wen" double-strand "Precious Light" at 85.5 million, and 60-count double-strand "Chestnut" at 155 million.

### Wanfengxiang Textile Factory Not Allowed to Relocate to Taiwan

[This newspaper's report] The Ranbo Wanfengxiang Textile Factory previously submitted to the Yarn Management Committee a request to relocate its operations to Taiwan, citing insufficient electricity, high raw material prices, and a shortage of technicians. The committee duly reported the situation to the Ministry, which has now issued an order rejecting the request. Since Taiwan is not a cotton-producing region, operating there would make raw materials even more expensive, and it would be inconsistent with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' policy of promoting the development of the inland textile industry. Therefore, the factory's request was not approved.

### Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Maintains Original Production Quota

[This newspaper's report] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association previously considered reducing production by 20% due to a shortage of raw cotton. It is now understood that this intention has been abandoned, and the original production quota will be maintained. This is because the Yarn Management Committee has repeatedly stated that it will supply raw cotton to the factories, and a large quantity of US aid cotton will also be allocated. At the same time, reducing production would affect the employment of workers, posing significant practical difficulties.

### Rayon Initially Firm, Then Weak

Yesterday's rayon market started high but then fell, ultimately closing about 20 million yuan higher than last Saturday. 120-count "Golden Three Horses" bright rayon traded at a high of 1.39 billion yuan in the morning, with the lowest spot price falling to 1.17 billion yuan. The noon close for Monday delivery was quoted at 1.26 billion yuan. The afternoon opened at 1.3 billion yuan, falling to 1.285 billion and 1.275 billion yuan in actual transactions, closing with buyers willing to pay 1.26 billion yuan and sellers asking 1.28 billion yuan.

Factory Direct Sales

Yesterday's market was buoyant, but there were no transactions for five-dan lots of any grade. "C" grade was quoted near 1.5 billion yuan. There were more than ten bundles of smaller lots traded yesterday. Morning spot prices for smaller lots reached 1.35 billion yuan, with two- to three-day term prices reaching 1.4 billion yuan in the afternoon. Quotes for "Thousand Classics" yarn also saw an increase yesterday.

Silk Fabrics

Yesterday's market was under government surveillance, and formal transactions were scarce. The afternoon price of real silk quilt covers was around 630 million yuan, checkered crepe was within the 2.3 million yuan range, ordinary "Hua Jin" crepe was quoted at 1 million yuan, and trading for other fabrics was also very quiet.

### Prices in Production Areas Rising Steadily, Rice Retail Prices Increase, White Japonica and Thin Indica Rice at 22 Million Yuan

The rice market remained suspended. Police and military continued to strictly inspect the markets. Due to rising prices in production areas and no price reductions, sellers had no intention to sell due to cost considerations. About 400 piculs of Jiangxi Indica rice that had spoiled in storage were sold in the market at prices such as 15.6 million. Retail prices increased, with white Japonica and thin Indica rice at 22 million yuan, early Indica rice at 21.5 million yuan. Rice prices in the suburbs opened with medium-grade white Japonica and thin Indica at 20 million yuan, and white Yuan rice at 23 million yuan.

Flour

Because of high wheat prices and rising inland prices, it was still impossible to trade at the restricted price, and the market remained suspended. "Battleship" brand flour was sold at 6 million yuan retail, and wheat factory prices opened at 7.5 million yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 700,000 yuan.

Grains

Initially, there were no transactions, but after the association announced the transaction price of June 26 (the price restricted by the authorities), a few token transactions began to appear. "Zha" beans were allocated at 8.5 million yuan, "Mao Lu" mung beans at 10 million yuan, and raw peanuts and sesame seeds also saw slightly more activity.

Cooking Oil

There were still no transactions, and manufacturers were not supplying. Yesterday, all the cloth markets completed the registration of their inventory. Since the storage slips required goods to be delivered within a specified period, oil factories have been very busy with deliveries recently. There were no transactions for soybean cake, and the asking price outside the market was 4.9 million yuan.

Order Requiring Registration of Rice Stocks in Warehouses

[Another report] It is understood that the stalemate in the rice market is expected to be resolved after Mayor Wu returns to Shanghai from Nanjing for instructions. The municipal authorities have ordered all warehouses to register their stocks with the Social Affairs Bureau by today. Yesterday morning, the rice market issued an urgent notice, requiring all rice merchants to complete the registration of all warehouse stocks before 5 PM yesterday, so that they could be compiled and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau. The Grain Association is also required to register inventory by 12 noon today, and failure to report by the deadline will result in severe punishment by the authorities.

### Imported Oils and Refined Products Can Be Freely Transported and Sold

The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance previously levied mineral production tax on kerosene and other mineral oils in this city, in accordance with an order from the Tax Administration. Subsequently, the city's Oil Commercial Association argued that all mineral oils in this city were imported and did not meet the requirements of the mineral production tax regulations.

After the Tax Bureau reported to the Tax Administration, it was approved that kerosene, lubricating oil, spindle oil, and other oils refined from imported diesel oil were exempt from mineral production tax. The Bureau was also instructed that filling out yellow customs declarations at the time of import and export of these oils was also waived, to facilitate trade. Subsequently, refined products from these imported oils can be freely transported and sold without having to go through the Tax Bureau's inspection and endorsement procedures for customs declarations.

### The Validity Period of Exchange Settlement Certificates Extended to 30 Days by National Bank Notice

[This newspaper's report] The validity period of exchange settlement certificates was originally stipulated by the National Bank as seven days, after which they would be invalid. Recently, the Business Bureau of the National Bank issued Circular No. 145 to all designated banks, extending the validity period of exchange settlement certificates to thirty days, calculated from the date of issuance, excluding Sundays and holidays. However, if the expiration date of the exchange settlement certificate falls on a holiday, its validity period can be extended by one day. As for the exchange settlement certificates issued in other cities and telegraphed to Shanghai for sale, they will continue to be handled according to the previous regulations, that is, regardless of how many days remain on their original validity period, as long as they arrive in Shanghai within the validity period, the National Bank can issue a special exchange settlement certificate valid for seven days.

In addition, ordinary and special exchange settlement certificates issued before Circular No. 145 was issued, if they have not been canceled due to import licenses or for other reasons, will have their validity period extended to thirty days, calculated from the original date of issuance.

### Difficulties in Calculating the Price for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises

The government previously ordered the Central Bank to form a banking syndicate to sell state-owned enterprises. The Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank has been ordered to comply and has invited the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to assist in the process. The Bank of China will be responsible for the sale of the China Textile Corporation (中紡), the Bank of Communications will handle the sale of the China Merchants Group (招商局), and the Central Bank will be in a supervisory position. Each institution has valued the enterprises in US dollars, estimating a total value of over 500 million US dollars. After the banking syndicate is established, it will re-evaluate the enterprises. However, the shares will be issued in US dollars, but there has been no decision on whether the US dollar exchange rate will be based on the black market rate or the exchange settlement certificate rate.

### Silk Sales in the US Market Picking Up

According to related sources, actual sales of raw silk in the US market have recently shown signs of improvement, because the weaving industries are all using raw silk for weaving. However, prices remain stable and have not exceeded the original set price. As for the export of silk fabrics, conditions in India, Southeast Asia, and other regions have also gradually improved recently. Last year's shipment of 100,000 bolts of fabric to India did not meet the needs of the region, so although there were frequent transactions, actual sales were not smooth.

### China Trust Bureau Transports and Sells Over Two Million Bags of Flour in Tianjin

In order to suppress prices in North China, the financial authorities have rushed to transport 2.45 million bags of flour to Tianjin, where they will continue to sell large quantities of flour. This flour was purchased by the National Bank previously, and it is now being transported to Tianjin by the China Trust Bureau.

### Commercial Situation in Various Regions

The former president, He Xiaozhang, has gone to Nanjing again and will return to Shanghai to hand over responsibilities after Li decides on the date of his arrival. Zhao Shoukang, Zhao Zengyue, and Professor Zhou Ming, members of the alumni association, visited Li the other day to urge him to take office as soon as possible, but Li expressed that he still needed to consider it. The Ministry of Education is also quite hesitant about this matter. The date for the university's graduation ceremony has yet to be determined after the new president arrives.

Because of this connection, the expenses of the councils at all levels should be included in the provincial and municipal governments and the county and city governments' education and culture funds. The council has instructed the provincial, municipal, and county councils to submit their budgets and send them to the local education authorities for inclusion in the local government budgets. On the 5th, the Ministry of Education instructed the provincial and municipal education bureaus to forward the instructions to the county and city education bureaus for compliance.

### National Finances are Difficult, No Increase in National Universities Allowed, Daxia's Request to Become Nationalized Not Approved, Education Minister Zhu's Reply Explains the Reasons

[This newspaper's report] Daxia University students requested to become nationalized. The university has reported the matter to the board of trustees, and Chairman Sun Ke has sent a letter to Education Minister Zhu. It has been learned that Minister Zhu has replied to Chairman Sun Ke, stating that there are many practical difficulties in the request to become nationalized. The letter stated: "I received your letter of the 25th of this month. Regarding your request to convert the private Daxia University into a national university, I respectfully submit the following: (1) Due to the difficult national finances, the Ministry has been instructed by the Executive Yuan not to increase the number of national universities. Even if we were to submit a request to the Executive Yuan at this time, it would certainly not be approved. (2) Private schools have their own characteristics and should be supported to allow them to develop freely. (3) There are many private schools. If one school is allowed to be converted into a national university, then all schools will follow suit, as was the case with the subsequent request by Guanghua University. (4) The public funding system has been abolished. Students' financial difficulties cannot be solved by converting to a national university. The above are all practical difficulties. I hope you will understand."

### Rectifying School Discipline, Stabilizing Studies, Daxia University Expels 56 Students

[This newspaper's report] The private Daxia University in this city announced yesterday the expulsion of 56 students, including Ding Shilan. The announcement stated: "In late June, a group of students fabricated rumors, using the pretext of requesting to become nationalized to instigate student unrest, coerce teachers, tear down notices, resist examinations, obstruct the payment of fees, and even destroy school property and forcibly seize cash. Such actions have completely undermined school discipline. The school treats students like children and has repeatedly given earnest advice, hoping they would realize their mistakes, but they have coerced the masses and intensified their actions, going against the tide and acting arbitrarily. The majority of good students have been deeply intimidated and unable to participate in examinations to complete their studies this semester, which is particularly distressing. In order to rectify school discipline and stabilize students' studies, the 19th University Affairs Meeting resolved to expel all students who seriously disrupted school order."

### Our World Games Soccer Team Defeats Overseas Chinese-Malay Allied Team Two to Zero: Maintained Control Throughout

[United Press, Singapore, 4th] The Chinese World Games soccer team played its second-to-last match here today, defeating the Singapore Overseas Chinese and Malay Allied Team two to zero. The visiting team won easily. Although they only scored two goals, they maintained control throughout, and the opponent often adopted a defensive posture. Before the match, the Overseas Chinese-Malay Allied Team was considered one of the strongest teams here. This time, they were fortunate to have a few excellent players, avoiding a major defeat. Halidz, the captain of the Overseas Chinese-Malay Allied Team, made a great effort, but the Chinese team was completely dominant during the game. The forwards ran quickly, and Guo Yingqi and Zou Wenzhi were particularly active. The defense was also solid, responding calmly to the enemy team's sporadic breakaways. Five minutes after the start of the game, the Overseas Chinese-Malay team's right inside forward lost possession, and Guo Yingqi of the Chinese team scored with a ground shot, giving them a 1-0 lead in the first half. In the second half, He Yingfen passed the ball to Zou Wenzhi, and Zou Wenzhi scored with a header, making the final score 2-0.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 4th] Our country's World Games soccer team competed this afternoon with the local Overseas Chinese and Malay Allied Team and won with a score of 2-0. The audience felt that our World Games team's performance today was worse than ever before. It is heard that the team is scheduled to play another match against the Singapore Non-Military Allied Team on the 7th. When the World Games team arrived in Singapore in early May this year, it lost its first match to the Non-Military Allied Team.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 5th] Our country's soccer team attending the World Games will play another match with the local team here before heading to India.

### Field Wet After Rain, Gasoline Burned on the Runway, Red Socks Played Two Games in One Day, Won Against All-Star Allied Army, Last Game Today Against Allied Army Again

[This newspaper's report] The Philippine baseball champion Red Socks team played two consecutive games yesterday, defeating the All-Stars and Allied Army with scores of 9-1 and 2-1 respectively. Today's final game will be a rematch against the Allied Army at the Racecourse at 3 PM. After the game, they will travel to Japan and then return to the Philippines via Guam, ending this [tour].

Yesterday morning, the ground at the Racecourse Plaza had not completely dried. Because the visiting team was leaving Shanghai soon and the Allied Army was insistent on playing another game, the game against the All-Stars had to be moved forward. The US military temporarily poured gasoline on the runway to burn and evaporate the water in the soil. The game reluctantly started at 10:45 AM. The Red Socks continued their overwhelming performance, scoring frequently. The All-Stars only managed to score one point thanks to McLish's home run in the sixth inning. The final score was 9-1.

The afternoon game was because the players of the Allied Army were all related and had a tacit understanding. Moreover, the field was hotter. The Philippine team, having already played a game in the morning, was gradually showing signs of fatigue, and their power was greatly reduced. They struggled for five innings to open the scoring. In the last inning, the Allied Army almost tied the game. The game score was:

Inning | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | Total
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Red Socks | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2
Allied Army | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1

### World Games Basketball Team Leaves Hong Kong for Singapore Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th] Our World Games basketball delegation competed with the Hong Kong Allied Team in a demonstration match at the South China Athletic Federation field here yesterday. Our delegation managed to defeat the strong enemy by a margin of only seven points at the end of the game. For the first 20 minutes, they were under threat from the opponent. At the end of the first half, the World Games team led by a narrow margin of 33-26. By the end of the third quarter, the Hong Kong team had narrowed the gap to just one point. The World Games team scored three consecutive goals in the last three minutes of the game, sealing the victory. The final score was 56-49, with the Hong Kong team being defeated.

### Nationwide Tennis Association Actively Being Organized

Hao Gengsheng, the supervisor of the Ministry of Education and also the secretary-general of the Chinese National Sports Association, after returning to Shanghai from his inspection in Nanyang, had informal contacts with the tennis community in this city to organize a nationwide tennis organization. Due to the enthusiastic support of the tennis community in this city, concrete measures have been beautifully devised. Subsequently, Mr. Hao returned to Beijing, on one hand reporting to the Ministry about his trip to the South Seas, and on the other hand officially taking over the post of secretary-general of the National Sports Association. He will come to Shanghai again today to further discuss the national tennis administrative organization. Because Mr. Hao has scheduled this Thursday to go to Taiwan to address the issue of the location for the next National Games, it is possible that a decisive plan for the national tennis administrative organization will be agreed upon tomorrow (Wednesday).

### First Division Tennis League: Jinlan Wins Over Zhonghua With a Clean Sweep

### Scarcity of World-Class Tennis Talent: This Year's Wimbledon Championships See a Decline in Men's Singles Quality, Lamenting the Difficulty in Finding Talent; Daughters of the Golden State Dominate All Women's Events

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Although tennis has developed into one of the most attractive sports for spectators today, what still disheartens tennis enthusiasts in various countries is that the World Games have not yet included tennis as a competition event. Therefore, the annual Wimbledon Championships held in London have become a de facto unofficial world championship, serving as a high goal for amateur players and a solid stepping stone for professional stars.

The Wimbledon Championships began in 1877, initially with only men's singles. Two years later, men's doubles were added, and five years after that, women's events were included. It was not until 1922, when women's doubles and mixed doubles were established, that the event reached its full scale. Wimbledon has now had 62 editions—with the championships being suspended for nine years due to the two World Wars.

This year's championships are the third after the war, with 128 players from 30 countries competing. Veteran Parker, who came from "McEnroe" (ball boy) background, was selected as the first seed, fully demonstrating the sense of a talent drought in the amateur tennis world after the likes of Kramer, Pails, and Betra went professional. Wimbledon this year has once again entered a periodic low tide, with the overall level showing a decline. The full list of seeded players is: (1) Parker (USA), (2) Bromwich (Australia), (3) Mulloy (USA), (4) Tom Brown (USA), (5) Drobny (Czech Republic), (6) Sturgess (South Africa), (7) Fancutt (Chile), (8) Patty (USA).

On the second day of the championships, a shocking upset occurred. Drobny, the fifth seed with high hopes of winning the title, was defeated 2-3 by the unknown Italian player Cexiri. Following that, Parker was eliminated by the unseeded Swedish player Bergelin in the fourth round. Bergelin, along with Asbóth, who defeated Sturgess, and the other five seeds, reached the quarter-finals. In the quarter-finals, Fancutt and Mulloy defeated Bergelin and Mulloy respectively with scores of 2-1, Bromwich easily defeated Patty in straight sets, and Asbóth of Hungary once again displayed his prowess, repeating his feat from the fourth round after five sets, eliminating another seed, Tom Brown.

The semi-finals were held on June 30th. Bromwich's victory over Asbóth was not unexpected, but Mulloy's defeat by Fancutt in straight sets without any resistance was unforeseen. In the final, Bromwich, the second seed who was considered to have few rivals after Kramer went professional, was defeated by Fancutt after twice leveling the score. Thus, the crown of world tennis fell into the hands of Fancutt.

Women's singles has always been the world of daughters of the Golden State. Before the war, there was Helen Wills Moody, who won eight titles, and Mabel, who leapt from Wimbledon to Hollywood. After the war, there were Pauline Betz, Osborne duPont, and Gussie Moran who successively rose to prominence. After the war, the American heroines of Wimbledon did not allow others to even touch the semi-finals.

In women's singles, the American seeded players sailed smoothly, monopolizing the final four spots. In the semi-finals, Betz eliminated Mrs. duPont with a score of 2-0. As for Miss Osborne, the top seed, her skills have gradually declined since her marriage to Mr. duPont. Gussie Moran, after years of hard work, finally avenged her defeat in the previous year's final with a score of 2-1. This situation is reminiscent of Helen Wills losing the 1931 title due to her honeymoon.

Miss Betz's skills can be compared to those of the world's top female tennis player of many years ago, but Betz's luck is even better. In the women's singles final, she defeated Gussie Moran 6-3, 8-6, winning the title of tennis queen. In women's doubles, she partnered with Mrs. duPont to relive the dream of winning the championship the year before. In mixed doubles, she partnered with Bromwich to continue their efforts, retaining the crown and sweeping the three women's championships, a feat only achieved by Helen Wills Moody before.

### Remembering Mr. San Yuan Again

— Chen Yixian

Reading Ye Xiaweng's poem mourning Mr. San Yuan in Free Talk, I learned that Mr. San Yuan passed away twelve years ago, and there are still people in the world who remember him. Therefore, I am writing this article again.

My elder brother Cangqiu has a poem for sending off Mr. San Yuan's coffin at the North Railway Station, which is recorded below.

"After years of dreaming of the Xie Street Temple, today he rests peacefully on the Mountain. Parting with a coffin on a different path, returning bones in perilous times is like returning to life. Fortunately, there are still sons like Zongwu, (Du Fu died in Leiyang, Zongwu drifted away, and it was not until his grandson Suye that he moved the burial.) How many weak generations are there to send him off in Shanyang, (In Shanyang, only old friends remain, a line from Yu Zishan.) I have a thousand sorrows and one tear left, when will I ever be able to pay my respects again in the pine courtyard?"

The sick tree has a response, also recorded below:

"Remembering the visit to Changchun Temple in Xuan South, the journey is long and heavy, the mountains connecting the house. Across generations, there is finally a memorial service in the ancestral hall, and in the interval, one can truly see a coffin returning. The tears of the slight spring are exhausted, and the debt of grace is long borne. The heart is set on building a house, but the strength is already weak. If you are willing to repay the wild sacrifice at the post pavilion, there is no time to climb over the carriage."

I met Yantong a few days ago and learned that Mr. San Yuan was buried on a certain day last month at Huangni Ridge in Nanshan, Hangzhou. From then on, a generation of poets will be buried in the green mountains, only for people to mourn. It is also known that Mr. San Yuan's manuscripts have been introduced by Li Bake and Chen Shutong to the Zhonghua Book Company for printing. Yanhe and his brothers have signed a contract with Shu Xincheng, a representative of Zhonghua, and it is expected to be published in about a year. This is a happy event. Brother Yanhe has returned to the Nanchang Postal Remittance Bureau, Brother Yantong has returned to Nanjing, and Brother Dengge has returned to Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain. Minister Yu Dawei also went to Hangzhou for the burial.

Among the Four Young Masters of the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. San Yuan and Tan Sitong are the most well-known. (The other two are Wu Yanfu and Ding Huikang, whose style name is Shuya, who is good at playing the qin. Forty years ago, when I was studying at the Translation School in Beijing, I once went to his residence with Liu Pusheng to listen to the qin.) Today, many people are shocked by Mr. San Yuan's fame as a poet, but few know that he was engaged in political reform movements in his prime. The facts will be described in another article in the future. In fact, Mr. Yuan's enthusiasm for worrying about the times and loving the country, and his views on politics, can also be seen in his poems. I love to read his poems from the decade or so after the Wuxu Reform to before the Xinhai Revolution, because at that time the reform movement had failed, and his respected father, the Right Minister Youming, had passed away (the minister and Mr. Yuan were father and son and also comrades, and were dismissed from their posts for advocating reforms). Grief and indignation were expressed in his poems, thus achieving the most excellent realm in his literary life. For example, "Writing My Feelings After Being Drunk on New Year's Eve" says: "The thirtieth day of the year has passed, and children and ducks are noisy. The high candle illuminates the mat with mixed dishes and cakes, and I am drunk and abruptly give a long sigh. I know one or two things about national affairs, what evening is tonight to be able to reminisce? The bandits in the southwest have been around for several years, emerging and ravaging arrogantly. The east reaches the Yellow Sea and the northern ridge is slight, the dragons and whales fight and the jackals and tigers rush. The outcome has not yet been decided between the two sides, and the counties where they originated are frequently slaughtered. The islanders and barbarians increasingly harass us, and yin and yang open and close in discord. How can the current situation not be understood? Why do the remaining breaths live together like corpses? Since five years ago, it has been called the reform, but it has been hasty and plundered with fraud. Both inside and outside are holding on to the old stories, and morning and evening three or four Shao Zhongju. Letting artemisia be used as a pillar is already enough, why use a stiff peach tree instead of a plum tree! Why are the main principles and important items all omitted? Limiting power and establishing a constitution are for ridicule. What's more, the tired and disabled block the pivot, and the stuttering and whispering have other hills. Cutting flesh to mend sores is beneficial to the eyebrows and eyelashes, and the whole country is turned upside down from amusement. Bribery is openly accepted in broad daylight, and what Han Yu was angry about is still trivial. If we were to be treated like Ren Ang, the descendants of the gods would be completely destroyed. I deeply think of Yu's shackles for tens of thousands of miles, and I have thrown my life to line the whip drive for a long time. The rise of many theories has a reason, and I want to sweep away the differences and return to the Yi Tu. The scholars and people cover their faces and come out with great pain, and local autonomy is the model in front. If there is no effect in an emergency, this meaning will eventually be revealed to open the minds of the masses. Throughout the year, the chest is filled with lumps, and if I don't spit it out today, I am not a man. Listeners, don't laugh at my drunken words, the droplets of tears and blood stain my clothes."

This poem was written in the thirtieth year of Guangxu, before the Republic of China. Placed today, it can still be used as a photo. Reading it makes people feel sad and indignant, unable to control themselves. From this, we know that the reason why poets are poets is that there is something immortal in them, and the fact that they are concerned about the country and hold grudges in the Nine Springs is the same encounter for all poets throughout the ages.

### Precious Snuff Bottles

— He Dao

In the eighteenth century, Europeans liked to make snuff bottles with extremely exquisite grains. I remember that Zhao Shuru also wrote a small book specializing in Western snuff bottles. Most of those snuff bottles were pure gold, inlaid with jewels. When the lid was opened, the mechanism would be triggered, and a slight, pleasant music would be emitted. The characters carved on the bottles could even move. There is still someone collecting a snuff bottle with six firefighters carved on it, busily taking leather straps to put out a fire in a house. Three people in the upper floor of the house were rushing from window to window, trying to escape—everyone could move.

### Literary Inspiration

— Jin Lin

The humorous novelist Lytton Strachey, when his literary inspiration was blocked, would go to the beach. In the sea foam, he obtained the inspiration that he could not easily grasp on weekdays.

Stevenson often gained inspiration in his dreams and wrote many novels, which sold very well. The famous "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" was written from the inspiration he gained in a dream.

The famous American playwright Eugene O'Neill once admitted that the plots of many of his plays also came from dreams.

Compton Mackenzie wanted to find a deserted island to write his book. A few years ago, he rented a small island, and then changed another one, pursuing the solitude that promoted literary inspiration.

When George Bernard Shaw was sweeping his pen in his study, he felt that his literary inspiration was insufficient. He once said to someone that he had written many plays from ideas he had while sitting on the upper level of a bus or in a train. When an idea appeared, he immediately wrote it down in shorthand.

The novelist Hardy admitted that he could not write anything while wearing shoes. The poet Longfellow declared that he wrote at sunrise and sunset. H.G. Wells wrote many great works while riding in a balloon.

Tobacco promotes literary inspiration. James Barrie once said that a pipe of tobacco equals an idea, and six ideas make a plot.

### Eccentricities of Celebrities

— Jin Lin

The great American painter Whistler was cynical throughout his life, and his clothing was often the opposite of what others wore. For example, the evening dress for dancing is the most particular for Westerners, but he did not wear a bow tie—instead, he wore a red flower on his black leather shoes.

Leonardo da Vinci was the most famous painter of the European Renaissance. He was Italian and not only good at painting, but also good at sports, and sometimes he also studied science, but when he wrote, he wrote from right to left.

### Rickshaws in Tianjin and Beijing

— Chen Yanfan

In Shanghai, you can easily encounter or see such things:

You are waiting for a tram at a tram stop, at night, or in the rain. The tram has not come, or it is very crowded. So you try to call a rickshaw. "Rickshaw, ×× Road!" The rickshaw comes, and in this case, a not very near road will now cost you 200,000 or 250,000, still with a very calm air.

So you offer him an 80% discount. He doesn't turn his head back, or he turns his head back and glares at you, and then he straddles the car and leaves.

Sometimes the rickshaw driver thinks the place you want to go is too far, ignores you, and leaves. Sometimes, his car is going west, and the place you are going is east, so he refuses to obey. And sometimes, when you promise him 200,000 yuan from a certain road to ×× bridge, although you have not yet reached your destination, he thinks that since he has reached ×× bridge, he should not be called to walk a little more, so he stops, indicating that his labor has already ended here for the price of 200,000 yuan.

The rickshaw drivers' arrogance is very high. In Shanghai, I know that I have to be careful not to think about the place beyond a certain bridge, but only say to the bottom of the bridge. If you don't prepare to "tip" the expensive fare on a rainy day, you should take another car instead.

Having experienced the arrogance of Shanghai rickshaw drivers, it is really different when you get to Tianjin and Beijing. The rickshaws in Tianjin and Beijing let you jump on any one you want, point a direction, and go wherever you want to go. When you get down, you ask him: "How much is it?" He politely says: "Sir, you can give what you think is appropriate." If the fare you give him exceeds his estimated standard by 20,000 or 30,000, he will definitely say again and again: "Thank you, thank you."

The rickshaw drivers in Tianjin and Beijing never try to rip you off, and the price is usually about one-third lower than in Shanghai, although the price of food in Tianjin and Beijing is much more expensive than in Shanghai. When the price of the staple food corn in the north reaches 120,000 yuan per catty, the life of the rickshaw drivers in Tianjin and Beijing is almost tragic. It is said that their daily income is now about 700,000 or 800,000, excluding 150,000 for car rental, and sometimes they have to repair the car. If a family has three people, it is still very difficult to buy corn to fill their stomachs. But they are disciplined and never mess around. The rickshaw drivers in Tianjin and Beijing never ignore you. If they want to go home, they will politely tell the person calling the car. If you tell him a certain road and have not found your destination after stepping over one or two streets, he will not complain to you, mutter in his mouth, or even stop and argue with you.

The flat and wide roads in Tianjin and Beijing, and the fact that there are fewer people and cars on the street, also make rickshaw passengers feel comfortable. The streets near the Forbidden City at the Qianmen Gate in Beijing, and several streets in the former British and French concessions in Tianjin, are flat and spacious, and the rickshaws are speeding along effortlessly, which cannot be compared with walking half a street in an hour in the central district of Shanghai.

### Shi Nai'an and the Surname Zhang

— Songpu

Shi Nai'an's "Water Margin" is extremely widely circulated in our country, enough to be compared with the Four Books of our country and the Bible of the West. To put it in a colloquialism, it is: "Wherever there is water, there is it."

In this magnificent 70-chapter masterpiece, there is a very interesting thing: when falsely claiming a name, many say the surname is "Zhang". For example, when Song Jiang was afraid of being arrested and fled incognito, when people asked his surname, he would reply: "I am Zhang"; when Wu Yong took Li Kui and Lu Junyi to Liangshan, he also told people that Li Kui was "Zhang Heizi"; when Dai Zong took Li Kui to the mountain to find Gongsun Sheng, Gongsun's old mother asked what Li Kui's surname was, and Dai Zong replied: "This person's surname is Zhang"; such examples are endless. In short, when shirking a false surname, it is said in the Water Margin that the surname is "Zhang".

I don't know if this is a random thing, or if it was done on purpose? If you say it was done "accidentally", it doesn't make sense that there would be so many people with the false surname "Zhang" in such a large novel; if you say it was done "on purpose", then Shi Nai'an must have a close relationship with the surname Zhang: either relatives or enemies; otherwise, he would never be so unforgettable about the surname "Zhang".

### The Iron Qin and Bronze Sword Building

— Qian Dacheng

Long days are boring, sorting out the remaining books, I suddenly got a rubbing of the epitaph of Mr. Qu Liangshi, the owner of the Tieqin Tongjian Lou, which was given by Mr. Fengqi. Yan Gu the Elder wrote the text, Xiao Tuwen engraved the cover, and Jiang Zuoma wrote the inscription. They are all excellent choices for a time! In fact, this article was drafted by Yang Wuyang, and Yan Gu the Elder only revised it and wrote the inscription. Qu's family, since his great-grandfather Shaoji, liked to collect books. The Song and Yuan good editions from Shiliju Art Yun Jingshe were scattered, and Qu's family collected most of them, so he built Tianyu Zhai to store them, and Huang Qinliu wrote a record for it; it was the year Gengzi in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. Since he avoided the Qing Emperor Dezong's examination, he changed his name to Tieqin Tongjian Lou. Qu's descendants all liked to collect books. Through repeated changes and chaos, the couplets were all preserved. In the late Qing Dynasty, when Duanfang opened the government in Liangjiang, he planned to take it back to the state-owned, and it was heard that Mr. Zeng Mengpu strongly advocated this proposal; Bao Liangshi was in Beijing, and Liangshi did not move. Ye Juchang copied a hundred kinds of books to present, and the matter was subsided. Juchang's "Ludu Lu Diary" records the matter to the point of fraud, which can be reviewed. In fact, if the collection of the Qian Tang Ding family Shanben Room is all state-owned, it is ultimately easier to preserve than private homes. The Qu family's collection, of which quite a few have been printed in the Four Series, has greatly benefited the scholars. During the chaos of Ding Chou, the Song and Yuan good editions were stored at sea, fortunately without any loss. However, the Ming editions and the writings of Changshu people were all looted by the soldiers. Mr. Liangshi also died in Shanghai. His youngest son, Mr. Fengqi, was proficient in the study of editions, but the world was in chaos like hemp, and it was not easy to protect the couplets! Liangshi's name was Qijia, a native of Changshu, and he once served as a member of the National Assembly. When Cao Kun bribed the presidential election, Mr. returned to the south, and then did not come out. However, he protected and borrowed the local literature of his hometown, and published a record of the writings of the villagers and stored them in the county libraries. Ye Juchang spoke the most about the anecdotes of his family's collection. Huang Wencun Jisongyun compiled the book catalog. Since the Qing Dynasty, there have been dozens of famous book collectors in Yushan, but they have all been washed away by the wind and clouds. Recently, such as Zhao's Tianfang Lou Jiushan Lou, Ding's Chuyuan, and other chaos, are all scattered. As for Shen's Shimizhai Xiren Qi, the descendants have different preferences, and they are all ten or five. If the Qu family can pass on for five generations, and become more prominent in the future, and become a great book collector in the world, it is rare in ancient and modern times.

Although "not eating" is impossible to live, "eating less" is not impossible. People do need to eat, but the "quantity" of what they take in, and the suitable "quality", vary according to their endowment and their usual lifestyle. This is not lacking in previous examples, and it is not unexpected to observe the facts. Liang Lulin's (Zhong Gongzhi's former residence) Gui Tian Suo Ji quotes Ying Qu's poem to say that the reason why Zhong Sou lived to a long age was, "Measure the stomach daily, and reduce what is received." Bo Wu Zhi says, "The less you eat, the more open your mind is, and the longer you live; the more you eat, the more blocked your mind is, and the more you lose years." This is the principle. As for the facts, it is said, "When I was in Beijing, I served Mr. Dai Keting to ask for advice on the art of curing diseases and prolonging life. The teacher himself said that when he was supervising education in Sichuan, he suffered from a disease similar to weakness, and someone recommended a Taoist priest from Mount Emei to treat him. He sat opposite each other for five days and taught him the method of breathing, and he recovered from fatigue. Now, decades later, he is stronger than before. He gets up early every day and only eats a large bowl of fine porridge, and at noon he eats a cup of human milk. He asked, 'Is this already full?' The teacher said loudly, 'Do people have to eat until they are full'?" This is the difference in "quantity". Liang also recorded his teacher Ji Wenda (Yun) saying, "Ba Gongping never eats grain in his life. He eats noodles occasionally, but he has never tasted rice. He only eats a plate of pork and a pot of tea at mealtime. His banquets are also clean and elegant, and the host only raises his chopsticks." This is the difference in "quality". These are not common examples in life, but they can all become special examples. (If Ji Wenda was born in modern times, he would not be afraid of the price of rice and noodles rising to the sky, because he does not eat grain at all, and only looks for meat shops.)

Dai Keting served as a Hanlin official until he became a minister of state. In his later years, he retired and enjoyed his leisure. He lived to be ninety-five years old. His lifelong learning was profound and intoxicating, and his situation was smooth and comfortable. He was not tempted by things and did not do anything that would harm life, so eating less was beneficial and he was able to live a long life. However, the method of guiding and breathing taught by the Taoist priest of Mount Emei that he described is different from the ancient myths of avoiding grains and becoming immortals, and it should be noted by those who experiment with hygiene. It is not reasonable to say that relying on this technique means that you don't need food rations, but it is not unfounded to save food rations and eliminate the burden of eating. Now Yang Mei is from Sichuan, maybe the method of the Taoist priest of Mount Emei has descendants? In short, special examples are possible, but common examples are impossible; eating less is believable, but not eating is unbelievable. And in the "eating less" and "not eating" of special examples, the distance is very small. Dai Keting's one bowl of porridge every morning and one cup of milk every night is almost not eating when compared to the minimum amount of ordinary people, let alone nine years! Therefore, it is not necessary to treat Yang's girl as too mysterious, even if major scientists examine her personally, it cannot be popularized to the masses and solve the problem of rice and noodles for the public.
