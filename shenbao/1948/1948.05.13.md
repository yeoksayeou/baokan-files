### Over 30 Million US Dollars Worth of Materials Continuously Shipped to China in Six Weeks, Including Rice, Cotton, Gasoline, and Fertilizer

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The US aid to China program has officially begun today. The US Economic Cooperation Administration has approved US$36.5 million for the import of materials to China and will conduct preliminary investigations into possible reconstruction programs. The above funds will be used within the next six weeks, during which the following important materials will be continuously shipped to China: US$13.5 million for rice, US$13 million for cotton, US$8 million for gasoline, US$1.5 million for fertilizer, and US$500,000 for US personnel to investigate reconstruction programs. These personnel will first send Mr. Lapham's representative to China, but the departure date has not yet been announced. Economic Cooperation Administrator Hoffman announced that of the US$50 million advanced by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, US$36.5 million has been approved for use. He stated that the materials currently being shipped to China are all donations. Mr. Lapham stated that the materials for the initial aid to China program are all necessities that will benefit the livelihood and economic stability of the Chinese people. The approved funds will be used to repay the Chinese government for the price of cotton, gasoline, and fertilizer obtained from the United States on April 3rd of this year. In addition, US$13.5 million will be used to purchase rice in May and June, which can purchase 18,000 metric tons of American wheat or flour and 57,000 metric tons of Siamese rice. The funds for purchasing cotton can purchase approximately 66,000 bales of cotton. It is revealed that according to the plan, China will obtain gasoline from the Persian Gulf region to save on transportation costs. Economic Cooperation Administration officials also stated that the International Emergency Food Committee had previously recommended allocating nitrogen fertilizer to China, but this was shelved due to the country's lack of foreign exchange. The Economic Cooperation Administration also stated that, with the exception of rice, the purchase of the above-mentioned aid materials to China in the initial plan will be conducted through private trading organizations.

[US Information Service, Washington, 11th] Economic Cooperation Administrator Hoffman announced that, according to the Aid to China Act, China has been authorized to receive US$338 million in economic assistance within one year, to be handled by the Economic Cooperation Administration. In addition, another US$125 million will be provided as additional assistance.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The US Department of Agriculture recently announced that of the total 833,600 long tons of grain exported, 9,300 tons of wheat will be exported to China in June.

The Department of Agriculture and Forestry stated that 111,000 long tons of wheat and flour, including the quantity announced today, are scheduled to be shipped to China between July 1947 and June 1948.

### New Developments Brewing in US-Soviet Relations, Our Government Closely Monitoring, Adopting a Reserved Attitude to Observe Future Developments

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Mr. Sun Ke met with reporters on the 12th and commented on the direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, saying that direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union are a good thing, but we should not overestimate them, as there may not be good results in the future. There are too many fundamental conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union. For example, the US aid to 16 Western European countries is to help them recover and promote peace in Europe, but the Soviet Union has consistently attacked this attitude of the United States, believing that the United States has aggressive intentions. Mr. Sun then quoted the content of Mr. Smith's speech, saying that if the Soviet Union does not provide assistance to Eastern European countries, the United States will not take action in Western Europe. For example, US aid to China is also done with our prior consent, which is enough to prove that US aid to Western Europe is actually to help them recover and has no other intentions, but the Soviet Union ignores this. Based on this, the prospects for US-Soviet negotiations are not optimistic.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Shao Lizi, our former ambassador to the Soviet Union, told reporters on the 12th about the direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, saying that the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union will determine world peace. However, the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union must be sincere, because the atmosphere of war has actually descended upon us. If the United States and the Soviet Union conduct negotiations, then those who are overly advocating war will have a good clarification. Secondly, Shao believes that the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union will also have indirect relations with our country. If the negotiations are successful, world peace can be established, and our country's problems can be transformed. Moreover, if this negotiation is successful in Europe, it will inevitably extend to negotiations in Asia.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] When answering questions at the press conference of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan on the 12th, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson and Director of the Information Department Shi Zhaoying stated that the Chinese government has only learned of the news of the United States and the Soviet Union exchanging letters in Moscow agreeing to use negotiations to improve relations and establish peace from news and telegrams, and does not intend to comment at this time.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] After the news of the publication in Moscow of the exchange of letters between the United States and the Soviet Union agreeing to improve relations and establish peace through negotiation reached the capital, all parties paid close attention, but their views differed. Some believed that this would be a safe way out for the current isolated world situation and expressed optimism, while others emphasized Truman's reaction to this matter, believing that the US-Soviet conflict was still difficult to resolve. Most people held a reserved attitude and continued to wait for its development. A qualified person here recently discussed this issue with reporters, saying that the Soviet Union's approach of publishing such documents without following normal diplomatic channels and methods should receive at least the same, if not more, attention as the content of these documents.

### US-Soviet Relations in Transformation, Hong Kong Market Responds Well

When the Legislative Yuan conducts a vote on the power of consent, it shall vote secretly in an anonymous manner. (2) The handling of cases involving major national interests such as declarations of war and peace negotiations is also specially stipulated, and must be decided in a more solemn manner than general cases.

### The Battle Situation in Western Henan Becomes Increasingly Serious, National Army Command Makes Unification Adjustments, Reinforcements Rush Towards Nanyang

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] A high-ranking military spokesman talked about the battle situation in western Henan: (1) The bandit units of Liu, Chen, etc., who disturbed western Henan, reached a total of twelve columns, with a total strength of about 120,000 people. Their attempt a month ago was to swallow up the local teams. Our side had already seen through their treachery, so we ordered the teams to preserve their strength as much as possible. The recent withdrawal from various strongholds in western Henan was out of our own initiative. In fact, the strength of the teams has not suffered significant losses. (2) He did not deny the seriousness of the battle situation in western Henan, but hinted calmly that the military command in western Henan has recently been unified. In addition to the reinforcements rushing towards Nanyang and Fangcheng from Xinyang and Suiping, there are also National Army troops responding in Yexian. It is expected that the National Army in Nanyang will soon be relieved. The battle situation in western Henan should improve after the 15th. The National Army is currently looking forward to a battle. What is worrying is that the communist bandits will flee elsewhere. (3) He confirmed that Dengxian had been abandoned. It was reported that two columns of bandit troops in Dengxian had the appearance of fleeing south towards Laohekou, but our army in northern Hubei has been prepared, and the bandit army's southward offensive will be difficult to succeed.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] The battle situation in western Henan is becoming increasingly serious. Due to spatial and temporal reasons, our reinforcements failed to relieve the encirclement of Dengxian from the beginning. In addition, the bandit troops of Liu and Chen launched a fierce attack on the city walls of Dengxian with 30,000 troops and artillery on the morning of the 10th. The northeast and northwest corners were almost completely destroyed. The bandit troops were able to take the opportunity to risk their lives and rush into the city. Although our teams launched a strong resistance day and night, fighting hand-to-hand more than ten times, they were ultimately outnumbered, and the situation had not been reversed by the morning of the 11th. According to air force reconnaissance, there was no fighting in Dengxian, and bandit troops were entering the city one after another. The Xixiakou team also took the initiative to withdraw and fought in the suburbs.

[Our Newspaper, Kaifeng, 12th] The teams in Neixiang and Zhechuan counties in western Henan, led by Commander Xue Bingling and Commander Chen Bingde, fought hard for ten days with 150,000 bandit troops who invaded. Although important strongholds were destroyed, they have achieved brilliant results. However, due to the disparity in numbers, they are now forced to retreat to the mountainous areas on the border of Henan and Shaanxi to gather. Commander Xue was once trapped by bandits and the situation was in danger. After two days and nights of mixed battles, he was fortunate to lead his troops to break through and arrived in Laohekou yesterday. Commander Chen led the Zhechuan team to retreat to Liguanqiao, more than 100 miles northwest of Laohekou. The teams in the two counties are currently reorganizing and recuperating, and will still point their spears north to recover their hometowns.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] Our air force flew to Dengxian again on the 12th in bad weather to conduct reconnaissance attacks, and shot and killed dozens of bandits near Liguanqiao (southwest of Dengxian).

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] According to the Jiujiang Command, a total of 4,830 bandits were killed, 4,886 bandits were wounded, and 2,881 bandits were captured in the Dabie Mountain area in April, and a large amount of spoils were seized. It is also learned that the western Henan war has been under the command of the Jiujiang Command since the 6th.

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 12th] A share of Liu's 36th Column, about 2,000 people, invaded Xiping last night, and the situation there was unclear at 7:00 AM on the 12th. Also, another 3,000 bandits arrived in Suiping at dawn on the 12th, and bandit plainclothes teams have been found in Bali Pu (south of Suiping), and it seems that they are moving south.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] Military news: A part of the bandits entrenched in Chaoyang, numbering more than 10,000, fled through Lingyuan towards the plains.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Deng Wenyuan predicted that the Communist Party will launch its eighth offensive in the Northeast before the end of this month.

### Method for Clarifying the Situation in Xinjiang, Reply from Yining Does Not Provide an Answer, Zhang Zhizhong Says He Still Awaits Sincere Expression from Yining

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 12th] Our reporter recently visited General Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Provisional Headquarters, to ask for his opinion on the current Xinjiang issue. The questions and answers are as follows:

Q: It is rumored that Yining has replied to General Zhang's letter. Can you tell us the content?

A: The translated text of Yining's reply is more than 1,000 words long. In addition to repeatedly explaining the so-called "specialties" listed in their previous letter, they also believe that our reply failed to make a fair judgment based on objective facts. However, they avoided answering the five methods proposed in our reply for clarifying the current situation, which should be implemented first by Yining. Although the letter stated that they were willing to return to Dihua for talks, they had to take each of the items proposed in their previous letter as a prerequisite for discussion, with the main item being the removal of Chairman Maswood Sabri. They also added an item requiring the arrest of the two Kazakh leaders, Asan and Dosman Sawan Hariberk, and handing them over to the people for public trial.

Q: Has General Zhang replied to Yining's letter? If so, what is the content?

A: I have replied to the letter, with the general idea: It is regrettable that Yining's reply avoided answering the five methods proposed by me for canceling the special status of the Yining-Tarbagatay-Altay region, which should be implemented first. This is not only what Yining should do under the premise of implementing the peace agreement, but also the minimum factual manifestation of Yining's repeated declarations of vowing to support and safeguard peace in the whole province, support national unity, implement democratic politics, and strengthen ethnic unity. However, Yining only insists on its unilateral demands, which is difficult to understand. Finally, I questioned Yining with a solemn attitude: Do you intend to implement the five methods that I hope you will implement in the two letters I gave you? Are you following a reasonable and legal path? What is your sincerity in resolving the issue based on the peace agreement? And I await a clear answer from Yining.

Q: In General Zhang's estimation, what is Yining's true intention? What is the crux of the problem?

A: I still have confidence in maintaining peace in Xinjiang. However, I do not intend to predict Yining's true intention at this time and will still wait for Yining's expression. However, our established policy of insisting on peaceful reunification, democracy, and unity in Xinjiang is the only way to solve the problem and must not be changed. As for the issue of the provincial chairman, it can be decided by the public opinion of the people of the whole province when the provincial governor election is held. Yining has no reason to request the replacement of the chairman at this time.

Editorial

### Will the Cold War Cease?

Just as the US and the Soviet Union are engaged in a fierce cold war in various parts of the world, the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Molotov, suddenly exchanged letters, both stating their desire to improve current US-Soviet relations and resolve all disputes between the two countries through direct negotiations. These messages of peace do indeed bring us infinite new hope, unfolding before us a prospect of "a light at the end of the tunnel." But will this fiercely fought cold war cease as a result?

First, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the fifth of this month, frankly stating three points regarding the current US-Soviet relations and the international situation: (1) The current international policy of the United States is consistently supported by the American people. No matter what political and economic changes occur domestically, it will continue to be implemented with unwavering determination. (2) The United States government is willing to clearly state that the United States has absolutely no hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union, nor does it harbor any intention of aggression. (3) The American people have expressed disappointment with the current US-Soviet relations, but are still willing to resolve all disputes between the two countries through direct negotiations. This diplomatic letter is indeed full of the United States' desire for peace and sincerity, and can be seen as a prelude to the United States' willingness to compromise with the Soviet Union to jointly create world peace. Therefore, Foreign Minister Molotov immediately replied to Ambassador Smith, responding that the Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards the US government's desire to improve relations between the two countries, and also expresses full agreement with the suggestion to resolve all disputes between the two countries through direct negotiations. Today, when the cold war is about to escalate to bloodshed, and the world is threatened by a third world war, the sudden news of the exchange of letters between the US and the Soviet Union, indicating that the tense atmosphere between the countries will turn into harmony, how can people not rejoice for world peace! Therefore, after the two letters were exchanged and published, people in China, Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries all hoped with joy and excitement that the haze in the international arena would gradually clear and reveal a ray of peaceful sunshine!

However, after reading the Soviet Union's reply repeatedly, although the Soviet Union in principle agrees with the United States' desire for peace and accepts the suggestion to resolve all disputes between the two countries through direct negotiations, the Soviet Union still adheres to its prejudices regarding the current international political situation. Foreign Minister Molotov also solemnly denied three points in his reply: (1) He expressed disagreement with the US government's claim that the deterioration of current US-Soviet relations and the tension in the international situation were caused by the policies adopted by the Soviet Union in Southeastern Europe. (2) He also stated that the Soviet government cannot agree with the US government's claim that the US government's adoption of certain policies in certain foreign countries that aroused Soviet dissatisfaction was the result of Soviet interference in the internal affairs of these countries. (3) The Soviet Union cannot accept the US government's claim that the deterioration of US-Soviet relations was caused by the Soviet government's attitude towards the European Recovery Program. Finally, he solemnly declared that the Soviet Union's policies towards the United States and other countries are entirely based on peace, and that it neither establishes military bases in other countries nor wishes to threaten any country. According to this statement, the Soviet Union's reply is still full of the smell of gunpowder. The Soviet Union neither admits nor assumes any responsibility for the deterioration of US-Soviet relations and the tension in the world situation; instead, it completely attributes the responsibility for the outbreak of the cold war to the United States, which makes us have to doubt whether the Soviet Union has the sincerity to compromise with other countries.

If the Soviet Union cannot, with the demeanor of a great power, deeply reflect on the policies it has pursued since the end of the war, and seek a way to resolve all disputes through direct negotiations in a spirit of mutual tolerance and concession, will US-Soviet relations improve? And will the cold war in various parts of the world be temporarily suspended? Naturally, no one dares to give a definite answer. Therefore, President Truman's amended statement yesterday stated that the purpose of Ambassador Smith's letter to Molotov was to dispel the Soviet government's misunderstandings and confusion about "American policies." The letter only frankly pointed out two points: First, the United States will continue to implement its aid to Europe policy with firm and powerful determination; Second, the United States has absolutely no hostile attitude or aggressive plans towards the Soviet Union, and that is all. President Truman's statement not only swept away the rumors of "US-Soviet compromise" and "peace conferences" that were widely spread outside, but also extinguished the hope of a temporary suspension of the cold war like a flash in the pan, making people who long for world peace feel the sadness of disillusionment. However, after this cold war ceasefire movement returned from brilliance to plainness, it gave the world countless lessons.

First, both the United States and the Soviet Union advocate pacifism. As far as the United States is concerned, the United States not only needs peace, but also is willing to devote all its efforts to creating world peace. Similarly, the Soviet Union also claims to be a staunch advocate of peace and implements a peace policy towards the world. At the same time, the United States and the Soviet Union attack each other. The Soviet Union accuses the United States of being a "war monger," and the United States also points out that the Soviet Union's expansion of power is enough to threaten peace. In the end, who needs peace? Who is destroying peace? In the past, ordinary people could not figure it out, but from the enlightenment gained from this negotiation, it is clear at a glance who supports peace and who does not want peace.

Second, the opposition party in the United States, especially the Wallace faction, often uses "anti-communism is war" as a reason to criticize the current foreign policy of the United States, and actively advocates that the United States should compromise with the Soviet Union to jointly create world peace. In theory, it is very appealing, but in fact, can adopting an appeasement policy towards the Soviet Union be exchanged for Soviet cooperation? This is a serious question. The failure of Ambassador Smith's attempt is enough to prove that this path is also impassable.

Third, in recent years, the United States and the Soviet Union have been engaged in a cold war in various parts of the world. Standing in a third-party position, we always feel that the Soviet Union's cold war tactics are not only brilliant and superior in every way, but also are used freely and take the lead everywhere. The United States is always lagging behind, and almost has no power to "fight back." Under this disadvantageous situation, the United States launched a cold war ceasefire movement, which only exposed its weaknesses and will never achieve its goals. The failure of Ambassador Smith's attempt cannot be concealed by President Truman.

In short, the international situation after the war has evolved to this point, and it has indeed reached a fork in the road of "peace" and "war." Although the United States has shown a conscious awareness, whether the cold war will cease depends on the Soviet Union's choice in the fork in the road of "peace" and "war."

### US Secretary of State Issues Important Statement　No Intention to Negotiate Separately with the Soviet Union　Advocates That It Should Be Handled by International Organizations

[Our Newspaper's Report] New York, 12th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall denied at a press conference today that the US and the Soviet Union are directly discussing any important international issues that could affect other countries. Secretary Marshall said, "Smith has never requested general negotiations with the Soviet Union. Such negotiations should be handled by international organizations such as the Security Council. The United States has no intention of conducting separate negotiations with the Soviet Union. What the United States wants to know is whether the Soviet Union has the sincerity to break the current deadlock in international relations. Smith's recent talks with Molotov have not changed the US policy towards the Soviet Union."

Marshall believes that the United States may issue another statement to the Soviet Union on this issue in the future, but it is not yet prepared to do so. When asked, "If the Soviet Union expresses its willingness to negotiate in a spirit of compromise, will the United States be willing to accept it?" Secretary Marshall was unwilling to give a definite answer, but said that the Soviet Union's expression of readiness to negotiate created a hope that the Soviet Union would be willing to discuss various disputes in international organizations.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] It is reported that the US government will soon ask the Soviet Union what it intends to discuss in order to test the sincerity of the Soviet Union's "peace proposal." The government has not yet come up with a countermeasure to deal with the Soviet Union's surprising peace offensive. Those who control the US countermeasure are still the people who drafted the first note to the Soviet Union, namely President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall. Secretary Marshall will hold a press conference at noon on Wednesday, at which time he will be able to publish his response to the Soviet Union's proposal. Authoritative sources insist that the first US note to the Soviet Union was not intended to suggest a great power meeting, and they do not believe that the Soviet Union is seriously considering this meeting. Officials here believe that the exchange of letters between the two sides does not constitute a basis for reopening negotiations. The two countries are clearly divided and have firm positions. They both believe that their country's policy aims at peace and goodwill, and that all evils should be blamed on other countries. Although Truman's statement on the 11th swept away the excitement, diplomats from the United Nations and foreign countries still hope that this matter can promote other things to happen, so as to reduce the tension in Western Europe and dilute the world's fear of war.

### Molotov Accuses the United States on Various Points　Smith Refutes Them Item by Item　Soviet Union's Promotion of Expansionist Policies Creates a Psychological Fear　The Roosevelt-Litvinov Agreement Has Become Waste Paper

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] After Moscow published Ambassador Smith's letter to Molotov on May 4 and Molotov's reply to Smith, the State Department released Ambassador Smith's letter to Molotov again on May 9 today. Ambassador Smith made the following statement regarding Molotov's claims that the United States is developing military bases, attempting to encircle the Soviet Union, and implementing military threats:

"The entire history of the United States shows that it has always tried its best to eliminate any suspicion of aggression in its policies. However, on the other hand, the unity of Western European countries and the assistance given to Western Europe by the United States directly reflect the doubts caused by the Soviet Union's expansionist policies. The United States has completely sincere intentions in assisting the recovery of Europe, and the American people do not understand the Soviet Union's attitude towards this plan at all. The American people fully understand the Soviet Union's desire and need to establish close and friendly relations with its neighbors. However, the facts and the most reliable witnesses still remember that Czechoslovakia had already accepted the invitation to participate in the European Recovery Program conference, but after Premier Andrej and Foreign Minister Masaryk's visit to Moscow, they suddenly overturned their original decision. Smith went on to state that the United States does not oppose communism because it is Marxism. The United States opposes communism because it has repeatedly discovered that communist minority parties in many countries use illegal methods and disregard the will of the majority of the people to seize power. The United States still believes that such coups by minority parties cannot succeed or even occur without the Soviet Union's moral and material support. Mentioning Soviet trade relations, Smith stated that the United States would be most happy to participate in the development of trade with the Soviet Union under reasonable conditions and with sincere understanding, and to assist the Soviet Republics, which have suffered pain and loss in the war, in economic recovery. Looking at the huge amount of basic factory equipment supplied by the United States to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act, we can understand the sincerity of the United States in assisting the Soviet Union's recovery. As for the recent changes in the United States' trade policy towards the Soviet Union, they are also a direct result of the Soviet Union's adoption of Zhang policies. Smith went on to point out that he had recently reviewed several agreements signed between the United States and the Soviet Union with Molotov, especially the Roosevelt-Litvinov Agreement, and specifically informed him that the only point in that agreement that had not yet been violated by the Soviet Union was the provision allowing one American pastor to reside in Moscow.

Observers pointed out that Smith had answered every point in Molotov's reply point by point, but avoided expressing his opinion on Molotov's suggestion to hold discussions to seek a solution to the differences between the two countries. Judging from the statements of Molotov and Smith, it can be seen that the United States and the Soviet Union will have to deal with very distant differences when holding direct talks. Observers also believe that the State Department's publication of Smith's reply is intended to regain some initiative in this incident, and to make the differences that will be dealt with in direct talks more clearly known to the world.

### Members of the US Congress Express Satisfaction

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Congress was very pleased to learn of the exchange of diplomatic notes between the US and the Soviet Union. Republican Leader Hallock of the House of Representatives stated that the United States has declared to the Soviet Union that it has no ambition to conquer the world and hopes that the Soviet Union can also express this attitude. If a mutually assisting and understanding agreement can be established, it would be a blessing for all people. House Speaker Martin believes that all efforts should be made to seek rapprochement between the US and the Soviet Union. It is gratifying that there is now such an attempt. Senator Connally, a Democrat who participated in the Soviet meetings during the war, believes that this is a valuable move and hopes that relations between the two countries can be improved as a result. Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, although expressing support for the exchange of views between the US and the Soviet Union on seeking rapprochement, is still concerned that the Soviet Union will not change its previous undesirable attitude and methods in negotiations, given previous experience.

### Expanding the Air Force to Seventy Squadrons　US Congress Passes Vote　Senate Military Committee Passes Five-Year Conscription Bill

### Britain Opposes Holding Peace Talks Before the Soviet Union Completely Shows its Cards　Deeply Fearful That the United States Will Fall Into the Soviet Union's Trap

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 12th Broadcast: The British Foreign Secretary addressed the House of Commons today, opposing the US and the Soviet Union holding talks at this time. Bevin said, "Before the Soviet Union completely shows its cards, Britain opposes holding peace talks with the Soviet Union again. I do not want to comment in detail on the exchange of views between the US and the Soviet Union at this time, but I want to frankly state that 'unless there is considerable certainty, Britain is unwilling to participate in any talks. The numerous failures have been disheartening.'"

Bevin also said, "Britain will never delay peace, and the only ones delaying peace are the communists. If an ambassador of a country cannot personally meet with the foreign minister of the country in which he is stationed and secretly report the results of the meeting to his government, but must convey his views in writing and must first publish them in advance, then this situation is not only intolerable, but it is also impossible to find peace."

Another report: In addition to the United States, all European countries are pleased with the direct negotiations between the US and the Soviet Union, and believe that this is a glimmer of hope for lasting peace, which is beneficial and without any harm. Former French Prime Minister Blum said that the firmness of the US attitude, the rapid progress of the sixteen countries in promoting recovery work, and the obstruction suffered by the Comintern in Italy and France have begun to take effect. Italian Foreign Minister Sforza said, "Silence is extremely dangerous, but negotiations are the opposite. Therefore, I am very pleased with the US-Soviet negotiations."

[United Press, London, 12th] British political and diplomatic circles expressed concern on the 12th, deeply fearing that any US-Soviet negotiations would form a new appeasement policy. Diplomatic circles are also fearful that the premonition of the US and the Soviet Union resolving disputes will give a fatal blow to the economic and military unification of the Western European alliance. They suspect that this meeting may affect the possibility of the US giving Western Europe military guarantees. However, well-informed sources believe that Bevin asked for reassurances when he met with US Ambassador Douglas on the 11th. The British side also said that Britain, like other countries, will welcome any genuine and lasting solution between the US and the Soviet Union, but Britain is deeply afraid that the United States will fall into the Soviet Union's trap.

### Pan Youxin's Remarks

[French News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 11th] When asked about the exchange of diplomatic notes between the US and the Soviet Union, Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin replied that the Soviet Union is willing to improve relations with all countries, and the Soviet Union is making every effort to promote a peaceful policy. All the agreements signed by the Soviet Union are based on this principle. Soviet personnel here said that they are quite skeptical about the US move, saying that the US is making this gesture in order to win more votes in the next presidential election.

### Wallace Writes to Stalin　Urging US and Soviet Union to Stop the Cold War

He also suggested that the US and the Soviet Union take the following steps to end the Cold War: (1) universal disarmament and the declaration of all methods of mass destruction as illegal; (2) a ban on any country exporting weapons to any other country; (3) the restoration of unrestricted trade between the US and the Soviet Union (but materials related to war are not included); (4) citizens, students, and journalists of both countries may move freely within each other's countries; (5) the restoration of the free exchange of scientific intelligence and scientific materials between the two countries; (6) the reconstruction of the United Nations or other institutions under the United Nations to undertake international relief affairs.

### Einaudi Elected President of Italy; Inaugurated Yesterday; Will Appoint De Gasperi to Form New Cabinet

[United Press Rome, 12th] Einaudi has been elected President of the Italian Republic for a seven-year term. Mr. Einaudi was inaugurated today and moved into the Quirinal Palace, the Presidential Residence. According to sources close to him, Mr. Einaudi will formally appoint Prime Minister De Gasperi as the new Prime Minister to form a cabinet after Mr. De Gasperi submits his resignation.

[Reuters Rome, 11th] Einaudi, the 75-year-old economic expert and Budget Minister, has been elected by the Italian Parliament in the fourth ballot as the first President of the Italian Republic. Mr. Einaudi received 518 votes, while the other candidate, Orlando, received 320 votes. The left-wing Popular Front and the Italian Social Movement both supported Orlando. Orlando, aged 87, formerly served as Prime Minister and is credited with creating the post-war Italian Constituent Assembly. Einaudi advocates supporting private enterprise and opposes nationalizing businesses, hence the Popular Front's disapproval. When the vote count was completed, Gronchi, Speaker of the joint session of the two houses of Parliament, announced Einaudi as the President of the Italian Republic, and the entire room erupted in cheers. Although the left and right wings did not vote for Einaudi, they still joined the cheers of other parliamentarians. Einaudi is a renowned European economist who has served as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister in De Gasperi's cabinet, and concurrently as Governor of the Bank of Italy. He made outstanding contributions to freezing post-war Italian prices and curbing inflation. Born in Cuneo, Piedmont, Northern Italy, in March 1874, he remained a professor at the University of Turin throughout Mussolini's reign and became Governor of the Bank of Italy in 1945.

### US Government Supports Western European Joint Defense System

Will be Approved by the Senate

[Reuters Washington, 11th] The US government has requested the Senate to pass a resolution formally approving collective defense systems such as the Western European Union. It also declared US support for such systems. The draft resolution was submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today by Under Secretary of State Lovett, following weeks of discussions between Secretary of State Marshall and other State Department officials with congressional leaders. The bill does not directly mention the possibility of the US supplying military goods to Western Europe, or the US concluding a treaty similar to the Anglo-American alliance with Western Europe, but after being passed by Congress, it could indicate that the President, even if replaced by a Republican, would not change the US policy of supporting Western Europe. At the same time, it will show that the US may participate in a transatlantic alliance jointly formed by North America and Western Europe.

### Fire at Warehouse No. 12A, Third Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at the 16th Pier; Major Losses; Sprayed for Three Hours Until Midnight When Fire Was Completely Extinguished; Large Quantities of Silk Yarn and Other Goods Stored Inside; Cause of the Fire Unknown

[Special Dispatch] At 16th Pier in Nanshi, Warehouse No. 12A of the Third Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company suddenly caught fire at 9:30 last night. The wharf security guards discovered the fire and immediately used their own fire-fighting equipment to put it out. However, because the warehouse doors and windows were locked, they could not be opened, and most of the goods piled inside were flammable materials such as soybean cakes, straw mats, native paper, medicinal materials, cotton yarn, and raw silk, making suppression difficult. By 10:05, the flames had broken through the second floor roof, and the fire was raging and uncontrollable. The fire department received the alarm and dispatched a large number of pump trucks to the scene. At the same time, two fire boats from the Jianghai Customs port also arrived to assist in the extinguishing efforts. The fire was brought under control at around 11:00, and the neighboring Warehouse No. 11 was fortunately saved. The remaining fire was completely extinguished by 0:30 this morning. However, most of the warehouse was burned down, and the losses are enormous and cannot be estimated at this time. According to the manager, a large quantity of native paper, straw hats, raw silk, medicinal materials, and cotton yarn had just been loaded into the warehouse from the "Jiangya" ship from Ningbo yesterday morning, and the warehouse was locked at 5:00. Therefore, the cause of the fire, whether it was caused by workers leaving a fire unattended or by spontaneous combustion of the native paper, cannot be determined. When the fire broke out, the police precinct in charge dispatched a large number of officers to guard the area around the fire and cut off traffic.

### A Happy Event in Literary Circles; Feng Zi is Getting Married; Becomes a Bride in Three Days; Marrying a Beautiful American Literary Scholar

[Special Dispatch] Female writer and actress Feng Zi has found love and will become a bride on the 16th of this month. The groom is American youth writer Shapiro.

### Uncompleted Elimination Round: Han Team Judged to Have Abandoned the Game
[Our Reporter's Report] The football elimination match between the Philippines and Hankou was held yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Recreation Ground. Neither team scored in the first half. Ten minutes before the end of the second half, the Philippine team scored a goal through a penalty kick. The Hankou team believed that the referee was biased and protested, which led to a dispute. The Hankou team refused to continue the game and was judged to have abandoned the game. As a result, the Philippines advanced to the second week. Thousands of spectators crowded by the swimming pool, waiting for the athletes to enter the water (Photo by our reporter). A New Mermaid Surrounded by Crowds at the Poolside: A Water Lily Appears and Disappears.

Our reporters Hong Xucai and Yuan Wenzhong.

[Special report from this newspaper]
A Chronicle of the Swimming Pool: Fifty meters long, twenty meters wide, maximum depth of 3.38 meters, minimum depth of 1.24 meters, water volume of 420,000 gallons. It takes 24 hours to fill the pool and 8 hours to empty it. The water is filtered and disinfected every six hours. The pool can accommodate 3,000 swimmers every six hours.

When the morning program started, the air temperature was 74 degrees and the pool water temperature was 68 degrees. When the afternoon program ended, the air temperature was 66 degrees and the pool water temperature was 67 degrees. Huang Wanzhen, one of the sisters from Hong Kong, put her hand in the water and exclaimed, "Oh, it's so cold!"

The command platform was placed in the center of the pond behind the pool, high above everything. A colleague said, "This is like Zhuge Liang's altar borrowing the east wind."

The physiques of the female athletes are not up to standard. Most of them are as thin as children. In fact, some of them are only about thirteen or fourteen years old. Many spectators who came to admire the mermaids must be very disappointed. Many people are missing Yang Xiuqiong.

The comedian Guan Hongda met Wanmi Ya General An Wen'ao. The two of them made a lot of gestures, and the audience didn't watch the swimming, but focused their attention on them.

Changli General Chen Zhennan weighs more than 190 pounds and is full of fat, but he swims very fast. He completed the 1,500 meters in 23 minutes and 17 seconds, leaving the second place more than 300 meters behind. According to the Hong Kong, Yilong asked about the cross-sea competition for 15 years, all undertaken by outsiders. After Chen Zhennan started, he broke their record.

Liu Dibing's results were not good yesterday. Participating in too many events was the main reason. In addition, according to Hong Kong team members, this was his strategy to preserve his strength for the final.

During the men's 50-meter freestyle preliminary, the starting officer gave the order too slowly once. The gun did not sound, and everyone went into the water.

The results of the women's 50-meter freestyle final were all taken by Hong Kong. The Hong Kong team by the pool shouted "Hong Kong, good!"

After Huang Wanzhen broke the national record for the 50-meter freestyle, she was surrounded by layers of photographers, from the inner circle to the outer circle, no less than ten layers.

The most beautiful of the mermaids is Zhang Suyang, the daughter of General Zhang Zhong. She represented Nanjing in the 200-meter breaststroke, and the audience cheered her on.

Several Taiwanese male 200-meter breaststroke athletes took a breath underwater after entering the water, diving about 30 meters. The audience cheered loudly.

Hong Kong female athlete Zeng Fengqun will marry wealthy businessman Xiao Ximing at the Navy Club in this city the day after the National Games ends. Yesterday, she invited Director Chen Bo to be the officiant at the swimming pool. Director Zhen agreed immediately.

Mayor Wu came to the swimming pool at 2:10 PM with his eldest son. He sat high on the command platform and held his son on his lap. The Boy Scout quickly handed over a chair so that the father and son could sit side by side. The mayor watched with relish and smiled happily.

Yu Shunyuan, the first place in the men's 50-meter freestyle final, was immediately surrounded by a large number of photographers after he came out of the water. The Boy Scout was busy asking him to sign his name. At that time, the cool breeze was blowing, and Yu Shun felt cold and couldn't stop shivering. The audience on the stands felt pity, and someone shouted, "Leave him alone, let him put on his clothes before signing!"

After the new mermaid Huang Wanzhen came out of the water, she immediately put on a large towel to keep out the cold, but the photographers insisted on asking her to take off the large towel. A compassionate bystander said, "The photographers are so cruel!" Miss Huang's mother said beside her, "It's cold! It's a sin!" (Note: "It's a sin" is Cantonese, meaning a sin.)

Luo Jinlong, the first place in the 1,500-meter long swim, is very burly, but he is the shyest. He turned red when he saw the reporter. When taking pictures, he sat cross-legged on the ground, looking awkward, like a clay Bodhisattva.

In the women's 200-meter breaststroke competition, Zheng Xueying, the representative of Guangdong and Guangzhou, was the youngest, only thirteen years old. She was less than four feet tall, but she had endurance, good posture, and fast speed. She ranked second and won a lot of cheers.

In order to prevent crowding in the swimming pool, the organizing committee has installed too many fences inside the railings, but most of the audience in the front row jumped out of the wooden fences and stood against the railings. The microphone shouted, "Please move the audience back to the second line of defense, otherwise the railings will collapse, which will be terrible!"

While the swimming competition was in full swing, a plane circled in the sky, distributing leaflets. Everyone was worried that the leaflets would fall into the swimming pool and would obstruct the view and disrupt the order. Fortunately, the wind direction was not favorable, and the leaflets flew out of the venue, and none fell into the pool.

The 50-meter freestyle competition is the most popular among the audience. The athletes swim with agile and neat movements, and the waves splash. The five-color swimming caps appear and disappear in the blue waves, like water lilies.

Ju Zheng Participates in Swimming Competition

Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, came to the conference swimming pool on the morning of the 12th to watch the men's and women's swimming competitions. Reporters and Boy Scouts surrounded President Ju, requesting autographs. The field announcer of the Central Broadcasting Station also invited Ju to give a brief broadcast. Ju first declined modestly, and then held the broadcasting device and said: "The 7th National Games can be held smoothly in Shanghai during the period of suppressing the rebellion and mobilization. It is very difficult. I hope athletes from all over the country can develop the spirit of sports, create unprecedented records, and win glory for the conference, and hope that this will raise the attention of the people across the country to sports."

[Special report from this newspaper] On the first day of the swimming competition, four female athletes from Hong Kong participated: Huang Wanzhen, Huang Wansheng, Gao Miaoling, and Zeng Fengqun. As a result, all four of them scored. Huang Wanzhen won the 50-meter freestyle champion and broke the national record. Gao Miaoling and Zhu Fengqun won the Western Army and the third runner-up respectively. Gao Miaoling also won the first place in the 200-meter breaststroke preliminary, and Huang Wansheng also won the first place in the 200-meter breaststroke preliminary. Everyone did not fail, which is really enviable and enviable.

Huang Wanzhen and Huang Wansheng are from Guangdong and grew up in Hong Kong since childhood. Wanzhen is 18 years old and Wansheng is 17 years old. Both are high school students at St. Stephen's College. They have been swimming for seven or eight years. Today's extraordinary achievements should be attributed to their father. It is said that their father not only gave encouragement, but also used scientific methods to correct their posture and teach them principles. In addition to swimming, the Huang sisters love music, can sing soprano, and can also play the piano. They also like to play ball games. They have never been to Shanghai, and this is the first time. Their mother accompanied them. Their mother takes care of their diet and warmth at all times. When asked about their impression of Shanghai, the answer was very straightforward: "Too bad, too bad, I want to go back to Hong Kong right away." Asked where? They couldn't answer for a while, just said: "Unfamiliar, inconvenient everywhere, not as good as Hong Kong." "However," they all said, "if Shanghai hosts the National Games again next time, then I will still come."

The runner-up Gao Miaoling is also from Guangdong. She is 19 years old and started swimming at the age of nine. She won the Guangzhou and Hong Kong breaststroke champions in 1945 and 1947. Miss Gao's achievements today are due to her mother. She was trained by her mother. Miss Gao is very proud to have such a civilized mother. She said: "My mother is 46 years old this year, but she can still swim with us!" Her mother is a swimmer and also a blessed wife with many children and grandchildren. She has given birth to eleven children. Miss Gao is the seventh child. There are three older brothers, four older sisters, three younger brothers, and one younger sister above. Everyone can swim, but their results are not as good as hers. In addition to swimming, she also likes to run the 50-meter race, and also loves to play basketball and volleyball. She said: "I like all sports, but I am not good at them. I will never give up swimming." A glimpse of the women's dressing room at the swimming pool (Drawn by Lu Shaofei)

Men's Basketball Round Robin in Full Swing; Rouke Gang Filipino Overseas Chinese Win Over Joint Logistics. Dragon Gate and Tiger Cave Change the World.

[Our Reporter's Report] Yesterday, there was only one match in the men's basketball championship round robin, which was the match between the Philippine Overseas Chinese and the Joint Logistics. It started at 3:00 PM. The Joint Logistics is a hard-line style, and the Philippine Overseas Chinese is a soft-line style. The meeting of two strong teams was full of wonderful performances. The Philippine Overseas Chinese performance has reached the ideal and perfect state. Passing is fast and wonderful, and all shots are accurate. Although the Joint Logistics resisted strongly, it was ultimately ineffective. As a result, 64 to 48, the Joint Logistics lost by a difference of 16 points.

Soft Passing as You Wish

After jumping, Joint Logistics Zheng Daguang committed a foul. All members made a free throw and scored a goal. Joint Logistics was fierce and rushed into the enemy camp. Cao Zhiji scored two points. Philippine Overseas Chinese Cai Jindian rushed in and scored near the free throw area. The Philippines attacked again. Five people were handy. Chen Jinzhi made a diagonal shot and scored another goal, arousing the anger of the Joint Logistics. A lightning-like offensive was launched, and the audience cheered. Liao Dihang jumped up and shot in the air without success. Wang Shiyi dribbled the ball into the tiger's den and passed it to Jia Zhijun. Jia scored two points. Zheng Daguang shot again and scored. The Philippine team passed the ball softly. Yu Jin's line attack scored. Wu Kangkai committed a foul, and Jia Zhijun made a free throw. Zhiji intercepted the ball and scored, tying the score at 7-7.

All Shots Hit, Fans Cheer

Philippine Yu Jin passed to Xing Jinzhi. Jinzhi pretended to pass to Chongde, and Jind flipped over, jumped up, and returned to Yu Jin. Yu shot and scored, and applause rang out. Joint Logistics Liao Dihang jumped up and shot from a medium distance and scored. Chen Jinzhi returned two points to him. Chen Jindian added to the cake. Joint Logistics Wang Shixuan rushed out of the gate and shot a long-range shot. 14-11, the Philippine Overseas Chinese took the lead. Jindian was called for a foul, and Jia Zhijun made a free throw. Philippine Chen Jinde turned around and shot, and all the fans cheered. However, in the midst of happiness, Jindian committed another foul, and Zhijun made a free throw. Wu Kangkai scored a goal with one hand. Chen Jinde jumped up and threw again, and was pulled by Wang Shixuan. The ball fell into the net, and Wang was penalized once. Jia Zhijun held the ball and entered, shooting from the end of the baseline and scored. Chen Jinzhi also scored, 23-19, the Philippine Overseas Chinese still took the lead.

At this time, Philippine Li Shiqiao replaced Chen Jindian. The audience welcomed the political party. Li was indeed extraordinary. As soon as he got the ball, he passed it to Kangkai. Kangkai gently threw it, and the ball bounced off the basket and into the net, and cheers rang out. The Joint Logistics launched another offensive. Daguang scored. Chen Jinde committed a foul, and Jia Zhijun made another free throw. Liao Dihang jumped up and scored, 24-26, the Joint Logistics was only two points behind, and the whole audience shouted frantically. However, Joint Logistics Zheng Daguang and Cao Zhiji committed fouls one after another, and Li Shiqiao and Chen Jinde made free throws one after another, 28-26, the Philippine Overseas Chinese took the lead in the first half.

Clever Use of Gunflower, Filipino Overseas Chinese Win

After the break, the two sides deployed and fought again. The Philippine Overseas Chinese used various strategies and played magically, winning applause from the whole stadium. Wang Shixuan and Cao Zhiji could not watch the front and back as they entered the enemy camp. The basket often scored. Although the Joint Logistics tried hard to cheer up, they still attacked with a quick method, but they could not get what they wanted, and none of the shots scored. Zheng Daguang was fouled and left the field, replaced by Zhang Chuanzhi. Philippine Overseas Chinese Wu Kangkai also committed graduation fouls, and Hu Bingkun replaced him. The general trend has been determined. In the end, they lost 64-48, and the Philippine Overseas Chinese won. According to the scoring method of the single round robin system, the Philippine Overseas Chinese scored two points, plus the two points they won against the police, they have scored four points in total.

Inaccurate Shooting, Joint Logistics Regrets

In this battle, the shooting accuracy of the Joint Logistics was still not improved, while the Philippine Overseas Chinese repeatedly corrected their weaknesses. Although the team lacked a center, the three forwards worked closely together to form a seamless whole. Although Liao Qin improved his tactics, he was not as good as the Philippine Overseas Chinese, so the main reason for the Joint Logistics' loss yesterday was inaccurate shooting.

In the battle between Joint Logistics and Shanghai, most of the fans supported the Joint Logistics. Yesterday, when the Joint Logistics met the Philippines, most of the audience cheered for the Philippine team, which proves that the most popular basketball team among Shanghai fans is the Philippines.

In the battle between Shanghai and the Joint Logistics, the Joint Logistics was not convinced of the loss. The Philippines used softness to overcome strength, and the Joint Logistics surrendered willingly. The audience appreciated an unprecedented fierce battle and were all happy.

The Joint Logistics has three "Zhi": Jia Zhijun, Cao Zhiji, and Zhang Chuanzhi. In the first half, they were able to work together, but in the second half, they lost too many points and became unmotivated.

Referee Chang Hong personally acted as the referee. A fierce and fiery decisive battle passed peacefully. Some people said that this was a standard game, with good performances and good refereeing. (Changnian) Second Day of Women's Basketball Round Robin: Indonesia's Good Times Don't Last Long, Difficult to Forge a Good Relationship with the Championship

[Our Reporter's Report] On the second day of the women's basketball round robin, the Philippines played against Indonesia. It started at 2:00 PM yesterday at the conference gymnasium.

Indonesia's Lin Guixin threw one and made one. The Philippines' Huang Rulan returned a goal. Li Xiuli scored, and Indonesia led 5-2. This was Indonesia's golden age. Unfortunately, it was like a flash in the pan. Yang Xiuzhi scored four goals in a row. In the first quarter, Indonesia was behind 11-7.

In the second quarter, Indonesia replaced Lin Suqing with Li Xiuyue. Yang Xiuzhi scored first. Li Xingniang committed a foul, and Huang Rulan made one of two free throws, making it 14-7.

[British News Agency, London, 12th] Ms. He Aiying, a Chinese tennis star who grew up in Hong Kong, recently demonstrated her amazing skills at the Herlingham Tennis Tournament near London.

Zhejiang's 10,000-Meter Athlete, Zhou Juejun, Recovered and Discharged from the Hospital

Shanghai Meets the Police Today; Although It Is Not Difficult for Shanghai to Win, Sincere Cooperation Is Needed

[Our Reporter's Report] Today, there is still only one match in the men's basketball championship round robin, which is Shanghai versus the Police. In terms of the strength of both sides, it should not be difficult for Shanghai to win. However, the predecessor of the Police team was the Chenyou team, which once defeated Dagong by one point and lost to Hualian by one point. This kind of vivid lesson cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, if the Police team plays steadily and fights with strength against Shanghai, Shanghai may encounter a strong opponent; because Shanghai's stamina is poor and cannot fight for a long time. If Shanghai can unite sincerely and cooperate without asking questions, then victory can be assured. However, in fact, there are more phenomena of non-cooperation than cooperation.

After Shanghai looks forward to the Police, it will be the Shanghai-Philippine battle. This match can determine who the champion belongs to?

Yesterday, watching the Philippine Overseas Chinese, they played easily and lively, and cooperated seamlessly. If Shanghai is careless - does not cooperate, does not replace the main force, or the player allocation is improper - then the championship may be lost.

### Another Fine Tale of a Couple United in Old Age: A Twenty-Five-Year Friendship Blossoms into Marriage; Zhang Xiangwen and Wang Gupan Exchange Vows Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] After twenty-five years of friendship, Ms. Zhang Xiangwen and Mr. Wang Gupan, who have now become husband and wife, held their wedding ceremony at the Church of the Savior on Wuyuan Road at nine o'clock yesterday morning. This is yet another fine tale following the example of Li Shizeng and Lin Sushan, who were united in old age.

Both the new husband and wife are well-known figures in society. The bride, Ms. Zhang, is currently the director of both Renhe Hospital and Shangxian Hospital. She is fifty-two years old this year and has consistently dedicated herself to serving in the medical field for decades, nurturing many obstetric talents and benefiting society. The groom, Wang Gupan, is currently the supervisor of the Continental Bank and a director of the Women's Bank. He has previously served as the chief of the Capital Police Department and the mayor of Xiamen, among other positions, making him a pioneer in China's police force. He is currently sixty-four years old. Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Wang represented China at the World Police Conference in New York, where Ms. Zhang was studying in England, and the two became acquainted. Last year, Mr. Wang lost his wife, and his household lacked a caretaker. He then proposed marriage to Ms. Zhang, and Ms. Zhang also expressed that she wanted to avoid loneliness in her later years. As a result, the two entered into marriage on the Lantern Festival of the lunar calendar this year.

Mr. Wang has a single daughter, whose fortunate marriage is to Du Chun, the current director of the Jing'an Branch of the Municipal Police Department. Ms. Zhang's nephew is Zhang, who is the chief of the Municipal Government's Protocol Section. Both of them are well-known figures in various circles. Yesterday, both of them were in the auditorium to receive guests.

Among those who attended the ceremony yesterday were Municipal Police Chief Yu Shuping, Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei, former Chongqing Mayor He Yaozu, figures from the banking and pharmaceutical industries in the city, and approximately 600 students of Ms. Zhang from Renhe Midwifery School. The bride wore a white satin gown, a white long veil, held lilies in her hands, and had white silk flowers in her hair. As she slowly entered the auditorium with the wedding march playing, her shyness resembled that of a young maiden. The female attendant was Dr. Zhu Changya, the director of medical affairs at Shangxian Hospital, who wore a white floral satin cheongsam with small red flowers and white embroidered edges. Besides the newlyweds, she was one of the most eye-catching figures at the ceremony. The male attendant was E Yukun, the deputy director of the Police Department.

The wedding adopted a Christian ceremony, which was extremely solemn and grand. Bishop Luo Peide presided over the ceremony, and President Lin Buji assisted. The newlyweds prepared for the wedding very meticulously and specially printed pink wedding order leaflets. The program included items such as "Questioning the Two Parties," "Expressing Affection to Each Other," "Pledging Eternal Love," "Exchanging Rings," and a joint chorus by the guests and special choir of "Complete Love Song" and "Respectful Harmony Song." After the ceremony, the newlyweds walked out of the church hand in hand, their faces full of joy, and immediately boarded a car to their new home in the city center of Jiangsheng. The bride's mother, Old Mrs. Zhang, is now seventy-three years old and was delighted to see her beloved daughter get married, her joy evident in her expression. The newlyweds went to Hangzhou in the afternoon for their honeymoon, planning to return to Shanghai in a week. (The attached photo is of the newlyweds, taken by this newspaper.)

### Official-Merchant Collusion, Intimidation, and Fraud: A Trap Set for Diesel Purchase; Reported by the Hong Kong Committee and Cracked; Prosecution Filed by the District Procuratorate After Interrogation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Grain merchant Wu Borong, merchant Jiang Zhenyuan, Dai Ronggui, and Yang Yuanzhen, supervisor of the Investigation and Guard Group of the Shanghai Port Consolidation Committee, were prosecuted by the District Procuratorate yesterday on charges of intimidation and fraud. The indictment stated the following facts of the crime: "Wu entered into a contract with Zhang Yaonian on February 26 of this year to sell 50 tons of diesel, stipulating that the goods would be delivered on March 2, guaranteed by Dai Ronggui of the Detai Foundry. Zhang Yaonian first delivered to Wu Borong a check for 240 million yuan in legal tender as a prepayment. When the deadline arrived, Wu Borong reneged on the agreement and conspired with Dai Ronggui, Jiang Zhenyuan, Chi Antai, and Yang Yuanzhen, supervisor of the Investigation and Guard Group of the Shanghai Port Consolidation Committee, to devise a scheme. On the morning of the 4th of the same month, Wu notified Zhang Yaonian by telephone, falsely claiming that the goods had been detained by the Investigation and Guard Group of the Hong Kong Committee as having an unknown origin and instructing him to avoid the area to avoid arrest. Then, Chi Antai and Yang Yuanzhen went to Zhang Yaonian's home, falsely claiming to be acting under the orders of the Hong Kong Committee to arrest him. In the afternoon, Dai Ronggui came forward and invited Zhang to meet at the Nanguo Restaurant, where he extorted 30 million yuan from Zhang Yaonian under the guise of the Hong Kong Committee needing funds. Zhang believed this to be true and issued a check for 30 million yuan from the Xuxu Bank, which was received by Jiang Zhenyuan. The matter was reported to the Investigation and Guard Group of the Hong Kong Committee, who investigated and seized the check for 30 million yuan from Jiang's possession and sent the case file to the Investigation Department for investigation," and so on.

### National Games Swimming Competition Begins: Hong Kong Mermaids Show Their Skills; National Record Broken in Women's 50-Meter Freestyle; Huang Wanzhen Achieves a Time of 35.9 Seconds; Football and Basketball Games Reach Their Peak, Major Battles Continue Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the eighth day of the 7th National Games, and the swimming championships officially began at 10:00 AM at the stadium swimming pool. The morning program lasted until 12:00 PM, and the afternoon session continued from 2:00 PM until a break at 5:30 PM. The temperature throughout the day hovered around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, while the water temperature was only about 67 degrees Fahrenheit. However, Hong Kong's Huang Wanzhen still broke the national record of 36 seconds held by Yang Xiuqiong with an excellent time of 35.9 seconds in the women's 50-meter freestyle final, which was the most valuable achievement of yesterday's swimming competition. In addition, excellent results included Hong Kong's Chen Zhennan, who finished first in the first group of the men's 1,500-meter freestyle preliminaries with a time of 23 minutes and 1.7 seconds, approaching the national record. As for other groups, it is thought that they have yet to show their outstanding results, as they are still in the preliminary and semi-final stages.

Yesterday, the poolside was crowded with spectators all day long, especially in the afternoon. President Ju, Mayor Wu, and Director Chen Bozhuang of the Railway Bureau all visited the pool to watch the competition and were very interested.

The swimming competition will continue today. It is hoped that the weather will be sunny and the temperature will rise, so that the male and female mermaids can show their best skills and satisfy the audience's eye.

All ball games have entered the championship round-robin finals, and only the last four players remain in the men's and women's singles tennis events, which will begin to advance to the final stage today. The football round-robin competition was the first act yesterday, with the Army defeating Shanghai and Hong Kong tying with the Police. The track and field stadium was filled with 30,000 to 40,000 spectators, making it an extremely grand occasion. Today is the second act, with the Police facing Shanghai and Hong Kong facing the Army, and another fierce battle will unfold. The round-robin finals of men's and women's basketball, volleyball, and softball are continuing. The women's singles table tennis champion has already been determined, and it is Miss Liang Yujie from Hong Kong. The ball game finals are a close contest, with each step being more tense than the last.

### Hong Kong Dominates on the First Day: Red-Capped Mermaid Huang Wanzhen Creates a New 50-Meter Record; 35.9 Seconds Breaks Yang Xiuqiong's Old Record

[Our Newspaper's Report] The women's 50-meter freestyle final, which was the focus of the entire stadium, was held at 3:15 PM yesterday. All eight mermaids who were selected in the preliminary round participated in the competition. Among them, the Hong Kong team accounted for three members: Huang Wanzhen, Gao Miaoling, and Zeng Fengqun. Wanzhen, wearing a bright red rubber cap, stood on the eighth lane, which was particularly eye-catching. Miaoling, wearing a light yellow cap, was also a dangerous target. When the starter raised his gun and shouted "Take your positions...", the entire audience held their breath and waited for the scene of breaking the national record to unfold. As the gun sounded, eight mermaids were seen rushing into the pool, splashing a burst of silver spray. Unfortunately, Wanzhen was the slowest to enter the water, so Miaoling's yellow cap was seen leading the group for the first 20 meters. After 30 meters, Wanzhen's red cap gradually emerged. At 40 meters, she took the lead, and Wanzhen's championship had an absolute advantage at this point. Miaoling was three or four meters behind, and Zeng Fengqun was about five meters behind. Ma Hua's Lin Qingyin, He Yanxiuyu, and others closely followed behind. The red-headed mermaid finally reached the finish line first amidst cheers. Standing up and looking at the other mermaids, who were still struggling in the water, she couldn't help but reveal a victorious smile. Then, the yellow-headed mermaid Miaoling arrived. The other mermaids also followed the wave and arrived one after another. Looking at the roster, it was found that the Hong Kong team swept the top three. The order was Huang Wanzhen, Gao Miaoling, and Zeng Fengqun. Followed by Ma Hua's Lin Qingyin, Taiwan's Yan Xiuyu, and Siam China's Zhang Lu, etc. The first place was achieved in 35.9 seconds, breaking the national record of 36 seconds held by Yang Xiuqiong. If the climate and water temperature were slightly higher yesterday, and Wanzhen had not been late to enter the water, she should have achieved a better result. Now, we can only leave it to the 8th National Games to improve.

### Hong Kong Takes an Absolute Advantage with Ease

Eight Hundred Meter Relay

[Our Newspaper's Report] The men's 800-meter freestyle relay ice team originally had eleven teams registered to participate. Who knew that this program would be the grand finale and would only be held after 5 o'clock? At that time, the air temperature was only 66 degrees, and the water temperature was 67 degrees. Taking off their clothes, they couldn't help but shrink and shiver. As a result, only seven teams, including Hong Kong, Malaya, Taiwan, Guangdong-Guangzhou, Philippine Chinese, and the Shanghai Navy, participated in the competition. The competition was temporarily changed to a final. Each team had four members, and each person swam 200 meters. In the first leg, Philippine Chinese's Zhuang Meidao took the lead and flowed through the entire course in one breath, throwing Hong Kong's Huang Jinhua more than ten meters behind. Hong Kong's second leg Liu Dibing temporarily abandoned the 50-meter semi-final due to leg cramps, rested and recuperated, and fully exerted his strength in the 800-meter second leg relay. As a result of the hard battle, the Philippine Chinese second leg was defeated. When Dibing swam the entire course, he had thrown the Philippine Chinese second leg more than ten meters behind. Hong Kong's third leg, Cai Liheng, did not disgrace his mission, swam the entire course, and still maintained the Hong Kong team's leading advantage. In the last leg, Hong Kong's long-distance swimming star Chen Zhennan personally went into the water, swimming clearly and beautifully, and easily won the championship. The Philippine Chinese second leg was too weak, and to make matters worse, not only was it defeated by Hong Kong, but it was also overtaken by the Malayan team, which was still in third place in the first leg, in the second leg. After that, the Malayan third and fourth legs, Zhong Yaobi and Huang Yafa, etc., did not disgrace their mission and maintained the runner-up position to the end. Looking back at the Philippine Chinese team, they fell behind again in the third leg, almost losing their third-place position. Fortunately, Cai Youchu, the last leg, made great efforts and chased desperately, and finally managed to retrieve the third-place position. The Guangdong-Guangzhou and Taiwan teams fought fiercely for fourth and fifth place, and as a result, Guangdong-Guangzhou defeated Taiwan by a hair's breadth. The rankings are as follows: (1) Hong Kong, (2) Malaya, (3) Philippine Chinese, (4) Guangdong-Guangzhou, (5) Taiwan, (6) Navy. The first place was achieved in 11 minutes and 4.3 seconds, and the second place was achieved in 11 minutes and 44.5 seconds.

### Hong Kong Athlete Liu Dibing Withdraws Due to Leg Cramps

### Indonesian Athlete Yu Shunyuan Achieved Good Results Yesterday

### "Airbag" Chen Zhennan Is Unmatched

Men's Fifteen Hundred Meters

The men's 1,500-meter freestyle is Chen Zhennan's world. He created a record of 23 minutes and 1.7 seconds in the preliminary round yesterday, and almost no one can match him (the national record is 22 minutes and 59.2 seconds). If the temperature warms up during the final, Chen Zhennan has a great hope of breaking the national record.

The preliminary round was originally divided into six groups yesterday, but since many people temporarily withdrew, the third and fourth groups and the fifth and sixth groups were combined into two groups to be held. Except for Chen Zhennan, the next best result in each group was Tianjin athlete Luo Jinlong's 25 minutes and 1.4 seconds, which was relatively good.

### Huang Wenzhuo, Rong, and Other Three Generals Won the Championships in Three Groups Respectively

Men and Women Breaststroke Competition

In the men's 200-meter breaststroke preliminary round, three Hong Kong generals won the championships in three groups respectively, among which Huang Zhuorong's score of 3 minutes and 13.6 seconds was relatively excellent.

In the women's 200-meter breaststroke, Hong Kong's Huang Wansheng took an absolute advantage with a score of 3 minutes and 44.4 seconds, which was almost equal to the scores of the men's group losers. It is expected that Huang will easily win the championship in today's final. As for Zheng Xueying, a 14-year-old athlete from Guangzhou, both her posture and speed are not weak, and her future prospects are limitless.

### Football Four Strong Teams Fight Each Other: Shanghai Lost to the Army 0 to 3; Hong Kong Tied with the Police 1 to 1; Shanghai Faces the Police Today; Hong Kong Team Fights the Army

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the first day of the football championship round-robin, the Army defeated Shanghai 3-0 in the first game at 2:00 PM yesterday, and Hong Kong tied with the Police 1-1 in the second game at 4:00 PM. The match between the Police and Hong Kong was exceptionally tense and full of highlights, while the Shanghai team was completely relaxed, allowing the Army team to easily win three cities. Judging from the trend on the first day, the Army team has already gained two points, and the two strong teams of the Police and Hong Kong are each lagging behind by one point. The Shanghai team's line is disorganized and can't withstand a single blow. If they face the Police with the same lineup today, they will undoubtedly repeat their mistakes, and the Police can take the lead with three points. The Army will face Hong Kong this afternoon. In terms of strength, the Hong Kong team is better. If the Hong Kong team can gain two more points in this game, the situation of Hong Kong and the Police standing on top will be formed. If the Hong Kong team loses to the Army, the Army will suddenly increase by four points, and the overall situation will be completely changed. Therefore, if the Hong Kong team wants to win the championship and runner-up, today's battle is a crucial key. Looking back at yesterday's battle, both the Hong Kong and Police teams have performed above the standard, appearing to be in top form and difficult to distinguish. Those who admired the skills of the two teams and rushed to the track and field stadium to watch the match reached nearly 40,000 to 50,000 people, with the grand occasion surpassing the track and field finals the other day. During the competition yesterday, the Police team played music to cheer them on, and senior military and police officers came to the field to cheer them on. The audience also rushed down from the stands, encroaching on the football field. After the guard team's repeated persuasion, the competition was able to continue. The enthusiasm was unprecedented.

### The Army's Tactics Improved; The Shanghai Team's Position Was Scattered

The Shanghai vs. Army match started at 2:00 PM, with referee Li Fenglou and linesmen Bu Xiaochang and Li Guoyi. After the Shanghai team kicked off, they lost control of the entire field. The Army team's forwards waited in front of the goal, creating dangerous situations. Fortunately, Xu Fusheng was alert and there were no mistakes. However, the Army was determined to win. Gao Xiuqing, Zhang Jinhai, and Jin Lusheng jointly attacked and passed the ball three times. Gao shot from the left corner, and Xu Fuxiang saved it, but Gao bumped into him, and the record was opened. After that, within a few minutes, Gao Xiuqing received a pass from Fei Chunhua and faked a kick in front of the goal. Xu Fuxiang saved and fell, and Gao calmly picked up the ball, ending the first half at 2-0.

In the second half, Gao Xiuqing of the Army team was injured and replaced by Wang Xingguo. And Luo Shoufu received a pass from Jin Lusheng and scored another goal, 3-0. The Shanghai team was惨遭defeated.

In yesterday's Shanghai-Army battle, the Army's tactics and individual skills were better than in the previous battle against Malaysia, while the Shanghai team's position was scattered and their movements were slow. Whenever they slightly advanced, the team members could not quickly搶control the situation. They were slow and lacked coordination, and the opportunities were always lost. Left-back Zhang Lingen was病 sluggish, and he often could not搶先機prevent dangerous balls from coming. His precautionary measures can be said to be the main reason for the defeat. This point must be paid special attention to when the team fights the Police today. The lineups of both sides in yesterday's battle were as follows:

Army Team

Qin Bigao Zhang Renyi (down) Wu Kaimin (up) Wu Qizuo Qu Yongfu Meng Yiliang Xue Peiran Jin Lusheng Luo Shoufu Zhang Jinhai Gao Xiuqing Fei Chunhua

Shanghai Team
