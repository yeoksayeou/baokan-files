The offensive of the bandits surrounding Jinzhou and Jinxi is reportedly weak, and there is a situation where they are changing to a "siege and reinforce" tactic. Currently, the bandit units surrounding Jinzhou are the Ren Column in the east, the 9th Column in the west, the 7th Column in the south, and the 3rd Column in the north. It is also rumored that the bandits are building fortifications, attempting to withdraw their main forces.

### Liu Zhe and Others Propose in the Supervisory Yuan to Rescue Northeast Grain, Propose Measures to Investigate Past Deceptions, Resolved to Proceed in Parallel

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The "Proposal to Urgently Alleviate the Suffering and Save People from Danger by Seeking Ways to Provide Relief to Value People's Lives" proposed by Liu Zhe, Deputy Director of the Supervisory Yuan, and nine others regarding the Northeast grain issue was discussed at a meeting of the Supervisory Yuan at 3:00 pm on the 5th, and it was resolved to proceed in parallel. The first item of the measures listed in the original proposal will be handed over to the Finance and Food Committee and the Transportation Committee to study and decide whether to approve it. The second to fourth items will be handed over to the Northeast Administrative Office to conduct a thorough investigation and decide on handling, and the Director of the Yuan will invite Food Minister Guan Jiyu to the Director's residence at 9:00 pm on the 5th to exchange views on grain transportation issues with the Supervisory Commissioners from the Northeast. All Supervisory Commissioners familiar with this case can sign their names immediately and jointly send a telegram to the President, requesting the relevant personnel to handle it quickly to save lives. Liu et al.'s original proposal stated: "It is believed that the lack of grain in the Northeast and the starvation on the roads have reached the point where people are eating each other. The tragic situation is difficult to describe in writing. Recently, a telegram was received from Changchun stating that more than 100,000 people have starved to death in the area between the Nationalists and Communists. If relief is not urgently provided, the number of deaths due to starvation will increase daily. We must not only seek solutions urgently but also investigate past deceptions. The proposed measures are listed below, along with the circumstances of past deceptions: (1) Investigate the purchase of southern grain by the Northeast Regulation Bureau, which is still stored in Tianjin, Huludao, and other places. Ascertain the amount in storage and urgently transport it by air to save lives. (2) Former Director Chen Cheng felt as early as the 36th year that the people's food supply was insufficient, so he established a grain purchasing organization and allocated purchasing funds of up to more than 50 billion circulation tickets (at that time, one US dollar was equal to 3,350 national currency). It can be said that he foresaw the matter. However, after many days, no grain was purchased, and inflation worsened daily. It is rumored that someone used this money to earn interest. Director Chen once reprimanded them in person. Please provide a detailed statement on whether this is the case. (3) The issue of the Minsheng Farm: We do not know who runs the Minsheng Farm. This farm was left by the Japanese invaders. When acquiring this farm, they reported more acreage than they actually had, doing their best to deceive. They also fraudulently claimed agricultural implements and seeds provided by the United States to the Northeast and secretly sold 40 tons of American wheat seeds. The farm claimed more than 10 tons but did not plant a single grain, selling all of it and pocketing the money, causing the Relief Administration to be unwilling to provide more supplies to the Northeast, greatly affecting international opinion. (4) The Northeast Materials Regulation Bureau entrusted various merchants to handle the relief food for the Northeast, but it is rumored that someone used the name of a merchant to claim funds, did not make any purchases, and transported out more than 10,000 bags of flour, earning a profit of 15 billion yuan, which is very strange. Based on the above points, we intend to send a document to the Executive Yuan to quickly devise a plan for air transportation of grain and, at the same time, instruct the Supervisory Commissioners in the Northeast to conduct a thorough investigation and then file an impeachment, so that the number of corrupt officials and starving people can be reduced at the same time, then our hearts can be slightly at ease."

### Responsibility for the Fall of Jinan Decided to be Subjected to a Corrective Action

### To Prevent Communism, It Must Be Advanced in Both Asia and Europe

Chen Lifu Meets with Foreign Reporters and States

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] Chen Lifu, Deputy Director of the Legislative Yuan, who recently returned from a visit to Europe and the United States, told United Press reporters on the 5th that if communism cannot be prevented in Asia, especially in China, the Marshall Plan will be a failure. He said: The "Europe First" regional strategy in World War II is clearly no longer applicable today. In the past, the Allied goals were Germany and Japan, which could be handled separately, but today the Western democratic countries are rising up to confront the unified center of communism. Chen said: "If the United States only implements the Marshall Plan in the West and does not provide similar assistance to the East at the same time, communism will accelerate its development in Asia. Therefore, we must prevent the spread of communism on both fronts simultaneously, and an Asian Marshall Plan would be a wise move." Chen's remarks were made after the Central News Agency reported that the United States was considering an Asian Marshall Plan, and they are generally seen as a preliminary official Chinese response to the US House Appropriations Committee's urging to step up aid to China.

In the past, the income from Shanghai's commodity tax accounted for about 58% to 62% of the total commodity tax.

The original budget for total commodity tax income was more than 34.013 million gold yuan, which has now been increased to more than 163.11 million gold yuan. To achieve the budget figures, it is necessary to strengthen supervision of taxation. It is currently the peak month for tax revenue.

Horse and mule meat and bran noodles are the main items for sale. A month ago, there were rows of people selling tattered clothing along the streets, but now they are no longer visible. After the cessation of inland remittances, some citizens did not dare to go south lightly because they had nowhere to turn in the interior, and they were extremely depressed. After the outbreak of the Jinxi War, Changchun had no planes in the air for seven days.

### Preventing National Enterprises from Raising Prices: The Legislative Yuan Schedules a Formal Discussion for the 8th, and Inquiries to the Executive Yuan Regarding Disaster Relief and Tax Reduction Measures

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The eighth session of the second term of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 5th, chaired by President Sun. After the meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan first reported on collected materials concerning news reports that had revealed secrets of the Yuan. Following this, the reported matters were handled, the minutes of the seventh session were approved, and it was resolved to submit the Executive Yuan's submitted proposals for review. The draft proposal for the general budget review procedure, which was temporarily put forward by the Budget Committee, was returned for review after substantial revisions. Then, the discussion items began. The first case was Qian Nashui's proposal to relieve the victims of floods in various provinces and reduce taxes in disaster areas. It was resolved to submit an inquiry to the Executive Yuan, requesting a response regarding the relief measures adopted for each disaster area. The second case was Zhao Erkang's proposal to request the Executive Yuan to instruct the salt affairs authorities to allocate special funds from the salt field construction fees increased with taxes to maintain and develop the welfare of salt workers. It was also resolved to submit an inquiry to the Executive Yuan, requesting a response regarding what kind of subsidies were provided for the welfare of the workers after the cancellation of the salt worker welfare subsidy fee attached to the salt tax to prevent its stagnation. The third case was Jin Shaoxian's proposal to request the Executive Yuan to instruct various ministries to submit periodic reports on the implementation of policies to the Legislative Yuan. It was resolved in principle to pass and refer to the Procedure Committee to formulate measures and report to the Yuan meeting. The meeting adjourned at around 12 noon.

The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] More than fifty members of the Legislative Yuan, jointly conspired, and proposed an emergency temporary motion in the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 5th: "Immediately Request the Executive Yuan to Stop National Enterprises from Raising Prices," believing that the government has promulgated an emergency financial and economic decree, freezing prices, and has severely sanctioned merchants who destroy the price limit. Most merchants can still abide by the laws, but the Executive Yuan's political meeting actually discussed the case of state-owned professional price increases, which is the same as leading the price increase, and it is no different from destroying the laws and losing the trust of the people. If state-owned enterprises increase prices, private enterprises can take the opportunity to increase prices. The dangerous situation of soaring prices will surely develop, affecting the value of gold yuan notes. Then this currency system reform will inevitably fail. Therefore, it is advocated that when the emergency financial and economic decree is strictly implemented and prices have not yet stabilized, state-owned enterprises must not increase prices for any reason, and three measures are proposed: (1) If the revenue and expenditure of state-owned enterprises cannot be balanced, personnel should be laid off and downsized immediately. (2) The adjustment of prices of state-owned enterprises should first complete the legislative procedures. (3) Stop the immediate proposed price increase of state-owned enterprises to avoid stimulating public sentiment and affecting the monetary system. After this case was proposed at the end of the meeting on the 5th, the committees believed that the matter was important and resolved to include it in the agenda of the ninth meeting on the 8th for formal discussion.

### Editorial: The Kurusu Incident and the Crisis of the Ashida Cabinet

The Japanese Ashida Cabinet, which appeared in the form of the former Katayama Cabinet's "old store newly opened" on March 10 of this year, has been in power for seven months. During these more than half a year, the Ashida Cabinet has experienced hardships. The huge budget案 for this year, the Nishio Vice Minister's bribery案, and the labor潮 and civil servant怠工潮, followed one after another, causing the Cabinet to be overwhelmed. After Ashida運甲 used his flexible skills to deal with this series of storms, he was holding great hope for the future of "centrist politics" when the Showa Electric Industrial Large-Scale Fraud案 suddenly broke out again. Kurusu Takeo, Minister of the Cabinet Economic Stabilization Headquarters, was arrested by the Tokyo Prosecutor's Office on September 30, and there was talk of summoning Ashida. This疑獄 incident involved many people. Under the accusations of public opinion, the Cabinet was surrounded by crises, and the opposition took the opportunity to force Ashida Cabinet to resign completely. The original alliance of the three parties also showed a split due to the疑獄 incident: The special議會, which was originally delayed, had to be announced to be held on October 11. Although the Democratic Party and Ashida's能度 expressed considerable strength and were not afraid of the new offensive launched by the opposition due to the Kurusu incident, the decline in the government's reputation and the separation of the government and the party were inevitable. The fate of the Ashida Cabinet is tied to a few changes between旦夕.

The Kurusu incident is a political poverty 汚案. From the perspective of Japanese politics, it is a serious situation. It not only constitutes Kurusu's personal disgrace but also constitutes the disgrace of the Democratic Party and the current regime. Regardless of the severity of Kurusu's criminal responsibility, Prime Minister Ashida and the Cabinet should角 considerable administrative responsibility. According to the "Tokyo Shimbun" on October 1, the truth of the案 is that when the Ashida Hitoshi Cabinet was formed at the beginning of this year, in order to combat the opposition party and争取 a majority for the ruling party, a large amount of money was spent. Ashida may be responsible for executing this money, and the Governor of the Bank of Japan一萬田尙登 and the Minister of Health and Welfare武田儀一 were both involved in this案. Kurusu attracted this money, and it was found that it came from Showa Electric Industrial會　. President Hino原 has already admitted to the court that the donation did happen. In order to conduct偵察 and審訊, in addition to arresting Kurusu and his secretary Sanmoto Tsunehiko (former secretary-general of the興業 Bank), the court also搜査 the residences of一萬田 and 武田. The police局 has also ordered the便拘捕. Obviously, this political corruption案 is very serious, much more serious than the Nishio incident! Nishio accepted "political donations" from the "Civil Engineering Construction Industry Association," amounting to only馮 500,000 yen. Kurusu accepted donations from "Showa Electric Industrial會社," and the amount was even larger, and there was suspicion of using his authority. This incident has long constituted an open secret in Japanese politics. Now that it has been revealed and become a tool for political struggle, it is not only to drag down the Ashida Cabinet but also to fade Ashida from the鲜艷 political flower bud. Therefore, it is said that the occurrence of the Kurusu incident has a very significant影饗 on Ashida's fate.

Since the Meiji Restoration, Japanese political parties have not established a solid foundation. The so-called political parties representing class interests do not take root in the masses but grow on the shoulders of the royal family or the military閥財閥. The political綱政策 is from top to bottom, and the political funds are also from top to bottom.　弊 is inevitable and has deepened generation by generation. Regarding the abuses in the general election last April, there was the revelation of the Nishio bribery incident in the Socialist Party, and now there is the 검 of the Kurusu bribery incident. Although the former has already been实吿无罪 by the court, it is not yet known how the latter案 will be sentenced, but the serious situation is difficult to completely cover up these open secrets. "The Liberal國民" magazine published in Tokyo on June 10 this year published a behind-the-scenes expose of Japanese politics. The round table record revealed the inside stories of various political parties and the secrets of the Tod田内閣 without遗. The magazine criticized the Ashida Cabinet as a "渣子 Cabinet" and also called it the "Showa Electric Industrial Cabinet." The so-called 渣子 refers to the fact that a third party with less than 100议员 obtained the premiership, which is unreasonable for democratic politics: The so-called "Showa Electric Industrial Cabinet" means that Showa Electric Industrial會社 gave the Democratic Party a large number of "political donations" in connection with the loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Showa Electric Industrial once said to the Democratic Party: As long as they can support Ashida, they can take out 8 million to 10 million yen. It is said outside that the amount of Showa Electric Industrial's donation is hundreds of millions of yen, of which 50 to 60 million yen is for the "understanding fee" of various political parties. The remaining 50 to 60 million yen is the cost of buying off议员 from the nomination of Ashida to the completion of the Ashida cabinet. This huge sum of money was passed through Kurusu's户. Kurusu obtained the position of Minister of the Economic Stabilization Headquarters because of this transaction. Kurusu was originally from the Democratic Party. His relationship with Inukai健 Ashida Hitoshi was not deep, and his reputation in Japanese political party relations was not隆. He climbed to a high position due to this disgraceful cause, in charge of the economic recovery plan of defeated Japan, and took the會党's "carefully structured" "五年　与计划草案" as his own. Kurusu naturally could not avoid falling交. However, this time, the fall was too great, and the incompetence and greed of Japanese bureaucratic politics were ruthlessly exposed.

The Kurusu incident constitutes a crisis for the Ashida Cabinet, which is undoubtedly true. But will the Ashida Cabinet collapse because of this? First, it depends on how Ashida handles the "Prohibition of Civil Servant Strike Law" during the period of this special議會. This can be measured. In general, it is good or bad for the current regime. Secondly, it depends on how the Democratic Party resists the Democratic Liberal Party and strives for

The Unity of the Association and the Two Parties to Overcome This Difficulty. The 수정起草 of the "Prohibition of Civil Servant Strike Law" was MacArthur's letter to Ashida　理 on July 22. The Ashida Cabinet issued a政令 on August 1 based on this调示, and made factual revisions to the "National Public Service Law," prohibiting civil servants from striking and any "labor offensive." The main month of the convening of this special会？ is to legalize and rationalize this temporary emergency measure. If the議会 does not pass it, MacArthur will not be happy. Today, no Japanese political party resists the Allied Headquarters. Therefore, Ashida may use this案 as a护身符 to delay the life of the current regime. The Allied Headquarters is quite concerned about the "Prohibition of Civil Servant Strike Law" and has not made any statement on the Kurusu incident. Ashida made a special trip to visit the Allied Headquarters for this matter. From the Democratic Party's firm statement that the Cabinet will never resign, it seems that the Allied Headquarters does not want to expand the situation of the案. Therefore, the Democratic Party has become stronger. As for the opposition party, needless to say, the Democratic Liberal Party wants to oppose the government and demand a general election. The status of the first party has been firmly established. The Socialist Party, the government and the party, has a very崛態度 towards the Kurusu incident this time.

The 左右派 of the 會　 both advocate the total resignation of the Cabinet, and say that even if the next regime falls into the hands of the extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party, they will not care, because the occurrence of the Kurusu incident in the Ashida Cabinet is really 无颜 to face the people of the country." Their explicit determination to overthrow the cabinet is evident on paper. The Socialist Party's hard words about the Kurusu incident have the effect of retaliating against Ashida's improper handling of the Nishio incident. The Ashida Cabinet was produced with the support of the Socialist Party.　Ashida Nishio's private affair is solved by the person who tied the bell. If the air of the Socialist Party's倒閣 is truly firm,　　Ashida's one-man effort is difficult to stand　的.

The government　一 and the party國民協同黨 have also expressed the view that the Cabinet must resign completely. Seeing the situation, the Ashida Cabinet is isolated and helpless. Unless the Allied Headquarters firmly supports it, or Yoshida of the Liberal Party suddenly turns to cooperate with Ashida, the current regime will have a hard time surviving today's dangerous境.

### Stabilizing the Domestic Situation and Hoping to Obtain More US Aid: 500 Million US Dollars Needed Annually to Balance the Budget, Stated by the Minister of Land and Finance at a Press Conference in Washington

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Chinese Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu stated at a press conference on the 4th that he hoped to obtain more US aid to stabilize the economic and political situation in China. Wang continued, "I am extremely burdensome for the progress of the currency system reform implemented on August 19, "We hope to receive foreign aid in the next year and beyond, and at the same time we are trying our best and hope to show that we are determined to help ourselves." Wang also stated that in the current stage of adopting a defensive posture against the共 Party in North China, there is a deficit of 30 percent in the annual budget, about 300 million US dollars, part of which is covered by issuing government bonds. He pointed out that if the government takes an offensive posture, the fiscal deficit will be even greater unless foreign aid is received. Wang estimated that in order to eliminate the共 Party and recover lost land, China will need 500 million US dollars annually in the next two or three years to balance the budget.

Minister Wang said that he hoped that the United States would provide assistance, but pointed out that China would prefer to obtain supplies rather than cash. "The sooner China obtains supplies, the sooner the Chinese共 Party will fail." Under the 125 million US dollar military assistance plan, China has only received "some transport aircraft" to date. When asked whether the CCP had received any foreign aid, Wang replied, "I am not sure, but I am sure they must have received some aid."

Wang answered questions that the prospects for China's recovery of trade and trade were improving, and that some barter trade had been concluded. Wang continued that he and other officials in the Far East were studying "the possibility of organizing an Asian alliance for economic and political security in accordance with the nature of the Western European Union. But it is aimed at obtaining assistance from the United States similar to the援　計劃. He continued that the details had not yet been decided, and the negotiations were still in the exploratory stage.

Wang said that the Chinese government is determined to maintain the currency system reform for the efficiency of balancing the budget and repaying foreign exchange, and is working hard to迷到 this goal. The Chinese people have responded well to this, and the results so far have been "very satisfactory." Wang Yunwu continued: "I can guarantee that the government has the determination to improve the situation." Wang listed the measures taken as: First, reviewing the old tax system; second, adopting new measures to effectively increase government revenue; One hundred and eleven, strictly saving government expenditures, and abolishing redundant personnel. "When prices stabilize and people's beliefs are restored, the situation can be improved." When asked whether he had read the report of the House Foreign Affairs Committee subcommittee on the activities of the共 Party in China, Wang replied that he had not had time to study the report, but that the report put forward a very accurate analysis, and he strongly agreed with the report's advocacy of strengthening aid to China.

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu arrived here in Washington today and will stay for two days before returning to China. Several receptions have been prepared. He is scheduled to speak at the American Far East Industrial and Commercial Committee on the 6th, and will also meet with some financial leaders here.

As for the institutions of provincial and county governments, they should not be rigidly stipulated to meet the needs of various places. Regarding rural reconstruction, it is believed that Chinese rural areas are suffering from poverty, and we must find ways to eliminate various natural and man-made disasters. Rural reconstruction work should pay attention to both technical and social reforms at the same time. The former aims at the widespread use of machinery, and the latter should start with the development of farmers' organizations.

### Curbing Panic Buying in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Hangzhou: Strict Investigation of Scalpers; Citizens of Yangzhou and Changshu Also Rush to Buy Goods; Beijing Implements Rationing Today

[Our Suzhou Office, 5th] Yesterday, due to scalpers from Shanghai coming to Suzhou to snap up goods, citizens became anxious and rushed to buy. The county government ordered the police to strictly investigate scalpers and immediately organized an inspection team to be stationed in central areas inside and outside the city to monitor street activity and prevent disturbances.

[Our Wuxi Office, 5th] Here, prices of all goods have risen to the 819 limit. The rush to buy in yarn shops in the Beidajie Jiangyin Lane area is particularly intense. To prevent scalpers, yarn businesses have established a temporary joint cotton yarn allocation office, effective immediately. The flour market has also stalled, with flour shops overcrowded with people queuing and jostling to buy, creating a seriously chaotic situation. Furthermore, jewelry stores have been closed for a long time and are unable to maintain operations, leading to the dismissal of staff. Fresh meat is available at a price but out of stock, while cooked meat remains available. At 9 AM today, the county government, together with the command post, formed a team to discuss the issue of increased taxes on tobacco and alcohol, deciding to sell alcohol and tobacco at the original price plus increased tax, and cigarettes at Shanghai prices.

[Our Hangzhou Office, 5th] Panic buying in Hangzhou is even more intense, with scalpers actively buying up woolen yarn and silk fabrics, causing these two industries to be in a state of near-standstill. Department stores are also hoarding goods and refusing to sell. Because the Hangzhou Yarn Factory allocates yarn at prices much lower than the black market, scalpers are even more rampant. Recognizing the market chaos, the inspection authorities conducted a full inspection on the 5th and detained scalpers.

[Our Jiangdu Office, 5th] After the adjustment of the cigarette tax, panic buying became intense due to the uncertainty of the new prices. Today, the county government, in order to prevent the expansion of the panic buying trend, ordered managers of stores to temporarily suspend business from noon to register their cigarette inventory within half a day. Simultaneously, the city defense department and pacification teams were invited to jointly verify the new prices for stored cigarettes, generally doubling the prices of all brands of cigarettes, to be sold at the new prices starting tomorrow. In addition, citizens have been rushing to buy cloth and general merchandise in recent days, with most shops closing as early as 6 PM, resulting in an unprecedentedly desolate evening market. The rice market is experiencing low trading volume due to limited supply. However, the market outside the city has become chaotic, and the authorities have increased their vigilance.

[Our Changshu Office, 5th] Due to uncertain supplies of silk fabrics, general merchandise, imported goods, and local products, residents are rushing to buy them, making it impossible for businesses to cope. They closed early today to avoid the rush. The market situation is gradually becoming chaotic, but fortunately, the authorities are maintaining order effectively, and no accidents have occurred.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] There has been panic buying in Beijing on the 5th. To prevent this, the municipal authorities have stipulated that, starting from the 6th, citizens purchasing (1) cotton cloth, (2) wool fabrics, (3) woolen yarn, (4) flour, and (5) rubber shoes must present their national identification cards, and there will be certain quantity limits. Purchases will be noted on the identification cards. Detailed measures will be announced by the municipal government on the 6th.

### Precious Artifacts at the Beijing Observatory Coveted and Sawn Off

### Material Exchange Between Urban and Rural Areas in North China

### Security Council Passes Resolution to Include Berlin Issue on Agenda: Soviet Representative Announces Non-Participation in Discussions

[Report from this newspaper] Paris Radio, 5th: The Security Council today, with nine votes to two, passed a resolution to discuss the Berlin issue. After the resolution was passed, Soviet representative Vyshinsky immediately requested to speak, stating that the Soviet Union would withdraw from this discussion. The Ukrainian representative expressed solidarity with the Soviet Union. Both representatives left the venue only after the chairman announced that the discussion would be postponed until tomorrow. Vyshinsky firmly denied that the Soviet Union had blockaded Berlin, saying that this was extreme propaganda and completely unfounded. He also accused the United Kingdom, the United States, and France of attempting to sabotage the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference. He believed that the Berlin issue should be discussed by the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in order to reach a peaceful solution. The Soviet representative stated that the Soviet Union absolutely supported the United Nations, but that the United Nations should currently focus on issues such as Indonesia, Palestine, and Greece, and hand over the Berlin issue to the Foreign Ministers Conference, as this issue was not within the scope of the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] According to well-informed sources here today, any mediation of the Berlin dispute by international figures such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations or Australian Foreign Minister Evatt is premature. At the same time, sources close to the Secretary-General of the United Nations confirmed that both Lie and Evatt would not want to lose the opportunity to intervene unless it was proven that such action would be effective. However, as of now, the development of the situation does not allow for the possibility of such an opportunity. According to Lie's opinion, the current consultation could be used for the future to facilitate the road to compromise between East and West. However, Lie believes that any initiation of mediation should come from the majority of delegations from the outside, especially the British delegation, who believe that this proposal can only be put forward when the situation becomes a real threat to peace.

[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] Although Vyshinsky hinted on the 4th that the Soviet Union would refuse to participate in any debate on the Berlin issue, Western representatives believe that this is just another bluff by the Soviet Union. A spokesman for the US delegation said, "We don't think they will walk out. The Soviet Union has been in the habit of intimidation and threats after the war, but intimidation and threats can never be the basis of policy."

### International Control of Atomic Energy Issue: Two Groups Engage in Verbal Warfare; Czechoslovakia Expresses Unwillingness for Uranium Mines to Be Controlled

[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] The United Nations Political Committee continued the atomic energy debate on the 5th. Canadian representative McNaughton challenged the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union seemed to have declared its willingness to accept the United States' atomic energy control plan as a basis for future discussions. He asked the Soviet Union to guarantee its promise. Czech representative Clementis condemned the U.S. plan as representing the saying of "atomic energy in common ownership", supporting the Soviet Union and calling on the West not to block the way to a solution. He mentioned the Czech uranium mine but said it was not important.

Australian representative Hodgson described the U.S. contribution to atomic energy as "epoch-making and unique", but opposed the Canadian proposal to temporarily end the United Nations' discussions with the Soviet Union on atomic energy control, which had been supported by the three powers. He said, "We must not give up any chance of reaching an agreement, because the consequences of failure would be truly appalling for mankind." The El Salvadoran representative attacked the Soviet Union for implying that it might possess atomic bombs, stating affirmatively that "she will not possess atomic weapons." The Belarusian representative Kyrylaǔ accused the U.S. of adopting a "big stick policy", saying that the so-called monopoly of atomic energy was "the biggest stick." Clementis declared that Czechoslovakia was unwilling to place its uranium mines under international control. His statement was quite important, as Czechoslovakia was the only uranium-producing country within the Soviet sphere of influence. He said that Czechoslovakia opposed international control of atomic energy development because "we have uranium mines, and under this plan, we must give up the uranium mines and hand them over to international institutions." Since 1945, the Soviet Union has controlled Czech mineral resources, prohibiting Czechs from operating mines under monopolistic lease agreements. Philippine representative Romulo said that the Soviet Union's new atomic energy proposal, if its meaning is as we understand it, is a ray of hope. He said that only the U.S. possessed atomic bombs in the world.

### "Strange" Explosion Occurs in the Soviet Union: Suspected to Be Atomic Test

### Soviet Union Devotes Efforts to Atomic Research

[Associated Press, London, 4th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 4th that Soviet physicist Vavilov had recently completed luminescent research in Leningrad that would help atomic research. In his new book, Vavilov pointed out that cold light or luminescence "has become a fundamental part of physics and an inseparable part of the structure theories of atoms, molecules, crystals, and liquids, which is helpful to the study of material structure by physicists and chemists, and its practical use has also greatly increased."

### Wartime Air Raid Shelters: Britain Stops Demolition

Recruitment Rally Disrupted by Communists

[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] The Home Office confirmed today that the British government has ordered local civil defense bureaus to stop demolishing air raid shelters.

It is also said that the government is considering plans to build deep air raid shelters in various places.

[Associated Press, London, 4th] Communist demonstrators attempted to disrupt armed forces recruitment rallies in London and Croydon on the 4th, but were dispersed by military police. At an outdoor rally in London, two people climbed onto the stage while Secretary of Defense Alexander was speaking, holding banners that read "Don't Fight for U.S. Dollars." They and ten others were arrested by the police. Although there were conflicts during the rally, there were no injuries.

### Governments of Five Western European Countries Officially Announce: Montgomery Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces; Commanders of Land, Air, and Naval Forces Appointed by British and French Generals Respectively; Agreement Reached on U.S. and Canada Participating in Joint Defense

[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] It is heard that after a two-hour meeting of the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France here on the afternoon of the 5th, a major decision has been made on the expansion of the Western European alliance defense plan to the Atlantic alliance, so that the United States and Canada can jointly participate.

[Central News Agency, London, 5th] The governments of the five Western European countries participating in the Brussels Treaty announced here last night the official candidates for the Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Allied Forces. As expected, Marshal Montgomery has been appointed as the permanent Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Allied Forces.

French General Tassigny has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Allied Land Forces, British Air Marshal Robb has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Allied Air Forces, and French Vice Admiral Chassaigne has been appointed Commander of the Western European Allied Naval Forces. It is noteworthy that the Naval Commander of the Western European Allied Forces does not use the title "Commander-in-Chief", as it is generally known that once a war breaks out, the British Navy will fight under the command of its national commander. Therefore, the Naval Commander of the Western European Allied Forces is actually only an advisor to the Western European Alliance. It is said that Marshal Montgomery is currently the Chief of Staff of the British Empire, and will resign from his current position when he takes up his new position. General Tassigny is currently the Inspector General of the French Army, Marshal Robb is currently the Commander-in-Chief of the British Air Force Fighter Command, and General Chassaigne is the Deputy Chief of Staff of the French Navy.

[Report from this newspaper] London Radio, 5th: Marshal Montgomery will resign from his position as Chief of Staff of the British Empire. The highest-ranking candidate to succeed him is Clutterbuck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] French Vice Admiral Chassaigne has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Navy, which has been well received by all sectors of the British Navy, as the main task of this position is to adjust the naval defenses of the European coastline, and France occupies most of the coastline. Naval circles also pointed out that Chassaigne will be known as the "Representative of the Western European Navy" and will focus on advising the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army and Air Force, and his staff is expected to include senior naval officers.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] The Chiefs of Staff of the Land, Sea, and Air Forces of the five signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty are scheduled to meet here tomorrow, with Lord Tedder, the British Air Force Chief of Staff, presiding.

### Special Envoy of Korea, Cho Pyong-ok, Visits Truman

Hoping the U.S. Will Continue Military and Economic Aid

[United States Information Service, Washington, D.C., 4th] Cho Pyong-ok, special representative of Korean President Syngman Rhee, met with President Truman today.

He also requested that the United States continue to be concerned about the well-being of Korea. Cho stated that the Korean people and their newly established democratically elected government in Seoul will continue to work toward the reunification of North and South Korea. However, he told Mr. Truman that Korea still needs military and economic aid to carry out its national plans.

### Berlin Air Corridor: Soviets Conduct Parachute Exercises; Britain Receives Notice and Protests

[United Press, Berlin, 5th] Soviet officials notified the Allied Air Safety Center on the 5th that they would be conducting parachute exercises in the air corridor 20 miles outside of Berlin. Details were not released. The Soviets only stated that the parachute exercises would be held in the corridor, between two Soviet airfields 25 miles apart, right on the edge of the British sector of Berlin. The British immediately protested, arguing that this action violated safety agreements. The Soviets stated that the parachutists would begin descending from 2,600 feet, which would clearly endanger British aircraft, as British planes usually fly below 2,000 feet.

### U.S. Bipartisan Foreign Policy Remains Consistent; Will Not Abandon Rights in Berlin; Vandenberg Warns Soviets Against Miscalculation

[United States Information Service, Washington, D.C., 4th] Republican Senator Vandenberg, a senior planner of foreign policy, delivered a radio address last night, praising America's bipartisan foreign policy, pointing out that this policy allows the nation to speak with greater unity and enables foreign policy to remain consistent. He explained the process by which government policy becomes bipartisan policy and reiterated his warning that "any idea that we are divided by disagreements on domestic issues and therefore vulnerable is a mistake." He described the Republican Party's contributions to the European Recovery Program, the aid to Greece and Turkey agreement, and the Rio de Janeiro Treaty, stating, "I want to reiterate that this is the most brilliant demonstration of bipartisan foreign policy." In dealing with diplomatic problems, our unity is as important as our atomic bomb. This unity is currently our best guarantee of peace. We oppose easily abandoning our rights in Berlin in the face of Soviet aggression. Abandoning these rights, as in the Munich Conference, would have endless implications. We condemn the Soviets for their hypocrisy in rejecting our peaceful proposals to lift the Berlin blockade.

[United Press, Washington, D.C., 4th] In his radio address, Vandenberg condemned the Truman administration for not adhering to bipartisan foreign policy in its dealings with China and Japan.

### U.S. Strengthens Aid to France

UNRRA Hastens its Closure

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 5th] According to Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Director Hoffman late on the 4th, the 45 billion francs allocated for France as part of U.S. aid will not be tied, as a preferential treatment for France. This sum will be used by France to purchase industrial equipment and rebuild merchant ships. Another 1.7 billion francs will be used for developing electricity. Hoffman continued, stating that whether or not to freeze the remaining half of the ECA's funds for France will depend on the progress of France's financial recovery and monetary stability.

[Central News Agency, Washington, D.C., 4th] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is currently hastening its closure. The council today approved a plan to immediately liquidate accounts and allocate unused assets to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The World Health Organization will receive one million U.S. dollars, which has already been allocated for the implementation of health programs and approved by the joint committee of the World Health Organization, so only a transfer on paper is needed. The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund will receive 11,679,500 dollars (non-U.S. currency, and mostly not convertible into U.S. dollars).

### Labor Strikes Spread in France

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] After 300,000 miners went on strike, causing the Queuille government a headache, it is reported that 200,000 civil servants across France stopped working today. However, the overall situation in the country remains calm on the surface. Rumors are circulating that a three-party coalition movement is underway in French political circles, allowing the Communist Party to rejoin the government. Some believe that this movement is the best way to prevent de Gaulle from coming to power. However, due to fears that this may adversely affect U.S. aid, even if such action is taken, its prospects are still fraught with obstacles.

### Burmese Insurgent Volunteers May Compromise with Government

### Soviets Designate Several Cities as Restricted Areas; Restrict Activities of U.S. Personnel; U.S. May Take Reciprocal Measures Against Soviet Diplomats

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 4th] The State Department announced today that the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union has received notification from the Soviet government that foreign journalists and foreign personnel are now prohibited from entering certain cities and regions of the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 4th] A State Department spokesman commented on the Soviet government's new measures prohibiting foreign journalists and diplomats from entering certain areas, saying that this is equivalent to prohibiting foreigners from visiting the entire Soviet Union except for the 50-kilometer radius around Moscow. Moreover, some areas within this 50-kilometer radius have also been designated as restricted areas. In theory, foreign journalists and others can still visit places that are not designated as restricted areas, but in order to go to any city, they must pass through these restricted areas, so in reality, it is equivalent to prohibiting travel throughout the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Washington, D.C., 5th] In light of the Soviet Union's increasing restrictions on American diplomats, the State Department is considering taking "reciprocal" measures against Soviet diplomats in the United States.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 4th] The State Department announced that former U.S. Consul in Vladivostok, Lyon, has departed for home with his wife and three consular staff members.

Japanese Bow Deeply and Shout "Banzai"

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Emperor Hirohito, accompanied by the Empress, visited a newspaper exhibition at a department store here this morning. The scene was more chaotic than ever before. Photographers and newsreel cameramen followed closely behind the Emperor and Empress, blocking their path and shouting loudly, ordering everyone to stay in place and not to move to avoid interfering with the photography. Hirohito squeezed through the crowd with difficulty, turning around with trouble, and the Empress was sweating profusely. Her maid constantly tiptoed and raised her hand to wipe the sweat from her forehead. The photographers rushed forward, giving the Emperor no "room to breathe." One Japanese newspaper fearfully said: "His Majesty will probably lose four or five pounds today." After the tour, the Emperor and Empress walked down the gray stone steps in front of the company's gate. A Japanese man shouted "Banzai" in the middle of the street. The company's Japanese employees all bowed deeply. The solemn and respectful scene at that time was in stark contrast to the scene inside. The heads of the newspapers also bowed to the ground when the Emperor summoned them. Today, under the flashing lights and loud shouts, the facial muscles of the Japanese man trembled, as if he was shocked. The royal attendants initially told foreign journalists that they were not allowed to shake hands with the Emperor, but all the journalists shook hands with him when they saw him.

### To Alleviate the Military and Economic Crisis in Greece: U.S. Aid Has Achieved Results; Truman Submits Report to Congress

[United Press, Washington, D.C., 5th] President Truman reported to Congress on the 5th that the "remarkable success" of U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey has provided security for the Middle East and greatly benefited world peace. In the first optimistic report on the issue of aid to Greece and Turkey, the President said that U.S. aid was provided "at a historically critical time in the struggle for peace." He stated that U.S. aid to Greece supported the right of free people to choose their own government and laid the foundation for their economic recovery. "Although the Communist agitation, sabotage, and defamation campaigns have intensified, these goals have clearly been achieved." "The remarkable success of this program has enabled the Greek people to overcome the military and economic crisis they faced. At the same time, supporting Turkey's decision to resist foreign pressure and maintain its independence has contributed significantly to consolidating this strategic region and benefiting world peace."

He stated that U.S. aid has enabled Greece to "overcome the serious threat to its independence" and saved its economy from collapse.

Truman's report concluded: During this period, the main task of the Economic Cooperation Administration was to strive to obtain consumer goods. In the future, attention should be paid to increasing Europe's export potential. Finally, the report emphasized that Marshall Plan recipient countries can purchase goods such as oil and meat from countries other than the United States and also stated that, as suggested by the House of Representatives, the dismantling of certain German factories should be halted.

### Premier Weng Cables Instructions to Inspector Chiang, Directing That No Taxes Be Added Except on Tobacco and Alcohol; Strictly Investigate Travelers' Limited Items for Export

[Our Dispatch] Premier Weng Wenhao personally made a long-distance phone call to Chiang Ching-kuo, who is in charge of commercial management in Shanghai, and gave two important instructions: (1) The central government has decided that except for items such as tobacco and alcohol that have already had taxes increased, no taxes will be added to any other items. (2) Starting today, outbound travelers in the city will be subject to increased inspection on land, sea, and air. The items carried will be limited to the necessities required by one person; any excess will be confiscated. The purpose of this measure is to prevent "single-band" smuggling of materials from the city. Furthermore, the management authorities believe that the current phenomenon of competitive purchasing of materials, although strictly restricted, does not hinder the overall situation. The spokesperson stated that as long as factories do not stop production and the supply of daily necessities is sufficient, the competitive purchasing of materials can be said to be an unnecessary worry. As for the rush to buy luxury goods, it is even more irrelevant to people's livelihood. Also, it is reported that Chiang Ching-kuo visited the Shenxin No. 9 Factory yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to conduct an on-site inspection and discuss the issue of raw material supply with the person in charge.

### Price of Foreign Cigarettes Approved to Increase; Temporarily Suspend Supply First; Handle Inventory Registration

[Our Dispatch] Bureau of Social Affairs Director Wu Kaixian convened a meeting yesterday afternoon with representatives from the Bureau of Commodity Supply, the Bureau of Commodity Tax, the Bureau of Finance, and cigarette manufacturers to discuss the issue of adjusting the price of foreign cigarettes after the increase in commodity tax. It was decided to handle the registration of foreign cigarette inventory and issue a notice to the associations instructing all cigarette shops to temporarily suspend the sale of foreign cigarettes before the price of foreign cigarettes is determined. In principle, the price of foreign cigarettes is permitted to increase in proportion to the price of domestic cigarettes, pending detailed verification.

It is reported that merchants in the city have registered 58,644 cases of foreign cigarettes with the Bureau of Commodity Tax, with 50,000 cigarettes per case. In addition, scattered strips and cigarettes stored by the Bureau of Commodity Supply are not included. Therefore, although the import of foreign cigarettes has been prohibited, the inventory and smuggled goods

The original ratio of the price of Lis cigarettes to the price of the domestic cigarettes was three to one. Now that the commodity tax on domestic cigarettes has increased, the price ratio has dropped to one to one. Wu Kaixian believes that if the price of foreign cigarettes is not increased, the cigarette factories in the city will be forced to close down, which will indirectly affect government tax revenue. The problem is serious, so it was decided to increase the price of foreign cigarettes in proportion. In addition to handling the registration of inventory, the Bureau of Commodity Supply was also asked to inform the number of inventory. In the future, the price of the bureau's sale will also be increased.

Unlicensed Foreign Cigarettes Will Be Banned

There are 52 types of foreign cigarettes sold in Shanghai and other parts of the country, including 3-5, Craven A, Morris, and Camel. All must be affixed with the Ministry of Finance's Cigarette Unified Tax Inspection Certificate for sale on the market, otherwise, they are private goods and should be banned. The Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Tax has received reliable confidential reports that cigarette paper shops and cigarette vendors are still secretly selling unlicensed foreign cigarettes. The bureau believes that the sale of these private foreign cigarettes is enough to prevent the three domestic cigarette products. It has been decided to dispatch personnel in the near future to carry out surprise spot checks. All private foreign cigarettes without an inspection certificate will be confiscated.

### Tricycle Prices Adopt Station System; Negotiated This Saturday

[Our Dispatch] Due to the lack of standards for bargaining for tricycles and rickshaws after the currency reform, citizens feel that they cannot afford it. The Bureau of Social Affairs decided to invite the police bureau, the public utilities bureau, and the labor and management of the industry to discuss the issue of restricting vehicle prices this Saturday (September 9). In principle, it is planned to divide the area, adopt a station system, assess the highest vehicle price between each section and station, and post it on each vehicle. The driver shall not bargain beyond this standard, otherwise, passengers can be sent to the police station for punishment. This method has been implemented in Hangzhou.

The driver's income is 10 yuan a day

After the currency reform, rickshaw drivers have a limited vehicle rental price, but citizens have an unlimited price for hiring. It is reported that rickshaw drivers now have a daily income of about 10 yuan in gold yuan, but the daily rental of a double rickshaw is only 1.15 million yuan in legal currency.

### Cai Zengxiang Visits Chiang Ching-kuo to Discuss Improving the Fish Market

### Coal Stored for Public Utilities Insufficient for Half a Month

Mayor and Others Telegraphically Request Allotment

[Our Dispatch] The coal stored for public utilities in the city is insufficient for half a month. Mayor Wu Yuzhang, together with Inspectors Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo, urgently telegraphed the central government, requesting that before the Coal Allocation Office is established (the establishment of the office was originally announced, but the business was shelved for some reason), the Fuel Management Committee should still be ordered to be responsible for the allocation work so as not to affect the business of public utilities. Furthermore, the municipal government has conducted a detailed investigation of the production situation in various coal-producing areas. If the coal allocation continues to be suspended, it will be submitted to the central government for approval to directly contact the coal merchants to purchase coal and transport it to Shanghai to maintain the city's public utilities.

### Zhu Shilong Concurrently Serves as Director of the Anthracite Coal Regulation and Supply Office

### Cotton Yarn Directly Distributed; Committee for Allocating Yarn to Be Established

[Our Dispatch] After the yarn and cloth market was ordered to close, Bureau of Social Affairs Director Wu Kaixian convened a meeting of representatives from various reproduction industry associations yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of direct distribution. It was decided that each industry and factory would organize a Yarn Allocation Committee to review the important quantity, which would be allocated by the Commodity Adjustment Committee. The candidates for the committee will be appointed after consultation between the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Commodity Regulation Committee. According to Director Wu, the target of cotton yarn supply is limited to three types: export, reproduction, and domestic sales. Export is to earn foreign exchange, so the allocation will be more. The products of the reproduction industry are not only supplied for sale in the city but also for domestic sales. In the future, artificial silk will also be managed in this way, specializing in supplying the reproduction industry.

### Residents' Association of Enemy and Puppet Houses Suggests Five Points for Government Adoption

[Our Dispatch] The Residents' Association of Enemy and Puppet Houses in the city hosted guests from all walks of life at the YMCA yesterday to conduct an open review of the government's sale of enemy and puppet real estate. More than 300 guests and resident representatives attended. Several suggestions were made at the meeting to provide the government with adoption. The methods are as follows: (1) According to the explanation of Chinese grammar, the so-called fee-paying users are tenants. Since the Central Trust Bureau has collected usage fees for this enemy and puppet house, it should be considered that the residents have legally obtained the right to lease. According to the provisions of the Civil Law, the transfer of property rights does not affect the lease right. No matter who buys it, the current residents should have the right to continue renting it. For rent, it may be adjusted reasonably. (2) The current residents have priority to purchase, and the valuation methods are: (a) The price of the house should be calculated based on the construction cost before the war, minus depreciation, and then converted into gold yuan. (b) The price of the base should be calculated according to the valuation of the Municipal Land Administration before August 19, and converted into gold yuan. (3) After the current residents have priority to purchase, the payment period should be extended as much as possible, with a minimum of two years. Add legal interest according to the purchase price and pay it in installments on a monthly basis to match the economic conditions of public school teachers and civil servants. (4) For those who are unable to purchase, the government should properly resettle them, so as not to make the current residents displaced and hinder public security. (5) Please refer to the precedents of China Textile Construction Company and other companies to issue government company shares, fill the war stocks and nationalize real estate companies by using enemy and puppet houses as assets, and then use it as a gold standard for circulation.

### Strictly Prohibit Stores from Closing Early; Two Police Precincts Ordered to Crack Down; Will Be Charged with Profiteering After Investigation

In the past two days, the city's various woolen, cloth, and page goods stores have closed early, citing poor sources of goods, which has had a profound impact on the psychology of the public. The Economic Brigade of the Police Bureau yesterday ordered the Huangpu and Lao Zha police precincts in the city's commercial center to strictly crack down on this unauthorized business closure. The goal is to ensure that businesses are opened as usual. If any stores still have the above-mentioned situation, they will be charged with profiteering and will not be tolerated. Yesterday, the Huangpu and Lao Zha police precincts summoned more than a dozen companies to the bureau, including the Huaxin Woolen Company on Henan Road, the Dalun Woolen Company, the Lao Jiuhe Silk and Satin Bureau on Nanjing Road, the Wanshengchang Silk and Cloth Shop, the Lao Jiefu, Hongmian, Zhongyuan, Lihua, Guohua Department Stores, and the Futai Chang Cloth Shop on Jinling East Road, Deshengxiang Cloth Shop, and Dadong Socks Factory Department Store, to inform them to open their business according to the order immediately and not to stop business without authorization.

### Merchants Request to Smooth the Source of Goods

The rapid trend of panic buying has affected department stores in this city. The Commercial Guild of the Department Store Industry specially dispatched seven representatives, including Ye Fukang, Zhou Zhihong, and Sheng Xiangsun, to visit Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon, requesting him to find ways to smooth the source of goods. Zhang Chude, the chief of the Price Management Section, received them on behalf of the director and promised to forward the request to Director Wu for handling. According to Director Wu's interview with reporters, the Social Affairs Bureau is already paying attention to the panic buying in department stores and will take necessary measures. For essential clothing items such as shirts, towels, and socks, it is planned to adopt the sales method used for cotton cloth and wool. Each citizen must present their ID card to purchase the above items. However, the quantity and timing of each citizen's purchase will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau in consultation with the relevant trade association before public implementation.

### Restrictions Also Placed on Purchase of Silk and Satin

[Our Newspaper] To curb the bad trend of panic buying, in addition to restricting the purchase of wool, woolen fabric, and cotton cloth based on the city's national ID card, it has been learned that silk and satin purchases have also been restricted to one piece of robe fabric and one set of Qi Shan pants fabric per person every six months.

### Many Tourists, "Dan Bang" Active: Traffic Volume on Two Lines Reaches Saturation Point

[Our Newspaper] Autumn is typically a travel season, coupled with the activity of "dan bang" (porters), resulting in extremely congested passenger traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Express trains like the Feikuai, Kaixuan, Jinling, Qiantang, and Xihu are filled with high-ranking officials, wealthy merchants, and autumn tourists, while other passenger trains are crowded with ordinary people struggling to make a living. According to statistics from the railway bureau, the average daily passenger volume at the city's North Station has increased from 90,000 to 120,000 in the past week. This number has reached the saturation point of transportation capacity, so the number of trains cannot be increased, and the carrying capacity is already at its limit. Other trains, such as the 5th and 17th trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line, are particularly crowded due to their convenient departure times. Passengers often risk their lives to climb onto the roofs of the cars. The railway bureau believes that this excessive crowding phenomenon will return to normal after the comprehensive control of goods.

### Inspection of Materials in Shanghai Area: General Headquarters Established

[Our Newspaper] The city-wide inspection of materials is about to begin. The police department was ordered to establish the Shanghai District Materials Inspection General Headquarters yesterday, with Yu Shuping as the general commander and Gu Bingyuan, He Longqing, Cai Ren, Wang , and Wang Zhaohuai as deputy commanders. The headquarters has three groups: supervision, liaison, and general affairs. The headquarters is temporarily located in the conference room on the eighth floor of the Police Headquarters on Fuzhou Road. The "Inspection Guidelines" for all staff have been rushed into print by the police department and are expected to be distributed to all units today. The guidelines remind inspectors to be thorough, strict, amiable, and serious when performing their duties and not to accept any hospitality. At the same time, the two categories of paper and industrial raw materials among the seven daily necessities refer to nine types: rough-edged paper, newsprint, cotton, gasoline, diesel, coal, caustic soda, rubber, and pigments. During inspections, in addition to presenting their work permits, they should also be accompanied by local Baojia chiefs. If any of the seven items are found to be unregistered, lack purchase invoices, or exceed the legal quantity, they will be confiscated and the owner will be required to provide a guarantee for safekeeping pending verification.

### Distribution of Surplus Materials to be Implemented Starting Next Saturday

The distribution of surplus materials to public and educational personnel organized by the Materials Supply Bureau will be implemented simultaneously at the bureau's retail department and designated sales stores next Saturday.

### Riot Case at Shenxin No. 9 Factory: Trial of 37 Defendants Concluded; Secret Trial Claims No Political Influence

[Our Newspaper] Yang Guangming and 37 other workers from the Shenxin No. 9 Factory at 140 Macau Road were suspected of inciting strikes and riots on February 2nd of this year. The Special Criminal Court filed a public prosecution against them on charges of endangering the state. Yesterday, the court presented the 37 defendants in custody for a full-day trial, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 12th of this month.

The 37 defendants in custody, including Yang Guangming, were brought in from the detention center of the Penglai Police Sub-bureau around 8:00 AM. They were all disheveled and listless. At around 9:00 AM, Presiding Judge Sun Bin and two judges opened a collegiate court for trial. The defendants' defense lawyers were not allowed to appear in court to defend them, and anyone was forbidden from attending. The trial lasted for a long time, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to around 6:00 PM, and the entire process was kept secret. Afterwards, it was learned that the content of the interrogation included three points: (1) whether any of the defendants had participated in the Communist Party; (2) whether they had instigated the mass strike on February 2nd; and (3) whether they had fought with the military and police or assisted in the event. The defendants all denied having participated in the Communist Party and denied having instigated the strike or assisting in the event. They claimed that the cause of the labor unrest was the request to the management for a two-month loan of wages, payment of cost-of-living discounts, distribution of allocated goods, and allocated rice. Because the management showed no sincerity and delayed in responding, it aroused public anger and led to a work slowdown. There was no political influence involved. However, Judge Sun pointed out that when they raised the conditions, they did not first request mediation from the Social Affairs Bureau, but rather had a conflict with the management, which was obviously a violation of the law. Subsequently, the court questioned in detail the situation of the disturbance and the confrontation with the military and police. The defendants, who had been in custody for more than eight months, mostly suffered from serious illnesses and requested bail. Judge Sun stated that as the verdict was imminent, the request was denied.

### National Aviation Enterprise Not Considering Price Increase

### Case of Paper Hoarding in a Car Repair Shop: Further Trial Pending Examination of Account Books

[Our Newspaper] The owner of a car repair shop at 333 Tongfu Road was previously discovered to have hoarded a large quantity of paper of various colors. The owner, Ba Jianfei, was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for violating the Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations. Judge Wu Shaochang of the District Court opened a trial yesterday morning. Ba, accompanied by a lawyer, argued in court that he owned the Dehe Paper Shop at 9, Lane 360, Beijing East Road. All the inventory was originally at 149 Wujiang Road. Later, because the place was inhabited and the rooms were small, it was moved to the car repair shop on Tongfu Road, and it was not the case that both places had inventory. He also stated that according to the regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau, only newsprint needed to be registered. The newsprint owned by the defendant was only two reams, which was not enough to constitute hoarding. The registration deadline was September 29th, and the defendant was arrested before the deadline, so it could not be regarded as a violation of the law. According to the testimony in court, it was ordered that the defendant's account books be examined, and the trial was adjourned until the 14th.

### Accused of Colluding to Claim Foreign Exchange Beyond the Limit: Ouyang Ming Indicted

[Our Newspaper] Chen Yongyan, a local resident, previously forged the seal of the Jinhua County Chamber of Commerce in the name of the person in charge of the Jinhua Wujiang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in order to fraudulently obtain foreign exchange. He applied to the Import and Export Management Committee to participate in the quota distribution for the third quarter of the previous year and was allocated a foreign exchange quota of HK$29,310. Because there was no co-signing applicant, Ouyang Ming (Ouyang Minggang), the manager of the Shanghai Xiehe Enterprise Company, was responsible for receiving and transferring the goods, settling the exchange in legal tender, and annotating "Received and transferred by Xiehe Enterprise Company" in pencil on the duplicate of the exchange settlement permit. This matter was discovered by the Export Management Committee, which sent a letter to the District Procuratorate for investigation. After the investigation was completed, in addition to the prosecution of Chen Yongyan, Ouyang Ming was also prosecuted on charges of forging documents.

### Compensation Machine Prices Halved: Manufacturers Paying and Taking Delivery

More than 1,600 Japanese compensation machines allocated to private enterprises have been shipped to Shanghai for more than half a year. Because private manufacturers believe that the stipulated selling price is too high and are unwilling to accept them, the handling work has been greatly frustrated. In order to distribute them as soon as possible and avoid damage, the government recently decided to reduce the original selling price by half. Manufacturers are generally satisfied. Therefore, more than a dozen manufacturers have recently paid the Central Bank and contacted the Shanghai Office of the Industry and Commerce Department's Japanese Compensation Materials Processing Committee to take delivery of the goods. The long-delayed processing work can be completed in the short term.

### The Only Executive Agency for Economic Control Work: Expanded Organization of the Operations Brigade; All Members Receive Special Training; Remarkable Achievements Shortly After Establishment

[Our Newspaper] In recent months, the city's economic control work has attracted nationwide attention. Under the command of the economic control supervisors, the police department's Economic Police Brigade is the only executive agency and the vanguard for exerting the effectiveness of economic control. According to statistics from the brigade, they handled more than 1,600 economic control cases in September alone. Notable cases such as those involving Lin Wang Company, Hu Xinyi, Wei Boxiang, Rong Hongyuan, and Zhan Peilin are well known to the public. The regular work of the agency is to monitor the market, day and night, which is extremely difficult. In addition to effectively controlling the market's telecommunications and telephones, it is also necessary to secretly deploy informants and collect intelligence at any time. Its work is different from the criminal police's emphasis on post-event investigation. Instead, it conducts thorough reconnaissance before the crime is revealed. Once the opportunity is ripe, it takes action, and its actions often occur at the moment when the transaction is in progress. Therefore, all members of the brigade have received special training, and it is difficult to complete the task without meticulous attention to detail. For example, the warehouse inspection work, which involved the deployment of all members of the team, has been implemented for nearly three months, laying the most practical foundation for economic control work. During the process, investigation, identification, review, and inquiry are intertwined, and the effort has been fruitful. As another example, Wei Boxiang was engaged in large-scale black market gold and foreign currency trading in the city. The team had been investigating him for a long time. In order to obtain solid evidence, they spent more than 15 days specifically recording Wei's external phone calls and his personal actions, without slacking off for 24 hours a day. Therefore, the resulting record alone was voluminous. Wei himself was unusually alert. Usually, when there were transactions or phone calls, he used codewords and evasive language, which was extremely difficult to grasp. On the night of his arrest, he took a package and went to a certain place by pedicab. Based on the facts obtained from previous investigations, the team determined that the time was ripe, so they raided and arrested him, and found that he was in the process of transacting. The enormity of its work can be imagined.

Originated from the Economic Supervision Group

Currently, the general public's concern for the team is increasing day by day, and the team's activities over the past year have become the subject of conversation among the public. In fact, the team's history is very short, less than a year so far. Its embryonic organization was the Economic Supervision Group, which was jointly established by the relevant bureaus of the municipal government and the investigation department of the garrison headquarters in August 1947. At that time, under the command of the group, the police department had a gold and foreign currency group, which was uniformly commanded by Xuan Tiewu. In November, the group was revoked, and the police department added an economic section under the administrative office and reorganized the Economic Police Brigade, which was headed by Xu Youzuo. In February of this year, the Economic Police Team was merged into the Economic Section and was taken over by Cao Maoliang. The section established gold and foreign currency, daily necessities, and fuel units, and the original members of the team were assigned to serve in various units. In March, due to the heavy workload, the section and team were reorganized, and the Economic Police Team was reorganized again. At this time, the current Cheng Yikuan took over the team's duties.

Brief Biography of Team Leader Cheng Yikuan

It has been rumored that Cheng was initially recommended by Chiang Ching-kuo to Shanghai and that everything was arranged in advance. Cheng has denied this. After graduating from Soochow University, he studied at the New Jersey State Police Academy in the United States and the British Criminal Police Academy. He returned to China at the end of 1947. He first worked in the foreign affairs section of the camp bureau, then was transferred to the position of Deputy Chief of the Sisheng Sub-bureau, and then to the position of Captain of the Economic Police Brigade. He said that his experience was somewhat different from the various speculations outside.

In June of this year, the police department, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, specially established the Special Criminal Office, which was headed by Deputy Director Zhang Shi. The Economic Section and Economic Police Brigade, which were originally under the Administrative Office, were transferred to the office. In order to improve the level of economic police, the original number of 70 people was reorganized into a state name, and Yin Zhenming, the Deputy Chief of the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau, was transferred as the Deputy Captain, and Wang Sizu was appointed as the Action Group Leader. After August 19, Chiang Ching-kuo came to Shanghai and ordered the police department to make economic control execution work the focus of the team's mission and transferred the Kanjian First Squadron led by Li Nianzi to be mixed and organized with it.

Will Recruit 100 University Students

Recently, because 50 students borrowed from various universities during the summer vacation have returned to school one after another, the team felt that there were not enough people and will recruit 100 university graduates to participate in the work. Currently, in order to strengthen the team's execution of the inspection of special materials leaving the country, seven land and water inspection teams will be established, composed of the team, the Kanjian Brigade, military police, and police officers from various district police stations. At the same time, the police department has also issued a notice to all police stations to establish economic control groups, with the chiefs of the stations as the group leaders, to regularly contact the team to handle general economic control work. The team itself has also expanded its organization, determining four groups: reporting, action, intelligence, and surveillance. In addition to the four group leaders, there are also 14 squad leaders, and it is stipulated that the squad leaders will lead the team during duty, wearing plain clothes, wearing yellow armbands, and carrying work permits. In addition, an "Economic Inspection Manual" has been compiled and printed, detailing the main points of various duties. It is expected that in the future, economic control work will be carried out more effectively under a strict and proper arrangement.

### Launching a Thrift and Diligence Campaign: Organizing the Shanghai Branch of the Vigorous Implementation Association; Responsible Persons for Preparation Appointed

In order to launch a thrift and diligence campaign, people from all walks of life in the city held the second thrift and diligence movement symposium at the Military Friends Society on Zha Pu Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to exchange opinions. Fang Zhi presided over the meeting. Fang first stood up and said that the promotion of the thrift and diligence movement is to change the social habits of extravagance and debauchery and establish a style of diligence and thrift. The launch of this movement is of great significance in awakening wealthy people. He hoped that the attendees would speak enthusiastically and provide valuable opinions. Then Zhang Yi spoke, saying that the thrift and diligence movement is to establish a good atmosphere and is a spiritual sanction against extravagant people. He hoped that the people leading this movement would have the greatest courage to transform a rational atmosphere. He also proposed that "diligence" should be maintained permanently without violating human relationships and within reason, and "thrift" should strive for simplicity in customs and habits to make life rational. Qin Runqing said that thrift and diligence should be practiced by example to enable the movement to be expanded and promoted. Wang Guanqing advocated striving for economy in clothing and food, increasing production, and promoting healthy entertainment. Qiu Xisheng hoped that guests would be served with plain boiled water in the name of thrift and diligence, and that no refreshments would be served at tea parties to create a new atmosphere. Fan Zhengbo hoped that the thrift and diligence movement would be thorough and avoid becoming formalistic. Xu Mingya advocated promoting the movement through organization and using moral persuasion. Finally, it was passed: (1) Luo Dunwei proposed to organize the Shanghai Branch of the Thrift and Diligence National Building Vigorous Implementation Association and appointed Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Yi, Zhu Jingnong, Fan Zhengbo, Xu Jiyin, Wu Yunxu, Xie Renzhao, Luo Dunwei, and others to be responsible for preparation. (2) The Military Friends Society is now jointly presided over by all sectors of the party, government, and military. The equipment is also very consistent with the principle of frugality, so the society is designated as a demonstration institution for the "Thrift and Diligence Movement." The preparatory office is temporarily located in the society. The tea party adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

### Great Fire at Yangjiadu, Pudong: Carelessness at Hongfeng Factory Workshop Causes Fire, Destroying Over Two Hundred Shanties; Firefighter Injured, Infant Drowned

[Our Report] A fire broke out at approximately 1:45 PM yesterday in room number two of the male workers' dormitory of Hongfeng First Yarn Factory in Nantao Nitang, Yangjiadu, Pudong, due to a worker, Ju Lianchen, privately and carelessly tapping into the electrical wires. The Pudong Fire Brigade rushed to the scene upon receiving the report. Simultaneously, fire brigades from the Yangjing District, the Shanghai South District, and the Customs Fire Department also arrived in vehicles to assist. During the height of the fire, Liu Zhongrong, a firefighter from the Pudong Fire Brigade, fell from the roof, injuring his hip. He was subsequently rushed to the hospital for treatment. Due to the strong winds, the fire was not extinguished until around 5:30 PM, having consumed sixteen male workers' dormitories and over two hundred nearby shanties. Residents of the shanties fled in panic, carrying the elderly and children, a truly chaotic scene. In one shanty, a woman who had just given birth to an infant the previous night was forced to flee hastily, carrying the baby. Amidst the crush, while crossing a small bridge, they were pushed and jostled by the crowd, and the infant fell into the river and drowned.

### US West Coast Seamen's Strike Affects Pacific Shipping

[Our Report] The strike by US West Coast seamen, which began on September 2nd, has now lasted for over a month with no prospect of resumption.

### Song Ziwen Reflects on His Year in Guangdong

— Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong

[Our Report from Guangzhou, 4th (by airmail)] October 3rd marked the first anniversary of Song Ziwen's administration in Guangdong. The day before, Song held a grand press conference, expressing many meaningful thoughts. This was the fifth time reporters had seen Chairman Song in a year, and the first time they had heard his hearty laughter.

On a rainy afternoon, the conference hall of the provincial government was filled with reporters waiting for news. At 3:00 PM, Chairman Song strode in, the buttons on his short-sleeved Hong Kong shirt still undone. He nodded continuously to the reporters, his smile unwavering for the two hours. It was easy to imagine a spring-like atmosphere in the autumn of South China from his tanned and determined face.

Welcoming Criticism as a Good Thing

The solemn provincial government conference hall rarely sees such a relaxed scene. As soon as Chairman Song opened his mouth, asking, "What guidance do you all have?" the reporters immediately fired off an interesting question: "Chairman Song, what are your thoughts on your year in Guangdong? What is the most pleasant thing you feel?" He seemed hesitant about this broad and specific question, taking a deep drag on his cigarette before replying in a half-joking tone: "My thoughts cannot be considered thoughts. The thoughts of you reporters truly represent the thoughts of the people of Guangdong, so I will say less. As for the most pleasant thing for me personally in the past year, it is the arbitrary attacks on me personally by a portion of people in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places who are unaware of the truth. If there were no attacks from them, it would show that I had not done anything, so it would not arouse their interest in reacting. Probably because the things I have done have progressed and have some achievements, it has aroused the attacks of this small group of people who are unaware of the overall situation. So, my first happy thing in my year in Guangdong is this." This unexpected "happy thing" caused a roar of laughter. After that, Chairman Song continued to review the gains and losses of military and political measures with a frank attitude.

Security Situation Worthy of Comfort

Regarding the suppression of bandits, Song first explained that the security in Guangdong province in the past year has greatly improved compared to before, which is the most comforting thing for him personally. The National Army stationed in the province has been mostly transferred elsewhere due to military needs over the years. However, since the successful organization of fifteen security and defense groups throughout the province, they are more than enough to replace the power of the National Army. After a year of suppression, the bandits that were rampant years ago have all been silenced. For example, the transportation lines in the Guangdong-Jiangxi border area, northern Guangdong, and the Pearl River Delta, which were the most severely affected by banditry, are now all unimpeded. However, he admitted that "suppressing bandits is easy, but eradicating bandits is difficult," so the main military work in the future will be to organize and train local armed forces to strengthen self-defense capabilities, so as to ensure that banditry cannot be revived. As for the rumors that the security situation in South China is "unimaginable," Song specifically stated in a firm tone that he "absolutely does not admit it!"

Careful Selection of Talent, Progress in Officialdom

Next, talking about the issue of officialdom, Song first said with emotion: "The corruption of Guangdong's officialdom did not begin today, but when you (referring to the reporters) were still children." Decades of habit have been formed, and it is indeed difficult to change this accumulated malpractice. For example, "It is necessary to find good people, but 'good people' and 'bad people' certainly do not have signs engraved on their foreheads. It is really not easy to find more than a hundred good county magistrates." However, he will never be discouraged because of this, and said that as a result of careful selection of talent since his arrival, it has been proven that the atmosphere of officialdom has greatly changed. The rumors that "several million Hong Kong dollars can buy a parent official" will not only no longer be heard in the future, but will also disappear forever.

Construction Funds Raised by the Province

In terms of provincial government finances, the income of current provincial-run enterprises has doubled compared to a year ago. Provincial construction projects, such as dike engineering, increasing police security forces, the Wengjiang Yongli construction project, the construction of the Nanling Railway branch line, and the Maipu port construction, all require funds that are raised by the province, without requiring the people to increase their tax burden by a single cent. Speaking of this, Song said with a pleasant tone: "Only this point is considered to be the most worthy of my hometown," and expressed that he will step up construction in the future to achieve success. After the financial expenditure improves, the first step will be to increase the salaries of civil servants.

Eliminating Bad Habits, China Can Be Saved

Finally, talking about the most criticized price issue recently, some people said that when he was not here, Guangzhou's prices were only the second or third highest in the country. When he came, Guangzhou's prices jumped to the top of the country. He believes that this is just an excuse for "professional attackers" and is not worth pursuing. In particular, regarding the recently noisy issue of "unnamed figures in Guangdong embezzling military funds," he specifically asked Du Meihe, the general manager of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, to report in detail again on the matter of the Guangdong Provincial Bank purchasing more than 590,000 yuan in Hong Kong dollars to buy Siamese rice for disaster relief, and said with emotion: "There is an old saying in China called 'Protecting oneself with wisdom,' so most officials do not seek merit, but only seek no mistakes." Today, it has been further advanced to "the more you do, the more mistakes you make; the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make; and it is better not to do anything." The so-called "no one scolds for dividing the spoils, but someone scolds for doing things." If this kind of bad habit in the officialdom is not broken, China will definitely be incurable. Therefore, if you don't do things, it's fine, but if you do things, you must fight to the end with these people with conscience and blood. One

Finally, talking about national affairs, he said very clearly: Not long ago, he did go to Hong Kong and "advise Li Jishen as an old friend and old colleague not to be used by the Communist Party and do things that betray the country." "But whether he listens or not is up to him!"

### Chao County People's View of Feng Yuxiang

— Our Reporter Bao Baiping

[Our Report from Chao County, 1st] Feng Yuxiang, known to the world as a "rebel general" and a "Christian general," is like a precious ornament in a poor family's house in the eyes of the people of his hometown of Chao County, which does not help the poor life. Feng Yuxiang was born and rose to prominence in North China and has never had a deep relationship with Chao County. Very few, almost none, of the people of Chao County have risen in status by relying on him. The people of Chao County only see him as a "figure" and regard him as an ornament for the county, and nothing more.

However, his name has always been loud. Even women and children know that "a Feng Yuxiang came from our county"! In June of this year, he sent a letter from the United States to Chao County saying that it was hot in New York, where he lived, and that he was going to the countryside to escape the heat. After that, no one knew where he went. There are too many rumors: to Europe, to Hong Kong, and even that he will return to the "liberated areas" of China. His whereabouts have become a mystery. The people of his hometown are counting his life and sighing for him.

On September 6, newspapers published the news of his death, saying that he was burned to death on a ship traveling to the Soviet Union. This figure, who had dominated the political scene in China for forty years and played the protagonist in many tragedies, ended his sixty-seven-year life with a tragic fate. The news of his death came quite suddenly. When the reporter arrived in Chao County, some people were still half-believing.

Zhuke Village

Going north from the North Gate of Chao County along the Hechao Highway for more than twenty li, the hilly terrain makes the highway undulating. After the car climbs up a larger slope, you will see a village located on the right side of the slope. No more than forty small tile and thatched houses are scattered haphazardly among the fields. This is the original home of Feng Yuxiang—Zhuke Village under Caoxieling, Xiage Township, Chao County.

It is unknown in what era the Feng family lived in this village. Like ordinary farmers, they worked at sunrise and rested at sunset, spending their years in the fields. Because the place is desolate and the land is barren, farmers are lucky to be able to eat their fill after a year of hard work. Most people struggle on the brink of starvation. Even today, although this poor village has produced the figure of Feng Yuxiang, it is still dilapidated and desolate, and no different from the general economically bankrupt rural areas. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese knew that this was Feng Yuxiang's old home and doubled their destruction. The two tile houses where the Feng family had lived for dozens of days no longer exist. Even the families in the village who were not surnamed Feng suffered the disasters of being in the wrong place. It has become a dilapidated village.

Returning Home in Glory

In the seventh year of Guangxu, Feng was born in Xingji Town, Qing County, Hebei. His childhood was entirely in Baoding. In February of the 26th year of the Republic of China, when he was the Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, he returned to his hometown of Chao County. Returning home in glory was most appropriate for him. Feng Jishan, whose family was cramped in a room in Kanggezhuang, Baoding, and who had no food for the night, would never have thought that he would have today? He stayed in his hometown for two weeks for the first time and went to Beijing. In March of the same year, he returned to his hometown again and stayed until the end of April. During these dozens of days, he lived in Zhuke Village.

When he was in his hometown, he brought one million pine trees, as well as locust trees and Feicheng peach trees. He mobilized the nearby farmers to plant trees. Now, ten years later, the pine trees on Caoxieling are lush and have become a forest. But the owner of the trees has become ashes in a foreign land. If he knew in death, he would regret not seeing this because he took the wrong step.

He also brought his method of leading troops to the countryside. He liked to give small favors. He organized a Respect for the Elderly Association. All people over the age of fifty within five miles of the area received his small favors. He invited them to eat and drink, gave them coarse cloth, and explained how to raise chickens and ducks. These were all things that the people in the countryside regarded as honorable and were grateful for, but they were not aware of Feng's merits and crimes to the country.

When the east was just white, this noble person who had returned to his hometown got up. A set of blue coarse cloth short shirt and pants, matched with cloth shoes and cloth socks. It was really hard to imagine that he was the Deputy Chairman. He knocked on doors from house to house. Anyone who had not yet gotten up, he scolded for laziness at the door in the tone of instructing soldiers. When walking, he would go down to the fields to help with cultivation. No matter who asked to see him, he would talk about the history of feeding livestock, and finally politely say a few words: "I am a small person and can only talk about small things." In Feng's own mind, he had not made this trip in vain.

This was the first time he had returned to his hometown in his life, and it was also the last time.

Decline of the Feng Family

Feng's father, Feng Youmao, was originally a mud craftsman in Zhuke Village. There were four brothers. Feng Youmao was the second oldest. The oldest died very early and has no descendants. The third oldest was a tailor, and the fourth oldest was a tenant farmer. The family was poor, and they had always lived separately. During the Hong Yang Revolution, Feng Youmao had no permanent property and ran very far when he fled. He married a woman surnamed You in Jining, Shandong. He had seven children. According to Feng's "My Life": "The brothers were malnourished and five died." The only remaining ones were his eldest brother Feng Jidao (Hao Zhizhai) and himself. It is said that Feng Jidao is now over seventy and lives in Beiping. The original wife had two sons, both of whom have passed away. The second wife also had two sons. Feng Jidao is living a very poor life with his two sons and one grandson and has not returned south for many years.

Feng's original wife was surnamed Liu. The eldest son, Hongguo, is now forty-three years old and is a soldier like his father. Before Feng left the country in the 35th year, the highest authorities specially allowed him to enter the Army University. It is said that he is still in Chongqing. When he entered the Army University, he was only the father of one child. The second son, Hongzhi, went to the United States to study mechanics in the 34th year. He married an overseas Chinese daughter in the United States two years ago. He has not yet completed his studies. The two daughters are married in the north. No one in Chao County knows what the situation is like. Li Dequan is the second wife and has three daughters and one son. The eldest daughter, Lida, was buried in the fire pit with Feng this time. The others all went to the United States with Feng.

There are now about ten Feng surnames in Zhuke Village. In addition to the descendants of the third and fourth houses, the rest are Feng's distant relatives. Everyone wears straw sandals and plows the spring and summer under Caoxieling, regardless of the cold and heat. The Feng family in Zhuke Village is quite declining.

The Mansion is Lonely

On the 26th, on a gloomy morning, the reporter found the Feng Mansion, which was most loudly advertised, at the Xiaodong Gate of Chao County. This mansion faces east and west, with high walls and black doors, which is rare in this small place. Walking into the gate, there is a large courtyard. Everything has been newly repaired and painted. The three main rooms in the middle are large enough to accommodate forty or fifty guests. The floor is shiny and can be used as a family ballroom. However, many Western-style furniture and even sofas are piled up inside, indicating that the owner has not moved in. The whole thing is immersed in loneliness, as if mourning for the owner who died in a foreign land.

In the living room on the north side of the courtyard, I found Mr. Wang Qunxian, the temporary owner of the mansion. He is the son-in-law of Feng's cousin Zhuchu and served as an adjutant by Feng's side for many years. I thanked him for his cordial reception and told me the origin of this house.

In May of the 35th year, Feng returned to the capital after his rehabilitation. The ship passed through Wuhu. He ordered Mr. Wang to return to Chao to see if there was a place to live. Mr. Wang reported that in the dilapidated Chao County, there was a serious housing shortage and there was no place to live for a while. Feng decided to buy a house. This was the first time he had purchased property in his hometown. Mr. Wang returned to Chao and quickly bought the Ge family's house. The value at the time was 8.5 million yuan, with a total of twenty-three rooms. There was also a piece of open space behind the house. It was repaired last spring and is now managed by Mr. Wang.

Twelve years ago, Feng knew that Zhang Zhizhong had established a school in Huanglu, his hometown. He also set up Tuanshan School near Zhuke Village, planning to establish a school from elementary school to middle school. It was destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery fire shortly after its establishment. After the victory, preparations were made to re-establish the school. After buying the house, he bought 300 acres of land near his old home and said it would be used as a school fund, but the school has never been restored, and I am afraid it will never be restored in the future.

Mr. Wang said that since receiving Feng's letter in June to go to the countryside to escape the summer heat, he has not received any more letters. Mrs. Li Dequan has not received any telegrams either. Except for the news in the newspaper, he and ordinary people do not know anything else.

Definite Conclusion

Mr. Pan Zongpeng, Speaker of the Chao County Council, graduated from the third term of Baoding. He and Feng had the elegance of classmates. When the reporter asked him about his views on Feng, he pondered for a long time. He said that standing in the position of a fellow villager, it seemed that he should not criticize him after his death, but he had never agreed with his way of doing things. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, when Feng was the commander of the Sixteenth Mixed Brigade, he met him in Liujiamiao, Hankou, and he instinctively felt that his military management was hypocritical. In the seventeenth year, the Ministry of Military Affairs was established. Feng was the Minister. Zhang Zhizhong was originally scheduled to be the Director of the Army Department, but Zhang resigned forcefully because of Feng's volatility and unwillingness to work with him. He also revealed a privacy of Feng's. He said that when Feng was in Baoding, he expressed special affection for his original wife, but suddenly one night, his wife died without any illness. It is said that Feng killed her.

When the reporter visited an old man of seventy years old (he did not want to reveal his name), he denied everything about Feng. He said that a person who came from the army knew more than enough about the psychology of soldiers, but it was not possible to truly shoulder the important responsibilities of the country. Feng Yuxiang's childhood name was called "Ke Bao," and his original name was "Ji Shan." The three words "Feng Yuxiang" were temporarily given to him by a leader when he first joined the army. Looking at his life deeds, he often took temporary opportunities and tricks. It is not glorious to have such a figure in Chao County, standing from the country's position.

### Five Measures to Prevent Attacks by Traitorous Bandits in Wuxing

[Our Report from Wuxing, 2nd] The county's security authorities recently issued a provincial order, stating that police stations and township offices in various townships and towns are lax in prevention, and incidents of being attacked by bandits and having weapons confiscated occur from time to time. To prevent this, five precautions have been specified and ordered to be followed: (1) All firearms for people's self-defense must be registered within a time limit and must not be concealed. The local government will uniformly deploy them. (2) The police team will strictly implement joint guarantee and collective responsibility. In areas with serious banditry, joint patrols will be implemented, and sentry posts will be set up at key passes for inspection. (3) Police officers and soldiers should not carry firearms when going to townships for official business unless necessary. (4) If any county has a banditry incident, regardless of whether it is a public or private gun, the situation must be reported within five days. (5) Townships and towns that have not lost any guns within three months of being disturbed by bandits will be commended to the township heads, otherwise, they will be given a demerit.

### From Guimenguan in Southwest Changchun, Stranded Refugees Face the Calamity of Dying Like Decorations

— Jiang Yuyang

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 1st] Changchun, like a lone island battered by waves, stands firm. Since the sudden influx of over ten thousand refugees evacuated from Jilin, the population has surged. The city has no farmland for cultivation and lacks a route for grain supply. Fuel has been cut off since the end of last year, with minimal reserves left. Generating electricity is, of course, impossible; there is no light at night, and no means of transportation. The people struggle to survive with difficulty. Since May 24th, the Communist bandits, having gathered Mongolian and Korean allied forces, have intensified their siege around Changchun. The airport has fallen, planes cannot land, and rice prices in the city have soared. The people can only find wild grass, gourd flowers, bean sprouts, and tree bark to fill their stomachs, while selling off their belongings to exchange for rice bran, distillers' grains, and soybean cakes for consumption. Distillers' grains, soybean meal, and tree bark are not meant for human consumption. Eating them not only impairs nutrition but also leads to digestive problems, resulting in widespread eye diseases and gastroenteritis. Bodies gradually weaken, hair becomes disheveled, and faces become dirty, ultimately leading to death in remote alleys, dilapidated walls, and between crude rooms and ditches. The people of Changchun are playing the leading roles in an unprecedented tragedy.

Air-dropped Food

Air-dropping food is an incredibly difficult task. The Communist bandits' goal is to "cut off the city's food supply, causing the people to collapse or starve, and to scatter the soldiers." Besides enticing soldiers to surrender their weapons and escape the encirclement, they are using anti-aircraft guns to threaten air transport. Therefore, airplanes have to fly high in the clouds. When dropping from low altitudes, it is difficult to guarantee that one hundred percent of the food lands in the city. Moreover, each bag contains a limited amount. Thus, the food dropped with great effort is mainly used for military purposes. Although the people do not receive any, they wholeheartedly welcome the air-dropped food. Whenever airplanes fly over Changchun, the citizens come out to look up and cheer, which can be said to be their only comfort.

In the marketplace, all that can be seen are sales of furniture and clothing. Although the prices are cheap, no one cares to ask. Shops like Tai Fa He have long been deserted and closed. For transactions involving large sums, weights and measures are used to determine the amount. The bank's temporary notes are denominated in units of hundreds of millions. Low-level employees can receive forty billion in currency each month. Only those who have grain are in a golden age. A small amount of rice can be exchanged for many things. Beautiful and delicate young girls are forced into unwanted marriages for ten pounds of rice, and a pair of pants can only be exchanged for a small scallion. Hunger is like a raging flood, attacking every kind-hearted person in Changchun. They look around at the corpses of the starved lying everywhere, a desolate scene. Friends look at each other and sigh, not knowing when the demon hand of starvation will snatch away their lives. Thus, they risk breaking through the encirclement, but batches are intercepted by the heavily guarded bandit outposts on Hongxi Street. The number of people has reached 160,000. Attempting to escape, they are blocked by the hideous Communist bandits, cutting off their path to survival.

Heavily Guarded Bandit Outposts

Hongxi Street is located southwest of Changchun, three kilometers away from the city, adjacent to the suburbs. During the Japanese puppet era, it was an area of residences for Japanese officials. Now, only empty shells remain. Outside the area bordering the suburbs, there are heavily guarded bandit outposts. The refugees intercepted inside are all those who want to break through the outposts to find food. They spend the entire night hoping that Guimenguan (the gate to hell) will allow them to pass. Some surrender weapons or silver dollars to buy a chance to live, while others try to crawl out at night. Unfortunately, if they are discovered, their tragic fate is immediately sealed. Looking at the people waiting inside to be released, most of them are emaciated, dispirited, and restless. Some are searching for green grass and wild flowers to fill their stomachs. Those who have relatives and friends on the street can still ask for supplies through correspondence. Those who have no relatives and friends are likely to find their final resting place in this area.

Starved Corpses Fill the Fields

One tragic scene involves abandoned children crying for their mothers until they have no strength left. They lie on the ground groaning for a long time, and no one cares for them. Perhaps their mothers have starved to death ten steps away, and the lives of these children are snatched away by the merciless god of death. Seeing these pitiful abandoned children, people naturally sympathize with them deeply, but they are also afraid that they will not be able to take their own children out, so they have no energy to care for others. Walking ten or twenty steps further, one can see the even more tragic scene of starved corpses lying everywhere, white bones filling the fields. There are no coffins for burial, and no one to bury them. They are naked, no different from the corpses of dogs and cats. People waiting to leave are touched by the scene, resolving themselves to their fate of death. If they cannot get past these few gates to hell, they will undoubtedly become companions to those skeletons in the future.

The reporter contacted several people who escaped from Changchun and listened to their tragic stories. I couldn't help but feel sad and moved. I record what I heard and present it to the enthusiastic compatriots in society, hoping they will jointly participate in the Changchun food transport and rescue campaign and provide the greatest spiritual support to the garrison troops in Changchun.

### A Murder Case at the Temple of Heaven in Beiping: A Failed Loan Leads to a Heinous Act; The Perpetrator, Li Ronghong, Surrenders to the Police

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 5th] Another murder case occurred at the Temple of Heaven in Beiping yesterday. The murderer, Li Ronghong, a retired air force officer from Shenyang, failed to borrow money from his friend Zhao Wanyun on the 4th, resulting in a grudge. He lured Zhao to the Temple of Heaven and stabbed him twelve times in the neck and back with a bayonet. After the murder, he surrendered to the police station. Zhao died before reaching the hospital. The murderer is currently under strict interrogation.

### In Liugou Town Between Chengde and Pingquan, Bandits Suffocate Living People in Cellars

[Air Mail Dispatch from Chengde, This Newspaper, 1st] Liugou is the largest town between Chengde and Pingquan. After the recent recovery, the railway is not open, and this place has become the only thoroughfare between Pingquan and Chengde. Liugou Town has been occupied by bandits for a full four months. After a visit by the reporter, it was learned that the residents' summer food supplies had long been looted by the bandits. Over ten young men were taken away. Secondly, those who served as Baojia chiefs for the bandits have all fled. Later, hearing that the National Army was lenient, they gradually returned. The Communist bandits invented a type of "suffocation" punishment in Liugou. They converted the courtyard of resident Pan Yuting into a district office and dug a cellar in the house. They would put the captured people inside and cover the opening with a large millstone, suffocating them to death. According to neighbors, "Many people have been imprisoned in the cellar, but they have all been taken away. One person suffocated to death, the son of Ma Mingyun from Nangou Mountain. The reason for the death penalty was due to the violation of grain requisition."

### Refugees in Northern Anhui Awaiting Relief in Bengbu

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, This Newspaper, 2nd] No fewer than four or five thousand young students have gathered here. As of July 1st, the number of middle school students who have applied and been approved for registration at the Bengbu Relief Station of the Anhui Youth Counseling Office has reached 4,080. The Counseling Office is providing relief to refugee students while also preparing to set up remedial classes to assist in their studies. The first batch of qualified students admitted to study numbered 1,113, and the second batch numbered over 400. Youths from the Fuyang, Linquan, and Taihe areas have appealed for the establishment of a temporary middle school, which has been approved in principle by the Ministry of Education. However, due to a lack of school sites, there is currently no hope of opening it. Fuyang United Middle School has found a school site in Linhuaiguan. Once the renovations are completed, classes can begin.

### Rent Reduction of 25% in Zhejiang Tolls the Death Knell for "Confused Landlords"

— Reporter for This Newspaper, Huang Xingtian

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 2nd] Since Chen Yi took office in Zhejiang, the most notable aspect of his governance policy has been the "moderate land reform." Because the land issue is the fundamental issue of China's economy, if the land issue can be resolved reasonably, the countryside can be stabilized, and the cities can have lasting prosperity. When Chen listed land reform as a provincial administrative task for the second half of this year, both landlords and farmers, inside and outside the province, paid close attention to the progress of this work. However, Chen recently told reporters, "The land ownership problem in Zhejiang is not serious. Due to the uneven distribution of the population in Zhejiang, there is less land and more people in eastern Zhejiang, and more land and fewer people in western Zhejiang. Planned immigration can solve most of the land problem." Since the provincial government has decided to carry out immigration in the 38th year, it is currently concentrating its efforts on thoroughly implementing a rent reduction of 25% instead of land reform, to reduce the burden on farmers.

Rent reduction of 25% is a measure to reconcile the interests of both tenants and landlords to stabilize the countryside. After the revolutionary government was established in Guangzhou, it was first tried out in Guangdong and Guangxi, and later gradually promoted to Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. Zhejiang has been implementing it since the 16th year of the Republic, and it can be said that it has not been hindered and undermined by local feudal forces like other provinces, which led to its suspension. This is the glory of Zhejiang. In the past 21 years, thanks to the efforts of the Party, government, and judicial organs, it cannot be said that there has been no considerable achievement. According to the survey table "Overview of the Implementation of Rent Reduction of 25% in Various Counties and Cities in Zhejiang Province" by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Social Affairs last year, before the rent reduction, the average rent generally accounted for 50.6% of the total annual product, while after the rent reduction, it was 37.55%. The rental burden on tenants has been reduced by an average of 13.05%, which is only 0.05% higher than the standard of 25% rent reduction. These figures look like a good achievement, but in reality, some counties have not implemented it at all (Fuyang, Pinghu, Chongde, Tongxiang, Wuxing, Xiangshan, Tangxi, Yongjia, and Xianju are nine counties that have not reported rent reduction), and some counties have only implemented it in some villages, or the rent reduction is limited to land with permanent tenancy rights. Obviously, rent reduction of 25% has not been implemented universally and thoroughly in Zhejiang. According to a survey by the Department of Social Affairs, there are still nine counties in the province where the rent accounts for more than 50% of the annual product, including Xindeng, Yuqian, Zhenhai, Dinghai, Shaoxing, Zhuji, Shengxian, Tiantai, and Linhai, and fourteen counties where it is more than 40%. The highest rent in Anji even reaches 75% of the annual product. Generally speaking, rent reduction of 25% can be implemented in areas where farmers' associations are well-organized and tenants have permanent tenancy rights, and due to the different distribution of arable land and population, the achievements in western Zhejiang are slightly better than those in eastern Zhejiang.

Main Reasons for Incomplete Implementation

The main difficulties that have prevented the universal, thorough, and even suspended implementation of rent reduction of 25% in the past are: (1) The power of landlords, local bullies, and gentry is too great. They either use their historical and traditional status or their control of rural political power to maintain their own interests, making tenants unable to resist. (2) The landlords are cunning and take advantage of loopholes, either creating clever rental agreements to maintain the original amount or prepaying the next year's rent during the autumn harvest, with the rent often exceeding half of the annual product. Tenants who do not pay the prepaid rent on time will have their land cultivated by others. (3) The farmers' associations are not well-organized or are even controlled by landlords, making it impossible to implement them. The administrative and judicial organs do not enforce them effectively, and because most of the officials are landlords, tenant disputes have not been handled fairly. To overcome these basic obstacles, it is mainly up to the organizers to have strong courage and perseverance, and to no longer allow landlords and local bullies to infiltrate the executive agencies and erode the enthusiasm of the revolution. Regarding the latter, in addition to stipulating that farmers' associations at all levels should recruit a large number of tenants and hired laborers as members, and that more than half of the directors of the rural farmers' associations must be tenants, Chairman Chen has also called on young people to fight against evil forces. This is a good starting point.

Saving Confused Landlords

Ba Yi himself has indeed made the greatest determination for rent reduction of 25%. In the 1570th meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee on August 19, he said earnestly: "…This year, rent reduction of 25% must be implemented universally in all parts of the province. This work should be carried out by the administrative organs, but if the resistance of evil forces is too great, we do not need to be overly拘泥 ordinary laws during this time of suppressing the chaos, and we can thoroughly implement the rent reduction of 25% decree with strong force. In order to fight against the Communist Party's land reform movement, to save the ordinary confused landlords from the pain of being liquidated and struggled by the Communist Party, and to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on equalizing land ownership, we must show the spirit of revolution and take revolutionary measures to do it firmly and bravely. Even if there are some places where it occasionally does not comply with the law, I am willing to be responsible to the central government. If any landlord obstructs the rent reduction of 25% decree, or even refuses to rent out land due to rent reduction of 25%, no matter how high his status or how great his power, just strictly enforce it…"

Watching Revolutionary Actions

These words are firm and powerful, completely in the tone of "iron-fisted politics." For those "confused landlords" in Zhejiang, it is ultimately a death knell, and for the millions of exploited tenants and hired laborers, it is no different from a dawn horn. But in today's countryside, which is seeking to realize the greatest, politics does not rely on propaganda, but on practical action. If Chairman Chen wants to stabilize the rural socio-economy of Zhejiang and universally implement rent reduction of 25% throughout the province this year, he cannot rely solely on his "revolutionary spirit," but mainly on his "revolutionary actions." The millions of farmers in Zhejiang have been awakened by his dawn horn and are watching closely for the appearance of his actions.

### National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee Resolves to Expand National Cotton Joint Purchasing Area; Joint Purchasing Funds Expanded to 150 Million Yuan; From October 10, Factories May Not Purchase Freely

[This Newspaper] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee held its fourth committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Liu Gongyun. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Area will be expanded from Shanghai and Hankou to a fully unified joint purchase. Joint purchasing locations will be temporarily set up in Shashi, Hankou, Xi'an, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Nantong, Chongqing, and eight other joint purchasing branches, as well as Jiading, Taicang, Zhoupu, Minhang, Changyinsha, and other joint purchasing stations. Each station will report directly to the Shanghai Joint Purchasing Headquarters. (2) The joint purchasing prices in various regions will be handled in accordance with the price limits in place at that time in various regions. (3) From October 10, factories may not purchase cotton freely anywhere in the country. However, cotton merchants may still purchase cotton in areas other than those where joint purchasing branches and stations are located. If they resell to the branches or stations, they must comply with the price limits in various regions. (4) Joint purchasing funds will be expanded to 150 million yuan, to be borne equally by the Central Bank and national private yarn factories. Two-thirds will be paid before October 10, and the remaining one-third will be paid when the cotton purchase amount reaches one-half of the expected target (3 million shi dan). The funds shared by each factory will be determined according to the number of yarn spindles. (3) In addition to the originally appointed Liu Gongyun, Li Lixia, Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Liu Jingji, and Wang Lanseng, seven members, Li Shuming, Fan Chengchuan, Pan Jianliang, Chen Shuceng, Shi Fengxiang, Yang San, Li Guowei, and Yang Yizhou, eight members, will be added as members.

### Customs Strengthens Inspection Procedures for Goods Shipped from Hong Kong to Chinese Ports

[This Newspaper] It is reported that in the past, in addition to ordinary import manifests and transit manifests, customs clearance for goods shipped from Hong Kong to China also required the submission of a copy of the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities. It is now learned that the customs authorities have new regulations to strengthen import inspections. The measures are as follows:

(1) Import packages carried on ships from Hong Kong (including those transferred by the captain)

In addition to listing details in ordinary import manifests or import package lists, each of these packages should be presented with the original package receipt issued by the port of departure. For packages shipped out of Hong Kong, the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities or the export package list certified by the Hong Kong government port affairs bureau should be presented, which should also detail the receipt numbers of each package. Packages that cannot present the package receipt from the original port of departure, or those that originate in Hong Kong but cannot present the certified export manifest or package list, will be regarded as "goods not listed on the manifest," and the customs will detain them and deal with them in accordance with regulations.

(2) Transit goods shipped by ships from Hong Kong to Chinese ports and passing through other Chinese ports.

For ships traveling from Hong Kong to two or more Chinese ports, in addition to preparing the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities and the ordinary import manifest to be presented to the customs of the designated Chinese port, (A) upon arrival at the first Chinese port, each transit manifest for the ship to other Chinese ports and the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities should be submitted to the customs officer boarding the ship for inspection. (B) Thereafter, upon arrival at the remaining Chinese ports, the transit manifest to the next port should also be submitted to the customs officer boarding the ship. As for ships that do not carry transit goods destined for Chinese ports, they should also fill out a blank transit manifest, or add a note at the end of the import manifest stating that "no transit goods were shipped from Hong Kong." If any ship fails to comply with these measures, the company managing it will be responsible for being penalized by the customs.

(3) Goods air-shipped from Hong Kong to China.

In addition to preparing ordinary import manifests, these goods must also be presented with the export manifest certified by the competent Hong Kong government agency. Goods not listed on the Hong Kong export manifest, even if listed on the import manifest, will be treated as "goods not listed on the manifest." The above measures will be implemented from today.

### Ministry of Finance Directs Key Points for Foreign Bank Capital Increase

[This Newspaper] The Financial Management Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, instructing the commercial banks to increase capital. "Foreign Banks in China, whose head offices are not located in our country, the minimum amount of paid-up capital of commercial banks stipulated in Article 3 of the 'Measures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks' should be based on the region where the representative office originally requested approval from the Ministry of Finance is located. If there are branch offices in different county and city areas, each branch office should be calculated by increasing one-tenth. Also, the section on convening a shareholders' meeting to discuss the capital increase method stipulated in Article 2 of the 'Procedures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks' may be exempted, but the representative (or manager of the representative office in China) or agent designated by its head office should apply in accordance with Article 355 of the Company Law. All other sections should be handled in accordance with regulations. The Financial Management Bureau has recently notified the city's Banking Association to inform the foreign banks to implement it immediately.

### Money Shops Adjust Interbank Lending Rates

The Silver, Money, and Trust Three Associations, after holding a meeting yesterday, decided that from today (6th), the daily interest rate for loans will be changed to 1.3 yuan per thousand yuan, the daily interest rate for interbank loans will be changed to 8 jiao per thousand yuan, and the daily interest rate for deposits will be changed to 4 jiao 5 fen per thousand yuan.

### Agricultural Bank Stops Providing Autumn Silkworm Loans from Last Year

According to sources from the Agricultural Bank of China: In order to tighten loans and absorb currency, the authorities have decided to stop issuing loans for this year's ; loans. Several silkworm farmers and cocoon merchants have requested the bank to open loans, but the bank stated that there is no need for this after the currency reform. Because interest rates are currently very low, even if the merchants lack capital, they can apply for loans from other banks besides the Agricultural Bank. There is currently a large amount of idle capital in the market, which can be used to guide money into rural areas and industry.

### Sluggish Silk Market Transactions

The human silk market yesterday was still attractive, but the trend was sluggish. Over-the-counter sales in this street were slightly light, the textile industry's allocation period was approaching again, and people's hearts were stable. However, the fierce rush to purchase various materials in recent days has greatly stimulated people's hearts. The quantity distributed by the association remains unchanged, and the allocation is minimal, forming a situation of "little porridge and many monks." Transactions for raw silk are scarce under price limits, and foreign sales have improved somewhat, but there are no goods available in the market, and the market is also cold.

Summer goods in silk and satin have already left the market. Due to the rush to purchase goods such as gauze and cloth in recent days, over-the-counter sales of winter women's clothing in this street are also facing a situation of supply not meeting demand. Bed covers are rarely supplied and sold under price limits, and both import and export are sluggish.

### Sugar Market Sees Mixed Ups and Downs

The sugar market was stable yesterday, with mixed ups and downs for each grade. The street was slightly dull, people's hearts were scattered, and many were watching from the sidelines, and transactions became rare. The 21st-period granulated white sugar showed fatigue after opening, and the market closed slightly better. Medium and coarse granulated sugar also showed an upward trend. Households consuming Four or Five Car White Refined sugar were watching from the sidelines, and the desire to sell was slightly looser. The market closed with a slight setback, and the rest were stable.

### Tea Market Base Solidified

Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market, transactions continued downstream. Holders, aware that raw tea prices in the production areas were at a peak and that the supply sources were quite restricted, stubbornly held onto their goods, hesitating to sell. Consequently, sample sales in the market were not vigorous. Although the buying interest of exporters remained high, they ultimately found themselves in a state of unfulfilled demand, and the volume of transactions decreased noticeably. Several varieties of tea were practically in a state of having a market but no goods, but their underlying potential was showing promise. As for tea for domestic sales, due to the short supply of available goods, the demand from Taicang, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places was strong, and the market foundation was even more solid than before.

### Unprecedented Sharp Decline in Arrivals Yesterday; Rice Market Situation Depressed; Limited Grain Transactions, Near-Total Lack of Edible Oil Supply

Rice arrivals continued to decrease. The South Market saw arrivals of 354 shi and 7 dou, including 205 shi of brown rice. The North Market experienced a severe shortage, with less than 100 shi, only 87 shi and 5 dou. The two markets combined totaled 442 shi. Trading in the market was still not open, and market quotations also decreased. The entire rice market was extremely quiet, and by 10 o'clock, all traders had left.

Flour

The market remained closed as before. Most traders did not even go to the market. The past bustling atmosphere was now replaced by a desolate stillness.

Grains

Transactions saw a further decrease. The amount of soybeans offered was even less. Only seven packages of Poyangzi soybeans were offered sporadically, priced at 13 yuan and 8 jiao. Over 200 packages of Poyangzi black beans were offered, priced at 12 yuan, which were also absorbed by the local market. Corn, red sorghum, broad beans, fava beans, and naked barley were not offered at all. There were still many sesame transactions, but the supply side had also weakened. Fresh raw peanuts from Nanjing continued to be offered, priced at 35 yuan and 7 jiao.

Edible Oil

Only a few dozen barrels of cooked rapeseed oil were offered in the entire city, priced at 43 yuan and 3 jiao. There were no other transactions. Factory allocations from the previous day were temporarily suspended due to disagreements at the China Plant Factory. Furthermore, other oil factories were also unable to make allocations, resulting in a near-total supply suspension in the market, causing great shortages for retailers. Also, yesterday, the police station specially dispatched two mobile police officers to maintain order in the market, but the market order was very good, and no incidents occurred.

### Three Rice and Grain Markets to Cease Collective Trading

Following the cessation of trading in the cotton yarn and cloth markets, the three rice, flour, and grain markets in this city will also cease trading. There are three reasons for the cessation:

(1) Since the currency reform, transactions in these three markets have become increasingly sluggish, and the sources of supply have become scarce. Most of the members dealing in rice, flour, and grains have stopped buying and selling in the market, and the daily transaction volume in the market is extremely small.

(2) Due to the scarcity of sources in the market, retail rice merchants are now purchasing directly from production areas and transporting the goods to Shanghai for sale. Although the quantities are small, they are sufficient to maintain the sales of a single store.

(3) With the cessation of market trading, exploitation by middlemen between production areas and retailers can be avoided, and rice prices may be lower. Based on various reasons, these markets are currently deemed unnecessary.

### 100,000 Tons of Clean Coal to Be Opened to Supplement the City's Fuel

[This Newspaper's Report] The Materials and Finance Committee of the Central Bank held its ninth meeting yesterday (the 4th) at 5:00 PM, chaired by convener Li Lixia, to discuss several proposed resolutions. It is reported that regarding the requests from various parties to entrust the procurement of domestic cotton, the committee decided to temporarily postpone discussion in order to comply with the original purpose of unified procurement, as the National Cotton Joint Procurement Office has already been established. Furthermore, regarding the proposal from the Four Joint Offices to allocate 100,000 tons of clean coal, the committee suggested that it be delivered in Shanghai over three months to supplement the city's fuel shortage.

### Yarn Merchant Representatives Visit Supervisor Jiang, Requesting Prompt Promulgation of Distribution Regulations; Fangjian Company Sold Cotton Cloth Yesterday as Usual

The cotton yarn market in this city has been ordered by the Shanghai Economic Control Supervisor to cease trading. According to Tang, Chairman of the Yarn Merchants Association, after the association received the order to suspend business from the previous day, the operations of 620 fellow merchants were brought to a standstill. However, retail yarn shops are still continuing to operate. Once their stocks of yarn are sold out, they will also automatically close. There are also 440 brokers who have become unemployed as a result. Yesterday morning (the 5th), the association sent representatives to the National Bank to meet with Supervisor Jiang to request instructions and to request the prompt promulgation of distribution regulations so that business can be restored as soon as possible to maintain their livelihoods.

Yesterday was the second day that cotton cloth was ordered to cease trading. Although there were no transactions inside or outside the market, innerwear factories and Western clothing factories needed lining cloth, but dyeing and weaving factories and Fangjian Company did not supply it, causing a great deal of panic. Fine cloths such as Longtou, Wufu, and Laba Tong, as well as Yuan Bijie, were in high demand.

It is also reported that Fangjian Company sold cotton cloth as usual, including 12-pound Yang He B-grade fine cloth priced at 23 yuan and 6 jiao per bolt, Sijunzi Yuan straight tribute tweed at 29 yuan and 8 jiao, Yuan Bijie at 28 yuan and 2 jiao, Yuan Mercerized cloth at 33 yuan, 42-yard Laoshouxing bleached cloth at 26 yuan and 8 jiao, average 42-yard gray fine cloth at 27 yuan and 3 jiao, 29-yard half-width brand Bijie semi-finished cloth at 23 yuan and 3 jiao, and Hongguang fine Yuan yarn tribute satin at 28 yuan and 3 jiao. Second-grade light-colored printed color ting was priced at 18 yuan, light-colored floral foreign-style fabric at 18 yuan and 2 jiao, and 30-yard Longxu 10-pound coarse cloth at 18 yuan, and Ding 4-yard Yuan fine cloth at 2 yuan and 5 fen per pound. Also, grass-yellow khaki was priced at 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 7 fen, and was limited to door sales merchants. Tiaoli 777 Evergreen Bijie was priced at 27 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen, and was limited to dyeing factories. Second-grade 29-yard half-width Bijie semi-finished cloth was priced at 23 yuan and 3 jiao, and second-grade 40-yard 10-pound semi-finished cloth was priced at 25 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen, totaling 15 types. Also, there were four types of American and Mexican colored cloth, with each household limited to purchasing one type. It is said that a small number of firms sold their purchase permits for an additional 2 yuan and some change. Other types of cloth could be purchased in larger quantities, so the applications were quite enthusiastic.

It is also reported that the Cotton Cloth Association allocated approximately 26,000 bolts of cloth to the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association. Members of the industry association applied to purchase a total of 170,000 bolts. Due to the imbalance between supply and demand, the association once again adopted a lottery method.

Cotton Market Remains Cold

The cotton market has not heard of any transactions opening yet. The market situation is cautiously holding. Booths have no prices and no market. It is rumored that newly harvested cotton from nearby areas of Shanghai suburbs has already entered the market, but cotton farmers are very reluctant to sell, mainly because the price of cotton and the price of rice cannot be reconciled, so transactions are sparse.

He also cited the saying "to ascend high, one must start from low" to encourage the teachers and students. Ye Bingfu then delivered a speech, after which the meeting adjourned.

(4) The inspection standard is based on the standards issued by the Ministry, but this semester will focus on extracurricular activities. (5) Cases such as overcharging tuition fees are urgently being investigated, and supervision has not yet begun. The supervision methods for the too-busy period may be determined tomorrow, and supervision can begin after the decision. (6) It is hoped that the guidance director can continue to cooperate closely with the office. By the time all the reviews were completed, it was already 6 o'clock, and the meeting adjourned successfully.

### Chairman Ding Convenes Provincial Middle School Principals' Discussion Meeting in Zhenjiang; Exchanges Educational Opinions and Promises to Improve Difficulties

[This Newspaper's Zhenjiang 5th Dispatch] Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ding convened a discussion meeting with over 40 middle school principals from the province this morning to listen to the opinions of the education sector. Mr. Ding gave an impromptu speech: (1) Strengthening the arc of 100% confidence in the victory of suppressing the rebellion, adhering to educational positions, and enduring this difficult period. (2) The promotion of national thought, the continuation of national culture, and the transformation of social customs all depend on the shoulders of educators. (3) If there are any difficulties in school affairs in the future, we will do our best to improve them. After the speech, the principals spoke successively, unanimously agreeing that education should emphasize both quality and quantity, with character taking precedence in teaching and talent cultivation as the main goal. Vocational teacher training and general middle school education should both be ideal. Insufficient school funding, poor facilities, and the inability to stabilize the lives of teachers are currently the most difficult problems.

### Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament Scheduled to Open on the 15th; 13 Teams Participating in Group A; More Teams in Group B, Lottery Tomorrow

The 8th Morning Friends Cup Basketball League, organized by the Morning Friends Group of the Shanghai YMCA Sports Department, closed registration some days ago.

There are 13 teams in Group A: Huili, Morning Friends, Shan Team, Renyu, Chunmao, Pei'er, Xinsheng, Police Machinery, Lehe, Taikang, Shangxing Jianle, and Zhongxing. There are 57 teams in Group B. The League Committee met yesterday to review the teams and considered that the Zhongxing team, which registered for Group B, was very strong and should be promoted to Group A. All others were qualified. However, due to the excessive number of participating teams, it was impossible to accept all of them. It was decided to proceed in accordance with the original regulations and to adopt a lottery method to reduce the 32 non-member teams applying to participate by 15 teams before inviting them to participate. The lottery is scheduled to be held at 5:30 PM tomorrow (the 7th) in the Friendship Room of the Sports Department of the Association at Eight Immortals Bridge. The following teams are requested to send one representative each to attend on time. Absence will be considered a waiver.

### Yinchuan Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Shanghai Easily Defeats Jianchang

In the Yinchuan Cup table tennis match some days ago, Shanghai and Jianchang faced off in the Yinzhi Group at the Bank of China's gymnasium. The former's basketball team has always been well-known in the banking community. The table tennis team has been inactive for a long time. This time, under the urging of team leader Wang Zongli, they made a comeback. In their first trial run the other day, veterans Lu Jixing and Zhang Hongsheng, as well as the three young players Chen Quan, Yang Yongkang, and Ling Kecheng, developed evenly and easily won a big victory by a score of 13 to 2. Gu Shenghui of Jianchang, who is talented in all areas, stood by and watched, which was also the main reason for the disastrous defeat. The match results are recorded as follows:

Shanghai Wins Losses

Yang Yongkang Three Zero

Ling Kecheng Two One

Lu Jixing Three Zero

Chen Quan Three Zero

Zhang Hongsheng Two One

Jianchang Wins Losses

Zhang Yongyi One Two

Zheng Baoqi Zero Three

Yan Zhimin Zero Three

Xin Kequan Zero Three

Zhang Yongling One Two

The other day, in the Qianzhi Group, Youbang faced off against Pudong. The strength of the two sides was far apart, resulting in a one-sided affair. Youbang fought calmly, with Lu Shentao breaking through four levels on his own, revealing his brilliance. As a result, Youbang beat Pudong 13 to 3, achieving a successful start. In another match in the Muyi Group, Zhejiang Shi faced China Bai at the Siming Gymnasium. In the first round, China Bai was behind 1 to 4. Although they tried harder afterwards, they were unable to surpass the opponent. However, they posed a considerable threat to the opponent. Unfortunately, due to losing too many points in the first round, they suffered the regret of a bad start. As a result, Zhejiang Shi overcame China Bai 13 to 7.

Today (the 6th), there will be four more matches. Chunmao, which failed in the third Yizhi Group table tennis league, will put all its efforts into winning the Qianzhi Group championship. There are no strong players in the Zhongnong nong team, so it is feared that they will not be able to withstand Chunmao's attack. Others, such as Huachi and Siming, are strong and capable and can seize the victory. The results from yesterday are recorded as follows:

Youbang defeated Pudong (Qian) 13-3

Zhejiang Shi defeated China Bai (Yi) 13-7

(Today's Schedule)

Huaqiao - Donglai (Yin) 6:00 PM China

Huachi - Zhongyang Yi (Yin) 6:00 PM Huachi

Chunmao - Zhongnong Nong (Qian) 6:00 PM Zhongnong

Siming - Xinhua (Yi) 6:00 PM Siming

### Youth Tennis Training Class Scheduled to Open Early

The Youth Tennis Association has opened a youth training class to promote youth tennis and create a good foundation. Registration has already closed. The original quota was 30 people, but the registration was enthusiastic, with six women. As such it was broadened to 36 people, still leaving over a dozen people who could not be accommodated due to space limitations. In order to facilitate the lesson times of each participant, they will be divided into two classes, one class scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the other class scheduled for Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The association has scheduled a standing committee meeting today to review the association's affairs and to make specific decisions on the implementation of the training class. The opening date is also scheduled to be moved forward to 2:00 PM on the 9th.

### Father-Son Tennis Tournament

At one point, as many as 24 pairs participated, generating intense enthusiasm. Now, Hou Danian of the Green Light Association continues to promote the event, inviting Huang Shaohong, Hu Yunlai, Zhang Zizhen, Feng Jiaozhun, Hu Xiansheng, and other veterans of the tennis world to serve as committee members. Registration begins today and will close on October 12th. The matches are scheduled to begin on October 16th and will be held at the Green Light venue. The Green Light Association will also be responsible for soliciting donations for the tennis balls. It is anticipated that participation this season will be even more enthusiastic.

### Middle School Cup Volleyball Tournament - League Regulations Announced, Registration Begins

The Middle School Cup Volleyball League, organized by the City Gymnasium, began registration yesterday. The gymnasium aims to assist middle schools in the city in promoting extracurricular activities and advocating for a larger-scale inter-school volleyball competition. This will allow participating schools to improve their skills, strengthen relationships, increase competitive interest, and contribute to the national movement of diligence and thrift in building the country. The intention is profound, and all middle schools in the city with volleyball teams are welcome to participate. The following is a summary of the league regulations:

Any public or private middle school volleyball team in the city, male or female, may register to participate (each school may participate with a maximum of one male and one female team. The registration form must be signed and stamped by the principal and the physical education director, and the school seal must be affixed.)

All teams registering to participate in the competition must submit a list of all team members and photos (two photos per person) to the gymnasium's guidance department for registration within the stipulated period before the start of the league, along with a registration fee of five yuan and a security deposit of ten yuan (the security deposit will be refunded at the end of the league). A team that forfeits once will forfeit its security deposit; a team that forfeits twice will be disqualified from this year's league.

Each registered team is limited to twelve players, all of whom must be students enrolled in the school.

The rules of the game for both male and female divisions will follow the regulations of the 7th National Games. (Net height: men 2.15 meters, women 2.0 meters)

This league is divided into male and female divisions, both using a single round-robin format. If there are too many participating teams, they will be divided into groups. A best-of-three format will be used, with a best-of-five format used in the group finals.

The scheduled game schedule, dates, and times cannot be changed by any team, except in cases where the gymnasium has special circumstances and wishes to make changes.

Any team that is more than ten minutes late to the venue according to the gymnasium's clock will be considered to have forfeited the game.

Each team must have at least six players present to participate in the league; otherwise, it will be considered a forfeit.

All league matches will be held at the gymnasium, with matches on Saturday afternoons and all day on Sundays.

If a team has a protest, it should formally submit a written protest along with a protest fee. The protest should be delivered to the league committee within 24 hours of the incident. If the protest is upheld, the protest fee will be refunded; otherwise, it will be forfeited.

### Basketball Exhibition Game Tomorrow Night - Huili Team to Play Mixed Team - 7 PM at the City Gymnasium

The City Sports Reporters Association originally planned to host a basketball exhibition game tonight, inviting a mixed team to play against Dagong. However, on the eve of the game, the Dagong team suddenly announced that they needed to handle出国手续 (departure procedures) and vaccinations, and would not have time to participate. The Association had received a formal reply from the team authorities a week ago, accepting the invitation, making the last-minute cancellation regrettable. It is generally speculated that Dagong's recent crushing defeat by the Ziqi team has greatly affected the players' morale, and their performance would inevitably be逊色 (inferior). Against the mixed team of Hualian and Chenyou, victory was by no means guaranteed. This fear of losing may be one of the reasons for their inability to participate. With all preparations complete, the Sports Reporters Association has decided to instead invite the Huili team to perform against the mixed team, tomorrow night (Thursday) at 7 PM at the gymnasium. The Huili team recently hired Qian Xucang as a consultant and returned triumphantly from an expedition to Jingxi a few weeks ago. They are sure to deliver a spectacular performance. The mixed team combines the elite of Hualian and Chenyou, including several World Games representatives. The remaining players are also first-class experts, making their fighting power formidable. The match with Huili is sure to be a fierce battle. Huili's main player, Cao Zhiji, had gone to Beijing for business. The Zhengtai Factory urgently telegraphed him yesterday to return in order to strengthen the team's strength.

### Victory Cup Volleyball

St. John's Secures Championship Berth

The Victory Cup volleyball tournament completed its consolation championship and semi-final matches last night. In the consolation semi-final, Zhenhua competed against Fanxing. Zhenhua, with its tight teamwork, defeated the enemy three games to zero, and will play Tie Ma on the 8th for the consolation championship.

Following that, in the championship semi-final, St. John's competed against Jingwu Association for a place in the final. St. John's reversed the situation to win three games to one, securing the place in the final. They will face Yongyi on the 8th to decide the champion. The results of yesterday's matches are recorded below:

Zhenhua 21-13 21-18 21-17 Fanxing

St. John's 21-23 21-8 21-10 21-15 Jingwu

### Nanjing Football League - Player Registration Being Processed

The teams that have pre-registered for the Nanjing Football League include Samsung, Xin Xianlin, Huaguang, Hengyisheng, Pan Team, and Far East, a total of six teams. Longtou has also verbally stated their intention to participate, but has not yet notified the sports field in writing. The field has notified the above six teams separately yesterday that player registration procedures should be completed from today until Double Tenth Day. When registering, players must submit a 2.5-inch half-length photo and a registration fee of 金圆券 (gold yuan notes) 0.5 yuan per person. Each team is limited to 15 registered players. After one match has been played, each team may add two new players each time, but must complete the registration procedures 48 hours before the start of the match. As for the applications to participate from teams other than the 复兴杯 (Revival Cup) group champions, there are nearly ten more teams. Due to the limited space at the field, only eight vacant spots are available. Therefore, a decision will be made after the above teams have completed the registration procedures, and the vacant spots will be filled by the applicant teams.

### Xuhui vs. Pan Team in Football Match

The Xuhui football team is scheduled to play against the Pan Team at 3:30 PM today at the school's field in Xujiahui. The Pan Team has participated in this year's Group B League and is not weak. Xuhui is known in the football world. When they meet, a fierce battle is inevitable.

### A Weak Voice

— Lei Ting

For the sake of livelihood, perhaps by chance, I resumed my teaching career after abandoning it for more than ten years; moreover, I've been teaching for three years, and at a school that is "quite reputable."

With my kind of "teacher qualifications" squeezed into a "quite reputable" school, I was initially a little apprehensive, and even a little ashamed of "filling the ranks." However, as time went on, the feeling of "filling the ranks" gradually faded, and doubts about the reputation of "quite reputable" schools expanded.

My so-called "filling the ranks" stems from the fact that I teach for a living - that is, I regard the teaching position as a job; not only do I lack the spirit of "teaching for education," but I also lack the lofty will to "nurture talents"; in a word, it's just for food. Entering the sacred field of education with this attitude, "guilt" should be a condemnation that someone with a remaining conscience should feel, right?

However, as time went on, I not only stopped feeling "guilty" but even became a little proud. Because I see my colleagues not only lacking the spirit of "teaching for education," but even those who treat the teaching position as a job and work earnestly are very few. At most, they only regard it as a side business.

Need evidence? It's readily available.

I remember that whenever the semester started, after half a year's salary was paid out, the teachers' room was immediately flooded with talk about prices: gold, US dollars, cotton yarn, and what-not. They chimed in and harmonized, creating a ruckus. Then came talk about what you invested in and what I invested in. Some invested together, some did it alone (of course, very few were successful). Later, they followed the ups and downs of the invested goods, the overjoyed at the profits, boasting of their unique insight, and the dejected at the losses, regretting their incompetence. I ask you, how much energy is left to engage in nurturing the next generation under such tight or relaxed circumstances? Being able to muddle through is already a talent.

This phenomenon, of course, cannot be blamed solely on the teachers; the teachers cannot bear the responsibility for the environment that creates it. Sacred work cannot be demanded from people who are weeping in rags and whose children are crying from hunger and cold. However, this is the reality, the reality of the education sector for more than two years since the victory!

My doubt about the reputation of "quite reputable" schools is that "reputation" is only its exterior and not its content. For example, reciting the classics has long become a joke, but the Analects or Mencius have become required textbooks for junior high school. As for senior high school, students have to write essays on this and that; the more ancient the topic, the more erudite the teacher seems, and the longer the essay, the more outstanding the teacher seems, and the articles are all in the style of antiquity, either from the Tang or Song dynasties. Order is also something they emphasize particularly. As long as teachers have a way to turn students into puppets, lined up in the classroom, they are first-rate teachers. As for the methods of discipline, however, they are all up to you: hitting the palm of the hand is okay, kneeling is also fine. In short, if you can turn students into underage old people, that is your "teaching performance."

This situation seems to be prevalent in the Chinese education sector in the mid-20th century!

This situation is heartbreaking, but it is natural under the current circumstances where education is regarded as an ornament. Therefore, the condition of our next generation can be imagined.

Whoever can eradicate the teachers' despicable mentality of treating the teaching position as a side business, whoever can expose or eliminate the false reputation of "quite reputable" schools, is the true Chinese hero, the national savior!

For the sake of our next generation, I am willing to voice this weak call about the unreasonable educational phenomena of destroying youth that I have heard and witnessed for more than two years.

### Critic

— Le

One bright spring morning, the famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius took his students for a walk in the forest. The birds were singing, the flowers were fragrant, and the weather was excellent.

Sibelius had always enjoyed walking in the woods, and he could identify the different birds by their calls. As they walked, Sibelius told his students the names of the various birds.

Suddenly, a crow came along and cawed very loudly, disturbing the beautiful sounds of nature in the forest.

"What bird is that?" asked Sibelius' student.

The great musician replied with great disgust:

"A critic."

### The Food Problem

— Ze Shi

Recently, the food problem in England has become quite serious. A British person said: "Why can't we produce more food? Because we have to export agricultural machinery. Why do we have to export it? Because it makes foreign countries produce more food. Why do we want them to produce more food? So that they can export it to us. Why do we want to export more to us? Because we don't have enough to eat. Why don't we have enough to eat? Because we must export..." This is not a joke. The joke is politics.

Looking at British and American magazines in recent years, they are quite concerned about the problem of too little land, too many people, and not enough food. The United Nations has a Food and Agriculture Organization that has loudly warned the world: restoring pre-war food levels is of no use because the world's population is increasing day by day.

Is there a solution? Yes. If England doesn't export agricultural machinery and strives to increase production, the British Isles may be self-sufficient. But the government must export - to exchange for foreign currency. What is the foreign currency used for? To repay war debts or to fund military spending.

If countries diverted the funds spent on military scientific research to agriculture, agricultural production would increase greatly, and people would not have to worry about food. But no, military first, atomic bombs first. Too many people and not enough food? Okay, drop a few atomic bombs and kill hundreds of millions of people, and the food problem will be solved—or at least half solved?

There is another way: fewer "blessings of adding sons." But that won't do. Hitler encouraged Germans to have more sons; do you think that fascism should be overthrown? Hold on. England is the most democratic, but it is using every method to reward having many children and grandchildren. The government, organizations, and individuals are all doing their best to promote childbirth. England's democracy may be old or fake democracy, so what about the new and true democracy of the Soviet Union? I hear that the Chinese Goddess of Mercy has followers in the Soviet Union.

Planned reduction of food production, and planned multi-child families; it's planned to make people starve for public service. China is more advanced in this respect: everything is left to fate. For four or five thousand years, nothing has gone wrong. Excellent, excellent!

### Wandering Through Caihua Path

— Yao Yuanchu

Caihua Path in Shijiazhuang, north of Songjiang, is inhabited by many bamboo artisans. Continuous fields of bamboo stretch for tens of millions of stalks, dense and lush, so that from the outside, the path seems to disappear. Gradually going down, pushing aside artemisia and brambles, stepping on fallen leaves, after several turns, it suddenly opens up, with tiled houses, bamboo fences, and glazed windows, hidden in the misty haze. Ducks are released in the ponds, cattle return to the fences, and children and women seem to be enjoying themselves. Indeed, the world outside Wuling is originally an allegory for isolated indignation; recluses in deep mountains are not suitable for the present world. Such a place, densely located in the city, accessible by cart wheels, is simply that travelers have not yet arrived, so it is not worth mentioning. However, its waters are clear and bright, the fields are secluded and deep, the autumn air is refreshing, and walking with a bamboo staff is not entirely insufficient for relaxation. I record a short poem to express its beauty.

Where sunlight does not reach, village sounds are heard from time to time; the path ends where the stream rises green; bamboo merges with the horizontal fence; evading the world is not a plan, each has their own business in laborious life; returning to Jiangyun with double intentions, the lush green invites leisurely strolls.

### Rhyming with Uncle Fan on Mr. Zhegu's Inkstone

— Huang Yunmei

My head can be severed, but my will cannot be taken away; the partridge's strange actions are strikingly abrupt; lights flicker in Baiyun Village; celebrating resurrection on the edge of death. From now on, I am a landless orchid, coming and going alone, not returning to my old home. In the barren mountains, the white days are white; I would rather rinse my mouth with neighboring stones until death. Selling art in poor markets with a low hat brim, who recognizes the loyal heart hidden in my clothes? How pitiful, emperors and kings follow fleeting flowers; Mr.'s relics emerge from the sea; the stone box's inscriptions are buried in cold flames; losing that and gaining this increases sighs. 米芾 (Mi Fu) could appraise ancient good inkstones, and once said that this inkstone was an excellent choice; for hundreds of years, mud has settled at the bottom of the Fen River, with dragons protecting it, stopping the battles. Alas, the remote mountain stronghold connects to Wengzhou, ruler and subject weeping in the autumn breeze; past events are like dreams, unbearable to look back! Unbearable to look back, looking at the old shores, the barbarian horses come again to graze on our land; what need is there to hide the ten-layered leather case? We should draft an檄文 (proclamation) and raise the drums of righteousness!

### Competition

— Liu An

Vanderbilt was one of the richest men in America. He used to run the New York Central Railroad Company. Another rival, Gould, ran the American Eastern Railroad Company. America's railroads were originally privately run, so the competition was very fierce. Initially, the freight for transporting cattle from Buffalo to New York was $125 per car. Vanderbilt, in order to grab business, lowered it to $100. Gould was not willing to give up, and lowered it to $75. Vanderbilt lowered it again, to $50. Gould came up with another trick, lowering it to $25. Vanderbilt made an astonishing move: transporting cattle from Buffalo to New York would cost only one dollar per car!

Gould couldn't stand it, and all the business went to Vanderbilt. But Gould had another brilliant plan: he secretly went into the livestock business, buying a large number of cattle from Buffalo and transporting them to New York on the railroads run by Vanderbilt. Because the freight was low, and the price of cattle in New York was always much higher than in Buffalo, he actually made a fortune in the process.

### Various Collections

— Zheng Yimei

"Having a hobby can burden one's body." However, if a person has no hobby, then life feels dull and the spirit has nothing to rely on. Hence, there are so-called collectors, who widely collect and extensively acquire, exhibiting, playing with, and rubbing them, all for the purpose of alleviating worries, resolving sorrows, pleasing the mind, and satisfying the nature. Indeed, they cannot be severely criticized. I am one such collector, specializing in searching for letters from past sages and contemporary figures, accumulating more than a thousand pieces, which I consider more valuable than gold and foreign currency. People from Jing laugh at me for being foolish, and ignore me. According to what I know, Ye Xia'an of Panyu has Ming Xuande incense burners that fill his cabinet. Gong Zhanlu, a Grand Historian, had 300 Yangxian Zisha teapots, mostly made by famous artisans such as Dabin, Mansheng, Maolin, and Zhongfang, making his collection the richest in the country. Also, calligrapher Feng Chaoran cherished small ivory boxes, playing with them all day long and never letting them out of his hand. Even a slight touch causing minor damage would lead to several days of regret. Someone told him, "If you are sick and moaning in bed for dozens of days, this box will certainly not remember you." Chaoran smiled at this. Also, Yuan Lizhun, a lecturer, was skilled in calligraphy and painting and collected a great deal of ink, writing "Ink Essays" with meticulous annotations, not lightly showing them to others. Qian Huofo, a famous painter of Buddhas, had tastes quite different from others. He spent decades of effort accumulating cigarette boxes and matchboxes, no less than several thousand kinds, calling them "incense and fire karma," which drew laughter from viewers when occasionally exhibited. Also, my deceased friend Huang Huiwen of the Nanshe collected twenty-six inkstones, including a half-moon shaped one that originally belonged to Ma Yichu. It had inscriptions by Chen Tao'an, Zhu Jiangcun, Ma Tongbo, Zhang Taiyan, Yang Yungou, Wu Jiongzhai, Zhu Zhenzhuang, Ma Yifu, and others. Huiwen begged it from Jia Chu, and Yichu generously gave it to him. When Huiwen passed away, his belongings were scattered and lost. Yichu bought it from a merchant, and it was truly a story of the pearl returning to He Pu, especially celebrated in literary circles. Also, Wu Hufan collected fans with calligraphy by Zhuangyuan (top scholars in the imperial examination) from the Qing Dynasty for over two hundred years, accumulating a large volume. Also, Zhuang Tongbai of Changzhou would collect and preserve examples of calligraphy and painting price lists, creating a grand spectacle. Also, Wang Yitang, the owner of the Jin Chuanshi Lou, who was executed, collected dozens of ancient qins (zithers), with jade tuning pegs and gold frets, many of which were fine pieces. Now, I don't know where they have drifted off to, alas.

### On the Sea

— Chen Yanfan

A ship bound for a certain commercial port left Shanghai.

It was eight o'clock in the morning, and the tall buildings on both sides of the Huangpu River gradually moved backwards. The morning breeze was cool, and the surface of the river was rippling. One could see the green fields of Pudong covered in mist.

But the passengers on board, it seemed, were not in a happy mood. Some had boarded the ship the night before, and although it hadn't sailed, they hadn't slept well. Others were traveling on a small ship, with most of them having bought third-class tickets, and there was no place to sleep. The ship was old, and not very clean. The cabins and aisles were narrow. There was no choice but to find an empty space on the deck, surround it with blankets, and spread out mats and bedding to sleep. This inevitably encroached on or interfered with the sleeping space of others, and there were some who were encroached on or interfered with. At the same time, they had to worry about the large amount of coal ash drifting down from the smokestack, or the sudden rain at night.

Before long, two passengers started arguing under the awning of the aft cabin below. One of them seemed to be a woman, and the other a man. They were probably strangers. A woman chattered incessantly, which angered the man. This kind of quarrel soon subsided naturally. But there were three more incidents on this day. The biggest incident involved a soldier and a middle-aged man, who argued loudly, shouting and cursing, almost coming to blows. I lay in a relatively safe place, listening. Summarizing, I could come to a conclusion that most of the arguments were unnecessary. (1) One of them must have been arrogant, unreasonable, and vulgar, or an unintentional remark was misunderstood by the other party. (2) One party must have not considered the other, or calculated too much for themselves. (3) Due to a restless and impatient mood, people who often argue with others are unable to engage in beneficial thought in their spare time. Dissatisfaction with the environment, restlessness, and free time, like many wild animals locked in a narrow cage, also bite each other. Sometimes, people's unreasonable and unprofitable fights seem to be like that situation.

A whole day and night of strong winds and waves.

All the people on the ship, whether they had vomited or not, were sleeping peacefully and quietly. Thinking about it was funny, at this time no one was angry, and no one wanted to make trouble. No one wanted to eat or drink tea, and there were even no people walking around.

The calm had returned. Two people were sitting next to the ship's railing. One asked the other, "Do you still remember the taste of last night's storm?" The person sitting next to him said, "Really, as soon as the storm subsides, people immediately feel as fresh as if they woke up from a dream. How big was last night's storm? How uncomfortable was it to lie down? It seems I can't remember at all." This sentence is very interesting, and from this, one can infer the weakness of people's memory of suffering. A slave who is freed immediately forgets his inhuman life; a poor person who becomes rich immediately forgets his days of freezing and hunger. Once the flood is over, the impression of the disaster suddenly disappears; once the war is over, the memories of the suffering and misery quickly disappear. People's memories sometimes seem to be rooted in unnecessary things. For example, in Maupassant's story "Martin Baptiste," that kind woman was despised by others throughout her life for something that was not her own fault, and even died for it. That woman was defiled by the male servant when she was a child, so the children would not play with her, the adults would not get close to her, and even after marriage people would not forgive her, letting her die miserably. Here, God seems to have a mysterious arrangement, I don't know why.

### China Merchants Electric Company - Respectfully Responds to Inquiries from Residents of Jinyi Road

Emergency Repairs Please Call 02-70040 70971

We acknowledge receipt of your department's letter of September 25th, along with an attached letter from residents of Lane 195, Jinyi Road, regarding the emergency repair of the broken power lines at that location after they were struck by lightning at 5:30 PM on September 20th. According to our investigation, at 5:45 PM that afternoon, our company received a phone call from a resident at that location reporting the incident. We immediately contacted the Zhongshan Road transformer substation to have the main switch for that line tripped, which was done at 5:50 PM, as recorded in our records. At the same time, we dispatched employees to rush to the scene for repairs. Due to the travel time by vehicle, they arrived at the location a little after 6:10 PM. According to reports, the downed power lines had been cut by the fire department by thirty to forty feet, indicating that the current had already been cut off; otherwise, they would not have been able to cut the lines. Our company immediately dispatches employees to inspect and repair faulty lines upon discovery and strives to cut off the power supply as much as possible to ensure safety. However, due to the vastness of the power grid, we still rely on the assistance of local residents to report any issues by telephone at any time so that we can rush to the scene for rescue. In the event of such incidents, please call 02-70040 or 70971 directly to report them in order to avoid delays. We hereby reply to your department and respectfully request that this be conveyed to the public. Sincerely, Shanghai China Merchants Electric Co., Ltd., Community Services Department, Shenbao Editorial Department
