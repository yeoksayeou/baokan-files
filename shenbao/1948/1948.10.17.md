### Legislative Yuan's Legal Committee Reviews the Civil Servants' Salary Law

### Relevant Departments to Send Personnel to Attend and Explain

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Legislative Yuan committees convened separately on the 16th to handle cases. In the morning, the Legal Committee initially reviewed the draft Civil Servants' Salary Law. The Ministry of Personnel of the Examination Yuan and the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan sent personnel to attend, explain, and answer questions. The committee members expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that our country's official system has not yet been established and that civil servants are both extremely hardworking and have no guarantee of security. They also put forward supplementary and amending opinions on the content of the draft law. The joint group of the Agriculture and Forestry Committee, the Water Conservancy Committee, and the Legal Committee initially reviewed the draft organizational regulations of the Agricultural Census Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Ye Qianji, the director of the Agricultural Economics Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, attended and explained that the establishment of the committee was to prepare for the worldwide agricultural census to be held by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in 1950. However, after discussion by the committee members, it was unanimously agreed that the responsibilities of the Agricultural Census Committee listed in the draft organizational regulations could be handled by the original competent departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The funding for the census could be obtained after the completion of the legislative process of the Census Regulations. Therefore, it was decided that the draft organizational regulations should not be reviewed. As for the agricultural census work, it is a national matter and should be discussed after the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has drafted the Census Regulations and sent them to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan. In the afternoon, the joint meeting of the Criminal Law Committee and the Grain Committee reviewed the draft regulations on punishing crimes against grain management.

The Land Administration Committee discussed the proposal put forward by Fan Yuansheng and others to implement the policy of land price appreciation for public benefit in important cities. Some committee members supported the proposal, while others advocated increasing the current land appreciation tax rate and opposed the separate proposal. Finally, it was decided to report to the Legislative Yuan that there are many cases related to land issues, and this case should also be handled together. The two opinions, both supporting and opposing, should be submitted at the same time for the Legislative Yuan to consider.

### China's Anti-Communist War

By Lai Lian

Today, Eastern Europe behind the Iron Curtain has been controlled by Moscow, and other countries in the world are also under the threat of communism. China has been engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for over twenty-five years. Although we have suffered the destruction and disasters caused by the Communist Party, we are confident that in these twenty-odd years of struggle, China has become the vanguard of anti-communism, and the Soviet Union's conspiracy to communize Asia has not yet succeeded in its entirety.

Today, in my capacity as a member of the Standing Committee of the Kuomintang and representing the Chinese people, my defense of China and the Kuomintang is not an attempt to gloss over our faults or deceive friendly nations. China has been invaded by imperialism and has experienced turmoil for over a century. After the eight-year War of Resistance, it suffered a great loss of vitality. The Communist bandits then launched a large-scale military rebellion at this time. Transportation was destroyed, industry and mining were destroyed, cities were looted, and people were massacred, creating unprecedented tragedy and terror in history. The responsibilities borne by the Chinese government and the difficulties it has encountered (as you Americans can imagine if you put yourself in our shoes).

We do not deny that administrative efficiency has not reached the ideal expectations, nor can we deny the decline in production, the withering of people's livelihood, and the general deterioration of the economic situation. However, most of these phenomena were caused by the Communist bandits and are part of the overall plan of Communist International to create poverty, hunger, war, and disaster. This is an ironclad fact, and no matter how good the Communist bandits and their foreign supporters are at propaganda, they cannot deny it.

Some people have been influenced by the Communist bandits' propaganda and think that there should be no more "civil war" in China. In fact, China, like the United States, is a nation that loves peace. If it were not for the Communist bandits acting as accomplices and instigating war, we would never have turned against each other and killed each other. Today, China's resistance to red imperialism cannot be called a civil war. China's struggle is, on the one hand, to seek survival for the nation and independence for the country, and at the same time, it is the most important link in the world's anti-red front. If China were to succumb to red imperialism, the stabilizing force in the Far East would immediately be shaken, and a third world war could break out at any time. If you understand this principle, you will no longer say that China's anti-communist war is a civil war.

We regret the failure of the Marshall Mission. However, if we had accepted the Communist bandits' conditions at that time and established a coalition government, China would have become a second Poland or Czech Republic long ago. The United States now knows that the Communist Party cannot be trusted, but we have had twenty-five years of painful experience. The Kuomintang knew the seriousness of the Communist Party problem twenty years ago, so it once attracted them to join the Kuomintang in order to eliminate the scourge in its infancy. Unexpectedly, after they joined, they harbored evil intentions and conspired to seize power. They implemented the infiltration policy implemented by the American Communist Party today in a meticulous and step-by-step manner. I returned to China from the United States in 1926 and personally witnessed the Communist bandits first expressing cooperation with various moving slogans, and even publicly pledging allegiance to the Kuomintang. Then, on the one hand, they infiltrated party and government agencies with their important members, seized key positions, and on the other hand, they sent their party members to infiltrate all levels of society, farmers, workers, and other groups, clamoring wildly, creating terror, and disrupting order in order to achieve the goal of seizing power. If it were not for President Chiang's foresight and decisive elimination of the Communist bandits, the Kuomintang would have been wiped out twenty years ago!

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States mistakenly believed that the Communist bandits could be compromised, so there were suggestions of political consultation, military mediation, and even a coalition government. General Marshall's visit to China was to carry out this mission. Marshall was highly respected and admired by the world, and China needed peace and construction, so everyone warmly welcomed Marshall's visit to China, and the government was especially willing to cooperate sincerely and adopt various suggestions.

The Communist bandits insist on the established view of world revolution and will never sincerely compromise with anyone. When their power is weak, they use sweet words to deceive the world. Once their feathers are full, they can betray all promises, sell friends, and sell the country without hesitation. In their minds, there is no concept of law, let alone moral standards. Therefore, the Communist bandits should bear full responsibility for the failure of the Marshall Mission. In fact, the Communist bandits have no sincerity to speak of. Moscow had already decided to undermine it when Marshall's work began. Their strategy: (1) To delay time in order to expand and strengthen the Communist bandits' military position. (2) To provoke the relationship between China and the United States. (3) To place the responsibility for the failure of the negotiations on the government.

We have always regarded President Roosevelt as a friend of China. However, after Germany surrendered, he made a misjudgment on Japan and used the basic rights and interests of the Northeast, which are related to China's survival, as exchange conditions for the Soviet Union to send troops to attack Japan, and satisfied Stalin's imperialist ambitions. As a result, the railway rights were completely lost, and Lushun and Dalian existed in name only. Outer Mongolia was formally recognized as independent. On the one hand, the Soviet Union delayed the date of troop withdrawal, and on the other hand, it dismantled industrial and mining equipment worth US$2 billion. At the same time, it armed the Communist bandits and caused endless chaos, which not only harmed China's survival, but also threatened the security of the United States, destroyed peace in the Far East, and harmed China, the United States, and the whole world. I am not afraid of being verbose and describe this historical error because I want the United States to be vigilant. Today, this scourge is still expanding, and the United States' foreign policy and its policies towards China and the Soviet Union are still hesitating and undecided. I really cannot but worry about the future of the world.

The Communist bandits themselves say that they have no direct relationship with the Soviet Union, and they also claim to be a political party engaged in land reform. In fact, the Communist bandits are a disaster for the country and the people, and can only be called traitors, rebels, or the fifth column. The so-called land reform is nothing more than confiscating all the land in their occupied areas and massacring the peasants who cannot obey them.

Some people think that the Communist bandits have developed rapidly and seem to have gained the support of the people. In fact, the people in their occupied areas are all prisoners without freedom or security. They are driven to fight at any time, or they are enslaved, or they are massacred on the pretext. They use coercion to force people to become soldiers, so they do not have to worry about the lack of soldiers. They also use looting to confiscate people's property, so they do not have to worry about the lack of financial resources. However, the people under their iron-fisted rule are no better than cattle and horses!

I have dealt with the Communist bandits for more than twenty years, and I know their ambitions, strategies, organizational abilities, and propaganda techniques very well. Because I have been engaged in education for many years, I also know how the Communist bandits anesthetize young people and how they tempt young people to commit crimes and betray their motherland. I was the president of National Northwest University, which happened to be in Shaanxi with Mao Zedong's Yan'an government. They often sent party members to infiltrate the university, provoking emotions, inciting student unrest, and creating an atmosphere of terror and social unrest in the school. Fortunately, I took precautions and often stopped the turmoil in advance, so I was able to protect the safety of students and academic freedom.

China's resistance to the totalitarian ideology of communism hopes for the active assistance of friendly countries, but it never slackens its own efforts. No matter how serious the difficulties it encounters, it still moves towards the road of democracy and constitutionalism. The constitution was promulgated the year before last, and a popularly elected government was established this year. I am a member of this popularly elected Legislative Yuan. We know that the current enemy is even more ferocious than Japan, but we will never be discouraged, and we firmly believe that the Communist bandits will fail and China's future is full of light and hope.

In terms of economics, China dares to innovate its monetary system and suppress prices in this difficult time. In less than a month, it has achieved remarkable results. This shows that China is determined to be self-reliant. We believe that from now on, finance can be stabilized and people can live in peace.

Our national construction plan is being implemented step by step in accordance with the Three Principles of the People, especially the Principle of People's Livelihood, which can be called a peaceful and progressive socialism. We advocate restricting capital while protecting private enterprises. We advocate equalizing land rights while allowing private individuals to retain land. The facilities of the British Labour Party are in line with what the Kuomintang advocates. You know that the British Labour Party is a strong force in Europe resisting the Communist Party, so you know that only the Kuomintang's socialist economic policy can eliminate the scourge of the Communist bandits and resist Soviet aggression.

The United States has learned that under the continued offensive of communism, not only is the situation in Berlin becoming increasingly tense, but also the underground work and infiltration policies of its party members make everyone feel that their safety and survival are greatly threatened, and no country is exempt. However, the general perception is still to belittle the crisis of the redization of Asia. Even the peripheral organizations of the Communist Party openly declare that even if the Communist Party obtains political power in China, it will not affect the United States. This is a vicious propaganda instructed by the Soviet Union, and we must expose its conspiracy so that the United States will not be deceived again.

For more than twenty years, the Communist International has never neglected Asia, especially China, which has been plagued by disasters. It has been painstakingly planning and doing everything possible. Asia has long been invaded by Western imperialism, and the living standards of the people are not very high, while the ideology of nationalism is spreading everywhere. In Korea, in Annam, in Burma, in Thailand, in Malaysia, in Indonesia, and even in India, Japan, and the Philippines, Communist propaganda has made considerable progress. It is precisely because China is still able to annihilate the Communist bandits and resist the Soviet Union that the security of Southeast Asian countries can still be maintained. If China is conquered by Moscow, the entire Asia will immediately be redized, and this population of more than 1 billion can be used by the Soviet Union. All Soviet-style intimidation, fraud, terror, and massacres will spread around the world, and democratic politics and modern civilization may be destroyed at any time. I don't know what the United States will do then!

The United States does not want another war, just like China. However, the Communist International insists on enslaving the people of the world with its totalitarian ideology. Anyone who does not bow to its will is regarded as reactionary, stubborn, or a war profiteer. Any appeasement policy can never win peace from the hands of the Communist Party, and at most can only exchange it for the fate of a Beneš or a Masaryk of the Czech Republic.

Today, the only country in the world that truly has the strength to confront the Soviet Union in politics, economics, and military affairs is this wealthy and prosperous United States. However, the American people are fair, respect the law, and do not want war. The Soviet Union uses this weakness of the United States to repeatedly launch attacks on European and Asian countries, either through military force or through propaganda, or by using the veto power in the United Nations, or by instructing the Communist Parties of various countries to betray their motherland and create chaos. The methods used vary from time to time and from place to place, but the ultimate goal is to force other countries to accept the political ideology and style of the Soviet Union. In other words, it wants to conquer the world and enslave mankind with its communism. When the whole of Europe is disarmed and China loses its ability to resist, the United States will be isolated. Even if it has abundant resources and atomic weapons, it may be unable to do anything. Although the United States does not want war, war will inevitably be forced to its doorstep. Has the United States forgotten the lessons of the two world wars?

The Soviet Union has the ambition of world revolution and has a set of interconnected conspiracies against Europe, Asia, and the United States. If the United States does not have a far-sighted and firm world policy to counter it, all democratic and free countries will be swallowed up and defeated one by one, and the United States will not be spared in the end. Today, the United States' attention is entirely on Europe. In fact, the Soviet Union has already taken the initiative in Europe, and is also actively directing a gradually expanding human tragedy in Asia. I don't have to say that Asia is more important than Europe, but the seriousness of the situation in Asia is even greater than that in Europe. The United States must have a comprehensive plan to counter the Soviet Union's conspiracy, and give equal importance to Europe and Asia, and balance East and West in order to face reality and save the crisis.

In short, the situation in the Far East is of great importance to the balance of world power, and the security, peace, and prosperity of the Far East depend on the close cooperation between China and the United States. Our common interests and mutual understanding are the basis of this cooperation. If we can get your help, we can make the United States have a deeper understanding of the Chinese problem, and we can enable China to achieve the goal of strength and democracy. A strong and democratic China is a guarantee of the common interests of China and the United States, and it is also the cornerstone of lasting world peace.

### Sharp Reduction in Maritime Civil Aviation in Northern Jiangsu and Shanghai, Grain Supply in Peiping and Tianjin Affected, Peiping to Exchange Cloth for Grain in the Suburbs

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 16th] Peiping has started exchanging 5,000 bolts of cloth for grain in the suburbs. The sharp reduction in maritime civil aviation in the north and south has greatly affected grain prices in Peiping and Tianjin. The post office has announced that it has stopped accepting sea freight parcels, and those to Shanghai should all be changed to air freight. The other day, a ship carrying flour arrived in Tianjin, but because it was urgently needed for military use, it was unable to unload completely, and loaded the remaining 40,000 bags and hurriedly returned south. The Tianjin Municipal Government yesterday telegraphed Director Weng about the black market prices, stating that the price of cornmeal needed by the people of Peiping has exceeded the price limit tenfold. Peiping also reported to Zhang Lisheng. The Xidan Shopping Mall opened its doors this afternoon under police patrol, but it is uncertain whether customers will buy goods at the price limit. Merchants are in a state of fear. Restaurants in the Jinshifang Street area of Xicheng have mostly "fortified themselves" and put up "internal repairs" signs as a shield because they are often visited by customers who "eat and leave."

National banks are promoting the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks in Hankou, Chongqing, Xiamen, and Xi'an.
〔Report from our newspaper〕The voting for state-owned enterprises has already been issued and sold in the five major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Pingjin. As of the 15th of this month, a total of 4,209,100 shares have been sold. It is learned that in order to promote sales, the Central Bank's Treasury Department has also handed over the voting and receipt data for the five regions to China National Aviation Corporation for distribution to its branches in Qingdao, Hankou, Chongqing, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Kunming, and Xi'an, and will also dispatch personnel to Chengdu and Shenyang in the near future for distribution.
It is also learned that the Taiwan Bank, entrusted by the Central Bank to sell the stocks of Taiwan Sugar and Taiwan Paper companies in the province, has reported that sales in Taipei began on the 13th. Sales in Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung are scheduled to begin on the 18th, and in Hualien and Keelung on the 22nd.

### Export of goods from this city can be applied for legally, but price increases or hoarding are not allowed.
Yesterday, the responsible persons of the cotton cloth, cotton yarn, oil, sugar, and other trade associations in Beijing and Shanghai held a joint meeting at the Central Bank, presided over by Secretary Cai of the Economic Supervision Office. Mr. Cai stated that the transportation of goods from this city to other areas can be applied for according to the "Measures for Applying for the Export of Prohibited Goods." However, there is one principle: after the transported goods arrive at their destination, they must absolutely comply with the price limits of August 19 and are not allowed to exceed them or hoard them for resale.
Furthermore, according to Mr. Dong Jiufeng, Chairman of the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, the inventory of cotton cloth in Shanghai is very large, with over 7 million bolts currently under investigation by various factories and cloth shops. At present, the Shanghai cotton cloth industry can still produce up to 4 million bolts per month. The supervisors have now decided to allow the cotton cloth industry to export between 2 million and 3 million bolts per month to meet the needs of various regions.

### Export industry faces many difficulties; regular membership meetings will be convened to collect opinions and find ways to improve.
After the implementation of the new economic policy, the export of goods has become difficult due to loose credit and speculative purchases, resulting in market prices that are ostensibly stable but actually firm. In order to broadly solicit the difficulties encountered by colleagues in the import and export industry in their business operations and find ways to overcome them, it has been decided to convene a membership meeting next Tuesday. After collecting the opinions of all members, improvement measures will be formulated and submitted to the relevant authorities for reference and implementation.
Since the currency reform, due to the failure to thoroughly implement management work in the interior, the export prices of commodities in various production areas have risen, and the export industry has been observing from the sidelines due to high costs, resulting in a recent decline in exports. The Export Management Committee has been closely monitoring this situation and has convened meetings with various export industries in this city to inquire about the difficulties encountered and resolve them individually. Those that cannot be resolved will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for reference.

### Joint Allocation of Yarn to Private Factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai
〔Report from our newspaper〕The cotton spinning associations of private factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai yesterday conducted the third joint allocation of yarn for the sixth period, allocating 1,025 bales of 20-count yarn. The total amount of cotton cloth opened for sale by various factories was 9,675 bolts, equivalent to 205 bales of 20-count yarn.

### The Textile Construction Company Distributes Cloth as Usual
Yesterday, the yarn market remained suspended, but retail sales of yarn in the Jinling Road area were still booming. Due to the scarcity of inventory, each person was allowed to purchase only half a bale upon presentation of their identification card. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company distributed cotton cloth as usual, a total of seven types. Those who applied for (dyed fine cloth) were limited to 38.5-inch 12-pound fine cloth and two types of vice-brand serge. (Price listed in the market price list) Those who (cloth shops at the door) were allocated 12-pound B fine cloth, Taoyuan Garden fine cloth, second-grade 42-inch Four Gentlemen bleached cloth, and five types of plain serge and plain straight tribute cloth. There was also American 001 printed cloth priced at one yuan per meter, 003-014 four-color poplin priced at one yuan per meter, and 003-022 dotted printed cloth priced at 90 cents per foot (limited to one type per household). Many people applied.

### Food Rice Arrives Continuously; Trading Method Is No Longer Based on Viewing Samples and Negotiating Prices
Yesterday, a total of 1,925.15 dan (石) of food rice arrived in the North and South markets, including 840.65 dan handled by brokers in the South Market, 147.5 dan by rice shops, 513 dan handled by brokers in the North Market, 83 dan by rice shops, and 340 dan by rice mills. The food rice that arrived was either sold directly in stores (shops and mills) or sold on the market. Rice shops could only purchase goods from suppliers with whom they had close relationships, so transactions were not based on viewing samples and negotiating prices as before.
The miscellaneous grains market was almost completely inactive yesterday. Finally, 40 bags of Nanjing snow sesame were purchased by this street, with two bags per household, priced at 30 yuan. Some people in this street were unable to purchase any and left disappointed. Corn, naked barley, and shelled peanuts were not available at all. The second registration for soybeans began yesterday, so there were also no sales.

### Silk Trading Is Quiet
The raw silk market situation remains very quiet. The quantity distributed by the guild is decreasing daily, and journalists feel that it is insufficient. Due to restrictions at silk shops, there is no way to expand sales, and the market sentiment is firm. Under the price limit, there is no raw silk available on the market. Foreign firms and silk manufacturers have a strong desire to purchase, but holders are watching from the sidelines and not taking action, resulting in no transactions for either domestic or export goods.
In recent days, customer sales have been active, but silk factories are mostly not producing due to difficulties in obtaining raw materials. However, due to the strict inspections by the authorities in recent days, holders are uneasy and selling off goods in the market, mostly unpopular items.

### Sugar Market Is Firm
Yesterday, the sugar market softened slightly because the Taiwan Sugar Company distributed the 23rd batch of box sugar. Sales in this street have been active in recent days, and demand is high, but the quota is limited, so many people are applying. Although the market trading has been changed to a public sales system, people in the industry are still uneasy.

### Cotton Market Is Stable
There were slightly more cotton transactions yesterday, and some new cotton from the suburbs also arrived. Small-scale yarn factories with low inventories are in great need. There were a few transactions of Zhoupu seed cotton in accordance with the limits.

### Tea Market Trading Is Limited
Domestic tea trading remained limited yesterday because, in addition to this street and the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area, there were still purchases, but transportation to Tianjin and other areas in the north was difficult, and Shenzhuang had long since stopped trading. Therefore, the rate of sales has slowed. However, current holders still have some inventory, so supply and sales are fairly average, and the process is still strong. As for the foreign tea market, both imports and exports are rare, and the market is quiet. It is reported that exporters are currently examining the Qimen black tea, which is most loved by the British, and will likely negotiate with sellers next Monday.

### Statistics on Paper Inventory in Shanghai
According to the Shanghai Paper Trade Association registration office, as of October 12, the actual inventory of paper was as follows: 27,918 reams and 340 sheets of newspaper, 428 rolls of rolled newspaper, 221 reams and 85 sheets of waste newspaper, 770 reams and 163 sheets of domestic newspaper, 1,156 reams of 24x36 newspaper, 11 reams of 25x44 newspaper, 10,599 bundles, 5 knives, and 183 sheets of domestic native-made rough-edged paper, and 18,247 reams and 90 sheets of domestic machine-made rough-edged paper.

### Social Service: Unemployed for Three Years, Livelihood in Despair; Urgently Seeking Employment and Hoping for Sympathetic Assistance
Dear Editor,
It is now one o'clock in the morning. Having been unable to eat my fill for many days, I am supporting my frail body and writing this letter to you with trembling hands. In recent months, the cold and harsh winds from relatives and friends, and the ubiquitous walls in society, have driven me to the brink of life. What else do I have to be nostalgic for in this world? Now I am placing all my hope in you. I hope to receive assistance from you so that I can continue to struggle on the journey of life.
I have been a loyal reader of your newspaper for more than ten years. Before the war, I was a civil servant. During the war of resistance, I followed the government westward. I endured all kinds of hardships and always adhered to my position, fulfilling my duty as a citizen.
Because I am not good at flattery and bootlicking, I finally suffered the misfortune of unemployment due to the reorganization of the agency in the year of victory.
Three years have passed quickly, and I have not yet found a place to settle down. As I write this, my young child is crying because he cannot suck milk from his mother's shriveled breasts. My heart is about to burst, and I feel a surge of darkness before my eyes.
I can type in English, write in Chinese, and have a basic understanding of accounting. I hope to find a job to support my wife and children.
I await your reply with the utmost urgency. Wishing you peace.
Sincerely,
Zou Honglie

### Postal Q&A
We have received inquiries from (1) Mr. Jiang Zihua, (2) "A Citizen" of this city (21), and (3) Mr. Lou Yongda. We provide brief answers to the points raised below:
Answer: (1) (2) (A) Due to the vastness of the urban area of this city, the same-day delivery area for letters does not yet include Nanshi, Zhabei, and remote areas. Your residence at Xietu Road (from Luban Road to Xinqiao Road) in this city (21) is located in the Nanshi area, so it is not within the current delivery area, which is still to be expanded. (B) Mail is delivered there twice a day, at 8:30 AM and 2:00 PM. Because that location is at the end of the relevant delivery section, the mail arrives later, around 11:00 AM in the morning and around 4:00 PM in the afternoon. (3) After the postal box at the bridge approach on North Tibet Road was damaged, a new box is being manufactured to replace it. However, because the structure of the box is not simple, it will take some time to complete, and it is expected that it will be installed soon.

### Reorganization of Zhongyuan Institute of Technology: Students Petition the Ministry of Education Again; Vice Minister Hang Says Assistance Will Be Provided if Procedures Are Followed
〔Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th〕Over sixty students from the private Henan Zhongyuan Institute of Technology, including Zheng Heguang, again petitioned the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 16th.
Upon hearing the news, the Eastern District Police Department of the Capital Police Department dispatched police officers to post a notice from the police department in front of the Ministry of Education building, stating that the students had repeatedly gathered to petition in a coercive manner, and that the department could not remain silent in its official capacity and ordered the students to immediately disperse in accordance with Article 149 of the Criminal Law. At the same time, eight legislators from Henan, including Yang Yifeng, were elected by all the legislators from Henan Province to come to the ministry to discuss important matters. They discussed the matter with the Ministry of Education and requested that Vice Minister Hang address the students at 5:00 PM. Vice Minister Hang stated that the Zhongyuan Institute of Technology had not been registered, and the students' academic status was problematic. Considering that they were displaced and out of school, the ministry set up a tutoring class in Zhenjiang to provide relief tutoring. They could take the university entrance examination themselves during the winter vacation, and if admitted, they would be given convenience and their academic status would be recognized. For the remaining students who were not admitted during the winter vacation, tutoring would be extended within a possible range so that they would have the opportunity to take the entrance examination after the summer vacation. Furthermore, the Henan Provincial Government had previously proposed to convert the school into a provincial school. As long as the reorganization plan and budget were processed according to the procedures, the Ministry of Education would provide convenience and assistance. Legislator Yang Yifeng then explained the position of the Ministry of Education to the students, advising them to return and ask Chen Zhiling, a director of the school who came to Beijing, to promote the conversion to a provincial school as soon as possible through proper channels. The students dispersed in the evening.

### National Education Office Inspects National Schools

### Normal College in Beiping Reverted to University: Approved by the Political Affairs Conference
〔Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th〕Regarding the restoration of the Beiping Normal College to a normal university, Vice Minister Hang told reporters that it was carefully discussed at the Political Affairs Conference on the morning of the 16th. President Weng and the Political Affairs Committee members believed that the normal university had its history and achievements in the past, and the current departments also had the scale of a university, which was different from newly established or reorganized universities. Therefore, they unanimously decided to approve the restoration of the original name. The government's decision not to establish new universities in the near future remains in effect.

Free Talk: Losing Out? A Bargain? Subei
In recent weeks, it is said that the situation on the market has changed dramatically, but my sense of economics has always been slow, and my pockets are extremely empty, so I have not considered whether to join the "squeeze" to enjoy the due rights given by the identity card; people's identity cards have long been covered with imprints, but mine is still as white as before.
But today, when I occasionally strolled into the bustling downtown area, I was squeezed by the crowd and had no place to stand; looking at the pedestrians on the road, they were all carrying large bags, their hands were not empty, and the stores were a thousand times more prosperous than in the past; this was like the scene of everyone rushing to buy New Year's goods around 1937. However, what is strange is that the shop assistants are all listless, as if they are overwhelmed by the customers, and the windows only have a little bit of decoration left. After a while, before the sun has set, the bosses are already wearing stern faces and issuing eviction orders.
I stood in front of a store for more than ten minutes, my mind beginning to think and answer myself for a long time. Isn't it said that most people are so poor that it is difficult to make a living? But looking at the scene today, who would believe it? At least everyone has the spare capacity to hoard non-essential goods. Do you ridicule them? They all boast of the appropriateness and cleverness of their "emergency measures," because they say that this way they won't lose out!
"Losing out," "a bargain," people are born into this world, busy all day mostly to strive for the latter; sometimes you go to a distant store to buy an item, and it turns out to be cheaper by ten cents or a few cents, and you feel greatly comforted, even if it doesn't immediately make you feel relaxed and fat, at least it can improve your appetite, which shows that the love of "a bargain" is the same for everyone. However, he obviously did not know that the consumption of time, physical strength, and transportation costs is enough to turn a bargain into a loss!
The current situation is once again when people choose to lose out or get a bargain. People think that buying things will never be a loss, and if everyone else buys and I don't, wouldn't that be terrible? So: men, women, old, and young, the whole family is mobilized to squeeze and buy, buying whatever they can; as a result, in an instant, the bosses' nerves are passively tensed up, and the things in the windows continuously run out the back door, you insist on buying, I refuse to sell, you refuse to sell, then I must search and buy, squeeze and buy. This cycle has caused goods that were once in excess of demand to suddenly become in short supply, and once demand exceeds supply, the consequences are obvious.
People think they have gotten a bargain, but they didn't think that this bargain will obviously force the price limit defense line to collapse. Even if it is said that the price limit must eventually change, then people's self-proclaimed "bargain" measures have advanced the price limit change by a certain amount of time. The foolishness of selfish people has found the most standard example here!

Beggars' Ways Song Xian
There are many tricks for beggars to beg for food. As far as I know, there are "bodyguards," "scholars," "painted faces," "filial sons," and so on.
There is a kind of beggar who always follows behind people, constantly calling "Mr." and "Madam," following them for several blocks without stopping. They are called "bodyguards." They hold a fan in their hands in the hot weather and wave it behind passersby. On rainy days, they will even ingratiatingly remind pedestrians to be careful of the puddles ahead.
The "colleagues" of beggars who prostrate on the road and lodge complaints are called "scholars." Those who squat on the sidewalk, kowtow, gesticulate, and shout loudly are called "painted faces." Their status among beggars is the lowest, and they are generally recognized as "cheap goods."
"Filial sons" often bring an old and frail old father or mother with them. These "parents" are all "rented." They have to pay a sum of "rent" every day, and he leads or carries the old man, arousing pity and thus receiving a lot of alms. It is said that if these "filial sons" are skilled, their income is not bad.
Those who sing Taoist songs are called "Fang Qing." Those who perform hard martial arts are called "Martial Scholars." Their "kung fu" is truly amazing: swallowing iron pellets, piercing chains, or inserting a two-foot-long iron sword straight into their throats. They can pick up any table or chair at the entrance of any store and balance it on the tip of their nose without it falling. These "arts" cannot be performed brilliantly without a lot of hard work.
There are also blind, rotten-legged, lame, and dumb people, etc., whose pretenses are even more numerous, but it is not easy to pretend to be lifelike. Those who pretend to have rotten legs have to apprentice and be taught, they have to eat "living" and endure having a layer of "rotten flesh" stuck to their feet. Those who pretend to be blind have to close their eyes and constantly shout "Save the blind." It is not easy to endure for a whole day. But for the sake of livelihood, they don't care.
Their lives are low enough. In addition to receiving a little alms that passersby disdain, they are only the ridicule of society. But the society that should be ridiculed is this one. Only in a society that should be ridiculed are there these "ridiculed" pitiful people!

### Sending My Youngest Daughter, Zhenhun, to Beijing for Marriage, Written Upon Arriving at Xiaguan
Sending My Youngest Daughter, Zhenhun, to Beijing for Marriage, Written Upon Arriving at Xiaguan
Only because the children's aspirations are not yet fulfilled, it is not by public transport that I go to Beijing, the world situation has changed several times, the rivers and mountains still laugh at my watching.
Watching the ever-changing clouds and smoke is tiring, only feel that the dragon's coiled posture is still high, a guest in green robes comes again today, smiling at the mountain spirits, wanting to be proud.
Meeting He Maishu in Nanjing
Although we are not talking about the current situation of turmoil and separation, I feel countless emotions when I meet you today, but I am happy that Jiangnan is still a beautiful scene, the old people are still safe, like Li Guinian.
The night before Zhenhun went to Beijing to marry, someone asked for a painting and offered a reward of one hundred million gold, if it could be used as a dowry, I casually wrote a poem to relieve my self-deprecation
Xiao Cao's family background was originally poor, the skirt was made of cloth, and the hairpin was made of branches and thorns, frugally preserved, if there is one hundred million gold for the dowry, people will laugh at me as a rich family

### Under the Glass Plate Yanzhi
Our people often talk about "observing people in the small," saying that those who do not touch the ground with their heels when walking are certainly frivolous, and those who sit with their bodies crooked are certainly not upright, and so on, with many tricks. Although these things have no scientific basis, they often still play a very important role in recruiting employees or interviewing students. Schools only teach students geometry and trigonometry, but never teach "walking posture" or "sitting posture," which is truly a pity. Some young people, when looking for a job, are fortunate enough to be summoned by the company manager, and often, in addition to joy, they are secretly anxious, fearing that they will temporarily "lose their manners" and create a bad impression, causing their great hopes to become a bubble - the reason why they panic is partly because they all know that there are many people in society who claim to be able to "observe people in the small." If there is a heart of panic, naturally they become shy at that time, their faces also turn red, and their speech is also hesitant, obviously having ability and enthusiasm, but others see them as "too young" - when encountering misfortune, the comment is actually "young and inexperienced," and then it's bad.
Making too early a judgment with a hasty glance will undoubtedly not lead to a correct conclusion. Therefore
