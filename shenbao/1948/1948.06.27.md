After this great calamity, it will be difficult for Biancheng [Kaifeng] to return to its former state within thirty years. General Liu expressed his intention to enter Bian alongside the army, and affirmed that the Henan Provincial Government would not relocate elsewhere.

### Explanation of the Reasons and Process for Publishing Minister He's Report

Spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan Provides Explanation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] When a reporter asked the spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan today about "Minister He Yingqin's report on the recent Central Plains War at the temporary closed-door meeting of the Yuan on the 24th, since it was of a confidential nature and not allowed to be disclosed, why did the Secretariat of the Yuan publish it?", the spokesperson replied: "Minister He's report was delivered to the Secretariat of this Yuan by the Ministry of National Defense on the afternoon of the 25th, along with a letter stating that 'the content published in the Xinmin Bao is significantly different from the original report. To avoid the spread of misinformation, we have specially organized the entire report and request that you publish it on our behalf.'" The Secretariat of this Yuan, except for slightly omitting the confidential parts of the entire report, acceded to Minister He's request and published the original manuscript, intending to correct the erroneous records and prevent the spread of misinformation. The spokesperson also stated: "News reporters have the right to report any news, as long as they do not disclose military secrets."

However, official sources have solemnly stated that such speculation is premature.

### The Draft Provisional Property Tax Regulations Have Been Completed by the Legislative Yuan's Subcommittee; The Threshold for Inheritance Tax Awaits a Decision by the Full Yuan

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The Legislative Yuan's Committee on Finance and Banking and the Subcommittee on Provisional Property Tax and Investigation of the Capital of Powerful Families held a meeting on the afternoon of the 26th to continue discussing the draft Provisional Property Tax Regulations. Jian Guansan, the chairman, first had Jiang Yiping represent the three-member subcommittee, designated by the external committee, report the results of their research on the levy of the provisional property tax on foreigners' property. They concluded that there were practical difficulties and it would be difficult to implement. The meeting then began to discuss and amend Chapters 7 and 8, "Penalties" and "Supplementary Provisions," with the following key points: (1) Those who fail to declare their property within the prescribed period according to the tax levy procedures shall be fined 50% of the tax payable. (2) Those who falsely conceal their property with the intention of evading taxes shall be fined from one to three times the tax payable, and shall also be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not more than five years. (3) Those who fail to pay taxes within the prescribed period according to the tax levy procedures shall be fined 30% per ten-day period on the amount of tax owed, starting from the date of expiry. If the overdue period exceeds three months, it shall be enforced compulsorily. After the discussion of all eight chapters of the draft bill was completed, the meeting discussed again the tax rate issue of net asset value of profit-seeking enterprise, which had been retained in the previous meeting. Lu Yuwen reiterated at this point that legal persons should not be the subject of taxation, but this was still not supported by the attending members. Another amendment was passed, stipulating that if a profit-seeking enterprise is operated solely by an individual, or if it is not operated solely by an individual but the total number of shares of all shareholders of the enterprise and the net asset value of the enterprise and other property reaches the individual tax standard, then the individual's property shall still be taxed. As to whether the article governing the tax rate of the net asset value of profit-seeking enterprises will be canceled or revised due to this new regulation, it remains to be decided when the subcommittee reconvenes on the 28th. As such, it will be difficult for the Committee on Finance and Banking to submit a report to the full Yuan by the end of this month as scheduled. At the Yuan's meeting on the 29th, the committee will ask for an extension of several days on the grounds that the Yuan is carefully reviewing the bill.

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The Legislative Yuan's Committee on Finance and Banking, Committee on Economic Resources, and Committee on Civil Law held a joint meeting on the morning of the 26th, chaired by Wang Menglin, to review the draft amendment to the Inheritance Tax Law submitted by the Executive Yuan. There was a heated discussion on the threshold for inheritance tax. The original draft stipulated 50,000 yuan in the currency value of 1937. The committee members generally believed that this amount was too high and should be reduced. Finally, the amounts of 30,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan were put to a vote. Except for a few who supported 10,000 yuan, 30 members supported 20,000 yuan and 29 members supported 30,000 yuan. Neither number reached the majority of the 62 members present, so it was decided to submit these two amounts to the full Yuan to decide which one should be used as the threshold for inheritance tax.

### Control Yuan Urges Suppression of Price Hikes; No Measures Heard of for Daily Triple Increases; Request to the Executive Yuan for Reply to Corrective Actions

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The eleventh meeting of the first Control Yuan of the Constitution was held at 9:30 AM on the 26th, with Chairman Yu Youren presiding. After the Secretariat read out the minutes of the tenth meeting, the discussion began. The first item was a temporary motion submitted by Wang Guanwu and eleven other members: "Prices have been soaring recently, increasing three times a day. We have not heard of any effective measures being announced by the responsible Yuan departments. The Yuan should urgently send personnel to Beijing and Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation to remedy the situation, and also to pursue accountability." After this motion was put forward, several members agreed that it was necessary, starting with the investigation. It was then decided to designate the investigation committee during the meeting recess. However, when the meeting reconvened after the recess, the Secretary-General announced that the designated members were Jing Qingshen'an, Sun Yulin, Tao Baichuan of Shanghai, Yang Hu, Su Nibi, and Wang Guanwu. At that time, Sun Yulin stood up first to express his opposition, believing that we would not be able to propose solutions after sending personnel for investigation, and that the Yuan had previously submitted corrective actions to the Executive Yuan on the price issue, but there had been no follow-up. Now we can just have the Yuan send personnel to the Executive Yuan to inquire about the reply. Tian Jiongjin further believed that it was not necessary to send anyone, and that it would be enough to simply send a written inquiry. Su Nibi also spoke, believing that personnel should be sent to the Executive Yuan for investigation to inquire about the authorities' measures after the Yuan submitted the corrective actions, and that he did not approve of going to the Shanghai market for investigation. Zhang Dinghua said: "The duties of the Control Committee are to conduct its own investigations, and I do not approve of the assembly sending people to investigate the situation." Although Wang Guanwu stated that the motion had already been passed, it was finally decided to adopt Sun Wanglin's method and urge the Executive Yuan to reply to the corrective actions on suppressing price hikes. (The news that the eleventh meeting of the Control Yuan on the 26th passed a resolution dividing the country into 42 supervisory districts is published on page 2.)

### Experiencing Democracy Through Education

— Gao Shiliang

China has now entered the path of democratic constitutionalism. Reflecting on this past year, from the election of national representatives to the convening of the Legislative Yuan, countless farcical situations have arisen, making us deeply aware of the need to learn more from democratic countries. Therefore, from an educational standpoint, cultivating the democratic spirit and demeanor of young people should be listed as the central training of secondary and higher schools to lay the foundation for democratic politics. Because today's young students are the government officials, parliamentary members, national representatives, and voters of the future, they all bear the mission of establishing a democratic country. Therefore, how to guide them to become loyal officials and excellent citizens in the democratic era is indeed the inescapable responsibility of today's school teachers.

We cannot deny that the education in colleges and high schools after the implementation of the Constitution has not changed the previous erroneous concepts. In addition to teaching and grading papers, teachers can completely ignore students' extracurricular activities. How to cultivate students' democratic life has never been noticed by schools. Even the education authorities seem to have not considered what new methods and training should be adopted for students' autonomous activities in the future. This is the crux of the problem that today's Chinese education is out of touch with life and cannot meet the needs of the times.

The training of democratic life mainly lies in the sound student self-government organizations and activities. Currently, there are several abnormal phenomena in student self-government activities in secondary schools that must be corrected immediately. The first is that some students bury themselves in books all day long and have no interest in extracurricular activities. Although they pay membership fees and cast ballots at the beginning of each semester, they have never inquired about any facilities of the student union. They still have the naive thought of the autocratic era that "I work at sunrise and rest at sunset; what does the emperor's power have to do with me?" Another type of student is keen on leadership desire and has a sense of superiority, as if the student union cannot be organized without them coming out every semester. The entire student union is controlled by them. The small ones just show off their personal limelight, and the big ones use it to threaten the school and instigate student unrest. There is also a kind of student who forms factions, builds fortresses, gangs up with their own kind and attacks dissidents, and ensures that there are no opposing elements in the student union. These three phenomena all have a strong feudal color and have a very bad influence on the psychological behavior of young people, and should not appear in schools under the democratic system. Therefore, I believe that guiding student self-government organizations and activities should imitate the political system of progressive democratic countries as much as possible. There are governments, parliaments, and courts, each in charge of the power of administrative, legislative, judicial, and supervisory impeachment, and can strictly enforce their duties. The election of representatives at all levels and leaders of student unions should also be done through elections. Candidates participating in the election should put forward their policy platforms that can indeed seek benefits for the school (country) and classmates (people) to win the support of all classmates. As "voters," students must also put aside personal feelings and have firm confidence and judgment in the people they want to elect, truly achieving the point of "electing the virtuous and the capable."

Democracy cannot be separated from freedom, but freedom must have its limits, and must be accompanied by discipline, truth, and a spirit of cooperation, and must take the national interest as a prerequisite. In European and American countries, some have a two-party system, some have a three-party system, and some have a multi-party system. However, even though there is more than one party, their democratic system can gradually become stable because political parties may have different policies, but they are consistent in their national spirit. All interests of a democratic country should belong to the people, and the interests of the public cannot be ignored due to individual freedom. The British House of Commons has a long-standing motto: "Things that concern the public must have the permission of the public." Dean Inge (W. R. Inge) commented on the British attitude towards freedom, equality, and fraternity, saying, "Among these three slogans, we are more concerned with freedom, but we are prepared to sacrifice freedom in times of crisis." This kind of democratic accomplishment of the British can be said to be derived from school. Although our constitution has been promulgated, young students only have a superficial understanding of the true meaning of democratic freedom. Although democracy is not logically equivalent to freedom, it is also wrong for schools to give up eating because of choking, and not to reasonably guide students to use freedom and understand democracy. I believe that under the principle of not violating national interests, social order, and hindering school administrative measures, schools can allow students freedom in thought and action as much as possible, so that they can fully understand the meaning and scope of democratic freedom in actual life. When their thoughts and behaviors go beyond the norm and are subject to social and public criticism, they will naturally be vigilant and re-examine themselves. This kind of lesson learned from practical experience is very educational.

European and American countries pay great attention to the cultivation of sportsmanship and morality in schools to train excellent democratic spirits. Before the football game between Princeton University and Yale University in the United States, there is a ceremony similar to an oath-taking ceremony. The oath says: "We pray for victory, but we pray more to maintain clean actions." The British definition of sportsmanship is interpreted as "rejoicing in the victory of the opponent as if it were our own." The spirit of the British and Americans on the playing field is often manifested in the parliament. When Roosevelt won the election, the first congratulatory telegram came from Churchill, who failed in the election. In every sports meet in our country, athletes quarrel and fight. This is still unavoidable in this National Games. This kind of inferiority also needs to be corrected by school counselors and physical education teachers.

In our country's real environment, many people doubt whether China can implement democracy. However, the times can only move forward, not backward, and it also depends on whether we can make up our minds and work hard to achieve it. At the end of the nineteenth century, when Disraeli, the leader of the Conservative Party who had served as British Prime Minister, passed away, Gladstone, the Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, not only did not praise Disraeli's political achievements, but instead satirized him as someone who was loyal to the Jewish race and his wife. Tracing back to the beginning of the nineteenth century, President Andrew Jackson of the United States, in order to win over party members and meet their greedy demands, left behind the poison of the "spoils system." The phrase "to the victor belongs the spoils" used as a campaign slogan became a stain on the early democratic system of the United States. Over the past hundred years, if it were not for the politicians and educators in Britain and the United States who worked hard to rectify and transform it, especially the strict democratic training given in schools, there would not have been such achievements.

An excellent academic atmosphere can create an excellent political atmosphere. An excellent democratic style must be nurtured from schools. Russell said: "Tolerance and common sense are psychological habits that cannot be written into the constitution." We cannot but place high hopes on educators for cultivating the democratic spirit and demeanor of the next generation of citizens.

### The Control Yuan's Eleventh Meeting Passed the Division of Forty-Two Supervisory Districts; Establishment of Supervisory Committee Offices in Provinces with Special Circumstances to be Postponed

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 26th] In the eleventh meeting of the Control Yuan on the morning of the 26th, the original agenda was to discuss the draft of the Organic Regulations of the Supervisory Committee Offices. However, a temporary motion was made by Sun Yulin, Guo Changhe, and 30 others: "Regarding the discussion of Article 2 of the Organic Regulations of the Offices, we believe that the actual issue of establishing the offices should be resolved first, and then the articles should be discussed, which would be more appropriate. We have hereby drafted a form for the establishment of offices by districts and would like to submit it for discussion first. After a decision is made, we will discuss the articles based on the decision." After unanimous agreement, the motion was discussed first. The original number of office units listed was 31, with one office and one office branch, and two temporarily suspended. The actual number of offices to be established was 29. The discussion was very serious, to the point that there were mutual disputes. According to the original plan of the proposal, the areas were: Hebei, Tianjin, and Beiping would each have three offices. However, since Ping and Tianjin are close at hand, two offices have already been established, and Hebei Province would have another office. In terms of geography, it seems a bit excessive. However, Zhao Guangchen, a supervisory committee member elected from the Tianjin district, insisted that three offices must be established to facilitate the progress of the work. Guo Zhongwei stood up and loudly proclaimed that the draft had been discussed and reviewed several times, and there had been no results for three or four days. It could be said that everyone was thinking about their own interests and not prioritizing the interests of the country and the nation. As far as I am concerned, fewer offices should be established. At that time, Zhao Guangchen immediately went to the podium and said that now is the time of democratic constitutionalism, and everyone has the right to speak. Why is someone lecturing me? I do not accept lectures. Fortunately, this was just a momentary impulse, and the discussion continued. The meeting was adjourned before noon without completion.

The meeting continued at 3:30 pm to discuss the Organic Regulations of the Supervisory Committee Offices, and first discussed Sun Yulin's temporary proposal, which advocated first resolving the actual issue of establishing the offices. It took a long time, but was finally fully passed. It was decided to divide the country into 42 supervisory districts and establish supervisory committee offices, with one office. However, some of them are temporarily suspended due to banditry. For example, in the nine northeastern provinces, except for the establishment in Shenyang City, the rest are temporarily suspended. After the proposal was passed, the chairman immediately submitted the provisions of Article 2 of the draft Organic Regulations regarding the establishment of office areas for discussion. He asked the assembly for their opinion on whether it should be attached to the provisions of Article 2. Some people opposed it, believing that it should be stipulated by the Control Yuan itself, otherwise it might be revised after being sent to the Legislative Yuan. It was unanimously resolved that Article 2 be amended to: "The Control Yuan divides the country into several districts, and a supervisory committee office is established in each district. The establishment of the office shall be decided by a majority of all members present and a majority of those present." Subsequently, overseas Chinese supervisory committee members believed that offices should not be established overseas, and it should also be stipulated in the express text that personnel could be dispatched for investigation. A second item was added to Article 2: "The Control Yuan may dispatch personnel to investigate overseas embassies, consulates, and state-owned enterprises at any time." The discussion had gone beyond 6 pm, so it was announced that the meeting was adjourned, and the remaining articles would be discussed at the next meeting. The units for establishing offices by district are as follows: (1) Jiangsu, (2) Anhui, (3) Jiangxi, (4) Hunan, (5) Hubei Hankou City [established in Hankou or Wuchang], (6) Zhejiang, (7) Fujian, (8) Taiwan, (9) Yunnan, (10) Guizhou, (11) Western Sichuan (established in Chengdu), (12) Eastern Sichuan Chongqing (established in Chongqing), (13) Xikang, (14) Guangdong Guangzhou (established in Guangzhou), (15) Guangxi, (16) Henan, (17) Shandong Qingdao City (established in Jinan or Qingdao), (18) Hebei Beiping City (established in Beiping), (19) Tianjin, (20) Shanxi, (21) Shaanxi Xi'an City (established in Xi'an), (22) Gansu, (23) Qinghai, (24) Ningxia (the above three provinces will temporarily jointly establish the Gansu-Qinghai-Ningxia Office), (25) Xinjiang, (26) Rehe, (27) Chahar, (28) Suiyuan (the above three provinces will temporarily jointly establish the Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan Office), (29) Liaoning Province Shenyang City (established in Shenyang), (30) Andong, (31) Liaobei (establishment of the above two provinces to be postponed), (32) Jilin, (33) Songjiang Harbin City (establishment to be postponed), (34) Hejiang, (35) Heilongjiang, (36) Nenjiang, (37) Xing'an, (38) Dalian City (establishment of the above four provinces and one city to be postponed), (39) Tibet (establishment to be postponed), (40) Eastern Mongolia (established in Jinzhou), (41) Western Mongolia (established in Baotou), (42) Shanghai City. An office will be established within the Control Yuan in Nanjing City.

### The Slowly Exploding Atomic Bomb (Part 1)

— Wu Jiatang

If you travel to Tokyo today and survey public sentiment, you will surely believe that what has changed Japan's face are not two atomic bombs, but three! The first bomb, of course, is the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, and the second fell on Nagasaki. The third can be said to be a slowly exploding atomic bomb that overturned the entire social and political foundation of Japan. This bomb, though silent, has had a more profound impact on the Japanese people than the previous two historic atomic bombs, and its consequences are irreversible. If Japan's history can truly follow the path planned by the Allied Headquarters, the Japanese people will deeply feel the power of this third, invisible atomic bomb long after Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been rebuilt.

The author traveled to Japan twice before the war and knows the character of the Japanese people well. However, what I saw on my recent trip to Japan was a completely different country from the past, and the words and actions of the Japanese people were also very different from the past. In my opinion, the Japanese today are well aware that they are a conquered nation, and they know very well that their way of life and destiny are entirely in the hands of the Allied Headquarters. Although the Allied Headquarters does not use the cruel methods of the former Japanese military police to control the Japanese, the Japanese are able to thoroughly understand that their every move is under the strict control of the Allied forces.

After talking to all sorts of Japanese people, the most striking impression is that the lightning-fast reforms in Japan after the Allied occupation have left the general public at a loss and stunned. Not all of them understand the meaning of this change; most people are just living one day at a time, vaguely not knowing where to go. After returning home, someone asked me: Have the Japanese really changed? My frank answer is: To fundamentally change a nation, time is needed; three years is really too short. However, the basic policies for reforming Japan and the methods of implementation have been established and are being actively promoted. As for whether these reforms will continue after the Allied Headquarters withdraws from Japan, that is the responsibility of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other relevant countries. Someone also asked me: Is it possible for Japan to become a military threat to China again? My view is that, at present, our country has no reason to fear, and the possibility of militarist Japan rising again in the coming decades is also very small. However, I believe that unless our countrymen make the greatest effort to strive for self-improvement, even a small country like Siam will one day come to humiliate us. We have no reason to fear a disarmed Japan now, but we have reason to fear that we cannot strive for self-improvement.

From the Japanese perspective, everything in their universe has changed. In the government organization, the Emperor system has undoubtedly undergone the most severe evolution under the new constitution. Hirohito, who was the embodiment of God in the past, is now just an ordinary citizen. Under the Meiji Constitution, the Emperor was the sacred and inviolable leader of the Empire, holding the sovereignty of the nation and legislative power, being the supreme commander of the army and navy, and having the power to declare war, negotiate peace, and conclude treaties. But today, Hirohito's power has been stripped away completely. He is not even comparable to the English monarch in the position of nominal head of state. The new constitution has vested sovereignty in the Japanese people, and Hirohito's rights and obligations are no different from those of other citizens. Legislative power is in the hands of the Diet, and Hirohito can no longer enact laws as he did in the past, with the consent of the Diet and the Imperial Conference. The laws passed after the promulgation of the new constitution are laws and no longer the imperial edicts of the past.

Those who are familiar with Japan and have historical knowledge will surely understand the far-reaching significance of this change to the Japanese people. I believe that the evolution of the Emperor's position has made him an insignificant figure on the Japanese political stage. When I was in Tokyo, rumors circulated that Hirohito wanted to abdicate. Someone told me that Hirohito did have this idea and had almost decided to abdicate. In fact, given his current position, this issue is not a major one politically, because every Japanese person knows that as long as the Allied Headquarters slightly hints that Hirohito should abdicate, the Emperor system will immediately become a historical name in Japan.

I still remember the scene when I arrived in Tokyo in 1944, how the Japanese people bowed in front of the Imperial Palace. But on this trip to Tokyo, I saw many children playing baseball on the avenue in front of the main gate of the Imperial Palace. This meaningful scene is also sufficient to prove the changes in the lives and psychology of the Japanese people.

### British Military Commander in Germany Demands Soviet Union Lift Land Blockade of Berlin or Soviets Should Be Fully Responsible for Starvation in Germany; Berlin Municipal Government Plans to Ask United Nations to Intervene to Relieve People's Suffering

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 26th (Broadcast): Berlin dispatch, British Military Commander in Germany, Robertson, demanded today that the Soviet Union lift the land blockade of Berlin, otherwise the Soviet side should be fully responsible for the suffering of the Germans.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 26th (Broadcast): The British Foreign Office officially issued a statement today, strongly asserting that Britain will not withdraw from Berlin despite various ruthless obstructions by the Soviet side. Britain, the United States, and France are now conducting consultations separately in order to take joint action.

[Reuters London, 25th] The British Cabinet held three meetings within 24 hours. The Chief of Staff of the British Military Government in Germany, Brownjohn, was summoned from Berlin to London to present a report on the Berlin situation to the Cabinet. The Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office and Director of the German Department, Strang, also met with US Ambassador Douglas and French Ambassador Massigli today to discuss the Berlin situation.

[United Press Berlin, 25th] The Soviet Union announced on the 25th that the Soviet ban on train and automobile traffic to the Western zones of Germany will be lifted on the 28th. This ban has threatened 2.5 million Berlin residents with starvation. At the same time, the Soviet Union continues to enforce [the blockade], aiming to force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin, and has stopped importing bituminous coal into Berlin. The Soviet side claimed that the Soviet action was in retaliation for Britain's cessation of importing Ruhr anthracite coal into the Soviet zone. According to the Four-Power Agreement, the Soviet Union supplies Berlin with bituminous coal, and the Western countries supply the Soviet zone with anthracite coal.

[United Press Berlin, 26th] American planes began transporting milk and medicine to Berlin on the 26th to aid the 2.5 million Berlin residents.

[Reuters Berlin, 26th] Berlin Deputy Mayor Friedensburg declared that the Berlin Municipal Government will submit a document to the United Nations authorities, detailing the Berlin situation, including currency reform, electricity restrictions, unemployment caused by factory closures, and the threat of starvation faced by the Berlin people, in order to request the United Nations authorities to intervene to relieve the suffering of the Berlin people.

### US Considering How to Deal with Warsaw Conference; Plans to Make Further Probes with Soviet Union; Wants to Know If There Is Sincerity to Resume Negotiations with Germany

[Reuters Washington, 25th] US officials believe that the Warsaw Conference communique's request for the Four Powers to establish an agreement on Germany is intended to win over the German people. The communique did not state that the Soviet Union was the one preventing the resolution of the German problem, which clearly shows its propagandistic effect, so that the German people can attribute the current state of Germany to the Western Allies. US officials also believe that the recent Berlin events show that the Soviet Union wants to occupy the entire Berlin as the capital of the new East Germany. Observers believe that Marshall will soon confront Molotov and Stalin's peace offensive with an attitude of dealing with the Warsaw Conference, demanding that the Soviet Union put forward concrete and specific proposals to show its sincerity in resuming negotiations.

[Reuters Warsaw, 25th] The delegates from the eight Eastern European countries who participated in the Foreign Ministers Conference have departed from Warsaw today to return to their respective countries. Molotov arrived safely in Moscow on the evening of the 25th. According to Foreign Minister Clementis, he returned to Prague and gave a radio address from the Prague radio station that night. Although the communique of the Eight-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference requested the establishment of an all-German interim government, it is still widely rumored unofficially that the Soviet Union will establish an East German state, with its headquarters in Leipzig.

Observers here believe that the Eastern European Foreign Ministers can be certain that they have prepared a plan to take political and propaganda actions to deal with the Western powers' refusal to reopen the Four-Power German question negotiations. It is thought that the convening of this large-scale conference was definitely not just to draft the communique that was issued last night. Judging from the meaning of the communique, two interpretations are possible. The communique's insistence on reaching an agreement on the whole of Germany is still an attempt to reopen negotiations on a Four-Power basis; this is one. Otherwise, this is just a preliminary action to prepare public opinion to accept new measures regarding East Germany in the future; this is the second. If the Western powers agree to reopen Four-Power talks, their plans regarding West Germany will inevitably be temporarily shelved, giving the Soviet Union ample time to carry out its East German plans. If the Western powers refuse to resume Four-Power discussions, the Eastern European propaganda apparatus will launch an offensive, condemning the Western countries for splitting Germany. Observers are convinced that the five points announced in the communique of the Eight-Nation Conference are concealing the true nature of this meeting, and the establishment of an East German government must have been one of the main topics on the agenda.

### West Berlin Conserves Electricity and Food

[Reuters Berlin, 25th] The West Zone authorities have, starting today, implemented a reduction of 50 to 75 percent in the food and fuel rations to various industrial and military organizations. Also, since the British, American, and French zones of Berlin have been reduced in electricity supply, factories are only allowed to use 25 percent of their usual electricity consumption from today, and household current will also be stopped for twelve hours each day.

### West German Occupation Zone Permits East German Mark to Circulate

[United Press Berlin, 26th] US Military Commander in Germany, Howley, announced tonight that the new mark of the Western occupation zones and the currency issued by the Soviet Union are both legal tender in the US, British, and French occupation zones of Berlin. The Soviet Union had previously prohibited the use of the new currency of the Western occupation zones in the Soviet zone of Berlin, and those who violated it would be arrested.

[United Press Berlin, 26th] The Berlin Municipal Government passed a resolution yesterday, requesting that the Soviet Union and the Western Allied authorities allow the free circulation of both East and West Marks in the four zones of Berlin. Currently, the East German Mark can already circulate freely in the West Berlin zone, so the purpose of the request is only to ask the Soviet authorities to allow the West German Mark to circulate freely in the Soviet zone of Berlin. Also, many counterfeit notes have been discovered in the East German Mark issued by the Soviet authorities, which has stimulated the rise in black market prices.

### US Aid for Raw Material Allocation; China Gets Rice, Cotton, Flour

Totaling over US$25 million

[Reuters Washington, 26th] The Economic Cooperation Administration recently announced that the total value of raw materials and goods recently allocated to various recipient countries under the Foreign Aid Reconstruction Program is $730,783,903. China received flour worth $1,106,960, rice worth $11,620,040, and cotton worth $13,000,000. Among European countries, Britain received the most.

### Britain, France, etc., Express Dissent to Most-Favored-Nation Treatment for Japan; US Aid Bilateral Agreement Obstructed

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] According to well-informed sources, when Harriman led the US economic delegation to Japan to investigate its reconstruction and economic organization, he promised MacArthur that Japan would receive most-favored-nation treatment in the future. Therefore, the United States, Britain, France, Switzerland, and Denmark negotiated a bilateral agreement on the implementation of the Marshall Plan, and firmly insisted on including this point in the terms, which became a major obstruction.

Now, on other controversial issues, such as the control of European exchange rates and the granting of most-favored-nation treatment to Germany, most compromise solutions have been negotiated. It is now known that the former European countries will retain full sovereignty, and the latter requires the United States to grant Germany this treatment for a long period, while Britain and France firmly insist on a short period, and a compromise solution has been reached on this point.

### Other Relevant Terms Have Been Compromised

[Reuters Washington, 25th] US State Department and British spokesmen expect that a compromise solution to the bilateral agreement under the Marshall Plan can be reached within 24 hours. The State Department said it believes that the bilateral agreement between the United States and 16 European countries can be signed before the July 3 deadline. It is reported that compromise solutions have been reached on the following three points: (1) The clause that the United States has the right to request recipient countries to provide opinions on currency devaluation at any time has been deleted, but recipient countries must maintain an "effective" exchange rate; (2) The United States and each signatory country have the right to withdraw from the agreement with nine months' notice; (3) If the United States suffers losses due to the implementation of state-owned projects by the recipient country, the United States may appeal to the International Court of Justice for compensation, but it must do so after the country's courts have accepted and concluded the United States' appeal. It is reported that a clause on granting most-favored-nation treatment to Germany and Japan is still under negotiation.

### U.S. Republican Presidential Candidate Dewey's Full Speech — Establishing World Order Through Various Peaceful Means

[Special dispatch from the United States News Agency, Philadelphia, 25th] New York Governor Dewey, upon accepting the Republican nomination for president on Thursday evening, called for "efforts to establish a world order based on principles of fairness and justice through all peaceful means." As Dewey entered the convention hall, the delegates and attendees cheered like thunder.

The full text of Dewey's acceptance speech as a presidential candidate is as follows:

"I am deeply grateful for the favor and trust you Republicans have shown me by again nominating me as a candidate for President of the United States. At the same time, I keenly feel the weight of this responsibility. I accept your nomination. With a humble heart, I pray to God that I deserve this opportunity to serve the nation.

I come before you unbound by any obligations or promises, free to join you in selecting the nation's most outstanding men and women to serve the country, free to unite my party and my nation to meet the grave challenges of our time.

United, with deep understanding and a broad spirit, we can meet this challenge. This unity transcends mutual accusations, transcends party affiliation, and transcends selfishness. These are the principles that have shaped the greatness of America. Our nation is eager to see the power of this belief again. They place this belief at the heart of our national life, and this is what we must do, and what we will do.

At this historic convention, there are six other candidates who have participated in the presidential campaign. They are all people of noble thought, excellent character, talent, and loyalty to the country: Senator Baldwin, General MacArthur, Governor Stassen, Senator Taft, Senator Vandenberg, and Governor Warren. This is a challenging choice in a glorious competition. It is a moving expression of the life, vitality, and ideals of our Republican Party.

Our campaign is sincere, with fervent disagreements and intense debates. But let no one be mistaken. You have shown moving evidence that, although Americans may have different opinions, they are all moving forward shoulder to shoulder for the welfare of the nation.

Our current responsibility and opportunity are the greatest in the history of free government. For tonight, our future—our peace, our prosperity, and the fate of freedom itself—hangs in the balance.

Merely winning the election is not our job or our purpose. Our job is to imbue our victory with meaning so that freedom-loving people everywhere will gain courage, move forward, and emerge from this dark despair into the light of freedom.

Our platform declares the signposts that will guide our steadfast efforts in a world of terror. This glorious statement of principles is concise and essential.

You have unanimously adopted it, and I support it unanimously, feeling deeply honored. This is the central message I will bring to the country, and after January 20th, it will be the cornerstone of our Republican government.

We are a united party, and our nation desperately needs the same unity.

Our people are turning away from the baser things that divide us. They yearn to rise to a nobler position and seek a common purpose in the better things that unite us. We must be the instrument to realize this ideal. We must fully unleash the strength of America and refill the turbulent future with opportunity. This is our promise. This will be the fruit of our victory.

If this unity is to be obtained and maintained, it requires great breadth. Its boundaries must transcend politics. Only if free people everywhere can make this unity their common goal can freedom be saved—and it is the only way to save it.

Such unity must be the main pillar of peace. Peace obtained at the cost of freedom is too high a price, and such peace cannot last. Above all else, we must strive, through all peaceful means, to establish a world order based on justice. Such a world will achieve peace. Such peace is worth obtaining. This is the greatest responsibility that our nation places upon us. It is the greatest task to which we are prepared to dedicate ourselves.

The unity we seek transcends the material; it transcends things and methods. It is largely spiritual. Our problem is not outside ourselves; our problem is within ourselves.

In the material realm, we have found ways to make the world explode. In the spiritual realm, we must still seek ways to join together the shattered fragments of the world, to heal the wounds of civilization, and to create a good society composed of people of goodwill, so that our dreams may finally be realized. We have designed noble plans for the new world, but without a new spirit, our noblest plans will be meaningless. We pray that in the days to come, we will be fully endowed with this spirit.

The next presidential term will see the end of the first half of the twentieth century. Thus far, this century has been one of astonishing progress and terrible tragedy. We have seen the world change, and we have seen humanity achieve extraordinary success in its long struggle against nature. However, because we have encountered a disastrous defeat in humanity's quest for peace, security, and understanding, our victories have been overshadowed by darkness. In this age of twentieth-century progress, we have encountered two terrible wars, and between these two wars, there has been the most severe economic depression in human history.

We must learn to do better. The era that is nearly passing away is an era of scientific achievement. The era that lies ahead of us must be an era of human spiritual achievement.

We propose to continue all the great achievements of our era in craftsmanship. We should utilize the various incredible possibilities of atomic energy so that men and women can have a greater and more fulfilling life. We must concentrate all of humanity's energy, intelligence, and determination, focusing wholeheartedly on our task. We must solve the problem of establishing lasting world peace and secure the happiness of freedom and opportunity for our own people and other like-minded peoples.

In my view, to be a Republican in this era, one must be dedicated to human freedom. In this world, half free and half slave, we must work peacefully to help people everywhere gain freedom.

We have determined that our goal is a strong and free America, a free world of free people—freedom of speech, freedom to express new ideas, freedom of publication, freedom of movement, freedom of education, freedom to use the fruits of labor, freedom to worship God, each according to his own conception of God's grace and mercy.

When these rights are secured in the world, the eternal ideals of the Republican Party will be realized.

The ideals of the American people are the ideals of the Republican Party. Here in Philadelphia, the cradle of our own independence, we have ignited a beacon. We light this beacon, giving humanity eternal hope, enabling humanity to live in freedom, with human dignity, and to stand freely before God in a posture of reverence."

### Census of Warehouses: Three Suspected of Hoarding

[Report from this newspaper] The police bureau started a general inspection of warehouses yesterday, and from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM, it is said that three companies suspected of hoarding materials were found. Details are expected to be released tomorrow.

### Strict Control of Materials to Prevent Hoarding: Authorities Decide on Emergency Measures; Order Essential Goods and Warehouse Industries to Report Transaction and Stockpiling Situations; Rice Purchased with Permits from Today at a Price Not Exceeding 100,000 per Liter

[Report from this newspaper] With prices soaring to unprecedented levels recently, Mayor Wu convened an ad hoc emergency meeting of all relevant parties at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss emergency measures. After the meeting adjourned, Mayor Wu reported to the City Council at 3:45 PM, stating: "I feel ashamed as it is my responsibility that prices have soared recently. The price fluctuations yesterday were alarming. Last night, I discussed with the Civil Affairs Commission and the Social Affairs Bureau the method of increasing the allocation of rice. It was decided that starting today, in addition to the existing rice allocation certificates, citizens can also obtain joint purchase certificates, each certificate allowing the purchase of one 'shi sheng' of rice at a price not exceeding 100,000 yuan per 'sheng,' and can purchase rice from rice shops until the end of June. Also, today (the 26th), after inviting the leaders of all relevant parties, Speaker Pan, Xuan Qinwu, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Yu Hongjun, Liu Gongyun, etc., to discuss the matter, four emergency measures were decided: (1) Orders are issued to various industry associations for daily necessities (including grain, miscellaneous grains, cotton, yarn, cloth, cooking oil, fuel, paper, sugar, etc.) to truthfully report all transaction details from the 5th of this month to the date of the report within three days. The purpose is: (a) to determine whether both buyers and sellers are in the trade; (b) to investigate any suspected hoarding. (2) Orders are issued to various warehouse industry associations to report the stockpiling situation of each household and the start date of stockpiling. The purpose is: (a) to determine whether non-industry people are stockpiling goods; (b) to determine whether the stockpiling date exceeds the time limit stipulated by the authorities. (3) The Gold Control Bureau, together with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Audit Department of the Central Bank, are requested to closely monitor the flow of bills in the bill exchange, and investigate whether bills are being used for illegal transactions. (4) The cotton yarn market is fluctuating because factories are worried about insufficient cotton reserves. However, it has been found that there are currently 150,000 bales of cotton stored in Shanghai. In addition to the 57,000 bales stored by the Textile Export Association, 90,000 bales of foreign cotton from U.S. aid have also been allocated. Once the procedures are completed, they can be distributed, so there is no shortage of cotton reserves. The meeting also decided that those found to have committed speculation, manipulation, or hoarding in the recent surge in prices will be reported to the central government for strict punishment. It is now proposed that the senators provide sound solutions.

[Another report] Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. In the morning, he met with Lin Chongyong, director of the Hankou Gold Control Bureau, Gao Fang, director of the Guangzhou Gold Control Bureau, etc., and inquired about the financial situation in various places. In the afternoon, he went to the municipal government to attend the emergency economic meeting. It is said that the central government is extremely concerned about the high prices in Shanghai. His decision to come to Shanghai is to discuss concrete solutions with the relevant leaders of the city. As for the methods of selling off materials and tightening credit, they will be strengthened in the future, and sales will be expanded starting next week.

### The Sixth Session of the City Council: A Debate on Property Tax Unfolds; Fierce Debate for Three Hours; No Conclusion

[Report from this newspaper] The sixth session of the City Council held its fourth meeting yesterday. During the meeting, a heated debate was launched on the case of the Legislative Yuan discussing the collection of property tax. It lasted for more than three hours, with 20 senators speaking. Opinions on the case were mixed. At the statutory adjournment time, no conclusion could be reached. Moreover, the senators present continued to leave, and there were not enough to meet the legal quorum, so a vote could not be held. It was decided to postpone the discussion and resolution to the fifth meeting.

At the beginning of yesterday's meeting, Speaker Pan introduced Mayor Wu's report on emergency measures to deal with price fluctuations, and then began discussing the opinions of the various group review proposals. The agenda was scheduled to discuss a total of three proposals from the Civil Affairs Group, a total of thirteen proposals from the Finance Group, and a total of twenty proposals from the Public Works Group.

Civil Affairs Section

Two cases were passed: (1) It is proposed to request the municipal government to effectively protect local autonomous personnel, not to arbitrarily detain them, and to strengthen the connection between the autonomous units of each district and the affiliated units of the municipal government, so as to achieve operational efficiency. (2) A request is made to telegraph the central government again to re-determine the erroneous division of Zhu Zhai semi-town into provincial jurisdiction, so as to comply with the constitutional government's respect for public opinion and promote the new administration. Another case, that the Baojia chiefs are also civil servants and should have the right to in-kind rations, was resolved and sent to the Civil Affairs Bureau for research.

Financial Section

Two cases were passed and two cases were reserved. When it came to the fifth case of property tax, a lengthy debate was triggered. The two cases passed were (1) the council should promptly send a letter to the municipal government to forward to the Gold Control Bureau, and immediately abolish the method of not allowing customers' bills to be used for offsetting on the same day. (2) An urgent telegram should be sent to the central government to promptly transfer the funds and deposits that the Chinese people have evaded abroad for the time being as reserves, and immediately reform the currency system to consolidate finance and stabilize people's hearts.

Two Views on the Property Tax Case

Regarding the proposal to levy property tax, the original proposals had the same nature: (1) He Chengfu proposed two opposing proposals by Chen Zhang, and Gong Da and other 20 people jointly signed, advocating telegraphing the local legislators to strictly support the levy of temporary property tax, so as to equalize social wealth and save the crisis. (2) Wang Ziyang and other 54 people jointly proposed: a telegram should be sent to the Legislative Yuan to suspend the levy of property tax, and immediately formulate a law to investigate the capital of the wealthy, so as to stabilize people's hearts and balance wealth. After convening a review meeting, it was merged into the second case and submitted together, proposing that the general assembly telegraph the Legislative Yuan: (1) suspend the levy of property tax; (2) promptly formulate another law to investigate the capital of the wealthy, ordering the registration of property and adding tax.

When the case was brought up for discussion, He Chengfu, the proposer who supported property tax, first requested Wang Yansong, the convener of the review meeting, to explain the reasons for the merger, and then the debate began. Those who participated in the debate included He Chengfu, Yan Esheng, Fan Xipin, Zhang Zhihan, Jiang Hao, Fei Shusheng, Chen Gongda, Xu _, Qu Yue, Fan Shouyuan, Xu Yongzuo, Zhang Zhongyuan, Chu Shun, Zhao Yangxiong, Jiang Haoran, Bu Yongsheng, Yang Fusheng, etc. The main points of the opinions of both sides are summarized as follows:

Advocating Suspension

Those who believe in levying property tax think (1) The minimum amount for property tax is 30 billion yuan. At the current rate of inflation, in a few months, everyone's property will become the object of collection. (2) The real wealthy have already fled their assets abroad. Even those in the country, those who hide are gold and foreign currencies, which are easy to hide. As a result, only the goods, equipment, machinery, factories, ships, vehicles, etc. of industry and commerce that cannot be concealed have to be truthfully declared and pay taxes according to regulations, and they will inevitably have to sell the goods and raw materials on which they rely for daily use and transportation, leading to bankruptcy. (3) The levy of property tax will inevitably cause a large escape of capital. The large ones will fly away, and the small ones will speculate in gold and banknotes. (4) Although the draft property tax regulations stipulate that all real estate and movable property of Chinese people abroad and non-Chinese people in China will be taxed, it is difficult to implement. (5) The government has not proposed the levy of property tax, only some legislators have proposed it. (6) Taxes that harass the majority of people are bad taxes, and there is no need for them to be established. (7) The government already has seven or eight types of tax laws, and it should first study how to strengthen collection, which will be more helpful to balance revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the levy of property tax is not an urgent matter at present.

Supporting the Levy

Those who believe in property tax think (1) Eight years of war of resistance, followed by civil strife, the people's lives have long been unbalanced. Only by making everyone have clothes to wear and food to eat, and money to contribute money, and strength to contribute strength, can the tide of the situation be reversed. (2) The case was proposed by the first democratically elected legislators, and it does not seem appropriate for the local council to arbitrarily request a suspension. (3) The temporary property tax is for the purpose of cooperating with the suppression of the rebellion policy. If a suspension is requested, it is tantamount to believing that the suppression of the rebellion policy is no longer necessary. (4) The industrial and commercial circles do not need to worry, because the property tax is generally levied, and the wealthy are no exception. Moreover, before the levy, it must go through procedures such as investigation and declaration, and will never deliberately destroy industry and commerce.

Compromise suggestions

(1) It is hoped that Senator Wang Gu will return to the various districts he represents, and generally solicit the opinions of all voters on the levy of property tax, and then report to the meeting to see what the public opinion is. (2) All the opinions supporting and opposing the property tax today will be recorded in the file. At the same time, the council will conduct a general public opinion survey, summarize and provide it to the Legislative Yuan for reference. (3) The Legislative Yuan has not yet made a principled passage on this case, and is still under review by the group. It may be better not to express an opinion for the time being to see the development. (4) It may be better to modify the wording of the original proposal to levy property tax under the condition of not hindering the survival of legitimate industry and commerce.

### Teachers of Private Schools Push Representatives to Petition the Council Education Bureau

[Report from this newspaper] Teachers of private primary schools in the city, in order to request rice allocation loans and subsidies, sent 30 to 40 representatives to the City Council yesterday to petition, and also went to the Education Bureau to meet Director Li to state their reasons. Director Li promised to reply on Monday afternoon.

### Rice Certificates for July Will Be Distributed Starting Today

According to reliable information from the Civil Affairs Commission: The rice allocation certificates for July have been sent to the Bao Offices and distributed to the Jia chiefs. The Jia chiefs will distribute them to each household on the 27th and 28th. During the certificate issuance period, residents who registered their household in May but failed to receive the July rice allocation certificate should go to the Jia chiefs to receive it on the 29th and 30th of this month. No supplementary issuance will be made after the deadline. In order to strengthen the rice allocation work in July, the association will hold a meeting of district representatives and group leaders of rice shops in the city at the Lawyers Association on Huangpi South Road at 9:00 AM this morning. It is said that rice for teachers and staff of private primary and secondary schools has begun to be distributed today and will be completed before the 30th of this month.

### Business Community Held a Symposium Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Levying Property Tax; Representatives Set to Go to Beijing Tonight to Petition

The Shanghai Industrial Association Preparatory Committee and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to oppose the issue of levying property tax, specially invited legal scholars and people from the press in the city to hold a symposium at the sixth floor of the China Merchants Bureau at noon yesterday. Speaker Pan first expressed his opinions: (1) Oppose the method of reporting secrets to prevent abuses. (2) The starting point of taxation must be considered, paying attention to the current price level. (3) Legal persons should not be included. Mr. Pan also pointed out that although the motive of property tax is good, the result will be contrary to the intention of equalizing wealth. Subsequently, Zhang Shizhao, Cheng Cangbo, Shan Yuhua, Xu Yongzuo and others successively expressed their opinions, and all agreed that the purpose of property tax is indisputable, but it should be clear that the target is the wealthy. Cheng Cangbi also pointed out that the industrial and commercial circles must pay attention to public opinion offensives, and should openly or use radio stations to debate with the legislators who proposed the proposal, so as to win the support of public opinion. The meeting ended at three o'clock. In addition, the representatives of the industrial and commercial circles of the city are scheduled to go to Beijing tonight to attend the meeting of the Finance and Finance Examination Committee convened by the Legislative Yuan tomorrow to state the opinions of the industrial and commercial circles.

[Report from this newspaper] Zhu Shunkun, Deputy Director of the Fuel Management Committee of the Shanghai District of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was arrested at No. 45, Meiguo New Village, Nanjing, on the evening of the 24th, for absconding after embezzling public funds while serving as the former commander.

When the 72nd Division was transferred to the Tianjin-Pukou Line in October last year, Zhu was dismissed for cause. In January of this year, due to his relationship with the Youth Party, he was appointed Deputy Director of the Fuel Management Committee of the Shanghai District of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Director of the Transportation Department. Recently, someone reported to the Wuhan Pacification Office, and the Military Law Office of the Office sent a judge to Shanghai with an official letter, requesting the garrison brigade of the Garrison Command to assist.

Huang expressed his satisfaction that the District Procuratorate handles cases quickly, and can complete an average of one case in ten days. He finally explained that after the amnesty and commutation of sentences, a total of more than 3,000 people were released in the city.

The report that the Ministry instructed the Shanghai District Court that buying and selling silver coins is not illegal is absolutely incorrect.

### Price Indices Far Out of Touch: Relevant Parties to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Index Compilation Issues

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Federation of Labor previously requested the Social Affairs Bureau to publish a decision on the cost of living index every half month. Yesterday, this reporter visited Director Wu to inquire about his opinion. Director Wu stated that during this time of rampant price increases, workers are deeply affected by the hardships in their lives. The request from the Federation of Labor to publish the cost of living index every half month, so that there is a basis for issuing wages every half month, is reasonable. However, there is one difficulty: publishing a decision every half month is beyond the capacity of the Bureau's statistics office, and approximately half the personnel would need to be added. Due to economic limitations, it is proposed that the Federation of Labor assist with index compilation. Regarding whether there are technical difficulties in publishing a decision every half month, a meeting will be held at the Social Affairs Bureau on the 28th, with Municipal Government Statistics Chief Zhang Zongmeng, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Statistics Office of the Federation of Labor to discuss and decide. If the principle is approved, it will be implemented starting next month.

Endure Hardships Together, Overcome Difficulties Together

This reporter also inquired about this issue to Senator Wang Xianqing. According to him, if the multiplier is too small next month, the average worker and staff will be unable to maintain their minimum standard of living. If the increase is too large, factories will face the danger of being unable to survive. Therefore, the agency compiling the index must conduct thorough research and develop a proper plan. However, he believes that at this critical stage, there is no longer a distinction between labor and management. The most important thing is that both parties cooperate, endure hardships together, and overcome difficulties together. Ye Xianggao, Standing Director of the Federation of Labor, stated that the authorities should expedite and effectively manage the rationing of essential goods.

Ways Should Be Found to Suppress and Stabilize Prices

Subsequently, Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Federation of Labor, also told reporters that calculating wages based on the cost of living index is purely a method to ensure that wages and prices do not become disconnected, allowing the average worker to obtain a fair and reasonable standard of living. Since its implementation, it has been very effective, and labor-management disputes have been continuously reduced. However, in the past one or two months, prices have reached a rampant state, even changing several times a day. Under these circumstances, it is no longer possible to calculate wages using the cost of living index. Even if the index multiplier is increased, it would not be beneficial for factories, and it would not necessarily be a blessing for the workers themselves. The fundamental problem is that without appropriate measures to suppress prices, the future is unimaginable. If wages and prices are too far apart, not only will workers' livelihoods be affected, leading to continuous labor-management disputes, but social order and security will also be negatively impacted. He personally believes that the best solution is for the government to take urgent measures to stabilize prices as soon as possible. At the same time, the compilation of the index should also include a renewed household survey and an increase in quality and weight. He said that tomorrow at 9 a.m., relevant parties will meet at the Social Affairs Bureau to thoroughly discuss this issue in order to find an appropriate solution.

### Airline Fare Adjustments Not Yet Approved by Ministry of Communications; Ship Price Increase Postponed to the 29th

The Ministry of Communications has not yet approved the Civil Aviation Company's request to adjust fares. According to the person in charge of the China Central No. 2 Company, the main factors for adjusting civil aviation fares are fuel consumption and the cost of living index for employees. If the government can stabilize fuel prices and the cost of living index, then civil aviation fares can be maintained without increases. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications will slightly reduce the 189% fare adjustment requested by the Civil Aviation Company. Furthermore, the Shipowners' Association previously decided to adjust all passenger and freight rates on all routes by 80% and agreed to implement it on the 28th of this month. As the Ministry of Communications has not yet responded, and the price increase procedures could not be completed due to the short timeframe, it has been decided to postpone the implementation to the 29th.

### Automatic Traffic Lights First Installed for Trial Use on Nanjing West Road

The long-rumored automatic traffic control lights will soon be installed and used in this city. The traffic authorities, considering the heavy traffic and congestion in the city center, especially the many handcarts, tricycles, and rickshaws that do not follow traffic rules, believe that the free movement of these vehicles may cause poor order once automatic traffic lights are implemented. In order to increase public awareness and understanding of traffic control methods, it is proposed to move the originally planned installation of lights to Nanjing West Road for trial use. The first phase is planned to be installed from Dihua North Road to Shaanxi North Road, at five locations: Dihua North Road, Huashan Road, Changde Road, Tongren Road, and Shaanxi North Road. The automatic traffic lights have three signals: red, yellow, and green. The yellow light prohibits vehicles still before the stop line from proceeding. Vehicles past the line can continue.

### French Ship Returns to Marseille Regularly; Smoleny Returns to Soviet Union Today

The Soviet ship Atun, which previously delivered 1,000 tons of newspapers, was scheduled to load ore and other goods and return to Vladivostok after unloading. Due to delays in loading, it could not return to the Soviet Union as scheduled. Furthermore, the Smoleny arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month and is currently docked at the Taikoo Wharf. Approximately 300 tons of outgoing goods, including ore and miscellaneous items, have been loaded, and it is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 2 p.m. today to return to Vladivostok.

### Trafficking Arms to Support Bandits: Large Organization Uncovered; Three Main Culprits Arrested

The Songhu Garrison Headquarters recently received a report that there was a large organization in a certain district of this city that was trafficking arms to support bandits. The headquarters sent personnel to conduct a secret investigation and confirmed the report. They then took action a few days ago, immediately going to the address and arresting the three main culprits, Xue Yongqi and others. They also seized more than 4,000 rounds of various types of bullets. They were immediately taken to headquarters for interrogation. After confirming the facts, they have been sent to the military court for trial. It is reported that this organization had close ties with bandit areas and regularly searched for and purchased arms in various places, smuggling them to bandit areas for profit. Although the Garrison Headquarters has arrested the main culprits, the information provided is quite complex and involves many people. The Garrison Headquarters is currently conducting a thorough investigation, and there should be significant developments in the coming days.

### Residents of Disaster Area on Yanping Road Prohibited from Erecting Buildings

[Report from this newspaper] After the fire on Yanping Road, residents living in the area, such as Zhang Anqing, continued to erect buildings there. Despite repeated requests from creditors such as Xu Juxiang, they refused to move out. Xu and others filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the district court. Yesterday, Judge Zhao opened the trial and ruled that after providing a security deposit of 200 million yuan, the plaintiffs were granted permission to prohibit the debtors from building houses or other similar structures on the plot of land owned by the plaintiffs in the Fahua District, Xinzha Road, Yanping Road (formerly known as Jinjia Lane).

### Truth Comes Out in Case of Male Corpse Strangled on Zhongshan Road; Murderer Arrested

[Report from this newspaper] On June 2nd of last year, a man who had been strangled with a rope was found on the railway side of Wangjiazai Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei. Two seals and a national identity card were found on his person, revealing that the deceased was named Wu Shanzhong, a rickshaw puller who resided at No. 26, Lane 451, Yuyao Road. At the time, the murderer was at large, and the case had not been solved. A few days ago, the Yulin Road Police Station received a tip that the main culprit in the case, Chen Hongxiang, was hiding in a shed on Yulin Road. Chief Zhou of the precinct ordered the troop leader Cheng Wengui and police officers Tian Changyuan and Li Canyin to rush to the scene and arrest Chen. According to Chen's confession, his father, Zhu Zhaoqing, and Wu Shanzhong were friends and both engaged in thievery. One day, Wu told Chen that he had found a job in a certain government agency and would soon start working there. Zhu, upon learning this, was deeply afraid that Wu would harm him once he became successful. Therefore, he gathered Ding Laizi, Hu Zhaowu, Huang Baozhang, and others to discuss a plan to murder Wu. On the evening of June 1st, they invited Wu to dinner at Zhu Zhaoqing's shed in Zhabei, got him drunk with alcohol, and then took a walk along Zhongshan Road. Unexpectedly, Chen used a rope to strangle Wu's neck, and the other accomplices helped to strangle him to death. They abandoned the body by the roadside and dispersed in a panic. However, Zhu Zhaoqing, who had committed numerous crimes, was arrested by the police station this spring and sentenced to three and a half years in prison by the court. The other accomplices, Ding Laizi and others, are at large and are currently being pursued.

### Theft Case at Shengsheng Art Company; Seven Criminals Arrested in New Hotel

[Report from this newspaper] At approximately 2 a.m. on the morning of the 20th of this month, a major theft occurred at the Shengsheng Art Company at No. 102 Huacaoxi Road.

### Shanghai Has 4 Million Moviegoers Every Month; Tragic, Thrilling, and Technicolor Films Are Most Popular

[Special Report from This Newspaper] In the city, watching movies is the most common form of entertainment, and movie theaters have the most customers among various entertainment businesses.

There are originally 47 movie theaters in Shanghai, but one of them, Jiuxing, is now showing Shanghai opera, so there are only 46 left. There are 22 first-run theaters, 5 second-run theaters, 15 third-run theaters, and 4 fourth-run theaters. The Guangming Theater has the most seats, with 1,951, and the Ping An Theater has the fewest, with only 500.

The number of first-run theaters has increased significantly after the war, which is an abnormal phenomenon. Before the war, the standard for first-run theaters was location and facilities. Now, any theater that can obtain the first-run rights to a film is upgraded to first-run. Therefore, except for a few "old" first-run theaters, the facilities of the so-called first-run theaters today are not up to standard.

What is the approximate number of moviegoers in the city? The total number of seats in the 46 movie theaters is over 40,000. With four showings a day, if every show is sold out, there are more than 180,000 moviegoers every day, and more than 5 million every month. In reality, this number should be reduced by 70% to 80%. According to the statistics for May, the total number of moviegoers in all movie theaters in the city was nearly 4 million. The audience statistics for several first-class movie theaters are as follows: Guangming 199,000, Queen 147,900, Majestic 146,000, Golden 120,000, Great Shanghai 116,000, Dahua 111,500, Huguang 100,850, and Cathay 100,320.

Different films have different audiences. Generally speaking, audiences for domestic films prefer tragic and moving plots. Therefore, "Eight Years of Separation" and "Before Dawn" are the best-selling films. Other films that are "bitter" generally appeal to people's tastes. For Western films, Technicolor and thrilling action films are the most popular, such as Errol Flynn's "Objective, Burma!", Esther Williams' "Bathhouse Beauty," and the magnificent and fantastical "Arabian Nights," all of which have been screened repeatedly and have remained popular for a long time.

Movie Theaters and Film Distributors Are Partners

The films shown in movie theaters are all supplied by film distributors. Movie theaters and film distributors can be said to be partners. The former has theaters, and the latter has films. Movie theaters attract film distributors with their facilities and location, while film distributors use their products to attract movie theaters and strive to select films that meet the needs of Shanghai audiences. Therefore, a star who is extremely popular in the United States may not be popular in China, and vice versa, a film that is very successful in China may not be a four-star or five-star film in its home country.

Historically, the films shown in each movie theater throughout the year were pre-determined with film distributors at the end of the previous year. Each contract is for about 20 to 30 films, often mixed with a few special films that are particularly appealing or have a particularly large production cost, which are required to be shown at a "special price," such as "Torpedo Alley," which was shown simultaneously at the Guangming and Cathay theaters in the past.

The Length of Screening Depends Entirely on Box Office

The length of the screening period for each film is determined by the number of viewers. The theater and the film distributor have historically stipulated that the film will only be replaced when the number of viewers drops by 50%. For example, if a movie theater has 1,000 seats and shows the film four times a day, the total number of seats is 4,000. If the number of viewers per day is more than 2,000, then the film must continue to be shown. However, sometimes the screening can be stopped by mutual agreement under the circumstances of reluctance to stop or an accumulation of new films. To avoid this situation, several movie theaters often show the same film simultaneously, which is also a major reason for the proliferation of first-run theaters today.

After the film distributor and the movie theater sign the contract, they deliver the films to the movie theater for screening one after another. The movie theater does not have to pay the film distributor when it receives the films, but the remaining amount after deducting the entertainment tax and stamp tax from the screening income is divided equally between the two parties. For example, if the ticket price is 300,000 yuan, the entertainment tax of 20% is 60,000 yuan, and the stamp tax of 5% is 12,000 yuan. The remaining amount is 114,000 yuan for each film distributor and movie theater. If the ticket price is 60,000 yuan, the entertainment tax is 12,000 yuan, and the stamp tax is 2,400 yuan. The remaining amount is 22,800 yuan for each film distributor and movie theater. The movie theater must also pay business tax, license tax, income tax, profit tax, construction donations, and other taxes.

Because the screening income is divided equally, both parties are very concerned about the income figures. Film distributors often send people to monitor the movie theater's business situation and are particularly active in advocating for adjustments to ticket prices. Whether it is Chinese or Western film distributors, due to the depreciation of the national currency and the huge costs, they all hope that ticket prices can be increased step by step.

Soaring Expenses and Endless Complaints

Movie theaters also have many difficulties: prices are soaring, expenses are increasing, and movie ticket prices cannot keep up with other prices. There are many people who watch movies without paying, and there are often "unfounded disasters." For example, the manager of a movie theater was summoned to the police station and detained for a day because someone was found smoking in the movie theater, and someone else was eating something with shells, so the movie theater manager was held responsible. But in fact, the theater party, in addition to posting "No Smoking" signs, has no authority to enforce the ban at all. It is no wonder that they want to complain about this kind of suffering in place of others.

Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau stipulated that 30% of the seats in first-run movie theaters should be priced-controlled seats, which is certainly a good thing for most citizens, but second-, third-, and fourth-run movie theaters are complaining endlessly because first-run theaters have more than 27,000 of the city's 40,000 seats, and the 30% price-controlled seats are more than 8,000, accounting for 42% of the seats in all second-, third-, and fourth-run movie theaters. Everyone tends to go to first-run movie theaters for the same price, so the business of second-, third-, and fourth-run movie theaters is greatly affected.

### Price Increases Continue Unabated; Food Market Temporarily Closed; Top Quality White Rice Sold at 22 Million Yuan Per Dan

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the price increases in this city did not show any signs of easing. The retail price of top quality white rice has actually reached 22 million yuan per dan, and the retail prices of daily necessities are also rising steadily. The black market price of gold and banknotes is similar to the previous day, and the prices of 11 types of stocks hit their upper limits again at around 10 a.m.

In order to curb the rising prices, the municipal authorities consulted with brokers in the rice, oil, grains, and flour industries yesterday and asked them to withdraw from the market, because the authorities found that brokers' transactions on behalf of people outside the industry were fueling price increases. The brokers in the four industries accepted this request, so the markets for all four industries were closed yesterday. Whether trading will resume tomorrow will be decided by the Municipal Government's Economic Council. At the same time, a public notice was issued to citizens stating that those with food purchase permits issued by the Civil Survey Association in June can purchase one liter of rice per permit at rice shops in their respective districts, and the price should not exceed 100,000 yuan. The rice shops will also indicate the purchaser's baojia, name, and address on the purchase permit for verification purposes.

The reasons for the recent rise in prices are varied, but the main causes are the reversal of the war situation and the influx of speculative capital from the south. Therefore, how to curb the rising prices should also be approached from the root cause. Because the public's sentiments have been extremely volatile in the past two days, piecemeal measures to address the symptoms will be difficult to achieve the desired results.

### No Transactions Outside the Market Either

Another report: Yesterday, many economic police officers were monitoring transactions at the north and south rice markets, so goods owners did not dare to display samples and quote prices. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau secretly notified the market to suspend trading, so there were no transactions yesterday. Before 10:30 a.m., traders had left one after another. The Civil Survey Association continued to supply rice as usual, with no changes in quantity or price. The markets for grains, cooking oil, and flour were all notified by the Social Affairs Bureau to suspend trading for one day, so people had dispersed before 11 a.m., and no transactions took place. Even outside the market, there were no transactions because no one was willing to sell. Buyers holding cash could not buy goods, and top quality white rice was nowhere to be found. Medium quality rice was 20 million yuan per shi, and low quality rice was 18 million yuan, and each person could only buy one or two liters. Flour sold for 5.8 million yuan (soldier ship flour), soybean oil for 520,000 yuan per jin, and vegetable oil for 600,000 yuan, and it was still difficult to buy more.

### High Opening Prices in the Market, Chinese Stocks Continue to Soar

Chinese stocks continued to soar yesterday, presenting a fiery scene at the market opening, with nineteen stocks hitting their upper limit. Yong Yarn even briefly traded at a price below the limit several times. After police arrived at the market and off-market trading also subsided, things gradually calmed down.

The morning opened with high prices. Yong Yarn opened at 5150 yuan, initially rising to 5500 yuan before falling back to 5430 yuan. At 10:03 AM, Yong Yarn also announced its upper limit. Zhabei Yong Gong, Rong Feng, Lianhua, Huafeng, Hengfeng, Tongyi, Yongye, Sino-French, Xinhe, Zhongxing, etc., all hit their upper limits. The Meiya Match also approached its limit. Yong Yarn's grey market price was rumored to be as high as 5600 yuan. After police arrived and agency fees opened as high as 104 yuan and 110 yuan, off-market trading also subsided, causing the price to fall to 5300 yuan. The noon closing was 5360 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, Xinguang rose slightly, Xinyi and Wuhe rose by half a percent, and underwear rose by 10%. Yong Yarn, Sino-French, Xinhe, Jingfu, Qinxing, Huafeng, Yong Gong, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Jinglun, Guohuo, Shangwu, Xinhua, and Zhabei stocks hit their upper limits before receding slightly. Huaxin, Heng , Meiya Match, Zhongni, Yongye, Lian Di, and Yongye hit their upper limits. Unlisted stocks outside the market generally rose again, with cultural and banking stocks performing particularly well.

The capital increase of Lian'an Department Store has been approved and is scheduled to be listed for trading on the 28th, with a transaction unit of one million shares.

Government bonds rose slowly again yesterday. Unified C opened in the morning at 670,000, with a high price of 730,000. The noon closing retreated to 680,000, with approximately four million in transactions. Compared to the previous closing, A, B, and C bonds rose by 60,000 yuan, while D and E bonds rose by 70,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks: Yesterday's meeting location was interfered with by the police authorities, making it difficult to conduct business normally. Yisha retreated from a new high of 14.5 million to close at 13 million. Compared to the previous closing, Yisha, British United Paper, Yi , Shipping, and Steel stocks each rose by about 10%, while Jardine Matheson rose by half a percent, and the stock exchange did not rise much.

Another report: Short-term treasury bills will be traded as usual on the morning of June 30th, but there has been no clear public announcement regarding the market outlook for the 29th and 30th.

### Market Conditions in Various Locations

### Police Inspection at the Market, Cloth Trading Dormant, Fine Yarn Price Slightly Higher Than Yesterday

Due to the continuous surge in cotton yarn prices, the authorities have taken notice. Members of the Economic Supervisory Group were dispatched to patrol the market, leading to a reduction in gatherings, scattered public sentiment, and dormant trading. It is also heard that the authorities will thoroughly inspect warehouses, and cotton yarn warehouse receipts must also be registered. Therefore, there were quoted prices in the market but a lack of buyers. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was priced at 900 million yuan, a slight increase of 30 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, ranging from 10 million to 30-40 million.

Due to the presence of police closely monitoring trading activities within the market, the cotton cloth market has been brought to a standstill. There are very few transactions, with the price of Dragon Head cloth outside the market quoted at 24.55 million yuan.

Additionally, the Textile Construction Company is selling Dragon Head fine cloth, Four Gentlemen serge, Jumping Carp bleached cloth, Yuanfu silk, Caishen white Fufu silk, Tianjin Red Wufu bleached hemp glue cloth, etc., as usual, totaling 31 types. The quantity and price are determined by the buyer and decided by the China Textile Corporation.

Woolens Firmly Rise

The market prices of woolens,毛織品 silk yarns, linings, and other piece goods rose again yesterday. Overcoat woolens were particularly popular, because the price of American-made Melton was estimated to be 10 million, while the China Textile Corporation's price for overcoat woolens and thin woolens was raised by an additional 10%, further reinforcing public sentiment and encouraging hoarding.

### Issuing Exchange Settlement Certificates, National Bank Clarifies Points of Attention

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Business Bureau of the Central Bank issued Circular No. 144 to all designated banks, stipulating the points of attention for issuing ordinary and special exchange settlement certificates. The contents are as follows:

(1) Designated banks may issue ordinary exchange settlement certificates when purchasing foreign exchange such as telegraphic transfers, drafts, and documentary bills, but not when purchasing from their domestic or foreign branches.

(2) Designated banks may not issue exchange settlement certificates for foreign exchange purchased from their branches or other designated banks, because the bank that originally purchased the foreign exchange has already issued an exchange settlement certificate.

(3) When foreign exchange purchased by foreign branches and agencies of designated banks (with a note indicating that it must be paid with national currency remittances) is directly entrusted to the designated bank for sale, it should be resold to the Central Bank immediately, and the Central Bank will issue a special exchange settlement certificate.

(4) The Central Bank may issue special exchange settlement certificates when purchasing the above-mentioned foreign exchange in item (3), but only if it meets one of the following conditions: A. The purchaser is the designated bank's spot foreign exchange, B. The designated bank's foreign exchange daily report has been accurately reported.

(5) Designated banks shall not issue exchange settlement certificates before actually purchasing foreign exchange, nor shall they delay issuing them after purchase for the sake of their own benefit. (However, if the designated bank has a debt relationship with the seller and withholds the exchange settlement certificate, the Central Bank has no intention of interfering.

(6) If there is any conflict between the Central Bank's previous circulars and this circular, the latter shall prevail.

The second Shanghai Tennis League, Group A, began this afternoon. Jinlan is on bye, and the remaining six teams are listed as follows:

Enpai vs. Lianmei at Enpai

Youlian vs. Tiyun at Youlian

Zhonghua vs. Deng at Zhonghua

Lianmei has gathered good players from the sea, with strong strength. Ye Guanxiong, Lin Baohua, and Li Wencheng, a good player from Indonesia, are all playing for the team. Mr. Li is an Indonesian national team player, but was unable to play due to illness. He will stay in Shanghai after the meeting and is currently serving in Northwest Airlines with Lin Baohua. He is expected to be one of the players with championship hopes in this season's Shanghai Open. Enpai won fifth place last year. Lianmei is now a different team, and Enpai seems unlikely to win.

Zhonghua vs. Lvdeng is one of the most average groups of today's three groups. Both sides have foreign players to help. Liang Baokui, the old partner of Cai Guohong in the first group of Zhonghua, has not yet returned to Shanghai, which is inevitably slightly affected. Xu Shaomei and Shi Guiya of Lvdeng may have hopes of winning. The remaining four pairs are also evenly matched, and the scores must be very close.

### Last Night's Basketball Game: World Games Team Wins Narrowly Against Police Star Team, Unexpected Tension, 63-53

[Our Newspaper] The World Games basketball team defeated the Police Star team last night with a score of 63-53, completing their fifth victory in Shanghai. The score was 24-23 in the first half, with the World Games team leading by one point. Although the Police Star team tried their best to resist, they were ultimately defeated due to slightly inferior skills. Except for the last few minutes, the score difference remained between two and three goals. The Police Star team gave their best effort, but the World Games team's performance was not particularly outstanding.

At 7:30 PM, Yu Ju-lu mistakenly reported the time, and Wang Jisi and Liu Hesheng officiated. The World Games team used Da Li and A Bao as guards, Wenhua as center, and Yu Jin, Shi Qiao, and Fu Bi on the left and right. The Police Star team countered with Wu Xinyun, Xu Zhongyi, Chuan Qixia, Wang Rongsheng, and Yao Wenyi. A Bao made two free throws, and Wenhua shot from a distance, giving the World Games team a 4-0 lead. The Police Star team quickly caught up, with the score at 8-7, a difference of one point. Xiao Wu continued to work hard, breaking through with a single shot, and the Police Star team took the lead for the first time at 13-12. A Di replaced Yu Jin, and the two sides engaged in a back-and-forth battle. At 21-20, the Police Star team took the lead for the second time. The score fluctuated rapidly, and the tension was unexpected. The score at halftime was 24-23, with the World Games team leading by half a point.

After switching sides, the World Games team replaced Li Zhenzhong with Huang Tianxi and launched an attack while the Police Star team's formation was unstable. Wenhua and Shi Qiao attacked from both sides. When the score was 42-35, Qi Xia was fouled out five times and replaced by Le Jiazhou. Both sides scored with long shots. In the last few minutes, the World Games team led by ten points. When Xiao Wu shot from a distance and Shi Qiao scored, the World Games team won with a score of 63-53 as the buzzer sounded.

### World Heavyweight Championship Fight: Joe Louis Remains Champion, Knocking Out Walcott in the Eleventh Round

[United Press, New York, 25th] Heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis and challenger Walcott held a championship match tonight at Yankee Stadium, with 50,000 spectators. The fight was scheduled for 15 rounds. Louis knocked out his opponent in the eleventh round, retaining the crown. After defeating Walcott tonight, boxing champion Joe Louis announced his retirement, saying, "For my mother's sake, tonight was my last fight."

[United Press, New York, 25th] World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis knocked out his challenger Walcott in the eleventh round at Yankee Stadium on the evening of the 25th, retaining his crown. Louis immediately announced his retirement after the victory.

Two minutes and fifty-two seconds into the eleventh round, Louis knocked out his black opponent. Since winning the world championship after defeating Braddock, the boxing king has defended his title 25 times, with no defeats. The first ten rounds of this battle were uneventful and dull. Only in the third round, Louis was knocked down by a fierce blow, counted to three, and then jumped up and resumed fighting, which was more spectacular. By the eleventh round, many believed that Walcott had performed well and had more points than Louis, and should win. Unexpectedly, the boxing king landed a heavy right punch, and Walcott fell and failed. The process of today's battle was dull, similar to the battle between Louis and Pellekaan two years ago, and the speed of the two battles was also unexpected.

Before knocking out his opponent, Walcott hit Louis in the head with a heavy right punch, and the boxing king seemed to be unsteady. Then the two exchanged blows at close range. Louis's left hook injured Walcott, and the latter fell on the ropes. Then the two 34-year-old black boxers exchanged blows. The Brown Bomber hooked with his left hand, and "Jesse" Walcott staggered and nearly fell. Louis hit again with his right hand, and Walcott stumbled and fell on the canvas, his back to the sky. After lying down for three seconds, Walcott supported himself with his hands and knees, trying to stand up, crawling along the stage, trying to straighten his feet. The referee counted to ten, and although Walcott had one knee off the ground, he still could not stand up and failed.

Louis and Walcott first met on December 5 last year at Madison Square Garden in New York, where Walcott made a splash and knocked Joe Louis down twice in a row. Although Louis won due to superior points, the opinions of the three judges and referees were not consistent.

In the third round, Old Hua swung his right fist into Louis's jaw, and the bomber actually fell to the ground, but immediately jumped up, seemingly unharmed, and immediately began to press his opponent.

Before the knockout, the two were evenly matched and tied. The United Press score sheet indicated that the two had each won four rounds and tied two rounds. Ticket revenue was approximately $700,000, with Louis receiving 40%, approximately $370,000, and Walcott receiving 20%, approximately half of Louis's earnings.

### Scenic Spots of Mount Hua

— Photographed by Gu Dawei

Mount Hua in West Yue, is one of the most beautiful scenic spots in the Qinling Mountains. The five peaks stand tall, verdant and lush, with steep cliffs and majestic grandeur. The main peak overlooks the mountains, and to the north, the Yellow River is faintly visible, like a belt. The Wei River Plain outside Tongguan Pass is clearly visible. To the south, the Qinling Mountains are layered upon layers, hidden in the clouds, making them particularly magnificent.

### Reader Opinions: City Ferry - Dongdong Line, Pudong Residents Appeal for Improvement

To the Editor: In recent years, the city's public utilities have achieved remarkable results under the management of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, which is convenient for citizens. It is a pity that the city ferry is the only item that has not been improved. For example, the Dongdong Line (Dongmen Road - Dongchang Road), which is the most crowded with passengers, only has a single ferry operating after 7:00 PM every day, which is the time when factories are off work and offices are closed, and junior staff are returning home. Passengers are extremely crowded, and those who miss the ferry have to wait for half an hour. These exhausted staff and workers urgently need to return home to rest, standing on the pier, how can they not be anxious. Moreover, because the ferries are small and there are many passengers, they are extremely crowded, and petty thieves take the opportunity to run rampant. Even more serious is that the load is excessive, and safety is a major concern. As for the dim lights on the boat and the chaotic order, they are even more minor matters. I would like to take a corner of your newspaper to appeal to the company authorities to improve the situation and seek benefits for the citizens. I respectfully submit my humble opinions as follows: (1) The ferry service should be extended to 12:00 PM. (2) Two ferries should be used for crossing regularly to avoid overloading. (3) The lighting equipment on the boat should be improved to prevent petty thieves from running rampant. (4) An opinion box should be set up at the pier so that citizens can contribute their opinions at any time. (5) The frequency should be changed to once every ten minutes to allow more passengers to be transported and avoid crowding. (6) Improve pier management and pay attention to the safety of passengers.

### Thoughts on Buying Books

— Bai Yong

No matter how expensive other things are, they all seem secondary to me, because the standard of living can be lowered as much as possible—besides, basic desires are not high. Only when book prices rise do I feel particularly pressured. A person with a special hobby can value the thing they love more than food and clothing. Is that not the meaning of pawning clothes for wine? Naturally, some people will scold, "You can only say such things after you've filled your belly." However, for a taste of life, if only one point can be satisfied, I'm afraid no one is willing to sacrifice it. It's always uncomfortable to be just a machine that digests food. The ancients said that gambling is better than doing nothing, which is also said with deep emotion.

Reading pictures represents my smoking, and night reading can even be seen as drinking old wine. Some people like to smoke cigars or drink baijiu, just like those who love to read Jia Yi's "Guo Qin Lun" and Xin Qiji's poems, they must cry bitterly. But I can't read lingering, sentimental things either. I'm simply terrified of empty talk and incomprehensible joys, sorrows, and loves. I don't have as much ability to imagine as others, and I can't fathom the taste of the Guanxi man and the seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl playing the clapper. An honest person only seeks to understand a little truth. However, history is a specialized tool for lying and deceiving people. So, I look at it little by little from trivial things. If I can string together many pearls, it may be worth more than a city. It's a pity that there are very few people in our team who can create a general principle to give people an overall impression. I might as well sigh in imitation of someone else's tone: "How difficult it is to read books!"

It is certainly a good feeling to throw away a book when tired at noon, but having a job makes it difficult to lie leisurely in the north window. Therefore, before I can throw away the book, I have already hurried into a dream. There is also the fact that a house is worth a gold bar. To have a bright window and a clean desk to enjoy the beauty alone is also a fantasy. Everyone has different interests. You want to read a book, but he insists on listening to the radio. Otherwise, when guests come, you have no choice but to flee, which is more deadly than urging harmony and ruining the fun. Only after 10 o'clock, when everyone is in bed, does the world completely become self-managed. It's better not to turn off the lights and sacrifice a little of other people's sleeping time. You can get about two hours of enjoyable reading, which is so mellow and full of flavor, just like being drunk on old wine. Even on the road to Handan, the stories and characters in the book continue to play out.

Some time ago, the Commercial Press had a big sale. We, who usually gasp when we see the price of books, felt as if we had been granted amnesty. However, just like buying rationed goods, we still couldn't get the first share. Before 9 o'clock in the morning, several people were lined up outside the gate, waiting to "show off their skills." Fortunately, I don't buy much in the way of novels, so I wasn't affected as much. However, I have already found many cheap books with plum blossom stamps in many used bookstores near Henan Road. The original price tag was torn off or wiped off, and the amazing price was written on it! For example, Feng Chengjun's translation of "Dorson's History of the Mongols" was said to be abundant in the first few days, but later there was not a single copy to be found. They were all taken away. Can this also be called flowing into the black market? On the first day, I bought nearly twenty kinds of annual biographies, because biographical literature is my favorite, but the price was over a million! Many famous works in the field of history are not asked about. For example, I have not seen anyone buy all of Feng's translated "Collected Studies on the History and Geography of Central Asia and Southeast Asia." This proves that under today's living conditions, too specialized knowledge has prevented people from daring to take action, and unpopular fields will always remain unpopular.

37 million to buy the entire "Sibu Congkan" reduced-size edition, which is less than three dan of rice. According to pre-war prices, it was only 30 yuan, which is really extremely cheap. But if you take a look around, you can see that there are very few people asking about it. Is it because of low purchasing power? Or are the rich people of poor quality? In the past, when a rich merchant made a fortune, he would buy a copy of the "Twenty-Four Histories" to decorate his living room. Nowadays, nouveau riche probably no longer have this idea, because although book prices have risen, they can't keep up with gold notes. No matter what they buy, they must first calculate the rate of price increase! Also, big nouveau riche look down on these "poor people's beauty" things. They would rather spend gold bars to buy "Essence of Ancient Chinese Bronze," "A Korean Archaeological Atlas," or jade-inlaid rotten hemp paper, large-character, white-paper classics printed by the official publishing houses, which can be used to act like an expert and can be sold for a higher price. Incorporating elegance into business is also a new trend today.

The price of newsprint is breaking the 10 million mark, so printing books is inherently losing money. Paper with printed words is not as expensive as blank paper, which can be transported back and forth in the warehouse as a bargaining chip. Therefore, large bookstores are not willing to publish things. They just take out some old books to respond to the situation. This is too much of a threat to those of us who must have spiritual food. In the past few days, the publications of the Academia Sinica have been reduced in price. I have exhausted all my resources to replenish the "Collected Papers of the Institute of History and Philology," but I ran three times for the twentieth volume, "In Memory of Mr. Cai Yuanpei's Death," but it still hasn't been published. The transportation costs alone have cost me over 100,000. Although I can't help but feel resentment towards the bureaucratic bookstore, it is a great fortune that they are willing to print such purely academic works, so I dare not demand anything else.

### Franklin and Beds

— Painting Studio

Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States, was not only a great politician and diplomat, but also a writer and scientist. He can truly be called a man of all talents. But he had a special view on the matter of sleeping. He advocated that everyone should have two beds. He said that we often wake up in the middle of the night and cannot sleep until dawn because the bedding is too hot. Therefore, he prepared two beds every night, each with bedding. When one bed was "too hot" to sleep in, he quickly jumped to the other bed while still sleepy. It is said that this way of sleeping is the most comfortable and beneficial to health.

### In Memory of Chen Sanli

— Ye Gongchuo

His spirit made mountains and rivers dim, unable to stretch,
Heaven ordained him to be a poet.
His body sustained the situation of an era,
Tears exhausted in the Central Plains from war and devastation.
Life and death, who knows the changing fortunes?
Coming and going originally eliminate grudges and affections.
Heartbroken, a traveler south of Yingcheng,
Even in the earth, he should still mourn for me.

I cannot bear to recall the covenant of forty years,
The high pavilion, singing and appreciating the remaining pieces.
Distinguishing between right and wrong with all our hearts, condemning what all men point to,
Competing for a move first, happily arguing about skills.
Broken dreams can hardly form another world,
Alone, I plan to knock on the heavy spring.
What can be accomplished by bending and stretching like a dragon in the deep?
I gaze at Yan and Yun, a hundred thoughts surge.

### Allegory

— Mao Yi

Since the formation of private property, the evil thought of selfishness has taken root in the hearts of human beings, and it can be said that it has become deeply ingrained to this day. However, as the history of the world has evolved to this day, it is more necessary than ever for everyone to awaken. Otherwise, humanity may only have the dead end of mutual destruction.

Here is a lesser-known Persian allegory, and its revelation should have a sobering effect:

In the year 600 AD, there was a learned and knowledgeable sage. One day, he was taken to heaven in a dream. In heaven, he saw two doors. One door was written with: "The Hall Not Difficult by the True God"; the other door was written with: "The Hall Admired by the True God."

Entering the first door, the sage found many people seated at a great feast. However, the atmosphere here was not pleasant and joyful, but rather bleak and depressed, because everyone's left arm was tied to their side, and everyone's right arm was tied with a long-handled spoon with a belt, and the belt was tied so that their elbows could not bend freely. Therefore, although their spoons could scoop up the delicacies and delicacies set before them, they could not put them into their mouths. Everyone could only sigh and remain there with frowning brows.

Entering the second hall, the atmosphere was full of joy. Everyone was feasting. Although the people here had their arms tied in the same way as the people in the other hall, unable to put food into their mouths, the True God had given them wisdom. Therefore, everyone scooped up the delicacies in front of them and generously fed them to the people next to them. As a result of the alternate feeding, everyone's appetites were satisfied.

From this dream, the sage offered a lesson: On earth, the hungry are those who only think of themselves; as for those who feast, they are those who help each other.

"Those who can give can exist" - selfishness will destroy humanity.

### Strange Tales of Taxes

— Huanren

This time, I came from Shanghai to live in the hometown of Xishi. I happened to hear from my neighbors that the amount of taxes and the variety of items borne by the people here were astounding. I couldn't help but recall the various strange and bizarre taxes recorded in the history of China and foreign countries, ancient and modern. For a moment, I was so excited that I recorded one or two from the history of foreigners with high noses and blue eyes, for the reference of the lords who are in charge of tax collection:

(1) Beard Tax - This is the "achievement" of Peter the Great of Russia, which was not abolished until Empress Catherine came to power. It specifically stipulates that those who do not pay the tax must cut off their beards.

(2) Funeral Tax - Practiced in Romania, the maximum amount is 3,000 yuan.

(3) Piano Tax - Practiced in Italy, 50 lira is charged for each piano.

(4) Billiards Tax - Also practiced in Italy, the maximum amount is 250 lira.

(5) Title Tax - This is a "good tax" in Spain, levied specifically on people with titles. A duke must pay several thousand yuan each year - I sincerely hope that the tax collection lords will pay special attention and follow suit.

(6) Window Tax - Collected in England from 1697 to 1851. The tax collection lords only need to count the number of windows outside each house, which is indeed a "piece of cake" tax collection.

(7) Hearth Tax - A tax of two shillings was levied for each stove, which was also practiced in England from 1662 to 1689.

(8) Pants Tax - This was a harsh tax in 17th century England, which was actually a servants' tax.

(9) Bible Tax - Someone once said in the London Times a long time ago that the Bible would be taxed, but this has not yet been implemented. This may be sarcasm or a prediction. I dare not make a decision on my own and can only wait for the facts to unfold.

### The Taste of Essays

— Li Chu

Food nourishes the body, essays nourish the spirit. Comparing essays to eating is not entirely inappropriate. Here are the flavors I have discerned from tasting recent essays:

(1) Lu Xun: Lu Xun enjoys the reputation of being China's Gorky. He has long held the reins of the literary world. His writing excels at refutation, with a mix of pungency, bitterness, and astringency, especially in his miscellaneous essays. His essays are like a cup of effective but bitter traditional Chinese medicine.

(2) Lin Yutang: The humorous master's writings are abundant and heavily influenced by Western style. His essays are like Western cuisine, not bad in terms of nutrition and presentation, but somewhat lacking in flavor.

(3) Xu Zhimo: Xu Zhimo is overflowing with talent, a born poet. His writings also have a strong Western influence, but with a uniquely rich and sweet taste. His prose and new poetry are undoubtedly like chocolate candy.

(4) Yu Dafu: Dafu's writing is like the man himself: unconstrained, free-spirited, and without affectation. Reading his diaries published in "Leisurely Books" particularly reveals his genuine personality. His essays are like everyday home-cooked meals.

(5) Feng Zikai: Mr. Zikai is an artist and a religious figure. His writing is sincere and intimate, like family members casually chatting at home, without pretension or pomposity. It's like vegetarian dishes from a temple kitchen, subtle, fragrant, and clean, beneficial to both body and mind.

### Morning Dew

— Y

Life is a string of suffering; living is being taught how to endure it with a smile.

People often argue because they are not good at debating.

Worry is like a rocking chair; it keeps you busy going back and forth, but you never get anywhere.

Who dares to say they are not in a dream but laughs at others' yearning for dreams?

A passionate lover clings to the dream world; a philosopher waits for the dream to end; a common person doesn't realize it's a dream.

### Preface to the Fifth Edition of the New Provincial Map of China

— Weng Wenhao

The New Provincial Map of China was created to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Shen Bao. The first edition was published in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. With its accurate position, clear elevation, thorough references, and distinct colors, it became popular for a time and was repeatedly reprinted to serve its readers. By the 28th year [1939], it had been printed to the fourth edition, but due to the ongoing war of resistance, although there was a great need, it was not reprinted. It has been ten years since the fourth edition. The gentlemen in charge of Shen Bao believe that the map is of great importance and that the previous efforts should not be interrupted. They have spared no expense, engaging Mr. Zeng Shiying and Mr. Fang Jun to collect data, compile, and create this fifth edition of the new map. Now, after victory, with Taiwan and the Northeast returned to our territory, this new edition of the map commemorates the solidity of our nation. The task is weighty and the road is long, worthy of remembrance.

The compilation of a map depends on survey data. In the past ten years, China's longitude and latitude measurements have increased significantly; topographic, hydrological, geological, and engineering maps have also contributed much; in addition, there is aerial surveying by the United States, and maps of the Northeast and Taiwan by Japan. The Central Geological Survey has collected much of this data, and Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang have also widely collected it for reference. Therefore, the foundation upon which this fifth edition is based is far superior to previous editions. As for the division of provinces in the Northeast, the correction of place names of cities and counties, and the addition of railways and seaports, all recent geographic additions have been carefully verified and incorporated.

The compilation of a map also depends on the application of cartography. Compiling a new map is not merely copying existing maps. Elevation must have a unified standard, projection must use a specific method, and there should be a practical understanding of terrain and rivers. The quality of the compilation depends on the knowledge of the mapmakers. Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang have devoted themselves to mapmaking for many years. Mr. Zeng also participated in mapmaking tasks for the US government during the war, gaining more experience with modern methods. With these two gentlemen in charge of the compilation of this new edition, great results can be expected. Recalling how Zou Daijun of Hunan devoted himself to European cartographic methods because of his involvement in border negotiations, which later had successors, the maps of Yaxin began there. The Shen Bao commemorative map was initiated by Ding Wenjiang with his geological mapping passion. Now, with the efforts of Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang, this new edition has been completed, surpassing previous ones. This is a noteworthy event in the history of Chinese cartography.

The compilation of a map should also emphasize the recognition of facts and avoid the misrepresentation of established theories. Ancient Chinese mapmaking excelled at recording water but struggled with depicting mountains, mistakenly believing that there must be mountains between two rivers, not knowing that mountains are often cut across by waterways; mistakenly believing that the types of terrain are limited to mountains and plains, not knowing that plateaus, hills, basins, deserts, and alluvial islands have different origins and unique importance. In the past, relying on ideal theories often led to neglecting the underlying facts. Now, using modern methods to create maps based on reality, the facts are clear and the truth is very obvious. This will also help to improve our knowledge of the country's actual conditions.

Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang will continue to work tirelessly on mapmaking; the Shen Bao will continue to provide assistance so that it can be published. The first step in this achievement is this fifth edition of the new map; publication is imminent, and I dare to introduce it.
