He also said: The situation in the Northeast is not as serious as rumored, but if it is to be developed, new forces must be added. The method requires everyone to think of it and only by working steadily can it be successful. The inclination of Northeastern compatriots towards the central government is very sincere now, so we should seize the opportunity and urgently seek to save it.

After all, many Northeastern compatriots still do not understand what the government's policy for governing the Northeast is.

### Central Government's Two Local Subsidy Payments; Ministry of Finance Has Disbursed Separately; Total for All Provinces Nationwide Approximately Two Trillion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Regarding the local finances of various provinces for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948], the Central Government has decided to continue subsidies. The interim measures for these subsidies have also been submitted by Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun to the Executive Yuan for approval and were announced on the 16th at the local finance review meeting he convened. The measures are as follows: A. The Central Government will initially advance three months' worth of the 37th year's central subsidies to each province, based on the standard of last December. B. The Central Government will initially advance 70% of the amount exceeding last year's public servant living allowance, adjusted according to the cost of living index, for three months. The aforementioned two items of central government subsidies have been disbursed separately by the Ministry of Finance. The finance directors of provinces who are in the capital have already collected them from the Ministry of Finance, while the Ministry of Finance will remit funds to other provinces. Public servant living allowances can also be issued within a week. The total amount of the two subsidy payments for all provinces nationwide is approximately two trillion. Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, the two subsidies amount to over 110 billion yuan. However, for the aforementioned two subsidies, each province must still draft a budget and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for onward submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Central Government has historically provided minimal subsidies for the operating expenses of each province, and in the future, each province will still need to raise funds independently, and the Central Government will not provide subsidies. The financial situation of Shanghai Municipality is better than that of other provinces and municipalities nationwide. In principle, the Ministry of Finance hopes that Shanghai Municipality can achieve self-sufficiency after reorganizing its tax revenue and no longer requires central government subsidies. Furthermore, the points decided at the local finance review meeting on the 16th and the opinions raised by the finance directors of each province are currently being compiled by the Local Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance. The finance directors of each province who attended the meeting can also draft written opinions regarding local finance and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for compilation. After a comprehensive plan is formulated and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, it can be implemented.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The finance directors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Jehol, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces have arrived in the capital one after another to request subsidies from the Central Government, and a result has been reached. A solution has also been agreed upon regarding the issue of raising funds for local defense expenses, and they will return to their posts within one or two days.

Editorial

### The Emergence of the North Korean Puppet Government!

The endlessly disputed Korean issue has now entered a new and serious stage. According to the Pyongyang Radio Station in Soviet-controlled North Korea, the "Democratic People's Republic" has been established in the Soviet-occupied zone of North Korea, and the "North Korean People's Army" has been established. The organization of this government adopts the Soviet system. Kim Il-sung is the Chairman of the People's Committee. The constitution stipulates that the national flag is white with a red horizontal stripe, and the national emblem is a white background with a red star, surrounded by two crossed hammers and sickles each, rice stalks, steelworkers, and a mountain. The United Nations and the United States are paying close attention to this situation. The members of the United Nations Commission on Korea, who are working in South Korea, have successively withdrawn to Lake Success to attend the UN Small Assembly on the 19th to prepare a report on the overall Korean issue. These facts symbolize the failure of the United Nations Commission on Korea, the Soviet Union's deliberate split of Korea, and the unconscious and disunited crisis of North and South Korea. From now on, it will bring new and serious disasters to the Far East and the future world!

Korea, also known as the Korean Peninsula, is one of the most disputed and troubled areas after the war. Frankly speaking, the creation of these disputes and troubles was a serious mistake made by the secret diplomacy of the Cairo, Potsdam, and Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conferences, which arranged a tragedy for Korea early on! Although the Cairo Conference in October 1943 provided a guarantee for the independence and freedom of Korea, it regrettably stated that "Korea will be made free and independent in due course." Because independence still requires a "due course," this guarantee was half-failed. The Potsdam Conference's decision to divide Korea at the 38th parallel, with American and Soviet troops occupying the north and south respectively, was especially ridiculously wrong. At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union further requested territorial concessions for certain islands in Korea in order to restore the rights seized during the Tsarist era. President Roosevelt, due to illness, accepted this in a state of confusion. The Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in December of the same year decided that the United States and the Soviet Union would divide Korea north and south, and a mixed commission would be formed by representatives of the military command headquarters to assist in the establishment of a Korean provisional government, and then establish a unified democratic autonomous government. However, before Korea is fully independent, it must undergo five years of trusteeship. The Korean people opposed trusteeship and opposed the division of the north and south by American and Soviet troops. However, based on the errors of the international conference, the powerful countries ignored Korean opposition and insisted on continuing the error, wearing armor and carrying spears, and forcibly entered Korea, reluctantly building a barrier at the 38th parallel, and splitting the good, whole Korea into two regions!

From the establishment of the US-Soviet Mixed Commission in Seoul in March 1946 until the adoption of the seven resolutions by the UN General Assembly on November 14 last year, there was little harmony and a lack of cooperation. The UN plan stipulated the organization of a Korean Commission, with representatives from nine countries to work in Korea, supervise the general election in Korea, and assist in government organization. On January 8 this year, representatives from various countries gathered in Seoul and elected Indian representative Menon as chairman, deciding to set March 31 as the general election date. The Commission encountered numerous difficulties in its one month of work in Korea: on the one hand, the Soviet Union's uncooperative attitude, Ukraine's non-participation in the Commission, and North Korea's refusal to allow the Commission to go north of the 38th parallel made the Commission members feel both ridiculous and helpless. On the other hand, the divisions among South Korean political parties, the stubbornness of Syngman Rhee, Kim Gu, and others, and the strikes and sabotage by the South Korean communists made the Commission's work even more difficult. The Commission could not break through the political divide between North and South Korea, could not obtain Soviet cooperation, and the various parties and factions in Korea were concerned about ideological orientations, and were unaware of self-awareness and self-improvement, and could not be persuaded by the neutral members of the Commission. Under these circumstances, the Commission's work was at a standstill. Menon left with a feeling of disappointment, preparing to draft a report on this chaotic situation for discussion by the Small Assembly.

The Small Assembly's countermeasures to the Korean issue will be worthy of attention. Looking at the trend, the Small Assembly may accept the Commission's proposal to temporarily complete the election in South Korea and organize a provisional government, pending cooperation from North Korea. In order to counter the future decisions of the Small Assembly and seize the initiative, the Soviet Union suddenly announced the establishment of the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" when the United Nations Commission was leaving Korea. From then on, the puppet came on stage, the barriers were fortified, and the tragedy of the Korean nation began. We attach importance to this situation, are concerned about the development of the Korean division, and have to point out the serious impact of this issue on the Far East today when Pyongyang Radio announced the emergence of the North Korean Republic:

(1) The emergence of the North Korean Republic not only violates the decisions of the Cairo, Potsdam, and Yalta conferences, but also violates the Moscow Agreement and the repeated decisions of the United Nations. The Soviet Union's unilateral action is a threat to the United States and the United Nations, and even has a latent effect on China and Japan. The Communist army in Northeast China is connected to North Korea. In the future, the Communist coup in China will follow in the footsteps of North Korea, and a new puppet Manchuria can appear in Northeast China at any time. If this red puppet Manchuria, unfortunately, forms a red fortress in the Far East with Outer Mongolia and North Korea, it will bring a serious threat to the Far East, a new crisis to the world, and an unimaginable future to human catastrophe, which will be no different from the puppet Manchuria created by Japan after the September 18th Incident, and even surpass it.

(2) The emergence of the North Korean Republic illustrates the Soviet Union's attempt to sweep through the entire Korean peninsula. The North Korean government currently has more than 200,000 troops, while South Korea claims to be democratic but is unarmed; North Korea has a large amount of arms stockpiles, while South Korea has no self-defense reserves. American observers predict that after the emergence of the North Korean government, the Soviet army will superficially withdraw from Korea, and North Korea's provocative actions against South Korea will cross the 38th parallel, and even attack key points in South Korea, to complete the "unification" of the entire Korea in their minds. Soviet propagandists tell the world that the Soviet army's withdrawal is not responsible for the Korean civil war, the same as the Soviet army's withdrawal from Changchun and Shenyang at that time. In fact, the Korean civil war is a plan prearranged by the Soviet Union to sweep through the entire Korean peninsula. Now shadows are looming over North and South Korea, and the prelude to the civil war has already begun with the emergence of the North Korean Republic.

(3) The emergence of the North Korean Republic and the Soviet army's preparation for withdrawal will have a new impact on the US attitude. If the United States can no longer tolerate the development of this situation, withdraws from South Korea, and retreats to protect Japan, it will inevitably accept North Korea's provocations and evolve the Korean civil war into an international war. Whether the United States' current hesitation on its attitude towards the Far East will be forced to embark on this path is difficult for us to predict at this time. However, it is expected that the US policy toward the Far East will have to make new decisions and changes because of this.

In short, the emergence of the North Korean Republic brings a painful and pitiable tragedy to Korea. We feel infinite sorrow for the future of Korean independence and the future situation in the Far East. The current crisis conceals a dark scene of turmoil and the shadow of the god of war. If the United States is still indecisive, if the United Nations is still weak and powerless, the future of the Far East will be more misfortune than fortune!

### Envoy Denies Evacuation of Nationals

[Continued from Page One] The envoy stated, "Although the situation is serious, we are paying attention to it every day to avoid a sudden crisis that we cannot handle, but it is not so serious that we need to consider evacuating nationals. The embassy is only advising American nationals in the war zone to evacuate, not in a mandatory manner." Although British Ambassador to China Steve Stevenson notified unnecessary British nationals in North China, especially women and children, to evacuate to Shanghai yesterday, the US State Department has not issued such a notice. The envoy also firmly denied that American nationals in Qingdao have been ordered to evacuate, as well as those in Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. If the aforementioned locations are under serious and dangerous attack by the Communist army, then American nationals will naturally evacuate. The envoy also acknowledged that the State Department and the US military authorities in China have a complete evacuation plan, "This plan is revised at any time according to changes in the situation, but it is a routine matter. The embassy and the army and navy each have their own plans and often refer to each other for coordination. Although the content cannot be disclosed, it is ensured that all American nationals will be protected in any emergency. The United States has many aircraft and ships in China and other parts of the Far East, which are sufficient for transportation, which is something the UK cannot match. In view of this, the British side has to plan ahead. The US side, on the other hand, is currently taking a defensive stance and does not need to take further action. As for whether the staff and their families at the consulate in Shenyang need to evacuate, there is no specific decision. In short, everything depends on the environment." The US military authorities are well aware that the Communist army has not changed its strategy of avoiding strong points and attacking weak points.

### Tin and Grain Prices Soar; Decision on Control Measures

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 17th] Rice and grain prices in Wuxi are rising sharply. The county government implemented emergency measures, dispatched a large number of personnel to the market to suppress prices, and the market situation has stabilized slightly. Top-quality white rice is traded at 1.9 million to 1.92 million, top-quality white indica rice at 1.88 million, top-quality white yuan rice at 1.93 million, Heshang rice at 830,000, __ rice at 815,000, Indica rice at 795,000, Yuan rice at 835,000, wheat at 2.22 million, white wheat at 2.27 million, naval vessel flour at 888,000, soybean oil at 4.48 million, and double-rain yarn at 46.2 million, all breaking new highs. County Magistrate Xu, Chairman of the County Grain Management Committee, convened a meeting of leaders of relevant industries at 2 p.m. this afternoon to stabilize grain prices and decided on five measures for grain price control: (1) The selling price of top-quality white rice is adjusted to 1.75 million, and retail price is 1.83 million. (2) Grain merchants and rice mills should absolutely be responsible for supplying retail sales. If there is a shortage of goods, causing disorder, they should be fully responsible. (3) Speculators will be investigated and prosecuted by the Land and Grain Department. (4) The price of wheat should not be too far from that of rice. Those who have hoarded for more than a month should be ordered to sell. (5) There is still a lot of soybean inventory in this city, but the price is rising, which is unreasonable. The county government will check the warehouse receipts and quantities of the warehouse and oil factories, and then study ways to stabilize prices.

### Rice Prices in Suzhou and Zhenjiang All Rise

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 17th] After the Spring Festival, grain prices in various parts of Sichuan Province have risen sharply.

### Zhang Jia'ao Discusses Developing Taiwan's Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Taiwan, Pledging to Raise 9 Million US Dollars to Improve Railways and Electricity

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 17th] Zhang Jia'ao talked to reporters at one o'clock in the afternoon on the seventeenth: The railways in the province urgently need to replenish equipment. Vehicles, sleepers, strengthen transportation. Electricity also needs to be supplemented. The central government allocated 80,000 tons of fertilizer, which is still insufficient, and it is hoped that new plants will be added. He has little hope of exchanging foreign currency for local specialties in the province. The adjustment of the combined currency at any time is recognized as the expression of central support. He also said: State-provincial and private enterprises should cooperate and link up, and foreign investment must be carried out under our economic construction plan. He especially emphasized that the central government must not fail to support those that are beneficial, and he hoped that those who come to Taiwan from the mainland will work hard to study, because the Japanese spent years building Taiwan, and we should not deal with things casually. He has indeed promised to raise 9 million US dollars to improve railways and electricity, and has promised to support private enterprises and supply public companies with legal currency head offices.

Zhang believes that in order to engage in the construction of Taiwan, psychological design must be listed first, and economic construction must be listed second. If you want to seek economic construction, you must base it on psychological 魏. Taiwan's industrial and mining industries are not rich in congenital conditions, and all depend on human efforts to promote them, which is much inferior to the northeast. He believes that railway transportation and electricity are the most urgent business items that should be paid special attention to at present. The current daily railway transportation capacity in Taiwan Province is only 12,000 tons. The main goods transported are sugar, coal, and rice. Taking sugar alone, only 12,000 tons of sugar are transported per month. However, Taiwan Sugar Company produced 300,000 tons of sugar this year, which is difficult to transport and export in its entirety. Therefore, more warehouses must be built, and it may even affect the plan to produce 500,000 tons of sugar next year. Zhang also said: Fertilizer and sugar production are closely related to the lives of farmers in Taiwan, and the importance of these two industries is second only to railways and electricity. Zhang believes that the enterprises that should be paid attention to are industries that can exchange foreign currency, such as cement, tea, and brains, and industries that can save foreign exchange expenditures, such as petroleum, papermaking, and alkali production. When talking about the coal industry, Zhang believed that the coal produced in Taiwan, due to the result of shipping it all to Shanghai in the past, has reduced the production volume of some industries in Taiwan due to the lack of coking coal. For example, the switch factory and the cement factory are all feeling the shortage of coal. Zhang said: "I have paid the greatest attention to allocating funds to assist the development of Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises, but all specific plans need to be carefully considered after returning to Shanghai."

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] The Xinying Pulp Mill, jointly operated by the Resource Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government, is the largest in our country. It started operations on the sixteenth. The factory uses sugar cane bagasse from the sugar factory to manufacture pulp. The maximum output can reach 80 tons per day. Currently, it can produce 70 tons per day, but due to limited raw materials, it only produces 40 tons per day. According to Gao Yongxiang, the director of the factory, in addition to meeting the needs of public and private paper mills in Taiwan, half of the pulp produced by the factory can still be sold to Shanghai. Cai Yingchang Yan Jiakan said: This paper mill has six new-style cooking pots, and if used for cooking, it can feed 2 million of the 6 million Taiwanese people.

### 1,500 Tons of Cement from Taiwan, First Batch Sold to the Philippines

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] The first batch of 1,500 tons of cement from Taiwan sold abroad was shipped from Kaohsiung to Manila by the Chinese merchant "Taiping Wheel" on the 17th. According to Xu Zongchen, general manager of Taiwan Cement Company, the company's current monthly output is 20,000 tons, and it will increase to 40,000 tons after September this year. All products will be given priority for use in Taiwan Province. When there is surplus, priority will be given to sales in Southeast Asia, and sales in Fujian and Guangdong provinces will be second. Today, the government's need for foreign exchange is the most urgent. The 1,500 tons sold to the Philippines this time are priced at 20 US dollars per ton, delivered in Kaohsiung, and are for trial sales. When the output increases in the future, it can be sold to Southeast Asia in large quantities.

### US Attitude Remains Firm on the Soviet Union's Unilateral Actions in North Korea, Insisting on a Comprehensive Solution by the United Nations

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] According to authoritative sources, the United States will continue to insist on a United Nations solution to the entire Korean problem, regardless of the Soviet Union's unilateral action in establishing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea. The United States believes that the Soviet Union's action is clearly a propaganda ploy and was expected. US officials said that although the Soviet Union has established a government in North Korea, it would be unwise for the United States to establish an independent state in South Korea as well. The Soviet Union's action is clearly intended to confuse the United States and the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea. The United States hopes that the United Nations Little Assembly, considering the further suggestive application made by the commission to Korea, will decide that elections should be held in South Korea to establish a legislative body, and that the United Nations or the United States should retain the high authority to send military forces to guarantee the integrity of South Korea.

[Reuters, New York, 17th] The New York Times reporter in Seoul reported that US authorities' reaction to the announcement of the establishment of the People's Republic of North Korea was very straightforward and indignant. One senior US authority spokesman said, "We are acting entirely in accordance with international agreements, and we have never violated any international agreements in letter or spirit. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union ignored the Moscow agreement and the authority of the United Nations, and engaged in acts of betraying the agreement secretly and then publicly, establishing a huge army in the north, which is a clear breach of contract, and it is by no means possible to complete it in a few months. The United States has repeatedly attempted to establish a solution to the Korean problem, first seeking cooperation with the Soviet Union to no avail, and then seeking a solution with the support and cooperation of the United Nations, but each effort has been thwarted. US authorities believe that the Soviet Union intends to get ahead of the United Nations in establishing an accomplished fact, and the Soviet Union has decided to go its own way regardless of the outcome of the Little Assembly's discussion of the United Nations.

[United Press to Washington, 16th] Whether the Soviet Union's announcement of its determination to withdraw the Red Army from Korea is credible is still being debated. If all sides believe that, because the North Korean radio station strongly advocated the summoning of all Korean troops to defend Korea, the Soviet Union may announce the withdrawal of Korean troops stationed in Korea.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Sims, the international news editor of the Scripps-Howard system in the United States, said today that destiny seems to have been doomed, and Korea has become the Poland of the Far East. He pointed out the seriousness of the situation in Northeast China and warned that Japan is also in danger of turning red, and as a result, the entire Asia will also turn red. This kind of disaster is even worse than the threat of Japan before. If the UN Commission decides to hold elections in the US-occupied area of Korea, it will not achieve anything. He speculated that since the Sovietized regime has been established in North Korea, there is a highly organized Korean Communist Party, and there is a large army of 200,000 to support it. Once the US and Soviet troops withdraw, the Korean government under Soviet rule will be established.

### North Korean Radio Broadcasts the Organization of the Republic

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: According to a news broadcast by the Pinghuai radio station with Soviet approval, the cabinet of the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" will consist of one prime minister, one deputy prime minister, one chairman of the National Planning Committee, and 17 ministers. The People's Committee elected by the people will govern the provinces, cities, towns, and villages. The flag of the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" has a cauldron in the middle, with a mountain as the background, and a red star on it. In the middle are crossed iron hammers, and crossed knives on the left and right. The constitution emphasizes agricultural reform and places all activities under state control, including foreign trade.

### Menon, Hu Shize, and Others Arrive in New York, Expressing Surprise at the North Korean Matter, and the Actual Situation in Korea Will Be Reported to the United Nations

[United Press, New York, 16th] The Chairman of the United Nations Korean Commission, Indian representative Menon, arrived at LaGuardia Airport in New York by plane on the sixteenth. He said in a speech that he would report to the United Nations Little Assembly on the 19th on the difficulties in implementing the United Nations General Assembly resolution to establish an independent Korea. Those who arrived at the same time as Menon included Dr. Hu Shize, Secretary-General of the Commission and Chinese Representative, and Jacobs, political adviser to General Hodge, Commander of the US Army in Korea. Menon, who stayed in Korea for five weeks, said: "He was very surprised to hear about the establishment of the Soviet puppet government in North Korea and pointed out that the Korean people are very eager to maintain unity because they have been unified for many centuries."

[United Press, Manila, 17th] The Philippine representative to the United Nations Korean Commission, Lunz, said today that the United Nations should take decisive measures against the establishment of a "puppet communist government" in the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's purpose is to establish a communist government for the entire Korea. If the United Nations fails to take decisive measures, it will be impossible to establish a democratic Korean government. Lunz pointed out that the Soviet Union is trying to provoke an internal chaos in Korea, so that the Communist Party can control the entire country through the Korean army organized by the Soviet Union in North Korea. He said that the Soviet Union has "established a so-called democratic government headed by Kim Il-sung in North Korea. Kim is a member of the Communist Party and returned from the Soviet Union in 1945." According to his estimates, the number of North Korean troops is approximately 400,000.

### South Korea Expresses Great Concern Over the Establishment of the Government in North Korea

### Pinghuai Radio Station Criticizes US Policy

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 17th] The announcement of the establishment of the "People's Republic" in North Korea has caused great concern among the people here, because North Korea's move was so secret and rapid that it was beyond ordinary expectations. Therefore, they all expressed regret for the slow actions of the United Nations Korean Commission. Also: People here pay close attention to the enthusiastic participation of the people of North Korea in the discussion of the newly promulgated draft constitution of North Korea, and the propaganda activities in the streets of Pinghuai to support the new republic.

[Reuters, New York, 17th] A commentator on North Korean radio yesterday criticized General Hodge, the commander-in-chief of the US military in South Korea, for being willing to become a war profiteer. He said: "Hodge is ordered by US imperialists to implement a colonial policy in South Korea, trying to make South Korea a military base for aggression in Asia." The commentator also said that North Korea's refusal to allow the United Nations Commission to go there was because it understood that the purpose of the Commission was only to make Korea a colony of the United States.

### Two US Military Officers Once Detained in Pyongyang

[United Press, Seoul, 17th] US military authorities announced on the 17th that two US liaison officers stationed in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, Majors Costello and Biggs, had a dispute with Korean military officers, civilians, and police on February 8 while attending the parade commemorating the second anniversary of the establishment of the North Korean People's Committee and the anniversary of the establishment of the Korean Army, resulting in them being detained in their jeep for half an hour.

### US Authorities in Tokyo Attach Importance to the North Korean Incident

[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] US authorities here are taking the Korean situation very seriously, believing that riots may occur in South Korea from the beginning of April, and even war may break out between North and South Korea. US authorities also believe that the Soviet army's unilateral withdrawal from Korea before April will make the situation even more serious.

### US Responds to Soviet Accusations, Explains Reasons for Delaying the Offensive in Europe

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th, United Press] US Army officials said that the Soviet Union's accusation that the Western powers delayed the opening of the second battlefield in Europe in order to exhaust the Soviet Union was a lie. The reason why the Allies did not cross the strait to attack the European continent until June 7, 1944 was due to the lack of sufficient troops and landing craft. The Soviet Union made this accusation against the Western Allies in its recent statement. The Soviet statement stated that the Western Allies promised to open the second war in 1942 or 1943, but delayed in fulfilling their promise, so that the Soviet Union could not become a major power after the war due to the damage it suffered.

### British Fleet Exercises

[Reuters, London, 17th] The British Home Fleet sailed to Gibraltar today to participate in the annual spring exercises, scheduled to return home on March 20.

### Our Foreign Ministry Will Issue a Statement on the Independence of Korea, the Representative of South Korea in China Hopes for Korean Unification

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the Soviet Union's establishment of the Democratic People's Republic in the North Korean occupied zone, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a report from our Consul General in Seoul, Liu Yuwan, based on the Soviet broadcast in Pinghuai. Min Shilin, a spokesman for the Korean Provisional Government's representative office in China, said that North Korea's move came much later than they had expected, and that the government of the Republic was transformed from the former "People's Committee". Mr. Min said: The Korean people all hope that a unified government will appear, but the hope can never be realized under the occupation of two extreme forces with different intentions. The Soviet Union has caused terrible famine in North Korea, while the United States has reused pro-Japanese right-wing elements in South Korea. They believe that the Korean people have the right to handle their own problems and do not want any external forces to continue to meddle in and mess things up. Our Foreign Ministry did not criticize this view, but may reiterate our advocacy for the unification and independence of Korea at the press conference on the 18th.

### The Situation in Palestine is Critical, Truman Calls for Peace, the United Nations Committee Recommends the Use of Force to Implement Partition

[United Press, Washington, 17th] White House Secretary Ross announced that the President, in view of the seriousness of the situation in Palestine, has personally called for peace to the countries in the Middle East. For several weeks, the outside world has been spreading the word that Arab leaders opposed the United Nations plan to split Palestine, threatening to launch a "holy war." Truman's call was directed at them. The original text of the White House notice is as follows: "In order to try to prevent the spread of chaos in the Middle East, the US government has issued appeals to the governments concerned in recent months, emphasizing the importance of tolerance in dealing with the situation in Palestine for the sake of interests in the Middle East and world peace and security." Ross refused to disclose the targets of the appeal and said that its nature was purely "confidential" and there was no hope of publishing it in the near future.

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] White House sources said today: President Truman's call was sent to the leaders of the seven countries of the Arab League. It was reported that the Iraqi government stated that it had received Truman's telegram, urging Iraq to do its best to stabilize the situation in Palestine. Iraq believes that the United States must first strictly maintain neutrality in order to do its own part.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations Palestine Committee submitted a report to the Security Council tonight, advocating that the Security Council organize an international army to implement the partition of Palestine. The report, 19 pages long, was unanimously adopted by the committee. Its main points are as follows: (1) The Palestine Committee cannot maintain law and order without adequate military force. (2) Strong Arab forces inside and outside Palestine are trying to change the resolution of the General Assembly by force. (3) Some irresponsible elements of the Jewish race continue to engage in violent actions, which make the situation worse. (4) Britain's refusal to allow the establishment of Jewish militias before the end of the committee's rule will delay the implementation of the partition. (5) Unless another non-Palestinian army replaces the British army, Jerusalem will not be able to defend itself. (6) If the United Nations does not provide troops, the Palestine Committee will not be able to carry out its mission. (7) After the end of the committee's rule, if there are no organized militias in both the Jewish and Arab countries, an extremely serious situation will occur. The Palestine Committee believes that the future welfare of the Palestinian people and the authority of the United Nations are deeply affected.

### London Conference Announced Postponed; Unrelated to Soviet Protest; Three Eastern European Nations to Confer on Relations with Germany

[Central News Agency, London, 16th Day, Comprehensive Dispatch] Following the Soviet Union's accusation that Western Allied nations intend to dismantle the Foreign Ministers' Conference and seize its authority, it was announced here today that the date for the Three-Power Conference to discuss the German problem has been postponed from the 19th to the 23rd. The postponement was suggested by the United States. It is said that the postponement is unrelated to the Soviet Union's criticism of the conference.

A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry in Paris stated that the U.S. State Department wishes its ambassador to the UK, Douglas, to remain in Washington this week during the U.S. Congressional review of the European Recovery Program. A British Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the American proposal had been received before the end of last week, as Ambassador Douglas would be unable to arrive here before the 23rd.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th Day] Speculation is rife here regarding the reason for the postponement of the Anglo-American-French conference on the German problem. It is generally believed that this is due to the attitude of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as these three countries have requested full participation in the conference and wish to resolve this issue before the conference opens. The explanation that the postponement is due to the inability of the U.S. Ambassador to the UK, Douglas, to attend is hardly credible.

[United Press, Prague, 17th Day] The Foreign Ministers of Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia officially began a two-day meeting on the 17th to discuss relations with Germany. The Czech Foreign Minister, Masaryk, as host, gave an opening speech stating that the meeting could freely discuss other issues.

### Antarctic Land Dispute; Relations Between Britain, Argentina, and Chile Deteriorate

[Reuters, London, 16th Day] Undersecretary McNeil stated in the House of Commons that Britain will not ignore provocations by other parties regarding British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. The British government has taken steps to ensure that the Governor of the Falkland Islands receives any necessary assistance. Although the dispute over Antarctic land claims has long existed, no one has ever used this matter to incite international resentment. Britain is confident that the governments of Argentina and Chile can agree to refrain from provocative actions on this matter. The Argentine and Chilean navies are now demonstrating in British territorial waters around the Falkland Islands, and have declared that they will demand sovereignty over the area and have dispatched troops to land, intending to establish a headquarters in British territory. The British government believes that British sovereignty is beyond dispute and is willing to submit the matter to the International Court of Justice, which has been rejected by Argentina and Chile. Argentina has also suggested convening an international conference, which Britain is considering.

[Reuters, Johannesburg, 16th Day] The 8,000-ton British cruiser "Nigeria," which left Simon's Town yesterday under secret orders, is heading to the British Falkland Islands in Antarctica. Chilean President Videla has departed for Greenwich Island in the Falkland Islands to preside over the establishment ceremony of a Chilean army base. Unconfirmed reports state that Argentine President Perón will also travel to Antarctica to meet with the Chilean President. It is understood that the Falkland Islands consist of over two hundred islands. Argentina has already established a weather station on Deception Island, while Britain maintains that all Falkland Islands belong to British sovereignty.

[Associated Press, London, 16th Day] The "News Chronicle" reported today that Argentina and Chile's pursuit of sovereignty over the British Falkland Islands, which produce minerals, is the motivation behind their actions.

### Next UN General Assembly; Scheduled for September 23rd in Paris

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th Day] The official bulletin states that the Nine-Member Committee advocated that Paris be the venue for the next UN General Assembly in Europe, so Secretary-General Lie has decided that the Assembly will open in Paris on September 23rd of this year.

### Soviet Finance Minister Replaced

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 17th Day] Kosygin, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and a close aide to Soviet Premier Stalin, has recently been replaced by Zverev as the Soviet Finance Minister, with Zverev being reassigned as First Deputy Minister of Finance.

### Soviet Union and Hungary Conclude Mutual Assistance Treaty

[Reuters, London, 16th Day] Moscow Radio reports that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the head of the Hungarian delegation tonight to discuss the conclusion of a Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance. Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Rakosi and Foreign Minister Molnar also participated in the meeting.

### Japan Selects New Prime Minister; Decision Expected Within Days; Coalition Cabinet Highly Likely

[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th Day] The House of Representatives will elect a new Prime Minister within the week. Due to the competition among the major political parties and their unwillingness to concede, the possibility of a coalition cabinet is considered most likely. There are currently two possible developments: (1) Liberal Party leader Shigeru Yoshida or Democratic Party leader Hitoshi Ashida will become Prime Minister, forming a coalition cabinet with the Liberal, Democratic, People's Cooperative, and several smaller parties; (2) Hitoshi Ashida will lead the organization of a coalition cabinet of the Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the People's Cooperative Party, with the Liberal Party becoming the opposition party.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Day, United Press Dispatch] The selection of the Japanese Prime Minister will accelerate after the Allied Council for Japan convenes tomorrow. The meeting of the Council will be closely watched by the leaders of the political parties, who are currently in a stalemate.

Striving for Victory and the Premise Determines Everything

On June 22, 1941, when the news of Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union reached me, I was ill at home. I immediately called the President and then Undersecretary of State Welles. I said the same thing to both of them:

"We must give the Soviet Union all possible assistance, by every means possible. We have repeatedly said that we will do our utmost to give all assistance to any country that resists the Axis. The Soviet Union falls into this category, without any hesitation."

I knew that some military experts, both here and abroad, expected Hitler to destroy the Soviet Union in a matter of weeks in the war. But I could not believe this, just as I could not believe the many claims that after the fall of France, Britain's collapse would be a matter of weeks. When we shipped large quantities of weapons to Britain in the summer of 1940, I did not feel that we were taking a real risk of those weapons falling into German hands. I also believed that we could send all the weapons and supplies we could possibly get to the Soviet Union without the real danger of them being seized by the Germans. If the President and I doubted the Soviet Union's ability to resist Germany, then it would have been too foolish to send weapons to the Soviet Union while clearly believing that the weapons would fall into Hitler's hands.

For six months we had good reason to believe that Hitler would attack the Soviet Union, so the events of June 22 did not surprise us.

In January 1941, our Commercial Attaché in Berlin, Huth, received a secret report. Huth had a German friend who, although an enemy of the Nazis, had close ties with various German ministries, the Deutsche Bank, and high-ranking Nazi Party members. As early as August 1940, this friend notified Huth that Hitler's High Command was holding meetings to prepare for a war of aggression against the Soviet Union. This news became more concrete a few weeks later, when Hitler reportedly said that he wanted "only my soldiers from Vladivostok to Gibraltar."

Huth often met this friend in a Berlin cinema. This friend reserved seats through an agency, sent two tickets to Huth, tried to sit next to him, and slipped notes into Huth's bag in the semi-darkness.

The news from Huth, and the considerable evidence that Hitler was planning to invade Britain, seemed contradictory. But the result of contact with Huth's friend was that the air raids on Britain were merely a smokescreen to cover Hitler's real, carefully calculated plan to launch a sudden and fierce attack on the Soviet Union.

Later, Huth's friend notified him that the German war machine was organizing twenty-one old government regions of the Tsarist era of Russia, which had already been established, and that the economic staff for these areas had already been appointed. Bundles of ruble notes had already been printed.

Finally, Huth learned the key points of Hitler's military strategy after contacting the German General Staff through his friend - that is, to divide it into three wedge shapes, the northern, the southern, and the decisive central route, directly targeting Moscow. All preparations must be completed in the spring of 1941. When Huth's reports on all this information reached my office, it was so sudden that I initially thought it was a German "ruse." I gave it to FBI Director Hoover and asked for his opinion. Hoover believed it was genuine. Huth told me of a way to have these reports confirmed by a prominent German exile in the United States, so I asked Assistant Secretary of State Langer to see him to obtain this confirmation, which he did. I also discussed the report with the President.

So I decided that the content of this report should be notified to the Soviet Ambassador Oumansky. I believed that this step was in line with the appropriate attitude that our country should adopt towards the Soviet Union. At that time, on my recommendation, Welles was holding a series of talks with Oumansky to try to eliminate the differences between our two countries, so I asked Welles to bring the information to the attention of the Soviet Ambassador. Welles did so.

When more information came to me from the same source, I gave it to Welles again and asked him to pass it on to Oumansky. He did this on March 20.

Oumansky undoubtedly sent this information to his government, just as he said he would. It is difficult to say what impact it had on Soviet policy. However, only three weeks later, Stalin suddenly signed a non-aggression treaty with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who at the time believed that such a treaty was impossible. Stalin undoubtedly signed this treaty in order to protect himself in the Far East, because he believed that Hitler wanted to attack him in Europe. Moreover, the policies adopted by the Soviet Union towards the Balkan countries before Hitler's plan to bring them into the Axis sphere were stronger than could have been expected.

The Soviet Union stimulated Hitler to engage in a European war in August 1939, and assisted him in invading Poland when Poland was desperately resisting the German army. But since June 1940, it has in many ways interfered with and obstructed Hitler's goals.

The news we obtained that Hitler was planning to invade the Soviet Union was useful when I met with the Japanese. It eliminated any possibility of a Soviet-Japanese alliance, and allowed us to deal with Japan with a stronger attitude than we could have adopted in the opposite situation.

Unfortunately, the discussions between Oumansky and Welles broke down, or rather, broke down in a sharp exchange. Oumansky always believed that firmness was rudeness, so he was the most difficult to deal with. Moreover, his government sent him here to request that we purchase more important materials, which Oumansky hoped to obtain, but due to our obligations to Britain, we were unable to do so.

On May 14, Oumansky came to see me, looking gloomy. In the first twenty minutes of our conversation, he listed the differences between our two governments. According to him, these differences had been discussed with Welles twenty-two times since the summer, with no results. He then handed me a note signed by himself, talking about a ship full of supplies being delayed from departing for the Soviet Union. His note spoke of our "hostility" and threatened that his government would "draw all necessary conclusions" from our attitude. He then repeated verbally two or three times that our actions were still due to hostility towards his government, and were a personal act of personal hostility.

I stopped him there and said, "When I think of a country, I think more of its people than of its government. Neither I nor my government have any animosity towards the people of any country. Regarding the Soviet Union and its government, neither I personally nor my government has any animosity. Involving individuals in the actions of the government is not only completely inaccurate, but also extremely unfair. I do not want you to leave my office thinking that you have succeeded in placing this accusation on the head of my government, because it is absolutely without foundation."

I said in closing that we have always been friends of the Soviet people, before and after we recognized the Soviet Union in 1933. The conversation was a little more lively at this point.

In the first week of June, we received credible telegrams from our embassies in Bucharest and Stockholm stating that Germany would invade the Soviet Union within two weeks. The State Department sent these reports to Ambassador Steinhardt in Moscow.

Eight days before Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Churchill sent a telegram to the President saying that every source from which he could obtain information led him to believe that a large-scale German offensive against the Soviet Union seemed imminent. He said that if a new war broke out, Britain, based on the principle that Hitler was the enemy it had to defeat, would of course assist the Soviet Union with all the encouragement and anything that could be spared. He assured that he did not feel that a class-conscious political reaction would occur in Britain, believing that the German-Soviet conflict would not put us in a difficult position.

The conflict did not put us in a difficult position, but gave me new hope for overcoming Hitlerism. I kept in constant contact with the President and Welles from White Sulphur Springs, urging us to give the Soviet Union the strongest assurances that we would give it all possible assistance within our capabilities. The President sent Hopkins from London to Moscow to investigate the Soviet Union's needs. Mr. Roosevelt unfroze Soviet funds and decided not to use the Neutrality Act. On August 2, Acting Secretary of State Welles and Ambassador Oumansky exchanged letters in which we allowed "the granting of all possible economic assistance to enhance the Soviet Union's struggle against armed aggression."

On August 4, I met with Oumansky, who brought Soviet General Golykov with him. Oumansky's attitude was very different from his attitude at our last meeting. I told him that when I was not here, especially after I returned, I was very interested in the Soviet Union receiving all the military supplies we could spare. General Golykov said that he had submitted his government's needs to the State Department two weeks ago, but the only result was the shipment of sixty aircraft to the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union most needed anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns. I promised to redouble our efforts to assist and expedite the shipment of these weapons.

While I was talking with the Soviet visitors, the President was holding the Atlantic Conference with Prime Minister Churchill. The Soviet Union attached great importance to this conference. Hopkins also attended the conference. After he gave an optimistic report on the Soviet Union's ability to resist Hitler's aggression, the President and Prime Minister reached an agreement on a statement to be issued to Stalin. On August 13, the President telegraphed this statement to me by radio, ordering me to telegraph it to Moscow.

The two leaders assured Stalin that "We are currently working together to supply you with the supplies you most urgently need in the greatest possible quantity, and many ships fully loaded with supplies have already left our shores, and more ships will set sail in the near future." They suggested holding a conference in Moscow to analyze the Soviet Union's needs, with senior representatives from Britain and the United States attending the Soviet Union.

The story of the Atlantic Conference has been told many times elsewhere. This conference was prepared while I was recuperating at White Sulphur Springs, and the President had already left for the conference when I returned to Washington. Mr. Roosevelt had wanted to hold a personal meeting with Churchill for several months. I first learned of this in late May.

On July 28, Welles wrote to me in White Sulphur Springs saying that the conference had been scheduled for August 8, 9, and 10, and told me that if the President wanted to discuss matters beyond purely military issues, he wanted to urge him to bring someone with him, so that the talks and possible agreements could be accurately recorded.

The conference was very successful in enabling the President and Prime Minister to achieve mutual understanding through close personal contact. On the British battleship "Prince of Wales" and our cruiser "Augusta," the two great men began this unique and intimate relationship, which was extremely important in accelerating the end of the war.

### Songjiang Searches and Suppresses Remnant Bandits; Ding Xishan Crosses the River and Flees North; Another Group Hides in Yanduntou; Armored Vehicles Patrol to Ensure Railway Safety

[Report from Our Newspaper] The small number of communist bandits who landed on the coast at the border between Songjiang and Fengxian counties on the 12th of this month have been divided into two groups and are fleeing everywhere after being encircled and defeated by the National Army, security teams, and local self-defense forces. At 11 p.m. the day before yesterday, more than 50 remnant bandits stealthily crossed the blockade line and fled north from east of Tinglin. They secretly crossed the Pujiang River at the Qianbu Jing Ferry, passed through Sijia Bang and Hexiang, crossed the railway between Cuizhuang and Xinqiao, turned west, and were discovered by the local self-defense forces at Maihuaqiao Town, a midway station on the Songsi Highway, 14 li from Songjiang City, at 8 a.m. yesterday. They were immediately attacked fiercely. The bandits were no match and fled to Tangqiao, 3 li from Sijing. At that time, the Qingpu County Self-Defense Force had received the news and rushed to the scene. After a brief encounter, the bandits retreated towards Yushan and Tianma Mountain. The Qingpu County troops followed closely in pursuit. The bandits did not dare to stay in the mountains for long, and the Third District Security Command had dispatched troops to strictly blockade the area west of Tianma Mountain. At about 6 p.m., the remnant bandits began to flee back towards Songjiang County. At about 7 p.m., they reached Shenxiang Township, more than 20 li from Songjiang City. The deputy commander of the ××× regiment of the ××× brigade of the National Army, Zheng Shen, immediately led his troops to suppress them after receiving the news. Another group of more than ten remnant bandits was discovered at Yanduntou, between Zhuangxing and Tinglin, at 5:30 p.m. The first battalion of the ××× brigade of the National Army, together with the self-defense forces of various townships in Punan, is encircling and suppressing them.

The seventh bridge of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway (between Xinzhuang and Xinqiao) and the thirty-fourth bridge (near Shihudang) also showed traces of bandits yesterday. Three screws were removed from the seventh bridge. The First Traffic Police Brigade stationed in Jiaxing and Songjiang, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Police Section of the two railway bureaus, are patrolling day and night to strengthen the security of the Shanghai-Songjiang-Jiaxing line. The captain of the Traffic Police Brigade, Li Boxi, and the chief of the Police Section, Xiang Younan, are staying at Songjiang Station overnight to direct the defense of the railway line. Traffic police and railway police are driving armored vehicles to patrol back and forth all night to ensure the safety of the railway. However, because the armored vehicles are patrolling too frequently, it has affected the train schedule. The 26th express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou was delayed by one hour yesterday because of this. When the train stopped at Zhouwangmiao Station to wait for traffic clearance, some passengers were misled by false rumors and got off the train. They were relieved and returned to Shanghai after the explanation.

Less Than One Hundred Bandits Landed

The authorities received the most reliable information yesterday that the bandits who landed this time were led by the bandit leader Ding Xishan himself. The bandit Ding is now using the pseudonym "Zaici." The deputy bandit leader, Tang Jingfeng, is from northern Jiangsu and is a veteran communist cadre. Under him is the Propaganda Section, whose "section chief" is a Mr. Hu, the "secretary" is a Mr. Wu, and the "staff officer" is Wang Yun, also known as Wang Zuyao (Ding Xishan's nephew), and Yang Zhichao. His troops consist of a special service platoon with thirteen soldiers, led by Tang Jingfeng, and two combat platoons, totaling more than 60 officers and soldiers, all from eastern Zhejiang, Pudong, or Punan. It is also reported that their weapons are very sophisticated, including five light machine guns, each with seven or eight hundred rounds of ammunition, ten Thompson submachine guns, each with more than two hundred rounds of ammunition, one carbine, one fast machine gun, three pistols, more than twenty 38-type and 79-type rifles, each with more than one hundred rounds of ammunition, three grenade launchers, and twelve hundred hand grenades. Their clothing is all gray cotton military uniforms (floral striped cloth lining with black iron buttons). The backpacks they carried were abandoned in the battle of Panjiajiao, and more than a thousand catties of grain were also abandoned. The group of remnant bandits now fleeing in Yushan and Tianma Mountain is led by Ding Xishan. The group hiding in Yanduntou is led by Tang Jingfeng. The former has more than 50 people, and the latter has less than 20 people. Their initial attempt was to land in Punan and hide in the villages of Punan to carry out their organizational work. If they cannot establish a foothold in Punan, they will flee to Taihu Lake via Qingpu, Luxu, and Wujiang.

Platoon Leader Rejects and Reports Deception

Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Zhan Xiufeng, a platoon leader from Songjiang who rejected the communist bandits who landed this time. He was the guard of Huang Chaozhi, the former magistrate of Songjiang County. According to him, in June last year, a friend named Wei said that he could introduce him to work on a cargo ship. At that time, Zhan was unemployed and went happily. On June 29 last year, Wei led him to a small port. There was indeed a wooden sailboat there. The wooden boat set sail from the Wusong Estuary the next day after boarding. As soon as it exited the estuary, a motor boat approached. More than a dozen people were transferred from the motor boat, all equipped with guns. One of them was called the boss. The wooden boat then sailed to Jinshanzui, and several more people boarded the boat. After the wooden boat was full, it sailed to Nantangkou, Dongtai County, northern Jiangsu, to land. After landing, they were trained in an unknown quiet village by the sea. The training was not very strict. They exercised for one hour a day and attended political classes for four hours. Life was extremely hard, eating two porridge and one meal a day and living in thatched sheds. On the 10th of this month, they were ordered to mix with veteran communist cadres and go to two sail boats to land. Then, the night before, he deserted when they crossed the blockade line and fled to Songjiang, where he surrendered to the commissioner's office.

### Police Department Holds Meeting; Security in the City's Suburbs is Safe

[Xinhua News Agency] Bao Lie, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, said in a speech yesterday that the security of the city's periphery is extremely solid. Although a small number of remnant bandits have recently harassed Songjiang County on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, most of them have been wiped out by the powerful troops of the National Army sent by the headquarters. The remaining bandits have now fled in all directions and are not a cause for concern.

In addition, it is learned that the Garrison Department held a garrison meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss ensuring the security of the city.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The rumor that there are remnant bandits wandering around Wusongkou has been refuted by the person in charge of the security brigade of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Department as unfounded.

### General Manager of New Sui Company, Zhu Bing, Arrested in the Capital; Planned Escape to Hong Kong, Reported by Northwest Minsheng Company

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] Zhu Bing, the general manager of the New Sui Company who was accused of fraud in a case at the Shanghai Local Court on November 8th of last year and was ordered to post bail but escaped, was arrested in the capital on the 17th. After escaping from Shanghai, Zhu secretly came to the capital and hid under an assumed name at No. 91 Xindu Apartment on Zhongshan East Road, trying in various ways to escape to Hong Kong again. This matter was learned by the Northwest Minsheng Company, which stated that the New Sui Company still owed a huge sum of 35 billion yuan and had not settled it. It then requested the public security authorities to transfer the entire case file from Shanghai and arrested Zhu at 3:00 PM on the 17th. Soon after Zhu was detained, Guang Lu, a legislator from Xinjiang, went to the Daxing Palace Police Station in the Eastern District to request Zhu's release on bail. The police station, considering that the Northwest Minsheng Company's accusation against Zhu was well-founded, did not approve the request. Therefore, the Eastern District Police Bureau transferred Zhu to the Beijing Local Court. Zhu confessed in court that the fifty trucks owed to the Northwest Minsheng Company could not be delivered because the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau had breached the contract. He was willing to donate to the state the portion of the 50 billion yuan that the National Government had previously returned from Sheng Shicai's extortion of the people of Xinjiang, as well as all his new properties. Xinjiang legislator Guang Lu and Hua Sheng, sympathetic to the two, went to the local court again to request Zhu's release on bail pending trial. However, the Northwest Minsheng Company expressed opposition, and the local court authorities also refused permission because Zhu had been accused of fraud involving 4 billion yuan in Shanghai for handling import and export business, which had not yet been settled, and he had once escaped. After a brief interrogation, he was handed over to the court's detention center to await investigation.

### Children Enthusiastically Donate New Year's Money to Help with Education

Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, a younger brother and a younger sister came to our office. They said their surname was Gu, and the two siblings were twelve and eleven years old this year. During the Lunar New Year these past few days, they received six million yuan in New Year's money from their relatives and friends. They originally wanted to buy some food and things to play with, but later felt that many poor children were pitiful because they couldn't afford to go to school! So, they sent this sum of money to our newspaper office to donate to the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" to help poor young people. Little Brother Gu and Little Sister Gu extended a helping hand to countless out-of-school children, which is worthy of great praise. We hope that all children will be inspired by this example, so that the practice of saving to help with education can spread widely.

Yesterday, dozens of students also came to the office requesting to complete application procedures retroactively. We are very sorry, but due to the limit on the number of places, we cannot provide them with assistance. Also, the Huaming Tobacco Company continues to solicit a large amount of donations for us on the "Air Bookstore" on China Cultural Radio. Here, we extend our greatest respect to Huaming Company, Cultural Radio, and the countless listeners who have helped us.

### Case of Police Officer Accusing Students Scheduled for Investigation on the 24th

[Our Dispatch] Tongji University students Feng Li Wen and Fan Zheng Sheng were previously accused of assault and obstructing official duties by Cai Yan Zuo, a staff member of the North Sichuan Road Police Branch Bureau. Prosecutor Chen Shou Tao is handling the case and has scheduled a court hearing for the 24th of this month. Because Feng and Fan are suspected of being involved in the student unrest and insulting Mayor Wu, they are currently being detained in the police bureau and will be brought in for questioning at that time.

[Our Dispatch] The Civil Aviation Administration believes that the current aviation communication radio stations, in addition to those set up by the bureau in various places, are also set up independently by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC). This not only makes it impossible to unify command, but is also almost a waste. Therefore, there has recently been a proposal to organize a joint aviation wireless communication company to merge the three parties' radio stations into a commercial company managed by the Civil Aviation Administration. The company will uniformly supply aviation telecommunications and charge fixed fees to various airlines. This would concentrate human and material resources, reduce the Civil Aviation Administration's financial burden, and improve the treatment of staff. The specific measures have now been drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval.

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Office of the Civil Aviation Administration recently issued a public notice in the newspapers to claim four ownerless aircraft parked at Longhua Airport. It is now learned that Cao Shi Ang, the former head of the flight crew of the Da Hua Aviation Company, has come forward to claim them. However, the Civil Aviation Administration requires additional documentary proof and completion of procedures because Da Hua Aviation Company has not been formally established. Da Hua Company failed to start operations last year due to certain reasons, and the four aircraft have been abandoned at Longhua Airport for more than a year. Although the exterior is still intact, it is reported that the internal machinery has been rusted and cannot be flown without major repairs.

Prosecutor Ding Chuan En is handling the case and has scheduled to go to CNAC and CATC today to investigate in person. He will summon those involved in the case for questioning in the coming days.

### Fifth Session of the Municipal Council Focuses on Three Major Issues; Secretariat Receives Six Proposals

The opening ceremony of the Fifth Session of the First Municipal Council is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 23rd of this month. The Secretariat of the Council has been busy with various preparations in recent days. It is reported that this session will focus on discussing the housing rental problem, the tuition fee standard problem, and the problem of conserving electricity. These issues are currently being carefully studied by the relevant subcommittees, and no specific opinions have been put forward yet.

### Frequent Power Outages in Nanshi; Councilors Request Improvement

[Our Dispatch] Municipal Councilors Zhao Yang Xiong and Li Kai Di, et al., at the request of the representatives of the Nanshi District, stated that the Shanghai Chinese Electricity Company often does not follow the regulations for power outages in the Nanshi District, either several nights a week or with irregular shutdowns, leaving users unprepared and extremely inconvenienced. In addition, the district is located in a remote area, and frequent power outages during this severe winter can easily lead to bandit activity. Therefore, they have jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Electricity Company requesting attention to finding ways to improve the situation and requesting strengthened power supply.

### Masterminds of the Destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau Under Strict Police Interrogation

Lawyer Cheng Meng Ming Provides Pro Bono Defense

[Our Dispatch] Hu Diya, the chief editor of the China United News Agency who was falsely accused of theft and attempted suicide by taking poison in court the other day, has gradually recovered after being sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment and escaping danger. Lawyer Cheng Meng Ming yesterday wrote a statement for him pro bono and submitted it to the local procuratorate as a defense. In addition to stating the detailed circumstances of the false accusation, he requested that he be not prosecuted according to the law. Hu Diya expressed his hope to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible so that he can appeal to all parties to redress his wrongful accusation. He expressed his gratitude for the sympathy shown by his colleagues in recent days. However, because he has no relatives or friends in Shanghai, he hopes that all parties can provide further assistance with his medical expenses, post-discharge residence, and financial matters.

### Three Prisoners Deny Revealing Inside Story of Prison; Warden Kong Expresses Discouragement; Claims the Accusations are False

[Our Dispatch] Yang Guan Shou, Shi Rui Qing, Zhang Yi Xin, and other prisoners detained in Shanghai Prison secretly reported the abuse of prisoners by prison guards. In response, reporters visited Zha Liang Jian, the president of the local court, yesterday. President Zha said, "The court often receives such secret reports, but it is not appropriate to publish them lightly without corroborating evidence. In this case, many of the points in the prisoners' secret report about the prison differ greatly from the facts. It is deeply regrettable that the Central News Agency has publicly published them." Reporters then drove to Shanghai Prison for a visit. Warden Kong Xiang Lin expressed discouragement over this, saying that the allegations in the secret report were not true. He welcomed reporters to enter and visit. The so-called "Wind Wave Pavilion" (i.e., the Harmony Prison) was originally equipped during the old Public Works Department era. Small windows were opened on the roof, which were specially designed for patients with lung disease or bronchitis, that is, for isolation wards. The last time there was a prison riot, some of the troublemakers were transferred to the "Harmony Prison" for isolation. After the situation subsided, they were still returned to their original place of detention.

No One in Harmony Prison; Reporters Visited "Harmony Prison" Yesterday and Found No One Inside. Warden Kong continued to tell reporters that Yang Guan Shou, Shi Rui Qing, and Zhang Yi Xin were all involved in robbery cases and were sentenced by the Garrison Command Military Law Department. Yang was sentenced to eight years, Shi to twelve years, and Zhang to ten years. They often caused trouble in the prison on weekdays. They had a prison riot once last January, and the local court added seven months to their sentences for obstructing official duties.

Interview with Three Prisoners; Afterwards, Warden Kong, in a very frank manner, brought out Yang Guan Shou, No. 3038, Shi Rui Qing, No. 3041, and Zhang Yi Xin, No. 3036, from the prison to have a free conversation with reporters. No one was monitoring them. Shi said: "I have no complaints about the prison. I don't know who wrote the secret report." Yang said: "Half a month ago, I talked with fellow prisoners about being dissatisfied with the facilities of the prison authorities, but I did not write a secret report." Zhang also said that he did not know. While reporters were talking with the prisoners, prisoner No. 911 violated the rules and even punched guard Ma Jing Duan in the face, swelling it. The guards cried to reporters, saying that these criminals were extremely fierce and difficult to manage.

Known for Causing Trouble; Reporters also visited Huang Liang, the chief prosecutor of the local procuratorate, yesterday to inquire whether personnel would be sent to investigate the prisoners' secret report about the prison. Chief Huang said: "According to investigations, these three prisoners are all military criminals who are known for causing trouble in prison. We previously asked the Garrison Command to transfer the three prisoners to the Army Prison, but it was unsuccessful. As for the allegations in the secret report that the guards were retained from the enemy and puppet period, it is found that there are many employees below the level of officials in various agencies who were retained from the enemy and puppet period. It is impossible to dismiss them all one by one. This is not unique to Shanghai Prison. With these two premises, many of the allegations are not entirely true. The local procuratorate does not place excessive importance on this secret report."

In addition, the Shanghai Prison authorities sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency on the 17th, responding to the six points revealed in the prisoners' secret report to the Municipal Council, and stated that the prison is closely watched by both Chinese and foreign observers. All matters must be handled in accordance with the law. The prisoners Yang Kai Shou, et al., are not used to this kind of restraint, so they falsely accuse and confuse the hearing, which affects the reputation of the prison, and it is even more significant if it is transmitted internationally and reprinted.

### Lu Wu, Director of the Central Meteorological Observatory, Takes Office; Talks About Reasons Why Meteorological Reports Are Difficult to Be Accurate

[Our Dispatch] Zheng Zi Zheng, director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, has resigned, and Lu Wu (see picture), director of the Nanjing Central Meteorological Observatory, has been appointed by the Central Meteorological Bureau to succeed him. He formally took office yesterday. Lu had been researching meteorology at the Academia Sinica for many years and had served as a professor at Zhejiang University. He went to the United States last August to attend the International Meteorological Conference and has just recently returned to the country.

He said that the meteorological reporting work in our region is far behind the United States due to financial constraints. The United States has 750 meteorological stations nationwide, while our country currently has only 118. In addition, due to the lack of telecommunications equipment, only about 80 stations can regularly report. The United States has 150 stations nationwide that measure weather balloons, while our country currently has only 38, of which only about one-quarter regularly report. The accuracy of meteorological reporting depends entirely on the number of stations and the speed of information transmission. Therefore, with our country's current material resources, it is impossible to achieve 100% accurate weather forecasts. The Central Meteorological Bureau is now paying special attention to the meteorological reporting work in Shanghai and is determined to start by strengthening technology and strive for accuracy to ensure the safety of air and sea transportation.

### Hai Kang Ship Regularly Sails to Japan; Our Military Police Accompany the Ship Abroad

### Fare Increases for Passenger and Freight Transport by Shipping Companies to Be Decided Within the Next Two Days

After the Lunar New Year, prices continue to rise, especially for fuels such as coal, gasoline, and diesel, which have increased the most. Shipping companies in the city increased passenger and freight rates by 50% on January 15th. Now, only one month later, they feel that they are not covering costs, so they intend to increase them again by 39% based on the proportion of various expenses. The Shipping Association also sent Hu Shi Yuan, Zhong Shan Dao, Cheng Yu Zhai, and Li Yun Liang to Beijing a few days ago to request approval from the Ministry of Communications. It is now learned that, except for Li Yun Liang, who is still staying in Beijing to await the Ministry's approval, Hu Shi Yuan and others have returned to Shanghai. The adjustment of freight rates may be decided within the next two days.

### Establishment of Port Authority Approved for Trial Implementation; Zhao Zeng Jue to Report on the Process Today

U Mitton's attitude was good, but this issue will be discussed further with the Burmese government after Tu takes office. At present, there are still 5,000 to 7,000 overseas Chinese in Guangdong and Fujian provinces who urgently need to return and resettle.

### Fire in Western Shanghai; One Child Dies

### Hanyeping Corporation Begins Asset Liquidation

The long-established Hanyeping Coal and Iron Mining Company lost its rights and interests and was on the verge of bankruptcy before the war because it repeatedly borrowed huge amounts of Japanese debt without authorization, mortgaging all of its factory and mining assets and the underground reserves of the Daye Iron Mine to Japan. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was exploited by the enemy. After the victory, in order to rebuild the steel industry in Central China, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Resources Commission to form the Hanyeping Corporation Asset Liquidation Committee to liquidate the company's assets and Japanese debts. It is reported that the company's Shanghai headquarters was taken over on the 16th by personnel sent by the Committee, who are now beginning to handle the inventory.

### Tax Official Flees After Committing Crimes; High School Principal Liable for Guarantee

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau's case of auditor Gao Shi Jie, et al., extorting money from various Chinese-style wood furniture businesses was sentenced by the Criminal Division of the local court on December 12th of last year. However, another employee of the Direct Tax Bureau, Feng He Qian, was also involved in the case, but the local procuratorate did not send Feng He Qian's criminal information to the Criminal Division of the local court. The president of the court previously sent a letter to the local procuratorate requesting that Feng He Qian's case be reinvestigated. The local procuratorate then sent bailiffs to Feng's residence at No. 15, Lane 69, Ganshi East Road to arrest him. Unexpectedly, Feng had already fled. Subsequently, Xu Ze Zou, the principal of Ronghai Middle School, Feng's guarantor, was held accountable. The local procuratorate summoned Xu once on the 4th of this month and gave him ten days to hand over Feng. Yesterday, Xu was summoned again, and because he still could not hand over Feng, he was given another ten days and ordered to provide a shop guarantee.

### Committing Crimes in Shanghai and Fleeing to Other Cities; Two Thieves Arrested in Wuxi and Nanhui

Last winter, he formed a gang of four people and robbed goods, generators, and other items from a cigarette paper store in Yanjiacun, Zhabei. On December 24th, he also robbed a pedestrian of 1.8 million yuan in legal tender on Baoshan Road.

### European Diary (1)

— Li Hanhun

I set out with the delegation, with two objectives: one, to seek a good doctor to operate on an ear ailment that has hindered my hearing for thirty years; and two, to study the postwar reconstruction of various European and American countries. Just after the New Year of the Republic of China, the 36th year, when the winter plum blossoms had just begun to open and the waves of Nanpu were clear, I took the "General Gordon" ship and crossed the Pacific Ocean from Shenjiang, stepping onto the New Continent. After settling various matters, I was able to proceed with the primary purpose of this trip, the treatment of my ear ailment. The doctor used the latest surgical procedure, drilling a small hole in my left ear directly to the auditory nerve. When the central nervous system failed, heaven and earth were dark, and the universe seemed to turn upside down. After five months, although my hearing had recovered, my head was still slightly dizzy. The doctor was away on summer vacation and instructed me to travel in a timely manner to relax and broaden my mind. Therefore, taking advantage of my wife Ju Fang's summer vacation at Columbia University, I invited her to serve as my interpreter and made a European tour together. We visited thirteen countries, including England, Norway, Sweden (Denmark), the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Morocco, France, Germany, and Switzerland. Observing the historical relics, social phenomena, and postwar measures of these countries, there are many things that we can learn from. Thanks to the extensive assistance of embassies and consulates in various places, friendly people, and fellow overseas Chinese, and with careful budgeting, I was able to conduct a more in-depth exploration in the most economical time. I am deeply grateful for their kindness and hospitality. After returning to New York, I had some free time, so I drafted "A European Diary," seeking correction from the world, in order to report one gain from my special guidance and inspection, and to express my heartfelt gratitude. The doctor said that the ear ailment still needs further treatment. Once my hearing is completely clear, I will complete a tour of the United States. If time permits, I will write a "Diary of the American Continent" to seek correction from experts. (Li Hanhun in New York, December 25, 1947)

Queen Mary

It was August, the scorching sun was shining brightly. At 3 p.m., I stepped onto the "Queen Mary," docked at Pier 90 in New York. With relatives and friends seeing us off, and songs of farewell being sung frequently, a feeling of parting was evoked. At 4 p.m., the ship set sail, leaving the bustling city of densely populated skyscrapers and entering the vast ocean where the sky and water meet. The sea was vast and boundless, and the clear breeze filled my heart. Having spent half a year in a noisy environment recovering from illness, I felt as if I had entered a fairyland. Ju Fang and I unbuttoned our collars, let our hair down, and stood at the bow of the ship, refreshing our minds for a long time. At that moment, I felt a sense of floating and wanting to become immortal.

Among the Chinese on board were Professor Zeng Zhaolun and Gan Guangyi and his mother. Zhaolun is a famous chemistry expert who came to the United States before me. He is now going to England to lecture at the invitation of a British cultural organization. Thousands of miles away, we were on the same boat, reminiscing about the past and discussing new ideas, which dispelled a lot of loneliness during the journey. The "Queen Mary" is the fastest ship in the world, and this was only the second time it sailed from the United States to England after the war. It has a tonnage of 82,500 tons, second only to its sister ship "Queen Elizabeth," and employs more than 900 workers. The passenger seats are divided into three classes, with 700 seats each for first and second class, and 800 seats for third class. The first-class fare from New York to England is 495 US dollars, with adjustments depending on the location and facilities. A single room costs 743 US dollars. Second class starts from 250 dollars, and third class starts from 160 dollars. The ship has ten decks, namely 1. Sun Deck, 2. Promenade Deck, 3. Main Deck, 4. A Deck, 5. B Deck, 6. R Deck, 7. C Deck, 8. D Deck, 9. E Deck, 10. F. Deck. The observation deck and the bottom cabin are not included. There are twelve elevators. In addition to the general facilities such as a large restaurant, smoking room, bar, lounge, and washroom, there are also a library, writing room, photography room, badminton court, billiard room, ping-pong table, movie theater, grocery store, post office, telegraph office, customs office, immigration office, hospital, swimming pool, sunbathing area, children's playground, and dog kennel. The scale is magnificent, and everything is available. Passengers boarding this ocean skyscraper feel like they have entered a metropolis, giving them a sense of being at home.

Time on the ship passes easily. From morning to night, regular meals and tea are spaced out at intervals. Games and entertainment are arranged according to individual preferences, making people completely forget the loneliness of the journey.

The first-class cabins are equipped like first-class hotels in New York, with exquisite furniture and bedding. Although the rooms are smaller than those in a typical hotel, they are delicate and charming, making them worth cherishing. The first-class restaurant can accommodate more than 300 people, with 150 waiters, one servant for every two guests, fully demonstrating the aristocratic style of England. At dinner, many people wear formal attire, with tailcoats waving, displaying a refined demeanor. Women wear long gowns with bare chests, also in the style of British aristocratic women. Although the facilities in the second and third class rooms and restaurants are less luxurious, they are very clean.

The Immigration Bureau handles entry procedures on the ship, which is much more convenient than standing and waiting on the dock in San Francisco. Americans like to learn from the strengths of the British, but the American Immigration Bureau cannot emulate the British in this regard and often causes many troubles for foreigners arriving in the United States, especially Chinese, upon arrival.

The journey was smooth and calm, reminding me of the comfort I felt when crossing the Pacific Ocean. In fact, this trip was also due to the ship's great power and strength, which was enough to calm the winds and waves. Spending five days and nights on the ship, I not only did not feel any discomfort, but also felt that the ship was traveling too fast. Meditating in the quiet room, I thought that I might not have another opportunity to ride this world's most magnificent ship, leisurely enjoying the ocean and appreciating the prosperity and happiness at sea. The world economy is so depressed after the war, and England is also very difficult, but the Queen Mary can still maintain its former grandeur, which shows that there are many contradictions in the world, and the British dominance at sea before the war, their attitude, and their commercial skills can be seen from this. At 10 p.m. on the fifth day, the ship arrived at the southern dock of England (Southampton). Looking at the banks of the Thames River in the distance, the lights were reflected, and the city shadows were blurred, breaking the quiet atmosphere of the sea and revealing the tense emotions of passengers arriving at their destination.

Stepping into England

Leaving the "Queen Mary" and stepping onto English soil, I met with staff from the Embassy and learned that train and hotel accommodations had been arranged. Soon the train departed, and I saw farmhouses on both sides, the scenery vaguely familiar. Entering the city area, broken walls and ruins, the traces of war, could still be discerned. The train arrived at Waterloo Station in London, and I stayed at the Mount Royal Hotel. After settling in, I spread out a map and discussed a two-week tour plan with Ju Fang.

I visited Ambassador Zheng Futing at the Embassy, reminiscing about our separation and discussing the general situation at home and abroad. The current situation and recent measures of British society were the main topics of conversation. Both lunch and dinner were at the Embassy. After the meal, we went out for sightseeing, accompanied by staff from the Embassy during the day and by Ambassador Zheng himself in the evening. On the first day, we took a whirlwind tour of the city area, and then revisited the important places. The host's kindness was very touching.

At the Embassy, I visited the memorial room for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's imprisonment. On the walls were portraits of Mr. Sun, the late Chairman Lin, and Kantley. There were also Hu Zhantang's poem and Guo Taiqi's description of the events. The bed, chairs, and utensils in the room were all original. Recalling that the Minister at the time was Zhao Zhaoyuan, the one who lured the Premier was Deng Tingjian, and the ones who reported to Kantley were the English couple, the Kirls, the evil of the treacherous officials surfaced in my mind. The twelve days of imprisonment are an indelible memorial to the Chinese Revolution. Lingering, I could not bear to leave, as if I saw the spirit of the Premier still showing us the great spirit of revolutionaries overcoming dangers and ultimately winning.

Looking up at the Nelson Monument towering in the sky, I seemed to see the great achievements of Nelson defeating Napoleon. Next, I saw the Egyptian obelisk, which seemed to symbolize that ancient Eastern culture had long been transplanted to the British Isles. Then, I saw Buckingham Palace, which was mixed in with the streets and had no special features, and the Victoria Memorial in front of the palace. Is the reason why the British monarchy has been able to maintain its power due to its proximity to the masses? Then, I went to Westminster Abbey. The church is a large building with a grand scale. Many queens, celebrities, and nobles of past dynasties are buried here. The great literary giant Shakespeare also stands prominently as a statue. Is it because the British are proud of this in the world literary world? There is a room inside that requires a ticket to enter, where the coffin statue of the British King is located. The treasures of the dynasties are old and worn out, is it because they deliberately show that they are an old family? I went to St. Paul's Cathedral. The dome of the sky is round, and I was dizzy when I looked up. Many celebrities of past dynasties are buried or have statues here. There is a room underground with even more statues. Wellington is particularly lifelike. The right side of the room was bombed by German planes during the recent war and is currently being repaired with fundraising.

Visiting the British Museum, it is magnificent and beautiful beyond description. Upon going upstairs, I saw many Chinese antiquities on display, including three large bronze bells, two stone beasts, several murals and Buddha statues, bronze tripods, cloisonné tripods, bronze incense tables, and many other types of medieval earth objects. How did they end up here? It was jarring and heartbreaking, unbearable to look at. In addition, there are also antiquities from Greece, Rome, and the Near East. Because of the short time and the intense emotional impact, I did not look at them in detail and left immediately.

At the Wax Museum, the statues are very lifelike, and it is difficult to distinguish between the real and the fake. The rooms on the second floor are mostly divided by category. There are statues of British queens, famous prime ministers, and famous generals of past dynasties. Napoleon, Washington, Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, and others each have a dedicated room. On the third floor, there are many stories and a statue of Hitler. Finally, in the basement, there are displays of ancient tortures and crimes, which are chilling.

Hyde Park is a cool oasis in the bustling city and a hotbed of political debate. Because it is near my residence, I often visit it. I often see speakers standing on small wooden boxes, speaking passionately (interspersed with applause or exclamations from the audience). Whether it is national policy or the grievances of the neighborhood, they speak freely and even debate fiercely. And they are not subject to any interference. Not only do they maintain a gentlemanly demeanor, but they also demonstrate a democratic style, which is worthy of emulation.

I hastily glimpsed a corner of London, full of ancient charm. Because there is a lot of business during the day, the streets are mostly deserted by 10 p.m. Coming here from New York, I can't help but feel a little lonely. England has a long history among the Western powers, but from the perspective of a traveler from an ancient Eastern country, it does not evoke a strong feeling of nostalgia. From an American perspective, it seems old and outdated.

Inspecting the East End

Introduced by the Embassy, a certain city councilor guided me by car to the East London area, which was the most heavily bombed during the recent war. The weather was particularly gloomy that day. As we traveled east, the suffering gradually increased. London has a division between rich and poor areas. The East End is poor and the West End is rich. German planes visited the East End particularly often. The bombing targets of the German army were mainly to destroy transportation. The East End is close to the docks and the transportation center of Kunlin, so the poor people suffered the most. London is divided into 28 districts, and the East End has a population of about 300,000. During the war, about 80,000 people were killed in London, and nearly one-third of the victims were in this area. The ashes have not yet been extinguished, reminding me of the scene of rescuing disaster victims after enemy planes bombed Guangzhou when I was in Guangdong. But they have already "prospered," what will become of us! First, I saw the Elizabethan wooden house from the 16th century; then, I saw the streets where the nobles lived in the 18th century. The London City in Greater London includes an area of one square mile in the greater city. Because the greater city was developed from this small city, it is preserved as a memorial. The mayor has a very high status in this area. The Prime Minister must give way when meeting him. The British King must obtain his permission to enter the city. When entering this area for the first time, I saw the old mayor's residence standing at the street corner, facing the National Bank. The small city has a gate, which is used for entry and exit. Now it is abandoned and unused, but the remnants still exist.

Visiting the Tower of London, which began construction in 1066, although it has lost its original function, it stands on the banks of the Thames River. Not only are the walls still intact, but there are also many ancient weapons inside, as well as crowns from past dynasties. The majestic sword aura makes people think of the complementary relationship between emperors and warriors. Seeing the naval memorial iron tablet for the First World War, I was reminded of the majestic appearance of the British navy at the time. The East London Avenue is wide and paved with bricks, reminding people of the traces of the Roman occupation more than 50 years before Christ. The landscape remains the same, but the people have changed. History is merciless, who can forget this?

The scale and spirit of the British are indeed considerable. At a time when the economy is extremely difficult, there is a whole plan on the ruins of the East End to build dozens of low-income housing units ranging from two to seven stories. The method is that all bombed houses that cannot be rebuilt by the residents themselves and are suitable for public use are purchased by the government. The costs of purchase and construction are borne by local taxes and national subsidies. These new houses are given priority to newlyweds, the sick, and families of veterans. I visited several households and saw that the living room, bathroom, and gas heating were all well-equipped. Then I visited the district nursery, which specializes in accepting children from one month to five years old. The daily fee is one shilling, and the government subsidizes one and a half pounds per week. The distribution of milk to adults in London is minimal, but it is very sufficient for children. In addition, the facility is well-equipped, and the management is thorough. The children are all very fat and happy. Because Ju Fang was entrusted by the Ministry of Social Affairs to investigate children's welfare undertakings, she paid special attention to this.

Visiting Chinatown, I heard that there are more than 2,000 overseas Chinese in London, most of whom used to live here; most of them are poisoners. Although it has been severely destroyed after the bombing, the overseas Chinese still greeted us with bitter smiles. The Seamen's Union and the Righteous Industrial and Commercial Association are located here. Mr. Gu Genfu, the person in charge of the association, said that the current Seamen's Union has more than 1,000 people, who come and go from time to time. Their wages, excluding food and accommodation, range from 12 to 18 pounds per month. Their work mainly involves stoking fires, cleaning, and serving as waiters and sailors. Life is quite difficult. During the recent war, ships from various countries were forced to gather here, and about 30,000 overseas Chinese sacrificed their lives while serving, which is also a significant number.

The slums of the East London area have attracted the attention of people all over the world. A hundred years ago, professors from Oxford and Cambridge universities lived in this area for a long time, investigating the lives of the poor and seeking ways to improve them. Marx's theory of the proletarian revolution was mostly based on this. The rise of the British Fabian Society also originated here. Both belong to socialism. The difference is that Marx believes that the transition from capitalism to communism must take the path of violent revolution and must go through the stage of the dictatorship of the proletariat; the Fabian Society believes that the transition from capitalism to socialism can be achieved through rational persuasion and can be achieved through the representative system without bloodshed. The latter is the source of today's British Labor Party's theoretical foundation. After the tour, the tragic bombing of the East London area and the historical facts of social evolution filled my mind and swirled around, preventing me from sleeping all night. I got up and read the third lecture of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Dawn broke in the east, and I finally fell asleep.

### Datong Steamboat Capsizes at Jiaohe Fortunately No One Was Injured

[Our newspaper, Haiyan, 16th] The Datong steamboat from Jiaoli Weir to Xiaoshi in this county capsized in Jiaohe the day before yesterday afternoon. Because 70 or 80 passengers from Ganpu were transferring to Shanghai, but the Datong steamboat was too small to accommodate so many passengers, they managed to borrow a small boat to attach to the side. However, because the attached boat was even smaller than the original steamboat and carried a lot of people, at about 2 p.m., when the steamboat arrived at Kuabu Bridge (close to Xia), a ticket seller jumped from the steamboat to the towboat at the back to sell tickets. The towboat suddenly capsized, and all the passengers fell into the water. After making every effort to rescue them, all of them came ashore after more than ten minutes. Fortunately, no one was injured.

### Americans Are Very Interested in the Taiwan Issue

[Our newspaper, Taipei, 11th] According to Mr. Xia Zhihua, who recently returned to the nest from the United States: Americans are very interested in the Taiwan issue and express deep concern. During the war, Princeton University established the Taiwan Research Institute under the Navy, with up to 2,000 students. At that time, a detailed plan was drafted for the Allied forces to take over after landing. After the victory, Taiwan was incorporated into China, and this plan could not be realized. Currently, universities in the United States that have applied to establish research institutions on Taiwan include the University of Washington in Seattle, which has a Far Eastern Department. The head of the department is an expert in Eastern problems in Europe. Kerr (G. Kerr.), who was the American Vice Consul in Taiwan, is also a short-term professor. He mainly teaches Japanese history and Taiwanese history. Because he spent a long time in Taiwan and personally experienced the 228 Incident, he provides a lot of information about Taiwan. However, it is regrettable that his published topics on Taiwan seem to be biased and fail to objectively report the facts. He even insulted mainland personnel coming to Taiwan. Mr. Xia attended a symposium convened by Kerr in a private capacity. Most of the questions he raised were disagreed with, and Mr. Xia answered truthfully. Another institution studying Taiwan is the Chinese Gang Library at Harvard University, which is divided into Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chinese border research. The research on Tibet and Xinjiang border provinces is very detailed. The research on Taiwan focuses on the language and racial origin of the Gaoshan people. A pure academic study is conducted on the 88,748 people scattered in the deep mountains using ethnology and anthropology. They also plan to send experts to Taiwan for field investigations, hoping to work with famous scholars in this province to conduct joint research and exploration. Professor Li, who used to teach at Qinghua University, also participated in the research at the university. These two universities have special lectures on Taiwan, which fully shows the concern of the Allied nations for Taiwan.

### Qingdao Port: Construction Project Underway

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 17th] Since the Ministry of Transportation established an engineering bureau in Qingdao last year, it has been vigorously carrying out the construction of the Sixth Pier. Repairing the fender timbers and other projects on various piers in the port have also been completed successively. The Fifth Pier, which collapsed the year before last, is using a steel sheet pile plan, which has been actively planned for a year. Currently, the steel sheet piles have been ordered from the Bethlehem Steel Plant in the United States and have been successively shipped directly from New York to Qingdao. Each steel sheet pile is six point four meters long and weighs two and a half tons, totaling approximately three thousand tons. Other necessary materials have also been prepared one after another. At the end of last month, famous Shanghai-Nanjing construction company representatives, whose qualifications had been reviewed and approved, flew to Qingdao for on-site surveying and estimation. Bidding was opened at the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing on the 9th of this month, presided over by Counselor Jin Shi-xuan. Bureau Chief Song Xi-shang, Chief of the Public Works Section Gao Zong-yi, and Engineer Zhang Bao-tian also went to Nanjing to assist. The winning bidder was the China United Engineering Company. The contract will be signed within days, and the entire project is expected to be completed within eight months. The construction methods for this project largely utilize new machinery, making it arguably the most significant and challenging construction project in the country this year.

### Taiwan Province's Adopted Daughter System Urgently Needs Attention and Improvement

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 10th] The "adopted daughter system" ("sim-pu-á" in the Taiwanese language), which has persisted in Taiwanese society for decades, was not banned during the Japanese rule and has become even more prevalent since the retrocession. These adopted daughters only have two paths: one is to be forced into prostitution, selling their bodies, and the other is to work as domestic servants. Those familiar with the situation say that during the Japanese era, the market price for an adopted daughter was three hundred yuan, with the highest price being ten yuan. Currently, the market price for a beautiful young girl aged fifteen to eighteen is generally 60,000 legal tender, with the highest price being 80,000 legal tender (equivalent to 8.16 million of this currency). In these human transactions, both parties hold contracts. Those sold into prostitution stipulate "the seller is not responsible for what happens afterward." Those sold as domestic servants stipulate "the buyer is responsible for taking care of the girl until she grows up and gets married." Recently, many disputes have arisen from this unreasonable adopted daughter system. It is generally believed that the "disease" of "existent in all provinces, but uniquely abundant in Taiwan Province" urgently requires attention and improvement from the women's community.

### Schools Overcharging Fees Education Bureau to Order Refunds

Yunchong Girls' School Tuition Fees

Parents Call for Reduction

[Our Newspaper] A group of parents of students at Yunchong Girls' School in this city held a press conference at the Meilongzhen Restaurant yesterday afternoon to report the situation. According to reports, "Students at the school received fee payment notices from the school a few days ago, requiring payment between the 17th and 20th. Junior high school tuition and fees are 4.6 million legal tender, and senior high school tuition and fees are 5.8 million legal tender, which is much higher than the municipal government's regulations of 3.2 million for junior high school and 4 million for senior high school. Students' parents are unable to afford this, so they have formed a parents' association and are calling for four points: (1) Request Mayor Wu to reduce tuition fees and order all schools to strictly enforce them. (2) Before the above request is fulfilled, Yunchong students will pay 4 million legal tender first. (3) All Yunchong parents will postpone paying fees. (4) Increase teachers' salaries and provide them with in-kind benefits."

### Li Ximou Hosts Public Banquet Today Catholic Education Conference Representatives Li Daonan Discusses the Future of Catholic Education

[Our Newspaper] Director Li Ximou of the Municipal Education Bureau is scheduled to host a public banquet at the International Hotel at noon today for the representatives attending the National Catholic Education Conference. Secretary-General Shen of the Municipal Government will attend on behalf of Mayor Wu at that time.

[Our Newspaper] Tuesday was the third day of the National Catholic Education Conference, which was still held in the auditorium of Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences on Changle Road in Shanghai. In the morning, Li Daonan, Principal of Shangzhi Middle School in Hankou, spoke on "The Economics of Catholic Schools," and Xi Pinmei of the Shanghai Diocese Education Committee spoke on "The Conditions that Faculty and Staff Should Have in Teaching, Morality, and Religion." In the afternoon, Zhang Boda, Principal of Xuhui Middle School, spoke on "Social Education in Boys' Schools," and Zhou Weicheng, Principal of Qiming Girls' School, spoke on "Social Education in Girls' Schools," all with insightful remarks.

Public Meeting Tomorrow The general meeting on Wednesday will feature a speech by Ying Qianli, Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education, on "The Contribution of Catholic Education to Social Education." The public meeting will begin on Thursday afternoon.

"Another dispatch" Li Daonan, Principal of Shangzhi Middle School in Hankou, made the following remarks to reporters regarding the future of Catholic education: The Catholic Church aims to civilize all people. Among the strategies for civilizing all people, the most appropriate and practical in China's current situation is to establish schools. Every school is the best stronghold. Through this stronghold, there are opportunities to proclaim doctrine and civilize humanity anytime, anywhere. However, the degree to which the function of civilization is exerted depends on the quality of school education. In order to reap high effects on the mission of civilizing humanity, Catholic education must not only increase the quantitative aspects, but especially require more numbers. According to the 1947 Chinese Missionary Area Yearbook published in Shanghai: There are a total of 2,298 Catholic primary schools, 340 senior primary schools, 128 junior and senior high schools, and 3 universities. This statistic, in proportion to the number of four million believers in China's 140 dioceses, shows that Catholic schools are indeed too few in quantity. What's more, the target of Catholic education is not only the children of a few believers, but must reach the youth and children outside the Church, so the quantity must be increased.

Restore the Foundation System At present, the maintenance of Catholic schools is 100% dependent on tuition income. Under the threat of inflation and rising prices, it is a major question whether tuition income alone can continue to sustain them. Therefore, in order to consolidate the survival of the schools, another method must be established. According to my personal opinion, the best method is to restore the foundation system. However, even with the foundation system, it must be used well. The best way to use it is for each secondary school to have an affiliated hospital, using its profits to support the secondary school's expenses. Not only does the secondary school receive economic support, but the hospital itself is also a missionary stronghold, which can have a dual meaning for the civilization of all people. In addition, the Catholic Church Affairs Promotion Committee should also raise large sums of money to subsidize primary and secondary schools with good performance in various regions, and to help dioceses lacking schools or without schools to establish primary and secondary schools.

Distribute the Teaching Network After the economic problem has a solution, a Catholic school teaching network should be established. The distribution of the teaching network should at least establish an official primary school in each parish or large congregation, at least establish an official senior primary school in each deanery, at least establish official junior secondary schools for both boys and girls in each diocese, and at least establish official senior secondary schools for both boys and girls in each ecclesiastical province. In addition, universities should be established in Central China, Western China, Southern China, and Northeast China. If Catholic education economics are fully grasped, and if a Catholic education network can be established, I think that the effect of the Catholic mission in China for more than 300 years will be easily made more significant and developed immediately.

### Legal Does Not Permit Test Cadaver Dissection China Anatomical Society Petitions Central Government for Remedy

[Our Newspaper] The China Anatomical Society, which was established not long ago, finds that due to the nation's adherence to customs, people are unwilling to allow corpses to be used for dissection after death, and this is also not permitted by law. As a result, there is a severe shortage of corpses for experimental dissection needed for medical education in our country. Universities and research institutes are all suffering from a lack of resources to meet urgent practical needs. The Society will submit a formal document to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to seek remedies as soon as possible and will suggest drafting measures to the Legislative Yuan for legislation. Professor Lu Yudao, the person in charge of the Society, stated: The test cadaver dissections in medical colleges are of great importance to medical education. As far as he knows, the authorities of medical colleges and universities today are all anxious about this problem. Before the war, the test cadaver dissections used by Peking Union Medical College were borrowed from Jinling University in Nanjing. After the war, Jinling University also felt a shortage. Recently, most schools have borrowed them from the National Defense Medical College, but the number is very small and insufficient. Mr. Lu believes that this is due to the fact that our country has not legislated, so even ownerless abandoned corpses cannot be used for experimental dissection. However, the general custom in our country is that individuals and their families do not want their bodies to be dissected after death, which is the biggest reason. Mr. Lu said: Experimental dissection is divided into two types, physiological and pathological. Westerners who die from illness often leave instructions to their families to ask doctors to dissect the body in order to understand the pathology. The spirit of contributing one's dead body to medical education and benefiting society and future generations is worthy of emulation in our country and should be vigorously promoted.

### Skyrocketing Prices Halt Trading: Rice Market in Chaos, Mayor Wu Cables Central Government for Emergency Measures

[Our Report] The rice market was in a chaotic state yesterday due to rising rice prices in the producing areas. Formal trading did not open at the exchange. Off-exchange bids exceeded the 2 million mark. The Bureau of Social Affairs released 5,000 dan each in the North and South markets at a price of 1.75 million. Mayor Wu urgently cabled Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food, requesting immediate emergency measures and ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Wuxi County Government to quickly suppress rice prices in the producing areas.

It is reported that the price of rice in Wuxi production area had reached 1.96 million the afternoon before yesterday. The reason for such a rise is that Xu Zhou merchants were buying in large quantities there. The purchase quantity is calculated by train, each car can hold about 15 tons of rice, and there are a total of ten cars. Mayor Wu contacted County Chief Xu of Wuxi by long-distance telephone yesterday, asking to suppress local prices. County Chief Xu immediately took charge of the local rice market and stopped the ten cars of rice being purchased, limiting the price of rice in Wuxi to 1.65 million yuan. It is expected that the market in this city will also be stabilized within one or two days.

Rice Merchants Demand Suppression of Production Prices

Mayor Wu met with rice merchants yesterday afternoon, and the rice merchants demanded suppression of production area prices. Mayor Wu said that he has asked the central government and the government of the producing area to take this measure. He hoped that the rice merchants could cooperate with the government and that market transactions would not exceed 1.8 million. Mayor Wu is also studying the technical problems of rice sales because the government's rice sales may be entirely absorbed and hoarded by rice merchants, and will issue a statement today.

Social Affairs Bureau Sells 10,000 Dan of Rice Daily

Another report: Mayor Wu told reporters last night that this rice price surge was purely affected by price fluctuations in rice-producing areas. Mayor Wu specifically requested the central government yesterday to immediately order each producing area to find ways to control rice prices. The municipal government is still ordering the Bureau of Social Affairs to continue to sell 10,000 dan of rice per day to meet market demand. Furthermore, when Mayor Wu convened rice merchants for discussions yesterday, the rice merchants stated that they would find ways to stabilize rice values ​​and guaranteed that rice prices would not exceed 1.98 million yuan.

Coarse Grains and Flour Follow and Rise Wildly

Another report: Yesterday's off-exchange rice prices rose even faster, and cargo owners insisted on not selling, creating a tense situation. White japonica rice hit a new high of 2.05 million yuan. Yangxian and Bo rice have both reached the 2 million mark.

Flour rose sharply and continuously. There was only entry and no exit on the market. A few off-exchange transactions saw prices soaring by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Old car flour once saw a peak of 900,000 yuan. Wheat bran immediately rose to the daily limit. Large bags of wheat bran were 488,000 yuan, and later rose to 510,000 yuan off-exchange.

Later, manufacturers opened slightly in response to demand, and the market turned flat, falling as low as 4.4 million yuan in the aftermarket, but still ended up rising 200,000 yuan. Both raw and cooked vegetable oil rose by more than 200,000 yuan. Small car sesame oil rose sharply by a huge amount of 650,000 yuan, and soybean cake also rose by about 120,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Bids Firm and High

Although the foreign firm tea market was still quiet yesterday, the Benjie and various gangs continued to inquire about various types of tea. Shop owners still believed that because the production and inventory were depleted and the rising rice prices made people feel even better, bidding was frequently raised. Until the market closed, give and take negotiations were still stuck in a mutual holding pattern, and red trading was difficult to start, but the trend was brilliant and extraordinary, and prices were further increased compared to before.

Yesterday's cigarette market saw excellent sales in the morning because the door stores were selling well. Fellow businesses continued to buy and were still smooth. Even floating positions were supplemented. The market continued to be excellent. In the afternoon, China Tobacco Company will process the distribution of "Double Happiness" and "Quanlu" cigarettes today (18th). The matching price is 140,000 yuan per carton of Double Axes and 68,000 yuan per carton of Quanlu. China-Philippine Company will also distribute "Shipowner Brand" cigarettes, and Dahua Company will generally distribute "Paul Kang" cigarettes. When the supply increased, the market suddenly declined. As a result, the prices of the ten-pack of old British knives and two cigarettes both fell back by 500,000 to 1.3 million compared with the previous day. The other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also fell across the board by amounts ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 yuan.

### Concealed Reporting of Straw Hats for Export Discovered by Jianghai Customs

[Our Report] At the beginning of January this year, it was rumored in this port that an export firm organized smuggling and concealed reporting of straw hats for export, which was detained by the customs. Although this matter has been silent for many days, the relevant authorities have secretly investigated the truth. They first started to turn over the information in the export license application forms of the designated banks that the suspected firm usually dealt with. It was discovered that the straw hats detained by the customs were owned by Fuyuanhua Firm and Xilun Firm. The total number was 8,300 dozen Suzhou hats and 300 dozen golden silk straw hats, with a total value of approximately US$70,000. Because there was a trick of reporting more for less and mixing low-value straw hats with high-value goods in order to secretly exchange foreign exchange, the Jianghai Customs detained them. As for the merchants involved in the inquiry, it is said that they have been found to be uninvolved, and the competent authorities are thoroughly investigating those who have actually engaged in smuggling.

### China Textile Construction Actively Sells, and Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise

[Our Report] In recent days, the cotton cloth market has been firm due to loose money. The China Textile Construction Company has been actively selling cotton cloth since the Lunar New Year in order to regulate supply and demand. In addition to the cotton cloth sold yesterday, 43,170 bolts of cloth were sold on the 14th, with a value of 66,440,800 yuan; on the 16th, yarn was sold, with 1,523 pieces being sold at posted prices, with a value of 81,196,580 yuan. 1,435 pieces were sold on the market, with a value of 69,000,000 yuan. On the same day, woolens were also sold, with a value of 16,200,000 yuan. The total value of yarn, cloth, and woolens sold in two days was 232,830,000 yuan.

The cotton yarn market yesterday was stable at the beginning. Later, due to the activities of outside funds, bids rose again. Although the China Textile Construction Company was still listing prices and accepting applications from fellow businesses in the middle of the way, the market sentiment was slightly soft. Soon, the price rose again because the Benke gang had good real needs and most people were optimistic. The 42-count blue phoenix fine yarn actually sold for more than 720,000 yuan, reaching a new peak of 70.6 million yuan. At the close of the day, it continued to rise by 1.6 million yuan compared to the previous day. The 21-count black horse spot goods were absorbed by all parties, reaching a high of 46.7 million yuan, a further increase of 2.4 million yuan. The other coarse and fine yarns all rose by varying amounts of 700,000, 800,000, and 1 million yuan.

The Yarn Control Committee continued to entrust the China Textile Construction Company to sell yarn at the Yarn Industry Association yesterday. The total number of yarn sold was around 1,100 pieces, equivalent to approximately 1,700 pieces of 20-count yarn. The prices of each grade of 20-count yarn ranged from 42 million yuan to 44 million yuan. The purchase permits could not be filled out and issued on the same day and will be issued this morning at 9:00 am.

### Yarn Merchants Demand Higher Commissions, Market Suspended Once

The cotton yarn market was suspended once yesterday morning, so the prices of each count of yarn were not released until noon. It is reported that the reason for the suspension was the issue of commissions for yarn merchants in cotton yarn transactions. According to regulations, manufacturers and merchants must entrust yarn merchants to the market to complete transactions for buying and selling cotton yarn. The yarn merchants then extract commissions from the number of transactions. The commission calculation was previously set at 50,000 yuan per piece for 20-count yarn, and ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 yuan for yarn above 20 counts. However, because prices have risen in recent years and the price of cotton yarn transactions has also increased significantly, yarn merchants feel that the originally set commission amount is too small. In addition, the number of entrusted purchases and sales is decreasing daily, and daily transactions are only a few packages as a unit, so commission income is even more meager. Before the market opened yesterday, yarn merchants unanimously stated that they would not open for trading unless the commission was doubled, but the other party could not express acceptance, which led to a deadlock in the negotiations, and the yarn market had not opened for trading until 11:30 am. Later, after both parties reached an understanding, it was decided to resume trading first and then negotiate again. Transactions began near noon.

The cotton cloth market yesterday morning was strong due to loose money, and the Benke gang and fellow businesses were pulling prices up strongly. Dyeing factories had a strong appetite for low-grade fine cloth. The buying sentiment in the market was strong, and the market rose tortuously. However, after 10 o'clock, because China Textile Construction Company listed prices and started selling Longtou fine cloth, market sentiment suddenly weakened. Retail investors were afraid that the market would be weak and closed out a lot. A few of the North Gang also spit it out, and there was a sudden situation of supply exceeding demand. The market also saw a slight setback. Until the noon close, people were still excited, and the Benjie stores continued to buy, so as a result, only Longtou fine cloth fell back by 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day, at 2.03 million yuan. Low-grade fine cloth such as Wufu Caiqiu Zhenzhong continued to rise from 20,000 to 150,000 yuan because the factory demand was not bad. The trend for the whole day was still strong for the rest of the cloth, except for the relatively weak Qiunzi wool and Zhigong cloth.

### The Transportation Management Committee Drafts Concrete Measures to Promote Major Export Materials: Producers, Transporters, Salespeople, and Exporters Can All Get Loans

[Our Report] The Transportation Management Committee attaches great importance to developing the export industry and is now considering providing financial loan assistance. It is reported that in the future, financial assistance to the export industry will be divided into three stages. Before the export materials are transported out of the place of production, they can be mortgaged for loans. This is the first stage. From the place of production to the port of export, it can be changed to domestic acceptance, which is the second stage. From the port of export to foreign countries, a discount loan is made, which is the third stage. This will allow exporters to obtain government funds that can be used cyclically in the production, transportation, and sales processes. However, it is limited to important export materials such as silk, tea, tung oil, and pig bristles, and those who do have fixed sales markets abroad. The Transportation Management Committee is drafting specific measures, which can be discussed and implemented in the near future.

### Rayon Falls, Silk Goods Decline

Yesterday's rayon market fell. No. 120 Asahi's bright rayon fell within the 100 million yuan mark at the opening in the morning. Market sentiment was quite soft, and trading was extremely slow. At the noon closing, it was bid at 98 million yuan. The largest increase in the afternoon was to above the 100 million yuan mark, but in the end it still fell to 98 million yuan due to uneven supply and demand. Tianqiao, Dongyang, etc. all followed and declined.

Yesterday's factory trade was slightly soft. Five packages of Grade C products were traded for 100.3 million yuan. Five dan heads of grade D origin were actually sold for ten packages at a price of 100 million yuan, which was the same as the previous day's market. No transactions were made for other brands. There were also no transactions for dried tendons. Bids were unchanged.

Yesterday's silk goods market declined. Because market sentiment was weak, Huaqiang real silk quilt was lowered to within the 6 million yuan mark at the opening. Afterwards, it was in a revolving state. The closing price was 6.2 million yuan. Dacheng checkered crepe first fell to within the 190,000 yuan mark and closed at 192,000 yuan. Huajin crepe and feathers all fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The bids for other goods were mostly unchanged.

### Prices of Chinese Medicine Rise

The Chinese medicine market has been affected by soaring prices, and prices have been reported to be rising in various places. The mainland uses rice prices as the standard, plus railway transportation and ship freight rates are constantly rising. The cost of incoming goods is increasing step by step, causing drug prices to rise slowly, threatening the poor and the sick.

Yesterday, the Zhejiang gang Yuan Hu Suo's top-grade goods opened at 60,000, but the Exchange Gang looked at the situation and then returned slightly to 40,000 to trade. Bottom-grade inferior goods were 26,000. The transaction was thin. The highest price of Ophiopogon japonicus was 140,000 yuan. The bottom-grade package surface was 44,000, which was considered stable. Western plums, general goods were 60,000 yuan, and there were quite a few transactions.

### Another Meeting: A Movie Script (3)

— Zhang Dao

20. Refugee Hospital Gate

The gate of the Guiyang First Refugee Hospital. Several visitors come and go. A Red Cross ambulance arrives. (This kind of vehicle is just a large truck with a canvas cover.) The hospital staff immediately come out and move the wounded and sick refugees from the vehicle one by one. The first to be moved out is an injured old woman from the countryside. Next is a seriously ill scholar who looks like a university professor, supported by his wife as he gets out of the car and enters the hospital. The last to be moved out is a girl of about eight years old (namely He Xiuzhen), whose leg is injured and is still unconscious.

21. Convalescent Room

After the wounded and sick people are moved into the hospital's convalescent room, Dr. Li Jiren and female doctor Zheng Jingye (Jingye is now thirty-three or thirty-four years old) enter the ward with nurses. They first examine the university professor, then examine the old woman from the countryside. Suddenly, in a corner of the ward, a female patient on a hospital bed screams in pain and shouts loudly, "Has my husband arrived?" The doctors and other patients, wounded, can't help but be disturbed. Dr. Zheng immediately goes over to comfort her. Dr. Li and the nurse walk to the bed of the injured girl. The girl moans in pain. Dr. Li opens her wrapped leg to take a look. At this time, Dr. Zheng also walks over to examine her together.

Jiren: (Speaking to Jingye) This child's leg injury is very serious. It is already very swollen. Surgery is necessary.

Jingye: Yes. We will operate on her immediately.

Jiren: Will you notify the operating room to prepare quickly?

Jingye: Okay.

22. Operating Room

The door of the operating room of the First Refugee Hospital opens. A mobile hospital bed. He Xiuzhen, who has just undergone surgery, is pushed out from inside. Dr. Li is still wearing the clothes he wore during the surgery. He is still wearing a leather glove on his left hand. The mask on his mouth has not been removed. Dr. Zheng is also wearing the same clothes, but the gloves and mask have been removed. Dr. Li stands inside the operating room door, watching Dr. Zheng and the nurse push the mobile hospital bed into a small single room.

Jingye: (Watching the child closely. The child's eyes are closed. She looks very painful. Dr. Zheng sighs and says.) Alas! How pitiful!

Nurse: Will she be disabled?

Jingye: Probably not. Let her sleep.

(The doctor and nurse quietly walk out.)

23. Small Room Ward

(End of December, Year 33 [1944])

After a considerable amount of time has passed, Xiuzhen's (Xiuzhen is now eight years old) leg injury has gradually healed. She is also very awake. She is flipping through a picture book on the bed in a small single ward. Jingye walks into the ward.

Xiuzhen: (The girl sees Dr. Zheng coming in and smiles.) Dr. Zheng.

Jingye: Does it still hurt?

Xiuzhen: Thank you, it doesn't hurt anymore. (Smiles, then suddenly looks worried.) Dr. Zheng, will I become a cripple?

Jingye: As long as you listen to me and rest well, you definitely won't be crippled.

Xiuzhen: I will definitely listen to you.

Jingye: Can you remember many things from before now?

Xiuzhen: I can remember.

Jingye: Your surname is He, and your name is Xiuzhen?

Xiuzhen: Yes.

Jingye: How old are you this year?

Xiuzhen: Eight years old.

Jingye: Where is your home, what are your parents' names?

Xiuzhen: My home is in Shanghai, my mother's name is Guo Canyun. My father's name is He Qi.

Jingye: (Hearing the name He Qi, she is very surprised. Suddenly, a little louder.) What? He Qi?

Xiuzhen: (Looking at her a little strangely) Yes.

Jingye: Do you have any siblings?

Xiuzhen: No, not one. (Jingye pondered this point for a moment.)

Jingye: How did you get to Guizhou?

Xiuzhen: My mother told me that after the war in Shanghai, we moved to Guilin to live. Later, my father went to Singapore and never came back. A while ago, my mother said that the Japanese soldiers were coming to Guilin, so she took me and ran away. Later, our things were lost or robbed. At first, we had a car to ride in, but later the car was gone too. My mother took me and walked with many, many people. One day, we walked to a place. There was an air raid alarm. My mother and I followed the others to escape the air raid. There were too many people. We were separated. Then the bombs exploded with a roar. After that, I don't know anything. (Xiuzhen cried as she said this.) My mother also doesn't know where she went. (She cried even more after saying this.)

Jingye: (Comforting Xiuzhen very kindly.) Don't cry. We have entrusted people to inquire about your mother's whereabouts at various refugee shelters.

Xiuzhen: (Holding Jingye's hand and pleadingly asking.) You will definitely find my mother.

Jingye: I think we will find her.

24. Dr. Zheng's Office

(February, Year 34 [1945])

Dr. Zheng is in the hospital's office. Jingye is absentmindedly holding a photo of a child on her desk. (This photo is the one that Jingye took when she was discharged from the hospital and kept in her handbag.) (Close-up) She looks at the photo while recalling Xiuzhen's appearance. (Flashback to previous scenes.) Suddenly, Dr. Li Jiren brings Mr. Qin Ming from the Social Service Department in. Jingye immediately puts the photo in a book.

Jiren: Dr. Zheng, this is Mr. Qin from the Social Service Department. He is here to talk to you about He Xiuzhen.

Jingye: Mr. Qin, please sit down, Dr. Li, please sit down too. (They all sit opposite Jingye's desk in the office.)

Qin Ming: Dr. Zheng, we have inquired at all the refugee shelters, and we have also published announcements in the refugee service column of the newspaper for many days, but there is still no trace of He Xiuzhen's mother.

Jingye: There is nothing we can do about that. This child is healed now. She is always thinking about her mother. Sigh! This child is really pitiful. What will happen to her after she leaves the hospital?

Qin Ming: I am here today to discuss this matter with both of you.

Jingye: What do you plan to do with her?

Qin Ming: We are now planning to send her to the wartime children's home run by Madame Chiang in Chongqing.

Jingye: Ah! (Seeming surprised and disapproving.)

Qin Ming: Dr. Zheng, what do you think?

Jingye: (Speaking to Li and Qin) Shall we call Xiuzhen in and ask her?

Li Qin: Okay.

Jingye: (Pressing the bell on the desk, a nurse comes in.) Tell her to bring He Xiuzhen here.

Jiren: This child is very lovable, it would be best if someone would adopt her.

Qin Ming: In normal times, many people would want her. Under these circumstances, I am afraid it will not be easy to find a suitable person to adopt her.

(The nurse brings Xiuzhen in, puts her down on the ground. She is holding a small walking stick. She can walk slowly now.)

Jingye: Xiuzhen, can you slowly walk over here?

Xiuzhen: Um. (Everyone watches her slowly walk to Jingye's side.)

Jingye: Mr. Qin, please tell her.

Qin Ming: Little sister, we haven't found your mother yet. Your injury is almost healed. There are many patients here. We plan to send you to the Chongqing Children's Home. Your mother will come there to find you in the future.

Xiuzhen: (Looking at everyone, not daring to answer. Then bursts into tears.) No! I won't go! I won't go anywhere! If I can't find my mother, I will stay with Dr. Zheng. (Hugging Jingye tightly.)

Jingye: (Very moved.) Stay with me? (Looking at Li and Qin.)

Xiuzhen: I want to stay with you, because you treat me well.

Jingye: I am busy taking care of patients all day long, how can I have time to take care of you?

Xiuzhen: I won't make trouble, I will be obedient, I will cook my own meals, okay?

Jingye: (Very touched, smiling.) Won't you cook for me?

Xiuzhen: (Quickly.) I will, I will.

(Li and Qin look at each other and smile. It seems like they have a new idea.)

Qin Ming: Dr. Zheng, this child is very lovable. It would be very good if you could adopt her.

Jiren: Looking at it this way, I am afraid Dr. Zheng will have to agree.

Jingye: Mr. Qin, this child is both lovable and pitiful. If your department thinks it is okay to entrust her to me for adoption, then I will temporarily adopt her. When her parents are found, I will be responsible for handing her over to them.

Qin Ming: That's great! Let's do it that way.

(Qin takes his leave. Li accompanies him out. Jingye hugs Xiuzhen in her arms. The nurse watches from the side, happy.)

25. Guiyang Bus Station

(May, Year 34 [1945])

Dr. Zheng Jingye resigns from the hospital. She takes Xiuzhen from Guiyang to Chongqing. They are in front of a bus station in Guiyang. A large bus is starting up, ready to depart. Her colleague Li Jiren and several nurses come to the station to see her off. The bus is already full of people. There are still many people with luggage outside the bus who cannot get on, envying those already on the bus. Jingye: (When the bus is about to depart, to the people seeing her off.) Thank you, everyone, goodbye.

(She shakes hands and says goodbye to the people seeing her off individually. She turns to call Xiuzhen. Xiuzhen bids farewell to everyone.)

Xiuzhen: (Bowing to the people seeing her off.) Goodbye! Goodbye!

Nurse: Goodbye! Xiuzhen! You won't forget me, will you?

Xiuzhen: No, Aunt Zhao! (Seeming like she is about to cry.)

Jiren: Dr. Zheng, don't forget to write letters. I hope we will meet again soon.

Jingye: (Smiling to the guests seeing her off.) I hope the war of resistance will be victorious soon. It would be even better if we could meet in Nanjing. (The bus driver urges her to get on the bus.) Okay! Xiuzhen! Get on the bus. Goodbye, everyone!

Jingye and Xiuzhen: (After squeezing into the bus door, the bus departs, and the two wave to their friends seeing them off.) Goodbye!

Friends seeing them off: Goodbye!

The wheels of the bus turn. There is a tattered slogan on the ground that reads "Japanese imperialism," and other words. The wheels roll over it, leaving only the words "Japanese."

26. Chongqing City Street A

(Evening of August 10, Year 34 [1945]) Slogan: Japan Surrenders, Long Live China! (O.S. Sounds of firecrackers)

At this moment, the streets are crowded with people. The masses are celebrating wildly. Many large trucks and small cars are coming and going. They are all filled with people. Allied forces are also driving by in jeeps. Firecrackers are being set off everywhere here and there. The people marching are all beaming with joy, waving their hands and feet. They shout "Japan Surrendered!" "The War of Resistance is Victorious!" "Long Live the Republic of China!" "Long Live the Chinese Nationalist Party!" "Support the National Government!" "Long Live Chairman Chiang!" and other slogans. There are also various large lanterns that have been temporarily set up. On them are written "Celebrate the Victory of the War of Resistance!" and the various slogans mentioned above. After a while, gongs and drums are sounding, and the lion dancers come out. Suddenly, groups of citizens gather into lines, with gongs and drums as guides, and join in. A military band appears, playing military music loudly. Behind them is a large team of armed comrades marching in formation. Many jeeps carrying Allied forces with foreign women or women service personnel from the military appear one after another. The Allied forces mostly stick out their thumbs, saying to the Chinese people, "China is great!" "Chairman Chiang is great!" The people also respond with "America is great!" "The American army is great!" etc.

Some of them are on the vehicles, and some are walking. They are holding bottles and drinking alcohol. Some are also singing various foreign songs together. Many people are vying to shake hands with them. Etc. A lively situation.

27. Chongqing City Street B

(Afternoon of September 3, Year 34 [1945])

The wartime capital Chongqing celebrates the official surrender memorial for Japan's surrender. The great parade of the people of the wartime capital.

Chairman Chiang inspects the parade. Receives cheers from the people. Evening celebration with lantern displays, etc. Zheng Jingye takes Xiuzhen to observe on the side of the road.

Jingye: Xiuzhen, did you see Chairman Chiang?

Xiuzhen: I saw him.

Jingye: He is the great leader who led the Chinese people to defeat Japan.

Xiuzhen: I saluted him just now, I don't know if he saw me.

Jingye: He will have seen you. Xiuzhen, we are going back to Shanghai soon, are you happy?

Xiuzhen: Happy! Going back to Shanghai by plane!

Jingye: That's right, by plane!

### Snowstorm

— Chen Jian

Like the sunflower's affection

Our longings wish to burn with the sun

The groundhog has not awakened from hibernation

The warm wind on the sea has also forgotten the date of its return

Coldness attacks the aging mountains and forests everywhere

The incessant rain, ah

(This shameless accomplice)!

More and more, day and night

Beating against the desolate winter

Wandering travelers

Are thus trapped in this season of wind and snow…

The sky, covered with a bag of tears, ah…

Like an ox plowing the icy and snowy land with a sigh

We also come from that bloodless

Between dawn and darkness

Exploring our path today

Or writing, in a daze

Night travelers stepping on slippery ice and snow

Asking who has ever thought of the ragged wanderers

Enduring the mud on life's journey

Rain, ah, snow, ah

Suffocating the long-frozen loneliness

Wind and frost grow even denser…

Perhaps pitying the hardship of the wanderers

During the morning, while loading goods onto the plank bridge

Birds are sleeping soundly in the eaves corners

Wind and rain smear a day

The rooster is too lazy to offend a good dream with its crowing

The dancer sighs, stroking his sword:

"Who knows

Where the sun has gone…"

(Copied from an old draft from Yueping at the end of the 36th year [1947])

Ballet Letters

After Hardy's funeral, Barrie (James M. Barrie) wrote a letter to Mrs. Hardy saying, "I want you to know that not only does Hardy's greatness amaze me. Even if he were just an ordinary person - I would still think he is one of the most lovable people I know." Such words can also be used for Barrie himself. His good friends included Mason (A.E.W. Mason), Quiller-Couch, Smith (Turley Smitn), the best writer of children's stories today), Scott (famous for Arctic exploration), Priestley (J.B. Priestley), Lewis (Eiluned Lewis, in 1934 Barrie sincerely welcomed his "Grass on the Dew") and his loyal secretary, Mrs. Cynthia Asquith. They all said Barrie was a happy person; even the "Barrie Letters" now published clearly show that he knew happiness, often enjoyed happiness, no matter how difficult and troubled his life was. He said, "Those who give happiness to others cannot keep happiness for themselves." He said to Mrs. Asquith, "You are not a person who shouts loudly for happiness," which can also be applied to himself.

How endlessly, pleasantly, and happily he gave happiness to people can also be seen from these letters, dating from 1884 to 1937, but unfortunately, there is very little about his early writer life. Most noteworthy is that all the letters have some content, not just reports of careless events.

Undoubtedly, Barrie himself thought he was a silent child. In 1909, he wrote to Quiller-Couch saying, "I fantasize about creating an artificial world for myself, because the real world I live in seems too melancholic. How stubbornly my pen wants to seek happiness!" The writers he read, besides Hardy, were mostly happy writers. These letters do not talk much about books and authors. He did not like Lawrence (D.H. Lawrence) much, saying that the first chapter of his "The Lost Girl" was too stiff; he praised writers with fluent writing and the best storytellers. He said it should be written out, not forced out. In 1893, he told Quiller-Couch, "That's right! Because this is Hardy's natural product. Indeed, that is everything. Blessedly, this novelist never thought about how he should write." He also told Asquith that Stella Benson's book was too difficult to understand. "She is a brilliant figure with brains, but I simply cannot grasp what her main purpose is in writing this book." What disappoints us is that the letters talk a lot about his own works. He talked about many plays, especially "The Boy David."

The merit of these letters is not easy for readers to know unless they are familiar with his friends and the background of his writing.

It is hoped that this book will arouse readers' interest in studying Barrie, and it is hoped that this book will have a sequel.

Biography of Lafcadio Hearn

Lafcadio Hearn is our acquaintance. His books such as "Literary Interpretation" and "Poets and Poetry" are clear and easy to understand, making you reluctant to put them down after reading them. Recently, Harry E. Wedeck wrote a biography of Lafcadio Hearn, titled "Mortal Hunger," which is a novel-style biography written with great enthusiasm. It tirelessly traces every step of Lafcadio Hearn's journey, from the Greek islands through Paris and New Orleans all the way to Japan. The entire journey is clearly painted with strong colors by Lafcadio Hearn. It is written with genuine emotion, but it is not deeply moving. But Lafcadio Hearn still does not lose his brilliant personality, he is a fearless romanticist.

He was only five feet tall and always a foreigner (later, most tragically, he even entered Japanese customs, he suddenly lost one eye. He understood loneliness. Unfortunately, he could not easily get a large number of reference books in Japan, so it limited the splendor of his works.

Lafcadio Hearn handles his material very well, because he relies on air: for example, Chinese legends ("Several Chinese Ghosts"), New Orleans customs, British and East Indian folklore, and local folk stories.

We must analyze a writer's psychological process. To understand a writer, one must see from the inside to the outside. Wedeck's narrative seems to be superficial. We do not need a bibliographical list, we must say how a certain book was produced, how it was written, and what the author felt when writing. Wedeck has not yet done these things.

Wedeck seems reluctant to take big steps when narrating, and often retreats gently. For example, when writing about Lafcadio Hearn's terrible and strange personal life, the stimulation he received from losing one eye was great. He approached a woman, but Wedeck refused to continue, and closed the curtain. What we want to know is Lafcadio Hearn's reaction to this event in a state of high emotion, but now it is tightly concealed in the silence of the novel biographer, is that not greatly diminished? But we are finally lucky enough to see a sensitive soul under the pen of deep sympathy. He is perpetually pursuing, perpetually wandering, gesticulating and talking a lot, with a bit of foolishness, mostly out of sincerity, he is a sensory adventurer. If Wedeck could handle this biography more objectively, his achievements would be even greater, and he would have more important things to say.

### My Views on Banning Dancing

— Ze Shi

I recently saw in the newspaper that the Municipal Social Security Promotion Association held a standing council meeting and decided to "seek opinions from all walks of life on the issue of banning dancing and submit them to the central government for reference." I have long wanted to speak on the issue of banning dancing, and now I want to speak "opportunistically."

The reason for banning dancing, according to the newspaper, is for "economy." Saving what? Saving energy? Dancers are probably expending energy, but what other use will they and she be moved to if they are saved? What good is it to the country and society if a fire breaks out? Saving money? That is even more unnecessary. For individuals, saving money is appropriate, but the purpose of the country's vigorous economy should be to avoid wasting scarce materials, for example, there is very little gasoline left, so order Shanghai to stop using cars for a week, starting with the mayor, there is not much coal left, so tell all agencies to stop using stoves and stop burning water heaters for two weeks, ... this is true economy, very beneficial to the country, because these things are used less and less, and cannot be used and still be there. The banknotes in the people's pockets are not like that. Dancers use them, dance girls and dance hall workers get them, and the total amount must not be short one cent or one dime, let them trade and retreat, each gets what they want, and fundamentally what is the damage to the country?

Therefore, from the point of view of economy - a true economy that helps the national economy - there is no need to ban dancing. If it is said that foreign wines and foreign cigarettes are inevitably sold in dance halls, and dance girls inevitably apply foreign greasepaint and powder, which will waste foreign exchange, then may I suggest: to truly save foreign exchange, please ban the screening of foreign films first, or at least implement it at the same time as banning dancing.

Finally, a statement: I have never danced in my life, and none of my family members or friends rely on dancing for a living, so the opposition to banning dancing is purely public-spirited, with no selfish intentions, just as the gentlemen who advocate banning dancing did not suffer from dancing and came up with this, and are indeed sincerely for the country.

### Auspicious Words

The magpie and the crow are both small birds with unremarkable appearances. The magpie is liked for its melodious singing, which makes it a beloved animal. The crow, despite its glossy black feathers, is considered inauspicious because it often caws obnoxiously at the wrong time, and thus never receives the master's favor or reward. People always like to have their praises sung; who would perversely enjoy listening to unpleasant noise and curses?

For example, during these days of the New Year festival, everyone wants to have good luck. Those whose luck was bad last year hope to have good fortune from now on, and those who had a decent year hope to make further progress this year. Whether it's family members or colleagues you meet daily, the first words you hear are no longer discouraging phrases like "can't survive" or mentions of "firewood, rice, oil, and salt." Instead, they're replaced with auspicious phrases like "Congratulations, congratulations" and "May everyone prosper." Even if it's clear that the other person's situation is hardly cause for celebration, and even if you know you'll never become rich in your lifetime, you still offer good wishes and prayers. You have to force a smile, especially if you've read the classics in your youth and adhere to Confucius's principle that "a gentleman is refined after possessing both substance and cultivation." At times like these, you must focus on "cultivation." Otherwise, if someone congratulates you and you respond with a gloomy face, asking where the joy comes from, wouldn't both parties be embarrassed and violate common courtesy?

In general, being able to do things according to one's own interests and will is a supreme pleasure. Conversely, the most painful thing is not being able to express one's suffering, putting on a brave face while feeling miserable, knowing something is wrong but having to pretend it isn't, knowing something is false but having to pretend it's true. Those who dare to laugh and scold, who can cry and fight, are straightforward people. If you can't laugh out loud or cry openly, and you depend on others' opinions and facial expressions, you're in the most miserable position in the world. If the coming year brings peace and prosperity to the nation, then when this annual holiday arrives, people will naturally offer heartfelt congratulations and blessings. The words will be sweet on their lips and in their hearts, and hearing auspicious words will surely enhance everyone's joy. Unfortunately, in these times of war and chaos, the cold faces of creditors on New Year's Eve are vaguely before our eyes, and the ominous rumors of future layoffs and salary cuts linger in our ears. Though the words we speak are invariably auspicious and peaceful, our hearts are like overturned five-flavored bottles, filled with an indescribable mixture of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, spiciness, and saltiness.

Perhaps auspicious words are one reason why people act so falsely towards each other. For example, if someone's father dies, death is death, and everyone has to die eventually. But people avoid the word "death." To the deceased's son, they say "passed away as an immortal" or "returned to heaven." Yet, who knows if they were secretly cursing the old man for not dying sooner? Pretense is bad morality, but if pretense becomes a habit, it also becomes a social norm. It seems that not pretending is a lack of social graces, while following the habit of pretense is considered good etiquette, making you a "superior person." I remember when teachers taught children to "know books and understand etiquette." On one hand, they told children to remember and follow moral character, honesty, simplicity, and sincerity. On the other hand, they taught them the habits of responding to elders, showing that although our country has always valued morality and promoted simplicity, ritualistic pretense, such as saying auspicious words, is not only permitted but also highly commendable. Tsze-yew, denounced by the English literary giant Johnson as a "dancing boy" and "prostitute," specialized in teaching young men to pretend and use auspicious words to beg for food. His philosophy was: since saying auspicious words gets you food, people should learn to say auspicious words.

There are many people in the world who make a living by saying auspicious words. The matchmakers at weddings in the past were the best representatives of this type of person, spouting sweet words and auspicious phrases, promising wealth and honor, and many descendants. The families involved had no choice but to give them lucky envelopes and a feast. Don't think that this is an easy job; in fact, it's very hard work. First, you must put your own emotions aside and banish your own thoughts. Then, when you see people laughing, you must also laugh loudly, even more joyfully than they do. When you see people crying, you must also shed a few tears, and even cry more sorrowfully than they do. With this skill, you can win the master's handouts, and you won't have to worry about food and clothing anywhere. To some, this may seem easy, but to those who are not good at observing faces and distinguishing emotions, it is by no means a simple task. Because if you are not careful, serving your master is like serving a tiger; you might not get the handout and instead get a beating!

I'm straying further and further from the topic, and my words are not only inauspicious but also seem a bit tiresome and annoying. I should stop quickly and say "Congratulations and be prosperous" to avoid being called a "crow"!

### Leisurely Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (73)

Little Wang's mother poured a cup of tea and handed it to Zhuzhai, who then asked: "When the boss left for the exam today, did he say anything?" Little Wang's mother saw the anxious expression on Zhuzhai's face and really wanted to tell him about Xu Yuru's visit to Qihuan today, and Qihuan's painful and chaotic situation. But she was afraid that if she said these words, it would only increase Zhuzhai's sadness, and she didn't understand what was going on, so she didn't dare to speak rashly. She only shook her head and said: "The boss didn't say anything before leaving." After Little Wang's mother said this, she sat down on a small stool and muttered, "Head," but she was just thinking, seeing this situation, I'm afraid something is going to happen. The boss's situation when he went out today was different from usual. It seems that this matter is related to that old man Xu, but since the boss has ordered me not to say anything, how can I tell Mr. Xu? While thinking, she looked at Zhuzhai, saw him sitting on the sofa, leaning back on the sofa back, his face pale, his eyes closed, shaking his head from time to time, and asked: "Mr. Xu, you said you fell on the road, does your body still hurt? Don't get hurt!" As she spoke, she stood up and walked to Zhuzhai. Zhuzhai opened his eyes, held his waist with one hand, and said: "I feel sore here." Little Wang's mother smiled and said: "Mr. Xu, do you remember? Last time you fell in the alley, you twisted your leg, and I massaged it for you. Otherwise, you take off your clothes and let me take a look, and a massage will be fine." Zhuzhai said: "I'm too lazy to move, it doesn't matter." Little Wang's mother saw that Zhuzhai didn't want to take off his clothes, and sat back on the chair, her eyes only looking at Zhuzhai. Zhuzhai closed his eyes, because Little Wang's mother had just said that he had fallen in the alley last time, which brought up the past. He thought that at that time, he and Qihuan were still in the trial stage, not like now, when they were painfully in love, and that time he wasn't hurt at all, it was all fake. This evening's fall was not light, but he couldn't care about it. As long as Qihuan can come back safely, even if I get hurt, I am willing. Zhuzhai thought for a while, and then opened his eyes, saw the clock on the wall, and saw Little Wang's mother sitting opposite him, her starry eyes still fixed on his face, and frowned and said: "The boss hasn't come back yet, it's really worrying!"

### On [Gimmicks] and the Like

— Xuanxuan

Reynolds, the American ballpoint pen king, went to Nanjing, carrying a ballpoint pen of his own brand, and took pictures everywhere. Nanjing reporters ridiculed him for having too much of a "business atmosphere," and even said that his launching of an aerial expedition to measure the "world's highest peak" was just a "gimmick" to advertise his ballpoint pens.

Regarding such accusations, from the standpoint of a Chinese person and a modern person, we can only smile wryly and simply cannot speak.

Since the Jishi Mountain in Qinghai may be the "world's highest peak," why do we, as the masters of the land, let an American businessman sell this "gimmick"? Why did our merchants not see this and insist on letting others take the limelight? "Worrying about others' success for fear of being poor yourself" is probably the biggest shortcoming of us Chinese people, besides self-intoxication in our 阿Q spirit.

I have no intention of "increasing others' ambition." The intellectual stagnation of our old country is nearing the point of no return. Apart from making money, 99.9% of Chinese people no longer have any higher interests. An expedition launched by a successful American businessman only serves to highlight that other businessmen still have an interest in learning. It is we ourselves who have too much of a "business atmosphere," seeking nothing but money.

Regardless of whether Reynolds is doing it for advertising or truly has an interest in exploration, at least others still understand how to "cultivate elegance." As for our merchants, or non-merchants who have made a fortune, they do not necessarily have that refinement. With gold and US dollars, or even just a few billion legal tender, they only want to go to the gambling halls and take concubines. Who still has a higher interest, such as exploration? The ancients ridiculed villagers, saying: when the bell tolls and the night ends, the white-haired old men, if they earn a few more bushels of wheat, will immediately take a concubine. It can be seen that the Chinese interest in taking concubines has been high since ancient times, and is now even more intense.

The old national vitality is lost. Now, we have become just a small pawn in the international chessboard of power politics. All we can boast about is "thousands of years of history," but this treasure trove of history must be developed by others, because we ourselves do not know that we have this treasure trove, or even if we know, we do not have the resources and interest to develop it. Today's Egypt, Iran, and India are similar. A country that only flaunts the word "ancient" is not something to be proud of.

### Withdrawing Pre-War Deposits

— Ji Mu

I went to the bank for a friend to withdraw pre-war deposits. I stood outside the iron fence, holding a stack of deposit slips in my hand. I waited patiently for the bank clerk to finish his private affairs. Finally, I handed in the deposit slips, waiting with a sense of loss to see him calculate the exchange rate of the deposits. I asked him with a shy face how much money there was. He told me that the total amount of 1,300 yuan, deposited separately five or six years ago, was now only worth 680,000 yuan. At the same time, he handed me a copper plate.

I turned to the "payment" window of this bank to withdraw money. Although this was not my own money, I seemed to be the most foolish person in the world under the gaze of the crowd. In their eyes, I seemed to be the only fool who didn't know how to buy goods and preserve the value of the currency, and watched the value of legal tender melt away like a piece of butter on a cake.

After a while, the cashier, after handling payments of 20 million, 30 million, 5 million, etc., called out the number on the copper plate I received, and gave me the "generous" sum of 690,000 yuan. I seemed to have concluded a long-pending case that had been unresolved for several years for my friend, and breathed a sigh of relief. But at the same time, I felt a heavy stone pressing on my chest, and I felt sorry for my friend.

Indeed, under this runaway inflation, many people's hard-earned savings have been left behind. According to the most basic interpretation of economics, money should have the functions of (1) a medium of exchange, (2) a measure of value, (3) a store of value, and (4) a standard of deferred payment... Currently, it seems that it can only be used for the first two purposes, while the latter two have long been abandoned. Naturally, we do not want to use a currency with incomplete functions. Currently, there are loud calls for currency reform, and one of the reasons may lie here.

### Foot Painting

— Yu Jianhua

During the Qing Dynasty, Gao Qipei painted with his fingers, calling himself "Finger Life." Since then, finger painting became popular in the painting world. In modern times, there are quite a few people who are good at finger painting, but no one has been heard of who paints with their toes. According to the history of painting, there are actually three people who can paint with their toes.

(1) Lu Ban: The Hundred Schools Book says: Gongshu Ban's water saw its reflection and said: See your shape. The leech then came out, and Ban drew a picture of it with his foot. See Customs and Meanings. Also, the Waterways Classic Commentary says: There used to be a portrait of Fuliushen. This god once spoke to Lu Ban, and Ban ordered him to come out. Fuliu said: My appearance is ferocious, and you are good at drawing objects. I cannot come out. Ban then bowed his hands and said to him: Come out and let me see you. Cunliu then came out. Ban then painted the ground with his feet. Cunliu felt it and immediately returned to the water, so the statue was placed in the water, only the back above stood on the water.

(2) Skillful Person: Emperor Qin Shi Huang sought to meet the Sea God. The god said: My appearance is ugly. If you can sketch my shape, I will meet with the Emperor. Emperor Shi Huang went into the sea for thirty li and met the god. There was a skillful person on his left and right who secretly drew the shape of the god with his feet. —Three Qi Brief Records.

(3) Zhang Heng: There is a beast named Haishen in the mountains of Pucheng County, Jianzhou. It has the body of a pig and the head of a human, and likes to come out on the rocks by the water. Pingzi (Zhang Heng) went to write about it. The beast entered the pool and did not come out. Someone said: This beast is afraid of people painting it, so it doesn't come out. You can remove the paper and pen. The beast did indeed come out. Pingzi bowed his hands and did not move. He secretly drew the beast with his toes. —Guo's Records of Strange Things.

Gongshu Ban and Lu Ban are commonly regarded as the same person. Lu Guo, a skilled craftsman from the Spring and Autumn Period, is referred to as Gongshu Pan in Mozi, Gongzhezi Lu Ban in Mengzi's commentary, and Gongshu Ban in Historical Records Annotation, Later Han Book Annotation, and Literary Selections Annotation. However, Morning and Evening Records says: "Lu Ban was a native of Dunhuang, Suzhou. His era is unknown. He possessed skills like creation. He once made a wooden kite, rode it, and flew. Gongzhe Ban of the Six Kingdoms also made a large kite to spy on Song City." It seems that they were two people. In fact, the words of Morning and Evening Records are not credible. It is more reliable to take the words of Mozi and Mengzi as one person.

Looking at the above four stories, although the names of people, gods, places, and times are different, their contents are by no means consistent. Using one's toes to paint the god in the water, and the god is ugly and afraid of being painted. Probably, there was such a legend in ancient times. As time went on, there were inevitably different versions of the story. At first glance, it seems to be three things, but in fact it is an evolution of one story. Which of the three people can actually paint with their toes? Of course, it is impossible to verify now, but due to the spread of this kind of story, it is sufficient to show the possibility of foot painting. Before the war, there was a "Universal Foot" in Shanghai. He was born without hands, and his two feet could perform all kinds of skills. He often performed publicly, but now I don't know where he went. It is a pity that I have never seen him paint. Huang Ernan of Beiping can paint with his tongue, which is even stranger in the painting world.

### Chenhai Orchestra

Today, people all over the world are suffering from the heavy pressure of high prices, suffocating to the point of not being able to breathe. But on a small island in the northern Caribbean Sea, one US dollar can provide five times the material and comfort, driving countless Americans crazy. This is the third small island south of the United States, the Republic of Haiti, known to the world. The island of Haiti is full of romance, bright colors, and pleasant scenery.

It takes four hours to reach the capital, Port-au-Prince, by seaplane from Miami. The scenery anywhere else in the world cannot compare to this place. Stretching from the lush forested hills to the beach is this vibrant white city, shining in the sun. The dockworkers are carrying things, barefoot, showing off their muscles, shouting noisily. Some light-skinned mulattos, the wealthy aristocrats of Haiti, wearing the latest American fashions, pass by in luxurious cars in a flash. The roads are wide and flat, the buildings are new, and occasionally there are dirty streetcars and dilapidated thatched huts - these are the unforgettable capital sights of the Republic of Haiti.

Here, five hundred US dollars a year can make you live very comfortably.

There are clubs everywhere, golf and tennis courts, gorgeous salons and dining rooms, and two cinemas and a racetrack. The cuisine in the hotels, clubs, and dining rooms is all French. On the slowly rising slopes in the city, all the way to the top of the mountain, are the mansions of the Haitian elite.

The mansions of the elite are extremely beautiful, with pavilions, terraces, and gardens, lush lawns, and various exotic flowers and plants. You can have fresh flowers every day, all year round. These ultra-modern houses rent for about 40 to 150 dollars per month. The reason for the low prices is the original economic structure of Haiti - wealthy nobles and poor tenant farmers.

The prominent people in Haiti are generally not dark-skinned, have received higher education, and are highly cultured. According to a standard work, The Haitian People by James Leyburn, the local wealthy families trace their lineage back to French aristocracy. The wealthy families are in all strata of society, especially government officials, military leaders, or heads of major industries. They study in France and are intellectually equal to any upper class people in the world. Leyburn's book also mentions that there has never been a dispute between the nobles and the tenant farmers.

Ordinary Haitians are mostly farmers, with a small piece of land, exchanging sweat and blood for harvests of grains, beans, cotton, coffee, and tobacco. They are illiterate, let alone write.

The annual income of a farmer is almost equal to only one dollar and fifty cents in US dollars. Someone who has lived in Haiti for many years said: A villager accidentally had a fire, and the whole family was burned to ashes. But it only cost one dollar and twenty-five cents to restore it to its original state. The building materials were taken from the mud and thatch by the river. It took six days of labor, at fifteen cents a day, totaling ninety cents, and the remaining thirty-five cents was used to purchase furniture and other items.

People traveling to Haiti can rent a villa on the mountainside, with a swimming pool and tennis court and other facilities, which costs only as much as an ordinary apartment room in the United States. If they hire cooks, maids, male servants, laundresses, gardeners, drivers, etc. in the villa, the total wage cost is only fifty dollars per month.

The best beef is two cents a pound; a chicken is thirty cents; the world's best coffee is twelve cents a pound, and sugar is sixty cents a pound. Even a week-long grand banquet will not cost more than seventy-five dollars a month.

What Americans are worried about is that tourists are coming in droves, all wanting to find houses, which will inevitably cause prices to skyrocket. Haiti has remained virtually unchanged for a hundred years. As long as the country can maintain the status quo, it can truly be a paradise for recluses.

### My Hometown Yixing

When mentioning one's hometown, it is common to use "My". When using the word "My", no matter what the matter, there is usually some humility and some boasting. This can also be said to be a habit of the Chinese people, especially intellectuals. As long as the "humility" has roots and the "boasting" has evidence, it is okay to talk about it.

My hometown, Yixing, formerly known as Yangxian, is a small county on the southern coast of Jiangsu Province. It is neither located in a political hub like Jinling, where dragons coil and tigers crouch, nor in an economic center like Shenpu, a city of tens of thousands of foreign countries. Even compared to the prosperous cities of Suzhou and Yangzhou, it is far behind. Even the "no constancy once arrived" in the same prefecture, the so-called "Little Shanghai" and "Little Suzhou", my Yixing bows down to them. This is something that cannot but be suppressed and conceded.

However, there is the elegance of Su Shi, who bought fields to spend his old age there, and the unusual feats of General Zhou, who shot tigers and killed dragons. The Shanshan Zhanggong Caves are magnificent, and the Fuxi River is clear and shallow, so why envy the landscape of Guilin? Located at the crossroads of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, with the two paradises of Suzhou and Hangzhou on its left and right, it is called a famous and scenic spot. Who would say it is not suitable? As for the products, the purple clay pottery is exquisite in workmanship and materials, elegant and unparalleled. Compared with the famous porcelain of Ganzhou Jingzhen, each has its own strengths. It is not only famous in China, but also occupies a dominant position in foreign sales. It has long been a well-known product. These are all worth boasting about, and they are indeed not false.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi were still able to maintain considerable order, but my Yixing was repeatedly shelled, making significant sacrifices for the country. In 1938, my friend Xu Zhiying (a native of Yixing, a famous journalist) told me that the area around Weiqiao had been reduced to ruins, and he wept for it. Recently, I received a letter from Banmeng Weng (a clan elder and famous calligrapher and painter) showing his work on returning to Yixing after the war, which made me even more nostalgic. The poem says: (1) I wandered around the old site, the broken house did not need to be opened (Original note: I went to the wine shop with a friend, and most of the houses in my hometown did not have doors), the cattle days are exhausted, the new market, it is difficult to restore the old buildings in ten years. The small mountain village has remnant tiles, tea bowls and poems depicting the ash of the calamity. Fortunately, I have an old friend to shake hands with, pouring sorrow in the wine shop and on the street. (2) I endure tears to find the old traces in the wind, and walk slowly with long skills and depression. Life should be indulged in wine, where can I live happily in the troubled world! The scenic spots are no longer intact (Original note: the scenic spots outside the city are all destroyed), and half of the old friends are the remaining ashes of the calamity. If I can barely settle down, if I encounter war again, I am afraid that I will be a ruin again (Original note: the banditry is very tight now)! Yu Jingzhai and Banmeng wrote a poem after returning to their hometown after the calamity: "The clear spring is leisurely, the bamboo is twilight and yellow, and the road enters the flat embankment to know the old corridor (Original note: Yuefei's garrison, outside the south city of Yangxian), the red leaves are affectionate and long, and the green hills are intact and half lost (Original note: Yue Pavilion, Sishui Nunnery, and Red Leaf Corridor on the embankment are all destroyed in the war, and the Red Leaf Corridor plaque was written by Banmeng); ten years of war have left traces of old things, and I wander along the road to find the ancient wilderness, lamenting that there are few famous scholars passing the river, so I don't need to go to the drunk "Xiaochang" (wine name)." Reciting the works of two friends, not only the city was destroyed, but also the scenic spots and famous areas, and the people of the township were also wiped out. The suffering of the Japanese pirates in my Yixing was particularly cruel. I sigh that the bomb hit Nagasaki, that the way of heaven is good for repayment, and the retribution is not bad. Comparing the two, it is quite gratifying.

Yixing has had prosperous humanities throughout the ages, and there is no end to enumerating them in the distant past. Even from the former Qing Dynasty to the present, the Chu family, with their classics, history, and ancient texts, were heavily named in the early Qing Dynasty. There were also many virtuous and good selections among the officials, which was most prosperous during the Kangxi period. Yesterday, I bought a list of Jinshi from the 27th year of Qianlong in the factory city. The first person listed was the Vice Minister of the Clan Mansion, Mr. Chu Meifu of Jingxi (Linzhi, Jinshi of the Jihai year). From Qianlong to Tongguang, there were famous people in every generation. Since the Republic of China, my brother (Nanqiang) has become famous for his political and legal affairs, and is worthy of being the strong man in the South; Wang Kun is a legal expert and a giant in the press, and it is believed that the Chu family is talented. Zhunong once served as the magistrate of Nantong County. After political affairs, he sent his feelings to Fengya, and his other name was "Flower". His family had "Painting Mountain Tower", which was based on the poem "The clear weather in the corner of the house fills the painting mountain", and there was a small building in the west of the city, with Banmeng as the topic "Listening to Water and Listening to Wind Tower". He also wrote a small poem in the middle of the day: "The willow wind rolls the green waves of the stream at night, holding the Qin and the moon is bright, worrying about the cold king, a pair of white seagulls suspect that they are entering the window, sitting and composing the Narcissus music with the curtain." The real situation is like this, I want to see the beauty in it. In the eight years of Japanese chaos, I don't know if this building was spared?

There are many large families, and talents in political and academic circles are emerging in large numbers. Banmeng is Yunshi, and his rank is the most respected. His calligraphy studies Wang Menglou, and he modestly said that his skills are good, so he is called "Banmeng". In the Jiyou year, he was selected as a tribute, and served as a judge for more than ten years. Now he is nearly seventy years old, and he is a resident of Shanghai. Zhiying has been in the northern press for a long time, and Zhucheng has been in the Tianjin Dagong Newspaper, with remarkable achievements. Recently, I received a letter from Yunshi Weng, knowing that he is in Shanghai, waiting for the time to come. I have also heard that there are many outstanding people from Yixing in the Shanghai industry, but the old man is not alone, and he is stuck in the ancient city, unable to meet all the emerging heroes. Twenty years ago, Chunming's old friends, or Ping has "Southern people return to the South", or have died one after another. Only in the newspaper and in the letters of one or two relatives and friends, I learned that my brother Sha Wuzeng (Renxiao Lian, a judicial and legislative writer) is a mainstay of the political party, working hard for the country. At the age of nearly seventy, he is old and strong; my brother Jia Guobo is in the financial world, serving as an official for forty years, and he has a number of characters with experience and learning. The two brothers often travel back and forth to Beijing and Shanghai, and I can imagine their public actions; my brother Yu Jingzhai has entered the economic world from the legal world, and he is also able to handle it with ease, believing that talented people can do everything. Borrowing this extra space, I am familiar with my old friends. An old and desolate man, I don't know when I will see you again, I laugh at myself.

### Legal Consultation and Clarification for Readers: Amidst Housing Shortage, Ordinary People Suffer, Second Landlords Run Rampant, Refusing to Accept Rent

Liu Jiasun Asks: (1) My late father rented a house in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) for a monthly rent of five yuan, paid in advance. No contract was signed at the time. Starting in May of this year, (1) the landlord suddenly refused to accept the rent, claiming that he wanted to take it back for his own use. Is this legal? (2) The second landlord wants to sign a fixed-term relocation contract with me, as well as a contract to exchange houses (from good to bad). Can I refuse? (3) The second landlord refuses to accept the rent. What standard should I use to deposit it with the court, and how should water and electricity costs be calculated? (4) What are the procedures for depositing with the court? Besides the court, where else can I deposit the rent? (5) My family makes a living by washing clothes. If the second landlord refuses to supply tap water, how should we cope? (6) Tap water and electricity all belong to the second landlord. If the second landlord stops supplying electricity, how should we deal with it?

[Legal Advisor Mr. Ming Shi Answers] (1) Taking back for one's own use is permitted by the Land Law, but the lessor must prove the circumstances under which he should take it back (refer to Article 100 of the Land Law). (2) Of course, you cannot be forced to sign. (3) You can deposit the original rent amount. However, if you believe that the original rent amount is indeed unreasonable, you can deposit it according to the 1,400 times the amount negotiated by the city government. Water and electricity costs should also be handled according to the original regulations, or the ratio of the number of rooms, or the amount of consumption. Deposits should be made monthly thereafter. (4) The court has a deposit office with pre-printed forms. Fill them out item by item and submit them. Banks can also be used for deposits, but the lessor's account name must be established at the time of deposit. After the deposit, a written notice must be given. However, its evidentiary power is not as strong as a court deposit. (5) Drinking water is indispensable for human life. In an emergency, you can complain to the nearest police station to force the supply. Electricity is slightly different, and it is even more different when water and electricity are used for professional purposes. In addition to applying to the water and electricity company for installation yourself, you should first confirm the provisions of the lease.
