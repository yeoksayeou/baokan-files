### New Financial Measures Discussed and Decided in Moganshan; President Weng and Finance Minister Wang Return to Nanjing

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] President of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Finance Vice-Minister Xu Boyuan, and Chairman of the US Aid Utilization Committee Yan Jiagan, among others, flew to Hangzhou on the 29th at the President's invitation to visit him on Moganshan. They flew back to Nanjing on the "Ziqiang" special plane at 7 PM on the 30th. When Weng and others left Moganshan on the 30th, they visited the President again at 10 AM for further discussions for about two hours, providing detailed reports and requests for instructions on certain economic and financial measures. After having lunch at the Moganshan Hotel, they went down the mountain at 1:30 PM. They took a short tour of West Lake around 4 PM, visited Lingyin Temple, and then took off from Jianqiao Airport at 6 PM, returning to Nanjing. The issues reported and requested instructions on by President Weng and others were the execution of the national budget, especially how to coordinate with the budget passed by the Legislative Yuan based on the current state of national revenue and expenditure after the Legislative Yuan completed its review of the budget. In addition, Yan Jiagan also gave a report on the use of US aid, and discussed how to properly use it to absorb a large amount of legal tender, and concrete decisions have been made. As for financial controls, it was also decided in principle to continue strengthening implementation to achieve the effect of balancing revenue and expenditure and stabilizing the economy.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] In order to balance revenue and expenditure, stabilize the currency, and effectively execute the national budget, the government has decided to take emergency financial measures in the short term. These measures have become concrete and mature after President Weng and others visited the President on the mountain. When Weng and others returned to Nanjing from the mountain, all the key officials kept the matters decided on the mountain strictly confidential. However, the reporter repeatedly inquired of President Weng at the airport, and Weng admitted that "there will be news in the short term." According to sources from authoritative circles: Under the current objective circumstances, there must be measures taken in finance, the current budget revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, the cost of living index is increasing monthly, the numbers are very large, and the budget passed by the Legislative Yuan is in fact not enough to maintain for too long, and there must be new measures to meet the needs. It is heard that this measure will still start from financial policies in general, and there will be appropriate countermeasures against speculative capital. As for the reform of the currency system, it is currently making a lot of noise, but there must be a preparatory stage, and the government must have sufficient power to control it before it can start. If the preliminary preparations are confident, the reform of the currency system can be carried out.

Also, the reporter asked Finance Minister Wang at the airport: It is rumored that the Moganshan meeting has decided to reform the currency system and will start implementing it immediately. Is this true? Wang repeatedly said, "Not true! Not true!"

Editorial

### Shattering Illusions About the Chinese Communists

Since the Chinese Communists published their "Resolution Agreeing with the Comintern Information Bureau's Criticism of the Yugoslav Communists," it has long been clear to the world whether the Chinese Communists have any concept of the state or any national consciousness. However, the so-called "Third Force" in Peiping and Hong Kong are still spreading rumors of resuming peace talks and the so-called "New Political Consultative Conference." Allied friends are also discussing the Chinese Communists' appeal for relief from the Yellow River disaster issued by the secret radio station of the Chinese Communists in North China, saying either that the Chinese Communists will follow in the footsteps of Yugoslav Marshal Tito or that the Chinese Communists are about to split internally. It seems that Chinese and foreign people have not yet clearly recognized the true face of the Chinese Communists. In order to clarify the public's view, President Weng issued a "Clearly Distinguishing Right from Wrong and Jointly Facing National Crisis" message to the people of the whole country on the 28th. In addition to exposing the Chinese Communists' hideous face of betraying the country, he also encouraged the people of the whole country to jointly face the national crisis with "At this juncture of survival, there is no room for ambiguity or hesitation." Although the full text is tens of thousands of words long, it is simple, clear, and righteous. It is indeed President Weng's most important message since he took office. This is not only valued by the international community, but also unanimously supported by the government and the public.

Some people comment on state affairs, always thinking that the root of the problem for the many troubles lies in the government. It seems that the current social unrest and economic depression are all caused by the suppression of the rebellion. Why can't the government avoid this kind of war to suppress the rebellion? On the contrary, the Chinese Communists' sabotage and harassment are not discussed. It is not known that the great disease of China today lies in "unclear right and wrong, unclear black and white." Taking the nature of the Chinese Communists as an example, everyone knows the characteristics of the Communist Party, which lies not in having communism, but in its class struggle and obeying the command of the Comintern. In the past, a part of the people, especially some Allied friends, held illusions about the nature of the Chinese Communist Party, mistakenly believing that the Chinese Communists also have a concept of the state and a national consciousness, but only advocated land reform. Because of the existence of this illusion, the Chinese Communists were regarded as an ordinary political party. Although our government knew the fallacy of this view, it also had the mentality of being kind to people and was willing to negotiate with them, trying to organize the so-called "Coalition Government." This illusion not only affected the general public at that time, but also lingered for a long time, and was used by the Chinese Communists to cultivate their strength as much as possible and expand their territory as much as possible. Although the government has now realized it, it is too late to regret, raising a tiger to cause trouble and making a big mistake. Anyone who understands the course of the peace talks cannot but admit the mistakes of the illusions at that time. Even the Allied friends who firmly advocated the organization of a coalition government in China at that time, after the coup in Czechoslovakia, were also suddenly enlightened.

We are not afraid of making mistakes, but we are afraid of not waking up. However, some professional politicians know that the Chinese Communists are a branch of the Comintern, and have no national consciousness and no concept of the state. They know that the Chinese Communists are a political party of violent dictatorship, and there is no democracy or freedom to speak of. However, they are still praising "New Democracy." When they occasionally hear the rumors of convening a "New Political Consultative Conference," they are overjoyed and rush to tell each other, thinking that the Chinese Communists will organize a "Coalition Government" with them, and they can get a half-official position. They also heard the Chinese Communists' radio broadcast of the "National Capital" lie, and they vigorously campaigned for the Chinese Communists to the industrial and commercial circles, sending secret signals, thinking that after the Chinese Communists seized power, the industrial and commercial circles could still do business and production as usual. Although these deceptive words are ridiculous and laughable, because the society does not distinguish between right and wrong, and does not distinguish between black and white, there are still quite a few people who are misled and deceived. Now, President Weng's message directly pointed out: "Since the Chinese Communists have agreed to the Comintern's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists for promoting nationalism, they themselves have fundamentally denied nationalism. Since the Chinese Communists have agreed to the Comintern's opposition to the Yugoslav Communists allowing representatives of the petty bourgeoisie, peasants, and workers to represent the whole country instead of the one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party, the "Democratic Coalition Government" they are calling for is fundamentally a smokescreen for their political conspiracy; Since the Chinese Communists have agreed to the Comintern's attack on the Yugoslav Communists for deviating from Marxism-Leninism and allowing private ownership of land and people to freely buy and sell land, the Chinese Communists' propaganda to appease the rich peasants and stabilize the middle peasants is naturally an empty slogan; Since the Chinese Communists have also agreed to the Comintern's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists for making individual economy prevalent throughout the country, the Chinese Communists' claim to protect urban industry and commerce is even more a shameless trick." The true face of the Chinese Communists has been completely exposed in President Weng's writing. The expansion of the Chinese Communists' power today is entirely based on its tricks. However, the tricks of the conjurer can only be joked, and cannot be taken seriously. The trick of "covering the ears and eyes of the world" will eventually be exposed, and this time, it is not President Weng who exposed the Chinese Communists' mask, but the leading figures of the Chinese Communists themselves! Not only those who had illusions about the Chinese Communists in the past now know that they are bubbles, but also the blindly following Chinese Communist members, especially the young people with a little national consciousness and concept of the state, will also be able to wake up and return from the wrong path. If they resolutely reform themselves, the government will be able to especially forgive them and allow them to return to the embrace of the motherland and become democratic and free citizens under the constitutional government.

Shenyang is more energetic than any other city. I used to be the mayor of San Francisco and I am very interested in municipal administration. I hope that 275 million US dollars will be properly distributed to cities with plans, methods, and efficiency between September and April next year.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] Legislator Wang Huayi visited Layman on the 30th and stated his opinions: (1) For US aid to China, North China should be more important than South China, and Northeast China should be more important than North China.

(3) Industry, mining, transportation, and large and small factories in Northeast China should receive relief so that they can start production and reduce unemployment.

(2) Prohibit workers from loading and unloading, and the workers' losses will be compensated by the shipping companies.

The Cause of the Civilian Airline Plane Crash in Qingdao May Be an Oil Tank Explosion

### Director of the Airline Returns to Shanghai from Qingdao for Investigation

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 30th] The cause of the C46 transport plane of the Civilian Aviation Team that crashed and burned at Cang Kou Airport at 5 pm on the 29th has not yet been found. It is estimated that it may be a fire caused by an oil tank explosion. The entire contents of the plane were munitions, so it was immediately burned and could not be rescued. The plane carried 16 officers and soldiers of the 57th Brigade, with a load of 46,140 pounds and 700 gallons of oil in the fuel tank. According to Green, the main driver who had driven the plane, the plane had flown to Jinan three times and had never found any obstacles. Apart from the fuel tank explosion, there was no other reason for the accident.

[Our News] A plane of the Civil Aviation Transport Team crashed and burned in Qingdao the day before yesterday afternoon.

There was no special phenomenon that caused the accident when it took off this time. In addition to the pilot and co-pilot and the radio operator, the plane carried 16 officers and soldiers of a certain unit who were going to Jinan, 700 gallons of gasoline, and military equipment. All the personnel on the plane have now died. The exact cause of the accident is still under investigation.

### We Ask the Allied Headquarters to Extradite Ying Zuo as Soon as Possible

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Legal Affairs Group of the Chinese Mission to Japan here has again asked the Allied Headquarters to extradite Japanese war criminal Ying Zuo Zhenzhao as soon as possible and hand him over to the Chinese government for trial in China. Chief Shang Zhen sent a letter to MacArthur half a month ago, requesting prompt action. Ying Zuo was a well-known Japanese intelligence officer. After Wang Ni Jingwei fled Chongqing during the war, he personally took Wang Ni from Hanoi to Shanghai. The Allied Headquarters' Legal Affairs Bureau is obviously not enthusiastic about China's repeated requests, and is delaying the matter on the grounds that Ying Zuo's health is not good and he is not suitable for foreign travel. Because China's war criminal trial work will end at the end of September this year, the Chinese Legal Affairs Group here is eager to extradite the most important last name on the list of Japanese war criminal suspects to China for trial in time. The person in charge of the group told reporters yesterday: The Chinese government is prepared to send Chinese doctors to Japan to check Ying Zuo's health in order to find out whether he is really as Japanese doctors claim that he is not suitable for travel. China will not let go of Ying Zuo. If it cannot extradite him, the Chinese authorities will organize a separate military commission to try him in Japan.

### The Capital High Court Tries Fraud Case Using Audio Recordings as Evidence

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] It is the first time in our judicial circles that the Capital High Court used open audio recordings as evidence to try a case on the 30th. According to Zhao Qibin and Zhao Qihao brothers, the managers of the Taili Cafe on Zhongshan Road in Beijing, after the victory, they borrowed 5,000 US dollars, 26 pounds, and a 6-carat diamond ring from Lin Shurong, a Fuzhou native. Later, in Shanghai, they only returned the diamond ring after drinking and cheated the representative of Lin to get the IOU. After refusing to admit the loan, Lin sued Zhao and others for fraud in the local court. Because there was no IOU, the local court ruled not guilty. Lin claimed that the loss was worth hundreds of millions, so he filed an appeal and discovered new evidence. Because of the production of audio recordings, the use of audio recordings at the court session on the 30th was of great help to the whole case, and it is expected that the truth will be revealed soon.

### Chen Lifu Visits Marshall Twice in the United States to Discuss Steps for Military Aid to China; Also Meets with Truman to Discuss China Issues

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Washington, 21st Dispatch] Since arriving in the United States, Chen Lifu, Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, has met with General Marshall twice and contacted several key officials of the State Department. People in the American diplomatic circles have a fresh impression of Chen's visit to the United States, recognizing Chen's sincerity in loving his country and his frankness. Yesterday, Chen met with President Truman at the White House the day before his departure for England, and discussed China issues. After leaving, Chen told reporters that he had informed the President that the situation in China was quite serious. The Communists obtained a steady supply from the Northeast. The large-scale arsenal and excellent military supplies left by Japan in Shenyang have been destroyed and seized by the Communists, and their rebellion is expanding daily. Therefore, what China needs now is rapid military assistance. President Truman is very understanding and sympathetic to the China issue and agreed that China needs rapid military assistance.

The content of Chen's two meetings with Secretary of State Marshall is kept secret, but reporters learned from American sources in Washington that Chen had suggested to Secretary Marshall that the China issue was even more serious than the situation in Berlin. He said that there are now more than one million armed Communists in China, and if China turns red, India, Burma, Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries will inevitably be affected. Chen also pointed out that the threat of communism is a global problem, and local solutions can only make the pressure on other parts heavier.

The second meeting between Marshall and Chen lasted 75 minutes. Secretary Marshall analyzed in detail the reasons for the slow progress of American aid to China, mainly due to the complicated legislative procedures in the United States, which cannot be accommodated. According to rumors from relevant sources in Washington, the second meeting between Marshall and Chen involved specific steps for American military aid to China. Ambassador Wellington Koo was also present, and Ambassador Koo repeatedly emphasized "Military aid to China must be rapid." As for financial aid to China and monetary reform, it is believed that Marshall and Chen did not mention it, because some members of the financial aid to China technical team led by Bei Zuyi are still stationed here. Relevant American diplomatic officials also said that Chen Lifu did not discuss any financial aid to China matters with Marshall.

Chen is scheduled to leave the United States for England today. During his stay in the United States, he visited the Los Angeles City Council, the Senate and House of Representatives in Washington, and visited the Democratic and Republican Party Conventions in Philadelphia. He is deeply interested in the current democratic system in the United States.

Bevin Warmly Receives Chen

[Central News Agency, London, 30th] Chen Lifu was warmly received by Bevin at the British Foreign Office yesterday. Chen also met with Attlee, Eden, and other senior British government officials at the banquet of Viscount Portal yesterday afternoon, and is scheduled to visit Mrs. Cripps today.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] Chen Lifu, Deputy Speaker of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, said that China is now fighting against communism, and if Britain fully understands China's intention, not only for its own sake, it will come out to help China. He believes that the whole world will give China assistance. If China fails in this struggle, Malaya will also be lost. China's failure is also Britain's failure, because if Asia is communized, Britain will encounter many dangers.

### Molotov Excuses Himself with Vacation, Three Envoys Blocked from Meeting, Possible Direct Negotiation with Stalin, British Foreign Secretary Announces in House of Commons No Sidestepping Soviet Warning

[This Newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: According to Washington news, the State Department has just received a report from the US Embassy in the Soviet Union stating that just as the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States and France to the Soviet Union were planning to submit a note to Molotov to discuss the Berlin issue, Molotov suddenly announced that he was taking a vacation and refused to meet. It is speculated in diplomatic circles here that the three major governments may therefore negotiate directly with Stalin. However, the State Department did not comment on this refusal, and said that it had not yet formally received a report on this matter.

[This Newspaper] London, 30th Broadcast: The envoys of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France today asked the Soviet Foreign Ministry to meet with Molotov in order to submit the Western countries' resolution on the Berlin issue to the Soviet side. Roberts and French Ambassador Chataigneau had dinner with Smith last night for a half-hour private conversation. Roberts and Smith personally informed Chataigneau of information about the London Conference.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] According to well-informed sources: The procedure agreed upon by the Western Allies for new actions towards Moscow regarding the Berlin issue is for the three envoys to send a memorandum to Molotov, and then request an audience with Stalin to discuss Berlin and general European peace issues. The saying published in American newspapers that the three Western envoys had abandoned their plan to directly meet with Stalin has been deemed inaccurate by well-informed sources.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] The United States, the United Kingdom, and France are using the latest strategy to negotiate with the Soviet Union. After the blockade of Berlin was broken, the State Department on the 29th quietly waited for Moscow's response. It can be inferred that the West decided on this strategy to measure the cost of the Soviet Union lifting the blockade and whether negotiations can be conducted accordingly. Authoritative sources also declared, "The basic policy of the Western countries has not changed much. The purpose of our policy is still to lift the blockade of Berlin."

[United Press, London, 30th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin seized the initiative in the Cold War from other Western countries and placed the choice of war or peace before Stalin. Bevin warned Stalin on the 29th with the strongest and most direct official document since the war that Britain had decided to take steps in two areas. He made it clear that what is happening now depends on Stalin's choice. (1) If the Berlin blockade is not removed, the situation may lead to war. In any case, Britain may stop its demobilization plan and re-examine all its military strength and policies. (2) If the blockade is lifted, Britain will participate in four-power negotiations. Bevin's speech was in fact a British version of the preview of the statements made by the three envoys when they met with Molotov on behalf of the West. Bevin's words clearly show that the West has encountered the worst situation since Munich and has decided to stand firm and not retreat. Western officials are half optimistic and half pessimistic about this new policy.

### Representatives from Ten Countries Gather in Belgrade to Discuss Danube River Navigation, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Presides Over Opening Ceremony, Strict Security Measures

[This Newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: The Danube River Conference was held at 4:00 PM today in the assembly hall of the Kolarac University, presided over by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister.

[United Press, Belgrade, 30th] Since the four foreign ministers' conference broke up unhappily in December last year, the East and West sides met here for the first time today to hold the Danube River Conference. Countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain are trying to create a new Danube River regime to control the river at this conference. Among the relevant European countries, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France all have representatives in attendance. Armed guards patrol back and forth outside the hotels where the representatives are staying, and the signs of sickles and hoes are on shops and public buildings. The Western representatives are US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Cannon, British Ambassador Peake, and French Ambassador Tillet. The focus of all parties is on whether South Korea will still vote with the Soviet Union regardless of the attacks by the Communist Information Bureau. The Western position is as follows: some countries enjoy special privileges in the southern part of the river, which prevents companies from other countries from traveling in the area.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 29th] High-ranking officials from the Soviet Union and South Korea met for the first time today since the Tito dispute.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the Shanghai Local Court suddenly experienced the escape of the notorious bandit Little White Dragon. Despite the efforts of the bailiffs to investigate and apprehend him, he has not yet been caught. It is reported that the robber Zhu Yongfu, also known as Wu Tianxiang (nickname Little White Dragon), on June 18th of this year at midnight, robbed the citizen Lu Shaotang of a gold ring in the Yongqing Lane of Shanhai Pass Road. Afterwards, he was captured by the police, and two revolvers and six bullets were seized. He was transferred to the local inspection office and then to the local court for trial. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, in the local court, Judge Fang Xianghai pronounced the verdict: Zhu Yongfu and Wu Tianxiang were both sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. The pistols and bullets were confiscated, and the gold ring was returned to the victim. After the verdict, the bailiffs returned the two criminals to custody. At that time, all the criminal courts in the local court were in session, and the bailiffs were short-handed. Together with eighteen other defendants, they were escorted by only two bailiffs. Because there were only eight pairs of handcuffs left, each pair of criminals was handcuffed together, forming eight groups in total. The remaining two female criminals were not handcuffed. When the bailiff Yang Lisan handcuffed the bandit Wu, the criminal falsely claimed that his hand hurt, requesting a looser restraint. Yang did not notice at the time and did not handcuff him tightly. When descending the stairs, Yang was in the front, and another bailiff escorted the female criminals at the rear. One of the female criminals had a leg ailment and walked slowly, causing the line of prisoners to be interrupted. Little White Dragon took this opportunity to quietly remove his handcuffs, blended out the gate, and left. When the bailiffs arrived at the detention room for roll call, they discovered that Little White Dragon was missing. They closed the iron gate and conducted a thorough search, checking identification cards for everyone entering and exiting. By 6:00 PM, the entire court was still under tense alert, but he had not yet been found.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, went to Beijing a few days ago to request loans for public utilities and to stabilize fuel prices for public utilities from the Executive Yuan. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning.

President Weng instructed: (1) The government should absolutely maintain the cost of public utility companies. (2) The fuel price required for public utilities should not be changed within one month, and the fuel management agency should discuss technical issues. (3) The loan portion can be discussed with the National Bank.

### Having Suffered Greatly, Love Finally Becomes a Family: Suzhou Double Suicide Attempt, Parents Forgive and Settle the Lawsuit

[Our Newspaper's Report] The lovers Shen Wei (female) and Huang Xi had a close relationship in normal times. In May of this year, they traveled to Suzhou together and indulged in love in a private room. On June 29th, they traveled to Suzhou again. Huang, because his marriage was blocked by the woman's parents, and feeling that his income was not much, making it difficult to afford marriage expenses, impulsively bought sleeping pills and took them with Shen Wei, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, the medicine taken was fake, and the effect was mild. They were discovered and sent to the hospital for treatment, and both were saved. Afterwards, Shen Wei's father reported Huang Xitang to the police for rape and abetment to suicide, and transferred him to the local inspection office for investigation. However, Shen Wei testified in court that she and Huang had always been in love, and the police report was her parents' intention. Both families had also reconciled, hoping to make a good thing happen. The complainant then applied to withdraw the lawsuit. The local inspection office considered that the case was a private prosecution according to law, and since the complainant had applied to withdraw the lawsuit, it should be exempted from discussion and a decision not to prosecute was made.

### Distribution Ratio of Fishery Relief Materials Agreed Upon, Two-Thirds of Timber Sold to the Ministry of Communications

[Our Newspaper's Report] The meeting on the distribution of fishery relief materials for seven coastal provinces and four cities concluded as scheduled yesterday after three days of discussion, with representatives from various regions arguing for their own interests. The focus of the dispute during the meeting was, firstly, the percentage of material distribution. Representatives from each region hoped to obtain a larger distribution figure. Secondly, the issue of selling the timber portion of the materials to the Ministry of Communications. Representatives from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces opposed the sale to the Ministry of Communications, while those from other regions who supported it had different opinions on the price and quantity. After heated discussions on these two issues, it was decided that the distribution ratio would be as follows: Guangdong would receive 25%, Zhejiang would receive 20%, Fujian would receive 12%, Taiwan would receive 10%, Jiangsu would receive 11%, Hebei would receive 11%, and Shandong would receive 11%. As for the timber portion, it was decided that two-thirds would be sold to the Ministry of Communications at a price of US$1.25 per foot, converted to national currency at the actual price. The proceeds would also be distributed according to the above ratio. Each region should organize a regional fishery material processing committee within one month by the relevant agencies in each region to handle these relief materials. A regional material distribution meeting should be convened, limited to one year to complete the handling. If there are special reasons, an extension of six months can be requested. If it still cannot be completed after the deadline, the disaster relief committee will take it back for further processing. The allocated fishery relief materials include fishing gear, engines, shipbuilding hand tools, hardware, boat mooring equipment, navigation instruments, paint, net accessories, rigging, coir rope, steel cable, timber, etc., with an estimated total value of about five to six million US dollars.

### Evicting Tenants, Assembling a Crowd to Commit Assault: Ophthalmologist Has Foot Broken and is Severely Injured

Zhang Xijun, director of the second branch of Guanghua Eye Hospital at 808 Jiangning Road, a famous ophthalmologist, was seriously injured around 11:00 PM on the 29th when the landlord Wang Weide led four or five thugs and broke into his bedroom while he was sleeping to assault him, resulting in a broken ankle. This created an unprecedented incident of a landlord injuring a tenant in the city. It is reported that Zhang rented two houses at that address in 1937 to open a hospital. Recently, the landlord Wang Weide repeatedly forced him to move out. Zhang, because of the severe housing shortage in Shanghai, had nowhere to move, so he repeatedly invited neighbors to mediate. Unexpectedly, the landlord resorted to force. At about 10:00 PM the night before last, while Zhang was alone in the bedroom, Wang Weide led four or five thugs into the room and assaulted Zhang. Zhang cried for help but found no way to escape. He fled wounded to the balcony along the road. Wang and the thugs also rushed to the balcony, wielding wooden sticks and chair legs, and beat him severely, threatening to kill Zhang. In desperation, Zhang jumped off the balcony railing and fell onto the road, breaking both ankles and unable to move. At this time, a "906" pedicab came. Zhang asked the driver, surnamed Song, for help. Song hugged Zhang onto the pedicab and headed south, preparing to report the case to the Jiangning Road Police Station. Unexpectedly, Wang and the others caught up on the road, chased back the pedicab, and beat the already severely injured Zhang again, tearing the pedicab driver's clothes. Fortunately, nearby police officers arrived, and Zhang's life was saved, but both feet were broken, and the injuries were severe. After questioning by the Jiangning Road Police Station, the case will be transferred to the Local Inspectorate.

### Nine Hundred Pawnshops Face Collapse Crisis: Value of Pledged Items Soars, Market Interest Rates High, Difficult Capital Turnover Faces Serious Blow

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the recent months of sharp inflation, various legitimate industries have suffered greatly, and the pawnshop industry, which is closely related to the lives of the poor, is facing a collapse crisis due to heavy pressure. Following the closure of most pawnshops in Jiaxing, Changshu, and other places, the business of the 900 pawnshops in the city is also in a state of stagnation. This business, with a history of more than 2,000 years, which once maintained the stability of rural society through lending, is now desolate. On the dim, dark counter, the "shop assistant" is drowsy, and the scene is extremely bleak.

The biggest difficulties currently faced by the pawnshop industry are the rapid changes in the value of pledged items and the high black market interest rates. For example, at the beginning of last month, a pawnshop took in a coat. According to the current value of 70 to 80 million yuan, it should pay a pawn fee of 7 to 8 million yuan. However, when the pledger redeemed it at the beginning of this month, the current value of the coat had soared to 300 to 400 million yuan, so there was no need to redeem it. In the "ticket transfer" once, the pawnshop must deduct the original pawn fee and five-cent monthly interest, and then make up for the pledger about 30 million yuan. The so-called "ticket transfer" means that the pledger redeems the item according to the regulations, pays the original pawn fee and monthly interest, and then repawns it. However, in one turnaround, because the black market interest paid by the pawnshop is often higher than the interest it receives, each "transfer" means that the pawnshop suffers more losses and increases the difficulty of capital utilization.

While sitting and eating capital, waiting for bankruptcy, at the same time, because the price of clothing and other items is increasing day by day, the stalls around the pawnshop that specialize in buying pawn tickets are doing a thriving business. They buy pawn tickets from pledgers who are unable to redeem them, and then redeem them from the pawnshop for resale. Therefore, the "no goods" (pledged items that exceed the redemption deadline), which became the final source of funds for the pawnshop, disappeared invisibly. Before the war, "no goods" could account for 30% of the total number each month, but now it is almost zero, which is a fatal blow to the pawnshops.

Before the development of banking and securities businesses, the pawnshop industry had always been the safest and most reliable investment destination in the eyes of the public for decades. In recent months, the black market interest rate has been as high as 90 cents, while the deposit interest rate of the pawnshop industry is less than 30 cents. Therefore, funds are reluctant to move forward. The pawnshops, which are exhausted and in urgent need of turnover, have been hit by this blow, and they are even more at risk. At present, the pawnshops can only find ways to negotiate loans with relatives and friends to cope with the daily small transactions of less than several million yuan. Most of them are sitting and eating capital, waiting for bankruptcy. According to the industry statistics, before the war, the "family capital" (that is, the funds) of each pawnshop was usually around tens of thousands of yuan, and at least 40,000 yuan. Hefei Zhabei pawnshop giant Dingfeng Pawnshop had "family capital" of 120,000 yuan before the war, equivalent to more than 12 large gold bars at that time. In the past two years, it has suffered repeated losses and has been unable to recover. As of now, the calculated "family capital" is only more than 300 million yuan, equivalent to less than one tael of gold.

The National Bank Loan Has Not Been Realized The current stipulated 50 cents monthly interest of the pawnshop industry includes 4 cents for warehouse rent and 10 cents for handling fees. The actual interest is only 36 cents. Therefore, the era when the industry was regarded by citizens as a "black-hearted transaction" has long passed. It is reported that the authorities are also dissatisfied with this 36 cents monthly interest and have ordered it to be reduced to benefit the poor. They have also promised to provide loans from the National Bank to help the industry tide over the difficulties, but this matter has not yet been realized. The industry association said that in this situation of not knowing whether to laugh or cry, it will first apply to the authorities to slightly increase the interest rate according to the "shortage and dismantling" ratio of the silver and money industry, and then adjust it dynamically at any time, so that on the one hand, it can continue to barely maintain business, and on the other hand, it can slightly pull the capital, so that the foundation will not be broken beyond repair.

Labor and Management Alike Are Groaning In Pain Currently, 50% of the industry has posted red notices of "stopping pawn and waiting for redemption" at the door. "Stopping pawn and waiting for redemption" means closing the store for liquidation. Another 30% are already in the liquidation stage, but they are unwilling to publicly post announcements. It is said that this is to save the "face" of the decades-old store and to prevent depositors who supply funds from coming to demand debts upon hearing the news. There were nearly 3,000 employees in the industry in the city, including more than ten positions such as shop assistant, head counter, second counter, clothing and luggage room, and jewelry room, with clear divisions. In the past, they were well-paid and looked down on all industries. Especially the position of shop assistant was stern and cold in the eyes of the poor, and had unlimited power. Now, due to the exhaustion of business, layoffs are being implemented. Those who leave their jobs cannot change careers because all they have learned is specialized technology. The capital provider of the industry once lamented that before the war, one pawnshop was worth ten cigarette and paper shops. At present, ten pawnshops are not as well-stocked and prosperous as one cigarette and paper shop. The labor side of the industry sighed: Before the war, we were the saviors, even the "gods of wealth," in the eyes of the poor, but now the monthly salary is less than 10 million, not even as good as a pedicab driver! The changes in the world are reminiscent of the luxury and prosperity of the pawnshop industry around 1934, and the feelings of the past and present are overwhelming.

### Hunan Province, Wugang·Xinning: Grain Shortage Leads to Bloody Incident, County Magistrate Shoots Starving People, Township Head Assaults Town Head, Both Places Enter Strike

[Our Changsha dispatch of the 28th] Due to the severe famine in Xinning, several hundred starving people went to the county government on the evening of the 26th to petition for relief, leading to disturbances. The county magistrate ordered the opening of fire, resulting in a tragic incident, with six people injured, four of whom are critically wounded. The entire county's industry and commerce are now on strike, and the Party, the Senate, and various sectors have telegraphed the provincial government and the provincial assembly, requesting a thorough investigation.

[Another dispatch] Wugang has recently experienced a rice shortage, causing widespread panic. A few days ago, in the evening, dozens of rice merchants were carrying rice through the East Gate's Jade Coin Bridge when they were stopped by starving people. The town office, upon hearing the news, sent police to suppress the situation. Amidst the disturbances, Liu, the township head of Shuanglong Township, also arrived with several armed soldiers, claiming that the rice was purchased by his township. Mistaking the town police for those obstructing the rice, he detained them and sent them to the county government for detention. The next morning, Luo, the town head of the town office, went to the county government to inquire. Liu, the township head, was present, and the two sides disagreed. Liu then used his cane to beat Luo. After the incident, the townspeople, upon hearing the news, felt indignant and gathered to petition the county government to punish the perpetrator and investigate Liu's whereabouts. Liu, sensing danger, took refuge in the Self-Defense Force headquarters, which was then surrounded by the crowd. Liu hid on the second floor and, taking advantage of his elevated position, ordered his guards to open fire, killing one person and seriously injuring another. As the situation escalated, the petitioning crowd demanded that the county magistrate arrest and punish the murderer. County Magistrate Chang detained Liu in the county government but made no statement on how he would be punished. The crowd, believing that the county magistrate was intentionally protecting him, became agitated again and stormed into the county government. The guards, unable to stop them, opened fire, killing another person. Wugang is now in a state of strike. The county government is under temporary martial law, with machine guns set up in front of the office, as if facing a major enemy, and the situation has not eased.

### Desolate Scenes in Changli, Most Shops Closed, Transactions in Silver Dollars, Han Wenzheng's Shrine Rented to Poor Tenants

[Our Qinhuangdao dispatch of the 30th] This reporter recently visited Changli, Hebei, a model county in eastern Hebei known for its rich cultural relics. Although it has been recovered for a month, entry and exit inspections are extremely strict. There are few pedestrians in the city, and most shops are closed. The county government is operating in a dilapidated official residence. The provincial women's normal school and the county high school have both suffered disasters. Several elementary schools have had much of their equipment destroyed by artillery fire. Elementary and middle school students who are unable to return home are attending summer training classes. The only problem for the autumn semester is repairing school buildings and making desks and chairs. The local armed forces are repairing the city walls and fortifications. The mountainous areas a dozen miles away are mostly occupied by bandits, making the situation quite complex. Currently, the shops and melon markets between the South Gate and the railway station are doing brisk business, but most prices are negotiated in silver dollars. Changli was a major economic pillar of eastern Hebei in the past, as many wealthy merchants operated large businesses in the Northeast. However, most of them have now gone bankrupt. The coastal fishing areas are also in the hands of bandits, making Changli even poorer. Han Wenzheng's public shrine has also been rented to poor tenants, creating a desolate scene. The only sign of prosperity is the abundance of melons and fruits, which are cheap and of good quality.

### Severe Floods in Xiangbin Lake, Hundreds of Miles of Land Inundated in Changde·Hanshou Area, Representatives of Affected Counties Petition Provincial Government

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 29th] The secondary flood in Xiangbin Lake has been devastating. According to Mr. Tao, Director of the Dongting Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, who witnessed the disaster, for hundreds of miles from Changde to Hanshou, not a single piece of land can be seen. It's as if one is in the middle of the ocean. The largest Ren'an Embankment in Hanshou has collapsed on both ends. He saw more than twenty families of flood victims in the Black Mountain Temple, all living in water towers, looking emaciated and miserable. When asked why they didn't seek refuge elsewhere, they replied that they didn't have the strength to escape and couldn't bear to abandon their meager belongings, willing to live and die with their homes. From Yuanjiang to Caowei, there is a large embankment, only two inches above the water. All the farmers, men, women, and children, are guarding the dike day and night, not resting for a moment. Yuanjiang City is submerged more than ten feet deep. Not a single intact house can be seen in Caowei, only the rooftops and willow branches. Inside the non-breached dikes, farmers are rescuing half-soaked and half-cooked new grains in the floodwaters. The water level in Nanxian County is more than two feet higher than in the 34th year of the Republic. Twenty dikes have collapsed, and the houses, tools, and livestock of the disaster victims have all been lost to the waves. In Chenxiang and Yin City, boats are sailing on land, and all commercial activity has stopped. Driven by poverty, many people have committed suicide by hanging themselves. The delegation of representatives from the affected counties has contacted each other in the province and jointly petitioned the provincial government, requesting (1) emergency relief, (2) cessation of conscription, and (3) cessation of military draft.

### Merchants Participating in Trade with Japan Must Follow Prescribed Procedures

[Our dispatch] Merchants engaging in trade with Japan must not engage in commercial activities without special government permission. Japan is still under Allied control, and the exchange rate is not yet fixed, making the situation special. Therefore, the government specifically formulated and promulgated the "Essential Points for Merchants' Trade with Japan" last year, so that our merchants can conduct limited barter trade with Japan under the overall planning of the government. To date, many merchants have participated, but there is a lack of clarity about the procedures. Inquiries with relevant authorities yielded the following answers:

(A) Cash Trade: Any merchant who intends to export domestic products to Japan, except for the goods listed in Annex (5) of the current import and export trade regulations and the goods prohibited for export by the Export Control Commission's public notice, may export them to Japan according to the general export regulations, provided that they can sell the foreign exchange from the export to a designated bank. However, the import of goods from Japan to China is generally prohibited, except for barter trade.

(B) Barter Trade: (1) Any merchant who wants to participate in barter trade with Japan should first apply to the local Chamber of Commerce and be recommended by the Chamber of Commerce to the Trade Guidance Committee for Trade with Japan of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The committee will review the applicant's qualifications. Then, the merchant will formulate a trade plan based on the "Range of Import and Export Goods for Trade with Japan in 1948" approved by the Executive Yuan and submit it to the Guidance Committee for approval. Then, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue a passport to Japan. (2) The purchase and sale contract negotiated between the merchant and the Japanese side should be sent to the commercial commissioner of our mission in Japan to be negotiated with the organization representing the Japanese side. Three copies should be prepared separately and sent by the commercial commissioner to the China Trust Bureau, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Export Control Commission. (3) When the merchant performs the purchase and sale contract, he should apply to the commercial commissioner of our mission in Japan for a certificate of import and export goods. The merchant will then use the original to apply to the Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission or its district office for an import and export license. (4) Any qualified merchant who intends to export goods from our country to Japan must first fill out five copies of the "Certificate of Purchase and Sale of Export or Re-export Foreign Exchange to Designated Bank" and the certificate of export goods issued by the above-mentioned commercial commissioner, and submit them to the Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission or its district office for verification and stamping, and affix the stamp of barter trade with Japan and customs clearance. The merchant will then report to customs for inspection and release. At the same time, the merchant must send the following documents to the China Trust Bureau with a letter for registration of the export price. 1. Pricing and transaction documents (listing the name, quantity, unit price, and total price of the goods exported to Japan) 2. A copy of the customs declaration, invoice, insurance policy, and bill of lading. (All bills of lading should specify that the China Trust Bureau should forward them to the consignee). (5) Any qualified merchant who intends to import goods from Japan to China, or when the Japanese side delivers the goods, should also send the following documents to the commercial commissioner of our mission in Japan for verification and issuance of an import certificate. 1. Pricing and transaction documents (listing the name, quantity, unit price, and total price of the goods imported into China). 2. A certificate from the China Trust Bureau stating the amount of the merchant's account balance or a letter proving that the merchant's guarantee has been received.

The merchant should also fill out seven copies of the "Application for a License" and submit them along with the import certificate issued by the above-mentioned commercial commissioner and relevant documents to the person in charge of the Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission for signing or to the district office of the commission for verification and stamping, and affix the stamp of barter trade with Japan before handing them over to the merchant for customs declaration and release.

### External Stimulation Intensifies, Chinese Stocks Stir Buying Sentiment

Chinese stocks were strongly stimulated yesterday by external factors, and credit was so abundant that buying sentiment was stirred reluctantly. However, both industry insiders and outsiders engaged in arbitrage, moving east to compensate for the west, and the buying appetite of the Guangdong faction was only described as steady.

The opening in the morning was mediocre. Yongsha debuted at a low price of 11,400 yuan. Numbers 3 and 135 were sold to 11,380 yuan, and Numbers 76 and 226 immediately entered, rising to 12,250 yuan. Numbers 107 and 145 were sold, retreating to 12,050 yuan. After that, market sentiment was still good, but small stocks and miscellaneous stocks were abnormally weak, and the situation was uncertain. Finally, the yarn and cloth industries rose again, and credit became so abundant that it could not be increased. Numbers 83 and 135 rose to a high price of 12,700 yuan, and Liandi, Rongfeng, and Hengfeng announced that they would stop rising. Numbers 137 and 173 rose and then fell, and Numbers 216, 172, and 207 were sold, closing at 12,550 yuan at noon. Compared with the previous close, in addition to the rise of Liandi, Rongfeng, and Hengfeng, Yongsha, Xinguang, Meilin, Xinhe, Huayan, Qinyu, Xinhua, Business Unity, Jinglun, Matches, and China Silk rose by half a percentage point. Jingfu National Goods, Meiya, Lianan, Zhabei, and Yonggong Underwear rose by one percentage point. Huaxin and China Cement were flat, and the rest rose slightly.

The afternoon market continued the momentum of the morning market. Yongsha exceeded the daily limit as soon as the market opened, rising by a maximum of 450. Numbers 69 and 151 all closed, but retreated to 12,600 yuan. It was initially rumored that there was a difference in the exchange rate, and it exceeded the limit many times. Finally, the state bank advanced a little, and although the rise from outside the industry was strong, the market closed with Numbers 205 and 145 selling to 12,600 yuan. Meiya and others stopped rising, and all reported a small decline. It was rumored that the President was coming to Shanghai, and the market sentiment suddenly weakened. Compared with the morning close, in addition to Meilin, Rongfeng, and Liandi's rise limit, Yongsha, Meiya, Xinhe, and Yonggong rose and then fell after the rise limit. Gain and loss were both seen in the exchange. Hengfeng fell by one percentage point, Jinglun by a small percentage point, Huafeng, Lianan, and Matches were still flat, and the rest of the stocks rose and fell slightly. In the off-market, unlisted stocks saw a half-percentage-point increase in public utility stocks and China Wuzhou, while the rest were stable.

Government Bonds

More than 2 million was traded yesterday. Liubing opened in the morning at 920,000, rose from 910,000, and closed at 1.03 million. Compared with the previous close, A and B rose by 100,000 yuan, C rose by 130,000 yuan, D rose by 110,000 yuan, and E rose by 120,000 yuan.

### Import Licenses

Starting in August, the National Bank Will Handle the Issuance, and Collect a Handling Fee of 0.1%

Regarding import licenses, the Export Control Commission previously set up a visa office to handle it. Currently, the visa office has been abolished, and the import licenses issued by the Export Control Commission will be signed by the director of the committee. A visa office will be established to handle the matter. The issuing matters have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to entrust the Central Bank to handle them, which will be implemented starting on August 1. All import licenses will be signed by the director of the visa office from the same date, and it has been approved that a handling fee of 0.1% will be charged separately, except for special regulations. In the future, for goods approved for import by the Export Control Commission, a handling fee must be paid to the Central Bank before the visa can be issued for exchange settlement and import.

### Price Index Savings

The National Bank and the Ministry of Finance are in Discussions

It is learned that in order to resolve the current economic crisis, the government is planning price index savings to absorb legal tender and maintain the people's purchasing power. The Central Bank is discussing this plan with the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance believes that there are too many technical problems, so the realization of this matter may be delayed. Price index savings mean that people deposit legal tender based on the price index on the date of deposit, and when they withdraw the money, it is calculated based on the price index on the date of withdrawal, so as to avoid losses due to currency depreciation due to rising prices. After implementation, the amount of goods that savers can purchase when they recover their savings in the future will be the same as when they deposited legal tender. Because savings are based on the price index, everyone's surplus funds no longer need to be used to hoard materials or purchase gold, as is the case today, which can stabilize prices. In the current situation, this is the only way to contract the currency and maintain purchasing power, which has attracted attention from all parties, and everyone hopes to see it implemented soon.

### Exchange Rate for Publicly Operated Enterprises Calculated at 60%

[Our dispatch] The Operations Bureau of the National Bank recently issued a notice to all branches that in the future, the exchange rate for remittances from state-run and public-run enterprises and institutions will be handled in accordance with the industry standard, and a 60% fee will be charged.

### Method for Paying Principal and Interest on Short-Term Treasury Bills Due Today Determined

The China and Jiaotong Banks, which sold 37-year short-term treasury bills on the securities exchange market, convened a meeting yesterday by the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank with the organizers of the China and Jiaotong Banks to discuss the payment of principal and interest on treasury bills due on July 31. Those sold by the banks themselves will be redeemed by the banks. Those who hold treasury bills with the hard seal of the China or Jiaotong Banks should go directly to the banks to redeem them. If there are no treasury bills with the hard seal of the China or Jiaotong Banks, they can be redeemed at the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank. Those who subscribed at the Hongkou Branch of the National Treasury Bureau should also go to the branch for redemption.

### Rare Tea Exports

The export of green tea, such as Zhenmei, which mainly sells well in Africa, is currently being inquired about by customers in that region, but the prices offered are still quite harsh. However, tea merchants here feel that the production price is rising repeatedly, and various domestic teas have recently seen good sales in the street and rural areas, and buyers are willing to search for them at good prices, which has frequently stimulated the market, so it is not easy to cope with overseas inquiries for a while, and they have temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the foreign tea market is still unusually deserted, and the situation is firm in the quiet.

### Silver Market Loosens, Confidence Rises: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Increase Across the Board

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw the money supply further ease and cotton cloth prices sharply rise. Moreover, with the partial opening of self-provided foreign exchange, the Hong Kong exchange rate continuously decreased, leading to an increase in Hong Kong yarn prices. Merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions continuously sought to purchase, boosting market confidence significantly.

Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately surged by 100 million upon opening. Market sentiment was strengthened by higher asking prices, creating a sharp increase in activity. Although Shenxin and Wing On factories opened for business, market prices continued to rise aggressively, ending the day at 2.16 billion, a sharp increase of 310 million from the previous day. Tomorrow's selling price is expected to rise to 2.2 billion, another increase of 320 million from the previous day. Twenty-one count Double Horse also rose by 270 million. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose uniformly by about 100 to 200 million.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw prices rise due to an insufficient supply of raw cotton and reports of factories reducing production. Dyeing factories expected that the end-of-month index might increase by 20-30%. Amidst rumors of easy money, market confidence began to tighten. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, due to many periods without sales from the Spinning and Weaving Company, faced a dry market inventory. Various parties aggressively sought to purchase, and prices jumped by 400,000 upon opening. Subsequently, with frantic purchasing from Northern merchants and dyeing factories, prices rose directly to 57 million at closing, a further sharp increase of 3.4 million from the previous day, showing signs that supply was still insufficient to meet demand. Consequently, prices in the after-hours market rose to 58-59 million, with orders still being placed. Other drills, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and various colored cloths and shirting fabrics all increased sharply again.

Another report: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiti vessel exported this morning, carrying 1,500 tons of yarn and cloth to Hong Kong, over 300 tons to Shougu, over 300 tons of general merchandise to Singapore and Yangon, and 1,700 pieces of fresh goods to Hong Kong.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, concerned that the dumping of Japanese cloth in Southeast Asia was severely impacting the export of domestic products, telegraphed the Yarn Control Committee to formulate countermeasures. It has now been learned that the committee has drafted a proposal and submitted it to the ministry for approval. The proposal plans to purchase 450,000 bales of Indian cotton and 150,000 bales of American cotton within the 37th fiscal year, with 20% of the finished products being exported to counter the dumping of Japanese goods. Furthermore, the Yarn Control Committee and the Export Committee will jointly form a Southeast Asia inspection team with national and private manufacturers, with the aim of actively promoting exports as a countermeasure against the dumping of Japanese yarn and cloth.

### Silk Industry Established, Silk Market Opens

The silk industry, in order to meet needs, yesterday began the establishment of a silk market for the trading of silk fabrics. The police have dispatched personnel to monitor transactions in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to engage in other illegal transactions and price gouging.

### Woolen Fabric Prices Remain Firm

Woolen fabrics, due to various facts and environmental factors, have standard prices that are consistently difficult to lower. At most, there are only temporary periods of sharp increases followed by small corrections. The circulation of goods in the market is less than during periods of stable prices. Yesterday, there were few formal transactions in woolen fabrics, and prices were firm, with actual sales declining. Small-factory products and large-factory-finished miscellaneous woolen fabrics are still sold on the tea party market, as their prices are cheaper and highly suitable for consumers in various regions.

### Bank Clearinghouse Transfers Worsen

Yesterday's bill exchange at the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury totaled 114.8 billion yuan. The Central Bank accounted for 6.546 billion yuan in outflows, the Bank of China accounted for 6.171 billion yuan in inflows, the Bank of Communications accounted for 11.579 billion yuan in inflows, the Farmers Bank accounted for 6.323 billion yuan in inflows, the China Trust Bureau accounted for 5.847 billion yuan in inflows, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau accounted for 1.384 billion yuan in inflows, and the Central Cooperative Bank accounted for 1.610 billion yuan in outflows. Foreign banks accounted for 4.685 billion yuan in inflows, and provincial and municipal banks and commercial firms together accounted for 5.833 billion yuan in outflows.

### Commercial Conditions in Various Regions

Wuxi [Our Newspaper's Wuxi Dispatch, 30th] Today's commodity prices were initially weak but then strengthened, repeating the end-of-month price surge. White geng rice: 34.94 million yuan; White yuan rice: 34.34 million yuan; Yangxian rice: 34.74 million yuan; Geng rice paddy: 15.15 million yuan; Wheat: 28 million yuan; White wheat: 30.8 million yuan; Flour: 11.8 million yuan; Soybean oil: 83.2 million yuan; Cotton yarn: 1.5 billion yuan.

Chengdu [Our Newspaper's Chengdu Dispatch, 30th] Silver supply in Chengdu is gradually easing, and commodity prices are rising. On the 30th, gold, silver, cloth, yarn, and general merchandise prices all increased. New grain has entered the market, and rice prices in various regions are generally stable.

Chongqing [Our Newspaper's Chongqing Dispatch, 30th] The currency shortage can be temporarily resolved. 800 billion in cash will be transported from Shanghai to Chongqing by special plane on the 30th.

### Rice Prices Firm as Harvest Approaches: New Pudong Rice Transactions Gradually Increase

The rice market initially fell and then rose, ultimately showing a slight increase. Early trading saw a decline of 2 million yuan due to sluggish outbound transportation, causing the price drop. However, the price decrease in mid-market trading stimulated demand, resulting in a slight rebound. Northern market white geng rice was priced at 37 million yuan, and high-quality geng rice was priced at 39 million yuan. Southern market thin rice was priced at 38 million yuan. Transactions in new Pudong rice gradually increased, with prices ranging from 35 million to 37 million yuan across three grades. All rice prices were firmer at the close, remaining roughly the same as the previous day. Yesterday's total arrivals in the northern and southern markets amounted to 5,316 piculs.

Flour initially weakened but then strengthened, ultimately stabilizing. Opening prices were very low, but gradual sales began midway, leading to a slow rebound. Old-brand flour rose from 12 million to 12.6 million yuan, slightly up by 200,000 yuan from the previous day. Battleship brand flour closed at 11.65 million yuan, and the market showed signs of stabilization. Red Bee, Jiancheng, and miscellaneous brands of flour showed slight weakness, while bran increased by 200,000-300,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains showed mixed trends. Soybeans increased by 1 million yuan due to limited inventory and active purchasing from merchants. Broad beans experienced sluggish sales, and there were few transactions for Gou rice and green beans, with little price fluctuation in the market. Yuan wheat and red sorghum each added 500,000 yuan, weakening at the close. Sesame seeds and raw kernels, under the purchasing activity of merchants, each rose by 2-3 million yuan.

Edible Oils gradually increased. With soybean prices rising, sellers maintained prices, and factories also insisted on higher prices. Moreover, the return of warehouse receipts was also scarce, leading to higher prices. Soybean oil initially opened at 79 million yuan, gradually rising to 81 million yuan at the close, up by 4 million yuan from the previous day. Rapeseed oil also rose by 4 million yuan, crude oil rose by 7 million yuan, a Ji barrel of crude oil was traded for 107 million yuan, and a small cart of sesame oil broke the 100 million mark, a sharp increase of 10 million yuan. Soybean cakes initially remained stable but then strengthened, with narrow fluctuations and minimal price changes.

Our Basketball Team Changes Strategy

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] This morning, sports figures stated that if the Chinese basketball team could perform as they did in their practice match against their fellow team last week and put on a brilliant show, the Chinese basketball team would have a 50% or higher chance of entering the second half of the World Games basketball tournament. The other two Far Eastern basketball teams, the Philippines and South Korea, are believed to be China's toughest opponents in the fight for a spot in the second round. Also in this same group are the teams from Iraq, Chile, and Belgium. This afternoon, on the 28th, the Chinese team performed strongly in two ten-minute practice games against Hungary and Switzerland, winning 25-20 and 20-10 respectively. The Chinese basketball team arrived here a week ago, and the performances of its team members have been excellent. Chinese basketball players have abandoned their one-on-one defensive tactics and adopted a new zone defense strategy, in which they surround the opponent's key players in the center of the zone and force them out of the ball area. This change in zone defense strategy has been quite successful in previous practice games. However, the Chinese basketball team's reserve team performed weaker.

### British Standard Young Athlete John Mark Runs the Last Leg of the Torch Relay

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The "mysterious person" who carried the torch into Wembley Stadium and lit the flame during the final leg of the World Games torch relay was John Mark, a 22-year-old medical student at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, standing at six feet two inches tall, and a handsome young man. He was selected by the World Games Executive Committee as the representative of British youth athletes. This matter was kept secret until Mark appeared at Wembley Stadium. It is said that Mark is one of the best all-around athletes in the country. He served as the captain of the Cambridge sports team while he was studying at the university.

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] Today was one of the hottest days in London in seventeen years. The torch relay runners, departing from various counties in southern England, went to Wembley to participate in today's World Games opening ceremony. The 72 British runners responsible for completing the final journey of the torch relay received great attention from the British people. Spectators stood by the roadside all night, causing traffic jams, and some followed the relay team by car and bicycle, causing the police to have to clear the road for the torchbearers. The roadside audience included people of all ages and nationalities, and some were wearing pajamas, young people wearing bathrobes, and old women in wheelchairs being pushed two miles to watch the torch relay. Last night, when the British Navy destroyer HMS Bicester (which carried the torch across the English Channel) handed the torch to the first British relay runner in Dover, 50,000 people attended the ceremony. The relay runners were instructed to slow down because their speed exceeded the scheduled time, so that they could arrive at Wembley just in time for the opening ceremony.

School Introduction

### Peiping Railway College

— Zheng

As you walk past the southern entrance of Fuyou Street, or past Li Gelao Hutong, you will find a tall school gate, which is the National Peiping Railway Management College.

Its predecessor was Beijing Jiaotong University, abbreviated as Jiaoda Pingyuan, which, together with Shanghai Jiaotong University (abbreviated as Jiaoda Huxiao) and Tangshan Jiaotong University (abbreviated as Jiaoda Tangyuan), were like three brothers, sharing the same lineage. It is just that they have recently separated and become independent.

Currently, the school is divided into four departments: Transportation, Materials, Finance, and Business Management, with a total of more than 400 students. The professors hired are mostly well-known domestic experts or veterans in the transportation industry, all of whom are deeply learned and virtuous. In terms of curriculum, both theory and practice are emphasized. In the first year, in addition to the Ministry-designated Chinese, English, Economics, Physics, Calculus, and Engineering Books, there are also Principles of Accounting and Principles of Economics, which are different from ordinary schools. In the second year, in addition to the publicly required courses, the Finance Department focuses on Advanced Economics, Advanced Accounting, Public Finance, Public and Private Finance, Business Administration, Money and Banking, etc. The Transportation Department focuses on Passenger Transportation, Freight Transportation, etc. In the third and fourth years, the main courses are Freight Car Allocation, Freight Rates, Railway Operation, Railway Accounting, Vehicle Construction, and Road Engineering.

In terms of equipment, in addition to a library of considerable size, which is sufficient for students to engage in pragmatic and truthful exploration and research, there are also small-scale tracks, locomotives, bridges and culverts, signals, and station equipment, so that students can engage in theoretical exploration on the one hand, and practical exercises on the other. Because there are not many students, the student dormitories are very spacious, and large rooms usually accommodate only two or three people. Therefore, they often say: "Among the universities in Peiping, we can say that the problem of accommodation is the most comfortable."

In order to train middle-level railway cadres, in addition to the university section, there is also a secondary technical department attached to it in Wangfucang Hutong, Xicheng, which is divided into three classes: Railway Operations, Telecommunications, and Business, graduating in three years. Their courses are largely the same as those in the university section, so although it is stipulated that junior high school graduates can apply, there are many high school students among them. However, the secondary technical department does not recruit female students, which is a bit of a pity!

The new student entrance examination was originally scheduled for mid-July, but due to problems in the old examination hall, it has been delayed until mid-August. This year's enrollment is only in the Shanghai and Peiping areas. The Shanghai area will be at the National Shanghai Business College, with registration dates on August 9th, 10th, and 11th.

One of the great advantages of this school is that there is no problem with students' future careers. All of this year's graduates have been employed, and some even have several positions to choose from.

Young friends, if you are willing to dedicate yourselves to transportation and work hard for the construction of a new China, please prepare well!

### World Games Opening Ceremony Our Delegation Shines Rong Qizhao and Song Jun Lead Huang Tianxi Holds the Flag

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The 14th World Games held its opening ceremony at Wembley Stadium on the afternoon of the 29th. Our country's 44 delegates, dressed in blue tops and white trousers and full of spirit, were greeted with cheers by 80,000 spectators as they marched around the stadium and passed in front of the British Royal Box. Rong Qizhao, leader of our delegation's mountain football team, and Song Junfu, coach of the basketball team, led the way, entering the venue from the eastern underground passage. Huang Tianxi, our basketball team's guard, tall and strong, standing six feet three inches tall, held our national flag. All our delegates followed in two rows. After our delegation entered the stadium, they were listed as the 14th team, according to alphabetical order. The American team had the largest number of athletes, with a total of 400 people. The smallest was the Singapore team with one person. After the magnificent procession of all athletes circled the stadium, our Secretary-General Dong Shouyi entered the venue together with other members of the World Games Committee and stood in front of the Royal Box. The weather was extremely hot today, and more than a dozen spectators fainted. However, members of British society still dressed up to attend, with men in tuxedos and women in long skirts. Any major British event is a social occasion, and the presence of the King and Queen of England gives the World Games a very high status in social terms.

Opening Ceremony Photo

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] The opening ceremony of the 14th World Games was held this afternoon. Wembley Stadium was magnificent and solemn. The wide red runway and the flat, tender green grass field were surrounded by colorful national flags of various countries. At the beginning of the opening ceremony, the Guards in red uniforms and bearskin hats appeared at the entrance of the underground tunnel, followed by the King's Guards in gold uniforms and purple hats, and then the Scottish pipe band. After the members of the International Olympic Committee in top hats took their seats, officials Attlee, Eden, foreign envoys from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Chile, Queen Mary, various royal families, the Mountbatten couple, and UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, etc., entered the arena to the sound of military music. When King George and his family arrived at the arena, the entire venue immediately fell silent and stood up. The military band played the British national anthem. While the King received the members of the Olympic Committee, the Queen and Princess Margaret stepped into the royal box. The athletes' parade immediately began, led by Greek athletes, with athletes from each country led by their national flags. The athletes wore lantern trousers and sports shirts and hats of various colors. The athletes' teams from each country lowered their flags to salute as they passed in front of the throne. The representatives of Australia and the Philippines even took off their hats to salute. The cheering and applause were incessant. The athletes' parade lasted for forty minutes, with the British team at the end. After the inspection, the athletes from each country lined up facing the King of England. King George solemnly declared through a loudspeaker: "I declare the 14th World Games of the modern era in 1948 open." A thousand white pigeons circled over the stadium and then flew to various places, spreading the news of the opening of the Games. Then, a 21-gun salute was fired. British athlete John Mark arrived at the stadium with the Olympic torch in the last burst of the salute, circled the stadium, and then used the fire to light the Olympic flame on the left side of the stadium. After the prayer of the Bishop of Newchurch, British World Games athlete Finley swore on behalf of all athletes: "For the glory of the country and sports, we must show loyalty in sports." The opening ceremony of the World Games was completed in the sound of the British national anthem sung by the entire audience. The audience filed out of the stadium, and the athletes from each country returned to their camps to prepare for the battle tomorrow. Following Romania and Bulgaria's withdrawal from the World Games, a total of 59 countries are currently participating in the Games.

### Superfluous "Appeasing"

— Jingwen

I believe that apart from the followers of asceticism, ordinary people probably do not oppose improving the enjoyment of human life. The ultimate goal of culture and civilization is nothing more than improving and raising the living standards of mankind. Therefore, although our living conditions are far from comfortable, for all social improvement measures that are beneficial to a comfortable life, even if I am not fortunate enough to enjoy them, I always express my support as an observer. Even if it is nearly extravagant behavior, as long as it is reasonable, I am willing to be optimistic about its success.

For example, take travel. In today's world of widespread fire and ubiquitous disasters, to be harsh, travel should be considered an almost luxurious affair. However, I absolutely do not take that view, and believe that even in this chaotic world, as long as one's personal strength allows it, and there is no guilt in one's conscience, then an occasional weekend trip is not too much to criticize. Moreover, the vicissitudes of life are unpredictable, and human life is limited. Timely enjoyment also has a kind of spiritual need. A person who has "copper coins" and is willing to "use two cents" on relatively meaningful enjoyment can be considered to understand the principles of being human.

Since travel is a kind of enjoyment, all facilities related to travel should be meticulously researched, striving to make travelers happy to spend money without complaint. Conversely, the organizations that operate travel businesses should, of course, aim to make money. Only then can it be called a fair transaction. Many countries in Europe regard operating travel businesses as a major source of foreign exchange income. For example, the Queen Elizabeth, the luxurious ship launched by Britain after the war, aims to serve wealthy American tourists in exchange for US dollars. Therefore, not only is the interior decoration of the ship luxurious, but the extravagance of its food supply even aroused the question of the British Parliament. Because at present, the entire British people are dominated by a rationing system, if there is one more egg on the Sunday breakfast table, it is considered an amazing enjoyment. However, on that luxurious ship dedicated to the enjoyment of wealthy American tourists, not to mention that eggs and butter are all available, but also venison! However, the reply from the British government authorities is that if Britain wants to earn foreign exchange, it has to tighten its own belt first.

China's current situation is naturally not comparable to that of Britain, because although they are tightening their belts, they have also implemented the National Social Insurance Law from cradle to grave. If I were also British, not to mention tightening my belt without a word of complaint, even if I were to starve to death, I would be willing, because being born in a country that has hope, personal sacrifice is a valuable contribution.

I've digressed, let's talk about travel again. This reminds me of the so-called "air-conditioned trains" (which are said to have now been renamed "express trains") that the two railway authorities have recently been vigorously promoting. In China's transportation industry, apart from the postal service, which has become universally praised, the railway industry cannot be denied its considerable achievements, especially the railway repair teams in the war zones, whose spirit and ability have won praise from both China and foreign countries. Even in the case of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, at least judging from the achievements they have promoted in the past two or three years, they have made progress.

But this time's "air-conditioned train", I still think is a superfluous "appeasing". Air-conditioned trains, American "Pullman" cars probably already have them. However, America is America. America's universal production capacity has turned some waste into a necessary consumption. For example, we are eating rationed sugar, while they, men, women, old and young, each have a "Wrigley's Spearmint". If Americans don't waste some more, it's bound to be a "sin".

However, we are ultimately different. Using the class of train to compare our national economy with that of the United States, we are good enough to be able to squeeze into the third or fourth class of the "international train". What we need today is not some air-conditioned train, but to open a few more window holes on the fourth-class car, and add a cover to the tarp car. Even if we say that our current technical ability is sufficient to build air-conditioned trains (according to the results of the trial, this is still a problem), it is actually unnecessary, because the train, when it is running, is already cool enough with the windows open. Now, to deliberately close the windows and use air-conditioning, isn't that close to waste - and unreasonable waste?

Taking a step back, even if we admit that air-conditioned trains have their needs, this need is of course for a few special people, and for the sake of the interests of state-owned enterprises, they should logically raise their prices to a reasonable level. However, it is said that the current highest fare is only worth about one US dollar. This amount is naturally large enough in the eyes of ordinary people, but you must know that many materials in the transportation industry are purchased with the country's foreign exchange. Foreigners have repeatedly criticized China for state-owned enterprises operated with foreign exchange materials, which not only fail to make money for the government, but instead cause the government to lose money. It is said that the fare for a sleeper car from Shanghai to Nanjing, a distance of 180 miles, is only equivalent to 80 US cents. For example, taking a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Shanghai to Hong Kong costs about 16 US dollars, while taking the same plane back to Shanghai from Hong Kong, calculated in Hong Kong dollars, costs about 70 US dollars. This shows that the British are indeed much smarter than us.

The purpose of this article is not to advocate high prices, but for things that are not "for the public to sit on" and that need to be maintained by foreign exchange, it is believed that it is necessary to seek a reasonable pricing. Otherwise, it is too much to plan for the rich. The price limit policy for cinemas should also be applied to certain state-owned enterprises.

### Diary Literature

— Qian Dacheng

The earliest diary is probably Huang Shangu's "Family Record"? According to Lu Fangweng's "Notes from the Old Study Hut", "Huang Luzhi has a diary, called the Family Record, and he did not stop writing it even in Yizhou." Other books, such as Fan Chengda's "Record of the Wu Boat" and Lu Fangweng's "Record of Entering Shu", all use the style of a diary to record events. But the official name of diary, I am afraid, is Guo Tianxi's "Diary of a Guest in Hangzhou" in the Yuan Dynasty. Later, some people changed the name to "Daily Record", such as Zhu Zuwen's "Northern Journey Daily Record" in the Ming Dynasty. Some people also call it "Daily Register".

By the late Qing Dynasty, diaries were very popular, and politicians, scholars, and writers all had diaries, some of which lasted for decades without interruption. The most famous, of course, is Zeng Wenzheng Gong's diary, Wang Renqiu's "Xiangqilou Diary", Li Ci's "Yue Mantang Diary", Ye Changchi's "Green Du Lu Diary Notes", Weng Tonghe's diary, Zhao Liewen's fifty-four-volume "Neng Jing Ju Diary", which contains a lot of historical data on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but unfortunately it was not printed and was sold by his son. Yuan Shikai and Duan Qirui both had diaries. Last year, I met Ms. Yi Zhi, the daughter of Duan Lao (she is Yuan Shikai's niece-in-law) in Suzhou. She mentioned it and agreed to lend it to me for reading. "Yue Mantang Diary" was hidden by Fan Fanshan for several volumes and is no longer complete. The manuscript has also been bought by a gentleman from Zhejiang Xingye Bank. "Green Du Lu Diary Notes" had already deleted many trivial matters and scolding parts, leaving only the discussion of editions, inscriptions, and the description of exams and officialdom. Describing trivial matters and scolding people is the most able to show the author's true character, buying the casket and returning the pearl, it is really a pity. Fortunately, the original manuscript was donated to the Suzhou Provincial Gang Library last year, and the true face of Mount Lu is not difficult to re-examine. Other books, such as Yu Dafu's "Nine Kinds of Diaries", Xu Zhimo's "Love Eyebrow Small Notes", Zheng Zhenduo's "Seeking Books Daily Record",... are all very interesting, or have academic value. Tao Menghe's proofread and printed Hua Xuelan's "Xin Chou Diary" records the actual situation of the Qing Dynasty exams in great detail. The examiners demanded illegal fees from local officials, and actually regarded them as regular income, carefully calculating them without shame; the examiners borrowed money to take office, and when they returned, they had hundreds of pieces of luggage, and others also regarded it as natural and did not find it strange. This kind of real situation can never be seen in official articles. The value of diaries lies in this. I have also been keeping a diary for many years. Occasionally, when I read it, the shadows of the past are like a past life. When I see the prices recorded in the diary a few years ago, compared with the prices this year, I feel that the previous days were really too good, but now I can still get through it. Those who come after will look at today as today looks at the past. So I am not pessimistic about the future. Reading the diaries of the ancients does not mean that I miss the "Prosperous Era of Qianlong and Jiaqing"; because the people of the "Prosperous Era of Qianlong and Jiaqing" were also worried about wind, rain, rice, and salt in their diaries.

### Talking About Aphorisms

— Ji Mo

There are some readers who like to read "aphorisms", so some writers do not hesitate to work hard and specialize in writing aphorisms as their skill. If a text is plain or empty from beginning to end, the reader will not be interested. I think that in this hot summer weather, it would be strange if that writer did not doze off halfway through writing.

It is said that the American publishing industry pays great attention to business sense. Especially some detective and supernatural books are full of aphorisms to attract readers. I have read a lot of this kind of books. Here, because I am writing at a friend's desk, I cannot cite the original book. I will try to imitate the general meaning and come up with a few examples.

This type of sentence is often inserted at the beginning of each chapter, making people love to hold it in their hands and reluctant to let go. For example, in a detective novel, we can read the following similar words:

"In a dark alley, there is a shadow wriggling."

"A letter without a signature was found on the round table in the dance hall. I don't know who sent it."

"The tall Carl was stabbed in the back with a dagger and fell down."

"John was drafting a letter at his desk. He suddenly looked up and saw a pale and dangerous woman standing in front of the table."

Naturally, aphorisms can also be arranged at the end of an article, leaving people with endless aftertaste after reading. No matter what the work, if the author writes well at the end, it is easier to make readers never forget it. For example, Maugham's short story in Life Events, after narrating the adventurous experiences of a wealthy son in Monte Carlo, said that a person does not need to be talented, as long as he is lucky. Sometimes I look at many people who are not appreciated for their talents, and I sigh. Also, the Chinese proverb says, "A fool has a fool's luck." I feel that Maugham's words have some meaning. But it is too unreliable to entrust everything in life to luck.

### Queen of Ties

— Mao Yi

More than ten years ago, a stage actress came to Hollywood, the city of movies, but every studio closed its doors to her. Her silver screen dream shattered, and in extreme boredom, she remembered a woman she met on her travels who made a living selling ties. Why not imitate her? So, she hired a female worker who tailored ties of various colors and began selling her products in Los Angeles and Hollywood.

The business was unexpectedly good, and the first batch of products quickly sold out. At the same time, she discovered that entering the studio as a tie merchant was an extremely easy thing. With her cleverness, talent, and excellent products, directors, actors, screenwriters, and all kinds of film workers became her patrons. Now, people in the city of movies affectionately call her the "Queen of Ties."

This "queen," who specializes in men's business, is Miss Belle Green. She has almost become the city of movies' special clothing staff, because most of the actors' ties are bought from her. She knows which patterns the big stars like, and she tells them which tie to wear with which clothes.

Don't underestimate a tie, it has also caused a stir in the city of movies! When Irving Beecher was an actor, once, while he was filming, his father-in-law came to see him. Irving was wearing a black and white striped tie from Miss Green, and his father-in-law loved it at first sight. In order to please him, Irving immediately gave it to him after the scene was filmed. The old man happily wore the new tie home to show off. Unfortunately, at this time, the company suddenly felt that there was something unsatisfactory during the test screening and ordered Irving to reshoot a segment. But the tie was gone! Even more unfortunately, Green was away at the time, and the same tie could not be found anywhere!

During the reshoot, Irving almost covered his throat with his hands so as not to expose the difference in the ties. Since then, the film company has formulated a rule: all clothing must be kept for three months after the film is finished - if Miss Green had become a "Movie Queen" instead of a "Tie Queen," she probably would not have such authority!

### Swindling the Gods

— Kuan Nai

Stephen Weinberg, an American from Brooklyn, can be rightly called the "King of Swindlers" of the United States. In the thirty years from 1913 to 1943, this person used twenty-five different aliases and committed countless acts of trickery. His attitude was extremely calm, his behavior was very natural, and no one would have thought that he was a swindler. He repeatedly impersonated senior officials of the U.S. government to invite prominent figures from foreign countries to travel to the U.S., taking the opportunity to profit from them. In 1921, he even brought Princess Fatima of Afghanistan to the United States in the name of the U.S. government. After the princess arrived with a large number of attendants, the swindler went to swindle the U.S. government, and he actually achieved the goal of holding a banquet at the White House. Not only that, President Harding actually attended the banquet in person, and the swindler actually introduced the Afghan princess to President Harding in person. It was not until many years later that someone became suspicious and finally discovered that he was originally a swindler.

### More Delicate Than Hair

— Yanbo

The most meticulous craftsman in the world today is James W. Zaharee, who lives in North Dakota, USA. Recently, with the help of a microscope, he used a steel pen with an extremely sharp tip to write the full text of President Lincoln's famous speech delivered at Gettysburg on a hair less than three inches long. The speech contains 270 words, totaling 1,175 letters.

The impact of paper money being "large" once, then again "large," on the general public is naturally felt first in Shanghai, the economic and nerve center with its advantageous location. As for the "dignified model" of the new currency, the admiration in Tianjin and Beijing is slightly delayed. However, with the arrival of a telegram, the continuous fluctuations in the market situation seem to concede little. This matter certainly has a significant stimulating effect, but once, twice, thrice, like medicine, one stimulation after another, the feeling transforms from acute pain to numbness. The previous time, the sudden "large" leap from ten thousand to one hundred thousand caused the citizens' expressions to change from worried frowns to bitter smiles. This time, the "large" jump is even more drastic (ten to five hundred), but observing the "market appearance," one finds even fewer bitter smiles; there is no reaction, no expression. Some who do mention it say to each other, "Whatever they say, goes!" It is as if we have returned to ancient times, where "people did not know, did not understand, they followed the rules of the Emperor." Mencius spoke of "the people of a true king, so content and satisfied!" How prosperous is this age!

In Beijing dialect, those who buy goods for personal use are called "users," and using funds to buy goods is called "buying." If merchants buy goods to resell for profit, it is called "grabbing." If someone buys from a fellow merchant and then resells, it is called "inter-trade trading." The method of bargaining involves "sign language," with both parties shaking hands in their sleeves or covering them with cloth, using the size of their fingers to represent the amounts they are asking for or offering. Since the purpose of "grabbing goods" is to resell them, they do not want others to know the original purchase price, so that when they resell, whether at a large profit or a loss, they will not be criticized. The locations for "grabbing goods" are mostly the "small markets" in each city. The source of goods for the small vendors in the small markets is often from "drum beaters" (who specialize in going to each household to buy goods, carrying large baskets on their shoulders and shaking small drums), or directly from households, or they buy from small markets in one place and sell in small markets in another. This situation has been around for a long time. However, since the Japanese invaders launched their war, the situation has been turbulent, inflation has gradually increased, and life has become abnormal, and those who "grab" and those who "run" are increasingly busy and numerous, symbolizing the chaos of the entire economic situation. (No "capital," no "movement"; the larger the paper money, the more vigorous the swimming. No "gang," no "running"; no "goods," no "grabbing.")

Just like in normal times in various public markets and small markets, one only sees "grabbers" (merchants), "drum beaters," and buyers (users), but now, middle-class ladies and young ladies (and there are also older and younger gentlemen, but some hold current positions, or are past officials and gentry, afraid of embarrassment), often sell their own clothes. Moreover, some have joined in "grabbing goods," reselling for profit to supplement their household expenses. The steps of reselling are becoming increasingly hurried, getting them early, selling them quickly. Making money, quickly buying goods; having goods in hand, quickly exchanging them for money. This is the so-called "flipping back and forth," living in the midst of it. Paper money cannot be saved, nor can it be lent at interest, so one can only "grab" and "run."

### Minor Illness

— Zheng Wuchang

Sometimes rain, sometimes sun, sometimes warm, sometimes cold, clumsy in caring for myself, difficult to live. As old age descends, I face great changes, in the season of plums and yellowing, my bones naturally ache.

Ill in bed, I truly imagine Mt. Li, difficult to transfer its spirit onto my pillow. It's not that the master is greedy for a high bed, but tell the person in the hall to bring paints.

### Returning from Dengwei Mountain

— Deng Chushou

Year after year, painting groves on paper, exploring the wonders of the Five Sacred Mountains, year after year. Dengwei's plum blossoms are hundreds of miles away, but today I turn and see my home mountain.
