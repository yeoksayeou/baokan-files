### President Flies to Inspect Yü-tung Battlefield; Grand Victory with Preliminary Success of Chinese Army; Over 20,000 Enemy Casualties in Four Days

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The grand battle in the Yü-tung Yellow River Flood Area is in full swing. President Chiang specially took the Meiling airplane at noon on the 2nd to inspect the battlefield above Sui County and Qi County, and then returned to Nanjing by the same plane.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] After the President flew over the Yü-tung battlefield at noon on the 2nd to inspect, morale was greatly boosted.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] Liu Zhi and Du Yuming returned to Xuzhou from Zhengzhou by special plane at 2:00 AM on the 2nd. On the way, they flew over the Yü-tung battlefields to supervise the fighting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to an urgent telegram sent by a military news agency reporter from the Yü-tung front line at 11:00 AM on the 2nd: The grand battle of Yü-tung, which lasted for four consecutive days, had resulted in the first round of victory for the National Army by the morning of the 1st. The bandits gathered the main force of Chen's 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns and the Liangguang Rapid Column in the narrow area between Sui and Qi, and Liu's 1st and 11th Columns also participated in the battle for the core positions, a total of seven columns concentrated in a counterattack. The bandits initially intended to use elite troops and the old tactic of "using the large to eat the small" to attack certain divisions of the National Army. As a result, they were subjected to the mobile strikes of the National Army and defeated individually. In addition, with the proper coordination of the army and air force, the right-wing positions of the bandits' main force of more than seven columns were broken through on the line of Ruanzhuang and Diqiudian. The powerful National Army that entered Ruanzhuang (10 kilometers east of Tiefosi) continued to encircle and fiercely attack the bandits in Diqiudian (northeast of Sui County) after defeating the bandits in the area west of Ruanzhuang. In the bloody battle that lasted until 9:00 PM on the 1st, only more than 200 bandit cavalry broke through and fled to the northwest, and the remaining more than 2,000 people were completely annihilated. Another National Army unit launched a fierce artillery attack on the bandits on the 1st, advancing vigorously from Taolinggang east of Qi County. A part of the unit recovered the main positions of Zhaizi (southwest of Yuxiangpu) and Peilindian on the evening of the 1st and joined forces with friendly forces advancing from east to west. In total, the bandits' casualties in the past four days have exceeded 20,000, while the National Army has only suffered 5,000 to 6,000 casualties. This is indeed an important victory for the National Army in the Yü-tung grand battle.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The Yü-tung Yellow River Flood Area annihilation battle has reached five days and nights, and the bandit army is making a last-ditch struggle. This afternoon, the National Army's outer line troops rushed from the east and west to coordinate with the inner line defenders to launch a fierce pincer attack on the bandits, vying for several important strongholds. Both sides engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat, repeatedly charging and killing. This vast plain of the Yellow River Flood Area is now completely shrouded in unprecedentedly fierce artillery fire and soaring yellow sand. The air force's Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Bohai Sea unit aircraft groups hovered in the sky all day long to assist in the battle, and the army-air force coordination reached the most ideal level. This afternoon, the National Army's large group of troops on the periphery successively captured strongholds such as Wanglaoji and Zhaolou (northeast of Sui County), Taolinggang and Xugang (southeast of Qi County), and continued to expand the results of the battle.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The unprecedented Yü-tung Yellow River Flood Area main force grand battle is continuing. Chen and Liu's bandit troops have obviously turned into a state of decline. A few days ago, they transferred the 2nd and 3rd police brigades of the Jilu-Yu Military Region, which were originally stationed in southwestern Shandong, to cross the railway west of Minquan and sneak into southwestern Sui County to participate in the battle. The National Army is opening its pocket, hoping to annihilate them in one fell swoop.

### Jinan National Army Advances on Two Routes; Recovers Pingyin and Wand; Fierce Battle Breaks Out Again in Yanzhou; National Army Firmly Defends Four Passes

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The National Army, advancing from Jinan on two routes, recovered Pingyin on one route on the 1st, and recaptured Wand on the other. From the 2nd, the former has advanced to the vicinity of Dong'a, and the latter has also crossed Pijiadian and advanced to the vicinity of Jieshou. The Jinpu Railway repair team, which accompanied the southward advance, has also extended the repair to Wand and is currently continuing the repair south with the army. Also, the main force of the bandit Bohai Column 11th Division is reportedly currently entrenched in Ningjiabu west of Zhangqiu, and a part is entrenched in Xinjiazhuang east of Zhangqiu. At the same time, the bandit New 7th Division, in order to obstruct the National Army's pursuit troops, has recently continued to sneak back from Qingyangdian west of Zouping to Junqiu. The National Army is continuing to suppress and eliminate them.

[Another Telegram] Recently, the bandits in central Shandong are requisitioning a large amount of timber from the people, attempting to extend the Jiaoji Railway, which originally ran from Fangzi via Weixian to Tanjiafang, to Zhoucun.

[Central News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The fierce battle at the four passes of Yanzhou has intensified since one day and night. After repeated attacks were frustrated, the bandits specially gathered the remnants of their New 8th, 9th, 7th, and 13th Columns to launch a fierce attack on the four passes, especially the South Pass, where the fighting was unprecedentedly fierce. The bandits and our troops repeatedly charged and killed, reaching more than ten times in one night. The National Army defended firmly by relying on the dangerous terrain, and the bandits suffered heavy casualties, with corpses lying everywhere. As of 2:00 PM on the 2nd, the National Army was still firmly defending the four passes and fighting fiercely with the bandits.

### Zhang Zhizhong Speaks

Northwest Headquarters Changed to Government Office; Elaborates that the Northwest Does Not Need to Worry About Bandit Troubles

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 1st] After returning to Lanzhou from Shaanxi, Zhang Zhizhong met with reporters for the first time on the 1st. When reporters asked about the issue of changing the Northwest Headquarters, he said: When he was in Shaanxi, the President had personally instructed that it be changed to the Northwest Military and Political Government Office, still governing the four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, but no decision had yet been made. Zhang elaborated on the point that the Northwest does not need to worry about bandit troubles. He said: The bandit troops in northern Shaanxi and southern Shanxi, after their replenishment is completed in three months, will amount to no more than ten columns. Now, even if we generously estimate that the bandits can launch eight columns to invade the west, the National Army also has strong troops to repel them. Moreover, if the bandits really have these eight columns, they will definitely covet Central China and attempt to cross the Yangtze River, and will not come to the Northwest to try to do the impossible.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Sino-US bilateral agreement on the use of US aid will be formally signed and announced at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:15 PM on the 3rd. At the same time, our government will issue a statement for this purpose. President Chiang has already issued an order on the 1st to appoint Foreign Minister Wang Shijie as the plenipotentiary representative of our country, and the US representative is Ambassador Stuart. According to reliable sources: the agreement is valid for a period of fifteen months, and will take effect from the date of signing. There is no provision in the agreement that our country must grant Japan and South Korea most-favored-nation treatment in trade. Other than that, it is largely the same as the bilateral agreements between European countries receiving US aid and the United States. According to the agreement, certain technical details for the use of US aid must be stipulated in separate contracts or appropriate measures must be taken by our administrative authorities, which are all being discussed between China and the United States and will be decided one after another. As for the "China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee," a separate agreement will be made.

Key Points of the Agreement

In the preamble to the bilateral agreement, the purpose and spirit of the United States' aid to China this time are cited, and it is explained that China and the United States have concluded the agreement in accordance with the aid to China bill passed by the US Congress and resolved to be accepted by the Chinese Legislative Yuan. The key points of its provisions are: (1) The US government's measures for aid to China and their termination are all based on laws enacted by Congress. The Chinese government will do its best to complete its self-help and reconstruction plan, and promises to cooperate with the United States to use part of the proceeds from the sale of aid materials to improve foreign exchange and private trade. (2) The Chinese government will earnestly implement its self-help plan, make full and effective use of its resources and manpower, US aid, and the property of Chinese people in the United States to increase production, and take necessary measures to stabilize finance and promote trade. (3) China and the United States should consult with each other when necessary, so that the US government can guarantee that its citizens' investments in plans approved by the Chinese government can be converted into US dollars. (4) The Chinese government should deposit an equivalent amount of legal tender when accepting grant-type US aid. This amount will be used for the administrative expenses of the American aid to China implementing agencies in China, inland transportation costs of relief supplies, and other purposes agreed upon by both China and the United States, including the development of China's production capacity, the development and production of raw materials needed by the United States, the repayment of national debt, and other plans to curb inflation. (5) The Chinese government agrees to conclude contracts with the United States so that the United States can obtain an increased supply of raw materials it needs. (6) The Chinese government agrees to cooperate to facilitate American transportation to China. China and the United States will also negotiate tax-free import measures for all relief supplies donated by the US government and private individuals. (7) The Chinese government agrees to supply the US government with sufficient reports on the formulation and implementation of its reconstruction plan. When one of the two countries, China and the United States, raises any questions arising from the agreement, both parties shall consult to resolve them. (8) The US government may send special delegations to China to implement the provisions of the agreement and inspect the implementation of the aid plan. The Chinese government will grant general diplomatic immunity to US staff. (9) Disputes between the Chinese government and US citizens arising from its measures will be adjudicated by the International Court of Justice or an arbitration court formed by mutual agreement. (10) The agreement is valid for fifteen months. If one of the two countries, China and the United States, believes that there has been a fundamental change in the provisions of the agreement, such as the aid ending before the scheduled date, the two parties will consult to decide whether the agreement will be amended or terminated early. If no agreement can be reached, either party may give six months' notice to the other party to terminate it. (11) US aid materials and legal tender deposits that remain to be used after the termination of the agreement shall be handled by agreement between China and the United States, while other contracts concluded under the agreement shall remain valid for their own stipulated periods and shall not be affected.

### Control Yuan Adjourns

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Control Yuan has decided to temporarily adjourn from the afternoon of the 2nd. After the various regulations of the Control Yuan have completed the legislative procedures by the Legislative Yuan, it will then formulate various rules and regulations based on them and continue to hold meetings. The adjournment time is uncertain, but during the adjournment period, the exercise of the power of consent will not be restricted. The president may convene a meeting temporarily to exercise the power of consent. It is heard that the list of grand justices and examination commissioners nominated by the President will be sent to the Control Yuan soon, so the adjournment time may not be too long. The decision of the Control Yuan to adjourn was passed at the sixteenth meeting held on the morning of the 2nd. Yu Youren presided over the sixteenth meeting. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the secretariat read out the minutes of the fifteenth meeting, and then submitted a temporary emergency motion from Guo Changhe and 55 others, stating: "The issue of the right to propose various bills of this Yuan is extremely important and closely related to the exercise of power and promotion of supervisory tasks of this Yuan. Colleagues believe that it is necessary to seek a solution quickly through legal and reasonable channels, and propose that the plenary session of this Yuan decide to request the President to convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuans in accordance with Article 44 of the Constitution to determine a solution; during this period, the plenary session of this Yuan will be temporarily adjourned." In addition to the explanation by Guo Changhe, the commissioners had many opinions on the adjournment, and the speeches were enthusiastic and unresolved for a long time. The commissioners' opinions against the adjournment were that the reason for the adjournment proposed in the case was inappropriate and seemed to be coercing the Legislative Yuan. Liang Shangdong then proposed a revised opinion stating: "Before the various regulations of this Yuan have completed the legislative procedures by the Legislative Yuan, the general regulations of this Yuan cannot be formulated, and it is proposed to temporarily adjourn?" When it was put to a vote, most people agreed and it was passed. The meeting adjourned at half past twelve.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Most of the Control Yuan members believe that it is necessary to review the past work of the Control Yuan, and are brewing a motion: "It is proposed to establish a special committee to review the cases of impeachment and discipline submitted by this Yuan in previous sessions, promote their thorough implementation, fully exert the effectiveness of supervision, rectify officialdom, and revitalize the hearts of the people." The case is currently being signed and will be submitted for discussion after the resumption of the meeting.

### President Chiang to Convene National Revolutionary Committee Reform Meeting This Month; All Current Party Systems to Be Abolished

[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] A certain Kuomintang figure told the United Press on the 2nd that President Chiang is expected to convene a meeting of party members from the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans this month to "completely reorganize" the Kuomintang. The details will be decided by the party members' meeting. A major feature of the reform plan is the abolition of all current party systems, including the Central Executive Committee, the Central Supervisory Committee, the Central Political Committee, and their affiliated agencies. Another feature is the implementation of a general registration of party members. The date and location of the meeting have not been decided, with Guling being the most suitable location, but there is also the possibility of holding the meeting in Nanjing. It is expected that the date will be after the Legislative Yuan's adjournment on July 20, or after major issues such as the budget, price control new plan, and the appointment of grand justices and examination committee members are resolved. The figure believes that the reform meeting will be an outbreak of years of accumulated party factional conflicts, after which the Kuomintang can appear as a new party. The figure stated that after the current organization is dissolved, a committee will be established to take over the powers of the Central Executive Committee. It is said that President Chiang, who is believed to be leading the reorganization, will decide the form of the reorganized party by majority vote and does not intend to personally support any faction. As a result of the reorganization, various factions will regroup, and "new people" will be responsible for important matters. The figure stated that this reorganization will likely be the "most drastic" since the reform presided over by Sun Yat-sen in the 13th year of the Republic.

### Editorial: Suppressing Prices and Thoroughly Investigating Price Hikes

The price hikes in June were truly frantic. The stormy waves have left the common people breathless. Now that the end of June has just passed, everyone is anxiously awaiting the opening of the July market today, hoping that there will be no more alarming jumps. The municipal authorities and military and police leaders of this city held an emergency meeting all day yesterday to discuss this matter, and the president of the Central Bank will also rush back to Shanghai today to take precautions. Whether the vigorous price suppression movement can achieve considerable results depends on whether the government and the good people can work together and whether those who implement government orders can be clean and selfless. Most importantly, the government must take a leading role in the price stabilization movement.

The new government under the constitution began its administration in June. The Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, witnessing the soaring prices in various places, have risen up to denounce it. The members entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the people must, of course, make some kind of statement. It is said that the Legislative Yuan will invite Premier Weng to attend a meeting and report, and the Control Yuan will send people to thoroughly investigate the reasons. In fact, the soaring prices are a reality, which the administrative authorities cannot deny. The soaring prices have their reasons, which everyone probably understands. The result of the thorough investigation will be no more than this and that. What remedy will there be for the prices themselves, and what benefits will there be for the people? The committee members, living in seclusion, always believe that the soaring prices are nothing more than the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants and the mischief of wealthy families. As long as the evidence is conclusive, killing one will be enough to warn a hundred. If it were really that simple, the world economy would not be panicking, and our China's various problems would have been solved long ago.

There are two types of price increases: one is a moderate increase, and the other is a frantic increase. From the perspective of economic principles, when the monthly interest rate of short-term treasury bills issued by the central bank is as high as 24%, and when the government adopts a high-interest policy, with general market interest rates at 30% or 40%, a moderate increase is naturally unavoidable. Because whether it is agriculture, industry, or commerce, everyone seeks profit. With such high interest rates, plus various expenses and legitimate profits, it is not surprising that prices rise every month in proportion to the interest rate. Unless the government adopts a low-interest policy, this trend will not change. However, the frantic increase, which goes beyond the norm, seems to be orchestrated by someone behind the scenes, ready to emerge. Contemporary commentators attribute it to military defeats, the overabundance of floating capital, the publication of the deficit, and so on. These all have their reasons, but none of them seem to scratch the itch. Military defeats did not start today, and floating capital has been overabundant day by day with the currency, and the size of the deficit has long been understood by everyone. But prices did not rise frantically then, while prices in June have increased more than ever. Isn't it because someone is stirring up trouble behind the scenes? So, what is the force behind the price hikes? Let's look at some factual analyses.

The necessities of life are nothing more than food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Although the government has not openly declared control over the general economy, it is implementing a seemingly partial control. Major cities are now implementing rice rationing. Although each person's ration is only 15 catties, it is better than no ration at all. However, why does the price of rice still follow the black market and adjust accordingly? Of course, the authorities are suffering in silence. With American rice in check, they insist that they are not allowed to sell it at a low price. Even though the municipal authorities of this city unilaterally decided that the price of rice for July rationing should be 10 million, which is more than half the market price, it is still twice as high as the price of rice for June rationing! The price of rice is the leader of all prices. The common people are not very worried about other things, but the price of rice is a huge threat. The central authorities seem to regard such an important matter as insignificant. They have not made a full effort to deal with it, nor do they have the魄力 to take responsibility for preventing it from rising with the black market. Since the government cannot stabilize the price of rice, how can it talk about stabilizing other prices? In fact, the government has plenty of rice, from the requisitioning of actual grain and American aid. The quantity should not be small. As long as it holds firm for three months during this time of year when the new harvest is not yet available, it can keep prices stable. Even if rice merchants have three heads and six arms, they will not be able to resist the power of the government that holds the actual goods. Clearly telling the rice merchants that as long as the black market rises, the price of rationed rice will also rise, it would be strange if the rice merchants did not raise the price of rice. Those in charge of grain administration may use the cliché of "cheap grain hurts farmers" to defend the adjustment of rice prices, but if the price of rice is stable, other prices can also be stable. If other prices are stable, why make the price of rice rise alone? Even if there is a black market, change the ration of 15 catties to a ration of 30 catties. If there is supply but no demand in the market, can the price of rice still rise?

Next is clothing, which is even more in the government's hands. The government has plenty of cotton, cotton yarn, and cloth. In addition to the political power of the Yarn and Cloth Administration, there is also the actual power of the China Textile Corporation. If the government does not plan on the legal currency, with 200,000 bales of cotton yarn, it can keep the price of yarn stable at a certain price this year without drastic changes, not to mention the amount of cotton and cloth in stock. Unfortunately, the government only uses the sale of cotton yarn and cloth as a tool to tighten the money supply, not as a means to stabilize market prices by supplying them at平價. We are accustomed to seeing that after the price of yarn and cloth rises to a certain limit, China Textile is ordered to sell some within the limit. Once in the hands of merchants, of course, the price will rise again. Isn't this ladder-like rise because the government is intentionally or unintentionally hoping for price increases, so that it can collect more legal currency?

The aspect of housing is extremely stable, which cannot but be attributed to the government's hard-pressing measures! Because housing is not within the scope of government allocation, and the government itself does not have many real estate properties that can be used for housing allocation, and the government's housing allocation management and use and the collection of fees are not subject to restrictions. Thus, on the condition that the government is generous at the expense of the owners, the rent in this city has been fixed between 7,000 and 9,000 times due to the resolution of the city council. The cost of living has been reduced a lot, and outsiders have criticized the city council for setting the rent standard too low! From this, it can be seen that the prices of things that are not largely controlled by the government can achieve a stable effect.

As for transportation, all means of transportation by water, land, and air require fuel, and among the fuels, coal, diesel, and gasoline are all in the government's hands. The government says to raise the price, and freight and fares have to rise accordingly. Coal is supplied by the Fuel Management Committee, and diesel and gasoline are handled by the diesel allocation committee of the Detailed Import and Export Management Committee. Without setting price ceilings, the adjustment of coal and oil prices is completely unreasonable. But no matter how unreasonable the reasons are, prices still have to rise, and they rise a little every three days and a lot every ten days, so much so that the water, land, and air transportation industries cannot adjust their rates in time. Moreover, when fuel prices rise by 50%, fares rise by 80%. People have to travel, so they have to pay the high price. Goods have to circulate, so they have to shear wool from the sheep. Layer by layer, who is driving up prices?

Since the reasons for the soaring prices are clear, if the government really has the determination to stabilize prices, it seems that it should first come up with a stable countermeasure. The local authorities in this city are vigorously carrying out inspections, registrations, crackdowns, punishments, etc., which should naturally be earnestly and fairly implemented. But the most important thing is that the central government should first have a determination in the short term, that is, the government's own controlled 物寳 and industries will never lead the price increases. The government should have a long-term vision and regard the profits calculated in legal currency as extremely small, and even subsidize what should be subsidized and lose money where it should lose money. If the government has no capital to lose, it may as well save some from construction projects that are not urgently needed to stabilize prices. Honestly speaking, now, apart from suppressing the rebellion first, the remaining forces should be fully used to stabilize prices! Only when prices are stable can we talk about economic construction. This work requires the mobilization of the entire new government, and it must be mobilized immediately without delay. It cannot be effective with the style of each administrative department doing its own thing, nor can it be half-done by the inquiries and investigations of legislators and supervisors. As for the strict investigations and punishments of local authorities, they are naturally only temporary measures.

### The Development of the International Co-operative Movement

— Chen Zhongming

——Message for the 26th International Co-operative Day——

In today's world, where the "Cold War" between the two major camps is fierce, and people are uneasy about the long-term prospects for peace, 150 million co-operators around the world, regardless of race or nationality, who share a common pursuit of human justice and the maintenance of world peace, are joyfully welcoming the 26th International Co-operative Day, which undoubtedly has epoch-making significance.

As early as a century ago, in 1835, Robert Owen, the founder of the world co-operative movement, attempted to use the power of international cooperation to reduce human exploitation and war and realize his utopian co-operative ideal in the London All Classes of All Nations Association. Owen's world organization was the most primitive form of international cooperation.

From Owen's All Classes of All Nations Association to the International Co-operative Alliance, the development of the international co-operative movement in the entire process of its development to the present stage can be divided into four stages.

From the establishment of the International Co-operative Alliance in 1905 to the conference held in Manchester in 1902, this was the development stage of the international co-operative movement. During this development stage, the ideal and method of international co-operation were determined. The main content was to promote the liberation of the co-operative movement from narrow nationalism and parochialism, and to advance to an international co-operative alliance without race or nationality. This progressive transformation, from the perspective of a co-operative republic and a world commonwealth, from individual to collective, from various countries to international unity, is undeniably a very important task. Although the Rochdale principles may be judged by history today as an unsound path, in the early days of capitalism, for the vast number of toiling masses who were overwhelmed by the tides of the industrial revolution and plunged into hunger and cold, the Rochdale pioneers did indeed perform a very valuable enlightenment work. In the charter of the International Co-operative Alliance, there is the following provision: "This association, in order to inherit the work plan of the Rochdale pioneers, is determined to replace the existing competitive system of private enterprise with a co-operative system based on the principles of self-help and mutual assistance, based on the interests of the entire society, in an independent spirit and in its own way." This is obviously an abstract statement, but it is sufficient to explain the contradiction between the international co-operative movement and the existing private system, and the task it bears. As the late Secretary-General of the International Co-operative Alliance, Mr. May, said: "To unite the people of the world, to enhance the happiness of individuals, and at the same time to create the civilization of the world, that is the ideal of the International Co-operative Alliance. It wants to create a world federation, eliminate war, avoid conflicts, create a social system that never sees wealth or poverty, and establish world peace." The great contribution of the international co-operative movement in this development stage was to determine the overall direction, goals, and tasks of the international co-operative movement, but it did not point out the relationship between the co-operative movement and politics, and the dependence on social systems, nor did it plan specific ways to struggle to realize the ideals of the International Co-operative Alliance, and combine the lofty ideals of the international co-operative movement with reality. Therefore, the international co-operative movement in this development stage can only do some co-operative education and research liaison work for the international co-operative movement.

From the conference held in 1904 until the year before the outbreak of the First World War, it can be said to be the second stage of development of the international co-operative movement. At this time, many progressive co-operators began to pay attention to the significance of the co-operative movement's link with the laboring masses and established the foundation of a new co-operative theory. The Swiss representative, Mr. Muller, advocated reminding consumers of the laboring masses' chain of thought and urged them to understand that the purpose of co-operation is not only to improve their own lives, but to abolish all profits. The promotion of this new co-operative theory did indeed play a very powerful role in promoting the development of the international co-operative movement, constituting the main feature of this development stage, moving from a utopian to a practical and scientific path.

The third stage of development of the international co-operative movement can be said to be a revival from a state of semi-sleepy stagnation. Beginning with the First World War and continuing until 1920, many groups withdrew from the Alliance due to the war, causing regular activities to be suspended invisibly for as long as seven years, which can be said to have fallen into a state of semi-sleep. During this period, although the Alliance passed peace resolutions calling for peace, based on the weakness of the Alliance's own organization, these utopian resolutions and calls for peace were dissolved by the fires of war. It was not until the Paris Conference of the French National Co-operative Alliance in 1916 and the International Co-operative Alliance Conference in 1927 that it was revived from its state of semi-sleep. In the second half of this development stage, it is worth mentioning that the Central Committee stipulated at the eleventh conference held in Ghent, Belgium, that the first Saturday of every July would be International Co-operative Day, and celebrations would be held around the world starting in 1922. This regulation has played a very significant role in the recognition of co-operators and the development of international cooperation. International co-operative organizations have developed extensively and widely during this period, co-operators have closely joined hands with each other, and the co-operative movement has appeared in a brand new posture in the second half of this development stage, forming a united front against capitalism. Its greatest success and greatest contribution lies not in the fact that the international co-operative movement in this development stage has transformed the major industrial co-operative sectors of various countries from individual forms to international forms, but rather that the co-operative movement in this development stage, after being baptized by the fires of the First World War and the blood and flesh, has grown out of battle and established closer ties between the international co-operative movement and the vast number of peasants and workers under the highly developed capitalism. Based on the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations established the International Labour Office Co-operative Department to improve the lives of workers in various countries. This new decision liberated the co-operative movement from the old "purely economic" confines and promoted it in a new direction of political and economic exchange, which was indeed a progressive transformation.

The fourth stage of development, since the international capitalist economy had a total crisis, and the Fascist bandits of Germany, Japan, and Italy formed an aggressive camp, madly launched aggressive wars, while China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, in order to maintain world peace, formed an anti-aggression camp, using war to eliminate war after the destruction of peace, in order to achieve the lasting peace and security of the world's human cooperation movement. During this period, it can also be said that in the first half of this stage of development, it had assisted governments in various countries to salvage the economic crisis, until the Fascist bandits launched aggressive wars, it was undeniably transformed and utilized by the Fascist bandits in the aggressive front, as a way to develop its military and economic power. However, the co-operative movement in the anti-aggression camp bravely donned the anti-aggression battle robe, assisted the United Nations, mobilized the masses, and participated in the work of economic warfare against the enemy. During the war in China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the co-operative movement was developing widely and assumed the epoch-making mission of the anti-aggression war. The mission of the United States, the American co-operators, further convened an international co-operative conference and passed a number of valuable international co-operative movements to cultivate senior co-operative cadres and talents, which means the expansion trend of the international co-operative movement. From the development history of the international co-operative movement over the past century, it has gradually transformed from primitive utopia to the road of scientific reality. It is hoped that the co-operators of the world will move in step from today onwards, work together, and shoulder the new tasks of this new development stage of the international co-operative movement, in order to lay the foundation for the permanent peace of the world.

The fifth stage of development, since the full end of World War II, the world's politics and economy have undergone fundamental changes, and the cooperative cause has also undergone major changes. In particular, the Eastern European countries have adopted new cooperative routes, which have played a major role in socialist construction. This September, the International Cooperative Alliance will hold its first post-war conference in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. There will be epoch-making decisions for the future international cooperative movement. The author will attend on behalf of China at that time, and will report in detail after the conference is over.

### Soviet Unilaterally Abrogates Berlin Joint Control Agreement; Three Powers Declare Non-Recognition; Political and Economic Struggle Unfolds Comprehensively; Wording of Protest Note to Soviets Under Careful Consideration

[Reuters, London, 1st] The Soviet Union's formal announcement that the Berlin Four-Power Allied Military Government has ended has plunged the Berlin crisis, which had seemed to ease in the past 48 hours, back into a complete stalemate. The Soviet Union and the Western powers have entered a comprehensive political and economic struggle in Berlin. In terms of immediate consequences, the U.S., Britain, and France may organize their political and economic life in the western sectors of Berlin on a three-power basis. The Berlin city government may split into two opposing bodies. The Soviet authorities may ban the activities of the Social Democratic Party in the eastern sector of Berlin and handle municipal affairs solely through the Socialist Unity Party, which is controlled by the Communists. In terms of long-term consequences, the Soviet action may further widen the diplomatic rift between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. In London, Bevin met with the U.S. and French ambassadors again today, indicating that the three powers' position on the Berlin issue will remain unchanged.

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] A British spokesman said that the three powers do not intend to take any action regarding the Soviet withdrawal from the Berlin Four-Power Allied Military Government until new instructions are received from London, Washington, and Paris. The administration of the western sectors of Berlin will be jointly responsible by the British, American, and French Berlin commanders for the time being. Another British written statement stressed that the British military government cannot recognize that the agreement on the four-power joint control of Berlin can be terminated by the verbal notification of a Soviet staff officer. The British military government will continue to abide by the agreement on the four-power joint control of Berlin signed by the Allied governments.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] U.S. Ambassador Douglas visited Foreign Secretary Bevin this morning, presumably to report to Bevin on the steps that the United States believes the Western three powers should take after the Soviet withdrawal from the Berlin joint military government. Tao received instructions from Washington last night. An hour before visiting Zhiwen, he attended a meeting of the three-power standing committee, which consisted of Sir Strang, Director of the German Department of the British Foreign Office, French Ambassador Massigli, and Tao. Colonel Holley, commander of the U.S. Army in Berlin, hinted today that the three powers would formally announce the implementation of three-power control in the western sectors of Berlin. British spokesmen in London and Berlin said that the reasons for the Soviet withdrawal from the Berlin joint military government were invalid. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the deterioration of the situation in Berlin was deeply regrettable. He pointed out that the establishment of the joint military government was based on the 1944 tripartite agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union and cannot be unilaterally abrogated by one country. It is believed here that the three-power standing committee in London is not currently preparing a direct note to the Soviet Union, but is considering practical measures to deal with the emergency situation in Berlin. The note to the Soviet Union will be submitted unanimously at a later date.

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] The Western three countries are drafting a protest note to the Soviet Union. Diplomatic officials said that France has been uneasy for several months due to the Western position in Germany being too tough, so they emphasized that they must proceed with caution and opposed all "hasty and ill-considered" actions. A certain diplomat stated, "The problem lies in finding a middle ground between a protest that is too weak and a farewell letter that is too strong."

### Outline of West German Constitutional Plan; Allied Military Government Retains Minimum Regulatory Authority; Leaders of Eleven German States to Study Fully

[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 1st] The commanders-in-chief of the British, American, and French forces in Germany all attended the West Sector Administrative Director Conference today. The conference discussed (1) electing a German constitutional assembly no later than September 1st; (2) reorganizing the occupying authorities; (3) delineating the boundaries between the West German states. After the conference agenda was decided, the administrative directors requested an extension of the conference to consult with their respective state governments. The administrative directors will gather in Koblenz on the 7th and 8th to discuss the Allied proposals. The date for a joint meeting with the Allied commanders has not yet been determined.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 1st] The premiers of the eleven West German states began implementing the first stage of the new West German constitution today. They met with the heads of the three-power military government at the U.S. military headquarters here, and after receiving the three-power proposals on the West German constitutional plan, they expressed their determination to convene the constitutional assembly as scheduled before September 1st. General Clay clarified the main points of the West German constitutional plan to the participating Gu총理, saying that the constitutional assembly will draft a democratic constitution, stipulating a federal government structure, and its system should be suitable for Germany to eventually complete national unification. The democratic constitution will also protect the rights of the states and the rights and freedoms of individuals. The procedure for the states to elect representatives to the constitutional assembly may be freely determined by the state legislatures. The total number of representatives to the constitutional assembly will generally be one representative for every 750,000 people. After the constitution is drafted by the constitutional assembly, it must be submitted to a referendum in each state for public decision after being approved by the Allied military government chiefs. If more than two-thirds of the states express their consent by a majority of the people, it will be binding on the states within thirty days from the date of approval. According to another draft of the occupation law, after the establishment of the West German constitutional government, the military chiefs of the occupying powers will still retain the following powers, including (1) German diplomatic relations; (2) control of foreign trade, domestic measures that may affect foreign trade, and the appropriate use of funds available to Germany; (3) implement agreed-upon regulatory powers, including the Ruhr control regime, compensation, industrial standards, abolition of armaments and disarmament, division of trust organizations, and certain sectors of scientific research; (4) safeguard the reputation and security of the occupying forces and ensure that their needs are met within limits; (5) ensure that the West German constitution is strictly observed. Except for the aforementioned reserved powers, the military chiefs may only exercise their full powers in the event of an emergency that threatens security. Clay also specifically pointed out that one of the original basic goals of the occupation, namely, the democratization of Germany, was not listed in the reserved powers of the military chiefs. Regarding this point, the Allied military chiefs are only responsible for inspecting, assisting, and providing advice to the German authorities.

### Truman Supports Marshall, Statement on Remaining in Berlin

When asked whether the current dispute between the Cominform and the South Communist leader will affect the plan of the meeting, the spokesperson replied, "We are preparing and assuming that the conference will be convened.

### Finnish General Election, High Voter Turnout, U.S.-Finnish Loan Negotiations

[Reuters, Helsinki, 2nd] The right-wing and centrist parties, which were not very interested in the election, enthusiastically voted in the general election on the 1st and 2nd. Reports from many constituencies across the country stated that the number of voters was 100% of registered voters.

### Berlin Blockade Leads to Material Shortages; Soviet Union Reaps What It Sows; British and American Planes Intensify Food Airlift

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 2nd (Radio): Currently, the British and American airlift of food to West Berlin exceeds the needs of its over two and a half million residents. The Soviet attempt to blockade West Berlin has produced the opposite result, which they did not anticipate. On the other hand, the Soviet side has been affected by the blockade. It has been reported that the Soviet zone recently experienced a shortage of flour, penicillin, and special medicines for lung disease and diabetes. It is rumored that the Soviet side now intends to lift the blockade to exchange for the materials they lack with Britain and the United States.

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 2nd (Radio): U.S. officials stated today that the British and American food airlift to Berlin has defeated the Soviet food blockade of West Berlin. They said that by July 15, the British and American airlift would provide sufficient food for two million Berlin residents, enough to last until September 1. Currently, British and American planes are transporting food to West Berlin day and night, at a rate of 1,100 tons every 24 hours.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] U.S. military government officials revealed that British transport planes will soon drop coal, needed by West Berlin, at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games site.

### Yugoslav Communists Send Telegram to Stalin, Urging the Communist Information Bureau to Withdraw Accusations; Yugoslav Military and Civilians Express Loyalty to Tito

[Reuters, Belgrade, 2nd] Fifteen thousand members of the Yugoslav People's Front, after attending meetings related to the Fifth National Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party, sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin, asking him to do his utmost to have the Communist Information Bureau withdraw its unfounded accusations against the Yugoslav state, the Yugoslav Communist Party, and the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party.

### India Welcomes US Aid Loans, but Fears Loss of Sovereignty; Secretary of the Indian National Congress Speaks at Labor Conference

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 1st] Ranga, a member of the Indian delegation attending the International Labor Organization conference, said on the 1st that India does not want foreign aid for its industrial development to be provided in a "collusive" manner. Ranga is the secretary of the National Congress Party of India. He answered a statement made by former U.S. Ambassador to India, Grady, at the recent Far East Economic Conference held in India during a press conference held here.

According to Ranga, Grady stated that if India and other Far Eastern countries need U.S. capital, they must guarantee that the U.S. receives rewards. "He makes us suspect that the U.S. investment in India requires us to recognize its right to infringe upon our economic freedom and sovereignty." "I am speaking on behalf of the National Congress. We need to know the amount and conditions of the investment. India welcomes foreign capital and technology to strengthen its contribution to world democracy, but we oppose any assistance that could put us in a colonial position."

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Former U.S. Ambassador to India, Grady, said on the 1st that he believes India has no reason to worry that U.S. capital or other foreign capital will threaten its economy. He said that Indians worry that a large amount of foreign investment will dominate the Indian economy, and they firmly believe that this kind of economic monopoly will negate their efforts to achieve political independence. "Because of the difficulty in gaining political independence, Indians have not yet decided on a policy to encourage foreign investment. Given time, they will be able to overcome this fear." Grady will soon leave here for Athens to take up his new position as U.S. Ambassador to Greece.

### Nationwide Strike in Italy; Millions Participate; Labor Unrest Also Occurs in French Ports Such as Marseille

[Report from Our Newspaper] Rome, 2nd (Radio): The nationwide strike in Italy, instigated by the Communist Party, began this afternoon. Millions are participating.

[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] The nationwide labor unrest instigated by the Communist General Confederation of Labor has been launched this afternoon.

It is expected that Arab leaders fear that the Soviet Union will supply weapons to the Jewish side after the resumption of the Holy Land War, so they have to consider it carefully.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Arab League's point-by-point rejection of Bernadotte's Palestine peace proposals is expected to be announced by the Arab League Political Committee in Cairo on Saturday.

### Turbulent Latin America

— Sent by Weng Shaoqiu from New York

—An Undisclosed Concern for the US—

American money, flowing across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to aid the recovery of various nations, now finds that its own neighborhood is disorderly and chaotic. As the US devotes itself to aiding Europe, the unrest in Latin America is becoming increasingly apparent.

The security of Latin America is as important as the security of Europe and Asia, and the US is naturally concerned. The large-scale bloodshed in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, a few months ago is one example of the unrest in Latin America. There has been a political rebellion in Costa Rica in Central America, and Chile and Brazil have also experienced a trend of strikes, costing a number of lives. In Guatemala, a revolutionary plot has been revealed.

The security of Latin America is as important as the security of Europe and Asia, and the US is naturally concerned. The large-scale bloodshed in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, a few months ago is one example of the unrest in Latin America. There has been a political rebellion in Costa Rica in Central America, and Chile and Brazil have also experienced a trend of strikes, costing a number of lives. In Guatemala, a revolutionary plot has been revealed.

The US will pour more money into stabilizing Latin America, but the question is whether US money can quell the current unrest in time.

The fundamental cause of instability in Latin America is low wages and rising prices. The people's standard of living was already low, and now, with inflation, life is even more difficult. Opposition parties and Communists seize this opportunity to create as much trouble as possible.

The difficult situations in each country vary, but the countries with the most severe inflation have the most difficulties. The government is weak, while the power of the Communist Party is gradually becoming stronger.

The current situation in Latin American countries is analyzed as follows:

Brazil has a population of 47 million, and most people cannot afford to buy necessities. The current cost of living is three times higher than in 1940. The Brazilian industry is mostly weaving and other light industries, but heavy industry has begun to develop. The main exports are agricultural products, and Brazil's coffee exports rank first in the world. The government led by President Dutra is a government for the people.

The Brazilian Communist Party has about 150,000 members and has recently been declared an illegal organization by the government. The party is now engaged in underground activities and is carrying out a strike movement.

Brazil experienced a revolution in 1930, which resulted in the dictatorship of Vargas, who was later overthrown. Currently, a revolution is unlikely to occur in Brazil unless Vargas cooperates with the Communist Party and obtains the support of a portion of the army. However, the Communist Party will still create other troubles.

Paraguay has a population of one million, and farmers still live a primitive agricultural life. The 8,000 Communist Party members in Paraguay make President Moniz anxious. The Paraguayan government is a dictatorship. Paraguay experienced a revolution last year, which almost succeeded. Paraguay will continue to experience revolutions at any time. Once a revolution succeeds, Moniz's intended successor, Gonzalez, may not be able to succeed as president. Gonzalez is preparing to take office as president on August 15.

Chile is the world's largest exporter of saltpeter and copper. The country has a population of six million and is currently threatened by inflation. Most of Chile's industry is light industry, but the government is building a steel mill and developing forestry and fisheries. The government led by President Videla is a democratic government. The Communist Party has about 50,000 members, and the government is trying to disperse the power of the Communist Party and stop strikes and work stoppages.

Chile experienced a revolution 15 years ago. Currently, a revolution is unlikely unless the Communist Party obtains the support of the army or the national police, but work stoppages and riots are likely to occur at any time.

The economic lifeline of Bolivia is the export of metals, mainly tin. The country has a population of four million, and the people's standard of living can be said to be the lowest in the Western Hemisphere. It is also experiencing inflation. Politically, the government led by President Hertzog is a democratic government, and the Communist Party is weak. There was a revolution in 1946, and there has been no serious political threat since then. A revolution may occur in the short term if the tin market declines.

Peru's President Luis led a government that was initially a democratic government, but after a series of political assassinations, the president announced the dissolution of Congress.

Peru has a population of eight million, and the cost of living is three times higher than before the war due to rising prices. The main industrial products are metals and light industry.

The Peruvian Communist Party claims to have 35,000 members, but its actual strength is not great. There was a revolution in 1933. There is no revolutionary trend at present, but the opposition party is very strong, and a revolution is possible at any time.

Ecuador (also known as the Equator) has had 15 presidents and several provisional governments in the past 20 years. The current president, Yerosmena, intends to organize a democratic administration, but the government is unsound.

Ecuador has a population of 3.3 million, and most people are engaged in farming and animal husbandry. The Communist Party has 2,500 members. (To be continued)

(C) Public sale of food and stabilize rice prices: (1) Accelerate the preparation of public food sales and implement comprehensive rationing. (2) Starting from the 3rd, temporarily allow the North and South markets to open, with prices not exceeding 16 million yuan per shi. (D) Crack down on over-the-counter securities trading, maintain normal transactions, and thoroughly dismantle the intercom phones outside the general market. Pay special attention to the activities of "Hengshu" and large investors, and those who violate the law will be detained. (E) Secretly investigate speculative manipulators in various industries. In addition to setting separate disposal measures for the main culprits, the remaining individuals will be sent to the Special Criminal Court to be severely punished in accordance with the "Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Republic of China During the Suppression of Rebellion."

### Commander Xuan Describes Current Shanghai as a Volcano; Convenes Businessmen from Various Industries to Decide on Four Emergency Measures

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to prevent prices from soaring after the market opens today, the municipal authorities, led by Mayor Wu, Chairman Pan, Commander Xuan, and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, jointly convened a discussion meeting with representatives of various trade associations in the city at the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. Four emergency measures were formulated as follows: (1) Prohibit speculative funds from entering Shanghai. Hereafter, passengers on airplanes, ships, and trains will be strictly limited to carrying no more than 200 million yuan. Military police and security forces will strictly inspect the transport of cash by agencies and troops. Those exceeding the limit will be ordered to deposit it in the Central Bank, and the purpose of its use must be verified when it is used. (2) Strictly inspect all warehouses. Private warehouses must register their materials with the Social Affairs Bureau by the 6th of this month. Those who fail to do so will be sealed up and severely punished. (3) The transactions of daily necessities must be accurately registered. (4) Strictly crack down on "passing the buck" (speculation). Please have the various trade associations formulate their own prevention measures, and the Social Affairs Bureau will formulate measures to control warehouse receipts.

The representatives of various industries who attended yesterday afternoon included Xu Jilu from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Ge Jichen, Xu Xueyu from the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Shi Zhifu from the new medicine industry, Guo Lingshuang, Huang Zukang, and Xiao Zongjun from the China-Great Company, Zhan Peilin from the paper industry, Pei Yuanding from the rayon industry, Ye Jinrong from the coal industry, Zhang Wenkui from the department store industry, Shan Wenjun from the miscellaneous grains industry, Chen Tingfang from the sugar industry, Shen Rixin from the money industry, Ma Zhongda from the import-export industry, Zhang Hanbai from the warehouse industry, Dong Yunfeng from the cotton industry, Rong Yiren from the flour industry, Wang Zhuyi from the textile industry, Qu Zhenhua from the rice industry, Zhang Chao from the oil industry, Li Tingdong from the China Vegetable Oil Factory, Hong Wenjiang from the pork industry, and Ma Wenbiao from the vegetable industry, among more than 40 people. Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Chairman Pan successively expressed their opinions, speaking with great insight and seriousness. Xu Xueyu and Luo Qinghua also expressed their views. The following is a summary:

Mayor Wu: The soaring prices in the past few days have been alarming. In order to prevent price fluctuations after the banks reopen, we have convened representatives from various industries today to discuss countermeasures together. The government will not deny that rising prices are due to inflation. However, the inflation rate is by no means as severe as the soaring prices. If we do not find ways to curb it, it will threaten people's livelihoods and public security. Those who will bear the brunt of the problem will be you. I went to the Garrison Command today to discuss policies with the military leaders. From now on, the transport of cash by military aircraft and various military agencies will be strictly inspected. I believe that as long as we get through July steadily, we can expect to utilize U.S. aid in mid-August, and the price situation will improve. Therefore, the government is determined to control prices this time and hopes that all industries will cooperate sincerely and work together to overcome this most difficult short period.

### Determined to Use Human Intervention Methods to Sanction Artificially Inflated Prices

Commander Xuan: Judging from the rampant price increases of the past ten days, Shanghai is like a volcano. Mayor Wu and I have repeatedly requested to resign to avoid the eruption of this volcano. However, as long as we are in office, we will strive to salvage the situation. The most worrying thing at the moment is the general public's adversarial attitude towards merchants, unanimously believing that merchants are hoarding and manipulating goods, thereby depriving the people of their right to survival. The formation of such an adversarial front cannot be ignored in the future. I believe that those who disrupt the financial system through improper means are only a small number of merchants. The majority of legitimate merchants are willing to do everything possible to save themselves from this crisis. The current price surge clearly has artificial factors, so the authorities have decided to use equally artificial methods to sanction it.

Commander Xuan further added: Those who are anxious about the current situation should not only be government authorities, but also everyone here. Because currently, the city's security forces are sufficient to prevent all activities and concealment of the communists. However, when people are forced to take radical actions due to livelihood difficulties, it will be impossible to stop them. At that time, Mayor Wu and I will at most be detained or dismissed for investigation, while everyone's lives, families, property, and careers will all be destroyed. Therefore, I hope everyone will save themselves and others in time.

The Biggest Key Lies with Those Implementing the Policies

Chairman Pan: The recent crazy price increases in Shanghai were alarming. Before the central government announces specific measures, the municipal authorities must first find ways to suppress them. Otherwise, Shanghai may descend into chaos. The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated in an editorial a few days ago, "If the municipal government does not come up with a solution, Shanghai will collapse before the communists even attack." The situation is so critical that I hope the municipal government and the people can cooperate quickly to overcome these difficulties together. The implementation of any policy requires sincere cooperation between the two to be effective. Therefore, I would like to say frankly that the biggest key lies with those who implement the policies. If the implementers are not fair and impartial, even the best policies will be distorted. We are all living on a volcano right now and must salvage the situation before it erupts. I hope that all implementers appointed by the government will first pledge to Heaven that they will wholeheartedly serve the country and will not be corrupt, so as not to give the business community an excuse. At the same time, I want to implore people in the business community not to tempt the implementers.

Are There Shortages in Military Pay? Has There Been Panic Buying of Supplies?

Regarding the rampant price increases in the city, it is generally believed to be caused by speculative capital. Many people also believe that most of this speculative capital comes from the military. It is said that entire boxes of banknotes are transported to the front lines to pay soldiers, but then brought back to buy supplies. We cannot easily believe such rumors, but merchants certainly do not want this situation to exist. If we receive such information in the future, we can immediately report it to the relevant authorities. We advocate that if such cases are discovered, they must be severely punished. A few people should be executed to appease the public. Currently, the biggest expenditure in our country is military pay, but much of the military pay is actually shortfalls. We must thoroughly investigate these shortfalls. If military pay is indeed returning to the market, we must impose the most severe sanctions!

The Government Should Suppress Prices and First Lead by Example

Xu Xueyu: Ships from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arriving from Tianjin and Beijing have been found to be carrying large numbers of "danbang" (small-scale carriers), each carrying 200 million legal tender, which can earn them 60 million in exchange rate arbitrage. Since what they carry does not exceed the government's regulations, how should we stop this? Please, authorities, devise a method. Regarding suppressing prices, the government should first lead by example. The Fuel Control Committee plans to raise fuel prices by 160% starting tomorrow (the 3rd). Diesel prices have risen from 46 million to over 90 million in ten days, and will increase by another 45% starting from the 4th. If the items controlled by the government itself are the first to rise, how can we demand that private companies not raise prices? The government controls three of the four essential aspects of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation. But as a result, the price increases are the most severe. Therefore, I believe that to suppress prices, we must first demand that the items controlled by the government not be allowed to increase!

Businesses Should Endure the Pain and Sacrifice, but the Government Must Lead

Luo Qinghua: I would like to offer some fundamental advice. I believe that once China's economy collapses, people will resort to robbery, beatings, killings, and arson. The business community will be the first to bear the brunt. Therefore, the business community should rely on the government for survival. The mayor believes that as long as we can smoothly get through July, things will improve thereafter. During this short period, we must endure the pain and sacrifice, and cooperate sincerely. However, we must demand that the government take the lead. The government must first lead by example and be determined to sacrifice, so that merchants can follow suit.

Finally, Mayor Wu inquired about the transaction registration and material application situation of each industry. The meeting ended at around 7 p.m.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Thoroughly Investigate the Speculative Market

[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd Dispatch] Military News Agency: Chiang Ching-kuo, under the President's orders, left Nanjing again for Shanghai at 3:10 p.m. on the 2nd. He will work with relevant authorities to take stern measures and thoroughly investigate the speculative market.

### Merchants Are Heartless and Collude with Japanese Residents in Smuggling. Large Quantities of Steel Needles and Seafood Smuggled. The Case Was Detected and Cracked by the Bureau of Investigation and Security. Lawsuits Filed Against Sheng Yu and Yosh井睦祜

[Our Report] It has been almost three years since the victory, but Sino-Japanese trade has not yet begun. However, the profits to be made from Japanese goods in our city have led some unscrupulous people to collude with Japanese residents and engage in smuggling. Recently, it was discovered that a man named Sheng Yu colluded with a Japanese resident, Yosh井睦祜, who has been living in Shanghai for 30 years, using the Japanese ship Nisshin Maru to smuggle a large quantity of seafood to Shanghai. Unfortunately, the scheme was not secret and was ultimately detected and cracked by the Bureau of Investigation and Security of the Ministry of National Defense.

Yosh井睦祜 is from Fukuyama Prefecture, Japan, and is 55 years old this year. He has lived in Shanghai for more than 30 years. During the War of Resistance, he worked in mining in Shanxi and ran a firewood business in Tianjin. In Shanghai, he served as the president of the enemy's "East Asia Science Research Association" and the chairman of the "International Friendship Association." After the victory, he was retained in Shanghai in the name of a member of the Committee for Japanese Affairs. However, he colluded with Sheng Yu, a Chinese national whom he had known since the War of Resistance. The two parties raised 120 million legal tender and, in March of the 36th year of the Republic, Yosh井 first bought a batch of American saccharin and sent it to the Nisshin Maru to be transported to Japan. Then, in April, Yosh井 smuggled more than ten boxes of steel needles from Japan and handed them over to Sheng Yu and another person named Liu to be sold on behalf of Song Baosheng at No. 11, Guangming Village, Jiangning Road, earning more than 60 million. Later, Yosh井 also claimed that he had two Japanese fishing boats, using his industrial company name, that had already entered the Huangpu River. He wished to fish in Chinese territory and brought 100 boxes of fish. Then, Liu and Yosh井 planned to negotiate with various fishing companies, but neither dared to come forward, and the customs did not allow them to stay. The next day, they sailed back to Japan. According to Yosh井, the saccharin was worth 500 million, and part of it belonged to a Zhu. In addition to the steel needles, the smuggled goods also included a large quantity of sea cucumbers and shark fins, which were transported by two Japanese named Ueno and Matsubara and handed over to a Japanese named Seno to be sold by Sheng, Liu, and others.

At the same time, Sheng established a Fumin Company in Shanghai, where 12 receipts and account books were found, all proving that Sheng and others had frequent financial dealings with Yosh井 and other Japanese and colluded with each other in large-scale smuggling.

After the Bureau of Investigation and Security was ordered to transfer the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public lawsuit against Yosh井睦祜 and Sheng Yu for smuggling and collusion with foreigners, in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Smuggling and Tax Evasion.

Yosh井 has been detained by the District Prosecutor's Office. Sheng Yu, due to suffering from stomach tumors, has been released on bail and is receiving medical treatment in another location.

### China National Aviation Corporation Adds Special Beijing-Shanghai Passenger Flights

[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has recently reduced the number of flights on various routes. Among them, most flights from Shanghai to various locations pass through Nanjing, and the reduction in the number of flights has de facto reduced the number of flights between Beijing and Shanghai as well. However, a large number of newspapers, mail, etc. transported from Shanghai to Beijing every day are time-sensitive, and many people travel between Beijing and Shanghai for urgent official business. In order to meet the needs, the company has added special Beijing-Shanghai flights starting from the 5th of this month, with two round trips each day. The first flight departs from Shanghai at 7:30 a.m. and arrives in Beijing at 8:40 a.m., departs from Beijing at 11:00 a.m. and arrives in Shanghai at 12:10 p.m. The second flight departs from Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. and arrives in Beijing at 4:10 p.m., departs from Beijing at 5:30 p.m. and arrives in Shanghai at 6:40 p.m. In addition, in order to serve the public, the company will broadcast the arrival times of flights to Shanghai from various locations and any changes at 11:58 a.m., 1:45 p.m., and 2:01 p.m. daily on the 600 K.C. public radio station, starting from the 5th of this month.

The stamps are available in both perforated and unperforated versions, making them a great target for philatelists.

### Movie Theaters Divided over Protests Against Western Film Distributors

[Our Report] The city's first-run movie theaters are now divided into two factions regarding their protests against Western film distributors. The larger theaters that were originally first-run theaters before the war have sufficient equipment and are confident in their box office success. Therefore, they have decided to stand firm against Western film distributors. They say they would rather show domestic films than be held hostage by Western film distributors. However, some first-run movie theaters with poorer equipment and locations are worried that there will not be enough domestic films produced and that changing to domestic films so abruptly will inevitably affect their box office revenue. Therefore, for the sake of their own survival, they have already attempted to seek a compromise with Western film distributors. However, as of last night, there has been no formal indication as to whether Western film distributors will accept their compromise or set a new price increase standard to determine whether to supply new films. According to the Movie Theater Industry Association, it will be clear within a day or two whether moviegoers in the city will be able to see the new films that have been previously advertised by the movie theaters.

### Household Rice Distributed, Supply Rice Sales Suspended

[Our Report] During the recent rice price surge, the People's Livelihood Survey Committee (民調會) adopted a temporary measure, releasing 6,000 "shi" (石, a unit of dry volume) of rice every other day to allow citizens to purchase supply rice (供應米) at one "sheng" (升, a unit of dry volume) per purchase certificate. Now that household rice (戶口米) has been distributed starting on the 1st of this month, this temporary measure is no longer necessary, and the sale of supply rice will be suspended starting today.

### Five Rice Merchants Prosecuted for Selling Rice Beyond the Limit

[Our Report] The owners of the following rice shops in the city – Zhao Xiangyuan of Kaitai Rice Shop, Guo Depin, Ge Xiangsheng of Tongdetai Rice Shop, Shi Youcai of Runtaixiang Rice Shop, and Zhou Wenxi of Xiangtai Rice Shop – were prosecuted for violating the law by privately selling door-to-door rice at prices exceeding 10 million yuan per "shi". The case was concluded after investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, and they were prosecuted for violating the Food Management Act During Emergency Periods.

### Fire on Linsen West Road This Morning

[Our Report] A fire broke out in the kitchen of Mao Datong Sofa Shop at No. 1578 Linsen West Road at 1:30 a.m. this morning. The fire was discovered by passers-by, who woke up the people in the shop and called the police for help. In an instant, the flames spread to the neighboring Taishan Store at No. 1576 and the Su Xietai Paint Shop at No. 1580. The fire was extinguished by firefighters at around 2 a.m. The losses were minimal, and there were no deaths or injuries.

### Crisis in the Publishing Industry: Purchasing Power Drops to the Extreme, Revenue Insufficient to Pay Salaries

[Our Report] Amid the decline of all industries, the cultural publishing industry is particularly severely affected. Li Bojia, chairman of the Book Industry Association, told reporters yesterday that the problem facing the publishing industry today is no longer a matter of making or losing money, nor is it a matter of whether book sales revenue can cover the cost of paper. Far beyond that, the publishing industry's predicament has reached the point where monthly business revenue is insufficient to pay even salaries. For example, printing costs increased twice in June, and newsprint prices increased more than threefold, while book prices could not be raised proportionally. Because at a time when the majority of the people are struggling to make ends meet, the purchasing power for books has fallen to the extreme, and few books sell more than 1,000 copies. Recently, the Commercial Press sold cheap books at prices lower than newsprint, but there were still few buyers, and the future of culture is very worrying. Most of the smaller bookstores do not publish new books, relying on selling old books to survive. Large bookstores such as Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Book Company have also greatly reduced the number of new books they publish. The textbook business, which is the main source of income for various bookstores, was not very good in the first half of the year either. Due to transportation difficulties and blockages, a batch of textbooks scheduled to be sold in the Northeast is still piled up in Beiping and cannot be transported north. As a result, funds cannot be circulated, and the losses are very large. In addition, the recent war in Kaifeng destroyed a large number of textbooks, resulting in even greater losses. If this continues, the future of the book industry is unimaginable.

### A Comedic Suicide Scene: Lovers Go to Suzhou to Commit Suicide by Taking Poison Together, But the Drug Is Fake and They Celebrate Their Renewed Life

[Our Suzhou Office, 1st Dispatch] Wang Zhongbai, an employee of the Sichuan Construction Bank on Shanghai's Jiangxi Middle Road, came to Suzhou with his lover, Shen Zhang (who works in the fingerprint section of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division), on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. They checked into the Lexiang Hotel in Suzhou that day. The next day, the two stayed in their room and did not come out. They wrote three farewell letters and asked the tea server to mail them. Then, they both took "Atering", a nerve tranquilizer they had bought beforehand, in an attempt to commit suicide. However, by noon on the 1st, the relatives and friends in Shanghai received the two's farewell letters and sent urgent telegrams to Suzhou to inquire about what had happened. Police officers were then sent to check on them and unexpectedly found the two lying on the bed, not poisoned. After examination by a doctor, it was found that there was no toxic substance and that the drug was probably fake. When questioned, the two admitted that they had attempted suicide by taking poison. Wang Zhongbai is currently being treated at Guangming Hospital because he has a slight fever. Shen was summoned to the bureau for questioning and has now been released on bail, awaiting pickup by the Shanghai Police Bureau. It is said that the two had a dispute in love and originally planned to end their lives in Suzhou. Fortunately, the drug they took was not poisonous, and they only staged a comedic scene.

### Regulations to Crackdown on Vehicles Exceeding Fuel Limits

[Our Report] Vehicles in the city are originally issued fuel purchase permits (購油證), which specify the amount of fuel that can be purchased at gas stations. However, recently, some vehicles have been found to be purchasing more fuel than the amount specified on their fuel purchase permits for the entire month. The municipal government believes that this situation not only hinders the overall gasoline supply, but also renders the fuel purchase permits ineffective, causing significant impact. Therefore, it has formulated measures to crack down on this, which have been approved by the Municipal Conference: (1) For the first time that a vehicle is found to have purchased more fuel than the specified amount, the excess amount will be deducted when the fuel purchase permit is reissued next time. (2) If a vehicle is found to have exceeded the amount again for the second time, the Public Utilities Bureau will, depending on the severity of the circumstances, issue a penalty of one to three months of suspending the fuel purchase permit. (3) If a vehicle is found to have exceeded the specified amount for the third time, its fuel purchase permit will be permanently revoked. (4) If gas station personnel sell fuel to vehicles in excess of the amount specified on the fuel purchase permit, or accommodate vehicle owners without permits, the Gasoline Allocation Committee will order the oil company to severely punish them. (5) If a fuel purchase permit is lost, it should be immediately declared in the newspaper (posted in three major newspapers in the city for one day each). After one month from the date of publication, a replacement permit may be obtained.

### The Municipal Council Sends a Telegram to the Executive Yuan Requesting the Retention of the Weary Mayor: It Is Advisable Not to Change Local Leaders at This Time and in This Place

[Our Report] During the closing ceremony of the Sixth General Assembly of the Municipal Council the other day, Mayor Wu revealed his intention to resign. Upon hearing the news, the councilors unanimously proposed to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan in the name of the assembly to request his retention. The text of the telegram was drafted and sent by the secretariat of the council that night. Here is the excerpt: To Premier Weng and Deputy Premier Zhang Jun of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: We have just heard that Mayor Wu Guozhen of our city has telegraphed the central government requesting his resignation. Upon hearing the news, we are deeply alarmed. Since Mayor Wu took office in Shanghai, he has made many achievements and the people are happy and content. Currently, we are in a time of social unrest and economic turmoil. At this time and in this place, it is advisable not to change local leaders. Therefore, all the councilors of the Sixth General Assembly of the Council unanimously expressed their sincere request for his retention. We are sending this telegram to you, and if Mayor Wu has already telegraphed your esteemed office expressing his weariness, we sincerely implore you to grant him a reprieve in order to reassure the people. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Xu Jiqing, Deputy Speaker, respectfully greet you.

### Telegram to the Legislative Yuan Requesting Delay in Deliberating Property Tax Bill

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council recently sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan requesting a postponement in discussing the property tax bill. The content of the telegram is as follows: To President Sun and Vice President Chen Junjian of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, and to all esteemed members of the Legislative Yuan: It has been noted that your Yuan's member Liu Butong and 48 others believe that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, a small number of people took advantage of the opportunities presented by inflation to accumulate unlimited wealth, leading to a widening gap between the rich and the poor, while these wealth accumulators bear no burden to the nation. Now, with the war expanding and the foundation of the nation in peril, the crux of the matter lies in how to make these wealthy individuals willingly contribute funds to equalize the distribution of social wealth and meet the needs of national reconstruction. Therefore, with this aim in mind, they proposed immediately levying a temporary property tax and drafted a bill, which has been submitted to your Yuan for review. We, the members of this council, deeply admire the reasons put forth by member Liu and others for levying the property tax, as they are both stern and righteous.

Difficulties and Disturbances Inevitable if Implemented

However, upon close examination of the contents of the property tax bill currently under review by your Yuan, its legislative principles include both personal and territorial jurisdiction. Its taxation targets include individuals and corporations, its taxation scope covers land, houses, equipment, automobiles, ships, and goods, its minimum taxable amount is as low as 50,000 yuan before the war, and its tax rate ranges from 5% to 50% or 60%. If implemented as passed, it is feared that the entire country will be thrown into turmoil, that legitimate production and business will be unable to survive, that the benefits will be unseen, and that the drawbacks will be numerous and chaotic. Please consider the reasons stated below:

(1) The draft bill stipulates that all real estate and movable property owned by citizens of the Republic of China abroad and non-citizens of the Republic of China within the country will be taxed. While the wording is fair and appealing, how can it be practically achieved? Nationals with property abroad can conceal their identities and seek protection from foreigners. Those individuals possess great resources and sophisticated methods. If it were possible to levy taxes according to the regulations, then the work of utilizing overseas deposits would have been accomplished long ago. The original proposer of this case, member Liu Butong, and the current Minister of Finance, Wang Yunwu, both personally supervised and guided the special levy for relief. They should deeply understand the difficulties involved. Based on past examples, the effectiveness is evident. As for the property of foreigners in the country, regardless of whether there are diplomatic issues, while welcoming foreign investment to China to assist in production, implementing measures to levy heavy taxes would be self-contradictory and run counter to our goals.

Genuine Wealth Evading Abroad

(2) The draft bill stipulates that the property of natural persons and legal entities must be taxed equally. In this situation, the truly wealthy, because their assets have already been moved abroad, seeking protection from foreigners, do not need to worry about being taxed. Even those within the country can easily conceal their wealth by holding gold, foreign currency, and other movable assets. Taking the effectiveness of our country's handling of inheritance tax in recent years as an example, it can be seen that, before the national property registration system is perfected, levying property tax on the movable property of natural persons is clearly akin to wishful thinking. Only those engaged in industry and commerce, with their goods, equipment, machinery, factory buildings, ships, and vehicles, which are all in plain sight and impossible to hide, will have to truthfully declare and pay taxes according to the regulations. Considering their actual economic situation, under the current state of inflation, production tools cannot be sold or mortgaged, goods and raw materials are gradually decreasing, wages are high, taxes are heavy, and purchasing power is weak. They are struggling daily to raise funds and maintain their operations through borrowing. However, when assessing their assets, they often amount to hundreds of billions or trillions. If heavy taxes are levied according to the current tax rate, they will inevitably have to sell goods and raw materials, using most of what they rely on for turnover and operations to pay to the national treasury, which will still be insufficient. After selling off their assets, they will face bankruptcy. All production enterprises will be wiped out, and millions of workers will lose their jobs.

Everyone Becomes a Target of Taxation

(3) What is particularly dangerous is that, with the current rate of inflation, in just a few months, the total amount of property owned by an average middle-class family will exceed 30 billion yuan. In other words, everyone will inevitably become a target of taxation. Furthermore, because there are rewards for whistleblowing, with 30% of the recovered taxes being awarded to the informant if successful, and no liability for false accusations if unsuccessful, at a time when political integrity is declining and social morality is deteriorating, how can this not lead to turmoil and a loss of public support?

(4) Capital is fleeing far to foreign countries and near to Hong Kong, and the government is working hard to prevent this. If property tax must be levied, it will inevitably create a greater exodus of capital. The wealthy will take flight far away, while those with less will speculate in gold and cash. No one will invest in or operate legitimate production enterprises anymore. What kind of situation will this lead to? The recent surge in the black market exchange rate and commodity prices is due to this.

Government Taxation Should Be Done Responsibly

This council believes that the enactment of laws should be based on conforming to public sentiment, and the government's taxation should be limited to collecting without oppression. The property tax bill currently under review by your Yuan already demonstrates its great harm in the aspects mentioned above. Moreover, our country has been handling income tax for more than ten years, yet we have not dared to use individual comprehensive income as the basis for taxation. The income tax for profit-making enterprises still implements simplified tax collection methods, failing to levy taxes fully according to the tax law. Now, for a newly created property tax, to suddenly make such a bold attempt, is there any reason not to fail? Even if the government is deeply determined to implement the property tax, the investigation and assessment of the property of more than 2,000 large and small counties and cities and 450 million compatriots nationwide, plus various legal entities, will likely take more than three years (citing the words of Director Wang Fuzhou of the Direct Tax Bureau). The remedy will be too slow to address the urgent need. According to the original intention of member Liu Butong and others, it was nothing more than to liquidate the small number of wealthy individuals who have accumulated private wealth by relying on power and influence, and to confiscate their ill-gotten gains to equalize social wealth and supplement national finances. If this is indeed the case, then the drafting of the bill should concentrate efforts on focusing on the liquidation of the assets of a small number of wealthy individuals as a starting point. How can capital no longer flee? How can the fleeing capital be turned into national use? And how can the fragile domestic production enterprises not accelerate their bankruptcy as a result? These should be the urgent tasks for the members of your Yuan. This council, representing Shanghai, which is the center of industry and commerce in the country and bears more than 50% of the national tax burden, has a relatively comprehensive understanding and its actions have significant implications. As this council is holding its sixth general meeting, regarding your Yuan's decision to levy a temporary property tax at this time, we believe that it would be better to focus on a simple investigation of the assets of the wealthy. And since your Yuan has already established a committee to investigate the assets of wealthy families, if it intensifies its work and devotes all its efforts, it can achieve great results, reap quick benefits, please the public, and alleviate the national crisis. Therefore, after several days of careful deliberation, we have decided to: "Suggest that your Yuan quickly draft a law for levying a special tax on the wealthy and hand it over to the government for earnest implementation, or urge the government to strengthen the implementation of the special levy for relief to enrich the national treasury and meet the urgent needs of suppressing the rebellion. As for the currently under review temporary property tax law, the collection methods are not appropriate, and the implementation will inevitably cause turmoil and hinder legitimate production enterprises. There is nothing worse than this. It should be postponed for further discussion to reassure the public," and other words on file. The reasons are summarized above. We have always admired the members of your Yuan, who all come from the people and represent the consciousness of the entire population. We are confident that you will listen to the voices of the people and graciously adopt our suggestions. The foolish may have a good idea. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration.

### Xu Youzu Accused of Corruption, Suzhou Prosecutor's Office Investigating

### First Maritime Day Celebrated Today with Enthusiasm in Shipping Industry

[Our Newspaper's Report] Today is the first Maritime Day in our country. At 9:00 AM this morning, various shipping-related organizations and groups in the city will hold a commemorative meeting at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on Guangdong Road, sixth floor. Leading officials from various city agencies have been invited to attend the conference. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation will also send representatives to guide the event. In addition, at 8:00 PM this evening, Huang Muzong, director of the Maritime Administration Bureau, will give a broadcast speech on Shanghai Radio Station. All maritime-related agencies, groups, and schools across the country will also hold commemorative meetings simultaneously to celebrate China's first Maritime Day.

Xu Xueyu delivered a speech on the spot, expounding on the four meanings of commemorating Maritime Day: (1) Promoting the connection of various groups in the maritime world, strengthening struggle, and creating a new Chinese shipping industry. (2) Making the government understand the current situation of the Chinese shipping industry and determining the policy of developing the shipping industry. (3) Actively training maritime talents and strengthening business management. (4) Urging the government to pay attention to the shipbuilding industry.

Li Yunliang Publishes Thoughts on Maritime Day

Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the National Federation of Shipping Trade Associations of the Republic of China, published his thoughts on China's Maritime Day, stating: Our country's coastal and inland navigation rights have been infringed upon for a century. In 1942, the unequal treaties were abolished, and navigation rights were recovered. However, some people still do not know what navigation rights are, and even think that it is a matter for shipping companies and has nothing to do with the people. Some even promote the fallacy that "transportation matters more than sovereignty." Our country's shipping industry at this stage feels particularly difficult to operate, especially passenger ships. The number of passengers without tickets is large, and the difficulty of maintaining order is such that even the military and police who enforce the inspection feel棘手. On the occasion of this first Maritime Day, we hope to awaken the government and the people to the reality of the shipping industry. On this festival, we must not only learn the ceremony of the American Maritime Day, but also learn its spirit of rapid progress in shipbuilding.

### "I am a Labor Hero" - Wu Manyou Before and After Being Captured

— Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhou

[Our Newspaper Xi'an 28th Telegram] In the "Liberated Areas" of northern Shaanxi, Wu Manyou is almost universally known. This old man, skilled in farming, was touted by the communists as a "red person." The title of "Labor Hero" forced him to expend even more labor.

A month ago, he concealed his identity, claiming his name was Wang Xicheng. However, when this reporter saw him again this time, the old man himself immediately said, "I am labor hero Wu Manyou, what's there to be afraid of!" As he entered the room, he was covered in sweat. Amidst everyone's polite deference, he took off the military uniform that looked oddly unfitting on him, and wiping away sweat with a red handkerchief in his hand. The military uniform, the red handkerchief, and the man accustomed to wearing farmers' clothes created an amusing picture.

Wu Manyou is now a special figure in the "Patriotic Youth Training Team." He lives in the same room and eats at the same table as the district team leader. It is said that he is now expected to receive a monthly salary equivalent to that of a captain. At the same time, among the prisoners of war, they are looking for his direct nephew, hoping to reunite them. According to him, he saw that "lad" during the confession meeting a few days ago, indeed, he was there.

Speaks a Mouthful of New Terms

Talking about his background, this humorous old man, besides being cheerful, couldn't help but feel emotional. Half a lifetime of vicissitudes, a lifetime of hardship, if old stories are brought up again, this emotion is unavoidable. He speaks with a strong northern Shaanxi accent. "Production," "comrade!" These new terms fill his mouth. He said:

"My old home is Hengshan, living in Yangtai Village, Shiwanzhen. The foundation is quite solid. We cultivated over a hundred "xiang" of land (in northern Shaanxi, land is measured in "xiang," with each "xiang" being about three "mu" of land). In the seventeenth year, northern Shaanxi had a bad year (famine year), and the family couldn't make it. I took my wife and children and fled to Yan'an. In Wu's Zao Yuan, south of Yan'an, we rented some land to cultivate. We are laborers. As long as you put in the effort, you can always harvest more grain. That's how we got by for a few years. There was a lot of production from the land, and although the landlords exploited us, life slowly got better."

Settling Down in Yan'an

"Originally, I thought, when the years are good, I would go back to Hengshan. Later, I got along fairly well in Yan'an, and the land in my old home was also cultivated by others. I took a look, what would I do if I went back? People wanted to divide the land. I sighed, abandoned the old business, and settled down in Yan'an with peace of mind. In the nineteenth year, my wife died. At that time, I was still very poor, had no money to buy medicine, and insisted on delaying her death."

Whenever he mentioned "production" or "labor," Wu Manyou immediately became energetic. From the wrinkles on his face, one could see that his nerves were stimulated. At the same time, in terms of dates and times, he also changed to using terms like "four-one" as a marker.

"I am someone who has suffered poverty. I understand the suffering of poor people. Therefore, I often lend surplus grain to everyone, without adding interest or exploiting. In northern Shaanxi, millet is the best grain. As long as we produce it, and we can't use it all ourselves, you can borrow it, what's there to be afraid of. After the War of Resistance, many refugees fled to northern Shaanxi, from Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, we treat everyone the same. Everyone gets along well. When they build houses and repair villages, we go to help for a couple of days. They say that I unite the poor well. Our crops are cultivated meticulously, they all say that I am good at production.

First Place Hero

In the forty-first year, the "Border Region" wanted to elect "Labor Heroes," investigating layer by layer, reporting to the higher-ups, and I was first. On May 1st of the forty-second year, I became a "Labor Hero." At that time, I was still afraid, didn't know what a "Labor Hero" was. Later, there was a welcome meeting, a total of five people in the entire "Border Region" were elected "Heroes," I was the first place. The "Border Region Government" awarded me a hoe and two shovels. I accepted them and went back to do my farming, working hard to increase production.

In 1943, Wu Manyou was elected as a member of the Yan'an City Council. When the reporter went to Yan'an last year, he saw his portrait hung on the wall with Zhu and Mao in the council. In the records of the council, his proposals were all considered important resolutions, such as "Cultivating Three Remaining One," "Labor Exchange Team," "Intensive Cultivation"... etc., in the process of "Increasing Production," they were all cited as slogans by the communists. Now, when talking to him about these things again, he still remembers them clearly, even the years and months, especially when talking about his proposal of "The Mare Should Not Support a Tall Husband Case." He smiled and said, "Because the mare has a foal, the chief doesn't feed the horse well, and blinds the foal too. I proposed this case entirely for the sake of the people. I am a commoner, of course I love the common people. I won't say anything to the public, but I truly put in effort for the people!"

Arrested in Binzhou

"Last December, I joined the supply station and was assigned to work in the health department of the Second Column. Later, I was assigned to the Sixth Column as the deputy captain of the stretcher team. Shit! What's there to be afraid of, I'm already a labor hero, so just be a deputy captain! In total, I led more than two hundred laborers, to Shibao, out of Huanglong Mountain, and was captured in Binzhou!"

Wu Manyou has two "lads," the older one is called Wu Zhongfu, 25 years old, now farming at home in Yan'an, the younger one is 20 years old this year, called Zhongguo. He joined the army the year before last, initially as a combatant, later as a "surveyor." Wu Manyou said, "The younger one has read books for a couple of days." Talking about them, although he said, "I don't miss them, thinking, 'shit,' they have all married wives and have two daughters, what's there to miss!" But from his face, one could see the deep affection of a parent for his children. This old man is still deeply missing his sons who are far away across the mountains.

Doesn't Want a Wife

The reporter asked about his thoughts on the lives of the people in Guanzhong. He immediately praised them, "It's good here, the land is better than in northern Shaanxi, the soil color is good, and the people are also free and easy, there are no worries when speaking. In northern Shaanxi, if there is a relationship, you have to look at the person. Actually, the government doesn't beat or scold, it's just that 'rectification' is bad!" As for the future, Wu Manyou said, "As long as there is land, what's there to be afraid of! I can labor for the government!" A training officer next to him said to find him a wife, so he could settle down in Guanzhong. He immediately laughed and shouted, "No, no, I'm already fifty-five years old, why would I want a wife?"

Expert Li Ruohai

General Li Ruohai, who manages the youth training headquarters, can be said to be an expert in training communists. He graduated from the fourth class of the military academy and started working on conversion in the "Labor Camp" in Xi'an. Decades of experience have enriched his life. When he talked to reporters about his experience, he only said one thing is "patience," and the other is "reason." As long as you can convince them, there is only one truth. As for the future of the team members, according to him, the record for the past two years is that more than 80% are transferred to the National Army, pointing their guns outwards, letting them atone for their sins on the battlefield. Higher-level personnel, after conversion, are either sent away with compensation, or assigned work in the rear after considering the situation.

Claims to be Wang Xicheng

The story of how Wu Manyou was discovered is very interesting. When the training team instructors were having individual conversations with the newly admitted team members, Wu Manyou claimed to be Wang Xicheng, from Luochuan, a squad leader in the laborer team. However, from his expression, the instructors judged that he was definitely not a squad leader, but possibly a mid-level "cadre." Later, some old team members came to report, saying that he looked like the "Hero" Wu Manyou. After several conversations, he still dodged and was vague, until early June, when he was moved by the life in the team and automatically freed himself from the communist propaganda, he admitted everything!

General Hu Zongnan summoned him to the residence of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, Xiaoyan Pagoda, on the evening of June 4th. But Wu Manyou again denied that he was Wu Manyou, saying that he was squad leader Wang Xicheng. General Hu did not delve into this, but as soon as he left the room, Mr. Hu told the senior subordinates of the Pacification Headquarters that he was Wu Manyou, because as soon as he sat on the sofa, he crossed his legs, with a calm and composed manner, which was something that a squad leader would never have. Now, when everyone talks about these things, the old man blushes and smiles sheepishly, saying, "I was too naughty."

Loud Appeal

From a landlord to a tenant farmer, then becoming a "hero" and now, Wu Manyou's path has been long and tortuous, full of wind and rain. The communists used honors, hoes, a cow... to make him an idol, using his appeal to successfully collect 160,000 to 200,000 "shi" of "patriotic public grain" from northern Shaanxi every year. Now, this simple villager is moved again by the National Army's generosity and material enjoyment. In addition to inviting him to give speeches, the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters is also preparing to print pamphlets for him. At the "Confession Meeting" on June 15th, he called on everyone to show their conscience and reveal their identities... His voice has become a loud appeal again in the training team.

Isn't Wu Manyou a good mirror to look at this era, to look at the achievements of the National Army's conversion work?

### Residents of Jingzhou Township, Jixi, Carry Out the Return to Changhua Movement

[Our Newspaper Changhua 1st Telegram] Jingzhou Township, currently under the jurisdiction of Jixi County, Anhui, is located west of Changhua (Zhejiang) and southeast of Jixi (Anhui), surrounded by towering mountains and lush greenery, known as a paradise. Since our country established provinces and counties in the Qin Dynasty, it has been under the jurisdiction of Changhua County, Zhejiang. The township has a population of more than 8,000 people, who are diligent in farming and weaving, and live in peace. It was not until the 20th year of the Republic of China that the township was forcibly assigned to Jixi County due to personnel relations. However, the township is hundreds of miles away from the Jixi county seat, with rugged mountain roads. Government orders cannot reach it and the problem of public security is even more difficult to address. Therefore, it has become a land beyond the reach of the law. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China, it was spied on by the communists and repeatedly disturbed. In the New Year of the following year, it was occupied as a base, and activities were openly carried out. Since then, the township has been under the red terror, and has been subjected to tragic massacres and liquidations. Recently, it was learned that all the residents of the township are unable to work during the day and sleep at night, and are unable to bear the pain. They are also unwilling to be trapped in the township as a land without governance for a long time. Therefore, last month, they rose up to take self-rescue actions for the township. They felt that it was most reasonable and convenient for the township to return to Changhua in terms of geographical situation, customs, habits, government orders, and public security. Based on this reason, they launched the "Jingzhou Return to Changhua Movement" and appointed Hu Huatao, Hu Zhenwu, etc. to organize the "Jingzhou Return to Changhua Movement Committee," and set up an office in Bainiu Town, Changhua. They are now actively carrying out applications to the central government and relevant agencies in the province and county, and distributing telegrams on their behalf. (Telegram omitted)

At present, many residents of the township have moved to Changhua due to the inability to live in peace. It is also learned that if their application for the return of Jingzhou Township to Changhua is not approved, they will gather all the residents of the township to petition the central government, and will not give up until they achieve their goal.

### Unprecedented Advertisement - Irish Literary Maverick George Bernard Shaw Cooperates with Pan American Airlines

[Our Newspaper Report] The reporter recently learned from the Pan American Airlines office here that Irish literary maverick George Bernard Shaw recently voluntarily revised an advertisement for the company's U.S. to Ireland route. This is the first time in Shaw's life that he has cooperated with the business community, which Pan American Airlines regards as an supreme honor. The advertisement introduces the scenery of Ireland, and Shaw personally wrote the following words:

"Ireland is wonderfully different,

Ireland's skies are different,

Ireland's air is different,

Living in the Irish climate for two years can turn the most stubborn and slow-witted minds into soft and agile ones."

Pan American initially intended to quote Shaw's words from a travel guide published in Ireland after the war, which read: "I am in paradise in Ireland. In such an infinitely quiet place, one cannot work, and I hope that we will not have to work in heaven." Pan American Airlines inquired about Shaw's consent for this, and Shaw replied that he had never said such a thing, so he changed and wrote the aforementioned sentence, and revised other words in the advertisement. Shaw was willing to write for Pan American Airlines for free entirely based on his patriotism, because he believed that this would encourage Americans to travel to Ireland and increase the country's foreign exchange income.

### From Grain Barn to Vast Expanse of Water: The Sorrowful Southern County Submerged by Continuous Rain

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Huang Chao-ru

[Dispatch from Changsha, This Newspaper, 1st] Nan County is located in the heart of Dongting Lake, with a diameter of less than a hundred li. The county's total cultivated area is about 800,000 mu, with a population of over 280,000. Situated by the lake, it is considered the smallest and youngest county. The entire county consists of polder fields (垸田), with no high ground. Although it lacks famous mountains and clear waters, every spring and summer, the weeping willows along the banks and the seedlings in the polders transform Nan County into a beautiful green world. By early autumn, one sees only golden fields, and the granaries are full. Therefore, outsiders call it a "grain barn."

Moment of Great Prosperity Twenty Years Ago

Indeed, Nan County experienced a period of great prosperity over twenty years ago. At that time, all the polder fields were newly silted alluvial land, with fertile soil and relatively high elevation, reducing the threat of floods. Consequently, the yield was extremely abundant, mainly grain and cotton, with significant production of various other coarse grains. Due to the abundance of grain, supplementary industries such as pig, sheep, chicken, and duck farming were also quite developed. Furthermore, there was a large Datong Lake – an inner lake of Dongting Lake – producing approximately 100,000 dan of fish annually. Thus, the elegant name of "land of fish and rice" was bestowed upon Nan County.

Only Fear of Squeezing the Milk from a Fat Sheep

Although Nan County is a small county, it made a significant contribution to the nation during the long periods of the Eight-Year War of Resistance and the Three-Year Civil War. Since the implementation of the conscription system, it has never failed to meet its quota. The land tax burden was particularly heavy, with annual real tax collections reaching over 600,000 shi, accounting for one-thirteenth of the entire Hunan province, even more than the entire Guangxi province. The people of Nan County could barely breathe under the burden of land taxes. However, they always endured, gritted their teeth, and waited for the mercy of heaven to grant them a good harvest, which is akin to squeezing as much milk as possible from a fat sheep. As long as the sheep can grow fat. If there is not enough nutritious feed for the sheep and only dry grass is given to it to satisfy its hunger, and you still squeeze milk from it, then this sheep will only die of exhaustion.

Flooded Farmlands Increase Yearly

Nan County has crisscrossing rivers, which were previously considered convenient for irrigation. However, in recent years, the riverbed has gradually silted up as the river water carries silt downstream. The elevation within the polders has gradually lowered, and the area of flooded farmlands has increased year by year. In the past, this area was occupied by the enemy three times. Combined with the impact of an excessively heavy burden, its vitality was exhausted, and it lacked the capacity to build water conservancy projects. Although it repeatedly appealed to the government, requesting a little fresh grass feed for this sold sheep and providing relief, the sheep cried itself hoarse, but the listener remained unmoved. Therefore, the polder fields of Nan County now completely rely on the mercy of heaven. During spring droughts, there is no water for transplanting rice seedlings; during summer rains, the area turns into a swamp. It is no longer the worry-free grain barn of the past.

Accumulated Water in the Polders Cannot Be Drained

Since the beginning of spring this year, continuous rain has persisted for months. The accumulated water in the polders cannot be drained, and the fields and house foundations have become a vast expanse of water. The situation of families floating with their belongings is exceptionally miserable. This year, this area not only suffered from floods but also experienced an unprecedented windstorm. The disaster area is vast, and the losses are heavy. It is pitiful that the surviving people have already lost everything they have. According to county government statistics, the flooded and wind-damaged area covers over 560,000 mu, with over 150,000 people affected. Over 7,900 houses were damaged or collapsed due to the wind and flood, and 168 boats were sunk or damaged.

Upstream Mountain Torrent Outburst Is Feared

Although the continuous rain has stopped, the accumulated water still cannot be drained, and late rice still cannot be replanted. Moreover, there is an even more worrying matter that concerns everyone. During the last spring rain disaster, the upstream mountain torrents did not yet erupt. Considering the thick snow accumulation from last winter, there may still be a mountain torrent disaster this summer. If unfortunately followed by another mountain torrent outburst, then this grain barn in Dongting Lake will be in danger of being completely destroyed. The Chinese people rely on the bodhisattva for protection. Other than that, they seem helpless. Now, the farmers by the lake are burning incense and praying that there will be no more floods. However, the bodhisattva is ultimately an elusive figure. Whether it is efficacious is truly only "heaven knows!"

### Central Bank of China (CBC) Monitors Price Fluctuations in July; Decides to Implement Surprise Inspections; Transfer Application Forms Cannot Be Used by Customers

To cooperate with the municipal authorities in stabilizing prices and combating speculation, the Shanghai Financial Administration (SFA) has, since June 20th, dispatched personnel in batches to the check clearing house to inspect large-value check exchanges. Based on this information, they went to various exchange firms to investigate relevant companies and businesses, and the preliminary investigation has been completed. The SFA has submitted the inspection results to the Shanghai Municipal Government for joint investigation to determine whether these companies and businesses are genuine merchants and whether the purpose of issuing large-value checks is legitimate. If any violations or speculative activities are discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law. Furthermore, the SFA has previously issued a strict ban on customers issuing bad checks. In addition to the customers who issued bad checks in the past being punished separately by the SFA and reported to the authorities by various firms in accordance with the law, according to the SFA's inspection statistics, approximately 20 clients of various firms had insufficient funds or overdrawn accounts in June, resulting in bounced checks. The SFA has instructed the various firms to cease business with these clients and to report them directly to the court in accordance with the law to rectify the situation. It is now learned that with the end of the semi-annual settlement period at the end of June, the SFA, in order to strengthen the inspection of firms and prevent market fluctuations, has, in addition to continuing to cooperate with the municipal government in investigating companies and businesses, borrowed personnel from the Central Bank of China to conduct surprise inspections of various firms starting from July 3rd. Thirty firms are inspected daily. In addition, it has been ordered that transfer application forms should be limited to inter-bank use and should not be used at the request of customers to reduce the speed of currency circulation. The SFA has instructed the three industry associations of banking, money, and trust companies to inform various firms to strictly comply.

### Unstable Domestic Situation Affects New Exchange Settlement Method

More than a month has passed since the announcement of the new exchange settlement method. Exports have indeed been promoted, and the quantity of exports has also increased. However, the actual situation still does not meet expectations. (1) Export smuggling is still rampant; (2) Import and export revenues and expenditures still cannot be balanced; (3) Overseas remittances still cannot be attracted. The reason for this is entirely due to the fact that the market price of the exchange settlement certificate is far from the black market exchange rate, and the gap often remains above two-fifths, resulting in the above three phenomena. The formation of this phenomenon is due to the unstable domestic situation and the failure of the economic situation to improve. Some people believe that the new exchange settlement method should be re-examined and properly applied in order to change the situation.

### Private Trade with Japan: Export Guarantee Measures

Tang Jusheng Explains Intended Restrictions, Difficult to Accept Alternative Proposals

The Chinese delegation to Japan previously stipulated that when private traders negotiate purchase contracts with Japanese merchants, they should first prepare export materials of equal value to the imported goods. After investigation and verification by the China Trust Bureau, a guarantee would be issued. The traders believed that this measure would lead to the stagnation of funds and sent representatives back to China to request the government to change it. According to Tang Jusheng, the commercial commissioner of the delegation, this restriction is intended to maintain the credit of the Chinese government and merchants abroad in order to avoid any possibility of forming debt. If goods are not exchanged for money, they must be exchanged for materials. This is a clear principle. Moreover, the current trade between merchants and Japan is guaranteed by the government through bookkeeping. If they form debt, wouldn't the government have to repay it on their behalf? Therefore, the government finds it difficult to accept the proposed changes.

### This Month's Coal Ration Price

Under Review, Announcement Scheduled for the 5th

It is reported that this month's coal ration price will inevitably increase due to the soaring prices of goods in mining areas. For example, the price of flour in June increased by 35% compared to May. Hardware materials and kiln wood must be purchased with foreign exchange, and the sum of the official exchange rate and the transaction price of the exchange settlement certificate must also be more than 2.4 million. Transportation costs have increased by approximately 35%, and other miscellaneous expenses have increased by approximately 20%. A portion of wages must be increased by 100% according to the cost of living index.

According to the Fuel Management Committee, based on the above increase rates, the price of rationed coal for this month must be increased by at least 150%. Last month's ration price was 12.55 million, which means an increase of one and a half times. Even then, it would still be half cheaper than the current black market price of coal. The committee is confident that the supply of coal in this city will not be scarce. However, the prices for various coal rations for this month are still under review and will be officially announced on the 5th.

### Credit Cooperatives' "Love Affair Check," Please Change the Interpretation

[Quick Dispatch from Nanjing] The issue of credit cooperatives not being able to be the payers of checks has aroused unanimous opposition from credit cooperatives across the country. It is heard that the national credit cooperative industry has established the National Credit Cooperative Federation. They all believe that this measure by the Ministry of Finance violates the spirit of the Constitution and undermines the cooperative cause. They will issue a declaration appealing to the whole country, requesting justice. Regarding the dispute over the negotiable instruments law, it is heard that the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Credit Cooperative Federation have detailed their reasons and submitted a request to the Judicial Yuan for a change in interpretation.

### Jiangzhe Spring Cocoon Purchase Ends

Raw Silk Processing Fee Loan of 210 Million First

The purchase of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year has ended. The Silk Guidance Association is currently compiling the cocoon purchase reports from the two provinces and submitting them to the Joint Treasury and the relevant authorities for review. At the same time, the Agricultural Bank will start to approve raw silk processing fees for manufacturers who have already completed their work next week, first approving 210 million per dan. The remaining loan amount will be fully calculated when it is submitted. The number of loan quotas per dan will be determined by the rise and fall of the price index.

### Increase in Gasoline Ration

Gasoline is the main raw material used by the rubber industry to dissolve and mix rubber. The gasoline required by the rubber industry in this city is supplied by Asia, Mobil, Texaco, and China Petroleum Company. According to the investigation, each ton of rubber requires 170 gallons of gasoline. The actual ration was reduced to 120 gallons. After the establishment of the City Gasoline Distribution Committee last month, it was further reduced by 60%, allowing 72 gallons of gasoline per ton of rubber. However, due to various excuses by oil merchants, the ration in May was extremely small, and there was none in June. If this continues, the industry will not be able to survive. Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Supervisory and Management Office of the National Economic Council, requesting them to forward it to the City Gasoline Distribution Committee to re-examine the gasoline required by the industry, maintain the minimum usage originally approved by the Industrial Assistance Office, and hope that it can be evenly distributed with gasoline for transportation to maintain production.

### Duplicate Copies of Tobacco Leaf Export Permits Can Be Issued Directly by Customs

The Tobacco Leaf Commercial Association previously requested the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance to consult the Customs Administration to order the Jianghai Customs to issue duplicate copies of export permits for tobacco leaf exports to be used as proof of application for tax refunds to the tax bureau. It is now learned that the Tax Affairs Department has transferred the request of the industry association to the Customs Administration for a reply and stated that the case belongs to the customs's signing of documents for merchants and should be handled by the merchant directly requesting the export customs to sign and issue them for use in accordance with the regulations of the Customs Administration. Therefore, in the future, tobacco leaf export sales, tobacco merchants can ask the association to prepare a document and directly request the Jianghai Customs to issue duplicate copies of export permits to obtain tax refunds and avoid complicated procedures.

### Tung Oil Export to the U.S. Shows Signs of Hope; My Commercial Counselor to the U.S. Concludes Negotiations; U.S. Cancels Anti-Dumping Duties and Guarantees

[Dispatch from Washington, This Newspaper] The United States' tung oil imports mainly come from China, and China's tung oil exports are mainly to the United States. Foreign exchange earnings last year reached approximately 30 million U.S. dollars. Previously, due to the sharp drop in tung oil prices in the United States, the Tung Oil Producers Association of that country believed that this was due to China's dumping of tung oil to the United States and formally requested the U.S. government to impose anti-dumping duties on China's tung oil to resist it. If this becomes a reality, China's tung oil exports will be greatly affected. The U.S. Customs's order to pay guarantees for tung oil imports from China has also caused China's tung oil exports to decrease significantly. The Chinese government and tung oil exporters are very anxious about this. My country's commercial counselor's office in the United States also believes that this matter is of great importance and specially negotiated or explained with the various departments of the U.S. Foreign, Treasury, Agriculture and Commerce Departments. However, this matter involves many issues. In addition to price, it is also related to the U.S. party election. The office negotiated with the U.S. government on the one hand, contacted tung oil consumers who opposed taxation on the other hand, and requested legislators who opposed taxation to use their political skills to assist from the side. It is now learned that the U.S. government has rejected this anti-dumping request and canceled the previous customs's method of requiring guarantees for tung oil imports from China.

### Cigarettes Continue to Decline

Yesterday, the cigarette market continued to decline because of tight money and rising overnight interest rates.

The remaining Chinese and foreign cigarettes also continued to decline, from 56,000 to 340,000 yuan. However, Five-Star Brandy and Sailor and Cat strip cigarettes improved by 345 million yuan.

### Soap Market Slightly Weak

The daily necessities soap market was stable at the initial opening. Halfway through, sales at the main street shops were still smooth, and the search purchases were not lonely. The owners of the goods were reluctant to sell lightly because the goods dispatched by various factories were not many, and the market once rose. However, those with tight money generally sought to sell goods, and with more sellers, the market became sluggish. Guben brand and Arrow brand soaps ultimately fell back by 300,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Guanghua soap and Lever soap improved by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan because they were sold better. The remainder all declined. The match market also trended weak, and transactions became rare. The Beautiful Phoenix brand and the Phoenix brand all slightly declined by 23 million yuan.

### Philippine Red Sox Baseball Team Wins 5-0 Against China, Red Sox Second Game Today Against All-Star Team at American School

[Our Dispatch] In the Sino-Philippine Baseball Friendship Games, held at the racecourse yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Manila Red Sox team defeated the home team China by a score of 5-0 in front of hundreds of Chinese and foreign dignitaries. Before the game, the Chinese team presented a banner as a souvenir. Mayor Wu could not attend due to official business and was replaced by Zhang Bide, the head of the municipal government's public relations section, who threw the ball to Filipino Vice Consul Garcia to express welcome to the sports ambassador.

Elusive Red Sox Score

The battle began with Zhang Bide and Garcia's throw and catch. China yielded, and the visiting team attacked first. Lei Mengdu reached first base with a bunt, and advanced to second base thanks to Reid's base hit. Parres hit an extremely swift and low ball, which was caught by shortstop Liang Yousheng with an excellent play. He quickly threw to second base, and then to first base, resulting in a double play. However, Lei Mengdu stole a point due to a mistake by catcher He Jinben. China countered, but Red Sox A. Ocena's pitching, spinning left and right, was elusive and unpredictable. However, Liang Wenyi, He Jingui, and Liang Youwen were able to barely hit the ball, but unfortunately, they were too soft and did not gain anything. In the second, third, and fourth innings, both sides were heavily guarded, and there were no opportunities to get on base.

Two to Zero

In the fifth inning, Red Sox Xiao Ocena got on base with a base hit, and Le Mosi hit a double, Xiao Ocena rushed back to home plate, but was killed by the He brothers with lightning speed. A. Ocena attacked, Le Mishi took the opportunity to score a point, making it two to zero. China's Liang Yousheng and Bao Guanda were eliminated one after another. Although He Jinben advanced to third base due to a technical foul by the Philippine side, the hope of scoring was dashed because Yu Chang was struck out.

In the sixth inning, Reid was thrown out by Yu Changluan, Parres was caught by Zhong Baoluo, and Rosa was forced out by Liang Yousheng. China was three up and three down.

Losing Three Points in a Row

In the final inning, the Chinese defense was slightly relaxed, and Gu Angka, Le Moshi, and Xiao Ocena scored three points in succession. The counterattack was unsuccessful, and they lost 0-5. The scores of each inning are as follows:

Showboating

Overall, the Red Sox's defensive skills can be considered tight, but their offense does not have any special strengths. Moreover, because they are a semi-professional team, they often show exaggerated performances. Such performances are understandable in professional games to attract audiences, but in international competitions to promote friendship and connect feelings, they violate the spirit of sports and run counter to the original purpose. It is hoped that the sports ambassador will pay attention to this.

All-Stars Face Off

The Red Sox's second game is scheduled for 3:00 PM today at the American School on Hengshan Road, where they will meet the China All-Star team, which gathers the essence of Chinese and foreign athletes from Beijing and Shanghai. The All-Star team has strong players such as China's Yu Changluan, Liang Youyi, and Air Force Mike Yilai, and their strength is more powerful than the Chinese team, which can pose a greater threat to the visiting team. Fans who want to admire the skills of the Red Sox can contact the Shanghai Amateur Sports Association for tickets.

Infant Boy Dies After Birth; Father Writes to Medical Community for Research
To all doctors and staff at Nanjing Central Hospital and doctors and nurses at hospitals across the country:

For days, newspapers have been reporting on the strange case of a deformed baby at Nanjing Central Hospital. Unfortunately, my son, Shengzu, died tragically at 2:55 AM on the 24th due to excessive stomach bleeding. In my sorrow, I have written down the points worth studying for doctors to research.

After my son's death, Dr. Xu performed an autopsy and concluded that the cause of death was stomach bleeding. Dr. Xu said, "The cause of the stomach bleeding was that after the surgery, he stopped eating, and the stomach lining rubbed against itself, causing the stomach wall to be injured, leading to excessive bleeding and death." This statement is worth studying to clarify responsibility. Today's newspapers reported that it was a stomach ulcer, which I believe is a misreport by the reporter. Before my son was admitted to the hospital, he was no different from a normal child. The X-ray examination did not reveal any other changes in his stomach. How could he have stomach ulcers? Moreover, from the surgery to his last breath, his temperature was normal, and his mind was clear. Whether this bleeding was related to the gastric lavage surgery is also a major cause of death and should be studied.

As my son gradually slipped into a coma, my wife urgently asked the nurse to call a doctor, but the nurse was annoyed, and the doctor delayed the consultation for three hours, and it was too late to save him. Stomach bleeding is not incurable in the early stages. The nurse's obstruction and the doctor's delay are to blame!

During the autopsy, there was a fist-sized black blood clot inside the incision line, witnessed by my relative Sun Yusu. I don't know if this blood is related to my son's death. I hope the doctors will study it.

Finally, I am grateful to Miss Yao of the Social Service Department of Central Hospital for granting a 30% discount on the payment. Thank you.

He Weiwen from Wujin, respectfully, 37.6, 25, under the lamp

The Misfortune of Works in "Free Talk" Shuang Lu
The British publication "New Writing," edited by John Lehmann, contains many good articles, especially those introducing works from the European continent, which are valuable. Europe is in suffering, and we only hear news of their material shortages. Who pays attention to their spiritual achievements?

The writer saw the latest issue of "New Writing," Volume 33, which includes Gide's notes, Paul Valéry's essays, and a short story by Italian writer Antonio Bottoni, "The Man Who Escaped from the Moon," which is also a good piece.

But what makes me most emotional is the editor Lehmann's preface at the beginning of the volume, which includes this passage: "The purpose of 'New Writing' is not only to provide works by modern European writers, but also to introduce things by English writers overseas, and American writers are no exception. During the war, our opportunities were few, but we still overcame difficulties and occasionally published novels, poems, and essays by outstanding people from France, Greece, and Czechoslovakia. There are not many writers from the autonomous regions... However, the appearance of American works is really rare, although the editor is very welcome to contribute. But this is just our unrequited love, or is it because the editors of American magazines are standing in our way, waving stacks of American dollar bills to confuse people?..."

Lehmann's emotion is a bit like a poor man sighing. In fact, the standard of "New Writing" is much higher than that of general American publications. Lehmann does not particularly value American works, but for the sake of the "colorful" content of the publication, he wants to invite writers from across the Atlantic to "join in the grand event." However, it is not possible. American famous writers do not lack gold pounds, but British famous writers lack dollars, such as Shaw, in addition to submitting short letters to the Times letter column, a short article must also be published in the United States. How great is the magic of American dollar bills?

American writers are too tempted by money, and most of their works are decadent. The most obvious phenomenon is the popularity of vulgar love stories and absurd detective novels. Although the printing is beautiful and the illustrations are colorful, what relationship do they have with real life?

In politics, like England and France, they worship under the skirts of the "beauty," but in intellectual circles, the evaluation of the "beauty" is different. American publishers are willing to pay high prices, but they want you to cater to their low tastes. But what about the Chinese publishing industry? Not to mention the taste, but they do everything possible to be harsh on writers, resulting in a group of writing slaves living a half-dead life. Alas!

On Appropriateness Jin Jin
To explain this topic, it is useful to use clothing as a metaphor. It is said that there are master tailors who can maximize the beauty of the physique when making clothes, such as broad shoulders, tall stature, etc., while minimizing various flaws, such as flat chest, protruding abdomen, etc. I have also heard that fancy clothing stores overseas make a wire hanger according to the dimensions of each part of the human body, and sew according to this hanger. Naturally, it will fit perfectly when worn.

But such appropriateness is often very difficult. Not only must a lot of effort be spent on sewing, but also attention must be paid to various details. I recently made a set of clothes, and after modifying it horizontally and vertically, I still couldn't be satisfied. Broadly speaking, it is really difficult to make any person or thing in the world match their identity or achieve perfection. An actor who deliberately imitates the appearance of a worker may forget to apply makeup to his snow-white hands.

Similar situations, even the emperor of Abyssinia, were considered regrettable by foreign reporters. An American writer quoted an anecdote about Emperor Haile Selassie in a magazine published in December 1947: Emperor Haile Selassie visited England in 1936. The emperor sat high in an open-top carriage, nodding and smiling to the thousands of Londoners cheering along the way. He suddenly unexpectedly flicked his snot into the air, which embarrassed the British reception staff who were attending the emperor.

The implication is that the emperor should be appropriate to the emperor's identity. His act of flicking his snot is still cited as conversation material eleven or twelve years later.

Originally, the habits of the people of Abyssinia may not be consistent with those of the British and Americans. We cannot criticize the emperor for this. The British and Americans also have their own cumbersome etiquette. There are thick books dedicated to "etiquette." Indeed, the British and Americans' pursuit of "appropriateness" and "meticulousness" in science and efficiency can make people admire them.

Looking back at the Chinese, they are much more lenient about everything. Most of what we see and hear is "not seeking thorough understanding," "just fulfilling the responsibility," and "careless." The word "appropriateness" has mostly been erased from the dictionary, and overemphasizing appropriateness seems close to being demanding. Indeed, in these years, our lives are very busy, and even if we want to "nitpick," we hardly have the leisure to "split hairs."

Comparison of Official Salaries Between China and the United States Yi Yun
The current official salary table of the United States federal government was revised by the government after World War II when prices rose sharply. The salary amounts are calculated on an annual basis. The table is divided into four categories: (1) Professional category: All engineers, technicians, doctors, etc. are included. (2) Semi-professional category: All surveyors, draftsmen, supervisors, and nurses, etc. are included. (3) Literary, medical, financial, and management category: All non-technical personnel who handle typing, receiving and sending, managing files, literary, medical, administrative, accounting, and administrative management are included. (4) Technician and security category: All drivers, electricians, gate guards, guards, etc. are included. The salary for the first category is divided into eight levels. The lowest salary for the initial level is $2,644.80, and the highest salary is $3,397.20. If promoted to the highest level, it is $9,975.00 to $10,000.00. The salary for the second category is also divided into eight levels. The lowest salary for the initial level is $1,690.00, and the highest salary is $2,093.04. If promoted to the highest level, it is $3,397.20 to $4,149.60. The salary for the third category is divided into fifteen levels. The lowest salary for the initial level is $1,756.00, and the highest salary is $2,168.28. If promoted to the highest level, it is the same as the first category. The salary for the fourth category is divided into ten levels. The lowest salary for the initial level is $1,080.00, and the highest salary is $1,402.00. If promoted to the highest level, it is $3,648.00 to $4,400.40. According to the above salary amounts, the first category has the most initial pay, followed by the third category, and the salaries for these two categories are the same when promoted to the highest level. The fourth category has the least initial pay. The lowest salary is only $1,080.00, which is less than half of the initial lowest salary of $2,644.80 for the first category. It can be seen that the status of gate guards and mechanics is humble, and they cannot be compared with professional personnel who cannot be employed without a university degree. (The United States stipulates that the first category must have a university degree. If they have a master's or doctoral degree, they can receive a higher salary when they are first assigned.)

Now, let's compare our country's current official salary table with that of the United States. The salary for the first level of appointment in our country (that is, the highest salary for appointment) is a monthly salary of 200 yuan, which is 19.74 million legal currency based on the June cost of living index of 420,000 times in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The salary for the first level of recommendation is a monthly salary of 400 yuan, which is 28.14 million legal currency based on the above cost of living index. The salary for the first level of simple appointment is a monthly salary of 680 yuan, which is 39.9 million legal currency based on the above cost of living index. If we overestimate our strength and compare the highest salary of simple appointment with the highest salary of the first and third categories in the United States, the situation is as follows:

(1) The highest monthly salary for simple appointment in our country is 680 yuan - calculated at 420,000 times, it is 39.9 million yuan - converted to US dollars at the official price of 459.780, it is only more than 86 yuan.

(2) The highest annual salary for the first and third categories in the United States is 10,000 US dollars - equivalent to a monthly salary of more than 833 US dollars, which is about 382.99 million legal currency when converted at the official price of 459.780.

Looking at the above situation, we can see that according to this comparison, it is less than one-tenth. It is too unrealistic to compare with them. We can only lower our standards and compare with their fourth category of gate guards and mechanics. The result is as follows:

(1) The initial minimum annual salary for gate guards and mechanics in the United States is 1,080 US dollars, equivalent to a monthly salary of 90 US dollars - converted to legal currency at the above official price, it is about a monthly salary of more than 41.3 million yuan.

(2) The highest monthly salary for simple appointment in our country is only more than 39 million yuan, which is inferior to them. If compared with the highest monthly salary of more than 28 million yuan for recommendation, it is even more unreachable. If compared with the highest monthly salary of more than 19 million yuan for appointment, it is less than half.

According to the United States, civil servants still feel that their treatment is meager, far less than the income of employees in private enterprises, so it is no wonder that civil servants in our country are so poor that they commit suicide.

"Medicine" and Plum Juice Yu Mojun
In summer, farmers drink cold water to quench their thirst, while urban people have the blessings of eating watermelon, drinking soda or Coca-Cola, and tasting ice cream. There is also a kind of drink called plum juice, which is priced by the cup and can be seen everywhere, and is always advertised as Beijing plum juice, because the one made in Beijing is the best. It is not easy to verify who invented this soup, but it is really "ancient."

According to today's plum juice, it is the ancient "medicine" (qu shang). Opening the "Rites of Zhou," whether it is "four drinks" or "six drinks," there is "medicine." "Rites of Zhou, Heavenly Official, Wine Administration" says: "Distinguish the materials of four drinks, the second is 'medicine.'" The annotation says, "Liqueur is turbid, brewed to make fine wine, so it is a little clearer." According to "Yu Pian," fine wine is clear wine. According to this, "medicine" is today's inlaid wine, such as Zhuangyuanhong inlaid with bamboo leaf green, which is wine and not a summer drink.

Also according to "Rites of Zhou": "Jiang Ren is in charge of six drinks," and the fifth is "medicine." Zheng Zhu thinks that plum sauce can generate fluid and quench thirst, which is the beginning of today's plum juice. However, plum sauce is too thick and greasy, so there is "yi." There is the sentence "jiang yi shui yi lan" in "Li Ji Nei Ze"; the note says that yi is plum syrup. According to the fact that syrup is much thinner than sauce, the making of "yi" must use "medicine" as the raw material, and then add water without a doubt, which is today's plum juice.

A Portrait of a Thief Chen Xiang
"That's a terribly bad portrait, I refuse to pay." After making this harsh judgment, Mr. Allie-Maire Keeling turned and left the young Hungarian painter Arpad Debesy's studio.

Weeks of time were wasted, and the five hundred yuan fee was lost. Sabisi painfully remembered that this rich man was too busy to allow him to paint his face only three times, so the entire portrait was almost entirely painted from memory. Still, it was very similar.

"Please stay a moment!" he shouted, "Would you write me a letter saying: You refuse to accept this portrait because it doesn't look like you?" The rich man did not expect to get away so easily, so he readily agreed.

Months later, the "Hungarian Painters Association" held an exhibition in the art gallery of the Hungarian capital. Shortly after the opening, Keeling's phone rang. Within half an hour, he appeared at the gallery and went straight to the side where Sabisi's works were displayed. There was the portrait he had refused to accept.

At a glance, his face turned purple. He stormed into the gallery manager's office, demanding that the portrait be removed immediately. The manager calmly explained that all the works were contracted to be exhibited in the gallery for a full six weeks.

"But this will make me the laughingstock of the whole capital," Keeling roared angrily, "This is a public insult, I'm going to sue."

"Wait a minute," the manager warned, taking out the letter Keeling had written at Sabisi's request. "You yourself admitted that the painting doesn't look like you," he said coldly, "so you have no right to interfere with its disposal."

In despair, Keeling had to pay to buy the book. At this time, he realized that the price was ten times the original. In order to maintain his reputation, Keeling painfully signed a five thousand yuan check.

Sabisi used a little trick to not only sell the portrait that was rejected for alimony back to the person who commissioned it, but also to vent his anger. Originally, when exhibiting, he also added such a title to the painting - "Portrait of a Thief".

The examination system has a long history and has an important relationship with politics, culture, and society. Throughout the dynasties, it has been called "a great ceremony for selecting talents," and has been taken extremely seriously. However, there has never been a government agency specifically responsible for this matter, which is surprising. It has existed since the establishment of the "Examination Yuan" by the national government according to the intention of the five-power constitution.

According to "a great ceremony for selecting talents," the scale of the Tang Dynasty was roughly complete, and the Song Dynasty repeatedly repaired it. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, the palace examination, the township examination, the provincial examination, and the annual examination, as well as the进士, the 举人, the 買生, the 生員, were divided into grades, and the examination halls and fame were fully prepared. However, at that time, the Ministry of Rites was the most closely related to the examination among the six ministries of the government. The Ministry of Rites was responsible for ceremonies, and managed court meetings, sacrifices, ancestral halls, and even the imperial tombs and the custody of official seals. Although it managed the affairs of the examination halls, its name did not match the reality. Also, the origin of the examination was not correct. The Tang History can be verified. In March of the twenty-fourth year of Kaiyuan, "The servant of the Ministry of Rites was ordered to be in charge of the examination." Because a former Ministry of Civil Service personnel outside the Ministry of Civil Service was in charge of the examination, there was a 進士 who insulted him, and those who discussed it thought that the position of the personnel outside the Ministry of Civil Service was too low to be able to convince the public, so the Emperor ordered the servant of the Ministry of Rites". At first, it was only because the official position of the servant of the Ministry of Rites was larger than that of the personnel outside the Ministry of Civil Service, which was a matter of stronger system, not that the official of the ceremony was naturally in charge of the imperial examination and other matters.

In fact, the Ministry of Rites of the Qing Dynasty was the hub for managing the large and small examination halls and academic fame. The provincial education officers' examination of scholars, the examination of tribute students, and the affairs of the prefectural and county schools must be reported to the Ministry of Rites in books to supervise their achievements. For major matters, the chief examiners of the township examination were appointed by the Ministry of Rites upon request to the Emperor. After the examination was completed, the provincial treasurers compiled and submitted the examination papers to the Ministry of Rites. By the spring of the following year, the new and old 举人 from all provinces of the country gathered in the capital to respond to the "metropolitan examination," and the Ministry of Rites was even busier. The examiners (that is, the chief compilers), the co-examiners (that is, the co-editors), the "knowledge tribute officials (that is, the ministers in charge of the entire examination hall), and the distribution of all matters, large and small, in the examination hall, so the metropolitan examination was also called the "Ministry of Rites Examination" or the "Spring Official Examination." Those who are named on this examination list can respond to the palace examination (that is, the Emperor's personal examination, the so-called "listening to the advice of the scholar"). Therefore, the hard work of the cold window, becoming famous in one fell swoop, reached the peak of academic fame. The above only lists the outline, and the details are very complicated and cannot be listed in detail. The Ministry of Rites is so closely related to the examination, but its name has nothing to do with the "examination." The various departments in the ministry, such as the Department of Ritual System (in charge of court meetings and clothing marriage), the Department of Ancestral Sacrifices (in charge of temple sacrifices, funerals, pensions, issuing almanacs, monks, Taoists, temples), the Department of Guests (in charge of tributes from various countries and tributes from various places, grace and rewards), the Department of Refined Meals (in charge of banquets and the number of cattle and sheep), the Bureau of Minting Seals (in charge of the manufacture of official seals, large and small, for various ministries and provinces), and there is no name for managing the examination halls or examinations.

Because the transfer of the imperial examination to the Ministry of Rites in the Tang Dynasty was a temporary measure. If we examine it carefully, it is not as meaningful as the affiliation to "performance evaluation" at the beginning. Performance evaluation is a division of the Ministry of History. The Ministry of History is responsible for the selection of officials and history, and the evaluation of the hundred officials. The selection of talents was originally for the purpose of employing virtuous and talented people, so the contribution and selection are similar (closer to the ceremony). And now the old examination institute is related to the selection and narrative, the name and reality are consistent, and the system is correct. In terms of regulations, it is much more complete than the previous generation.

Written on a Boat Returning Home Zhang Wei
Repeating the original rhyme of Mr. Zhang Yiqu

The blue sea is vast, connecting the water to the sky,
Looking back at my hometown, it should still be the same.
My heart to return is more urgent than the evening tide,
Returning to comfort my loving mother in her old age.

How dare I drift with the world,
My seven-foot body strives to remain strong.
Even if it is difficult to distinguish the five turbidities in the evil world,
There is still a clear stream in the empty mountain.

When realized, everywhere is a pot of heaven,
The heavens and the people are all natural.
Fortunately, the legacy is left after the disaster,
Warming books and closing doors for a long year.

Lightly equipped, I floated on a boat with my mother,
I couldn't bear to leave the prosperity of the city,
The rise and fall of dynasties have become the past,
Only the river water still flows east today.
