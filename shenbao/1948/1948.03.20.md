I separately visited the various authorities, and the Central Government was extraordinarily concerned about our Manchu compatriots. Specific quotas for National Assembly delegates to participate, but the quotas for legislative and supervisory committee members, and the funding of the Manchu Association, have not yet been determined. A few days ago in Shanghai, I met with Director Yu, who promised to facilitate the matter, and also believed that if these two things are not resolved one day, it will greatly affect the progress of all matters. I believe that the Northeast issue has affected the Manchus the most, and Manchus across the country are paying attention to the future evolution of the Northeast. I deeply hope that the Central Government will relax the standards and provide widespread assistance to the Manchus. I believe that Manchus in various places will be able to break down barriers, work together with one heart and one mind, and assist the government to make contributions. I am carrying a copy of my opinion book this time to Beijing, and I will provide it to the Central Government after a thorough review with Mr. Pu Ru, for reference."

### Civil Aviation Corps Plane Attacked Incident: Our Note to the Soviets States This Action is Unfriendly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Regarding the incident where a Civil Aviation Corps plane belonging to Chennault was pursued and shot at by Soviet Red Star fighter planes over the Bohai Sea, our country has again lodged a serious protest with the Soviets on the evening of the 18th. According to an external spokesperson on the 19th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Soviet Embassy in China on the 18th, reiterating the Chinese government's protest to the Soviet government on March 10th regarding the pursuit and shooting of a Chinese plane on March 8th. The note begins by stating: the transport plane employed by the Chinese Ministry of Communications, which was attacked by Soviet fighter planes, "has the letters XT painted on its tail." This marking is a nationally registered Chinese aircraft marking. In addition, the transport plane also has the blue and yellow Chinese insignia of the "Civil Air Transport Corps" and the letters CAT on both sides of the fuselage, making it easily identifiable as a Chinese aircraft. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "expresses deep surprise at the Soviet Embassy's note of March 13th, which stated that this transport plane was an unidentified aircraft." The note continues: "China enjoys full sovereignty over the northeastern provinces (i.e., the three eastern provinces referred to in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945), including the Lushun naval base. This Sino-Soviet Treaty also clearly declares this. The transport planes employed by the Chinese Ministry of Communications have the right to freely fly in any area of these provinces without any interference." Moreover, "the route of the transport plane on March 8th from Shenyang to Qingdao did not pass through the Lushun naval base area. The airspace where the transport plane began to be pursued and shot at by Soviet planes was 45 miles southwest of Lushun, clearly outside the Lushun naval base. The time during which the transport plane was pursued reached 12 minutes, and it was pursued to the airspace near the tip of the Shandong Peninsula." Therefore, the Soviet Embassy's note, which "stated that an unidentified aircraft had violated the border of the Lushun naval base area, not only contradicts the facts but also disregards Chinese sovereignty, and the Soviet plane's pursuit of the Chinese transport plane, reaching the airspace near the tip of the Shandong Peninsula, is clearly an infringement of Chinese airspace rights." The note further states: "Given the current military situation in the northeastern provinces, the above-mentioned obstructive behavior by the Soviet military authorities must be regarded as an unfriendly act." Finally, the note solemnly declares: "Chinese planes have the right to fly without any obstruction in all areas where China has sovereignty, and the Soviet government is requested to strictly prohibit the Soviet military authorities in Lushun from engaging in any similar obstructive behavior as described above."

### Commodity Prices Rose Sixteen-Fold Last Year

Mr. Gu Yuquan's Speech in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Gu Yuquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, gave a speech at the Friday luncheon on the 19th, entitled "China's Economic Problems." Mr. Gu believes that there are two major ailments in the current Chinese economy: one is the shrinkage of production, and the other is the soaring of commodity prices. The shrinkage of production has been greatly affected by the past lack of foreign exchange controls, because the large-scale import of foreign goods has greatly hit the production of domestic goods. However, since the implementation of foreign exchange controls, improvements have been seen. Regarding the commodity price issue, Mr. Gu believes that it is very bad. Commodity prices rose sixteen-fold last year, and the price increases can be divided into four periods. The first period was from December 1946 to February 1947, when the commodity price index rose by 68%, with gold and US dollars rising the most. The second period was from late April to mid-June, when the commodity price index rose by 100%, with grain and cloth rising the most. The third period was in mid-September, when the commodity price index rose by 74%, with rice and gold rising the most. The fourth period was from mid-November to the end of the year, when rice rose the most sharply. In total, prices rose sixteen-fold this year, with US dollars rising the most, twenty-three-fold, followed by gold, rising twenty-fold, rice seventeen-fold, cotton yarn fifteen-fold, and coal the least, also rising seven-fold.

Editorial

### On Rectifying Political Ethics

Politics is about managing the affairs of the people. If politics are not clean and honest, the affairs of the people cannot be managed well, and the entire country and society will inevitably experience turmoil. Therefore, if we want to end the war and build the country through constitutionalism, we must first eliminate corruption, reform politics, and establish a clean and capable government to rectify political ethics.

According to reports, the Guangxi Provincial Government's primary task for civil affairs in 1948 is to "strictly enforce political ethics." Its work plan includes the following key points: (1) Register the property of public officials. (2) Severely punish corruption and illegal acts. (3) Strengthen the power of special commissioners to supervise officials, taking examples from the historical period of turmoil when the power of governors was strengthened. (4) Improve the informer system and heavily reward people and subordinates who report corruption. (5) Reduce redundant staff and improve the living standards of public officials. (6) Establish a special incentive system to heavily reward diligent and creative personnel. (7) Strictly practice frugality and improve the social atmosphere.

This "strictly enforce political ethics" plan has been unanimously supported by all parties, and specific opinions have been put forward. For example, Jiang Jiyi, Speaker of the Guangxi Provincial Assembly, advocated "thoroughly implementing the county magistrate reward and punishment measures, without any favoritism." Provincial Assemblyman Liao Baifang also proposed a motion to "require county magistrates to find guarantors," which was also enthusiastically passed. Zhang Weixia, Director of the Guangxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, advocated "focusing on production and seeking a way out from developing the natural world. The short-term solutions are (1) carefully using the wise and capable, and (2) psychological reform." Other proposals, such as Central Committee Member Li Renren's advocacy of "high salaries to foster integrity" and Guilin Mayor Su Xinmin's advocacy of "it must be from top to bottom," show that Guangxi Province is about to vigorously carry out the rectification of political ethics, which can be said to be a welcome message in a quiet valley.

Indeed, the rectification of political ethics "should be from top to bottom," "high salaries should foster integrity," the wise and capable should be appointed, county magistrates should be rewarded and punished according to law, redundant staff should be thoroughly reduced, clean and capable officials should be heavily rewarded, and corruption and illegal actors should be severely punished. In particular, the supervisory system should be improved. Not only should flies be swatted, but also tigers should be beaten, so that all the flies and tigers in the country can be wiped out in one fell swoop, in order to eliminate the seeds of corruption and cultivate clean and capable political ethics. However, "governing does not lie in many words, but in focusing on practical action," is also an ancient saying. We sincerely hope to see the day when political ethics are truly rectified.

The two maxims of "frugality nourishes integrity" and "diligence compensates for clumsiness" are the driving forces for cultivating clean and capable political ethics. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there have never been officials who were extravagant and indulgent and able to be honest and upright, nor have there ever been officials who were lazy and able to be diligent and love the people. Therefore, if we want to build a clean and capable government, we must first cultivate the political ethics of frugality and diligence among all officials. Frugality and diligence are related. A frugal person is often a diligent person. In this country and society, which has been severely damaged by ten years of war and internal turmoil, the cultivation of a frugal and diligent atmosphere is indeed what the objective environment most needs. However, maintaining a frugal and diligent atmosphere must have the condition of eliminating the threat of hunger and cold. In terms of the current living standards of public officials, 70% to 80% of them cannot afford to eat their fill, especially public officials below the county level, who are suffering from hunger and cold and cannot maintain their lives. If the authorities do not find ways to improve their treatment, not only will administrative efficiency be low, but corruption will also form a tacit habit. Therefore, if we truly want to clarify history, rectify political ethics, and ensure that all levels of government across the country, from central officials to the most grassroots public officials, pay wages in strict accordance with the cost of living index, expand the rationing system, and build housing for public officials, so that the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation of public officials across the country are reasonably resolved, and there is no fear of cold and starvation. Only in this way can we use severe laws to punish their corrupt crimes after they no longer worry about not having enough to eat or wear.

In this era of the beginning of constitutionalism, in the first lesson of civil rights, from the central government to the local level, from the representative bodies to the government, all are engaged in a booming election. No matter what is being elected, candidates should have the spirit of an athlete. In other words, candidates should compete fairly and should have a spirit of law-abiding, a tolerant attitude, a magnanimous temperament, and a habit of cooperation. An enlightened politician, when running for office, must have the spirit of an athlete in a ball game, "only then can he become a qualified democratic politician." Only in this way can we cultivate excellent democratic policies and embark on the bright road of democratic governance. At the same time, voters across the country must carefully handle their own sacred votes: cast this vote for those who can truly seek welfare for the people and serve the country and society faithfully, and never cast it for those who fight for power and profit and engage in malfeasance; cast this vote for those who are loyal to the country, trustworthy, and enjoy popular support, and never cast it for local despots who commit crimes, betray trust, and are widely resented; cast this vote for scholars, experts, or entrepreneurs who have specialized knowledge and skills, and never cast it for bureaucrats, politicians, local bullies, and landlords who are ignorant and incompetent. On the other hand, the heads of various agencies and local officials must select the wise and capable to assist in governance in order to be motivated and vigorous. Therefore, the selection of the wise and capable from the bottom up and the selection of the wise and capable from the top down are the democratic reforms that should be made in building the country through constitutionalism.

In addition, all levels of government and any official should have the two kinds of political ethics of "public" and "loyalty." How can we be public? The government can be fair and selfless if it makes the economy, administration, personnel, etc. public. Generally speaking, the governments of democratic countries have an obligation to publish financial budgets and final accounts to the people. Not only should financial figures be published, but other figures should also be published as much as possible. Not only should figures be published, but all economic measures should also be made easy for the people to understand and should not have any elements of concealment or deception. Before any administrative measures are decided, they should be announced publicly, and even publicized extensively, so that the people can understand the real situation. The promotion and demotion of government officials should be fair and selfless, the wise and capable should be selected, performance evaluations should be conducted regularly, and promotions and demotions should be made public. Only in this way can we build a clean and capable government and implement democratic constitutionalism. How can we be loyal? The meaning of the word "loyalty" is "responsibility." How can the government and officials be responsible? First, they must be responsible to the country, that is, loyal to the country. As this country embarks on the great era of building the country through constitutionalism, officials across the country and at all levels of government must be sincerely for the country, so that the country can become rich and strong. Because officials are the staff of the government, and the government is the agency that represents the country in exercising its powers. All national policies for building the country through constitutionalism are directly implemented by the central government or ordered to be implemented by local governments. Therefore, all laws and regulations of the country, especially the fundamental law of the country, from the central government to the province, special office, county, district, township, town, bao, and jia, all civil servants should faithfully implement and be responsible for doing them in order to realize the rule of the constitution and complete the scale of a democratic country. Second, they must be responsible to the people, that is, loyal to the people. Officials are the servants of the people, and the government is the agency that seeks the welfare of the people, so of course, it must faithfully serve the people. In this tumultuous country and society, the people bear a heavy burden and suffer deeply. Therefore, the government and officials should visit the people at any time to ask about their difficulties and try their best to solve them. They should also work hard to realize any legitimate demands of the people in order to increase the welfare of the people. Third, they must be responsible for their work, that is, loyal to their duties. The government and officials all have their work or duties to do. In this great era of building the country through constitutionalism, the work or duties of governments at all levels and officials across the country are more arduous than usual, so they must naturally take responsibility, stick to their posts, and work hard with renewed energy. They should also be faithful to their duties, and concentrate their energy to do the work of the day while they are in office. They should also consider the nature of the work, distinguish the priority and urgency, plan the process, and carry it out in an orderly manner. If the government and officials can be loyal to the country, then the constitution will be implemented. If they are loyal to the people, then the people's difficulties will be relieved. If they are loyal to their duties, then the country will be governed. "Public" and "loyal" are the two basic political ethics that should be cultivated and the basic spirit that must be promoted in rectifying political ethics.

Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty trusted Zhang Juzheng, and the sluggish political ethics of the time changed. Emperor Cheng of the Qing Dynasty relied on Zeng Guofan to reverse the fate of the greedy and corrupt Manchu dynasty. We currently have nothing of lofty ideals to talk about. Where is Zhang Juzheng? When will we have a Zeng Guofan? In this great era of suppressing rebellion and building the country through constitutionalism, we already have a national leader who led us to victory in the war. We only hope that the adults and gentlemen who assist the leader will learn from the examples of the sages, be loyal to the country, bring out a brand-new spirit, lead the majority of pure and good civil servants, and create a refreshing political atmosphere. Reversing chaos and restoring order is the only key!

### Textile Federation Cables Ministry of Economic Affairs Again

Requesting to Participate in Compensation Goods Evaluation Committee

[Report from this City] The National Textile Industry Federation held a board meeting on the 18th. Regarding the organization of the Japanese Compensation Goods Evaluation Committee, the Federation had previously requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to send representatives to participate, but this request was not approved. A resolution was passed to cable again, strongly advocating for participation. The original cable stated, in essence: "Regarding the previous request by this Federation to nominate two representatives to participate in the Japanese Compensation Goods Evaluation Committee, the response was that the selection of committee members had been separately delegated to the ROC General Chamber of Commerce and the China Industry Association. This Federation has learned that the Ministry intends to prioritize the development of the textile industry in the allocation of these machine tools. The request by this Federation to nominate representatives to participate in the evaluation is solely aimed at contributing from the perspective of the industry, hoping to benefit the development of the industry. However, this request has been rejected by the Ministry. At the third board meeting of this Federation on the 18th of this month, unanimous dissatisfaction was expressed... Regarding the request to send representatives to participate, the Ministry has accommodated the Chambers of Commerce and the Industry Association, yet excludes the textile industry, which holds the most significant volume in both industry and commerce. This neglect of the national textile industry organization contradicts the Ministry's intentions. Could reconsideration be given?"

### Academic Qualifications of Naval Graduates Have Been Redefined

Eliminating the Traditional Factional Divisions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] For decades, factional divisions within the Chinese Navy have greatly affected the development of the navy. After the establishment of the Naval Headquarters, the Shanghai Naval Officer School and the Qingdao Naval Training Corps were first merged. Currently, officer training is concentrated at the Qingdao Naval Officer School, non-commissioned officer training is concentrated at the Taiwan Naval Non-Commissioned Officer School, and shipbuilding, armament manufacturing, and electrical engineering training are concentrated at the Shanghai Mechanical School. Since last year, each school has adopted a provincial quota system for enrollment. The Headquarters recently summoned representatives of graduates from the former Qingdao, Dianlei, Huangpu, and Mawei naval schools to Nanjing to discuss the standardization of their academic qualifications and seniority. More than ten people attended, including Tian Yuehui, many of whom are now key members of the navy. Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui personally presided over the meeting.

The case is now being tried by the military court in the local government.

### New Treatments Discovered for Cancer and Pulmonary Tuberculosis

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] News from the China Society of Natural Sciences: (1) Cancer is a poisonous stone that occurs in animal tissues or organs, often leading to death. Scientists have been seeking the causes and methods of treatment in recent years. Recently, the journal "Science" reported that Dr. Heathmi and others at the American Marine Research Institute, while searching for bacteria that decompose petroleum carbohydrates, obtained a bacterium that decomposes petroleum carbohydrates and gains energy for its survival. Petroleum carbohydrates are often used to induce cancer in animals. Therefore, these marine scientists specifically suggest using this trace substance from seawater for cancer treatment trials. (2) The compound ERG, which produces vitamin D, is now being used by Dr. Reb to treat patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The majority show significant improvement after six months. Examinations of patients with severe tuberculosis show that the number of tuberculosis bacteria is greatly reduced or eliminated. This drug is not a direct germicidal agent, nor does it function by transforming into vitamin D. Instead, it helps patients strengthen their resistance to bacteria, allowing them to recover sooner.

### National Standard Time Zones Redefined

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The regulations for the implementation of national standard time were amended and promulgated in the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], dividing the country into five standard time zones. Now that the nine northeastern provinces have been reorganized and Taiwan has been restored, the originally defined standard time zones should be changed accordingly. The Ministry of Interior has submitted the revised regulations to the Executive Yuan for approval and has ordered all provincial and municipal governments to implement them uniformly. The regulations are as follows: (1) National time is divided into five zones: Zone A, using the time at 127.5 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Changbai Zone. Zone B, using the time at 120 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Central Plains Zone. Zone C, using the time at 105 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Longshu Zone. Zone D, using the time at 90 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Xinzang Zone. Zone E, using the time at 82.5 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Kunlun Zone. (2) The supply of standard time for all parts of the country shall be jointly the responsibility of the Astronomical Research Institute of the Academia Sinica and the Survey Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The Ministry of Interior shall entrust the Central Broadcasting Administration to handle timekeeping matters. The liaison methods shall be negotiated by the relevant agencies themselves and submitted to the Ministry of Interior for record. The time announcements of all private broadcasting stations shall be based on the time broadcast by the Central Broadcasting Station. (3) The time of all telecommunications agencies throughout the country must be synchronized with the standard time of each zone and be responsible for answering people's inquiries about the time (The methods for calibrating the time of the aforementioned telecommunications agencies shall be formulated by the Ministry of Interior in consultation with the Ministry of Transportation). (4) Each local government should set up a radio to receive the standard time of the zone. A specially prepared clock must be calibrated. Local governments without a radio should negotiate with the local telecommunications agency to calibrate their clocks according to the telecommunications agency's time at a fixed time each day. (5) Each local government should set up a standard clock or specially prepared clock and use a noon gun or other signal to transmit the time to the local people to ensure compliance. The management of the standard clock and time reporting should be assigned to specific personnel who are responsible. (6) Clocks in all agencies should be corrected at least once a day, and the correction should be the responsibility of personnel designated by each agency.

### The Overseas Chinese Community in Burma (Part 1)

— By Our Correspondent, Yuan Wenzhong

[Report from our Rangoon office, transmitted via airmail on the 14th] The number of overseas Chinese in Burma is estimated to be around 300,000. Those originating from Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangdong provinces are the most numerous. The most important businesses they operate are timber, rice, hotels, pawnshops, local products, and general merchandise. They, alongside Indians, control the middle and lower economic forces in Burma.

Overseas Chinese Organizations

When the journalist group arrived in Rangoon on the first day, upon disembarking at the airport, aside from people sent by the embassy and consulate to provide care, no trace of overseas Chinese could be seen. Later, within the ten days in Rangoon, apart from being invited to two receptions and tea parties held by overseas Chinese organizations to welcome Ambassador Tu Yuntan, contact with overseas Chinese was mostly limited to personal interactions. However, in Rangoon, a city with 50,000 overseas Chinese, there are a great number of overseas Chinese organizations. According to the statistics in the Directory of Rangoon Overseas Chinese Organizations and Businesses compiled and presented by the Burma Overseas Chinese Service Association, there are seventy or eighty industrial and commercial organizations, cultural organizations, hometown associations, and other institutions and organizations. However, in their activities, they each act independently. Although there is no significant friction between them, there is no united force.

Party and Government Activities

What we first felt in Rangoon was that the activities of the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League of China within the overseas Chinese community were quite active. There are four Chinese-language daily newspapers in Rangoon, and their content is very poor. Many of the news items published are old news from several days ago, and the supplements and other news are mostly copied from domestic newspapers. The largest is the "China Daily", which claims to be the tail of the "Ta Kung Pao" and has the best circulation, approximately over one thousand copies per day. The next is the "New Rangoon Daily", whose chairman is a wavering Kuomintang member. Its newspaper has become a propaganda tool for the Democratic League, spreading speeches and news that undermine the government's credibility every day, with a circulation of several hundred copies. Next is the "National Daily" organized by the Kuomintang General Branch, but its content is not very satisfactory, and its circulation ranks only third. Finally, the Communist Party's "People's Daily", although with a circulation of only a few dozen copies, manufactures rumors every day, attacking the central government and shaking the faith of overseas Chinese in the government. In terms of bookstores, there are three in Rangoon: the Zhengwen Bookstore, the Hua Bookstore, and the Nanchiao Cultural Supply Society. Their scale is very small, and the types of books sold are very few. Among them, the Nanchiao Cultural Supply Society is a stronghold for the activities of the Communist Party and the Democratic League. In addition to newspapers and bookstores, the Democratic League and the Communist Party have recently infiltrated overseas Chinese schools. Recently, the Communist International held a Southeast Asian Youth Conference in India. So-called Chinese representatives from Hong Kong attended, and when they passed through Rangoon, the newspapers greatly exaggerated their visit, and many organizations held meetings to welcome them. Although the embassy and consulate received reports about these activities, due to the different overseas environment, the Burmese government is pro-left, and most overseas Chinese lack understanding of politics. Therefore, they have not yet come up with effective countermeasures.

Overview of Education

Speaking of overseas Chinese schools in Burma, there are quite a few. There are twenty or thirty primary and secondary schools in Rangoon, and as many as one hundred and seventy primary schools in other places. Among them, several schools have spacious school buildings, teach in Mandarin, and the level is quite up to standard. However, most schools teach in local dialects, and they have various common difficulties and shortcomings: First, funds are exhausted, because the government provides almost no assistance to overseas Chinese education. The funds for schools at all levels rely entirely on local overseas Chinese for maintenance, and the general economic capacity of overseas Chinese has generally declined after the war, so the funds for each school have been greatly affected. Second, teaching materials are lacking. Very few national textbooks can be found, and even if some are sent from the country, they are not enough to distribute. Third, there is a shortage of teachers. Good teachers are not easy to hire. In several larger schools, each teacher has to undertake nearly two or more class hours, and teachers in most other schools inevitably fill the ranks without real ability. It is very common for middle school graduates to become middle school teachers, and primary school graduates to become primary school teachers.

Policy Issues

Since Burma's independence, the idea of national economic-ism has been very strong. Under this policy, overseas Chinese have been affected in three main ways: first, larger enterprises will be nationalized by the government; second, imports and exports are entirely controlled by the government, making it difficult for overseas Chinese commercial activities; and third, the promulgation of the Real Estate Act stipulates that foreign nationals with more than 50 mu of land can only sell the excess to Burmese people. However, these influences are not as serious as we imagined. Most overseas Chinese do not seem to have much worry about their property. For example, regarding the nationalization of enterprises, they believe that as long as the government pays the purchase price, it does not matter; and for example, regarding land property restrictions, they believe that as long as they can sell it and get money, is it not the same?

In fact, this policy of the Burmese government is not uniquely discriminatory against overseas Chinese. These measures are only intended to protect the status of Burmese people themselves. Therefore, regarding the issue of the repatriation of overseas Chinese, the Burmese government has been delaying on the pretext that housing and work are difficult to find. So far, approximately six thousand overseas Chinese have returned to Burma for repatriation, while seven thousand are still stranded in Fujian and Guangdong. Recently, after repeated negotiations by our authorities, the Burmese government sent people to China for inspection and has agreed to allow two thousand people to come to Burma this year, of which one thousand can handle the procedures immediately, and another one thousand are still under review.

### Communist Bandit Drug Manufacturing Organization Cracked in Beiping; Three Drug Dens Established in the East, West, and North of the City; Elaborate Secret Rooms Built; Large Quantities of Drugs Seized

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] The Beiping Garrison Headquarters' Investigation Department recently took swift action to crack down on a large-scale drug manufacturing organization of the Communist bandits, seizing many drugs and drug-making machines, and capturing ten people involved, including He Xicai. After the Investigation Department had completed a stage of the case's investigation, it invited Chinese and foreign reporters in the area to visit three bandit drug manufacturing organizations set up in the east, west, and north of the city on the 18th.

The Eastern City drug den was located at 8 South Song Bridge, Liusi Alley, Dongsi, which is He Xicai's residence. He is 51 years old, a native of Ningjin, Hebei. His son, Hongji (also known as Mingliang, 28 years old), and his father had no legitimate occupation and engaged in selling drugs and running private silver shops during the enemy puppet period. After the victory, they intensified their activities, colluding with Communist bandits, contacting Lü Yuzhen, purchasing clerk Zhang Ruilin, and their accomplices Li Tongde, Han Furui, Wang Xuexin, An Zicheng, Guo Hongsheng, and others to manufacture large quantities of potent drugs. Lü Yuzhen and others continuously transported large quantities of opium from the Communist bandit Jin-Ji-Cha border area and handed them over to He Xicai and his son, who gathered their gang to build hidden walls and compartments in their residence, opened a factory to manufacture drugs, and hid them in tables and chairs with flexible and sophisticated mechanisms. They also purchased huge amounts of Barbital, caffeine, acetic acid, and other drug-making raw materials, with Ge Yongtai, Bian Mingjiu, and Meng Huankai responsible for manufacturing and purchasing, respectively, and Zhang Dingren, Xu Yunshan, Wang Zengfu, Chen Guoliang, Du Chunhe, and others responsible for sales. In total, for more than two years since the victory, the amount of white heroin and other drugs they manufactured was too large to calculate. The areas where they sold them were mostly Xi'an, Taiyuan, Shanghai, and other places. Each round trip by air could earn them hundreds of millions of yuan, and countless people were poisoned by them, leading to bankruptcy and family separation. In the west room of He's residence, there was a wall with a hidden, easily operated opening mechanism. When the wall was opened, three secret rooms appeared. The rooms contained three-drawer desks and exquisite sofas, all with hollow layers. The rear wall of the secret room was also movable and could be opened, revealing a culvert leading to the cellar, which contained many hidden instruments and drugs.

Bian Mingjiu's house at 20 Fangsheng Alley in the Western City drug den contained drug-making machines, drugs, and transparent paper printed with the "Pine, Bamboo, and Plum" trademark, as well as various too many stamps. When reporters went to inspect, a large number of drug-making drugs and instruments and opium pipes were found on the roof due to filming by the No. 3 China Electric Factory, which was a new gain in this case.

The Northern City drug den was located at Zhang Shouren's house at 22 Xiang'er Alley. A full barrel of chloroform (a potent anesthetic) stored in a large gasoline barrel, as well as six original boxes of Mari Road (approximately more than thirty small boxes, each box worth over six million yuan), two large bottles of acetic acid, and over thirty pounds of caffeine, all drug-making raw materials, were seized.

The above He Xicai, He Hongji, Zhang Shouren, Wang Zengfu, Chen Zuoxiang, Ao Mingjiu, Meng Xingkai, Ge Yongtai, Du Chunhe, Xu Shuman, and other ten people have been arrested, but the Communist bandits Lü Yuzhen and Zhang Ruilin had already used the huge amount of money they obtained from selling drugs to purchase military supplies and taken them to the bandit area in exchange for opium, so they were not caught. The method they used to transport opium was that Li Tongde, who was not arrested, went to the bandit area to purchase it, detoured through Tianjin, hid the opium in bags of sodium sulfide, and transported it to Beiping. From this, the huge organization of the Communist bandit drug manufacturing organization can be seen.

Regarding the insidious nature of their conspiracy, Chief Ni Chaokai of the Investigation Department told reporters: "The bandits conspire to obtain military supplies from us and spare no effort to achieve their goals by all despicable means. The bandit drug manufacturing organization that was cracked this time is one example. The bandits transport the drugs they manufacture to Shanghai, Xi'an, and Taiyuan in exchange for gold, which is then converted into legal currency to purchase telephone machines, automobile parts, and other military supplies, in effect sucking our blood. We hope that the cracking of this case can raise the awareness of local security authorities and pay closer attention to bandits at all times." He also said: "According to investigations over the years, many drug trafficking cases have been discovered, and they may all be related to this case."

### Marshall Emphasizes Seriousness of European and Asian Situation, Resolves to Wage Struggle Against Tyranny, Remains Open to Coordination with Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper] New York 19th Dispatch: California Dispatch, Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech today to students at the University of California, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Warn Italy and other free countries in Europe that if they are controlled by the Communist Party, U.S. aid will automatically cease; (2) The current struggle in the world is a struggle between freedom and tyranny. Domination imposed by force must not be allowed to expand again; (3) The United States maintains the "Open Door" policy and is still willing to resolve various issues with the Soviet Union through coordination; (4) Implement the European Recovery Program as soon as possible to strengthen the self-defense capabilities of Western European countries.

[Reuters, Berkeley, California, 19th] Secretary of State Marshall, on the 19th, received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of California here. In his impromptu speech, he spoke of the European situation, saying, "Never in history has there been a situation more threatening to our doctrines and interests than the current one." He also said that there are also critical situations in the Middle East, Indonesia, China, Central America, and Latin America. He believes that the United States urgently needs to establish a firm resolution in the universal struggle for freedom and against autocracy in the world. Marshall also warned Italy, declaring that if the Communist Party wins in the general election in Italy, the economic aid that Italy receives from the United States will be cut off. However, Marshall also expressed his willingness to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, in which case the current dangerous situation could be ended immediately and forever. Marshall emphasized that the United States will never passively avoid current problems with inaction, nor can it disperse its efforts, rendering its strength ineffective. The central issue is where and how the United States should use its power. He pointed out that the dangerous situation exists not only in Europe, but also in China and the Middle East. The United States must also not ignore Latin America and its direct responsibilities in Japan and Korea. Marshall outlined the position of the United States as follows: "Our aim and policy is to adhere to basic principles while maintaining an open door to any general compromise action. We sincerely and earnestly seek a perfect basis for reaching an agreement to end the current situation forever. We will continue to do our best to reach an agreement, but until a genuine solution can be reached, our policy will be to oppose and prevent any further attempts to infringe on the rights and lives of free people. The immediate and effective way to stop this continuing crisis is to quickly and immediately implement the European Recovery Program. The United States has never faced such a serious situation before, and the European Recovery Program is the basis for all our future decisions."

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall departed from Washington today to deliver speeches across the country to raise public awareness of the need for a conscription system and universal military training. He will speak at the University of California at Berkeley on the morning of the 19th, and at the University of California in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon. He departed on the President's special plane "Sacred Cow" and is scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday.

### How Will the Kremlin React? The World is Watching Closely

[Reuters, London, 18th] Diplomatic circles here expect a short pause before Western countries or the United States take new steps to curb the expansion of Communist forces, to consolidate the actions launched in Washington and Brussels yesterday, and to observe Moscow's reaction. Observers disagree on whether Moscow will adjust the current plan of the Communist Information Bureau because of the unity of the West and Truman's guarantee to support this unity. However, continuing to support the Italian Communist Party in its efforts to win the victory in the April 18th general election will undoubtedly continue to be one of Moscow's basic policies.

The next step that Western countries will take will largely depend on Moscow's steps. If Moscow does not launch a new diplomatic offensive, there should not be any surprising developments outside the Soviet-controlled areas for a while. The immediate task of Western countries in the future should be to consolidate the plans they have already announced. Therefore, before the Western European Union has gained a solid foothold, this new international system is not expected to expand immediately. However, if the Soviet government launches a counterattack immediately, it will be a different matter. Therefore, what diplomatic circles are most concerned about at present is any reaction that will be generated from the Kremlin.

### Western European Five-Nation Alliance Will Be Realized Quickly

Montgomery to Inspect Defense in Belgium

[Reuters, Brussels, 18th] Only 24 hours after the signing of the Five-Nation Alliance Treaty, the Belgian government has submitted a bill to Congress requesting ratification of the treaty. It is expected that the other four countries, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, will also take swift steps to ratify the alliance treaty. At the same time, the five foreign ministers have decided to convene the Permanent Consultative Committee stipulated in the treaty in Beijing next week to discuss its powers and duties. This is a step to quickly implement the Five-Nation Treaty. The most urgent task is defense and economic initiatives. When British Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery visits Belgium soon at the invitation of the Belgian government to inspect Belgian military facilities, he will be able to discuss joint defense matters in connection with the five-nation relations.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 18th] Canadian officials said that Canada would be willing to participate when the Brussels Five-Nation Treaty is expanded to accommodate other countries. The official also said that the regional covenant mentioned in the United Nations Charter has flexibility in the word "regional" and is not limited to Western Europe. If it can include all democratic countries, Canada will be happy to participate.

### Northern European Three Nations Unite Against Communism

[Reuters, Swedish Capital, 18th] The Social Democratic Party held a conference here. Swedish Prime Minister Erlander, Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft, and Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen all attended the meeting and delivered speeches. Erlander said that opposing communism in a democratic way is part of Sweden's plan to safeguard freedom and independence. The stability and strength of Scandinavia are factors for peace. The unity of the Scandinavian countries is not aimed at anyone, and others need not feel threatened. Erlander also said that the Czech incident has exposed the mask of the Communist Party. Sweden will participate in the work of defending freedom and peace, but is unwilling to give up hope of promoting a global national agreement in advance. Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen claimed that although the strength of the Communist Party in Scandinavia is not strong, its threat should not be underestimated. It is expected that the Communist Party in Scandinavia will do its best to disrupt the economy as part of its plan to obstruct the Marshall Plan. Gerhardsen also said that the greatest contribution of the Scandinavian countries to world peace is to assist in the reconstruction of Europe.

[Agence France-Presse, Stockholm, 18th] Although international developments, especially those concerning Finland, have not actually changed Sweden's foreign policy, informed sources believe that the Swedish government will take certain steps to consolidate its national defense. If the special funds required for this move are difficult to raise, the Social Democratic government may be unwilling to bear this heavy responsibility alone and will organize a coalition government excluding the Communist Party.

### German Communist Party Establishes People's Committee

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th] The plenary session of the Second People's Congress closed today and elected a 400-member People's Committee, three-quarters of whom are from the Soviet occupation zone. The Congress also elected a 29-member Council of the People's Committee, 20 of whom are from the Soviet occupation zone.

[Reuters, Hanover, 18th] British Commissioner Loghen of Lower Saxony told reporters today that due to the evolution of the international situation, a general election may be held throughout the western German occupation zone this year.

### French Military Expenditure is Huge

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The National Assembly's Defense Committee recently resolved that French military expenditure for April and May will total 55 billion francs. Communist members voted against the motion during the vote. The bill will soon be submitted to the National Assembly for debate.

### Soviet Union Plans to Abandon Italian Warships to Win Over Italian Hearts

[Reuters, Rome, 18th] The right-wing "Rome Evening News" reported that the Italian Communist Party has learned from Moscow that the Soviet Union will announce, a few days before the Italian general election, that it will give up the Italian warships that should be distributed to the Soviet Union under the Italian peace treaty, in order to increase Italian goodwill towards the Soviet Union and win over the People's Front controlled by the Communist Party. The Italian warships that the Soviet Union should receive include one battleship, one cruiser, two submarines, and other types of ships.

### U.S. Does Not Attach Importance to Red Army Demobilization

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The State Department does not believe that the demobilization of the Soviet Army, as claimed by the Moscow Radio Station, has significant meaning. State Department spokesman McDermott said that the reports received by the U.S. government indicate that although there is a level of demobilization of the Soviet Army, another level is being conscripted at the same time.

### France and Italy Adopt Anti-Communist Measures; French Authorities Deport Soviet Nationals; Italy Uncovers Secret Communist Arms Cache

[United Press, Paris, 19th] The French National Assembly passed a bill on the 19th by a vote of 414 to 183, aimed at taking measures to prevent possible Communist coups or nationwide strikes. The bill empowers the government to appoint eight Inspector Generals and has the power to assist the Minister of Interior in maintaining order during domestic unrest. The bill encountered fierce opposition from the Communist Party.

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The residence of Audinetz, former chairman of the "Union of Soviet Citizens", was searched last night, resulting in the arrest of twelve people, including Audinetz. According to a Ministry of Interior bulletin, the French government discovered that the "Union of Soviet Citizens", which was ordered to be dissolved by the authorities on December 15 of last year, has secretly resumed its activities, and its guidance committee regularly holds meetings in various places. At the most recent gathering, all attendees were arrested. After interrogation and based on the documents seized, it was confirmed that the individuals had acted in defiance of the French government's orders, and it was decided to deport them immediately. At the same time, the police are also investigating nationals from Soviet-Hungarian-Polish-South African countries.

[United Press, Rome, 19th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi began a tour of the northern industrial area, a Communist Party stronghold, today to launch a massive campaign. In his speech, he condemned the Italian left for obeying foreign orders. Gasperi felt strengthened by President Truman's guarantee to aid democratic countries. In his speech in Bologna, he expressed his willingness to fully support the Western European alliance to save freedom, peace, and culture. The Italian Prime Minister accused the Communist Information Bureau of setting up secret committees in northern Italy and France to coordinate the Communist Party's schemes in northern Italy and France. He said, "Not voting is cowardice, voting is a responsibility, and voting the wrong way is treason." Gasperi will deliver anti-communist speeches in Bologna, Milan, and other Communist-controlled areas. As the tense atmosphere of the general election intensifies, the police have been mobilized to search for secretly hidden weapons. In recent searches, 56 Communist Party members have been accused of illegally possessing arms. One location contained 200 rifles, 14 submachine guns, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, and wireless transceiver equipment.

[United Press, Rome, 19th] The Communist Party held a mass rally in the city center today. The second-in-command of the Communist Party, Longo, delivered a speech.

The treaty is valid for twenty years.

### Stassen Advocates Declaring Communist Party Illegal

[Reuters, Cleveland, 18th] Republican presidential candidate Stassen today advocated that the United States immediately declare the Communist Party an illegal organization.

### World Conference on Freedom of the Press Decides to Open Next Tuesday; The Conference Advocates Giving Journalists Greater Freedom to Work

[Reuters, Geneva, 19th] The World Conference on Freedom of the Press is scheduled to open in Geneva on the 23rd of this month to discuss the implementation of a declaration made by the United Nations General Assembly sixteen months ago: "Freedom of the press is a fundamental human right and a touchstone of all freedoms upon which the United Nations Organization is based." In addition to all members of the United Nations, those invited to attend the meeting also include Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, and Transjordan. The International Organization of Journalists will obtain special status at the conference. The organization will submit specific proposals to the conference to give journalists greater freedom to work, improve the professional capabilities of journalists, and prevent the monopolization of the press.

The United Nations Economic and Social Council, which is hosting the conference, has previously requested governments to send delegations composed of professional journalists, broadcasters, and film workers. The conference will consider drafting a world charter on the rights and obligations of the press and recommend methods for fulfilling this charter, such as through international conventions and the establishment of a world press association, which would have the right to investigate complaints about false and defamatory reports and obstructions to the circulation of news.

Conference Declaration Has Already Been Drafted

In addition, the conference will also issue a declaration clarifying the meaning of freedom of the press. The draft declaration has been drafted by a sixteen-member subcommittee and will be submitted to the conference for discussion. The conference will then determine the basic principles for press workers based on the declaration adopted. The proposed principles include: (1) reporting facts from an impartial standpoint and disseminating news in good faith; (2) facilitating the solution of world economic, social, and humanitarian problems through the free exchange of information; (3) assisting in the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons regardless of race, gender, language, or religion, and assisting in the eradication of any doctrines that may endanger such human rights and freedoms.

### Soviet-Supported International Brigades Gather in Northern Greece to Cross the Border; U.S. State Department Receives Intelligence

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The State Department received a report today stating that three Soviet-supported "International Army" divisions, totaling approximately 30,000 soldiers, are stationed in the Balkans, preparing to cross the border into Greece. The majority of this army is composed of Greeks and Albanians. According to State Department officials, although the accelerated anti-Greek movement proves to be under Soviet military command, the presence of Soviet officers in the command headquarters of this "International Army" cannot be proven. It is unclear whether this trend indicates an imminent attack on Greece or is still part of the Communist Party's psychological warfare.

### Clementis Appointed Czech Foreign Minister

Security Council Will Not Take Action on Czech Case

[United Press, Czech Capital, 19th] Prague Radio broadcast today that the Czech government has appointed Clementis as Minister of Foreign Affairs to succeed Masaryk. Clementis is a Slovak lawyer, currently 46 years old.

[United Press, Prague, 18th] The Czech Parliament revoked the privileges of six non-Communist cabinet members on the 18th, making them the first batch of cabinet members to be tried in court since the Czech coup.

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] All indications suggest that the United Nations' discussion of the Czech coup may fade away without any action being taken. According to reliable sources, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are unwilling to pressure the Security Council to make a resolution on Chile's accusation that the Soviet Union instigated the Czech Communist Party coup. It is believed that the Western allies' hesitation will prevent the Security Council from taking any action.

### Four Powers Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty, Still No Agreement

[Reuters, London, 18th] The representatives of the four powers' foreign ministers discussed the Soviet Union's request for German property in Austria. Although the representatives of the four powers made concessions, no agreement was reached. Soviet representative Kokomov stated that the Soviet Union was willing to concede one percent on its request for oil production in eastern Austria, to 66 percent of the total amount, and was also prepared to reduce the amount of cash that Austria was required to pay the Soviet Union by 175,000,000 to $200 million. The Western powers' concessions on the issue of oil production in Eastern Europe would allow the Soviet Union to obtain 50 to 53 percent of the oil production. Regarding oil refineries, the Western powers agreed that the Soviet Union should obtain an oil refinery with an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons, while the Soviet representative insisted that it should be at least 450,000 tons.

### Wallace Criticizes Truman's Policies

[United Press, New York, 19th] Third-party presidential candidate Wallace issued his response today, targeting Truman's call to restore conscription. He said that the strategy to deter communism has been overextended, endangering the lives of human beings throughout the world. He also said that the United States has no reason to go to war with the Soviet Union. He accused "opportunists" of trying to "obscure the truth" by using the word "communism" to restore conscription and incite a third world war. Wallace said, "Scolding like a shrew" will accomplish nothing. "I call for world peace. Basic land reforms in China and Italy are long overdue. The Communist Party recognizes this and exploits it, but they cannot create anything. The U.S. government dismisses movements that cannot be avoided by the tide of history and simply labels them as 'communist aggression.' I cannot bear to witness billions of dollars, and, more importantly, millions of American lives, being squandered because some American politicians are unwilling to accept simple facts." According to Truman, who announced yesterday that he would rather fail than accept Wallace's support "or that of his communists," Wallace remained silent about this today.

### Kashmir Dispute: Negotiations Stall Again

### Japan Needs Foreign Capital, Which Will Eliminate Labor Unrest

Ashida Speaks to Reporters

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] Hitoshi Ashida recently gave his first interview to the Japanese press since taking office as Prime Minister, stating that the Japanese government will work hard to complete preparations to encourage foreign capital investment in Japan.

In addition, a comprehensive clause is attached, stating that military aid can be provided to any country threatened by aggression.

### Minister of Finance Yu and Others Arrive in Shanghai to Promote the Raising of Special Relief Donations, Adopting a Six-Fold Estimated Tax Payment for Enterprise Income Tax, and Inviting Business Leaders in Shanghai to Explain the Reasons

[Our Newspaper] Minister of Finance Yu, along with Director Sang of the Ministry's General Affairs Department, arrived in Shanghai by train at 2:15 PM yesterday from Nanjing. According to reports, the main purpose of this trip is to inspect the collection of special relief donations and general tax revenue in the Shanghai area. He is scheduled to attend the second meeting of the Shanghai Area Special Relief Donation Committee, which will be held at the City Hall at 3:00 PM today, where he will explain the central government's specific measures for raising special relief donations and hopes for assistance from all sectors.

### New Income Tax Law to be Promulgated and Implemented Immediately, Director of the Direct Taxation Department Talks, Encouraging the Campaign to Eliminate False Accounts

Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Direct Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, came to Shanghai on official business. He told reporters on the 19th: The new Income Tax Law has been revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan and will be promulgated and implemented soon. The new tax law is based on ten years of collection experience and drafted by adopting the opinions of taxpayers as much as possible, so it is a major improvement compared to the old tax law. The characteristics of the new tax law are simple procedures, reduced tax rates, and widespread application. The purpose is to reduce the burden on taxpayers, and at the same time increase the country's tax revenue. Because taxpayers obtain fair and reasonable burdens, tax evasion is no longer necessary, and the losses suffered by the country's tax revenue can be avoided. He continued to analyze the contents of the new tax law, saying that the objects of classified income tax include the following five categories: (1) Business income, (2) Salary and remuneration, (3) Interest income, (4) Property leasing, (5) Temporary income. Except for items (2) to (5), which will be paid by the proposed payer, and merchant income is withheld by the shipping company, the business income tax has been decided to be cancelled. The method of calculation based on the amount of capital, which caused the factor of "false profit and wide tax," has been removed. As for the tax rate, although it is still progressive to 30%, the burden on taxpayers is much lighter than in the past, as the excessive profit tax has been cancelled. Wang said that after the implementation of the new tax law, tax evasion will tend to decrease, which will help improve national morality. However, he said that it is difficult to guarantee that cunning people will continue their illegal behavior, so the punishment for tax evasion will be more severe than in the past. He believes that the business community should urgently launch a "campaign to eliminate false accounts" at this time, and hopes that public opinion will provide strong support. Making false accounts not only deceives the government and damages tax revenue, but also deceives shareholders and reduces their interest in investing in legitimate businesses, which is a major obstacle to the development of industry and commerce.

This meeting discussed the rice rationing liaison methods between cities and strengthening the work of distribution and supervision. According to Chen, the results of the first rice rationing were satisfactory, although there were still some shortcomings, the reason was that the preparation time was too short. He firmly believes that the rice rationing work next month will be on the right track.

They said that it was not easy to fully launch the first distribution work in just ten days.

### More Than 100 Families in Shantytowns on Xuchang Road Appeal to the Senate to Postpone Demolition

More than 100 families in the shantytowns on Xuchang Road and Jilin Road in this city are all refugees from the bandit areas of northern Jiangsu.

The representatives also pointed out in the original petition that the land had been barren for more than 20 years before the shacks were built and had not been used. The expenses for building the shacks by the refugees were all borrowed, raised through debt, organized associations, and mortgages. Once forcibly demolished, they will inevitably be destitute.

### Rice Rationing for Municipal Government Employees Decided to be Five Dou as the Principle

The municipal government, in order to improve the treatment of employees, has submitted a request to the central government to restore the original ration of food rice for public and educational personnel in this area (i.e., eight dou for staff members, eight dou for technicians, and four dou for laborers). It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has approved the following instructions: "Because it concerns the treatment of public and educational personnel nationwide, it is difficult to approve." It is reported that the municipal government now intends to have the Civil Food Allocation Committee allocate affordable rice to all employees to make up for the shortfall, and the allocation amount will be based on the principle that employees receive five dou of rice per month. For example, if the rice ration for staff members and public education personnel is reduced from eight dou to three dou, then two dou will be allocated at an affordable price. The technicians' rice ration has been reduced from eight dou to two dou, and three dou will now be allocated. The laborers' original ration was four dou, which has been reduced to two dou, and two dou will now be allocated.

### Unemployed Workers Cause Trouble, Destroy Shelter, Director and Wife Beaten and Injured

[Our Newspaper] At about 11:00 AM yesterday, Cao Yanwen, director of the Third Shelter, No. 2 Jungong Road, East Shanghai, and his wife Wang Mojun were suddenly severely beaten by many male and female workers from the unemployed workers' hostel in the vicinity, and the shelter's office was destroyed.

### The Municipal Government Decides to Reject the Unemployed's Administrative Appeal, Sun Hongyuan is to Blame for the Loose Organization of the Association

After the incident in which the employees and dancers of the Dance Hall Industry Association of this city destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, the authorities dissolved the association. Sun Hongyuan, the chairman of the association, then filed an administrative appeal with the municipal government in accordance with the Administrative Appeal Law. The municipal government has now decided to reject it for the following reasons: "The association held a symposium on January 24, presided over by Sun Hongyuan, attended by 34 representatives of musicians, dancers, and employees, and decided to hold a general meeting at Xin Xianlin Dance Hall at 9:00 AM on January 31. A joint meeting was held on January 29, attended by 275 people, presided over by Sun Hongyuan, and it was decided that all would go to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and special trucks were prepared for the dancers, and those who did not attend would be punished, employees would be suspended, and dancers would be fined 2 million to 3 million yuan. On the morning of January 31, the general meeting was held, and all employees, dancers, etc. unanimously demanded to go to the Social Affairs Bureau. This is obviously planned by the appellant Sun Hongyuan. It is further investigated that on May 18 of last year, the National Government promulgated the Measures for Maintaining Social Order, which stipulated in Article 2 that the number of petition representatives should be limited to ten. At that time, they did not elect representatives to speak to the handling government, but swarmed into various offices and arbitrarily destroyed them. Even if the appellant Sun Hongyuan's purpose was not to carry out riots, encouraging tens of thousands of people to collectively petition was to cause any unfortunate events. The appellant Sun Hongyuan failed to prevent it in advance, and failed to dissuade it afterwards, which shows that the association's organization was loose at ordinary times, and the appellant Sun Hongyuan is to blame."

### Urban Planning to be Implemented in the Western District of Zhabei, Land to be Expropriated First and then Re-Plotted, Zhao Zukang Talks About Resolutions of the Public Works Conference

[Our Newspaper] Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, recently went to Nanjing to attend the Public Works Conference convened by the Ministry of Interior to discuss the urban planning of the model area in the western district of Zhabei in this city, and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing the meeting. Reporters paid a special visit yesterday to inquire about the progress of the discussion. It is said that the meeting was reported by myself on the progress of urban planning in this city, the importance of the western district of Zhabei, the utilization of its railways, waterways, open space, and land replotting, etc. The following resolutions were discussed and made:

(1) The scope, area, and distribution of land use in the western district of Zhabei, as well as the principle of neighborhood units recently approved by the urban planning, are considered generally feasible. (2) The total area of the western district of Zhabei is 2,500 mu, of which roads account for about 15%. After reorganization, the total number of roads, parks, hospitals, and schools has increased to 40%. The 25% of public land increased after reorganization will be expropriated by the government in accordance with the principles recently passed by the Municipal Senate, and will be gradually implemented in districts and phases. After reorganization, the owners will have priority in receiving land in proportion, except for reserved land. (3) The new Land Law promulgated by the National Government stipulates that the government can expropriate public land needed from the people without re-plotting. Although the procedures are quick, they are not fair. A request has been submitted to the Ministry of Interior to consider amending it. In the future, when the government expropriates public land, it can be shared proportionally by the original landowners. When the Zhabei Western District plan is implemented in this city, it is allowed to follow the precedent of land replotting in Xiaguan, Nanjing, to expropriate first and then replot, so as to facilitate the rapid progress of urban planning.

### Zhang Xiaosong Submits a Statement to Defend Against Charges of Election Fraud

[Our Newspaper] The High Court has scheduled a hearing on the 26th for the case of Xie Renzhao and others accusing Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, of election fraud.

### British Merchant Tram Wage Issues - Deputy Director Zhao Issues Statement

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday convened separate meetings in the morning and afternoon to mediate the year-end salary increase issue for over 300 employees of the British Merchant Tram Company, but a resolution has yet to be reached. According to Deputy Director Zhao: "There has always been a difference between the year-end salary increases for staff and workers at the British Merchant Tram Company. In the past, when the basic salary for staff was adjusted from thirty yuan to forty yuan, the workers went on strike for five days. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, an agreement was reached that staff and workers should be treated equally, and future year-end salary increases should be based on the basic salary, eliminating the distinction between staff and workers. This regulation may seem slightly disadvantageous to the staff, but previously, staff salary increases required nomination by department heads, and not everyone was guaranteed an increase. Now, all staff members who have not committed any misconduct can receive a general increase. The current staff request to revert to the 1938 method only considers the disadvantages and not the advantages. The workers do not sympathize with the staff's position. Moreover, all six major public utilities uniformly use basic salary as the standard for year-end salary increases. I have yet to find a convincing reason to persuade the company to yield. If the labor and management cannot reach an agreement, the Social Affairs Bureau will issue a ruling according to the law."

### Commander Fu Zhengmo Returns from Inspecting Two Regiment Jurisdictions - Satisfied with Conscription in Various Counties - Determined to Severely Punish Active Draft Dodgers

Lieutenant General Fu Zhengmo, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, inspected conscription work in Changshu, Wuxian, Wujiang, and Songjiang counties under the jurisdiction of the Wuxian Regiment District, and Kunshan and Taicang counties under the jurisdiction of the Songjiang Regiment District. He departed from Shanghai by car on the morning of the 17th at 9:00 AM, accompanied by Zhou Yuqun, chief of the Conscription Section, and Ge Jianxun, director of military medicine. A Central News Agency reporter accompanied them for the inspection. After three days, he returned to Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Mr. Fu visited each county, questioning officials closely. He paid close attention to the equipment of the conscription stations, the care of new recruits, and the techniques of conscription, providing guidance and corrections to conscription officials at all levels. He was generally satisfied with the conscription work in each county, but still found some significant shortcomings that need to be addressed quickly. This is of great importance to the future of conscription and military operations to suppress the rebellion.

The Wuxian Regiment District's quota for this year is over 8,000 recruits, of which Changshu has a quota of over 3,100, and so far, over 1,500 have been conscripted. Wuxian has a quota of over 3,700, and one-third have been conscripted. Wujiang has a quota of over 1,400, and over 700 have been conscripted. The Kunshan county of the Songjiang Regiment District has a quota of over 900, and 470 have been conscripted. Taicang has a quota of over 1,000, and over 600 have been conscripted. According to officials from each county, all conscriptions can be completed before the end of April this year.

Family Allowance for New Recruits - Up to 30 Dan of White Rice

The amount of the family allowance for new recruits varies depending on the financial resources of each county and township. In general, it can be described as generous, with the highest amount reaching 30 dan of white rice, equivalent to approximately 100 million yuan in cash. The lowest amount is also around 15 dan of white rice. Due to the large amount of family allowances (i.e., white rice) being raised, rice from the countryside has been pouring into urban areas, causing rice prices to fall in recent days.

During the reporter's visit to the various counties with Mr. Fu, the most noteworthy problem discovered was that county-level officials responsible for promoting conscription were not effectively carrying out their duties, and conscription publicity was also lacking. Local public opinion organs still harbor a mentality of perfunctoriness. It is estimated that among the new recruits already conscripted in each county, more than 70% are so-called "volunteers," and the abuses of "volunteers" are therefore unavoidable. The major issues include: (1) Draft dodgers are rampant, creating a situation where there are almost no volunteers without draft dodgers. (2) Active-duty soldiers enlist as volunteers, setting up scams to obtain large family allowances and then attempting to desert. (3) Those who are purely from the fields are mostly overage or do not meet the physical requirements. (4) Communist bandits may have infiltrated the ranks of volunteers to undermine our conscription and conduct counter-propaganda, but so far, none have been discovered.

Enjoying Equal Treatment - Revealing a Look of Joy

Commander Fu has already provided recommendations to the Ministry of National Defense regarding the issue of draft dodgers. Once a draft dodger is caught, if their age and physical condition are suitable for military service, they will be unconditionally ordered to serve in the military, without receiving a family allowance, and their term of service will be extended indefinitely as a form of punishment and to deter others from following suit. If their age and physical condition are not suitable for military service, they will be sent to court for strict punishment. Mr. Fu has also ordered officials at all levels of conscription to thoroughly investigate the origins of volunteers, whether they have national identity cards, or leave passes, etc., to prevent the infiltration of spies and the desertion of new recruits. Those who carry their family allowances with them must be registered and carefully managed. Mr. Fu has convened new recruits several times to give speeches, explaining the meaning of military service and the current tasks, and he has also warned all management personnel to treat new recruits as their own children and to show them affection. According to the reporter's observations, the new recruits were still somewhat fearful when they were at the county conscription stations, but after being received by the new recruit brigade, they fully enjoyed the treatment of regular soldiers, and their state of mind immediately improved.

No Shortage of Good Stories in Conscription - Just Need a Fountain Pen

Among the conscription stations in each county, Kunshan's facilities are better, followed by Changshu and Taicang, and Wuxian and Wujiang are the worst. Commander Fu has separately convened the county magistrates, speakers of the county councils, and party secretaries to discuss improvements, with the minimum standard being "enough to eat and enough to sleep."

There are no shortage of good stories in the conscription process that are worth writing about. For example, Wu Yongsheng, a new recruit from Changshu, did not accept a family allowance and only wanted a fountain pen. Wang Dayong, a new recruit from Wujiang, used ten shi of the 25 shi of rice from his family allowance to pay for his father's funeral expenses, and the remaining 15 shi for his brothers' education. Shen Kanghuai and Huang Junyuan, heads of Taicang County, were the first to conscript their younger brothers, Shen Jinbao and Huang Wukui. The City God Temples in Suzhou and Wujiang counties have seen a surge in incense offerings in recent days, as new recruits and their families burn incense and pray for a safe journey and an early triumphant return. It is also reported that Commander Fu will travel to Jinshan, Songjiang, and Fengxian counties under the jurisdiction of the Songjiang Regiment District within days to continue his inspection of conscription work.

### Armored Strong Force is Growing

[Our Newspaper's Xuzhou 16th dispatch] On the 5th of this month, a reporters group had the rare opportunity to visit the First Tank Regiment under the leadership of Chiang Wei-kuo. This regiment is currently the most powerful unit in our country's armored forces. Its tanks are dispersed into smaller units, operating on various battlefields in East China. The soldiers of the First Regiment excitedly told reporters: They were especially happy that visitors came in March, because it brought back glorious historical memories. It turns out that on March 3, 1944, the Expeditionary Force's tank battalion attacked the Japanese army in Waluban from the India-Burma border. By March 8, they had completely defeated the renowned elite Japanese 18th Division. From that time on, American allies began to believe that the Chinese were qualified to drive tanks and could demonstrate their effectiveness on the battlefield. At that time, Battalion Deputy Commander Zhao Zhihua of the tank battalion is now the Deputy Commander of the First Regiment, using his rich experience to assist Commander Chiang Wei-kuo in leading this new force.

Impression of Chiang Wei-kuo

The impression Commander Chiang Wei-kuo gave us was: young, intelligent, and full of energy in his speech and actions. From the expressions of his conversations with his subordinates, it could be seen that the relationship between officers and subordinates was quite harmonious. He treated us very courteously, saying that except for certain departments, we were free to visit or photograph the rest, but some situations were related to national defense, and he hoped we would not publish them. We met successively with the battalion and company commanders, who led us to visit the various units such as armored vehicles, tanks, and repair shops. The existing tanks were all those that entered the country victoriously from the India-Burma battlefield during the War of Resistance. The Japanese tanks received after the victory were equal to scrap iron due to their deliberate destruction. The American tanks we use can only be considered light tanks by world standards, but they have exerted great power in the military suppression of the rebellion. Some armored vehicles were converted from military trucks. In these areas, it shows that the Chinese people are quite creative. According to the staff, they do not feel a lack of oil and ammunition, but machine parts are indeed in great need of external supply. This is the result of the failure of Secretary of State Marshall's mission to China and the suspension of military aid to China. I told them at the time that this situation would not last too long, because the United States ordered the shipment of military supplies to China starting on March 4th of this year, and the first batch of 2,000 tons was already on its way.

Officers of the Tank Battalion

This is truly a force equipped with American equipment, from weapons to clothing. Even in the enthusiasm of the staff, there is a bit of an American feel. Mechanics wearing work clothes covered in oil climbed in and out from under the armored vehicles, without being sloppy. Their treatment is also quite good, much higher than that of ordinary army soldiers. Everything in the regiment is arranged in an orderly manner, indicating that this is an efficiency-oriented group.

Several officers in the tank battalion have just returned from the front lines of Eastern Henan. They have fought in Shandong and Henan, and have a lot of practical economic experience in suppressing the rebellion. They said that the tanks are usually assigned to certain divisions and commanded by their division commanders. They are not used lightly unless they encounter a major enemy or hear of the annihilation of bandit troops. Every time they are dispatched, they always have considerable gains. Except for a defeat in Southern Shandong last winter, there is very little damage.

Bandit Troops Lack Weapons

The bandit troops currently do not have enough weapons to attack tanks, and they cannot find technicians who can operate tanks. In one battle, a tank of the National Army was deeply mired in the mud of the riverbank and had to be abandoned. After the bandit troops found it, they used several cows to pull it, but they couldn't move it, and finally they left it alone and left. The bandit troops often use dismemberment tortures on soldiers of the National Army's special forces and famous combat units that are captured, which is truly inhuman. Since the autumn of last year, the bandit troops' policy on prisoners of war has been somewhat revised, and they often release batches of captured officers and soldiers of the National Army, wanting to use the temporary psychological aberrations of these people to disintegrate the National Army's morale and fighting will. They deliberately treat them favorably during their period of detention. However, they still kill many pilots and special forces soldiers. As for party and government personnel, they and their families are all targets of persecution.

Another commander of the tank unit witnessed how the bandit troops handled their own wounded soldiers. He said: They do their best to ensure that no wounded soldiers of their own are left on the battlefield. The lightly wounded mobilize a large number of civilians to carry them away and take care of them so that they can return to the battlefield as soon as possible. If they are seriously injured, they do not have enough medical equipment and do not want their troops to see them, so they are often secretly transferred collectively. On the tombstones on the ground, one person's name is used, but underneath is a mass grave of thousands of people!

Expressing Optimism About the Future

Chiang Wei-kuo had a pleasant conversation with the reporter group for more than an hour. He answered and evaded many of the questions raised very appropriately. He said: He usually likes to read books on radio and machinery in his spare time, because radio communication and armored units are too closely related. At the same time, in this era, to lead people, you must rely on your own knowledge and skills. Qualifications and age cannot suppress people. Regarding the future of the Chinese armored forces, he believes that the government's establishment of the Armored Corps Command indicates a long-term plan, so he is very optimistic. In particular, the appointment of General Xu Tingyao as commander is an even more brilliant action by the government. He found it difficult to answer many big questions, and finally made it clear that "don't test him," and everyone laughed it off. We are willing to express our respect for such a young military man with unparalleled support who is willing to run to the front lines of Xuzhou to work hard.

Visiting the Armored Corps School

After leaving the First Tank Regiment, the reporter group specially visited the Armored Corps School, which trains drivers for armored units. After President Hu Xianqun's orderly explanation of each item, a conceptual outline was formed. What is worth mentioning is the scientific nature of the training methods, which fully utilize charts, models, and educational films. Every complex principle is broken down into very simple actions. A person with normal intelligence can easily learn all the courses in a short period of time. President Hu said: "The Americans call this method 'the fool can learn it method'. However, before we are trained, we first have a 'mechanical mind' test, using scientific instruments to calculate the learning ability of each person. If the intelligence is too low, they will not be admitted. Now everything focuses on efficiency, so our training methods, although they make it 'easy for fools to learn', we don't want real fools."

### Suspected Death of Sheng Meizhen - Re-examination Confirms Suicide by Hanging

[Our Newspaper's Wujin 19th Dispatch] Sheng Meizhen of Dongyao Village, Hekou Township, died suddenly and violently. Her mother-in-law and aunt were evasive, and everyone said she had been strangled. After two careful re-examinations by the district attorney's office, an examination was conducted according to law, lasting more than three hours. The rope marks on her neck were clear, and it was determined that she had died by hanging herself. The family members on both sides had no further objections, and funeral arrangements were made.

(Another dispatch) After Sheng Meizhen's violent death, the court's district attorney's office conducted two examinations, and the reports all concluded that she had died by hanging herself. However, Sheng Meizhen's father, Rongsheng, presented reasoned counter-evidence, believing that she had been strangled. (1) The dust on the beam where she was hanging was undisturbed, with no traces at all. (2) The rope provided by the Lu family was a cloth waistband only three feet long, which could not possibly wrap around her neck and be used to hang her. (3) There were obvious rope marks on the front, back, and all around the corpse's neck, proving that she had been strangled. (4) The examiner was seen whispering with the Lu family during the work, indicating bribery. On the 18th, Sheng Rongsheng came to the city to petition the council, requesting further redress. He also published an advertisement, strongly refuting the district attorney's office's inaccurate examination. The dispute is unfolding.

### A Young Man from Taixian Attempts to Evade Military Service - Cuts Off Three Fingers

[Our Newspaper's Taixing 16th Dispatch] Yesterday, a tragic incident occurred in a hotel in the county town in which a man cut off three fingers with a knife to avoid military service. It is said that Zhang Xinfu, a young man from Kongye Township in the Fourth District, had recently arrived in Taixing with a batch of young men from the Fourth District and was temporarily staying at the hotel. Yesterday morning, he suddenly asked the tea room for a kitchen knife and cut off three fingers of his left hand, causing a bloody mess. The district personnel immediately sent him to the military service office for examination, but because he had lost too much blood, the county government sent him to the hospital for treatment. After he recovers, in addition to being punished according to law, he will still be sent to military service as a warning to those who try to evade military service in the future.

### Zhejiang Province Coordinates Construction Year Decides to Supervise by District and Industry

[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou 19th Dispatch] This year is Zhejiang Province's Construction Year.

The government will begin rural supervision next month.

### Problem with Public Grain - Japonica Rice Becomes Indica Rice - Changzhou Council Questions the Department of Agriculture and Food

[Our Newspaper's Wujin 18th Dispatch] The agenda of the county council on the afternoon of the 17th was the work of the Department of Agriculture and Food. As soon as Deputy Director Ding gave an oral report, council members began to question him harshly. They asked in depth about transportation costs, payment of japonica and indica rice, the difference in prices between passenger rice, and how the surplus rice from processing was handled. Deputy Director Ding found it difficult to answer, and the scene was very awkward. Council Member Zou Xigeng recounted the case of a good citizen being killed by a dereliction of duty by a grain official, speaking with passion and tears. It is said that a villager from Wangxia Village carried a stone of grain to Benniu to pay taxes. The office said that it had to be sent to the city. The villager followed the instructions and sent it to Zhengcheng Rice Mill outside the West Gate of the city. Because it was after office hours, the staff refused to accept it. The villager had no relatives or friends to stay with in the city, and he did not bring any money with him, so he had to curl up in a corner outside the Zhengcheng factory wall overnight. The next day, he finally paid the grain at nine o'clock, running home on an empty stomach. It was in the middle of winter, and on that day, he suffered hardship, cold, hunger, and fatigue. He was greatly harmed, fell ill when he got home, and died on the third day. He left behind his wife and children, which was tragic. At that time, for fear of affecting the grain policy, it was kept secret and not reported in the newspapers. Public sentiment was angry, because the villagers had to pay the grain in kind, the regulations were strict, the procedures were complicated, and the japonica rice had to be like pearls, but in the blink of an eye, the public grain distributed was indica rice mixed with weeds and mud. The value differed by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per stone. The difference in more than 200,000 stones of grain was staggering, and everyone felt unfair. The questioning lasted for three hours and was not yet finished. In addition to verbal accusations, the council members also submitted written questions. In the afternoon of the 18th, the discussion of proposals still included the Department of Agriculture and Food's continued report, and they would not let up. All council members believed that the current grain policy had many continuing malpractices, and the villagers were suffering greatly. In order to address the facts and implement the council's mission of promoting and reforming, they decided to form an investigation committee to conduct a thorough investigation and to study appropriate methods with their best efforts.

### Gansu Province Budget Cut, Totaling Over 200 Billion

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 18th] Gansu Province's budget for the first half of the year was originally over 400 billion. However, due to the central government only approving a subsidy of 64.4 billion, the provincial government re-prepared the budget, tightening up on project expenditures as much as possible. Except for continuing and necessary construction projects, all others were temporarily suspended. Even regular operating expenses were reduced as much as possible. The total amount after the budget cut is over 210 billion. According to Chief Accountant Zhu Huang, the budget after the cut prioritizes self-defense, followed by education, administration, and then economic construction. Compared to the previous budget, which prioritized economic construction, it is clear that this budget is based on actual needs. The remaining shortfall of over 90 billion is still planned to be submitted to the central government for subsidies.

### Today's Postal Service

— Li Jinlu

Written to commemorate the 52nd anniversary of the establishment of the postal service.

Our country's postal service originated from the postal transmission system. As early as the Zhou dynasty, there were postal transmission orders. Later, the Qin dynasty built roads in all directions, and postal routes reached everywhere. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, post stations flourished. The Yuan dynasty, with its powerful military force, extended the station system to far-reaching areas. Up until the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were reforms in each era. The formal establishment of the national postal service began sixteen years before the founding of the Republic of China and has now been in operation for fifty-two years.

In ancient times, postal services were only for the use of the wealthy and the military, limited to delivering official documents. Today, the main purpose is to serve the public. No matter who or where, the postal service is there to serve them. Since the restoration of postal services, the country has been in constant turmoil, and transportation has been obstructed. Under such unstable circumstances, postal construction is naturally not easy. Fortunately, the postal service has a tradition of hard work, so even with numerous difficulties, it can still work together and strive for progress under the leadership of the transportation authorities.

Starting in the winter of the 36th year, Minister Yu successively established four major principles for improving postal services and implemented various new measures to achieve them. The major ones are as follows:

(1) Speed: Utilize air transportation of mail as much as possible, establish mobile post offices such as trains, ships, and automobiles, expand postal automobile routes, improve delivery methods, and simplify mail processing operations;

(2) Universality: Increase various types of postal agencies, expand postal routes, develop postal services in border areas, improve rural postal delivery, and set up model post offices, overnight post offices, and holiday post offices;

(3) Safety: Pay attention to protecting mail, work hard to eliminate dead letters, create registered mail and insured mail, and expand air insured mail;

(4) Service: Establish public service agencies to build relationships between the postal service and the public, so that the opinions and requirements of the public regarding the postal service can be understood and accepted at any time, and criticism and suggestions can be used as guidelines for postal service improvements.

The basic spirit of these four major principles is to respect public opinion and be willing to self-reflect in order to improve operations at any time. It is believed that with the full development of this spirit, thinking of the public in every way, and making the postal service a public enterprise, the postal service will naturally reach a perfect state. In the past year, these efforts have yielded some results.

The most difficult things for the postal service today are that transportation is obstructed, making it impossible to fully exert its functions and seek progress, and that economic income and expenditure cannot be balanced. With the current rapid rise in prices, postal rates cannot be adjusted in time. The postal service uses limited income to cope with unlimited expenses, which is a difficult situation to remedy. Therefore, it is cutting manpower, lengthening working hours, saving all expenses, and working hard to expand operations in order to ensure that the postal service, which has been painstakingly created for more than fifty years, can continue to improve and develop universally so that the public can fully enjoy satisfactory postal services. Fortunately, people from all walks of life are coming forward to teach it.

### 76 American Colleges and Universities Offer Chinese Culture Courses, Number of Chinese Lecturers Being Hired Is Increasing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Ministry of Education's investigation of foreign education has received reports that 76 universities and colleges in the United States offer Chinese culture courses, distributed in 29 states (including Hawaii).

They have improved their foreign language teaching techniques, especially for Chinese, which can overcome difficulties in a short period. As a result, the number of Chinese language and culture courses is increasing. The number of Chinese lecturers being hired is also increasing.

### Ministry of Education Cables All Provinces and Cities to Expand Female Teacher Education

Graduates Should Be Hired First

[Dahua News Agency] The Ministry of Education believes that popularizing education is a crucial task that the entire country has unanimously recognized as urgent. Training teachers is a prerequisite for popularizing education. In practice, women are more suitable for engaging in education. In times when educational compensation is meager and life is extremely difficult, women bear a lighter burden and may be content in their positions. Even if they no longer continue in schools after marriage, they can use what they have learned to raise their children, which is also beneficial to the family. Therefore, expanding female normal education and encouraging women to engage in education to increase the source of teachers is beneficial to both school education and family education. To this end, the Ministry of Education has formulated measures to expand female normal education, encourage women to engage in education for life, and has cabled all provincial and municipal education departments to pay close attention to promotion, noting two points that should be noted: (1) Local education finance agencies in various places should set up female normal schools according to the needs of normal schools, and select outstanding female students from elementary and junior high school graduates and encourage them to study. (2) Local education administrative agencies in various places should provide vocational protection and rewards for graduates of female normal schools, and should give priority to hiring them.

### In Memory of Liu Zhan'en

— Lu Shixiong

In modern higher education, degrees serve as milestones, progressing from bachelor's to master's to doctorate. While learning is said to be endless, attaining a doctorate represents the pinnacle of academic achievement, beyond which there is nothing further to add.

Having academic knowledge does not necessarily equate to having integrity. It's even possible that a person with knowledge may become blinded by profit and betray their nation. Looking at the collaborators during the Anti-Japanese War, it's evident that some held doctoral degrees; figures like Chu Minyi and Zhang Sumin exemplify this.

Mr. Liu Zhan'en was a doctor during his lifetime. By sacrificing his life for his country, he became a martyr forever remembered in history. The former highlights the peak of his knowledge, while the latter emphasizes his loyalty and integrity. As an educator embodying both "士" (scholar/gentleman and martyr), he is truly worthy of being a "role model for all ages."

While in Japan, Dr. Liu often likened his role to "gasoline" (汽油) within the educated class, believing gasoline to be the primary driving force in machinery and an essential component in industry. It provides light and cleanses impurities, yet ultimately burns or evaporates itself. Dr. Liu's self-comparison reveals that his sacrifice for the nation and his willingness to die for righteousness were consistent with his long-held aspirations.

It's remembered that the Japanese puppet regime, hating Dr. Liu's anti-Japanese speeches, prompted Wen Zongyao to threaten him, saying, "Hmm, be careful, please avoid the limelight!" However, Dr. Liu refused to seek "prudent self-preservation" by changing his course. He continued his efforts, even one day substituting for an absent English teacher in the middle school, teaching an English lesson on anti-Japanese themes. His strong and passionate patriotism had long placed his personal life beyond consideration.

The authorities of Shanghai University and its alumni association, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of former President Liu on April 7th of this year, felt compelled to honor this exceptional figure. They initiated a 30 billion yuan fundraising campaign to expand the existing library, renaming it the "Zhan'en Library." It is said that two female alumni, whose marriages were officiated by Dr. Liu, are now widows and donated hundreds of millions of yuan each, both to commemorate former President Liu and to honor the memory of their husbands.

In conclusion, education is for cultivating talent for the nation. If talent is used to appease the enemy, it's better to be without talent. Therefore, becoming a traitor after obtaining a doctorate betrays the country's benevolence in nurturing talent. Dr. Liu's legacy is not merely a model for the teachers and students of Shanghai University in a narrow sense, but can be broadly extended to serve as an example for the entire nation.

The National Bank was about the same, but Numbers 224 and 71 and others were still throwing, and the closing price was 1,880 yuan and 1,975 yuan. Compared with the morning closing, delivered shares Yongsha, Rongfeng, Yonggong, and Zhonghui rose slightly, Zhabei, Jinglun, and Xinhua fell by 5%, Huaxin rose by 5%, Xinyi and Lian were flat, and the rest fell slightly. For delivery shares, Jingfu and Qinyu fell by 5%, and the rest fell slightly. Among the unlisted stocks outside the market, except for Zhonghua, Zhongxing, Huashang, Neidi, Pudong, and Feilun, which rose slightly, the rest were flat.

### Foreign Stock Rally Spurs, Unified Bonds and Miscellaneous Brands Fall

Yesterday's rally in foreign stocks was spurred by the reduction in Hong Kong electricity, and both Guangdong gangs and foreign merchants stirred. The securities gangs sold slightly. Yisha opened in the morning at 1.94 million, and at one point was pushed up to a new high of 2.06 million. Finally, it fell back to around 1.97 million. Rubber stocks and industries such as cardboard, Yisha beer, and steel industries were popular, and each had special developments. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the shipping industry was flat and tired, cardboard, Yisha beer, steel industry, and rubber stocks rose by 5%, the industry in Guangdong rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.

Yesterday, a large number of Unified Bonds were sold in rooms 500 and 503 of Dachengxing, and bought in rooms 552, 555, and 360, with a turnover of about 3 million. Miscellaneous brands fell quite a bit, while the Unified Bonds were still stable. The morning opened at 109,000, the high price was 115,000, and the noon closed back to 106,000, compared to the previous closing, Unified Bonds A, B, D, and E fell by 9,000 yuan, and Unified Bonds C rose slightly by 1,000 yuan.

### Trust Companies Suspected of Credit Lending, Must Not Exceed the Specified Ratio

[This newspaper] Recently, the Ministry of Finance found that the credit lending ratios of silver and money trust companies have exceeded the provisions of the Banking Law. Although repeated orders have been issued for correction, there has been no improvement. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance instructed the Shanghai Financial Administration to handle and punish each trust company that violates the regulations by abusing credit lending in the future according to the relevant articles of the Banking Law. It is reported that the administration has already forwarded instructions to the Shanghai Silver and Money Trust Industry Associations, notifying all member trust companies to comply.

### Hong Kong Gold and Exchange Rates

[United Press Hong Kong, 19th] The closing prices of the Hong Kong gold and foreign exchange markets on the 19th were as follows: gold was 338 Hong Kong dollars per tael, one US dollar was 5.78 Hong Kong dollars, one British pound was 13 Hong Kong dollars, and 1.52 Hong Kong dollars was equivalent to 1 million Chinese yuan.

### Suspicion of Small Loans in the Money Industry, Business Operations Must Be Profitable

[This newspaper] The small-amount credit loan syndicate jointly formed by Shanghai money shops started lending on February 3rd, and the business is going smoothly. Now, this reporter learned from the syndicate that from February 3rd to the 17th of this month, a total of 170 applications were received, of which 95 were approved, 71 were disapproved, and 4 were still under investigation and review. A total of 522.4 million yuan has been lent out, and 55.8 million yuan has been recovered. In addition, in order to improve the business, the syndicate specially convened the first design group committee meeting the day before yesterday (18th). 14 committee members including Zou Rangqing attended the meeting and resolved: (1) If the applicant does not have account books, it is allowed to approve the loan after verifying that the guarantor is reliable and that the name on the borrower's registration license matches the name on the identification card, so as to make the syndicate's business popularize to the grassroots of society. (2) Increase the loan amount to 9 million yuan per household to meet the actual needs of small industrial and commercial businesses.

### Factory Silk and Silk Fabrics All Rise, Rayon Similar to the Previous Day

The rayon market was high in the morning and weak in the afternoon yesterday. As a result, the price was similar to the previous day. No. 120, Xu Zi Youguang, opened at 221 million yuan in the morning, once dropped to 17 million yuan, and then rose again. The noon closed as high as 30 million yuan for the spot price. The afternoon opened with transactions at 31 million yuan, and then fell back to a closing sale price of 25 million yuan. Sinia No. 3 Youguang was in the range of 200 to 300 million yuan.

Factory Silk Yesterday, the market rose sharply, and all levels of five-dan goods had no transactions. The C-grade was priced at around 335 million yuan in the afternoon. High-quality another-dan goods, Robinson, Ganxun, etc., were priced at 320 million yuan in the morning, and the asking price was raised to 30 million yuan in the afternoon. The price of high-quality another-dan dried silk was around 270 million yuan.

Silk Fabric Yesterday, the market rose sharply. Huaqiang Zhensi quilt covers opened at 111.7 million yuan, and the market gradually rose due to strong buying interest. The maximum price was 18 million yuan outside the customs, and the spot price closed at 17.5 million yuan. Gete Biku Daheng sheets closed at 440,000 yuan. The factory prices of other silk goods were raised by about 10%, and the rayon goods all stood firm.

### Light-Colored Woolen Fabrics Dominate

Due to seasonal factors, light-colored light gray woolen fabrics and serge are dominant. Buyers need light colors first, resulting in light-colored woolen fabrics continuing to be popular, and the market is much higher than dark colors. The price difference between goods of the same quality, solely due to color, can be as high as 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per yard, which is not uncommon. The markets for other woolen fabrics have very few special ups and downs, and there are few actual transactions. Although the US dollar exchange rate has been adjusted to 255,000 yuan, the market is unmoved because the high interest rate is generally tightening the capital, weakening actual sales. In addition, a large number of rayon, cotton, Japanese goods, and woolen fabrics have been distributed, and buyers are afraid to import goods with high interest rates. However, the principle that one yard of Zhanghua flannel can be exchanged for one load of white rice has now been exceeded, which is also a major factor, and there are signs of thinking about danger at high altitudes.

### The National Economic Council Passes Chemical Raw Material Resolution: If Domestic Production Can Meet Demand, All Imports Will Be Banned

According to Mr. Chen Mousheng, who participated in the National Economic Council's discussion on chemical quotas, the variety of chemical raw materials is complex, making quota allocation extremely difficult. In the past, the Import Control Committee allocated these quotas based on customs statistics from 1947. However, since the war, some chemical raw materials can now be produced domestically, eliminating the need for further imports. To address this, the National Economic Council convened a meeting in Beijing on the 17th with the National Federation of Industries, the Import Control Committee, the Central Bureau of Standards, the Central Testing Laboratory, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to discuss the matter. Based on the opinions submitted by the Industrial Subsidy Department of the National Federation of Industries, the following three principles were adopted:

(1) Raw materials and products that can be produced domestically in sufficient quantities will be absolutely and completely banned from import.

(2) Raw materials and products that cannot be produced domestically but are genuinely needed will have import quotas relaxed according to actual needs.

(3) The import of chemical raw materials and products that are insufficiently produced domestically will be restricted based on careful consideration of the situation. To ensure thorough deliberation, the council has scheduled another meeting in Beijing on Wednesday with relevant departments to make a final decision.

### Market Demand Appears Active: Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Edible Oil Shows a Particularly Sharp Increase

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, due to the rise in prices of all commodities and high production costs, rice merchants were confident, and demand appeared somewhat active. Prices in the southern market rose by over 100,000 yuan per grade, and in the northern market, prices initially rose by 200,000 yuan, then increased by another 50,000 yuan at closing.

Yesterday's registered arrivals were 3,116 shi in the southern market and 5,043 shi in the northern market. Special japonica rice was priced at 3.8 million yuan in the southern market and 3.9 million yuan in the northern market. White japonica rice was 3.605 million yuan in the southern market and 3.8 million yuan in the northern market. Thin indica rice was 3.605 million yuan in both markets, and early rice was 3.5 million yuan. White round-grain rice was 3.705 million yuan in the southern market and 3.7 million yuan in the northern market. Yangxian rice was 3.6 million yuan in the southern market and 3.7 million yuan in the northern market.

Flour: Followed the rise in rice prices, and its increase was even stronger than the previous day. Because prices in Suzhou and Wuxi were high, and wheat prices also reached 2.2 million yuan, all types of flour rose by 40,000 to 60,000 yuan. "Warship" and "Old Car" brands were heavily traded at 1.5 million yuan, while "Jiancheng" and "Red Bee" brands saw considerable activity. Various unbranded flours were in high demand. Wheat bran rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and wheat opened at 2.2 million yuan.

Grains: Generally continued to rise. Due to the rise in rice prices, merchants became more confident, and asking prices increased accordingly. Hankou green beans rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Qingdao buyers showed little interest in corn, and transportation from Yantai was inconvenient, limiting purchases. Thus, the price lacked momentum for increase, remaining at yesterday's level. Red sorghum rose slightly, while broad beans and selected green beans increased marginally. Sesame showed a slight uptick, and raw peanuts continued to rise by 200,000 yuan.

Edible Oil: Continued to soar. Raw oil showed a particularly sharp increase, mainly due to limited supplies and difficulties in procuring new shipments, causing sellers to aggressively raise prices. Qingdao and Jiangbei Ji-brand raw oil both approached the 9 million yuan mark, jumping by 400,000 yuan. Although oil factories released supplies of soybean oil, demand remained high, leading to an increase of 230,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil rose by 300,000 yuan, while refined oil and rapeseed oil each rose by 200,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were sought by Shantou and Taiwanese buyers, as well as individual consumers, making the market very brisk, with prices rising by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

### American Rice Arrives Continuously

[Our Dispatch] The President Company's "Arcadia Victory" (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco the day before yesterday, carrying 21,988 bags of rice, each weighing 100 pounds. It is currently docked at the China Merchants Bureau's northern docks for unloading. Reportedly, a large quantity is en route to Shanghai.

### Preparatory Meeting Held for National Flour Industry Conference

As of yesterday, the preparatory office for the Second National Congress of the National Flour Industry Association has received more than ten proposals from representatives from various regions. Registration began at 8:00 a.m. today, and a preparatory meeting will be held this afternoon to discuss proposal grouping and the selection of presidium candidates. At 7:00 p.m. this evening, a reception will be held for newspaper reporters at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Club. More than sixty representatives from all over the country are attending the conference, and they are already en route.

### China Trust Bureau Purchases Tung Oil: Tung Oil Industry Provides Opinions

To support the China Trust Bureau's policy of resuming tung oil purchases from the 15th of this month to promote exports, the Plant Oil Export Association held a meeting at noon on the 19th to provide suggestions for the bureau's consideration. The summarized opinions are as follows: 1. The current market price of tung oil in Wuzhou and Guangzhou, near smuggling areas, is 5.77 million yuan (Guangzhou) and 6.2 million yuan (Wuzhou) per picul, similar to Shanghai. There seems to be no need to increase the Shanghai price. 2. To stabilize inland oil prices during this period of foreign exchange fluctuation and market chaos, it is best to observe and wait, minimizing transactions to avoid market volatility. Increasing purchase prices at this time could easily trigger fluctuations in tung oil prices in producing areas, increasing difficulties in inland procurement. 3. The current ratio of inland tung oil prices to rice prices is considered reasonable, so there is no need for immediate change. 4. If purchase prices are increased following foreign exchange adjustments, it would encourage tung oil prices, which will not sufficiently increase exports. Such operation will never be regularized. It is therefore advisable to consider the situation carefully and refrain from raising prices for the time being.

### Statistics on Silk and Silk Fabric Exports Last Year

[Our Dispatch] According to statistics from relevant sources, the quantity and value of silk and silk fabric exports last year are as follows:

(1) Raw Silk: 5,190.72 metric tons of mulberry silk, valued at 157,446,601,000 yuan; 29.86 metric tons of tussah silk, valued at 292,914,000 yuan.

(4) Rayon Mixed Fabrics: 13,366.53 metric tons, valued at 100,227,163,000 yuan.

Total exports amounted to 21,860.71 metric tons, with a total value of 359,159,438,000 yuan.

### Cigarettes: Firm at First, Then Weak

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened firmly due to active short covering and some new buying activity. "Ten Great Britain" brands were bid up to 100.2 to 100.3 million yuan with some transactions. Subsequently, as individual sellers took profits at high prices, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company introduced "Bank" and "Dalianzhu" cigarettes. At the same time, remittances from other cities were frequent, and sales increased, causing the market to turn bearish. As a result, "Ten Great Britain" brands fell back to 98.2 million yuan, down 300,000 yuan from the previous day. "Old Knife" brands rose by 400,000 yuan due to healthy demand. Other domestic and foreign cigarette brands generally experienced more declines than gains.

### Anticipation of Further Gains Drives Customer Demand: Yarn Prices Reach New Peaks, Cotton Cloth Inventory Depleted, Prices Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was bullish as customers continued to anticipate further gains. Buyers from Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, and other regions remained active, while local merchants and manufacturers eagerly sought to accumulate inventory, leading to new high prices.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by 5 million yuan at the open, breaking the 200 million yuan mark and reaching 210 million yuan with some purchases. 21-count Double Horse brand yarn opened at 118 million yuan. The Yarn Control Bureau suddenly issued a notice accepting applications from industry members. However, with strong bullish sentiment, there was little inclination to sell. By closing, only 42-count Blue Phoenix and Jincheng yarns saw slight declines, with Blue Phoenix at 200.5 million yuan and Jincheng at 200.3 million yuan, continuing to rise by 10 million yuan and 11.2 to 11.3 million yuan, respectively, from the previous day.

40-count and 32-count yarns also continued to rise by 9 million to 15.6 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse brand yarn for immediate delivery rose by another 7 million to 8 million yuan. 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count yarns generally rose by another 5 million to 14.5 million yuan, closing at high prices.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened with active buying as news spread that a certain cloth merchant had released 700 to 800 bolts of Dragon Head fine cloth, prompting short covering. It was also reported that the Hong Kong exchange rate had fallen sharply, yarn prices had soared, and customer demand was strong. Furthermore, spinning quotas were becoming scarce. The previous day, each household was only allowed to purchase 20 bolts of Silver Moon fine cloth, and only after waiting in line. Market inventory was depleted, and prices rose sharply across the board.

Literature and History

### The Character [] in Oracle Bone Inscriptions

— Zhou Zumo

Shuowen says: "虫, also named 蝮, three inches long, with a head as big as a thumb." Tang Yun pronounces it "xu wei fan." It also says: "它, also a 虫. It lengthens from 虫, representing the shape of a coiled tail. In ancient times, people living in caves feared 它, hence the greeting 'Have you encountered 它?'" Tang pronounces it "tuo he fan." These two characters have different pronunciations. However, in oracle bone inscriptions, "虫" and "它" are the same character, representing the shape of a snake or insect. The character "無齿" can be written with either "它" or "虫," and "一無　" can also be written as "無虫," which is clear evidence. Therefore, there is no doubt that 虫 is pronounced as 它. Shuowen also has the character 　, which says: "The general name for insects. Pronounced like 昆." Tang Yun pronounces it "gu hun fan." The character 　 also appears in oracle bone inscriptions. I have seen it in the following eight instances:

Although the writing of the character "　" in these eight oracle bone inscriptions varies slightly, comparison of the phrases shows that it is the same character, equivalent to the "　" character in Shuowen. The first to seventh instances are from sacrificial oracle bone inscriptions, where the character "　" is likely a person's name. The eighth instance is from an oracle bone inscription inquiring about harm, where the character "　" appears to be a place name. The first three instances were divined at the same time, and the fourth and fifth instances were divined at the same time. The calligraphy is from a very early period, written by diviners during the time of Wu Ding. According to Mr. Dong Yantang's "Yin Li Pu," the character 祭 is written in this way, which is precisely an early style (see Volume 3, page 13 of the upper compilation). However, the people worshiped here are all "　," unlike the former dukes and kings of Yin, because we have not seen him worshiped together with other former dukes and kings in the materials we have. Therefore, I believe that he may be "Zhong Hui" of the Book of Documents. The preface to the "Zhong Hui's Proclamation" in the Book of Documents says: "When Tang returned from Xia, he came to Da Jiong, and Zhong Hui made a proclamation." Everyone knows that Zhong Hui's Proclamation is a forgery, but Zhong Hui was definitely a real person. The "Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo" cited Zhong Hui's words in the twelfth year of Duke Xuan and the fourteenth year of Duke Xiang. Moreover, the "Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo" in the first year of Duke Ding says:

Xue Zai said: "Xi Zhong, the founding ancestor of Xue, lived in Xue and served as the chariot official of Xia. Xi Zhong moved to Pi; Zhong Hui lived in Xue and served as the left minister of Tang."

This is the most reliable record. Therefore, there is no doubt that Zhong Hui lived in the Shang Dynasty and was an ancestor of Xue. So the false Kong Commentary of Shangshu said: "Zhong Hui was Xiang Zuo of Shang, the descendant of Xi Zhong," which is based on the "Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo." Since Zhong Hui was indeed a real person, then there must have been two important ministers during the time of Shang Tang, one was Yi Yin, and the other was Zhong Hui. Yi Yin's name has appeared many times in oracle bone inscriptions and is often worshiped together with Da Yi (see the first piece on page 22 of the Upper Compilation and page 151 of the Fortunate Compilation), so Zhong Hui cannot but be seen in oracle bone inscriptions. Now, from the oracle bone inscriptions mentioned above, it seems that "蚰" is "Zhong Hui."

However, to establish this argument, two questions must be resolved first. First, there are oracle bone inscriptions in which Yi Yin is worshiped together with Da Yi, but there are none for Zhong Hui, which seems suspicious. Second, the character 虺 is pronounced "xu gui fan" in the Shangshu Shuwen, as well as in rhyme dictionaries. The character 　, however, is pronounced "kun" in Shuowen and "gu hun fan" in Tang Yun. The two do not match, and an explanation should be sought.

Regarding the first question, it is difficult to provide a satisfactory answer. It requires the discovery of new materials. Although the existing materials are insufficient to address this, the fact that he can be sacrificed with a burnt offering of sheep and pigs means that he is not just a former duke or king, but a great minister of the state. The fact that 　 is not in the same rank as the former dukes and kings shows that he was an important minister of the state.

Regarding the second question, it seems to be the key, but it is not difficult to explain. We can discuss it in two points:

(1) The pronunciation of the character 虺,

(2) The relationship between 蚰 and 虺 in terms of sound and meaning.

(1) The Shuowen says that the character 虺 is derived from 虫 and the sound 元. The Shuwen pronounces this character as "xu gui fan," which does not match the sound of 元. Therefore, Xu Xuan said: "元 is not a sound, the meaning is unknown." Qing Dynasty scholar Wu Dacheng said in "Xiaoxue Shuo Wen Hui Lue":

"The 'Zhong Hui' in the Shangshu, the 'Annals of Yin Benji' in the Records of the Grand Historian writes it as '仲　,' and the Stone Classics write it as '仲傀,' and the 'Yao Wen' chapter in Xunzi writes it as '中簾.' Shuowen says: '傀 means great,' Erya says: 'Hong Long is ancient, its large ones are called 傀.' 傀 and 歸 both have the meaning of greatness, and since 虺 is commonly used with 傀 薛, then 虺 also has the meaning of greatness; therefore, it is derived from 兀, which is the appearance of being tall. 虫 is the sound. Thus, 　 is the greatest of the Long Gu, 傀 is the greatest of the human body, and 虺 is the greatest of the vipers. Sound and meaning can both be linked."

Mr. Wu's statement best captures the relationship between sound and meaning. The "Yu Pian" has already said that 虫 is an ancient form of the character 虺, which has a unique perspective. Now, from the variants of the character Zhong Hui in the Shangshu cited by Mr. Wu, 雷, 傀, and 薛 are all characters in the zhi rhyme group in ancient rhyme, then 虺 should also belong to the zhi group. Moreover, the "Guo Yu Wu Yu" says: "If you don't break the 虺, what will you do with the snake?" Here, 虺 and 摧 rhyme, and snake and 何 rhyme. 摧 is also a character in the zhi group, which is even more definitive proof that 虺 and 摧 belong to the same group. Yan Zhitui also mentioned the character "螝" in his "Family Instructions," which is also related to the character 虺. The "Family Instructions" says in the "Mian Xue" chapter:

"When I first read Zhuangzi and saw '螝 with two heads,' and Han Feizi's words: 'Among insects, there is the sou, with one body and two mouths, fighting for food and biting each other, eventually killing each other.' I was completely unaware of what this character meant, and asked everyone I met, but no one knew. Later, I saw in Zhang Yi's 'Ancient and Modern Character Glosses' that this was also an ancient form of the character 虺, and after years of confusion, I suddenly understood."

According to this, then Zhang Yi's "Ancient and Modern Character Glosses" takes the 虺 and 螝 as the same character. 魄 is derived from the sound 鬼, and belongs to the zhi group. Thus, it can be further determined that the ancient sound of the character 虺 must have belonged to the zhi group.

(2) Now that we know that the ancient sound of the character 虺 belongs to the zhi group, then the transmitted pronunciation of "xu gui yi xi," is naturally correct. However, the "　" character in Shuowen is pronounced "kun," and "gu hun fan" in Tang Yun, which is different from "xu gui." The case is that the ancient rhyme of the Kun character belongs to the zhun group, and the zhi and zhun groups often have a relationship of mutual transformation. The characters Kun and Hui should be mutually transformed. Because Kun is a 見 sound initial character, and the ancient sound of 虺 also belongs to the 見 sound initial. The variants of the character 虺, 傀廣韻 音公回切, 螝 音居追切, both of which are double sounds with Kun. Moreover, in the poem "What Kind of Person is It?" "To be a ghost or a 蜮," and in the "Rhapsody on the Abandoned City" in the Selections of Refined Literature, "Adding 羅虺蜮," the ghost is used interchangeably with 虺, which is evidence that the ancient character 虺 was pronounced with the 見 sound initial. In terms of rhyme, both Kun and 虺 are closed-mouth sounds. It can be said that all the sound and rhyme categories are extremely close except for the rhyme ending. As for the fact that the current sound of 虺 is xu gui fan, belonging to the 曉 sound initial, is suspicious. If we take the "軍" sound as an example, then it is all cleared. The character 軍 belongs to the 見 sound initial, and characters derived from the sound of 軍, such as 揮 暈 琿, etc., are all pronounced with the 曉 sound initial. Based on this mutual verification, there is nothing strange about the change from the 見 sound initial to the 曉 sound initial. Therefore, the difference in the pronunciation of Kun and 虺 must be due to a relationship of mutual transformation. Logically speaking, the pronunciation of the zhi group should come first, and the pronunciation of the zhun group should come later. If we look at it from the meaning of the character, the 虺 蝮 are often mentioned together by the ancients. The 虺 is the one with the big head of the snake, and the 蚰 character in the oracle bone inscriptions represents the shape of a big head. The writings in the first, second, third, sixth, and seventh pieces listed above are the most obvious. It can be said that the oracle bone character "蚰" and the "虺" used by the ancients are consistent in meaning. Looking at the "　" character in Shuowen, it says "read like Kun," which means that "　" and "昆" are ancient and modern characters. "昆" has the meaning of multitude and abundance, and the oracle bone "　" character from two insects to see its multitude, also the meaning is the corresponding.

From the above discussion, we can draw a conclusion, that is, the "　" character in oracle bone inscriptions is in shape the "蚰" character in Shuowen read like Kun, and in sound should be read as "虺" of Zhong Hui, "虺" was read anciently as "傀" or "螝," "昆" and "虺" are turning of the words. In this way, the second question also has a suitable explanation.

So I might as well boldly assume that "燎如　" of the oracle bone inscriptions is the "仲虺" of the book. However, the assumption is finally the assumption, and I hope that new materials can be added to prove it, and I dare not be sure of myself.

### On the Compilation of Regulations Office of the Secretariat-Chancellery during the Xining Era: A Discussion of the Xining New Policies, Part 1

— Deng Guangming

In the third year of the Jiayou reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty (1058 AD), Wang Anshi, having served as the Judicial Intendant of Jiangnan East Circuit, was appointed Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue. He presented a memorial of ten thousand words, vehemently addressing the affairs of the time. The main points of his memorial can be summarized into three items:

First, the issue of laws and regulations. He believed that although the laws and decrees enforced by the court at the time were strict, they largely failed to align with the governance of the former kings. To emulate the governance of the former kings, one must first grasp their intentions and then revise and reform the detrimental laws of the time.

Second, the issue of talent cultivation. He believed that there was a severe lack of talent in the empire. This made it impossible to implement the court's decrees and even more difficult to reform the empire's detrimental laws to accord with the intentions of the former kings. Therefore, a comprehensive reform was necessary in all aspects of "teaching, nurturing, recruiting, and appointing" talent to ensure alignment with the right principles.

Third, the issue of finances. At the time, it was generally believed that excessive numbers of officials and soldiers led to insufficient national finances. Consequently, most people focused on reducing the number of officials and their salaries. However, Wang Anshi believed that the insufficiency of finances was due to "officials failing to adapt to the changing world and grasp its transformations" and "mismanaging finances." If they could "use the power of the empire to generate wealth for the empire and take the wealth of the empire to supply the expenses of the empire," there would be no concern about insufficient finances.

There was a full decade between the year Wang Anshi submitted his ten-thousand-word memorial and the years he formulated and vigorously implemented various new policies. However, the arguments made in this memorial were, in effect, the basis for his later reforms.

The final section of the ten-thousand-word memorial stated: "However, what I am advocating is not discussed by common custom, and today's commentators deem it impractical and stale... Whenever this is mentioned, they gather and laugh, considering it impractical." These words demonstrate Wang Anshi's contempt for the common views of the general populace. From this, we can also see that not only were Wang Anshi's views entirely consistent throughout, but his firm attitude of refusing to compromise with common views (which his opposition later vigorously promoted as "common custom is not worth worrying about") was also entirely consistent.

Wang Anshi believed that what the former kings diligently studied and upheld was the great ethical principles and fundamental laws. Therefore, among the three main points of the ten-thousand-word memorial cited earlier, Wang Anshi considered revising laws and regulations the most important and fundamental matter. When Wang Anshi gained the emperor's trust and began implementing his policies in the early years of the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty, the first two institutions established in connection with the new policies were the "Office for the Establishment of Regulations for the Three Offices" and the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery." The task of the former institution was to create laws and regulations related to finance and the economy; the latter was to start from the origins of political affairs and first clearly define the powers and responsibilities of the Secretariat-Chancellery.

The establishment process of the Office for the Establishment of Regulations for the Three Offices can be verified from books such as the History of the Song Dynasty. However, the intention and establishment process of the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" are not detailed in the History of the Song Dynasty or the Records of Anecdotes of the Song Dynasty, and it is also missing from the lost volumes of the Continued Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance. The Supplementary Collection of the Comprehensive Mirror also failed to supplement this matter. Only the Draft of the Song Statutes compiled by Xu Song preserves some historical materials about this institution in the department of official posts. Now, based on the records in the Statutes, I will briefly describe the intentions and process of establishing the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" as follows:

Before the reform of the official system in the third year of the Yuanfeng reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty (1080 AD), there were two Secretariat-Chancelleries in the central government: one was located outside the imperial city in the two cloisters, alongside the Department of State Affairs, and like the Department of State Affairs, it was nominal and lacked real power, only occupying a few official residences, with the function of "only managing documents and reviewing and verifying accounts." The other was located on the west side of the court hall in the forbidden city, also called the Hall of Political Affairs, which was where the prime ministers worked. The Secretariat-Chancellery in the forbidden city and the Privy Council jointly managed the military and civil affairs of the empire, collectively known as the Two Bureaus. The "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" established in the early years of the Xining reign was aimed at the Secretariat-Chancellery in the forbidden city, not the one in the two cloisters outside the imperial city.

The duties of prime ministers throughout history were originally to "govern the country and administer state affairs, manage the balance of yin and yang," and they were responsible for overseeing all major plans for military affairs, civil administration, and finances. However, in the first half of the Northern Song Dynasty, not only was military power divided among the Privy Council, but the power over finance was also divided among the commissioners and vice commissioners of the Three Offices. The purpose was to prevent the abuse of power and usurpation that could arise from the prime minister having too much authority. With the prime minister's authority divided in this way, the political affairs of the Song Dynasty prime minister should have been simpler than those of prime ministers in previous dynasties. However, this was not the case.

Before the mid-Northern Song Dynasty, the establishment of officials and the division of duties were very different from those of previous dynasties. In terms of names, it was divided into three categories: "official rank," "position," and "assignment." The so-called "official rank" was only a title used to distinguish social classes, as stated in the Official Posts section of the History of the Song Dynasty: "Official rank is used to confer salaries and stipends, and to indicate position and rank." The so-called "position," such as "Academician of the Jixian Hall" or "Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion," was specifically awarded to people with literary fame and good reputation. Neither of these titles had any practical duties. Those with the title of "Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion" did not actually serve in the Longtu Pavilion; and those who attained the rank of Vice Minister or Minister of the Six Ministries, or even Assistant Minister, did not actually work in that ministry, only holding the title without performing the duties. The actual duties of these people with titles of officials in the central government and various hall and pavilion positions might be to serve as supervisors in various circuits, or to serve as chief officials of various prefectures and military garrisons. This actual duty they undertook was called "assignment." With "name" and "reality" so confused, "official functions" and "responsibilities" became extremely unclear, resembling the "guest appearances" and "cross-dressing" on today's theatrical stage. Just considering the Secretariat-Chancellery, those with the nominal title of officials of the Secretariat-Chancellery were all assigned to agencies outside the Secretariat-Chancellery to "share the various duties," while the affairs of the various departments and offices of the Secretariat-Chancellery were "mostly adjudicated by other officials," meaning that people with titles of officials from other agencies were assigned to serve in the Secretariat-Chancellery. Since the officials were all guest appearances or even cross-dressers, and they were mostly transferred frequently, and there might not even be enough staff at ordinary times, the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery, not only the major issues of "governing the country and administering state affairs, managing the balance of yin and yang," but even minor matters of documents and details, had to be handled personally by the prime minister or executive officials. As a result, the vast amount of detailed work prevented the prime minister and executive officials from having enough time to think about the major plans of the country. Therefore, "clearing up the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery" became a common view among enlightened people who understood the system of governance at the time.

One of the immediate causes for the establishment of the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" was that the accumulation of Secretariat-Chancellery affairs led to mistakes in handling events. The Compilation of Regulations Office section of the Classified Draft of the Song Statutes records the matter as follows:

On the eighth day of the fourth month of the second year of the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong, which coincided with the Heavenly Celebration Festival, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices requested that, as in the fourth year of the Zhiping reign, the officials go to the Gemen Gate to offer congratulations. The Emperor said: "In the fourth year of the Zhiping reign and on the day the spirit carriage of the late Emperor was in the funeral, now the two empress dowagers are celebrating their birthdays. It is not appropriate for the ceremonial officials to cite the examples of mourning. I cannot bear to hear it in my feelings as a son. It should only be said: On the day of the Heavenly Celebration Festival, the prime ministers, civil officials, and military officers should all go to the East Shangge Gate to present memorials." Wang Anshi then said: "This is truly the fault of the Secretariat-Chancellery in failing to review it properly. The affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery are piled up. If an office is not established early and the affairs are assigned to the relevant departments, there is no way to manage it."

The Emperor said to Fu Bi: "If we want to govern well now, we must start with the Secretariat-Chancellery. When establishing an office in the Secretariat-Chancellery, we should carefully select junior officials."

Zeng Gongliang said: "The prime minister's office should use honest and simple people. Therefore, this dynasty does not use graduates of the imperial examinations, but only uses scholars." Wang Anshi said: "We should select outstanding talents from among the lower ranks and have them compile regulations and review documents."

On the fourteenth day of the sixth month, the Emperor said to Wang Anshi: "Establishing an office in the Secretariat-Chancellery to revise the regulations is the most urgent matter."

Wang Anshi said: "This is the root of the matter. Those who revise the regulations must know the kingly principles, understand the national policies, and not be blinded by common custom. Only then can they do it. If people of common custom cannot see beyond common custom, how can their proposals surpass the old ones? Now that Your Majesty wants to revise the regulations, you should first consult widely with the officials and scholars. With Your Majesty's intelligence and wisdom, personally selecting virtuous officials and scholars will surely find the right people. If you can find five or six people to entrust to the Secretariat-Chancellery to revise the regulations, and they present a report every few days, with Your Majesty deciding what is right and wrong, then the establishment of laws and regulations will have a deadline. If you only let the Secretariat-Chancellery choose the people, I am afraid that the people used will be of common custom. How can people of common custom discuss changing the affairs of common custom? All the regulations of today were established by ministers since the late years of Emperor Renzong. How can people be willing to completely change what they have established to follow others? I am afraid that Your Majesty must make a sole decision in order to achieve something."

The Emperor said: "I will wait for myself to select people, but I am afraid it will be delayed."

Wang Anshi said: "This matter cannot be delayed, but it cannot be rushed either. If you do not know the kingly principles, understand the national policies, and are able to change the affairs of common custom, then it is no different from not revising the regulations. This is why it cannot be rushed. However, there are talented people now. You must pay attention to examining and selecting them, and you cannot delay it either."

On the sixteenth day of the ninth month, Li Chang and Lü Huiqing, officials for reviewing and inspecting the regulations, reviewed the compilation of regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery. Previously, Wang Anshi had repeatedly said to the Emperor: "Now the Secretariat-Chancellery is the origin of political affairs. If you want to govern the laws and regulations, it is most urgent to start with the Secretariat-Chancellery. You must first select people to compile the regulations." Therefore, he highly praised Huiqing and Chang and used them both...

The Emperor believed that the court spent too much time reviewing minor details of various departments, while the ministers could not discuss the major issues of political affairs. He believed that matters that could be assigned to the departments should be assigned to them, and the Secretariat-Chancellery should be responsible for their correctness. Then the departments would do their best and the affairs would be well-managed. Therefore, he ordered the Regulations Office to discuss and remove the redundancies. From then on, more and more matters were assigned to the departments, and the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery were cleared up. (Official Posts, 5, 8-11)

To what extent the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery were complicated in the past, and what matters have been cleared up by this "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations," we can find many examples in the Statutes. Now I will take two examples:

Example 1: In the past, for new officials assigned to posts, what the government should provide and what it should reward all had established rules to follow. However, it was still necessary for the Secretariat-Chancellery to verify the established rules and notify the Three Offices to issue them. The same was true for members of the imperial clan who were newly assigned posts or titles. The Compilation of Regulations Office believed that this was a matter that "should be assigned to the relevant departments" and made changes. Afterwards, regardless of whether officials or members of the imperial clan were newly assigned posts, the Three Offices would directly handle the due stipends and rewards according to the established rules.

Example 2: People with titles in the capital who were assigned to serve as civil administrators or general affairs officials in the circuits and military garrisons, if they requested leave for matters such as relocating graves, in the past, it was necessary for the Transport Office to report to the court, and then the Secretariat-Chancellery would issue a special imperial decree to approve it. The Compilation of Regulations Office believed that this was also a matter that "should be assigned to the relevant departments" and made changes. Afterwards, for those personnel who requested leave for matters such as returning to bury their ancestors, it was only necessary for the Transport Office to verify the facts and grant leave, and there was no need to wait for the Secretariat-Chancellery to issue a special imperial decree.

Although the Statutes recorded dozens of redundant affairs that were cleared up by the Compilation of Regulations Office, there must have been many more that were not recorded. Therefore, we still cannot know how many items were cleared up in total. On the twenty-second day of the tenth month of the eighth year of the Xining reign, when Wang Anshi had already been dismissed as prime minister for a year and a half, this Compilation of Regulations Office was abolished along with the "Office for Revising the Regulations of the Ministry of Revenue" because it "demanded documents, harassed the official agencies, and did not contribute to the actual situation."

The Separate Records of Official Systems section of the Song Statutes contains a preface to the Official Posts section of the Veritable Records of Emperor Shenzong, which states:

Emperors Taizu and Taizong corrected the abuses of regional military commissioners and garrison commanders, and then sent officials such as Assistant Ministers and Directors of Ministries to lead posts outside [the capital]... The dynasty continued this practice without making any reforms for more than a hundred years, and the officials gradually lost their substance... When Emperor Shenzong ascended the throne, he wanted to greatly improve this, saying that the Secretariat-Chancellery was the foundation of political affairs. He first established the Office for the Establishment of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery and set up five offices of inspection officials to clear up the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery. He also established the Office for the Establishment of Regulations of the Three Offices to manage the finances of the empire... Therefore, the laws and regulations were clear, and the schools and academies flourished... The practical measures for governing and managing officials were truly abundant, but the names were not yet rectified.

This passage says that although the reform of the official system was only implemented during the Yuanfeng reign, during Wang Anshi's administration in the middle of the Xining reign, he had already started from the practical aspects to "correct" the official system. Clearing up the redundant affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery through the "Office for the Establishment of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" was considered a major event in reforming the laws. If we evaluate all the work of the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations," we feel that this passage from the Veritable Records of Emperor Shenzong is an excessive praise. Because the establishment of this "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" was aimed at reforming the laws, and in Wang Anshi's original intention, he wanted the new laws to "conform to the governance of the former kings." Although the redundant affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery at that time should be reformed, the most fundamental issues concerning the laws were definitely not this matter. Issues such as "the Chancellor of the Secretariat not participating in court affairs," "the Vice Minister not leading the ministerial duties," "the remonstrating officials having no responsibility to speak out, and the recorders not taking notes," "the Secretariat-Chancellery often closing its doors," and "the remonstrating officials and upright speakers not performing their duties of remonstrance," that is, what is called "holding the office without knowing the duties," "the matters entrusted being lost by two or three out of ten," and the abuses of "name and reality being confused, and the number of personnel being redundant and excessive," these were the most urgent tasks that should be "revised and reformed." The Compilation of Regulations Office, by abandoning these most fundamental issues and only slightly clearing up the redundant affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery, cannot be considered as abandoning the essential for the trivial.

### Explanation of the Ranks and Salaries of the Zhou Dynasty in the History of the Sui Dynasty's Treatise on Officials

— Chen Yuan

Writing is intended to be easily understood, but during the Northern Zhou Dynasty, there was a period of revival of antiquity, where extremely obvious facts were described in extremely roundabout language, such as the section on the ranks and salaries of the Zhou system in the twenty-seventh chapter of the History of the Sui Dynasty's Treatise on Officials. Now, I will first cite the original text and then explain it as follows:

The Zhou system: For ranks and salaries, the lowest scholar received 125 shi of grain. Middle scholars and above, up to Grand Masters, each doubled that amount. Grand Masters received 4,000 shi.

Ministers received an additional one-half, dukes received an additional one-third, and lords received an additional one-quarter, each adding one to their respective amounts. Lords, based on the rounded figure, received 10,000 shi.

The ninth rank received 120 shi. From the eighth rank to the seventh rank, and for every two ranks below, each decreased by one-sixth, with the second ranks receiving 40 shi.

"Middle scholars and above, up to Grand Masters, each doubled that amount" means that middle scholars received 250 shi, upper scholars received 500 shi, junior grand masters received 1,000 shi, and middle grand masters received 2,000 shi.

"Ministers received an additional one-half, dukes received an additional one-third, and lords received an additional one-quarter, each adding one to their respective amounts" means that ministers received an additional one-half of the grand master's amount, making 6,000 shi; dukes received an additional one-third of the minister's amount, making 8,000 shi; and lords received an additional one-quarter of the duke's amount, making 10,000 shi.

"From the eighth rank to the seventh rank, and for every two ranks below, each decreased by one-sixth" means that for every two ranks below the eighth rank, each decreased by one-sixth of the ninth rank's amount. Therefore, the eighth and seventh ranks received 100 shi, the sixth and fifth ranks received 80 shi, and the fourth and third ranks received 60 shi. The second and first ranks received 40 shi. I initially suspected that there was a missing character in the last sentence of the original text, which should have been "the first and second ranks received 40 shi." Later, according to the "Ranks and Salaries" section of the Comprehensive Institutions, and the section on stipends and salaries in the General Record Office Volume, which both cite "the first and second ranks both received 40 shi," I know that the current edition of the History of the Sui Dynasty actually omits the words "first rank." My doubts are now cleared. If we list this as a table, it will be immediately clear.

Table of Ranks and Salaries of the Later Zhou Dynasty:

Lower Scholar 125

Middle Scholar 250

Upper Scholar 500

Junior Grand Master 1,000

Middle Grand Master 2,000

Grand Master 4,000

The amounts above are each doubled.

Minister Duke Lord 6,000 8,000 10,000

The amounts above increase by 2,000 shi each.

Ninth Rank 120

Eighth and Seventh Ranks 100

Sixth and Fifth Ranks 80

Fourth and Third Ranks 60

Second and First Ranks 40

The amounts above decrease by 20 shi.

### The Year of Wang Tao's Death

— Xu Guangmo

Tiannan Dunsou Wang Tao was born in the eighth year of the Daoguang reign, 1828 AD. However, there is still no reliable record of the year of his death. Mr. Hu Shi said in his Outline of Chinese Literary History that he "died in the twenty-first year of the Guangxu reign" (page 330). According to my investigation, this is a mistake.

Hong Shen's article "Evidence of Mao Zhuangyuan Wang Tao, the Chief Editor of the Shen Bao" (see the second volume, sixth issue of Literature published by the Life Bookstore), written before the war, did not ascertain the month and year of his death. I have been paying attention to materials in this area, and finally, in the preface of a not-so-noticeable Plum Orchid Prose Collection, I solved this question.

Plum Orchid Prose Collection is a small-sized typeset collection of poems written by Xu Zhaolan. Xu was from Wu County and a fellow villager of Wang Tao. The collection records their close friendship. There are seven prefaces in front of the collection. In addition to one written by Xu himself, the other six were written by Wang Tao, Yu Yue, Chen Dejun, Miao Shaochu, Wu Guangxu, and Liu Jiashu. The preface written by Wang Tao is dated to the year Gui Si of the Guangxu reign, i.e., the nineteenth year. The preface written by Yu Quyuan is dated to the year Yi Wei of the Guangxu reign, i.e., the twenty-first year, and says:

"In the spring of Yi Wei, Mr. Xu and Dunsou of Tiannan visited me at the Chunzai Hall in Wumen, and took out the Plum Orchid Prose Collection and asked me to write a preface for it..." From this, we can know that Wang Tao was still alive in the twenty-first year of the Guangxu reign. Miao Shaochu's preface has the following words: "You (referring to Mr. Xu) were skilled in imperial examinations from a young age and loved poetry. You were friends with Dunsou of Tiannan and Chameshan Ren, and often pursued each other in poetry and wine... Chameshan Ren has passed away, and Dunsou returned to Daoshan this autumn. I lament the difficulty of meeting old friends again and admire the new poems as brocade..." This preface is signed "Winter of Ding You of the Guangxu reign, Miao Xunlian of Lushan Shaochu recorded." Ding You is the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign, so Wang Tao died in the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign. This question has finally been resolved. (Drafted on the night of the heavy snow on January 23 of the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China in Lilin)

Editor's Postscript

Mr. Xu Guangmo sent this short article from Xuancheng, letting us know that Wang Tao died in the Ding You year, the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign, 1897 AD. Many scholars will welcome this small textual research. The newly published "Eminent Chinese of the Ching Period" (edited by Arthur W. Hummel) in the United States in recent years has a biography of Wang Tao written by my friend Roswell S. Britton (pages 836-839), saying that he was born on November 10, 1828 (Gregorian calendar), but it also did not ascertain the year of his death. Last year, I heard that a friend in Shanghai had already ascertained that Wang Tao died in the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign, at the age of seventy. I recorded his death in this year on my World Events Chronology, but I did not note the source or who ascertained it at the time. (I would be grateful if someone could point it out.) Mr. Xu Guangmo's citation of Miao Menglian's preface to the Plum Orchid Idle Prose Collection is credible evidence. Although Wang Tao was not a "Mao Zhuangyuan," he was indeed the lead writer of the Shen Bao. I hope that the editorial department of the Shen Bao can take the time to look through the old newspapers from the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign and give a final conclusion to the year of Wang Tao's death. Hu Shi. 37, 2, 25.

After thoroughly searching this newspaper from January of the 23rd year of Guangxu to March of the 24th year of Guangxu, there is no record of Wang Tao. There is only one advertisement on November 4th of the 23rd year of Guangxu, which reads: "Skilled in medical skills," with the inscription "Elegant appreciation of Renxiong Sima of Jinghu," and the signature "Dedicated by Tiannan Dunsou Wang Tao," likely inscribed for a doctor, but it is not enough to prove that he was still alive at this time. -- This newspaper's archives

### "Carriage Driver" and "Driver"

— Jingwen

The cancellation of the title "Automobile Carriage Driver" and its replacement with "Driver" has already been formally announced by the relevant authorities. Although this is a small issue, it has caused many storms in the mainland and Shanghai. "Driver" originally referred to a skilled worker. In the past, they were regarded as "laborers" simply because people serving others have always been tagged with the suffix "fu." For example, school workers were called "Zaifu" in the past, sedan chair carriers were called "Jiaofu," cooks were called "Huofu," and those who pulled and drove vehicles were all called "Chefu."

However, in my opinion, the term "fu" is not necessarily bad. For example, people in the north call doctors "Daifu," and women in the past hoped to become first-rank "Furen." If someone respectfully called you "Fuzi," you would definitely not consider it an insult. And those who devote themselves to serving their wives are called "Zhangfu," and upright men are called "Dazhangfu." This shows that the single character "fu" has so many uses. Moreover, the rise and fall of a nation depends on the contributions of every "Pifu," which further illustrates that every citizen of the country is a "Fu."

Since the term "fu" is not bad, it seems unnecessary to quibble over the term "driver" instead of "Automobile Carriage Driver." However, the issue is not so simple, because you and I both know that in the past, most people's use of the term "Automobile Carriage Driver" carried a certain amount of disrespect. After the Anti-Japanese War, under the slogan of "a drop of gasoline is a drop of blood," the social status of drivers in the rear areas became increasingly important, which changed people's past perceptions. Moreover, drivers are indeed in charge of the machinery, and they are ultimately different from those who rely solely on human power to pull vehicles. Therefore, to be consistent with the facts, it is indeed more appropriate to use the term "driver."

Europeans and Americans call automobile drivers "Chauffeur," and the Japanese call them "Untenshu." The origin of the word "Chauffeur" is not very clear, but I believe that the three characters "Untenshu" seem to be more descriptive and appropriate than the two characters "Driver." This shows that the Japanese are indeed a little clever in many ways.

However, although rectification of names is important, raising the social status of a profession cannot be achieved simply by making superficial changes in the name. Whether in Europe, America, or Japan, driving a car has the same social status as other professions and is equally respected. Not only is this true for drivers, but also for other people who earn a living through skills or labor. They are rarely discriminated against by society, and there is no sense of insult over the name due to professional status.

I believe that the sense of insult over the name of a profession stems partly from the unequal factors that still exist in society, and partly from the professional ethics and professional atmosphere of the practitioners themselves. Especially in today's society in our country, professional ethics and the professional atmosphere have a great impact on the social status of a certain profession.

In the past, the rewards of a profession were often seen as the dividing standard of professional status. It seemed that the more money one earned, the higher the profession. For example, the ranking of scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants reflects this mentality. In the past, being an official was a first-class profession, a privilege of "scholars," the so-called "learning leads to officialdom." Next was the salaried class in long gowns. Customs, post offices, and banks were all "golden rice bowls" at the time. Even school teachers were a remarkable profession in the past.

But now it is different. If we use the past standard of dividing professional status by the amount of money earned, then today's working class should undoubtedly occupy the throne of the professional world. Those who were remarkable in the past have now completely reversed their positions. Therefore, in terms of profession, today's workers have no need to feel inferior. However, raising the social status of a profession is not entirely determined by rewards, but by professional ethics and atmosphere.

To fight for the honor of a profession, rectification of names is naturally important, but rectification of names is not only for the sake of the name, but should also emphasize raising the professional ethics and reputation of the profession. No matter what system is changed in the future society, those who live by skills and labor will always be the pillars of society. By improving one's professional cultivation under this belief, one can break through any social prejudice and self-inferiority.

### Anecdotes about Marshall

— Yingmin

One day, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall drove to a gas station to refuel. After the car was filled up, they were about to drive away when a military vehicle drove up and blocked their way. Two corporals jumped out of the car and stood outside the car window chatting and laughing with their girlfriends, seemingly very happy.

After waiting for five minutes, they were still talking. Finally, Marshall stuck his head out and said, "Please move your car a little to let me out."

The two soldiers glanced at him, but turned their heads to talk to their girlfriends. After a while, the four of them walked into the gas station together, leaving the car parked there. As they passed Marshall's car, they said to him, "Buddy, be civilized!"

Fifteen minutes later, they returned home, and Mrs. Marshall explained to her daughter why they were late. The daughter asked, "What did Dad do?" Mrs. Marshall said, "He was very civilized!"

### White-Collar Class

— Ji Mo

Several years ago, while reading a political and economic history written by an American, I encountered terms like "capitalism" and "petty bourgeoisie," which felt somewhat peculiar and novel at the time. Then, I came across the term "white-collar class."

The translation of "white-collar class" seems to be a direct one. Indeed, there are many people in our country who wear Western suits with snow-white collared shirts. However, if we translated it as "long gown class," it might be easier for us to understand. If we further interpret "long gown class" as "salary class," then looking around society, people bustling to and fro are everywhere, and we can feel a personal connection.

Since World War II, the treatment of the white-collar class has been inferior to that of the non-white-collar class, or the working class. A newly established publishing company in the United States created a comparative statistical chart of the incomes of the two groups from 1940 to September 1947. In 1940, the difference was limited, but from 1941 onwards, it gradually widened, reaching a significant gap by 1944. After the war ended, the former's treatment rapidly caught up, but before long, it once again showed a trend of being out of reach. As of the third quarter of 1947, the two still differed by about 20 percent.

As a result, a recent trend in the United States is that many employees of securities firms, power companies, insurance companies, and the like are inclined to shed their white shirts and switch to factories. "Office work" is no longer as attractive as it once was.

The other day, I went to an enterprise company to see a friend who works there as an accountant. Wearing a suit, he can be said to be a standard white-collar worker. I talked to him for a while, perhaps because soap prices have risen too sharply these days, and I noticed that his shirt had not been washed for a long time, the collar turning a patch of gray. I think in a few more days, this white-collar worker may not be far from becoming a black-collar worker, assuming we even have this kind of distinction of a black-collar class.

### Appreciating "Greatness"

— He Ku

On behalf of a friend, I went to the bank to withdraw a remittance of ten million yuan. What I received was a stack of red five-thousand-yuan Guan Jin notes, effortlessly placed in a bag without feeling any weight. Although I have seen these banknotes for over three months, it was the first time I had such a neat stack in my own bag, even if only temporarily. I still felt very poor.

This banknote can now only buy twenty sesame cakes, barely enough for one person's daily sustenance. However, in the poems of ancient people, it would have been enough to travel to Yangzhou in the second month of spring to enjoy the flower season: "With a hundred thousand strings of cash around my waist, I ride a crane to Yangzhou." Its luxury is equivalent to taking a tyrant's plane to Beijing for a pleasure trip. Therefore, in terms of numbers, our era is great enough. No wealthy ancient person, from Deng Tong and Ji Ran to the Qing Dynasty's eunuch Heshen, had as much money as one of our civil servants today. What's so rare about a hundred thousand strings of cash? It's only worth over three hundred yuan today, an amount that even beggars on the street would disdain!

Westerners consider millionaires to be extraordinary figures. However, today, the income of any small clerk can at least match several Western "millionaires." From this point of view, the comfort and honor of Chinese and foreign people are only worth our scorn. Many things that caused a sensation in the past are now laughable. There's no need to look at old historical accounts. Take the recent events of twenty years ago: the wife of a mayor in Nanjing bought a pair of silk stockings for twenty-five yuan, and it was treated as news, with people praising and envying, criticizing and attacking, ridiculing and mocking, and discussing the impropriety of the official's conduct. It was a lively period. From today's perspective, if I were to buy a pair of ordinary cotton socks, the cost would be exactly one of the red bills mentioned above, totaling one hundred thousand yuan. However, it would not become a sensational news item, nor would anyone attack my conduct as being improper, doubt whether my income was illegal, envy my luxurious enjoyment, or sneer at my inappropriate status. The key is that everyone has to buy socks for one hundred thousand yuan a pair. A mere twenty-five yuan a pair is like asking a paper shop to make a pair for use as grave goods, and the shop would definitely refuse it. In the past, twenty yuan a pair of socks could constitute news. Today, one hundred thousand yuan a pair has become a common phenomenon. That's why I say this is the greatness of the era. If the government reforms the monetary system, then the huge numbers will come to an end. The great era will be cut into segments, and this segment will have a name: "unprecedented."

I think today's monetary figures should be appreciated more than used practically. In other words, the view of today's currency is akin to quenching thirst with plums. "Thirst" represents great wealth. When you think about the numbers, you feel like you are living the life of a millionaire.

### Talking About Romance of the Three Kingdoms Operas

— Yi Hong

When Peking opera troupes came to Beijing in the early years, the Sanqing Troupe (now known as the Old Sanqing) was the most renowned for its talent. The troupe had three leading male actors, one from the Han school, Yu Sansheng, one from the Hui school, Cheng Changgeng (known in the troupe as the "Big Boss"), and the third was Lu Shengkui (called "Lu Taizi" by his peers).

Lu Taizi was originally a failed scholar who was well-versed in literature. He felt frustrated by his inferior position. However, given the environment in the troupe, he could not compete with Cheng and Yu for prominence. When he was not performing in the main scenes, he played supporting roles for Cheng and Yu, such as the Sixth Prince in "Visiting His Mother," Wang Ba in "Fighting at Puguan," Chen Jingsi in "Pearl Curtain Fortress," and Gongsun Chujiu in "Searching for the Orphan." He was essentially placed in a supporting role, what is now known as the second-tier old male role. Lu always felt this was regrettable. So, he secretly consulted Romance of the Three Kingdoms and specially wrote a complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms play, starting from Zhuge Liang's debate with the scholars and ending with Kongming's death during the star-arranging ritual during his final military campaign. After the play was written, he sought advice from the Big Boss. Cheng greatly valued it and first staged the "Heroic Assembly" scene. The cast included the Big Boss as Zhuge Liang, Yu Sansheng as Lu Su, Xu Xiaoxiang as Zhou Yu, Qian Shifeng as Huang Gai, and Liu Gan San as Jiang Gan. Lu also played both Zhuge Liang and Lu Su. After this play was test-performed, it became very popular. The Big Boss saw that Lu's movements in the play were vivid and lifelike, and he shifted his attention to Lu and greatly appreciated him. Later, when Romance of the Three Kingdoms was performed again, Lu was assigned to play the leading roles in the play, and his reputation soared. From then on, Lu was able to make a name for himself in the theatrical world.

The complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms is divided into twenty-three parts, which can be performed over twenty-three days. According to opera troupe tradition, every year in the twelfth lunar month, because of the cold weather and lack of heating in the theater, the audience feared the cold. Without good plays, it was difficult to fill seats. Only performing this play could maintain attendance. After Lu Taizi wrote the new complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms play, the Big Boss believed that it could fill seats, so he staged the play in the twelfth lunar month, starting from the first day of the month and performing it for twenty-three days straight, regardless of wind or snow, one part each day, finishing on the twenty-third day, the Kitchen God Festival. The last part was the closing play. This play was vivid and complete, combining civil and military elements, and featuring various opera styles. It was the most wonderful of the troupe's plays. The Old Sanqing performed this play once a year. Every time it was performed, the upstairs boxes were reserved in advance, and even the general seating area was filled with long-term spectators, which shows the true value of this play.

In the late Qing Dynasty, after the Old Sanqing disbanded, no one performed this play for a time. It was not until Ye Chunshen founded the Fuliancheng Opera School and found the original script that he continued to stage the complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It was first performed by the Xi generation, but it was not very good. When the Lian generation, such as Ma Lianliang, Cheng Lianxi, Luo Lianxiang, and Su Lianhan, performed it, it was better than the initial performance. However, when they performed it, they could not perform the entire play to the end, stopping after the "Battle of Changsha," which was a shortcoming. Among them, Ma Lianliang's male roles, Cheng Lianxi's young male roles, Luo Lianxiang's military roles, and Su Lianhan's painted face roles all had their merits. Later, when the Fu and Sheng generations performed it again, they were not as talented as the Lian generation. The Shi and Yuan generations focused on female roles and did not value the Romance of the Three Kingdoms play. After Fu Sucheng disbanded, the complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms could no longer be performed in its entirety because it was difficult to gather the necessary roles. What can be seen on stage now are only excerpts. It is no longer possible to see the whole picture.

### Abolishing the Death Penalty and Life Imprisonment

— Shi Wen

Last year, the Soviet Union's abolition of the death penalty and life imprisonment received close attention from around the world. As a result, the United Kingdom also considered abolishing the death penalty, but the effort failed.

Let's see what happened after the Soviet Union abolished the death penalty.

Recently, a Soviet military court in Berlin tried fourteen Nazi war criminals. These fourteen devils had slowly tortured to death one hundred thousand innocent men and women in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The evidence was solid, and the defendants all confessed.

Logically, murderers should die, especially these fourteen devils, whose victims numbered as many as one hundred thousand! However, at the sentencing, each of them escaped with their lives—receiving twenty-five years of imprisonment.

Twenty-five years of imprisonment is already the heaviest sentence currently in the Soviet Union. The judge had no choice but to sentence them that way, but he himself was also gnashing his teeth in pain, admitting that he had given too light a sentence.

### A Fleeting Romance

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Twelve: A Chance Encounter (103)

The next day, Qi Wan came to Liu Ru's house. Liu Ru said to Qi Wan, "During our conversation yesterday, I could see that what Dao Yun said was unreliable in all likelihood. He said that the headquarters were in Hong Kong, and you can go to Hong Kong with him to see for yourself. If what he said is empty, find a way out as soon as possible and don't ruin your future, because I've heard that he's already married. Whether his family is in Hong Kong or not, I don't know very well. As long as you get to Hong Kong, the whole truth can be revealed." Qi Wan said, "I also suspect him very much. When I go back today, I will ask him to go to Hong Kong and see what he says. If he has ulterior motives, he will definitely try to avoid going, and I can break up with him." Liu Ru said, "Don't be so reckless. You might as well observe the situation. Your first step is to ask to go to Hong Kong, and when he doesn't agree, you can come back and discuss it with me." After the mother and daughter agreed, Qi Wan went back and saw Dao Yun busily packing his things. Qi Wan was very surprised and asked, "What are you packing these things for?" Dao Yun said, "My ship ticket has already been booked, and I'm going to Hong Kong tomorrow." Qi Wan was surprised to hear this and asked, "Really?" Dao Yun smiled and said, "Isn't that what we planned? After a couple of days in Shanghai, we have to go to Hong Kong. Our headquarters are in Hong Kong, and we can't delay any longer, because there are many things that need to be resolved when I get to Hong Kong." Qi Wan was surprised by what he said and said, "That's good. We'll leave tomorrow. I have to tell my mother." Dao Yun said, "I think the old lady will be reluctant to see you come to Shanghai for a few days and then go to Hong Kong. You have to tell her slowly that we'll be back soon. After we come back, we'll have a big party." Qi Wan smiled when she heard what Wu Yun said, which was beyond her expectations, and said, "I've already told my mother. When my mother heard that your headquarters are in Hong Kong, she also wants me to visit and report back to her, so that she can be happy." Dao Yun was stunned when he heard this and asked, "Your mother is probably very interested in my Hong Kong headquarters, right?" Qi Wan said, "Of course." Dao Yun said, "It's still in the early stages, and there's nothing to see. It will be at least half a year before there are any results." Qi Wan saw that his words were not as exaggerated as they had been in Beijing, and she knew that he had become timid. She still smiled and said, "You don't have to be polite with me. I know you have many friends. Many big tycoons in Hong Kong are your backers." Dao Yun said, "Things are not that simple. You'll know when you get there!" Qi Wan didn't say anything more and just helped Wu Yun pack the things he needed to bring. The next day, the two of them went to Liu Ru's house to say goodbye. Liu Ru secretly repeatedly urged Qi Wan to observe the situation in Hong Kong and not to condone anything, and to make a decisive decision. That day, she treated the two of them for half a day and personally sent them on board before returning home. (End of chapter)

### Husband Sacrificed for the Country, Appealing for Employment, Received Higher Education and Excellent Knowledge

Editor: I am a family member of an anti-Japanese war officer. Unfortunately, my husband was killed in action in the Battle of Myanmar in December 1943. At that time, there was also a two-year-old boy. The widow and orphan have since lived a miserable life. Initially, the rear headquarters (my late husband graduated from the student army) provided a compensation of one million yuan. The state's pension until 1946 was less than 700,000 yuan. Last year's pension, entrusted to someone or received in person, took three months, and the food subsidy included only 420,000 yuan. How can our mother and child live on such a small pension!

Originally, there were also in-laws to rely on, but they did not recognize this woman who married freely outside, nor did they recognize this fatherless orphan. After repeatedly asking people to plead, they still could not get the in-laws to take them in, which is heartbreaking! The union of our husband and wife was the result of more than three years of love. I am a woman who has received higher education, and my late husband was an American overseas Chinese. At first, all the classmates envied our happy marriage. Now, does society pity our mother and child?

I am thirty-five years old this year, and the child is so young. How can I spend the years to come? Originally from Fujian, living in Sichuan, now wandering in Shanghai, I hope for the help of benevolent gentlemen to give me a job, whether it is teaching (Chinese, history, geography, civics) or being a housekeeper, nanny, or family secretary, I can handle it. As long as I can live, that's enough. I don't want any reward. Please publish an advertisement in your newspaper to appeal for help. Yours sincerely, Gu Qing, an unfortunate person.

### Two Stories from the Old Capital

— Banmeng Laoren

Matters of gods, immortals, and ghosts are mostly vague and unclear. Some people believe they are real, while others believe they are completely false. It is impossible to provide definitive proof of what is real and what is not. When we were young, we read Pu Songling's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, and we always thought that his writings were nothing more than fabrications, and that there could not be such bizarre things in the human world. But when we thought of "the vastness of the world, full of wonders," we didn't dare to say for sure that they didn't exist.

In 1930, I lived in Mingwa Lane (a place name) in Nanjing with five or six good friends, each occupying a room. They all said that my room often made extremely loud noises at night, as if someone was slamming their hand on the table in anger, or as if someone was pacing back and forth on the floor, the sound of shoes pounding. But when I slept in this room at night, I always slept soundly and never heard any movement. I thought that what they were saying was mostly fabricated. However, a friend named Wu, who was old and suffered from a long-term cough, often couldn't sleep all night. He especially thought that this was indeed the case and had heard it more than once. He repeatedly advised me not to stay in this room anymore, fearing that something ominous would happen in the future. It was a good intention, and although I didn't believe it, he didn't object. Because I had never seen it or heard it myself, they insisted on it, so I just listened to it as a story.

Later, after I retired and returned home, I happened to meet an old colleague from Beijing, Mr. So-and-so, who talked about the strange news when Mr. Chu, whom we all knew well, died (I had heard about it at the time, but it was vague). It turned out that Mr. Chu had first worked in the Supreme Court (formerly called the Daliyuan), and later also served as a counselor in the Ministry of Justice, working at a desk in the counselor's office of the Ministry of Justice. He was very honest and always arrived early every day, which everyone in both departments knew.

Who knew that Mr. Chu suddenly died of illness one Sunday in winter, very quickly and unexpectedly. At that time, everyone didn't know much about it. The next day, Monday, Mr. Qian, a counselor in the Ministry of Justice, went into the counselor's office first when he arrived at the ministry in the morning, took off his coat, and washed his face. When he turned around, he saw Mr. Chu sitting at the desk, with a child standing next to the desk. Mr. Qian had always seen him arrive very early, and although there was a child, he didn't think it was strange (because people often brought children to the ministry at that time). After turning around, he went into another room and saw a mourning notice for Mr. Chu on Mr. So-and-so's desk. He said, "There should be limits to joking, can you falsely report someone's death?" Mr. So-and-so said, "Mr. Chu did die yesterday. Don't you know, sir?" Mr. Qian said, "Strange, strange. There is evidence of this. I just saw Mr. Chu sitting at the desk working, and there was a child standing next to the desk. If you don't believe me, you can go and see." So Mr. So-and-so and Mr. Qian went to the counselor's office together, but there was nothing there. When they asked the people sitting near Mr. Chu, they hadn't seen Mr. Chu sitting there working either. Mr. Qian was very surprised. At that time, there was also a colleague in the ministry, Mr. Zhang, who personally saw Mr. Chu arriving at the ministry. Mr. Chu's car was behind, and his car was in front. Mr. Chu's car passed his car, and they all entered the gate of the Ministry of Justice together, but unfortunately he didn't greet him. So, although Mr. Chu died, it can prove that his soul had not yet disappeared.

Mr. So-and-so also said that in 1927, a sword immortal named Wang came to Beijing. It is said that this sword immortal was sent by the military governor's office of Gansu. Zhang Guangjian, the military governor of Gansu, saw a white light emitted from the mountain and sent people to search for the location of the white light, and then discovered Wang the Sword Immortal. He invited him to the governor's office and tested him several times, and his skills were indeed considerable. Later, he learned that this Wang the Sword Immortal was a classmate of Mr. Luo, a vice minister of a certain ministry, so he sent him to Beijing to live in Mr. Luo's house. Mr. Luo never knew that he had any abilities, nor had he ever tested him once. Suddenly, a person with an extraordinary aura came and saw from afar that a strange white light was emitted from where Mr. Luo was staying. He said that he had said to Mr. Ding'an in the past, "There must be an extraordinary person under the azure mist." There must be an extraordinary person in Mr. Luo's residence, otherwise, where would this white light come from? So he personally visited Wang the Sword Immortal and decided at first sight that he was no ordinary person. From then on, it spread to the ears of the minister (the minister is the department head) of a certain ministry.

This minister was a curious person. In the fourth month of that year, he hastily set up a grand banquet and invited Wang the Sword Immortal to sit in the seat of honor, and invited several vice ministers to accompany him. During the banquet, everyone urged Wang the Sword Immortal to show off his swordsmanship and show his skills. Wang the Sword Immortal was not modest at all, but said that although he knew a little about swordsmanship, his skills were too shallow and he didn't dare to try it rashly. If something dangerous happened, it would be a disservice to everyone's sincerity. So everyone repeatedly asked him to try. Wang the Sword Immortal said, "The matter of trying the sword can wait for another day. I have lived in the mountains for a long time and am used to running. Today, after the meal, I will compete with you once, with the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills as the goal. You can take cars first, and I will follow on foot. Whoever arrives at the temple first wins." Everyone agreed. After the meal, the vice ministers all took their cars and drove quickly towards Biyun Temple.

Who knew that after the meal, Wang the Sword Immortal slowly returned to his residence, closed the door, and paced back and forth in the room. There were many male and female servants outside the residence, whispering and peeking into Wang the Sword Immortal's room, watching which road he would take and how he would walk. Unexpectedly, they never saw Wang the Sword Immortal walk out of the room. They only heard him pacing back and forth for about twenty minutes, and then there was no sound. They guessed that he must have fallen asleep in the afternoon.

Here, the ministers and vice ministers of each ministry, sitting in cars, quickly drove to Biyun Temple. When they arrived at the temple gate, Wang the Sword Immortal was walking slowly with the abbot of Biyun Temple, welcoming them out. Wang the Sword Immortal said with a smile, "I've been here for quite a while. Why are your cars so slow?" Everyone got out of the car, marveling at the sight. Later, when Vice Minister Luo returned home, he asked the servants in detail how Wang the Sword Immortal had walked. The servants recounted the situation at the time and said that they had not seen him walk out. So they concluded that Wang the Sword Immortal was either flying or using earth magic to escape.

These two stories both happened in the Republic of China era. Mr. Chu's soul did not disappear, and Wang the Sword Immortal's flight disappeared without a trace. People in Beijing at the time probably knew the general outlines, which shows that there are many strange things in the world. Mr. Chu was my colleague, and we had been together for more than seven years. His death was not strange, but it was unheard of for him to take a car to the ministry after his death. Wang the Sword Immortal's given name was "Hui." I don't know where he was from. After this competition, he knew that his fame was too great and he could no longer live there, so he hurriedly left Beijing and returned to the mountains of Gansu. Since then, I don't know where he is hiding, and there is no way to investigate. One is "flying has escaped the mortal path," and the other is "death is still ascending the puppet stage." The ancients said, "Half yin and half yang is 'human,' pure yang is 'immortal,' pure yin is 'ghost.'" People ascend to become immortals and descend to become ghosts. If we have good intentions, we ascend and can become immortals. If we have bad intentions, we descend and become ghosts. The distinction between good and evil is the distinction between yin and yang, which is also the distinction between immortals and ghosts. People cannot escape the two realms of yin and yang. I am afraid that Pu Songling did not know this truth either.

### Spring Dream

— Zhang Yiqu

The market opens every seven days,
And dreams of my hometown return:
The forest mist seems to drip like dew,
The river water fragrant, not just the mountains.
Green algae, rice paddies, flower and willow paths,
Green vine thatch huts, bamboo fences, bays.
The scenery is of course good in my hometown,
But I cannot return to home or country.

### Reading

— Qian Yajie

I remember the ancient temple east of the stream bridge,
The setting sun red in the shadows of green willows.
Several sounds of fisherman's flutes beyond the gray smoke,
A few woodcutter's songs in the evening mist.
Lofty ambitions gradually go with the flowing water,
Noble sentiments have followed the morning clouds into the sky.
A lifetime of infinite desolate feelings,
Lost at the end of the world with a broken swan.
