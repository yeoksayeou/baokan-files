### The National Assembly Decides to Follow the Morning Session Format to Conduct the Third Round of Voting for Vice President; Sun Ke and Cheng Qian Express Their Willingness to be Elected

[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] The National Assembly, which adjourned for three days, is scheduled to reconvene at 9:00 AM on the 28th to conduct the third round of voting for Vice President. At 4:00 PM on the 27th, the Chairman convened a meeting which, after two and a half hours of discussion, finalized this agenda. The Chairman and Presidium also held close discussions on how to maintain order in the venue on the morning of the 28th to ensure the smooth progress of the assembly. It was generally agreed that inflammatory publicity materials should not be distributed within the venue, and the Presidium hoped that those involved with the various campaign teams would urge their respective teams to pay attention to this. It is expected that Hu Shi will be appointed as chairman for the assembly on the morning of the 28th. Regarding the declarations by the three vice-presidential candidates to renounce their candidacy, the Presidium representatives Yu Bin, Hu Shi, Chen Qitian, Zeng Baosun, and Sun Yaofu persuaded them, and all three have indicated that they will no longer insist on renouncing. The Presidium originally had no authority to accept the renunciation of candidacy, but since the three are no longer insisting on this matter, it is deemed unnecessary to bring it up for discussion at the assembly. However, the reasons for the two-day adjournment and the process should be explained to the assembly. It was decided that Yu Wu will report to the assembly on the morning of the 28th, after which the third round of voting will proceed. As for the voting and poll monitoring supervisors for the election, 118 individuals were previously selected and will be asked to continue in their roles on the 28th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] The National Assembly Presidium has decided that the third round of voting for Vice President will be held on the morning of the 28th. However, a group of representatives has drafted a temporary motion requesting the Presidium to implement effective measures to prevent manipulation, control, and coercion of the election within the venue. This will be presented at the assembly on the morning of the 28th. The temporary motion also requests Chairman Chiang to attend the assembly and report to the assembly that this vice-presidential election is a free competition, and that party members have absolute freedom in voting. It is anticipated that there will be heated debates before the election voting at the assembly on the morning of the 28th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] After the deadlock in the vice-presidential election was broken, the campaign activities of the various campaign teams reached a fever pitch on the 26th and 27th. Li, Sun, and Cheng each delivered speeches to their respective campaign teams on the evening of the 27th, explaining their own motives and reasons for renouncing or continuing their campaigns, and encouraging their campaign teams to continue their efforts. Li Zongren's campaign team held a meeting at the Anle Ying at 8:00 PM on the 27th, attended by hundreds of representatives. Li delivered a speech in an excited, cheerful, and firm tone, expressing his gratitude for the enthusiastic support of the representatives, saying that this also motivated him to continue participating in the campaign and increased his courage infinitely. He stated that the Chinese people are suffering, the bandit rebellion is not quelled, and he is determined to strive for democracy and continue fighting. When Sun Ke's campaign committee held a meeting, hundreds of representatives also attended. Sun delivered a speech in a relaxed manner, stating that he is now an "should-be-elected" candidate, not a "campaigning" candidate, responding to battle rather than seeking battle, so he is determined not to engage in forced activities, but only rely on the sacred freedom granted to him by the representatives, based on their conscience. As for the activities of the campaign team, it is a matter for the campaign team itself, and he does not intend to intervene. However, Sun expressed that the rumors that there is now a negotiated solution are unfounded. When hundreds of members of Cheng Qian's campaign team gathered at the Central Hotel, Cheng spoke in a sincere manner, repeatedly explaining his earnest hope that the assembly would be completed smoothly and the vice-president would be elected as soon as possible, so that the assembly could come to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible. Cheng stated that he should be elected without campaigning, and that personal gains and losses are definitely secondary, but he expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the enthusiastic support of the campaign team, so he will continue to run.

### Rumors of an Agreement Reached by the Three Vice-Presidential Candidates; Sun Ke Hopes Representatives Will Not Be Misled

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Sun Ke's wife visited the office of his campaign team at the Longmen Restaurant at 6:00 PM on the 27th and addressed the National Assembly representatives present, with three main points: (1) He personally made some efforts in the past for the vice-presidential campaign, but after the changes in the past day or two, the situation is completely different. He had already declared that he would renounce his candidacy, but because the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang and the National Assembly Presidium sent gentlemen to persuade him not to give up, he has now decided to follow the decision of the assembly and continue to run to complete the election process of the Vice President of the National Assembly, but in the future he will not engage in any campaign activities, only "respond to election." (2) There have been many rumors recently, including that the three vice-presidential candidates have reached an agreement and the results have been obtained, and that someone will be elected as vice-president, someone will be the premier, and someone will be the president of the Legislative Yuan. This is absolutely not true. He himself is one of the candidates for the vice-presidency and has never participated in any negotiations with other candidates. Moreover, the vice-president is elected by all the representatives of the assembly, and the premier is nominated by the future president and can only be determined after being approved by the Legislative Yuan. The President of the Legislative Yuan must be elected by all members of the Legislative Yuan. (3) He expressed his gratitude to the representatives for their greatest assistance and support in the past, and hoped that the representatives would freely choose those who can serve the people and contribute to the construction of the country and the suppression of the rebellion, and give them support and support. When casting their sacred and conscientious vote, he hoped that they would not be misled by rumors.

[Another Dispatch] A spokesperson for Cheng Qian's campaign committee released a statement on the 27th, stating: (1) Cheng's renunciation of the election was intended to ensure the smooth completion of the assembly. If the renunciation of the election affects the assembly, it would be contrary to his original intention. Therefore, he voluntarily accepts the decision of the assembly. However, Cheng will only be elected without campaigning, that is, without any activity to win the votes of others. (2) After the principle of free election is determined, the committee hopes that this principle can be firmly maintained, so that every voter can be free from enticement and threats, and not be subject to any other improper interference. (3) Cheng believes that comprehensive reforms must be implemented today in order to save the crisis and complete the suppression of the rebellion, and that the appointment of virtuous and capable people is a prerequisite for implementing reforms. If he is fortunate enough to be elected, he will use his position as an old friend and subordinate of the President to promote its realization. If the election fails, he will also fight as an ordinary citizen for the reform of politics. He has reached the age of retirement, but was ordered by the President to extend his service until June of this year. After the extension expires, he will be able to engage in general political and social movements.

His proposals are: (1) The resignation letters of the vice-presidential candidates should be returned immediately and the election should continue.

### Hu Shi Talks About the Election

Hoping that Candidates and Campaigners Trust the Secret Ballot System

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] A reporter recently asked Dr. Hu Shi for his views on the Vice Presidential election. Hu replied: "Many disputes arise from a lack of full confidence in the anonymous voting system. I had a very good impression of the first two Vice Presidential elections. During the first vote, I even served as a supervisor and had the opportunity to observe closely. I saw that the order was good, and there were no malpractices at all. The entire process was of educational value to the participants. We should have a strong conviction that secret ballots can fully guarantee the fairness of elections, and that any external pressure or bribery or threats will be difficult to take effect. Each voter can use the weapon of the secret ballot to effectively resist or frustrate any improper external pressure. Therefore, I hope that all candidates and their campaigners can fully trust secret ballots. I also hope that everyone will gladly accept the results of future majority votes."

Editorial

### Looking at the National Assembly's Continued Session Today

The National Assembly has adjourned for three consecutive days due to the unexpected controversy surrounding the election of the Vice President. During this adjournment period, although efforts have been made by various parties to lobby and mediate, the resentment in the capital has gradually dissipated; however, the issue of the three candidates withdrawing from the election has not yet been resolved in a clear and thorough manner, and awaits the final decision of the Assembly today. Therefore, the people of the whole country are looking towards Nanjing with anxious and curious hearts, waiting for the National Assembly to continue its session and hold the third round of voting today.

Standing in the position of a third party, we naturally believe that the Vice Presidential election issue is very simple, neither an inscrutable mystery nor an unsolvable problem. We have always believed that the issue of candidates withdrawing from the election can be resolved by following the procedures and methods stipulated in the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law; in other words, the National Assembly can vote for whoever they want at today's meeting, and the voting representatives can ignore whether the candidates withdraw or not. That being said, from another perspective, this election controversy was caused by a misunderstanding between the candidates. If the three candidates cannot achieve thorough understanding and awareness, even if the National Assembly reluctantly reopens and holds a third round of voting to elect the Vice President, the internal cracks will still exist, and will still be enough to cause new political disputes in the future. We cannot ignore this serious crisis. Therefore, whether the resentment in the capital can be transformed into peace and harmony is a major key for today's National Assembly. Therefore, we have no choice but to make an urgent appeal to the three Vice Presidential candidates and all the representatives of the National Assembly.

First, we hope that all three candidates can automatically withdraw their statements of withdrawal, or at least accept the decision of the National Assembly today without any emotion. Leaving aside the legal interpretation, in terms of facts, withdrawing from the election halfway is not the demeanor of a great politician. Because these three candidates had already been vigorously engaging in election activities before the opening of the National Assembly; after the opening of the National Assembly, they were running around day and night, exerting their ability to contact and win over representatives; and the voting has already been held twice. No matter how sufficient their reasons are, they will not be able to convince the people.

Second, we hope that all the representatives of the National Assembly can vote freely with their own conscience. This Vice Presidential election adopts secret ballot. When the representatives sign their names and vote, no one is watching or obstructing them, so they can vote completely freely. Therefore, we ask the representatives of the National Assembly to eliminate all selfishness and prejudice before the third round of voting, and consider again and again with their own conscience who they should vote for, so as not to fail the entrustment of the people.

In short, the reopening of the National Assembly today is an important key. The people of the whole country are watching closely, observing the representatives of the National Assembly voting freely according to law today. Representatives, do not disappoint the people again today.

### After the Establishment of the Rediscount Committee

The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee was officially established yesterday. The authorities believe that after the reorganization of the committee, its nature has changed, and it can achieve the bank's goal of becoming a "bank of banks," and therefore place great expectations on it. However, the outside world believes that the task it bears is too narrow, and its constituent members are mostly biased towards the official side, fearing that it may not be of much benefit to the industrial and commercial sectors. It is hoped that it will broaden its scope and provide as much assistance as possible to private production enterprises, which is naturally what the general public likes to hear.

But fundamentally speaking, it is only a technical institution in the current financial policy. It does not have fixed powers of its own, and its powers are subject to the financial policy. This can be clearly illustrated by the past situations of its predecessor. Therefore, simply hoping that its scope will be expanded is not as practical as directly hoping that the country's financial policy will be quickly relaxed.

The financial policy mentioned here is actually the loan policy. The current loan policy is significantly different from the past in the following three points: (1) Emphasis on national policy loans. These loans can be applied for directly from the Big Four banks, and after approval, they are handled by national banks and bureaus. (2) Business loans can only be applied for from banks and are, in principle, based on a portion of the banks' own deposit funds. (3) In the first case, national policy loans are still allowed to receive low-interest rates, while business loans must be adjusted according to the market. Leaving aside the interest rate issue for the moment, how much capital do general banks and stores have available for merchants to turn around? If the banks and stores are unable to make these loans, how can they apply for rediscount from the Central Bank? If they apply for mortgages or rediscounts from the Central Bank, will the bank use the reason of tightening credit as a shield?

Banks and stores are originally institutions that regulate finance and support industry and commerce. When funds are lacking and insufficient for operation, national banks have an original obligation to provide assistance at any time. Otherwise, how can they become a "bank of banks"? However, when tightening credit becomes the supreme magic weapon for offsetting inflation, all deposits, loans, and remittances are subject to strict inspection and restriction. In certain periods and certain regions, they are openly prohibited, and commercial and industrial sectors are absolutely not allowed to make loans. We really have no reason to believe that commercial banks and stores will be happy to make these business loans, nor is there reason to believe that these business loans can be smoothly re-mortgaged or rediscounted.

We say these few words not because we mean that the financial authorities do not know the above situation. Moreover, they probably know the weakness of the strength of commercial banks and stores today, and the difficulties in the turnover of the industrial and commercial sectors, more deeply than the general public. The reason why they blindly tighten and are unwilling to actively support them is nothing more than that inflation is too high, and floating capital is too abundant. They plan to control the banks and stores more strictly, in order to stem the tide and prevent prices from soaring. Their intentions are certainly very bitter, but they do not know that when floods are rampant and flow thousands of miles, it is by no means possible to stop them by building a short dam, which only makes it impossible for the industrial and commercial sectors to obtain funds and wait for their death; moreover, due to the difficulty of remittances, the finished products of the cities and the raw materials of the interior cannot be exchanged.

The situation in the economic world is deteriorating day by day, and there is a great danger of being unable to make ends meet. We hope that the financial authorities will learn from the past and repent, and re-examine the entire financial policy. As for how to broaden the scope of the Rediscount Committee, it is still a trivial matter. Central Bank President Zhang announced yesterday that the bank will adopt a new rediscount policy to improve the current finance. We hope that this new rediscount policy will not be just passively, but should think for the country, and at the same time think for the merchants and people. The bank's profit and loss account must be paid attention to, but the entire national economy cannot be ignored.

### Zhang Zhen, the General from Southern Henan, Visited the Communist Bandits Called Him "Little Cannon"

[Our Newspaper Xinyang 22nd Air Dispatch] A short, sturdy figure, a kindly face, the demeanor of a Confucian general, this is the outline of General Zhang Zhen, who galloped across the Central Plains and established extraordinary achievements. He is from Luoshan, Henan. He used to fight guerrilla warfare in Henan, and today he is suppressing bandits in Henan again. He is truly a model soldier who "protects his hometown and defends his country." The elders of Southern Henan call him "Nanny," and the Communist bandits call him "Little Cannon." His greatness of spirit can be imagined from this. This reporter rushed to Zhumadian and, after a brief greeting with Deputy Commander Zhao, the guard led me to see General Zhang. Stepping into his humble but clean bedroom and reception room, I immediately felt that the life of this old general in his fifties was so simple and solemn that it was awe-inspiring. General Zhang smiled and handed me a cigarette, and at the same time, he lit his own cigarette. After taking a few puffs, he began to talk endlessly.

On the 19th of last month, the general was ordered to advance eastward to Huangchuan and northward to Xincai. At that time, Liu's First, Second, Tenth, and Eleventh Columns had already gathered in the area, waiting for the arrival of the general's troops, Liu's bandits妄想eliminated their main force. However, the general was prescient and launched an offensive one step ahead of the bandits. Liu's bandits were caught off guard and suffered a surprise attack, collapsing into disarray and retreating one after another. After suffering this blow, the bandits implemented a cunning plan, setting up a "pocket" formation, with the Third and Sixth Columns, Wei Fenglou's independent brigade, and a part of the Tenth Column, crossing the Wo River and feigning an attack on Fuyang, actually企岡诱 General Zhang's部 towards the front, fall into their pocket网, make their to be be all wiped out, the general saw through the鬼计, then avoiding the正面, attacking its側翼, the bandits hard費心機. Riding a虎難下, they猛攻Fuyang, and企岡 to break through the张部main force of the heart still未死, However, in fact has become an absolutely不可能的事.

At the time of the crisis in the Fuyang War, the general led his troops to aid, attacking the side and back of the bandit army. After two days of struggling, Liu's bandits企图 全陷绝望, began to withdraw on the morning of the 3rd. The general immediately tracked and pursued, from Linquan, Shenqiu, Xiangcheng, Runan, all the way to Zhumadian. Such a seven-day fatigue pursuit, in addition to combat, still marched 80 to 100 li per day. The general's troops became more and more courageous in battle, while the bandit army became more and more afraid of fighting, until they窜入驻马店. The bandit army was exhausted of ammunition and food, and exhausted. According to the local people, they all filled their stomachs with bran flour and mixed grains. The bandit regiment commander gathered the soldiers and gave a speech, asking his subordinates if they were willing to attack Queshan. The soldiers remained silent and no one answered. From this, it can be seen that the bandit's momentum has actually been丧气寒心.

### Communist Bandit Economic Conspiracy Three Types of Activities; Economic Investigation Department Decides to Launch a Sweep

Zhao Yulin, director of the Shanghai Office of the Special Economic Investigation Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, told reporters yesterday about the progress of his work and analyzed the three main ways in which communist bandits are currently carrying out economic conspiracies in Shanghai: (1) Using companies and firms as cover, nominally engaged in commercial operations, but in reality, specializing in smuggling materials to aid the bandits. The smuggled materials are mainly sanitary medical equipment, cotton yarn, and grain, which are most urgently needed by the communist bandits. (2) Using coastal sailing vessels to engage in barter trade to obtain urgently needed materials. The illegal trading activities are mostly carried out secretly outside the Wusong Estuary. (3) Every time there is economic market unrest in Shanghai, they push the boat to add fuel to the fire, expanding the disturbance activities. He said: The Special Economic Investigation Department will focus on launching an economic sweep against the communist bandits in its jurisdiction in the future.

### Summer Time Begins on May 1st

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Government received an order from the Executive Yuan, stating: This year's summer time will be from 0:00 on May 1st to 24:00 on September 30th.

### Rejection of Mandatory Regulations for Coal Transport Vessels to Qinhuangdao

The Fuel Management Committee, in order to expedite the transport of coal stockpiled in Qinhuangdao, previously notified the Shanghai Shipping Association with an emergency measure, requiring that all vessels with a tonnage of 3,500 tons or more dispatch a ship to Qinhuangdao at least once a month to load stockpiled coal, or face cancellation of their coal allocation rights. After receiving this notice, the Shipping Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon. All members present decided to reject this mandatory regulation from the Fuel Management Committee. In fact, of the 180,000 tons of coal stockpiled in Qinhuangdao this month, 120,000 tons have already been shipped to Shanghai, accounting for three-quarters of the total, demonstrating the large volume of transport. Technically speaking, there are distinctions between riverboats, seagoing vessels, passenger ships, and freighters. A 3,500-ton riverboat is technically incapable of navigating the Bohai Sea route, otherwise accidents are likely. Furthermore, the transport price for coal is vastly different from general freight rates. In order to maintain minimal profitability, an adjustment to the transport price will be requested from the Fuel Management Committee. It was decided to send a letter to the Fuel Management Committee, responding that the emergency measures are difficult to implement. However, the utmost effort will be made to transport coal from Qinhuangdao, and a higher transport price is requested in order to maintain operational costs.

### District Attorney's Office Indicts Eight Defendants in Air Freight Overcharge Case, Wu Jing'an and Wang Zhu's Evidence of Criminality Insufficient

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Beijing office of China National Aviation Corporation was reported for allegedly raising freight rates without authorization, a case suspected of fraud. After investigation by District Attorney Ding Chuan'en, the defendants—Dao Anping, Acting Head of the Business Section of China National Aviation Corporation, Jiang Nengxiang, Head of the Freight Section, Xu Xin, Head of the Beijing Office, Yan Duzhou, Former Head of the Beijing Office of China National Aviation Corporation, Deng Haozhang, Head of the Operations Section, and Zhou Peiran, Wang Zuoliang, and Qi Nianzu, who are at large—are indicted under the Anti-Corruption Statute for taking advantage of the difficulty of transportation between Peiping and other areas, colluding to monopolize air freight, exploiting merchants, and raising freight rates without authorization, from which they profited. As for the defendants Wu Jing'an, Manager of Jing'an Enterprise Company, and Wang Zhu, Chief Secretary of China National Aviation Corporation, since their involvement was only due to improper administrative measures and the evidence of criminality is insufficient, they will not be prosecuted.

The facts of the crimes in the indictment are extracted below. The indictment states that since around July of last year, when Taiyuan was disturbed by bandit troops and land and water transportation were cut off, all import and export goods relied on air transport for maintenance. The China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation and their Beijing office staff colluded with merchants, creating fictitious businesses, and successively monopolized the Peiping transportation business, while formal transport merchants were refused freight transport when they contacted the airlines, resulting in a large amount of corruption and widespread public criticism. The facts of the crimes are described as follows: (1) Regarding the Hua Mao Company's contracting of the China National Aviation Corporation's freight transport portion, Zhou Peiran, the former head of the China National Aviation Corporation's Kweisui office, used the name of the China National Aviation Corporation on July 7 of last year to raise prices. Dao Anping, the head of the business section of the China National Aviation Corporation, and Jiang Nengxiang, the head of the freight section, contracted the Peiping air freight. Liu Anping, in the name of the business section, wired Xu Xin, the head of the Beijing office of the company, to handle the matter illegally, allowing Zhou Peiran to pay a freight rate of 21,200 yuan per kilogram. Because Zhou Peiran was not familiar with the business community and could not attract freight transport, he entrusted Zhang Zhongzhi, who was familiar with the business situation, to contract for a commission of 2,000 yuan per catty. In total, he collected 18 tons of merchant goods, charging an average of 44,000 yuan per kilogram, for a total freight revenue of 752 million yuan. After paying 281.6 million yuan to the China National Aviation Corporation, Zhou Peiran netted more than 400 million yuan, and the illegal profits were shared among Liu Anping, Jiang Nengxiang, Xu Xin, and others. (2) Regarding the Heji Company's contracting of the China National Aviation Corporation's freight transport portion, Wang Zuoliang, the owner of the Heji Cloth Store in Beijing, took the opportunity to collude with the head of the Beijing office of the China National Aviation Corporation on July 11 of last year, creating a fictitious Heji Company and contracting Peiping air freight, transporting more than 50 tons of merchant goods. Wang Zuoliang paid the China National Aviation Corporation a freight fee of 11,200 yuan, but charged customers as much as 50,000 yuan or 55,000 yuan per short kilogram. In total, he collected 2,734,337,500 yuan, of which only 1,134,530,000 yuan was paid to the China National Aviation Corporation. The profits illegally obtained with Xu Xin amounted to 1,599,835,500 yuan, and Wang Zuoliang forged accounts to cover up the crime. (3) Regarding the Dabe Company's monopoly of the China National Aviation Corporation's freight transport portion, Qi Nianzu, a businessman in Shanghai, agreed with Deng Haozhang, the head of the business section of the Central Air Transport Corporation, and Yan Duzhou, the head of the Beijing office, to allow him to nominally contract the air transport from Peiping to Taiyuan in Beijing. He successively transported 21 tons and 186 kilograms of goods from merchants in Peiping. Except for 6 tons and 82 catties transported by air freight, the Central Air Transport Corporation transported 15 tons and another 140 kilograms. Qi Nianzu charged merchants 21,200 yuan per kilogram for freight, paid the Central Air Transport Corporation, and illegally collected more than 200 million yuan in freight, which was divided between Deng Haozhang and Yan Duzhou.

### Newly Built Municipal Buildings on Changning Road Catch Fire, Spreading to Adjacent Shantytowns, Five Men and Women Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] Three municipal buildings at Nos. 1365 to 1367 on Changning Road in western Shanghai, which had recently been completed and divided into apartments for rent, were preparing to open for business. Unexpectedly, at around 1:20 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out suddenly at No. 1365, instantly piercing through the roof and spreading rapidly, and extending to Nos. 2366 and 1367 next door, as well as a large number of shantytowns in the back alley, over seventy in total. The fire was raging and unstoppable. After receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade immediately dispatched several hose wagons to extinguish the fire. Before long, the Fahua, Huashan, Central, and Yichang sub-brigades, as well as the Caojiadu and Zhenru private fire brigades, arrived to assist in the rescue. However, due to the lack of fire hydrants nearby and the difficulty of obtaining water, the fire was not extinguished until after more than an hour of rescue efforts. While the fire was raging, five residents, two men and three women, were injured when jumping from the building. Those seriously injured included Zhou Linmei (female, 26 years old), with a fractured spine, and Tao Guangjin (female), with a concussion and loss of consciousness. Zhu Wenqi (male, 28 years old) suffered broken hands and feet and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital. There were also minor injuries, including Wang Quanying (female, 17 years old) and Hu Yongxiang (male, 15 years old), who suffered abrasions to the head and hands and were sent to the Tongren Second Hospital for treatment.

### Police Bureau Feels棘手About Vegetable Markets Occupied as Residences

Request Submitted to Municipal Government for Approval of Measures

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has replied to the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding inquiries from councilors at the Fifth General Assembly about the Police Bureau's policy reports. Regarding the question of how to resolve the issue of vegetable markets becoming residences for beggars every night, hindering hygiene, the Police Bureau stated that it has repeatedly ordered each branch bureau to detain and send vagrants and beggars to various relief organizations. From September of last year to the present, a total of 7,758 vagrants and beggars have been detained and sent. However, due to the limited economic resources of various organizations and the limited number of places they can accommodate, and with the increasing number of refugees fleeing from bandit-controlled areas to Shanghai, there are difficulties in accommodating beggars. The Bureau has requested instructions from the Municipal Government on how to handle the matter. Furthermore, regarding the case of "Russian roulette" gambling being rampant in restaurants, the Bureau stated that if gambling with property is involved in "Russian roulette" in restaurants or public places, it is prohibited. However, pure entertainment is not restricted.

### Chen Zizhan Returns to Shanghai After Vegetarian Meal Poisoning, Whether Unclean Cooking Oil Is the Cause Will Be Investigated by Experts

[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 27th] Chen Zizhan, courtesy name Junming, a Shanghai cotton yarn merchant, came to Lingyan Temple in Suzhou on the 25th for a Buddhist ceremony following his mother's death. After more than a hundred relatives and friends ate a vegetarian meal, they suddenly experienced abdominal pain and vomiting, resembling poisoning, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that most of them, due to their mild symptoms, left the mountain and returned to Shanghai that day. Only about twenty people, due to symptoms of dizziness, stayed overnight at the temple. The next day, accompanied by the host, they also returned to Shanghai for recuperation. The Suzhou County Police Bureau, considering the unusual cause of the case, has assigned a special officer to be responsible for thoroughly investigating the truth. According to a doctor, if tung oil is mixed into cooking oil, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea will occur after eating stir-fried dishes, and even loss of consciousness, but recovery can be expected within one or two days. If this is true, the cause of the case should be due to unclean cooking oil. When Chen Zizhan and his party returned to Shanghai, they brought a small amount of leftover cooking oil to Shanghai to be tested by experts in order to investigate liability. Therefore, the truth of the case will soon be revealed.

### Fish Vendor Representatives Petition in Beijing

Demanding the Prohibition of Foreign Employees Publicly Trading

The Shanghai Fish Vendor United Association, due to the long-unresolved case of the Shanghai Sixteen Puxu Fish Trade charging fish vendors 2.5 cents per yuan for foreign employees, and because salted and dried fish products are not openly traded in the fish market but are all transported to Sixteen Pu for sale, believes that this monopolizes the market and manipulates prices, causing great suffering to fish vendors. Therefore, yesterday, they dispatched representatives Rui Chang, Li Songlin, Yu Tang, and Yu Jingqing to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and other departments, requesting the prohibition of foreign employees and requesting that all types of fish products be concentrated in the fish market for open trade in order to facilitate fish vendor purchases.

### Yarn Control Committee Consults with Relevant Organizations on Cotton Yarn and Cloth Supply Issues, Factories' Applications for Cotton Allocation Have Been Continuously Contracted, and Negotiations for Cotton Yarn Transport and Sales to Hong Kong Have Been Successful

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee invited responsible persons from the Central Bank, the Federation of Textile Industries, and the Textile Export Commission for a luncheon meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss issues related to raw cotton supply and cotton yarn and cloth transport and sales.

According to the Yarn Control Committee: the Committee has been expediting the handling of emergency cotton allocation applications from various factories in recent days. As of the 27th, there are 26 applicants for cotton allocation from outside the city, including Danyang Wanxin, and 31 applicants from this city, including Lun Chang and Dafeng, totaling 57. (Among them, six factories, including Zhaofeng, Dafeng, Guoxin, Hosin, Danyang, and Wanxin, have applied for the second time.) 18 factories, including Lun Chang and Chongxin, have already signed contracts, and the remaining factories are in the process of negotiating contracts.

Zhang Sili, director of the export department of the China Textile Construction Corporation, was dispatched to Hong Kong the week before last to contact the person in charge of the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Supply Office on matters related to cotton yarn transport and sales. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday. It is reported that this trip has yielded concrete results. The Textile Construction Corporation has decided to supply 9,270 bales of cotton yarn to Hong Kong in stages, including 20-count yarn and 32-count yarn. It is heard that the first batch will be shipped out soon. The company sold a total of 13,710 bales of cotton yarn to Hong Kong last year.

[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Yarn Control Committee, speaking to reporters: (1) The Committee will soon announce detailed measures regarding the ordering, allocation, and utilization of 700,000 bales of American cotton. (2) Since the commissioning of cotton merchants to purchase domestic cotton, the total number of bales that have been shipped to Shanghai has reached 300,000. There is no fear of a shortage of raw cotton supply. (3) It is rumored that after the lifting of the ban on southern transportation of cotton yarn, it triggered a surge in cotton cloth prices, but in fact, this was artificially created and has nothing to do with the opening of southern transportation. (4) In the past, the monthly quota for southern transportation of cotton cloth was reviewed and announced by the Committee. This time, the quota limit has been lifted, and there are no restrictions on the export of cotton cloth to the south.

### Affected by Rising Prices in Producing Areas, the Rice Market Is Rising Briskly, with Top-Grade Japonica Rice in the Northern Market Reaching 4.25 Million Yuan

The rice market is slowly rising, and yesterday's market showed another increase. Due to the daily increase in prices in Wuxi, holders of goods are strongly raising prices, increasing by about 10,000 or more. However, the outflow is still sluggish, and with a slight increase in arrivals, the market is still expected to slightly decline. In the southern market, white japonica rice rose by 100,000 yuan, early indica rice rose by 50,000 yuan, and white yuan rice, due to scarce arrivals and brisk sales, rose by 200,000 yuan, opening high at 4.5 million yuan.

Lao Che Flour fell by 10,000 yuan, and Hongfeng Jiancheng flour saw little change. Bran was strong early but weak later, and wheat factory prices remained unchanged at 2 million yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Prices fluctuated. The factory side had few customers for yellow soybeans, and the market declined due to sluggish sales. Early-crop soybeans fell by 50,000 yuan. Early-crop beans were in short supply, and supply and demand were equal, so the market was firm. Corn stocks were low, and Qingdao's quotations rose again. With continuous absorption by customers, the price rose by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 50,000 to 70,000 yuan. Tea beans saw little change. Sesame from Tianjin was being purchased again, rising by more than 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were expensive and sluggish, while secondary grades were brisk, with fluctuations of more than 100,000 yuan.

Cooking Oil

Prices rose, especially for raw oil, as customers from Qingdao patronized the market. Qingdao Jitung raw oil closed at 10.1 million yuan, and was even quoted higher at 10.2 million yuan, rising by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. The factory side had a large supply of soybean oil, with a price of 8.75 million yuan, and then the price of retrieved goods opened at 8.78 million yuan, up 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil rose slightly by 50,000 yuan, and Tianjin buyers purchased small-batch sesame oil, rising by 350,000 yuan. Soybean cake had no sales, transactions were scarce, and the price fell by 20,000 yuan.

### Hua Stock's New Purchases Fail to Continue, Market Trend Meanders and Declines

Hua stocks continued to struggle to gain a firm footing yesterday. Wing On Textile reached a new peak of 2150 yuan at the opening bell, but the majority opted to cash out, and soon the trend turned unfavorable with extremely thin trading volume. Most stocks suffered losses.

In the early morning, sentiment remained positive. Wing On Textile opened high at 2150 yuan. While No. 232 was absorbing shares, the exchange rate did not improve and there was no new stimulus, so the price quickly retreated slightly. Nos. 56 and others sold off, driving the price down to 2090 yuan. With loose credit and foreign stocks showing strength, there were several rebounds to around 2155 yuan. However, new purchases failed to keep up.

### Macao Gold Transported to Guangzhou Reaches 2,000 Taels Daily

[Guangzhou News] Smuggling gold from Macau into Guangzhou, where a profit of over one million yuan can be made per tael, is considered a shortcut to wealth by private smugglers. The lure of profit draws everyone like moths to a flame. According to reliable statistics, a major gold firm in this city purchases over 1,000 taels of gold from Macau daily. The remaining gold firms purchase an average of over 1,000 taels as well. This batch of gold is then transported to Shaoguan, Changsha, Hankou, and other places. This issue has drawn the attention of financial regulatory agencies, as the floating of gold on the market affects the financial stability and fuels smuggling. Yesterday, military police were notified to strictly investigate gold smuggling by land and sea. (Industry and Commerce Agency)

### Discount Committee Established Cultivating Good Commercial Paper to Guide Social Funds into Production

[Our Report] The Central Bank's Discount Committee held its inaugural meeting yesterday (the 27th) at 5 PM. Governor Chang presided over the meeting. Governor Chang delivered a speech, stating, "...Recently, due to the needs of suppressing the rebellion, budget revenues and expenditures cannot match, leading to inflation. There have been criticisms from both domestic and foreign sources that bank loans are flowing into the hands of those who hoard goods, advocating that the government should tighten credit. To ensure the supply of legitimate production funds and the efficient use of financial resources, the government, in order to balance both aspects, has changed the loan review methods of the Four Banks Joint Office. It was also decided that the Central Bank should establish a Discount Committee to review applications for discounts from various banks. From now on, the Central Bank will not directly provide loans, but will specialize in rediscounting and remortgaging for various banks. National banks and commercial banks will be treated equally. The loan targets are sound production enterprises that meet the current needs of the country, thereby achieving sound management of various banks and cultivating good commercial paper to guide social funds into production." Subsequently, discussions were held on the detailed rules for the Discount Committee and the draft rules for interbank discounts. It was decided that the members would study these in detail and discuss them at the next meeting. The members exchanged opinions on the scope and principles for reviewing various types of loans, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 8 PM. It is reported that the next meeting is scheduled for next Monday (May 3rd).

### Tennis Umpire and Linesman Appointed for the National Games

The tennis umpires and linesmen for the National Games have all been appointed, totaling forty-seven. The chief umpire is Zhao Minheng, and the secretaries are Yu Zhizhong and Hou Danian. There are about thirty participating units in this tennis competition, and the total number of matches will exceed one hundred and fifty, making it one of the most demanding programs of the Games. The number of umpires and linesmen required is considerable, and the current staff is still afraid of not being enough to allocate. With many matches and long hours, coupled with everyone's career commitments, it is difficult to serve full-time. Therefore, in reality, it is necessary to divide into morning and afternoon shifts. Among them, a small number of umpires and linesmen are recommended from various parties, some of whom have never set foot in a tennis court and do not understand the rules of tennis games. With these people appointed by the conference, it is inevitable that the allocation of work will be affected.

### Neighbor

— Hongjia

——A Record of Mr. Wang Zhuoyou

Only after becoming a neighbor with Mr. Wang Zhuoyou did my impression of him change.

He is a celebrity, teaching at two universities. His courses in ethics and sociology are the most popular among students. Needless to say, when a person becomes famous, he naturally becomes busy: on the street, we would often encounter a dilapidated rickshaw, carrying the rather prosperous-looking Mr. Wang Zhuoyou, being wearily pulled around by that emaciated rickshaw puller.

Once, a friend A hosted a dinner, and I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Wang Zhuoyou. Among the seven or eight guests at the table, he was the oldest, in his fifties, and his social status was relatively high, so everyone treated him as the center of the conversation. And he, indeed, did not disappoint as a knowledgeable elder, having deep and thorough insights into all kinds of complex social, political, and economic issues. Listening to his well-organized and reasoned speech, everyone would be moved and sincerely respect him.

As the dinner broke up, A specially patted my shoulder and said:

"Old X, you may as well often ask Mr. Wang for advice, you will definitely gain a lot of knowledge."

I nodded. Although it was the first time we met, I did indeed have a very good impression of Mr. Wang Zhuoyou.

I did not go to visit him. Because I felt that his work was very busy, it was not good to disturb him.

However, the opportunities to meet him or hear him speak in other places slowly increased, and we became acquaintances. When he sat in that rickshaw and walked down the street, as soon as he saw me, he would clasp his hands in front of him and bow to me. This kind of polite etiquette, although it inevitably made me feel constrained, did not affect my respectful attitude towards him.

After repeated contact, I learned that he was a Kropotkinist. He studied Kropotkin's theory very deeply. When he expounded the theory of mutual aid, explaining human love in a melodious tone, even those who were addicted to sensual pleasures would be moved.

I was very honored to have the opportunity to become his neighbor.

Originally, I was borrowing a room at a colleague's house. But this colleague's mother-in-law brought her recently graduated third daughter from the countryside to the city to take the school entrance exams. In this way, I had to move out of the room I was borrowing.

I was feeling anxious about this when A ran over to tell me that Mr. Wang Zhuoyou had recently had a room vacated by a tenant, and if I was willing to fill the space, it probably wouldn't be a problem.

The room was about ten feet square, and the lighting and location were not bad. What made me hesitate was that the rent was a bit expensive, five dou of rice a month. As a result of A's mediation, the deposit of two dan of rice was waived, and the rent was calculated at 80% of the market price of rice. For this, Mr. Wang Zhuoyou also expressed his deepest apologies to me, saying:

"This room was originally vacant, and it should have been given to you, brother. But, to be honest, it is not easy to find a house here. Even this dilapidated house, I don't know how many relatives and friends have come to me to negotiate. Now that I rent it to you, they still resent me! As for the rent, I charge five dou of rice per room here. Now I am giving you a little discount, which is a little gesture of mine. But," he suddenly emphasized his tone, "you must not let the other tenants know, otherwise, it will increase my troubles."

As he said this, he suddenly burst out laughing. After laughing for a while, he said with emotion:

"Life is not easy, ah, this old ox of mine is bearing a heavy load. Three children, one in university, two in high school. If it weren't for a little subsidy from the rent, I simply wouldn't be able to carry on. But, the rent can't be raised, what is five dou of rice worth at this moment?"

After becoming Mr. Wang Zhuoyou's tenant, the opportunity to get close to him did not increase. He was rarely at home during the day, and he did not easily come downstairs after returning home. Sometimes, when we met in the courtyard, he would as usual clasp his hands in front of him and bow, and often he would rush past before I could return the greeting.

There were a total of eight people in his family. All three sons boarded at school. Besides Mr. Wang Zhuoyou himself and his rickshaw puller, there was also his wife with the eel-like feet, a deaf old woman who was in charge of cooking, and an underdeveloped maid with a foolish-looking face. These three women were like ghosts, rarely hearing them speak all day long. However, as soon as Mr. Wang Zhuoyou returned home, the upstairs would start bustling. He often loudly scolded something, as if nothing was to his liking.

"Damn it! I..." That voice was no longer as beautiful and pleasant as when he was talking about mutual aid and human love, but became rough and cruel.

At first, this made me feel very strange and troubled, repeatedly asking myself: "Could that really be Mr. Wang Zhuoyou?" But slowly, I became used to it.

Once, after the second watch of the night, I was about to go to sleep when suddenly, there was a clanging sound, as if a cup had been smashed upstairs. —A moment of silence, followed by a storm:

"Damn it! You've lost your soul! A good foreign porcelain cup, you insist on breaking it! Huh, see if I dare to beat the skin off you!" Mr. Wang Zhuoyou's throat roared like a bamboo tube being split open.

"Ah!" a girl's panicked scream, followed by two crisp slaps.

"Heh heh heh..." The girl started to cry.

"You're still crying! I'm glad you're crying!" That voice was even more furious.

"Wah" a sound, followed by a few heavy "thump thump" sounds on the back, and a rush of chaotic footsteps, mixed with crying, ran out of the room. Only Mr. Wang Zhuoyou's loud throat vibrated in the silent night:

"See if I'll starve you tomorrow!"

What followed was a series of foul curses. I didn't want to listen anymore, and hurriedly covered my head with the quilt.

Four months later, due to the wise authorities' effective control, the price of rice suddenly became an untethered wild horse, rising ten times more than when I moved into Mr. Wang Zhuoyou's house. I really couldn't afford the rent of five dou of rice. Helplessly, I had to shamelessly ask him to reduce the rent. "This, this..." He frowned at me for the first time, and after hesitating for a moment, he said:

"This shouldn't be a problem, but I really can't carry on lately. Moreover, reducing your rent is a small matter, but how can I deal with the other tenants?"

The problem was not resolved, and he promised to consider it again.

Ten days later, his eel-footed wife suddenly paid a visit to my room. After talking east and west for a while, she finally explained her intention:

"The school is about to have summer vacation. Our children all want to come home, and there's no space in the house. Your husband is not an outsider, we want to take this room..."

I didn't wait for her to finish, and agreed to move out by the end of the month.

On the night before I moved, Mr. Wang Zhuoyou cordially invited me to eat at his house. Perhaps he had drunk too much wine, he seemed extremely excited, and endlessly talked about the old tunes of mutual aid, human love, and so on. Was he moved by his own words? The tears in his eyes sparkled under the electric light, but I didn't listen to a word. I would unconsciously look at the foolish girl who was serving us by our side, she listened blankly to her master's wise words, and occasionally peeked at him with a thief-like, timid gaze.

Now, I still often encounter Mr. Wang Zhuoyou. He is still so prosperous-looking, and that dilapidated rickshaw has also been repainted. But the rickshaw puller is even thinner, and even more exhausted when running. Naturally, he cannot help but clasp his hands in front of him and bow to me, and I, as usual, smile and nod. But in my heart, I really want to spit on him. (Written in Rong in April)

### Zhimo Miscellany

— Xu Zhimo's Posthumous Works, Compiled by Chen Congzhou

"Not envious nor demanding, nothing useless and not good." "Envy" means harm, jealousy. Wenzheng said, "There is no greater good than forgiveness, and no greater evil than jealousy." The jealous act like gossiping women, why bother comparing them. Those with high talent are never willing to bend, and those with arrogant temperament are never willing to submit to others. If they lack the effort of self-cultivation, at best, they will be full of thorns, perverse and complaining. In short, this is not the demeanor of a great man. A gentleman puts the country first and makes nurturing talents his career, selecting superior steeds from the mediocre and identifying jade from tiles. Those who are more virtuous than I, I will learn from them. Those who are more talented than I, I will respect them. One to achieve others, one to achieve oneself, this is the way to enjoy life and know destiny. Envy is the business of petty people, harming one's nature and wounding one's virtue, how can one win people over? Therefore, if one does not love oneself, then so be it. If one has the ambition to rule the world, then one should not envy those who precede him.

The Analects say, "A gentleman who is not serious will not be respected, and learning will not be firm." This does not mean to pretend to be dignified. Therefore, it is said to "be loyal and trustworthy." This is not self-isolation. Scholars should recognize the greatness of the world, and then see their own shortcomings. Knowing shortcomings leads to respect, respect gives rise to awe, awe of Heaven's will, awe of great men, awe of the words of the sage. Those who are in awe deliberate on their actions and naturally reach. The affairs of the world are so numerous that one cannot possibly exhaust even one or two of them. From this perspective, I am not as good as the carpenter. One should be careful internally and value oneself externally, and then know to seek practical and applicable learning.

Gordon said, "The nature of barbarians is without long-term consideration and greedy for profit. This is why their virtue is close to that of beasts." Try to close your eyes and seek within myself, how much does my virtue differ from that of the barbarians? Can one not be vigilant? Can one not be vigilant?

On the 29th, I read Mr. Rengong's "New People's Theory" and "Moral Education Mirror," and ten volumes were filed first. Joy, annoyance, shame, and emotion all came together at once. Just as Baoyu in "The Dream of the Red Chamber" recited the crab poem and said, "Mine should also be burned!" Now, when I read Mr. Rengong's text, I also say, "My disciple's should also be burned!" (Isn't that a bit frivolous!)

To know is to have innate knowledge, to act is to realize knowledge. Straightforward and delightful, I accept it! I embrace it!

### Lady Lu Zao's Painting of Orchids

— Ma Gongyu

Having painted with a single heart, given as a gift,
The shimmering light green does not require weeding.
Because the twin stems constantly condense dew,
Even more delighted by the spiritual root leading the phoenix chicks (The lady's third son, Lin, was able to paint at the age of eight).

Moved from a hidden valley, still dyed with mist,
Purple pedicels and cinnabar buds, each charming.
Why bother using a yellow porcelain dipper to preserve the fragrance,
Ten steps of secluded elegance, like the female Meng Jian.

Xiang stems and Jian stamens claim to be fragrant,
Who recognizes the Ouji branch has an ancient fragrance (Ouji orchids are produced in Yongjia, and the Wen Hengshan poem says, "Cherish the spiritual root from Ouji East");
A hundred scrolls in Jiangnan show their beauty,
The spring breeze adds adornments, meticulously admiring.

### South Peak's Wax Sandals

— Lü Baihua

Spring is already at its tail end. As a busy man, I naturally have no interest in seeking spring. Coincidentally, I need to return to my hometown in eastern Zhejiang, and Hangzhou is inevitably on the way. Allowing the scenery of the lake and mountains to cleanse my troubled mind would be an accidental and rare "fate," as they say.

Initially, I planned a trip to the Twin Peaks. The two peaks that stand facing north and south – along the North Peak area, only the secluded Feilai Peak is worth seeing. The scenery is too monotonous. The three Tianzhu temples are just a group of people worshipping the Yellow Cloth Bag, and feel even more monotonous. Just yellow temples and alluring incense smoke. Therefore, after comparing, I still prefer to go to the South Peak line. From the pillow facing the Qiantang River, the surrounding valleys are indeed worth exploring. This was also an introduction from Chen Zong'en, a friend in Hangzhou who is about to take office as the magistrate of Xuanping County, who took time out to guide me.

We departed from the lakeside, taking a public bus directly to Qinwang Mountain, visiting Gu Dunru, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in Zhijiang. He accompanied us to see the newly equipped architectural teaching materials and lathes, instruments, etc. We sat for a while in his self-titled Liuyun Pavilion, looking out at the flat-flowing river. Thinking of Qin Shihuang, who burned books and buried scholars, when he toured the east and climbed this mountain, Zong'en said to me, "Unexpectedly, thousands of years later, this place has become the highest institution of learning."

Descending Qinwang Mountain, we ran up the steps to the seventh floor of the Liuhe Pagoda. It is said that this is the story of King Qianzhen suppressing the tidal bore, but the monks in the temple stubbornly pointed out that this is a memorial to Su Qin and the Six Kingdoms. Perhaps it is the coincidence of the pagoda's name, coupled with the misinformation from the neighboring Wangshan? Afterwards, we called a car to Hupao.

Walking into Daci Temple through the dense pine forest, we saw a Hupao Spring. Because of the presence of solidified matter in the water, the tea brewed with it never overflows, even when it is full. Behind the tea seat is a steep mountain wall, with a stone tiger and a cave at the bottom, as if telling us that the mountain god has just emerged! This can be considered a supplement to the legend that a monk who once stayed there dreamt of a tiger running and obtaining the spring. In the past, on the dripping cliff, there was a poem carved by Ma Yifu, with the line "Po Lao inadvertently obtained a pinch," and a couplet inscribed by Master Ji Gong beside the Ji Gong Pagoda, which aroused my yearning.

Time was really too short, so we could only take a hurried look. We didn't have time to go to Yanxia Cave. After seeing the Floating Snail of the Sea in the Stone House Ancient Cave, we jumped on the return car. The shell-shaped cave reminded me of Shiyi Ji, which says:

"There is a large snail named Duobu, carrying its shell to travel; when it is cold, it returns to its shell. When a wise king appears in the world, it floats on the seashore."

It must be that the Duobu snail forgot its shell and was embedded here. Or perhaps this area was once part of the sea tail, which was cut off by the mischievous child of creation, turning into thousands of jagged rocks. The large snail floating on the seashore didn't have time to escape and became a palm-blowing disciple of the Tathagata. I deluded myself with this explanation, since there are plenty of myths between the Twin Peaks and the lake anyway. However, the floating snail should symbolize peace, but the current era is filled with the smoke of war.

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

Ruskin's Love Letters

The British literary critic John Ruskin once pursued the beautiful young woman Effie Gray. Admiral Sir William James recently compiled a book, "Ruskin and Effie Gray," which collects many letters. Effie Gray eventually married Ruskin, but after six years of marriage, they divorced. Effie Gray "did not at all think that she had ever been Ruskin's wife."

Effie Gray

Ruskin did not want to marry a woman with whom he had no common interests. Perhaps their divorce was because his wife was a socially ambitious person?

This art critic wrote love letters to Effie when he was twenty-eight years old. The letters contained shy tenderness and the imagined marriage of a prospective son-in-law with a beautiful young woman. It seems that his technique surpassed his true feelings, and he was afraid of Effie's seduction.

He said in one letter: "I don't know how to compare you. You are like a sweet forest with a pleasant clearing. People wander there, go to the center, feel cold and cannot pass through. Effie, you are so hateful, but you don't know it yourself."

Another letter, which has been called "mature love," said: "My own Effie, my benevolent Effie, my mistress, my friend, my queen, my lover, my only love, how good you are, I cannot answer you a single word today. In half an hour, I have to go to town with my mother and there are many things to do, but I must first write a reply to you. I will never be jealous of you. I want to maintain a purer form of jealousy, desiring more love, within certain limits."

However, when he concentrated on his work, he would forget about love. "I am busy with architecture, and sometimes I almost completely forget everything about you." The same was true when he climbed to the top of a chapel or a mountain. "When I paint mountains, I forget myself and my wife."

William has six hundred and thirty-three letters, only one-third of which have been published. In addition to Ruskin and Effie, there are also letters from their parents and from Millais, Effie's husband in 1854.

Dreiser's Posthumous Work

Dreiser

Theodore Dreiser, the great American novelist, wanted to write a "Triology of Desire" during his lifetime. The first part, "The Financier," was published in 1912, and "The Titan" was published in 1914. These two books had a lasting impact on American novels, and many readers were waiting for the completion of the third part. Thirty years later, "The Stoic" was finally published. We can guess why he did not publish this book during his lifetime. He had worked hard on this book, with two or three endings, allowing his copyright-inheriting children to choose; but no matter how he revised it, he could not reach the level of the first two parts.

The first part is the most moving. "The Financier" integrates economics, politics, and love into one. The story itself and the climax are very attractive to readers. Frank Aigernon Couperwood's imprisonment had two reasons: one was public, he used municipal funds to gamble and lost; the other was secret, he seduced the daughter of Efward Malia Butier. Butier was one of the three political giants in Philadelphia, and this person is written most vividly in the trilogy, even more than the protagonist Couperwood.

The second part, "The Titan," alternates between writing about sex and wealth. The wealth part is better than the sex part.

If we check the "American Biographical Dictionary," we can find an entry about Charles Tyson Yerkes (1837-1905), and you can see how closely Dreiser's Couperwood matches Yerkes. Yerkes's life can also be divided into three parts. First, his adventures in Philadelphia, including imprisonment. The second piece of luck was when he sold the streets, and there were rumors outside about his divorce and remarriage. Later, he managed the Chicago street railway, followed by a bribery struggle.

The third part of Yerkes's trilogy was when he sold the street railway and got fifteen million dollars in stolen money. He went to London to try to control London's water pipes. His crimes were even greater than what Dreiser dared to say.

Just as he was about to achieve victory in wealth, he died of a serious illness. After his death, his wealth gradually dissipated. The free hospital he dreamed of was never built, and the art gallery he planned to build for New Yorkers was also auctioned off. The Chicago auction house went bankrupt hopelessly, and London's water pipes, which should have been his main memorial, were occupied by others after success.

Dreiser's third part was not very successful because the author did not know London well. He also could not write all of Yerkes's affairs. His successors will not correct even two or three historical errors in it.

### Celebrating Festivals

— Nian Hong

People often have the habit of "borrowing in small amounts and repaying in full." What is owed bit by bit on ordinary days is repaid all at once during festivals. They are willing to rush around and become exhausted in a few days, but never think of paying attention at any time to avoid digging a well when they are already thirsty. Like garbage and dust in the corners of walls, they are reluctant to spend a little effort to sweep and wipe them every day, until the eve of the Lunar New Year, when they do a major cleaning, spending a whole day mobilizing the entire family, and perhaps still not able to clean everything up. The same is true for studying. If you usually put in effort, you don't need to stay up all night before exams, becoming exhausted, and still not getting good grades. This principle seems very simple, but getting rid of this bad habit is extremely difficult.

Perhaps the wise people of the past took this into consideration, knowing that people's "sporadic effort" mentality is not easy to eliminate, so they had to come up with the method of setting a certain day of a certain month as a certain festival, both to remind everyone not to forget this matter and to take this opportunity to repay what has been accumulated on weekdays. The intention was originally good. For example, to promote filial piety, they try to create a Father's Day and Mother's Day; to value the next generation, they set up a Children's Day and Youth Day, and so on. Gradually, there are more and more commemorative festivals on the calendar, such as 8/8, 9/9, 10/10, etc. All days that are easy to remember have been designated as some kind of memorial day.

As the March 8th Women's Day approaches, women begin to be noticed. Articles about improving women's rights can often be seen in the newspapers, and the several women's issues raised every year are being discussed extensively again. Then, it turns to the issue of youth prospects. As for children, they are even more the masters of the future, and children's welfare must not be neglected, because time has already progressed from March 8th to March 29th and April 4th. After April 4th, it will be the workers' day; and once Labor Day has passed, the labor problem seems to have been solved along with it, and everyone is enthusiastic about promoting the greatness and sublimity of maternal love. In June, there is often Poet's Day, and there is a special poetry issue in the literary supplement. Soon, a series of commemorations of the sacred War of Resistance and the arrival of the great victory begin. After National Day, this kind of intoxication and emotion gradually fades, people realize the passing of a year, and begin to prepare how to spend the annual Christmas and Lunar New Year's Eve. Naturally, the prostitution problem still has to be discussed, and children's health competitions still have to be held—when another Women's Day and Children's Day arrive.

After the sports meet, sports are considered to have been promoted. After the anti-tuberculosis week, it seems that tuberculosis has received a special medicine. After the traffic safety week, it is okay to ignore city tigers hurting people. After May Fourth, even if those who engage in literature starve to death, at most they only earn a sigh!

Important figures are busy all year round attending meetings and giving speeches. Revolutionary martyrs and heroes of the War of Resistance are only remembered at this time. The meaning of "festival" has long been blurred and unrecognizable, but every time there is a commemorative day, the grand occasion is unprecedented. Everyone discusses and studies enthusiastically, but what have they actually gained? Perhaps no one can answer.

### Abolishing Jiao and Fen

— Hong Xian

I saw news in the newspaper that the banking industry has abolished jiao and fen in accounting. But in reality, aren't units like one yuan, ten yuan, and one hundred yuan also nominal? Try asking now to withdraw cash from the bank, and when encountering amounts less than a thousand yuan, how can they be seriously paid out? It would be better to simply omit units below a thousand yuan, which would be more practical.

It will also be more difficult for children to understand the units of currency in the future. They only know that banknotes of a thousand yuan or more are available. What are hundred-yuan and ten-yuan notes have long been forgotten. As for a few jiao and fen, they have become abstract things. This is truly a tragedy.

I remember last year in the countryside of Sichuan, an old lady took her savings of ten years' worth of two-jiao notes to buy meat. When she was refused, she stared blankly, at a loss. The newspaper published this as news. I only wonder whether future generations will look at today as we look at the past?

### Spring Outing

— Tan Ke

Spring is about to pass! Apart from taking off my cotton robe and putting on a jacket, spring has no effect on me. The cement floor has not changed, and the sky is still the same. People living in the city are tired of the sound of car horns and have grown weary of the bustling crowds. They want to escape from their pigeon-coop-like homes and get close to nature. Their noses, blackened by coal smoke, also need to absorb some fresh air. It must be for these reasons that a large number of "Shanghainese" have poured out of "Oriental Paris" for the annual – what a lovely term! – spring outing. However, spring outings are still only for the lucky ones. I did not get this fortune. My planned spring outing, the destination is Hangzhou, the time is a week. The hope is a bit too extravagant, but I believe that "aiming high," may get somewhere, if Hangzhou cannot be visited or the stay is less than a week, the spring outing in principle can always be realized, unexpectedly, spring is about to pass, the spring outing looks like it is stillborn.

Friends in Hangzhou have repeatedly sent letters "urging me to come," first in a tempting way, saying how beautiful the spring in West Lake is, and that it is a pity to miss such a good spring. Later, they scolded me for not understanding the joys of life, saying that I was gloomy and indifferent to spring. Another friend from Guangdong also wrote to ask me if I had "toured" Hangzhou's "spring," asking me to send a few photos and write a report on my Hangzhou trip. He thought that with only a few hours of train travel between me and Hangzhou, going once a week would not be anything, but he did not know that things were not always so. Let me end with a saying from Mencius: Do I love cement floors and the smell of coal smoke? I am forced to.

### Anecdotes of Tolstoy

— Oriental Dawn

One day, an old man walked into the editorial office of a Russian thought magazine. He was wearing a sheepskin coat, a fur hat, and holding a manuscript in his hand. The secretary took the manuscript from his hand; it was a novel written by a farmer named Semenov. The secretary told the old man to go back and come back in two weeks to hear the reply. On time, the old man came again. The secretary told him to wait there. At this time, two editors and a publisher were excitedly chatting and drinking red wine in the study. The secretary came in and announced that someone was waiting outside to hear the reply to the novel by the farmer Semenov. The literary editor of the magazine was a tall young man with beautiful hair, a bifurcated beard, and glasses:

"Yes, yes, I have already read it. Let him wait a while, I will go to see him right away."

However, that kind of excited conversation could not be interrupted, so time passed unknowingly. About an hour and a half later, the secretary appeared again at the door of the study.

"Mitofan Nilovich—that old man is still waiting outside!"

"Yes, yes, I will go to see him right away."

A lot more time passed, and the secretary urged him for the third time, and the editor finally found the manuscript and walked into the reception room.

"Where is that old man?"

The old man in the sheepskin coat stood up from the wooden chair. The editor walked over to him: "Are you the one who sent Semenov's manuscript last time? I have already read this novel..."

The editor raised his eyelids to look at the old man, and suddenly stopped his sentence. It turned out that standing in front of him was the famous Leo Nikolaevich Tolstoy. He had been sitting there quietly, waiting for more than two hours.

### On Precedent

— Yu Longguan

Many things in society are unnecessarily hindered, with no way to develop and progress. "Precedent" can be said to be one of the reasons. I remember that the newspaper reported last time that university students requested full public funding, and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education said: "There is no precedent abroad." This couldn't help but make people have some thoughts. I think it doesn't matter whether there is a precedent or not, and there is no need to take foreign countries as an example. It should be determined purely by the national finances. Just because other people have not stipulated it, we cannot implement it. Isn't this a joke! At the same time, I also feel too pitiful. Others have stipulated that every citizen must receive compulsory education, so why can't we universally implement it? If our country were also wealthy, we could have free admission to all universities, middle schools, and primary schools, so that everyone could have the opportunity to study, and the level of knowledge of the people would be higher than that of all countries in the world. Wouldn't that also be a good thing? Why does our country have to follow behind others in everything, unable to catch up and create a new style? The hearts of the people of our country are bound by the "precedent" trap, no wonder everything is affected.

Furthermore, the implementation of some affairs in institutions must also have a precedent in order to ensure that you do not make mistakes. People with considerable work experience and older people must always investigate cases and find out what the previous examples were. We dare not say that "precedent" has no value at all, but its essence is definitely not a treasure trove. Many past examples are not necessarily suitable for today's use, just like the entire history, it is to make people understand the past changes and their causes, so that they can learn to predict the future and use it as a reference for dealing with today's affairs. Using previous examples as a norm in everything can only at best achieve Xiao Gui Cao Sui, and this is still from a good perspective, it is impossible to surpass and stand out. If the example itself has problems, then the consequences are not difficult to imagine!

Everything has a beginning, a process, and an end. If everyone rigidly adheres to the rules and follows precedents, how can previous examples be created? Therefore, we can only use examples as a reference when encountering things, and cannot regard them as a golden rule, let alone limit our thinking within the scope of examples and restrict progress. We should create new and good examples in order to make progress every day. From major national policies to minor personal matters, it is all the same. We must try our best to break through the circle of "precedent" so that everything can move towards a new path.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

No one can make life consistent with dreams. If they really become one, either life stops or dreams are destroyed.

In order not to look down on yourself yesterday, don't regret your mistakes yesterday.

In order not to let yourself down tomorrow, don't let what has already been wrong go wrong again and again.

### Bai Jiao's Solo Exhibition

— Zhang Yiqu

Fu Weng is good at painting orchids and is also skilled in calligraphy. He is known as the "Three Perfections" with his poetry. Recently, he held a solo exhibition in the Chinese Art Garden. I happened to go to see it and met him. After talking for a while, I felt that the person was like his orchids. His fame in the art world is definitely not accidental. It is difficult to appreciate art in a short time, chatting and walking ten steps to connect with fragrant orchids. His roots are beautiful and his essence is truly pure and flawless, leaving it for the world to look at with admiration.

His poetic talent is as famous as that of Du Fu, the subtlety of his calligraphy is like the Orchid Pavilion. More righteous is the monochrome brush in his studio, a faint fragrance in a spring breeze.

### Poems Inscribed on Walls

— Fu Lu

In post pavilions and small temples, there are often excellent verses inscribed on the walls. These are mostly the works of travelers and women longing for their husbands, whose drifting lives across the world have filled their hearts with depression and sorrow. These are works of genuine emotion, unlike those who merely sing about the wind and moon. I once saw Xue Hong's occasional transcript in two volumes, which was extremely abundant in its collection. The author was probably someone who had spent half his life traveling north and south? Therefore, I have collected a few of those I have seen over the years:

Before the war, I traveled to Houhu in Nanjing and saw a poem inscribed on the wall of the Lake God Temple by someone named Huan Tian and Xu Linggong. It was subtle and lingering, like someone who had failed in the capital and was lonely. Huang Jigang once wrote a poem in the same rhyme. The poem said: Cherry blossoms have fallen, swallows have come, the water pavilion is swept clean of wartime dust, wind and clouds compete for the imperial aura in the northwest, guests and hosts welcome talented people in the southeast; the lake willows and lake mist are not weak water, mountain flowers and mountain birds lean against strong brushes, I have not followed Xu Yuan to the golden pass, but first followed the drifting tumbleweed to write seven laments.

Luotian Rock is in the southern suburbs of Yundu. Zhou Lianxi and Yue Wumu once traveled there, and the scenery is secluded and there is another world. In the early summer of the twenty-eighth year, my friend Liu Qingru happened to be the magistrate of this city and invited me to visit. I saw three ci poems inscribed on the wall by Ma Xinshi. The Bodhisattva Man said: I drink three cups of wine in the quiet night, tears drip like rain, looking north to the beacon smoke, the dust of the Hu is filling the sky. Pomegranate flowers are as red as blood, I dare not let my heart ripen, I sit old in Luotian Rock, with a crescent moon full of emotion. Su Zhongqing said: I am deeply afraid of wasting my youth in the dark, drizzle tells of tonight, Jiang Lang has his own colorful brush, don't use it to paint eyebrows. Full of emotion, showing off pride, writing complaints, just awake and drunk again, already tired and still singing, it is the most boring. Looking at Jiangnan said: Qingxia is a good summer, not seeing famous mountains, green trees and cool clouds迷远岫, Qing 衆 flowing water 遶明. Inquiring among the local people of Yundu, Song Yuehuan, I learned that Ma Jun had great ambitions when he was young and once rode his horse out of Hangu Pass. After ten years of wind and dust, he was depressed and could not achieve his ambitions. He returned home dejectedly and set up a school in the mountains at the Lianxi Temple to be a teacher for children, using the cup of wine to dispel the sadness in his chest, so it is appropriate that a cavity of depression overflowed in his voice.

Years ago, I drank in a restaurant in Changting and saw two seven-character poems inscribed on the wall, without the author's name. I guessed that he lived on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, and had experienced turmoil since the late Ming Dynasty. Therefore, he made broad-minded arguments, and the style was very similar to Banqiao. The poem said: (1) Why must I build a hut in the mountain village? The heart is far away, and there is more ancient meaning. It is not a taboo to plant flowers in broken urns, wild vegetables are as delicious as meat, the winter hong loves to wear a yellow cotton coat, and the daytime sleep is peaceful with a white board door, spending all day lazy and sick, letting the world be dizzy and drunk. (2) Failed brushes and incomplete books are worthless, the true joy is found here, inviting two or three good friends, chanting four or five new poems, what harm is there in crossing the border, forgetting the Jin and Qin years in autumn,혼 충 completely I am, the sound is ancient and much uncultivated, not yet opened.

### Celebrity Debts

— Leng Leng

Webster, the author of the Webster's Dictionary, accidentally received a bad check, resulting in a lawsuit.

Oliver Goldsmith, the author of the famous novel "The Vicar of Wakefield," was also arrested for owing rent.

Balzac was a very famous novelist in France, but because he owed too much debt, he dared not open the door when he heard the doorbell.

King Charles II of England was also forced by debt to sell what is now known as Pennsylvania for only 75,000 yuan to William Penn.

In his youth, Lincoln made friends with a drunkard in a grocery store, and later that grocery store unfortunately went bankrupt and the drunkard died. All the creditors demanded payment from Lincoln. Lincoln was unwilling to flee and was willing to bear all the debts himself. After eleven years of struggle, he finally suffered for others and paid off all the debts along with interest.

Whistler was the most famous calligrapher in the United States, but he was also forced by debt to borrow money from friends everywhere and pawn his own works. As a result, old debts were not cleared, and new debts came again, making him unable to cope. He had no choice but to allow the creditors to take away any items in the house as collateral. When a creditor moved a bed or a chair from his home, he would draw a bed or a chair on the floor.

The Greek philosopher Socrates was a very smart man, but he was often so poor that he could not get enough to eat. When he was about to die from poison, he suddenly remembered that he had borrowed a rooster from someone and had not yet returned it. Therefore, his last words were to ask a closest friend to return the rooster debt on his behalf.

### Exquisite Prose

— Wu Yong

In this world, there are few things that are completely perfect. Therefore, criticizing or opposing something is bound to win the approval and sympathy of the general public, and in fact, those criticisms are often correct. If you agree with or sympathize with something, it is difficult to put pen to paper, and you will inevitably be criticized and opposed. This is also true of book reviews. For a book that is not satisfactory, we can write a rather insightful review. For a profound work, it is quite difficult to write a satisfactory book review. In other words, bad books can produce good book reviews, while good books are not easy to inspire good book reviews. When Jin Shengtan of the Qing Dynasty reviewed "Talented Scholar" books such as Water Margin and Romance of the Western Chamber, he often only wrote "Wonderful," or "Wonderful, Wonderful," or "Wonderful indeed, Wonderful indeed," etc. This was because he only felt the exquisiteness of the writing, but could not immediately say where the exquisiteness lay. Yet, he could not bear not to praise it, so he had no choice but to blurt out a "Wonderful" first, and slowly ponder where the wonder lay. Ultimately, he could not figure it out, so he could only end with a "Wonderful."

### 

The "Vice Presidential" election is particularly lively because of the large number of candidates. The political views of those celebrities, and the editorials in various newspapers, are all grand and voluminous, full of lofty theories and grand arguments. They are all great essays based on political or legal standpoints. As an old man, I can only admire them. I will tell a few stories for reference, in the spirit of a rustic offering humble fare.

Generally, the term "Vice" in ordinary titles often has two functions: (1) to assist; (2) to prepare. For example, in the old imperial examinations, there were always one Chief Examiner and one Vice Examiner in each province, except for the metropolitan examination. When entering the examination hall to grade the papers, they actually graded half each, sharing the workload equally. But nominally, the Chief Examiner was the main one, and the Vice Examiner was the assistant. If one of the two suddenly had an accident and could not perform his duties or was absent, then the other one would have to review and finalize the entire list of successful candidates, bearing the entire responsibility. Therefore, at least two people had to be selected, not just to help, but also "to prepare for the unexpected." If the Chief Examiner was absent, the Vice Examiner would take charge of the whole situation. If the Vice Examiner was absent, the Chief Examiner would take charge of the whole situation. Each had a portion of the real power in grading the papers, and the preparation was a mutual function. Therefore, the interpretation of "Vice" is very flexible, but in fact, the "preparation" component is greater.

In a democratic country, next to the President is the Vice President. The difference between him and the Vice Examiner in the imperial examination is that he does not usually participate in the President's affairs, but if the President is absent, he immediately succeeds him and exercises great power. (Truman's succession to Roosevelt to complete the victory is a clear example of "once power is in hand, one will issue orders.") Therefore, the so-called "Vice" is more of a "preparation" function, and its significance is quite significant.

In the early years of the Republic of China, after Li Huangpi was elected Vice President, he issued a telegram, using elegant language to express his humble feelings, which included the phrase "Yuan Hong is prepared to serve as the heir apparent." It is said that this was the work of Secretary-General Rao Hanxiang, who was imitating the wording used for the crown prince in previous dynasties. In ancient times, the crown prince was called the "heir apparent," so some short articles in the newspapers deliberately used humorous language, saying that Li Huangpi was regarding himself as the crown prince, and what place was Yuan Keding to be put in? It seems like a joke, but in fact, "heir apparent" originally meant preparation. The crown prince's preparation to inherit the throne is in principle the same as the vice president's preparation to take over the presidency. Using established phrases, simply saying "heir apparent," is not too offensive. (The term "heir apparent" is also another name for the crown prince, but avoiding the word "emperor" is not very jarring, and taking it out of context is not unacceptable.)

Although the American Vice President has no real power, his role is extremely important. Moreover, China's "rule of law" is still in its infancy, and the situation is different from that of the United States. The preparation of "people" is even more indispensable. Therefore, is it not right that the Vice Presidential election is causing a stir far and wide, and is being watched by all eyes?

### Anecdotes

— Qian Dacheng

When Fan Bozi (a contemporary figure) of Nantong helped Qian Jisun who was in "literary confinement," it caused controversy among the literati in Nantong. Bozi's tenth daughter married Chen Sanzi, whose poetry was lean, stiff, and divinely inspired, also imitating Huang Shangu, and was indeed a master of his time. When a county established a public education center in the Confucius Temple, Bozi wrote a couplet for it: "Teaching without discrimination; Culture lies here." The collected phrases were seamless, and the context was also appropriate.
