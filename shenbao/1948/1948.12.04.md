### 蚌宿間匪軍進退維谷　國軍越北淝河追擊　戰局已進入決定性階段

[Report from our Bengbu Office, 3rd] It is learned that the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters held a military conference on the 2nd and made specific decisions on the current war situation. Military sources also stated that the future development of the war and whether significant victories can be achieved depend on the progress of the southward army corps in the Huai River area.

[Report from our Bengbu Office, 3rd] Military observers expressed confusion about the recent battles in the Bengbu-Suxian area and raised the following questions: Besides establishing a strong pocket-shaped defense, the National Army is also mobilizing a large force to strengthen its position. If the communists believe they have considerable strength, they should launch their intended offensive promptly. However, their main force has been moving south for nearly a week, yet they still hesitate and look around. If they don't believe they have a decisive advantage, they should retreat early to escape this river-crossed battlefield, which is unfavorable to them, and avoid being completely annihilated. Military personnel believe that the communists' current hesitation indicates they are trapped in a dilemma.

[Report from our Bengbu Office, 3rd] The remaining communist bandits on our front are moving north. After joining the main force near Suxian, their 6th Column is still resisting in the area north of Cao Lao Ji, attempting to block the advance of the National Army's right-wing corps. Fierce battles occurred 15 li north of Cao Lao Ji today. Also, the Huang Wei corps on the left side made further progress eastward from Da Ying Ji today.

[Report from our Bengbu Office, 3rd] The military announced at 9 PM tonight: (1) The communist 6th Column, which was blocking the National Army's advance at Yi Zhan Gang in front of Bengbu to cover the retreat of its main force, has been defeated. (Our Li Corps, attacking north along the Jinpu Railway, defeated a regiment of the column north of Cao Lao Ji and Gao Lao Jia this morning and continued to advance.) (2) The Liu Corps on the right wing, with the assistance of the air force, overcame communist resistance, captured Wang Zhuang, killed many communists, and advanced to the Jiu Wan Ji and Ren He Ji area. (3) After annihilating a communist battalion at Zhou Jia Kou, a unit on the left wing has crossed the Bei Fei River and is in pursuit.

[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Military news: The large-scale annihilation battle between Suxian and Guzhen is developing favorably. Powerful National Army corps are pressing the communists, who are shrinking between Suxian and Guzhen, from all directions, from Xuzhou in the north to the Huai River in the south and from Hongze Lake to the Grand Canal in the east. By the evening of the 2nd...

[Report from Central News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd] The National Army is approaching the victory stage in the Suxian-Bengbu battle. The communists who crossed the Bei Fei River continued to flee north across the Hui River last night. The National Army advancing north, under the cover of a powerful air force, crossed Xin Qiao this morning and is pressing toward the south bank of the Hui River. The National Army advancing south is approaching Jia Gou. The National Army deployed on both sides of the Jinpu Railway between Suxian and Lingbi is also exerting its iron fists, launching a coordinated pincer attack from east and west. The Chen Liu communist forces trapped in this marshy pocket-shaped area are seeing the situation worsening and retreating northwest, attempting to avoid complete annihilation.

[Report from United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] The East China theater has entered a decisive stage today. The Xuzhou National Army is attacking the three communist columns astride the Jinpu Railway south towards the Huai River. The National Army can meet up with the 12th Army Corps by advancing 30 miles southwest. It can reach the salient position held by the National Army on the north bank of the Hui River by advancing 60 miles southeast. The communist force attacking the Hui River line consists of seven columns, approximately 100,000 men. It is reported that they have shifted to the defensive, leaving only a small number of troops to attack in place, while the rest of the force has moved entirely. One column is heading northwest, and the other six columns are advancing south to confront the National Army advancing south from Xuzhou. The battle between the two armies will produce a decisive result.

[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 3rd] The National Army in Huaiyin took the initiative to withdraw on the 1st. Officials say it was in coordination with the Bengbu battle.

### 蚌埠形勢益穩定　淮河北四十里內無匪踪
Bengbu Situation More Stable, No Communist Traces Within 40 Li North of the Huai River

[Report from Central News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd] There are no communist traces within 40 li north of the Huai River, with Bengbu as the center. The situation in Bengbu is becoming more stable. Passenger and freight transportation on the Jinpu Railway between Bengbu and Pukou will return to normal within three days.

[Report from Central News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd] In the battle where the National Army captured Cao Lao Ji and Cao Lao Ji Station north of Bengbu, a total of two regiments of the Chen communist 6th Column and part of the 13th Column were annihilated. Also, the remaining Chen communist forces on the south bank of the Hui River still have an incomplete 6th Column, acting as the rearguard, putting up stubborn resistance to cover the retreat of their main force to the north. The National Army advancing north is attacking village by village, destroying them one by one.

[Report from Central News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd] The National Army has inflicted severe blows on the communists in the area north of the Fei River. Our Liu and Li corps launched a full-scale attack yesterday. After suffering losses, approximately 50,000 men from the remaining Chen communist 2nd, 6th, and 13th Columns retreated northwest from the He Ji and Hu Gou Ji area. In this battle, over 4,000 communists were killed, and the captured spoils of war are being inventoried. Furthermore, the main force of a unit of the communist 6th Column near Cao Lao Ji on the Jinpu Railway front in Bengbu was bravely encircled and suppressed by our corps, killing over 3,000 communists and capturing over 200 machine guns and rifles. The communists collapsed and fled to the area north of Guzhen. Our vanguard has approached Guzhen. Moreover, a military spokesperson told reporters today in a delighted tone that our southward corps are advancing rapidly, forming a pincer attack. Good news should be reported in the coming days.

[Report from our Bengbu Office, 2nd] (Late) The military released a comprehensive report as follows: The Huang Wei corps on the left flank of the National Army defeated a unit of the Liu communist 1st and 2nd Columns, totaling three regiments, near Shuang Dui on the east bank of the Bei Fei River. Approximately 50,000 men from the Chen Yi communist 2nd, 6th, 11th, and 13th Columns, who had fled to the area between the Bei Fei River and the Huai River, have been severely attacked by the Li and Liu corps in coordination with the air force from the Nanjing-Xuzhou-Bengbu bases. The communists are showing signs of collapse. The communists surrounding Xin Qiao directly north of Bengbu were also severely damaged through the cooperation of land and air forces, and the communists began to retreat. Another group of communists crossed the Bei Fei River on the 1st, attempting to harass the left wing and contain the National Army's forces. However, their attempt was crushed by the National Army's counterattack. It is said that since the National Army established an iron net on the Bei Fei River, the Qiu and Sun corps moving south have used ostrich tactics to monitor the communists from behind. The more than 200,000 remaining communist bandits who are struggling between the Hui and Fei rivers are in a state of panic and probably dare not launch a major decisive battle against the National Army in an active manner.

[Report from Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 3rd] The annihilation battle outside Zhangjiakou achieved another victory. In a fierce battle lasting nine hours in Er Tai Zi, Nan Xin Qu, Chen Jia Fang, and other places more than ten li southeast of Zhangjiakou on the 3rd, one and a half communist brigades were annihilated. The remaining communist bandits in Chen Jia Fang and Nan Xin Qu have collapsed and fled to the area south of the Yang River.

### 首都市民疏散忙　不顧危險擁擠攀登車船　交通當局正設法改善中
Residents of the Capital Busy Evacuating, Ignoring Danger and Crowding to Climb Aboard Trains and Ships, Transportation Authorities Are Trying to Improve the Situation

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Amidst the tense war situation, the residents of Nanjing are busy evacuating. Trains and ships are extremely crowded. Xiaguan Wharf and the railway station are filled with passengers and a large number of boxes and luggage waiting for trains and ships. Among them, many have been waiting for several days and still cannot leave. Ships going west from Nanjing are almost stopping in the middle of the Yangtze River. Passengers approach in small boats and climb aboard by hoisting themselves up with ropes, which is extremely dangerous. The weak and women and children can only sigh in despair at the ships. Although there are many trains departing from Xiaguan Station to Shanghai and Hangzhou every day, each one is overloaded. Whether or not one has a ticket is no longer a matter of consideration for passengers, but whether or not one has the strength to board depends. Many passengers hold tickets or assigned military tickets but cannot board the train. Every time a train enters the station, those waiting for the train swarm up without waiting for the passengers to disembark. Doors and windows are their entrances. The train that departs early in the morning enters the station after midnight. Some passengers wait at the station before the curfew the previous night in order to board the train at midnight and occupy a seat. Before dawn, those who arrive later have no place to stand. All assigned car numbers and seat numbers are invalid. Only the order in the sleeper car is slightly better, but sleeper car tickets cannot be purchased without the help of high-ranking officials. Chen Qitian, Minister of Industry and Commerce, planned to go to Shanghai on the 3rd to handle important official business, but he was unable to purchase a sleeper car ticket and could not make the trip. In the past, there were very few passengers on the Nanjing-Shanghai flights. Now, they are also fully booked every day. This crowded evacuation phenomenon in the capital has been going on for several days. It is reported that the transportation authorities are trying to improve the situation.

[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] After the Executive Yuan decided on the measures for officials of various agencies to evacuate their families back to their hometowns, the order was delivered to the affiliated agencies on the 3rd. The Ministry of Transportation is now asking the agencies to compile the number of evacuees in order to arrange special evacuation trains, so as to solve the problem of traffic order in a short period of time. Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei told reporters that the travel expenses for families returning to their hometowns will not be affected by ticket adjustments. That is, even if fares are adjusted during the specified period, families returning to their hometowns will still be charged at the current price. Two evacuation trains are designated as special trains every day. It is expected that the overcrowding situation will be reduced after the implementation.

[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, issued a notice on the 3rd stipulating measures for the evacuation of passengers and materials at the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Station. In addition, in order to address the congestion of passengers at the Xiaguan Station and wharf and the time-consuming evacuation, the Headquarters announced that starting from the evening of the 3rd, all passengers carrying luggage should temporarily postpone leaving the city. Normal passage will resume from 6 AM on the 5th.

Employees with excellent service performance may be reported to the Garrison Headquarters for commendation.

### 蔣夫人約晤美總統　前晶探視馬歇爾並作長談　杜魯門稱不擬派麥帥來華
Madame Chiang Kai-shek to Meet with the U.S. President, Previously Visited Marshall and Had a Long Conversation, Truman Says He Does Not Intend to Send MacArthur to China

[Report from Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] It was learned from official sources on the evening of the 2nd that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will visit President Truman in early next week. Truman has expressed a deep welcome to Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Madame Chiang Kai-shek will also meet with Mrs. Truman at the Blair House (the President's temporary residence) across from the White House. The State Department announced that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will formally visit Secretary of State Marshall next week.

[Report from the United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] President Truman held his first formal press conference since the November election on the 2nd. Mr. Truman said that Madame Chiang Kai-shek has made an appointment to meet with him. The President also revealed while answering other questions that he does not intend to send MacArthur to China. A reporter asked: Does the President intend to issue a policy statement on the situation in China? Truman said that he has issued such a statement three times and has nothing more to say now.

[Report from Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] President Truman's three past statements were:

(1) December 15, 1945, the President declared: "As China moves toward peace and unity, the United States stands prepared to assist the Chinese Government in every reasonable way, as the Chinese Government expands its basis, China's peaceful unity and democratic reform can be achieved."

(2) December 18, 1946, the President declared: "As China moves toward peace and a wise democratic government, we are prepared to aid China, but to avoid becoming involved in China's internal strife, we will adhere to a policy of assisting the Chinese people in building peace and economic recovery."

(3) February 18, 1948, the President declared: "The development of the situation in China is not as we had hoped, and the assistance given by the United States, even in very small amounts, cannot substitute for the necessary actions that only the Chinese Government itself can take."

[Report from United Press, Washington, 3rd] Madame Chiang, accompanied by Mrs. Marshall, traveled from Virginia to Washington on the 2nd, visiting Secretary of State Marshall, who is undergoing a physical examination at Walter Reed Hospital, from 6 PM to the evening, and talked for about an hour. The length of this visit clearly indicates that it was not an ordinary visit. It is possible to visit again on the 3rd.

[Report from Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Madame Chiang Kai-shek has begun activities here and will meet with President Truman within days. It is also heard that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will visit Mrs. Truman. Smith, Chairman of the Committee on Oversight of Foreign Aid Programs of the U.S. Congress, said: This committee is scheduled to meet on the 3rd and should listen to Madame Chiang Kai-shek's report. I firmly believe that this committee will agree to listen to the report, but it is also equally certain that this committee has no right to call for emergency military aid to China. The continuation of military or military supplies to China should be decided by the President, the Secretary of State, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. What we urgently hope for is to help China recover.

### 麥帥關懷我局勢　職責所在仍應留居日本
MacArthur Cares About Our Situation, But Should Still Stay in Japan Due to His Responsibilities

[Report from Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] People close to General MacArthur said on the 3rd that since President Truman has announced that he will not send MacArthur to China, MacArthur felt relieved that the suspense had been resolved and was quite pleased. A senior source said: MacArthur has been in the military his whole life and is of course interested in the trip to China, but he believes that his responsibilities lie in staying in Japan to rebuild it. Although MacArthur did not doubt his own ability to reverse the situation in China, some subordinates believed that it would be a futile effort, so they may have dissuaded MacArthur from going to China. The initial reaction in Japan to the President's declaration was excellent. Most Japanese do not want MacArthur to leave, but many also believe that it would be a good strategy if MacArthur used his achievements in governing Japan to solve difficulties and rebuild peace and unity in China. It is also learned that MacArthur has told his subordinates about strategic plans to improve the situation in China. It is further learned that he has been very concerned about the situation in China for a long time. Another telegram from Washington on the 3rd attracted his attention, which was that the Soviet representative to the Far East Commission, Pan Youxin, attacked MacArthur's occupation administration. People close to MacArthur said that he regarded Pan's words as "propaganda" and did not bother to pay attention to them. Although the Allied Headquarters has repeatedly received requests from news reporters to issue a statement in response to Pan, not a word has been announced so far. A U.S. official said that this type of statement from the Soviet Union has no effect on MacArthur.

Editorial

### Rapidly Determine an Asian Revival Plan

The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has recently been meeting in Labusdong City, Hanzhou, to review major plans for Asian economic recovery, attracting the attention of people from various countries concerned in the East. Especially today, when the Asian crisis is deepening, the commission's discussion of this issue is felt to be of extraordinary significance.

Indian representative Mr. Taisai expressed his views on the 2nd, believing that if Asia does not have a plan similar to the European Recovery Program, the forces of communism will inevitably control the entire continent. Therefore, he advocated that the commission should pass the $13 billion Asian Recovery Program. At the same time, he expressed dissatisfaction with the American government's emphasis on Europe and neglect of Asia, saying, "The recent American statement that Asia should be developed by private capital is a mistaken view. Only the Marshall Plan currently implemented in Western Europe can meet Asia's urgent needs. Western powers should not on the one hand call on Eastern countries to rectify their internal affairs, while on the other hand not provide assistance to enable us to do so. To think that the Western European recovery plan is sufficient to ensure the entire world is not threatened by international communism is both a mistake and an absurdity. It must be understood that the European Recovery Program may be able to preserve Europe for a time, but if Asia does not have a similar recovery program, communism will ultimately achieve total victory." After reading Mr. Taisai's speech, every sentence is the truth, and every word is good advice, which can be said to be truly heartwarming. But I wonder what the American people who advocate emphasizing Europe and neglecting Asia think of it.

Looking at Asia today, we certainly do not want to frighten the public by saying how severe the Asian crisis is. However, the facts placed before our eyes are ironclad. Whether you are willing or not, you cannot help but admit that the chaotic phenomenon in Southeast Asia shows the severity of the threat of communist forces felt by various countries, and the stalemate in the Korean issue and the rebellion in South Korea are enough to illustrate that Northeast Asia is also in imminent danger. Coupled with the rapid decline of the situation in China, the communist troops have almost invaded the heart of the government. Looking to the future, there is much to be done with our efforts. Under such a critical situation, if the Western powers do not want to safeguard world peace, they must first rescue Asia. The gains and losses are clear at a glance. The American diplomatic authorities have not yet made a final decision on the Chinese crisis, and still say that the entire Asia should be developed by private capital and do not want to adopt the Asian Recovery Program. No matter from which perspective you observe it, it is still unwise of American diplomacy. If this delay continues, it will inevitably create a historic mistake in Asia and will be regretted too late.

Who can not recognize that China is the only stabilizing force in Asia, and its every move is enough to affect the overall situation. "To conquer Asia, you must first conquer China." The Japanese militarists thought so in the past, and the new aggressive country today—the Soviet Union—also thinks so. The Chinese Communists' armed rebellion and desire to seize power are harboring the insidious conspiracy to act as a vanguard for the Communist International. The Chinese government and people are sparing no effort to "sincerely seek assistance," not entirely for their own sake, but also for the sake of the entire Asia not being threatened by communist forces. Some say that the United States not only has a moral responsibility to aid China, but it is also an act that benefits both itself and others, which can be called the fairest and most correct argument. If the United States sees itself as a rich man and others as "beggars," only has a kind of "almsgiving" mentality, and even loses heart halfway, it will inevitably harm others and itself!

The President recently made a solemn statement to Mr. Fang En, Vice President of the Associated Press in Beijing, regarding the Marshall Plan for Asia. The general public in China does not hope that the United States will declare bankruptcy by aiding China and other Asian countries, but all believe that the United States should implement the Marshall Plan in Asia. Therefore, in the Far East Economic Committee, except for the Soviet Union, no country's representative did not express support. However, by studying the Soviet Union's motives for opposing the Asian Marshall Plan and listening to the speech of the Soviet representative, Mr. Novikov, one can "see through his tricks." Novikov said, "The Soviet Union opposes solving Asian problems with the Asian Marshall Plan because the Asian Marshall Plan will turn the vast areas of Asia into objects of aggression by Anglo-American imperialism." The implied meaning is self-evident. All Asian countries are sincerely seeking assistance, but the United States is still hesitant and looking around, making people feel that the American foreign policy is truly "unfathomable." I hope that the American diplomatic authorities will reconsider the speech of the Indian representative Mr. He Zhang. What to do and where to go, make a wise decision quickly!

### Legislative Yuan Urges Hainan Island to Become a Province; Executive Yuan Principally Accepts; Orders Ministry of Interior and Relevant Agencies to Prepare Appropriately; Tax Revenue and Governance of Territory Still Need Planning

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding the matter of Hainan Island becoming a province, the Legislative Yuan consulted the Executive Yuan, requesting immediate implementation. The Executive Yuan has principally indicated acceptance and has recently replied to the Legislative Yuan, saying: "Your esteemed Yuan's consultation No. 294 on the 17th of September, 37th year, is fully understood. The Executive Yuan principally accepts the proposal for the establishment of Hainan Island as a province. However, the total annual tax revenue of the island's sixteen counties in the 36th year, combined from provincial and county levels, is only about 1,300 gold yuan. Among them, Baisha, Baoting, and Ledong counties are entirely dependent on the provincial treasury for funding. The local area is barren, and finances are exhausted. This is something that should be planned for before the province is established. Furthermore, the island is surrounded by sea on all sides, and the entire territory is mountainous. Bandit troops have been entrenched for many years, appearing and disappearing unpredictably in remote mountains and coastal areas. Currently, the only accessible places on the island are Haikou in the north and Yulin in the south. It is necessary to first organize and train security forces to suppress them before security can be ensured and administrative orders can be implemented. This is something that should be planned for before the province is established. Moreover, in addition to the main island, the surrounding islands are numerous, such as the Dongsha, Xisha, Zhongsha, and Nansha islands, scattered like stars in the southernmost territorial waters of our country. How they should be administered to form a constellation guarding the area and secure the territory is something that should be planned for before the province is established. The above points are all factual issues that must be considered. It seems appropriate to prepare for them in advance and gradually resolve them so that after the province is established, various facilities can be smoothly promoted, not only forming a province but also serving as a frontier defense. This differs slightly from the steps in your esteemed Yuan's decision to establish a province, but the intention is the same. The Ministry of Interior has already been ordered to consult with relevant agencies to prepare appropriately and implement it at the appropriate time. Furthermore, funds for pacifying the province will be generously allocated under the provincial and municipal subsidy budget item for the next year. With your prior approval, we respectfully request your review."

### The West Refuses to Recognize the New Berlin City Government; Liaison Officers Ordered to Retreat; The Last Symbol of Four-Power Cooperation Disappears

[Associated Press, Berlin, 2nd] Britain, the United States, and France have announced their refusal to recognize the new Berlin city government and have withdrawn the liaison officers formerly stationed at the city hall. US military commander Howley said that the Germans who established a divided government were committing a crime and that the Soviet Union was systematically destroying the four-power agreement.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 2nd, Associated Press] Britain, the United States, and France today ordered their liaison officers to withdraw from the Soviet-controlled city government, thus eliminating the last symbol of cooperation between the Western three countries and the Soviet Union in Berlin. At that time, the Soviet side refused to allow the liaison officers of the three countries to withdraw unless their luggage was first searched. After a five-hour standoff, the Soviet side allowed it. Informed sources said that the next step may be to make the German mark issued by the West the only legal currency in West Berlin, although the mark issued by the Soviet side will still circulate informally. Both Berlin city governments met today. The legitimate government met in the American sector, and the German communist government met in the Soviet sector city hall. Berlin university students held an anti-Western demonstration in the Soviet sector.

### Opposition to Returning Ruhr Mining Sovereignty to Germany; French Parliament Passes Resolution; West Germany's Three Occupation Zones to Merge

[Agencie France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] The French Parliament today, by a vote of 377 to 181, passed a motion proposed by the majority party. The motion requested the French government to declare to the British and American governments the French people's support for the government's protest against the British and American governments' proposal to place the sovereignty of the Ruhr mining industry under the control of a future German government, as announced in Ordinance No. 75, and unanimously opposed it. A motion proposed by Communist Party members, requesting Parliament to send a committee to investigate the current situation in Germany, especially in the Ruhr region, was defeated by a vote of 411 to 181.

Foreign Minister Schuman stated beforehand, "The German and French occupation zones will soon merge with the British and American zones. For the benefit of France, we wish this to happen smoothly. Currently, the three countries' commanders-in-chief in Germany are reviewing the terms of the merger, which do not include France's participation in the Ruhr control mechanism as a condition for the merger of the three zones. After the merger of the three zones, France should be able to participate in the Ruhr control mechanism on an equal footing." Regarding the decision of Britain and the United States to return the sovereignty of the Ruhr mining industry to a future German government, Schuman said, "France fundamentally opposes this decision. However, discussing this issue is not currently the most pressing matter. This should be stipulated in the peace treaty. Our goal is to prevent the re-establishment of any centralized state that endangers peace, whether it be a capitalist or nationalist centralized state."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] The six-nation conference on the Ruhr issue did not discuss the issue today as it awaited the US response to France's proposals on the management of the Ruhr mining industry.

Welcoming the Participation of Journalist Groups from Free Nations

He is currently in discussions with the British side. This "International Free Journalist Organization" will unite journalist groups from the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the Scandinavian countries, as well as all other free nations in the world. Two weeks ago, Martin withdrew from the meeting of the International Organization of Journalists held in Budapest. He said that the reason he withdrew the American Newspaper Guild from the above organization was because the Soviet Union and its satellite countries were using the organization's meetings for Soviet propaganda. He said that the number of journalists from free countries at the Budapest meeting was in a ratio of one to two with the number of journalists from the Soviet bloc, failing to achieve any constructive results.

### Five, Including Kido, Sato, and Togo, Appeal Again to US Supreme Court; Mei Ru'ao Believes This is Just a Delaying Tactic

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Japanese war criminals Shigenori Shigemitsu, Hoshio Okazaki, Kenryo Sato, Koichi Kido, and Shigenori Togo today applied to the US Supreme Court through their American lawyer, Logan, for an appeal, requesting that the Far East International Military Tribunal's verdict be declared invalid, claiming that the tribunal was illegally established by MacArthur. The charges against the five defendants could not be established under international law or in US civil and military courts, and the conviction was a violation of the US Constitution. The US Supreme Court had previously received appeals from Doihara and Hirota, but Tojo and the other five war criminals who were also sentenced to death had not filed appeals.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge who attended the Far East International Military Tribunal, told the Central News Agency reporter this afternoon that the US Supreme Court has no right to review or amend the Far East International Military Tribunal's verdicts on the 25 top Japanese war criminals. The fact that the defense lawyers of Doihara and the other seven defendants have appealed to the US Supreme Court is tantamount to questioning General MacArthur's personal authority as an American citizen. In their appeal, they are questioning the US Supreme Court not about the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal, but about whether MacArthur's execution of the tribunal's verdict in his capacity as an American citizen violates the US Constitution. Dr. Mei continued, although General MacArthur's authority is based on international agreements, it is still subject to the laws of his own country. Therefore, the US Supreme Court must decide whether MacArthur can execute the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal. However, the US Supreme Court will certainly not say that MacArthur has no right to execute it, and will support it. The actions taken by the war criminals' defense lawyers are a "delaying tactic" and have no effect on the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal itself.

### Exquisite Counterfeit US Dollars are Being Circulated in the United States

### Pan Yuqing Criticizes MacArthur Again, Saying He Failed to Disarm Japan; Reiterates Proposal to Build Japan's Peaceful Industry

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Soviet Ambassador Pan Yuqing criticized MacArthur at today's regular meeting of the Far Eastern Commission for failing to take "appropriate measures" to disarm Japan. He said, "We have reason to doubt" whether MacArthur is implementing the Far Eastern Commission's resolution on disarming Japan. "Some Americans" are unwilling to endlessly develop Japan's non-war industries, mainly "because Japan will be a strong competitor of American goods." Pan also proposed the original Soviet proposal, advocating the development of Japan's non-war industries and the establishment of an international organization to prevent the revival of Japan's war industries. This proposal was opposed by the United States. The US representative to the Far Eastern Commission, McCoy, said that an international joint management organization should not be established before the final peace treaty is signed.

### Korean Commission Appeals to UN General Assembly for North-South Korean Peace Talks to be Held Before US-Soviet Troop Withdrawal

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The United Nations Korean Commission is strenuously promoting the swift unification of the entire peninsula under the rule of the South Korean government supported by the United States. The Commission criticized the hostile communist state established in the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea. In its final report to the UN General Assembly, the Commission reiterated its endorsement of the May 10 election formula used in both Koreas under the aegis of the United States. The Commission observed the election in South Korea and concurred with the formation of the South Korean government.

It pointed out that the Soviet Union refused the Commission entry into North Korea to observe the elections, and the Communists automatically established their government. The Commission declared that the Korean people all desire unification and that unification must begin before the withdrawal of US and Soviet occupation forces, otherwise, hostile actions may lead to civil war. After the Political Committee stops debating the Palestine issue, the Commission's report will be immediately submitted to the Political Committee. The United States and Australia are promoting a proposal to obtain direct recognition of the Seoul government. The Commission's conclusion states: "Even if the effective administrative authority of the Seoul government has not extended to North Korea, the view must be maintained that this government has the basis for achieving unification through peaceful negotiations. At least, from an economic standpoint, this unification is very important." The Commission declared that some steps to establish peaceful negotiations are imperative and that these negotiations must begin before the withdrawal of the occupying forces, otherwise, civil war may break out. The Commission's report stated: "The Korean issue is only one aspect of the current international relations competition." The Commission believes: "The tensions between North and South Korea have been reduced over time, and all Korean people, regardless of their political tendencies or social standing, are unanimous in their dissatisfaction with the current state of disunity." The Commission believes: "In view of the social, political, and economic well-being of South Korea, rapid unification is absolutely essential." The Commission stated that in the May 10 South Korean elections, 75 percent of the electorate voted, and the results fully demonstrate the free will of the voters.

### Postponing the Korean Issue is Tantamount to Aiding the Communists

Rhee Syngman Expresses Dissatisfaction with the UN General Assembly

[United Press, Seoul, 3rd] Korean President Rhee Syngman issued a statement at a press conference today, stating that the UN General Assembly's proposal to postpone the discussion of the Korean issue has been telegraphed by observers attending the General Assembly. This move will only aid communist terrorists and the new government in fighting. The communists always want to buy time to implement communization, so why give them this convenience? It is difficult to understand why the General Assembly cannot decide on the Korean issue now. The US and South Korea have already implemented the plan agreed upon by the General Assembly, so taking final action does not require much time.

### US-South Korea Aid Agreement to be Signed Within Days

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 3rd] The agreement concluded between the two countries stationed in South Korea, originally scheduled to be signed this afternoon, has been postponed to a later date due to errors in the Korean translation.

The agreement was originally scheduled to be signed today by US Representative to South Korea John J. Muccio and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok and Finance Minister Kim Pyo-heon representing the US and South Korea, respectively.

### Security Council Decides to Postpone Action on Israel's Membership Application; Political Committee Passes New US Proposal

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The United Nations Security Council discussed Israel's application for membership today and immediately decided to refer the issue to a special committee, which will include all eleven members of the Security Council. Previously, the US and the UK each held different views. US Representative Jessup urged the Security Council to immediately admit Israel, while UK Representative Cadogan opposed this action, believing that the time was too early and pointing out that the UN General Assembly's Political Committee was still discussing the Palestine partition issue. The Soviet Union supported Israel's request.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The US and UK's proposal to merge the Arab part of Palestine with Transjordan was rejected by the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on the 3rd. The merger plan was originally proposed by the late mediator Bernadotte. The Political Committee rejected it by a vote of 26 to 18, with 12 abstentions. US Representative Rusk argued that the Political Committee should pass new articles of the plan separately, without mentioning Bernadotte's recommendations, but instructing the tripartite mediation team to "assist the authorities concerned in finally resolving all important issues." Rusk admitted that the goal was to give the mediation team the power to consider thorny border issues. It is believed that if the US-proposed articles are passed, the Bernadotte recommendations will be mentioned again during negotiations. The Political Committee passed the US-proposed articles by a vote of 42 to 2, with the Soviet bloc and the six Arab countries abstaining unanimously. Therefore, the British and American plan to adopt the Bernadotte plan as the basis for the final settlement of the Holy Land has been completely overturned by the committee. Those who opposed the British and American proposal were the Soviet bloc, the Arab countries, and pro-Israel countries. When the UK and the US tried to insert Bernadotte's border plan into the UN mediation strategy on the 2nd, they were also rejected by the above three opposing groups. The Political Committee's unwillingness to transfer the Arab part of Palestine to the jurisdiction of Transjordan, which is supported by the UK, is tantamount to tacitly approving the Palestine partition plan passed by the UN General Assembly last year. From the debate to the voting, the cloud of the Arab League split finally surfaced. Transjordan is not a member of the United Nations, so it could not vote. The six Arab countries and the Muslim or quasi-Muslim countries unanimously opposed the merger of Palestine into Transjordan, a member of the Arab League.

### Truman Tells Reporters that the Cabinet Will Not Change for the Time Being; the US Will Never Allow German Trusts to Revive

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] President Truman received reporters for the first time today after the US election. Someone asked whether the rumors that he was planning to reorganize his cabinet were true. The President replied that he had asked every cabinet member to continue to serve at this time, and all cabinet members had agreed. He specifically mentioned Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal. He was asked whether the US defense spending for next year would be limited to $15 billion, as he had previously specified.

### Jiangya Ship on Shanghai-Ningbo Route Encounters Danger; Sinks at Litongsha Last Night; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Receives Telegram and Dispatches Feixiang Ship for Rescue

[Our Reporter] The Jiangya ship, a regular ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo route of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, encountered danger and sank at Yangmian, Litongsha, outside the Wusongkou at around 8 p.m. last night. The Shanghai Coastal Telegraph of the Ministry of Communications received a distress telegram from the Huazheng ship at 10 p.m. last night, stating that the Jiangya ship had encountered danger and was sinking, and requesting that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company be notified for rescue. Upon receiving the telegram, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company immediately dispatched the Feixiang fast ship to the scene for rescue.

### Mayor Wu's Prediction: Index Will Decrease This Month; High Price for Ration Rice is to Prevent Rice Shortage

[Our Reporter] After the authorities announced the price of ration rice for November in the city at 310 yuan per dan (unit of dry measure), all sectors expressed surprise because the ration price exceeded the market price. It has been learned that the high ration price was actually recommended by the city government. Mayor Wu had previously told reporters that the city government must consider two points when determining the price of ration rice: (1) Based on the experience of the rice rush that occurred in various places during the price control period, it is known that sufficient rice reserves are the basis of security. (2) The relationship between rice prices and the cost of living index, as high rice prices may affect the increase in the cost of living index, which the city government should also pay attention to. In view of the first point above, the city government decided to try to raise the ration price so that rice would not be snapped up all at once, and rice merchants would be motivated to purchase rice from various places, thus making the city's rice reserves sufficient. If the ration price is too low, citizens will rush to buy it, and if it forms an inverted relationship with the producing areas, rice will not come to Shanghai. Therefore, after the announcement of the ration price for this period, Mayor Wu said that the source of rice for the city this month will definitely be smooth, and there will definitely be no rice shortage.

Preventing Increase in Index; Organizing Key Rationing

However, the city government also considered whether setting a high ration price will affect the increase in the cost of living index. For this reason, the authorities decided to implement a key rationing system for public school teachers and journalists. Because the unit of rice quantity in the cost of living index calculation is eight dou, after the implementation of the key rationing system, four dou will definitely be calculated at 230 yuan per dan, so the cost of living index is expected to be unaffected. Mayor Wu also told reporters yesterday that he predicted that the cost of living index this month will be stable. Because there is no fluctuation in rice prices and the prices of various commodities have fallen, although public utilities will be adjusted, the increase is not significant. He also said that the cost of living index will definitely not be falsified. After the index of 8.1 times on the first half of November was announced on the 15th, it once rose to 18.2 times on the 16th. Later, due to the decline in prices, it was 15.4 times when it was released at the end of the month. He also said that the index for this month is likely to fall. He said that the industrial and commercial sectors are extremely difficult, and the cost of living index really cannot rise anymore.

### Fare Adjustment on Two Railways; It is Said that the Principles Have Been Decided

### Increase in Passenger and Freight Rates for Ships; Approved by Ministry of Communications; Implemented on the 6th

[Our Reporter] The shipping industry association, due to the request of various companies to readjust passenger and freight rates, had resolved to increase all current freight rates and ticket prices by 45% and submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. It was scheduled to adjust the prices today. According to news from the shipping association yesterday, the Ministry of Communications approved the 45% increase but changed the implementation date to the 6th. Therefore, various companies have been notified to increase prices from the 6th (Monday).

### Public Utilities to Increase Prices; Expected to be Implemented Around the 10th

Public utilities will increase prices again. The Shanghai Power Company was the first to submit a request to the Public Utilities Bureau. It is reported that the Public Utilities Bureau is currently calculating the costs of the eight major public utility companies. After the new public utility cost accounting and pricing rules recently drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce arrive in a few days, it will invite the companies to calculate the selling price according to the newly formulated formula. It is expected to be announced and implemented around the 10th of this month.

### Civil Aviation Group Ready for Relocation to the South; Central Air Transport Corporation and China National Aviation Corporation Also Prepared

[Our Reporter] The headquarters of Chennault's Civil Air Transport (CAT) has recently been completely relocated to Guangzhou. In the future, only a landing station will be left in the city. The group's important equipment and facilities began to be transported several weeks ago, and the staff also flew south one after another, which was completed by yesterday. As for the Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) and the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), they are also fully prepared. However, according to the heads of the two companies, no matter what kind of emergency situation arises, the airline companies will definitely be the last to evacuate. This was the case during the War of Resistance, and they should still maintain it until the last moment.

### National Banks and Bureaus Ordered to Restrict Remittances to South China

[Our Reporter] Recently, due to the situation, the phenomenon of capital flowing south has become significant again.

### United Nations Far East Information Office Denies Relocation to the Philippines

[Our Reporter] According to the United Nations Office in Shanghai, Dr. Faust, Director of the United Nations Far East Information Office, firmly denied yesterday the rumors that the office would move from Shanghai to Manila. He said that the United Nations Far East Information Office's area of operation includes China, the Philippines, and Siam, and it also has activities in several so-called affiliated territories. Setting up the office in Shanghai is for better coordination of work. In order to strengthen close ties within the area of operation, such work has been planned for a long time and is now being implemented. He himself had planned to go to Bangkok and Manila for inspection three weeks ago, but canceled the trip. Zhu Baoxian, the director of the Shanghai office, has gone instead.

### US Information Service Statement: No Intention to Move

[US Information Service News] As reported in the city's newspapers, the US Information Service office will move to Manila. The US Information Service today specifically denied this, stating that there is no intention to move to Manila or elsewhere. It is understood that this news came from Manila and concerned the rumored relocation of the United Nations Asian News Office.

Furthermore, the Associated Press issued a correction yesterday, stating: Yesterday's translation of the Manila telegram (regarding the Southern Relocation and New Opening) was due to a momentary oversight, which mistakenly referred to the United Nations Office in Shanghai as the US Information Service. We kindly request that it be corrected.

### Fundraising for Comfort Mission: Gathering Medicine to Comfort Troops in Bengbu

The Shanghai All Circles Comfort Mission to the Bandit Suppression Soldiers is currently collecting various comfort items and will soon depart for the front lines in Bengbu to provide comfort. The mission, recognizing the severe shortage of medicines and supplies in the front-line military hospitals, plans to solicit a large quantity of medicines, such as penicillin, anti-inflammatory tablets, pain relievers, gauze, and medical cotton, to bring with them to Bengbu to meet the urgent needs of the front lines. They deeply hope that patriotic individuals from all walks of life in the city will enthusiastically donate and send items to the "Friends of the Military Society" at 180 Zhabu Road, from where the mission will transport them. Alternatively, they can notify the mission by phone (40145), and representatives will be dispatched to collect the donations.

### Impoverished Students Awaiting Aid: Soliciting Donations for Winter Clothing Fails to Materialize

The Shanghai Student Relief Committee plans to sew and distribute 2,000 cotton coats to aid impoverished students in various schools. This requires 400 bolts of cloth, not to mention the cost of cotton and labor. This summer, the Nie Qiaosong Hall and Nie Chongde Hall donated 90 bolts of cloth, but this is still far from the goal. Therefore, they earnestly hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate materials or cash to support this charitable cause. The committee's address is inside the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge. Telephone: 84040.

### Dockworkers at China Merchants Bureau Sentenced in Manslaughter Case

[Our Report] Liu Ancai, Liu Qinghua, Wu Yuanshun, Yang Kaiyong, Peng Baoan, and Zhao Chengli, Wu Haishan (who are still at large), workers at the fourth dock of the China Merchants Bureau in this city, attempted to control the dockworkers' union. Without obtaining approval from the Social Affairs Bureau, they convened a general meeting in November of last year and elected Liu Ancai and five others as the new union executive committee, causing a dispute with the old executive committee member Wu Decai. They then incited a mob to surround and beat Wu, who was injured and died after being sent to the hospital. After reporting the case to the police, the local court yesterday sentenced Liu Ancai to ten years in prison and deprived him of his civil rights for five years for the crime of jointly inflicting injury leading to death.

### Mayor Shakes Head, Sighing: Financial Deficit Exceeds Eight Million

[Our Report] Yesterday, when this reporter asked Mayor Wu Guozhen how he planned to remedy the city government's extreme financial shortfall, Mayor Wu shook his head and sighed, "It's terrible!" He stated that in November, the city government, due to its inability to balance income and expenditure, had requested a subsidy of eight million yuan from the central government. However, there has been no response to date. The city government has been forced to borrow five million yuan from the Central Bank as an emergency measure to barely maintain operations. How things will proceed in the future is still unknown. It is estimated that the city's financial deficit for this month will exceed eight million yuan, and a subsidy will again be requested from the Executive Yuan.

### Speaker Pan Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing: Expresses Views on the Current Situation; Earnestly Hopes Citizens Will Rise Up, Jointly Defend and Save the Nation; Land and Sea Cooperation Means There is Absolutely No Problem in the Jiangnan Region

Speaker Pan Gongzhan, when returning to Shanghai from Nanjing at 10:00 yesterday morning, met with reporters at the train station and was asked about the purpose of his trip to Nanjing and his impressions. Mr. Pan said: "Yesterday morning, Chairman Fang Xikong and I went to Nanjing for the Air Force Comfort Mission to discuss and arrange matters. We took the opportunity to visit Ambassador Stuart, and, standing on the people's position, reiterated our hope that the United States would accelerate its aid to China to repel the expansion of communist forces in China. I also explained that Shanghai is a major international city, and the business interests of Britain and the United States are deeply involved. Chinese and foreign residents alike have a need to assist the government in maintaining local order and stabilizing society." The Ambassador seemed to agree and revealed that foreign businesses had no intention of withdrawing easily. "At 4:30 PM, I visited the President, and Chairman Fang and Chairman Zhang Daofan reported on their experiences comforting the front lines in Xuzhou. I also reported on the recent efforts of Shanghai community leaders to launch self-help and national salvation work, preparing to use the power of the people to support the head of state in suppressing the rebellion. I earnestly hope that the central authorities will remain calm and resolute, calling on the people of the whole country to rise up together to defend and save the nation, and achieve the goals of anti-communism, anti-totalitarianism, and anti-aggression." The President believed that people from all walks of life in Shanghai deeply understood the greater good and could express their patriotic spirit through action. He was pleased and said that he would again telegraph community leaders Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyin, Qian Xinzhi, An Runqing, and Li Fusun to come to Nanjing to listen to their opinions for consideration.

"At 8:00 PM, Chairman Fang and I went to the Air Force Xinsheng Society to hold a grand comfort evening. At that time, there were over a thousand Air Force officers and soldiers present, a gathering of talents, full of spirit. Chairman Fang and I first explained the sincerity of the five million people of the city in expressing their respect and comfort to the flying generals. When the members of the Air Force Comfort Mission arrived in Nanjing by train at 10:00 PM, we presented brocade banners and began the dance party. Because I had important matters to deal with in Shanghai, I took the night train back to Shanghai. From various signs, the government is determined to respect public opinion and make a fresh start with the people. Moreover, the Battle of Bengbu on the front line is solidifying, and yesterday came the good news that the bandit army had begun to retreat north due to being caught in a pincer attack. In addition, with the cooperation of our naval and air forces, it will be even more difficult for the bandit army to cross the Yangtze River, so there is absolutely no problem with security in the Jiangnan region. Some civilians from the capital are flocking to Shanghai by train, and the train station is a bit crowded. Passenger trains are also delayed due to frequent military transport, which is an unavoidable phenomenon in wartime. However, according to my observation, if our compatriots in the rear truly wish to avoid the brutal rule of the communists, they must unite as one, contribute money and effort, and defeat the bandit army. This is the only thorough solution, and escape will not solve the problem. Shanghai is a glorious city of the "January 28th" and "August 13th" anti-Japanese wars. The waterway has a sea outlet that allows international exchanges, and the land route has a large army stationed along the two roads and in the counties along the Yangtze River. In addition, the central government has newly established the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters for unified command. As long as our citizens work together and vigorously promote self-defense training to maintain local order, generously contribute to comfort the soldiers, help wounded officers and soldiers and displaced refugees, and eliminate the barriers between various levels, coordinating labor-management relations with the overall situation as the prerequisite, then we can help ourselves and others. I dare to believe that not only can the area south of the Yangtze River be as solid as a rock, but also the morale of the front-line soldiers will be even more vigorous due to the stability in the rear. The conspiracy of the bandit army, under the direction of foreign races, to enslave the people of the whole country will ultimately fail."

### General Situation of Various Universities: Students from Distant Provinces Face Financial Difficulties; Many Request to Leave School and Return Home to Study as Guests; Most Schools Have Not Considered Early Holidays

[Our Report] Due to the turbulent situation, some students from various schools in this city have been requesting leave from school. This reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of each university yesterday. The situations of each school are listed below:

Tongji

The university's administrative meeting decided to accept students' requests. Self-funded students whose families are located inland and who are facing financial difficulties will be allowed to request leave to return to their hometown and study as guests at nearby universities. Credit earned while studying as a guest will be recognized in the future. The school officially announced this information yesterday, and students who urgently need to return home have suspended their studies and left to arrange travel expenses. In addition, the school is facing a food shortage, with only enough supplies to last until the day after tomorrow (the 6th). The school has requested assistance from the People's Mediation Committee, which has agreed to consider the request. According to Dean of Academic Affairs Xia Jianbai, Tongji has approximately 3,000 students, half of whom are self-funded. A portion of the self-funded students are from Sichuan and Hunan. Recently, due to rising prices in this city, remittances from home have been insufficient, leading to financial difficulties. Two weeks ago, they requested that the school allow them to return to their hometown to study as guests at nearby universities, so that family support would be easier and their studies would not be interrupted. The remaining students in the school will continue to attend classes as usual according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education. In addition, Tongji President Ding Wenyuan has requested to resign for the second time due to angina pectoris, but the Ministry of Education has not yet approved his request.

Jiaotong

Student organizations and departments at the university recently signed petitions requesting that the school store three months' worth of food to cope with emergencies. The Student Union held an emergency meeting of department representatives at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss and decide on several points: (1) Under no circumstances will the school be relocated. Students are called upon not to leave the school. (2) Representatives will be selected by the school's professors, students, and police, and will go to Nanjing together to request that the Ministry of Education advance three months' salary for professors and police, and three months' worth of public funds for students. (3) The school should economize on expenses and find ways to borrow money from the Central Bank to store food. (4) Students will pool their money to purchase and store food, and will implement a power-saving campaign. (5) The school should dig wells on campus. (6) The school's professors, students, and police will jointly establish a contingency organization. According to Zhuo, the person in charge of the school, storing three months' worth of food is feasible in principle, but the Ministry of Education may not have enough funds to allocate. The school is currently studying the matter. A small number of students have requested leave to return home, but the school has decided to continue classes as usual.

Jinan

University President Li Shouyong stated that whether the school will have an early holiday has not yet been decided. The school's food supply can barely be maintained in the short term, but fuel is difficult to obtain and the school's finances cannot bear the burden. Some students have already requested leave to return home.

St. John's

The school is raising funds from students' parents, which is not as good as Lijiang. It is reported that the school is able. May have this semester end early this month

Soochow

University President Yang Yongqing stated that some students have requested leave to return home, but the number is small. Whether to have an early holiday has not yet been discussed. The food issue is being planned step by step.

Fudan

University President Zhang Yi stated: "The school is currently stable."

### Deputy Manager of Qichang Bank Accused of Embezzlement: Wei Zhonghuai Denies Collusion in Extortion

[Our Report] Xia Peide, an auditor from the Shanghai Financial Administration of the Ministry of Finance, was dispatched in mid-July to inspect the large borrowers of the Shanghai branch of Qichang Bank and the truth about the bank's overdue exchanges on the 13th of the same month. He allegedly colluded with Wei Zhonghuai, the bank's deputy manager, to forge an inspection report and extorted four gold bars from Zhu Sui under false pretenses. After the Financial Administration discovered this, it reported the case to the Ministry of Finance, which transferred the case to the local prosecutor's office for investigation. During the investigation, Xia Peide fled. Wei Zhonghuai was prosecuted on suspicion of embezzlement. The case was heard in the local court at 3:00 PM yesterday. The defendant, Wei Zhonghuai, and the witness, Qichang Manager Li Zijing, were summoned. Wei Zhonghuai testified: "Xia was dispatched to inspect the accounts on July 15. At noon on the 17th, I and the bank's commissioner, Liu Mingyang, invited Xia to lunch at Xinya. On the evening of the 19th, Xia invited me to his home to talk. Xia said that there were problems with the accounts, which he had already discovered, but had not yet made a report. He then clearly stated that civil servants' salaries were low and their lives were difficult, and he hoped that the bank would provide him with four gold bars, equivalent to one day's income, as a living allowance. I dared not agree and reported Xia's request to Manager Li Zijing the next morning, who immediately rejected it. That evening, I replied to Xia, politely refusing his request. On the morning of the 23rd, I received a letter containing an anonymous extortion note and an inspection report unfavorable to Qichang Bank. I took the report to Manager Li for discussion. Li said that it looked like extortion and intended to report it to the directors and supervisors stationed at the bank. That afternoon, I returned to my home in Suzhou for personal matters. When I returned to Shanghai on the 25th, I learned that Li had reported the matter to the Financial Administration for thorough investigation." The court asked why, if he had already refused Xia's request, he had later sent two letters saying, "My two young children are still studying at university, and each needs four stones of rice to pay tuition next semester. Please help me at that time"? Wei was speechless and did not answer. Witness Li Zijing testified: "After Wei sent me the inspection report sent by the anonymous person, I discussed it with the directors and supervisors stationed at the bank and believed that Xia was suspected of extortion. We reported the matter to the Financial Administration for thorough investigation." He also said that according to his observation, the defendant was only responsible for conveying the message and did not collude with Xia. The court ordered a further investigation by the Financial Administration and adjourned the hearing. The defendant was released on bail with a written guarantee of 50,000 gold yuan.

### This Newspaper Collects Donations for Honoring Teachers

In the past half month, this newspaper has received letters from readers expressing indignation at the second tuition increase by private primary and secondary schools in this city, or at the "school shop" style of private school authorities, and requesting that the competent authorities ban them; others have expressed sympathy for the difficult lives of primary and secondary school teachers, believing that the situation should be weighed reasonably and a solution should be found quickly. All of these letters have been forwarded by this newspaper to the education authorities for consideration in a rational solution. In recent days, readers' letters have expressed great admiration for the willingness of some private school authorities and teachers to endure hardships rather than increase tuition for students and their families, and have proposed launching a movement to donate money to honor teachers, expressing their sympathy and respect through practical action. This newspaper has always regarded "helping education" as one of its important services. Fundraising for honoring teachers can enable teachers to teach with peace of mind and prevent students' studies from being affected. Therefore, this newspaper is willing to serve readers' requests. From today, this newspaper's social service department will collect donations to honor teachers. We also ask people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about education to generously donate and enthusiastically support this cause!

### Rush to Exchange Gold and Silver Becomes More Severe Day by Day: Branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank to Handle Exchanges Starting Next Week

[Our Report] The deposit exchange business is still limited to the head offices of the four banks of China. The crowding situation is becoming more and more severe day by day. However, according to the person in charge of the Operations Bureau of the Central Bank yesterday, the state-owned banks had already notified the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China to quickly order their branches in this city to handle exchange business at the same time. However, due to the cumbersome procedures, there have been delays. After active preparation, starting next week, the branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China in this city will start handling exchange business at roughly the same time, which should improve the current crowding situation. Furthermore, it has been rumored that Minister of Finance Xu Cai had gathered the persons in charge of the Operations Bureau of the state-owned banks to discuss improving the exchange method during his recent visit to Shanghai. He also firmly denied this, saying that he had not yet met with Minister Xu after his arrival in Shanghai, and that the exchange business had not changed, and that the original unlimited exchange method was still in place. He hoped that people from all walks of life would not easily believe rumors.

Furthermore, the crowding situation at the entrances of the four banks has become increasingly serious in recent days. Among the crowds of people rushing to exchange money, there are more people in uniform. The lines for exchanging silver dollars are even more intense than the lines for gold. Taking the Central Bank as an example, an average of about 1,500 citizens can be accepted for exchange each day, and those exchanging silver dollars account for about 1,000 of them.

### Wang Zaoshi and Friend Settle Dispute: Quarrel Arises Over Residence

Wang Zaoshi, who was famous in Shanghai before the Anti-Japanese War as one of the "Seven Gentlemen," previously used the name "Jiangxi Ji'an Front Daily" to publish a Shanghai edition. He hired Xu Yiliping as the director of the Shanghai office's preparatory office. Xu worked hard to apply for and obtain four houses, one of which, located at 21 Yuxin Lane, Disixian Road, was designated for Xu and other colleagues from the Front Daily to live in. This summer, Liu Jiufeng, one of the founders of the newspaper, came to Shanghai from Jiangxi. Wang invited him to live on the third floor of the house. Half a month ago, Wang suddenly sold the third floor to a person named Wu Baiqi and wanted to occupy the second floor where Xu lived. Liu and Xu did not agree and Wang forcibly moved in, causing a dispute. Liu and Xu argued that Wang had no right to lend the house to someone who was not related to the Front Daily without authorization and firmly refused to yield. Friends of both sides heard the news and repeatedly mediated the dispute, but it has not been resolved and remains at a standstill.

### Fire Near Central Market: Thirteen Wooden Houses Destroyed

### Huili Defeats Taikang by a Large Margin: Jianle Crushes Chunmao

Results of Yesterday's Chenyou Cup

In the Chenyou Cup basketball tournament, two games were played in Group A. Last night, Chunmao fought hard but was eventually defeated by Jianle. The absence of Chunmao's main players, Liu Fushan and Li Xianzheng, greatly affected the team's strength. The first half was closely contested, ending in a 27-27 tie. In the second half, Chunmao lacked stamina and fell behind, resulting in a final score of 65-48.

The match between Huili and Taikang was a one-sided affair due to the disparity in strength. Huili won by a landslide, defeating Taikang 68-29. In the first half, Huili scored 26 points, while Taikang only scored 8 points. Huili's Tian Fuhai scored 27 points, while Wang Yongfang scored 17 points. One game was played in Group B last night, with Zhaoshang forfeiting to Zhixin.

### Plot to Snatch Sailor's Job: Heartless Nephew Murders Uncle

[Our Report] Hu Shandao, 38 years old, from Dinghai, came to Shanghai from his hometown last month to look for business, temporarily staying at the home of his nephew, Hu Qingtang, at No. 37 Guangxing Wharf in Yangshupu. He borrowed a total of 80 yuan and 8 sheng of rice from Qingtang. On the 29th of last month, he was introduced by a friend to work as a sailor on the foreign ship "Glen Hall" at the Hongyinyi Wharf in Pudong. After only four days, his salary had not yet been paid. His nephew, Qingtang, thought that since his uncle had a job, he should quickly return the borrowed money, so he was quite unhappy. He then had a malicious thought: to harm his uncle and seize the sailor's job on the ship. One day in the evening, Qingtang went to the ship in Pudong to meet Shandao, falsely claiming that the cotton quilt had been left at home and could be brought on board to ward off the cold. Shandao did not suspect anything and, after finishing work at 8:00 PM, returned to Shanghai together. When they arrived at a desolate and dark place in Zhoujiawan, Yangshupu, Qingtang took advantage of his uncle's unpreparedness, took out a sharp blade from his sleeve, and slashed at his head six times. Fortunately, he had a felt hat covering his head, and he only suffered three minor cuts. After being injured, Shandao ran away and jumped into the river, calling for help. Zhou Gensheng and Dong Fugen, two guards from the nearby fields, heard the cries and rushed over. They found Hu Shandao hiding in the river and managed to rescue him. Shortly after, the murderer, Hu Qingtang, also arrived in a panic and was apprehended and sent to the Xinshijie Police Station for questioning. The injured Hu Shandao was escorted to the Hudong Hospital for treatment by the investigating officer.

### Increased Export Settlement Last Month: Totaling Over US$20 Million

[Our Report] According to sources from the Export Control Commission, the total national export settlement for last month reached US$20,029,000. This figure represents a significant increase compared to the past, largely due to the improved export volume following the implementation of the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate.

Export settlement for the first week of November was only US$4,620,000, decreasing to US$2,860,000 in the second week, increasing to US$6,000,000 in the third week, and rising to US$6,500,000 in the fourth week. However, private sector exports saw limited growth, averaging US$1,700,000 in the first two weeks and increasing to US$1,900,000 after the implementation of the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate, a marginal increase. Government exports amounted to US$1,900,000 in the first week, US$1,200,000 in the second week, increasing to US$4,130,000 in the third week, and rising to US$4,500,000 in the fourth week. In terms of growth rate, government exports significantly outpaced private sector exports. For the entire month, government export settlements totaled US$12,770,000, accounting for 64% of total exports. Private sector exports amounted to US$7,230,000, accounting for 36% of total exports. Government exports only include cotton yarn, cloth, frozen eggs, mineral sands, and sugar. Exports from the China Trust Bureau and other state-owned companies are not included.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Rise

Yesterday, the market for Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates was buoyant. Opening at 29.5 yuan, strong buying interest from importers drove the price straight up, closing firm at a high of 32 yuan. General observation suggests that this was due to positive news stimulating the market, as reported improvements in the war situation. Many importers currently hold import permits, and if positive news continues to emerge from the front lines, market prices may rise again today. Additionally, the Central Bank raised its listed exchange rate for remittances from overseas Chinese to 36 yuan yesterday.

### Tight Credit Eases Slightly, Cash Also Becomes More Plentiful

The tight credit situation has eased slightly, with the overnight interest rate in the market dropping to 30 yuan per thousand, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.9 yuan. The issuance of five denominations of new gold yuan notes by the Central Bank has also slightly eased the cash shortage. It is reported that foreign banks have notified their correspondent banks and firms to temporarily settle accounts, making borrowing more difficult and leading to a reduction in credit lines for their customers.

### Rice Market Stabilizes After Announcement of Household Rice Prices

Nanshi Market Rice Prices Continue to Fall

Rice prices continue to fall in the Nanshi market, while prices in the Beishi market have stabilized. The announcement of household rice prices, which are lower than market prices, has calmed the public. Prices in the producing areas have firmed up, and with credit loosening, sellers are less willing to sell. Premium japonica and thin indica rice were priced at the same level as the previous day, at 350 yuan. Early rice and indica rice, selling well due to their lower prices, rose by 5 to 10 yuan. In the Nanshi market, the bankruptcy of a major rice merchant led sellers to prefer selling to reliable firms, limiting the number of buyers and causing market nervousness. Prices fell by 30 to 40 yuan in the morning session, recovering slightly at the close but still down by 20 to 30 yuan, with premium japonica trading at 340 yuan. Total arrivals in the North and South markets yesterday amounted to 10,567 shi.

Flour: Market trends have turned upward, opening steadily and then rising as actual sales picked up, with the Zhongshi market seeing gains. Old military flour opened at 107 yuan and closed at 115 yuan, a rise of 7 yuan.

Grains: The situation remains weak, but the decline was not as significant as the previous day. Output of yellow soybeans decreased, and broad beans fell by 5 yuan.

Edible Oil: Prices are stable. Oil mills are opening in large numbers, and trading is brisk. Refined soybean oil is generally priced at 620 yuan, and rapeseed oil at 510 yuan, with a stable trend.

### Sugar Market Rises Slightly

Yesterday's sugar market softened initially but then stabilized, with prices rising slightly across the board. However, due to market apathy, sellers were reluctant to trade, and scattered retail transactions were limited. Grade 45 refined white sugar opened at 320 yuan, with sporadic small purchases. Market sentiment improved slightly, and prices rose by 20 yuan. With continuous declines in recent days and reduced supply from Taiwan Sugar, buyers showed slightly more interest in medium and coarse sugar, and prices also rose slightly. Local sugar, Zhang Diaoqing, and others had ample supply from merchant groups, and prices were heavily discounted, causing market prices to fall.

### Yarn Prices Firm, Cotton Cloth Slightly Improved

Yesterday's yarn market saw slightly firmer prices as market sentiment gradually stabilized. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at a high of 1,300 yuan, but as factory supply was ample, the price fell back to close at 10,600 yuan, up 400 yuan from the previous day. Gold City closed at 10,400 yuan, a gain of 400 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn traded at 9,100 yuan, a rise of 300 yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn rose sharply to 8,700 yuan at one point, before closing at 8,000 yuan, a gain of 1,000 yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns also saw gains ranging from 400 to 1,000 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market showed slight improvement, with a healthier trend and quieter market conditions. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially fell, with transactions at 348 yuan, but as buyers showed strong demand, prices rose to 380 yuan before weakening at the afternoon close to 370 yuan, only 5 yuan higher than the previous day. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge saw brisk trading, rising by 10 yuan to close at 375 yuan. Other Shilin cloth, colored cloth, printed cloth, and white plain cloth remained stable.

Woolens Weaken

The woolens and textile market remained sluggish yesterday. Tailors' sales were slow, clothing business was weak, and the number of buyers was limited. Sellers were eager to clear inventory. Zhanghua floral flannel was quoted by the factory at 240 yuan, payable by five-day check, but instant cash sales were seen at 220 yuan at the tea party, indicating a continued softening trend.

Spot Cotton Continues to Weaken

The spot cotton market has been quiet in recent days. Spinning mills showed no buying interest, and sellers, pressured by tight credit, automatically lowered prices. Hubei fine fleece and Shashi cotton reportedly saw some buying interest from purchasing associations. Zhoupu seed cotton has fallen as low as 190 yuan.

### Before and After the Fall of Shenyang (Part 1): Surviving the Jaws of Death, Witnessing the Tragedy; Providing a Serious Lesson

— Our Special Correspondent, Han Qingtao

[Report from Tianjin, 1st] The change of color in Pan Yang was a nightmare, a sudden storm that transformed the world into something different. The loss of Pan Yang was, of course, not accidental. Tracing the roots, we find that the rapid disintegration of five or six elite armies between Shenyang and Heishan was the precursor. The remaining troops defending Shenyang, recognizing the overwhelming odds, subsequently changed course, resulting in a "one-sided" situation.

Initially, the large army trapped in Shenyang launched a multi-pronged attack. Liu Yuzhang led the 52nd Army south, targeting Yingkou, and completed the mission on October 3rd. It is said that there were two purposes: one was to support the westward advance, forming a coordinated front, and the other was to open a retreat route.

The westward advance was commanded by the renowned Liao Yaoxiang, and included three armies known for their elite status: the New 1st, New 3rd, and New 6th, as well as other famous units such as the 49th and 71st. Their mission was to relieve Jinzhou and concentrate in western Liaoning, starting in late October. The advance was slow, and intelligence was poor. Entering Zhangwu and Xinlitun proved to be difficult, ultimately leading to a disastrous standstill in the Heishan, Xinmin, and Xinlitun areas.

The westward advance failed to progress, while the eastward advance could not break through the Tasha Mountain pass leading to Jinzhou. As a result, Jinzhou fell after a fierce battle, and Fan Hanjie, Director of the Northeast Suppression Headquarters Jinzhou Command and Commander-in-Chief of the Ji Re Liao Border Area, along with Zhao Junquan, Commander of the 6th Army Corps, were captured, with incalculable material losses.

The westward advance failed to achieve its mission of relieving Jinzhou. Unable to move westward or retreat to Shenyang, it hesitated and pondered. The enemy, using lightly equipped units, first intercepted the logistics of the various Nationalist armies and made the best use of light cavalry to harass and ambush, confusing and disrupting the Nationalist forces.

Liao Yaoxiang's command post was attacked, and after Liao led his troops to break through, the morale of each army division wavered. Soldiers lacked fighting spirit, officers lacked the ability to maintain discipline, and defeated soldiers fled to Shenyang, further undermining the morale of the entire Pan Yang and its people.

The enemy's main forces gradually arrived in the area west of Xinmin, cutting off a large number of officers and soldiers. A large number of division, regimental, and battalion commanders were captured or killed. Pan Yuqun, Long Tianwu, and others returned to Shenyang in great distress. Long Tianwu even fainted, declaring, "If I can gather a battalion, I will be the battalion commander. If I can gather a division, I will be the division commander, and we will start all over again!" But in reality, this was not possible.

How many troops remained in Shenyang? Two divisions of the 53rd Army, one division of the 207th Division, and the newly formed 2nd Garrison Command of the Shenyang Municipal Government. Using such meager forces to defend the vast urban area of Shenyang, as well as the Beiling, Dongta, and Yunhe airfields, seemed incredibly thin. The military authorities then ordered the 52nd Army from Yingkou in southern Liaoning to return to Shenyang, but unexpectedly, the enemy transferred a force from western Liaoning, intercepting them at Haicheng.

Shenyang lacked reinforcements from the outside and fighting spirit from within. Because the defending forces witnessed the tragedy of the collapse of five or six large armies between Xinmin and Heishan, the impact was too great, leading to wavering morale. The communists seized the opportunity to infiltrate, agitate, and sow discord. As a result, the two divisions of the 53rd Army (the army commander Zhou Fucheng wept bitterly over this, as he was trapped in the encirclement) and others had problems.

On the night of the 28th, enemy forces attacking eastern Shenyang were allowed to enter the more than ten-kilometer-long Tuanshanzi pass. Traces of the Eighth Route Army were found in Dongling and other places. The 207th Division was ordered to rush to restore the position at Tuanshanzi, but due to being held back, it was unable to succeed. At the same time, around Dawa, less than ten kilometers north of Shenyang, the "Eighth Route Army" also attacked, and the Beiling Airfield was the first to be threatened by enemy artillery fire.

Wei Lihuang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Suppression, was hesitant and indecisive in his command and deployment during the Liaoxi Campaign. In the midst of the tension in Shenyang, he panicked and failed to make a planned arrangement. The only hope he pinned on, the 52nd Army, could not return from Yingkou. In the end, everything was reduced to a dream.

### Zhenhai Woman Wu Xiangzhu Hangs Herself

[Report from Zhenhai, 2nd] Wu Mengxing, a gentry merchant in Qingshi, Jiasui Township, Zhenhai County, owns over one hundred acres of farmland. However, due to the large number of orphans and close relatives in his clan who rely on his support, he has fallen into even greater financial difficulties this year. Wu himself sent his eldest daughter, Wu Xiangzhu (28 years old, a university graduate), back to his hometown the other day to handle rental matters in order to support his relatives in the countryside. However, for more than a month, no rent was collected, and household expenses were exhausted. Xiangzhu, deeply affected by this, hanged herself in the morning at 3 a.m. on November 30th. The fact that she had land but no rent to collect, leading to this tragedy, is truly lamentable. Furthermore: Since the tragic suicide of Wu Xiangzhu due to the inability to collect rent, over one hundred landlords, large and small (mostly women), dispatched ten representatives to the county government at 9 a.m. on the 2nd to petition for rent collection. The county government's relevant department received them and instructed them to wait for the government to resolve the issue legally.

### Communism in China (4) September 1948 Compiled by the Institute of Foreign Relations

— Special Translation by the Newspaper Translation Department

Second, he believes that the merged two-stage revolution can be jointly promoted by all progressive classes, except for the imperialist, feudal, and bureaucratic elements within the Kuomintang. This will be "a new type of revolution, completely or partially led by the proletariat. The first stage of the revolution aims to establish a new democratic society, a new political system of joint dictatorship by all revolutionary classes."

Third, Mao advocates temporarily adopting moderate socialism. The economic system of "New Democracy" includes the nationalization of banks, industries, and commercial institutions because these institutions are "large in scale and not suitable for individual operation." Poor peasants without land can still obtain appropriate land from the confiscated estates of large landowners. Other private property and enterprises, if not excessively large, can mostly continue to be held. Therefore, complete socialization is not immediately attempted because "socialism is impossible to implement before the current revolutionary tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism have been completed."

Fourth, according to Mao's view, this stage of joint dictatorship and moderate socialism will be in complete agreement with Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. The united political system will adopt a combative approach to implement the Three Principles of the People. Socialism can only go beyond the boundaries of the Three Principles of the People in the second stage of the new revolution, but when this stage will arrive is not indicated.

Fifth, the Chinese people under the new revolutionary system will adhere to a policy of "accepting the hand of friendship from the socialist country of the Soviet Union and the international proletariat."

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has already taken practical action regarding the united front of all classes advocated by Mao Zedong. When the CCP convened its Seventh National Congress in Yan'an in early 1945, it demanded that the National Government abandon one-party rule and realize a democratic government, that is, organize a coalition cabinet including representatives from all parties (including the Communist Party). After multiple negotiations with the National Government, efforts to organize a coalition cabinet with the participation of the Communist Party ultimately failed because the Communist Party was unwilling to accept conditions that would hinder its hope of seizing all political power. However, although the political goal of New Democracy could not be achieved, the CCP still preserved the Chinese Communist Party's political方針和宣傳基礎。

Generally, people's explanations of "New Democracy" are roughly as follows:

The CCP has learned many lessons from experience. They have changed their original intentions and are no longer as revolutionary as before. They are striving for reform work as we see it. They are too realistic and unwilling to continue their revolutionary efforts too far from their goals. They talk glibly about revolution, but the revolution they are now pursuing is a slow-paced effort to unite with other progressive elements to promote it through reform.

They are loyal allies of anyone who opposes conservatism and advocates democracy in any "new policy." They are prepared and willing to act in a regulated manner, delaying their revolutionary work to engage in reform work. If we "free people" can get their help to make our reform work truly appropriate, then we may be able to postpone their revolution forever and make our more optimistic hopes for peaceful reform a reality. Secondly, when they use the term "democracy," the meaning they refer to is the same as what we refer to.

Furthermore, communism varies according to the national conditions of each country. The CCP are moderate rural reformers, so even if the above does not apply to the general Communist Party, it can still apply to the Chinese Communist Party. The above is a moderate view of Mao Zedong's "New Democracy" held by some people. Now let's talk about how a well-trained communist party member views Mao's "New Democracy":

Mao discovered a brilliant way to split the opposition. He tries his best to absorb the support of non-communists to help the Communist Party complete its mission, while isolating a small number of extreme anti-communist elements. He makes the most of the opportunists between communism and various progressive reform movements.

He reconciles the old theories advocated by Marx and Engels that the revolution must have two stages, one against feudalism and one against capitalism, with the theory of "permanent revolution" that combines the two revolutions into one. He generalizes Lenin's achievements in merging the two stages of revolution, making it applicable not only to the Soviet Union, but also to China or any other country. In order to merge the two stages of revolution, the concept of uniting all classes must be instilled into the past party theory of one-party dictatorship as the most effective tool for transitioning to complete Communist Party rule.

At the same time, Mao still retains the principle of "proletarian dictatorship" in the revolutionary united front. In this front, the proletariat still occupies the main position until the time when the proletarian dictatorship can be implemented.

When discussing economic policies, Mao drew on the main points of the New Economic Policy adopted by Lenin in 1921. He admitted that in order to develop the country, some private enterprises must be allowed to continue to exist, just as Lenin admitted in 1921. However, he rearranged the order and placed the merger of the New Economic Policy with capitalist development before the socialist revolution and the proletarian dictatorship. At the same time, he advanced the initial stage of collectivization simultaneously with the development of capitalism, making the transition smooth and accelerated.

Mao further advanced Lenin's theory that the Communist Party should participate in non-communist parties. Lenin only said that the Communist Party should not avoid this if it is possible to obtain seats in parliament. Mao further pointed out that the Communist Party's participation in the coalition cabinet does not rely on the strength of votes, but on the sincere cooperation of both parties. This can maximize the Communist Party's power in the government, while minimizing the Communist Party's responsibility to the country.

The Communist Party's view of "New Democracy" has been described above. What is our impression of it? The following views seem worth mentioning:

First, it is the most important communist party work published outside the Soviet Union since the Russian Revolution.

Second, since 1848, no contribution to communist ideology in Communist Party literature has been greater than this.

Third, its deceptive effect is as noteworthy as its orthodox communist ideology.

Fourth, it more clearly shows that communism has no real sympathy for democratic constitutionalism.

Fifth, it thoroughly shows that the Communist Party's economic and political analysis is helpful for the seizure of power, and strengthens the trend of gradually deviating from Marxist theory.

Sixth, it does not emphasize violent revolution, because it has a way to delay the violent revolution until after seizing dictatorial power.

Seventh, it has at least caused a costly mistake in American policy.

Eighth, the era when this theory was most beneficial to the Communist Party has passed, but as long as the Communist Party's hope for world revolution exists, its contribution to communist theory and strategy will continue to maintain its importance.

### Second Civil War 甲 Soviet Intervention

The Soviet Union joined the Far Eastern War on August 9, 1945, the day after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, one week before the end of the war. Soviet troops marched straight into Northeast China and effortlessly occupied the largest coal-producing and industrial region in Asia outside of Siberia and Japan. They also accepted the surrender of the Japanese army in the Northeast.

At that time, it was agreed that the Soviet Union should transfer the administrative power of the Northeast to the National Government army, and it was also agreed that the Soviet Union could restore some of its rights and property in the Far East that had been abandoned in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 or later. In other words, the Soviet Union could recover the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the railway rights in the Northeast. However, it was not agreed that the weapons surrendered by the Japanese army should not be transferred to the hands of the CCP, nor was it agreed that the Soviet Union should not demand the dismantling of the industrial equipment in the Northeast under the pretext of war booty. As a result, the Soviet Union did both of the above, and it has been occupying Dalian and Lushun until now.

On August 14, 1945, the Soviet Union and China signed a 30-year Treaty of Friendship, and the articles were announced on August 26, the day Mao Zedong arrived in Chongqing to discuss unification issues with Chairman Chiang. This revealed a glimmer of "peace."

The National Army and the Communist Army began to compete for the weapons, land, and industries surrendered by the Japanese army in North China. This competition on the Communist Party's side went far against the order issued by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, MacArthur, that all Japanese surrenders should be accepted by the central government authorities.

For decades, Dalian Port and the South Manchuria Railway have always been the main passages between mainland China and the Northeast. After the Chinese government was rejected from "jointly using" Dalian Port, all troop movements had to take a roundabout and difficult land route through Shanhaiguan or use unsuitable auxiliary seaports. When the Japanese army surrendered, almost all of the National Government's troops were in the southwest. The National Army's movement to the Northeast was first hindered by the destruction of the railway south of the Yangtze River by the Japanese army. In addition, after the Japanese surrender, the Communist Army destroyed many railway lines north of the Yangtze River. Because of this initial situation and the actions of the CCP and the Soviet Union, the time for the National Army to reach the Northeast was delayed.

On November 2, the Soviet Union announced that it would begin to withdraw its troops from the Northeast, and the Chinese government was not yet prepared to follow up and move in. The National Army, which moved into the Northeast by sea, discovered that the Communist Army had occupied important strongholds. Other troops marching by land had to compete for Shanhaiguan, an important stronghold on the railway line from mainland China to outside the customs. As a result, the second civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists quickly broke out again. In November 1945, battles occurred widely wherever the two armies came into contact.

The war progressed in a complex and tragic manner. The CCP was no longer weak. The National Army dimly recovered Yan'an and occupied several key cities and railway lines, but as the Communist Army lost one area, it quickly captured another.

The way the war was conducted was very interesting, but this is not our concern here. The question is: How did Soviet intervention in the Far East affect the balance of power of the Chinese army? Although the answer cannot be accurate, it may be very simple. Before the end of World War II, the strength of the Chinese Red Army was about 500,000 people, and their weapons were not very sufficient. Now their strength is three times what it was before, and their weapons are more than abundant.

The CCP obtained the Japanese army's weapons and other materials not through open or formal transfers, but through secret private transactions. Therefore, although they did not completely control the Northeast, they had already paralyzed it. They occupied the industrial assets of the Northeast, which, although only remnants, were far better than any assets they had previously acquired. They did not make full use of the industries there, but the areas under the jurisdiction of the National Government, which urgently needed these industries, could not get their hands on them at all.

The Chinese civil war has now broken out again, but the situation is completely different from when the civil war ended. The balance of power between the Nationalists and the Communists has changed drastically. In 1937, the CCP's victory was to fight for survival. Now, it may be the Kuomintang's victory. Soviet intervention in the Far East was the biggest factor in this change. (To be continued)
