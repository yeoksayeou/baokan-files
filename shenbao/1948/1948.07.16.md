### Principles for the Utilization of US Aid Determined: Balancing Revenue and Expenditure, Conserving Foreign Exchange, and Promoting Production; 70,000 Bales of Cotton En Route to China

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee held its first meeting at 3 PM on the 15th, presided over by concurrent Chairman Weng Wenhao, with Vice Chairman Yu Hongjun in attendance. Committee members Yu Dawei, Wang Yunwu, Wang Shijie, Yan Jiagan, and Secretary-General Shen Xirui, along with the heads of various departments of the US Aid Utilization Committee and more than ten others, engaged in a four-hour discussion. Concrete decisions were made regarding the principles for utilizing US aid and its allocation. There are three principles for utilizing US aid: (1) Stabilizing the economy and balancing revenue and expenditure, (2) Conserving the consumption of foreign exchange reserves, and (3) Promoting the development of domestic agricultural and industrial production. Based on the first principle, US aid materials will be sold as much as possible in the future to contract currency. Based on the second principle, the import of US aid materials will replace regular imports. Based on the third principle, US$60 million will be drawn from US aid to engage in permanent and fundamental construction. Regarding the allocation of US aid, out of the US$400 million, US$125 million is for military assistance. The total amount of economic assistance is US$275 million, of which US$60 million is earmarked for economic construction (subject to final decision after the Steelman report is investigated), US$70 million for food, US$70 million for cotton, US$50 million for oil, US$13.8 million for fertilizer, US$10 million for industrial parts, and US$1.2 million for administrative expenses. The period for the flow of this US aid is one year, from April 3 of this year to April 2 of next year, divided into four phases. The first phase is from April to June, with the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation having already advanced US$50 million, of which the economic portion is US$36.5 million, allocated as US$13.5 million for food, US$13 million for cotton, US$8 million for oil, US$1.5 million for fertilizer, and US$0.5 million for investigation expenses. As of the 13th of this month, 40,821 tons of rice and 8,939 tons of flour have been shipped (all purchased and shipped from Southeast Asia), and approximately 70,000 bales of cotton are en route to China. Oil and fertilizer will also be shipped in succession. The disbursement figures for the second phase (including July, August, and September of this year) were also preliminarily decided at the meeting on the 15th, with a total of US$61.5 million to be disbursed in the second phase, with cotton receiving the largest allocation. An estimated 180,000 bales of cotton can be obtained.

Regarding the utilization of various grain materials, the meeting discussed it for a long time and decided to establish a subcommittee for each item to study the details and technical issues of utilization. The subcommittees are composed of representatives from relevant ministries and commissions. It has been decided that food will be used for distribution and sale, cotton will be extracted for yarn and cloth exports before re-importing raw cotton, and the utilization of oil and fertilizer will also be studied.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] At the first meeting of the US Aid Utilization Committee on the 15th, Yan Jiagan and Shen Xirui both attended and reported. Yan reported on the process of accompanying Steelman on an investigation in South China, and Shen Xirui reported on the work of the Secretariat. According to Shen, the Secretariat has only 15 staff members, all transferred from relevant agencies.

### President Cables to Encourage Governors and Mayors of Provinces and Cities to Eliminate Old Habits, Go Deep into the Grassroots, Strengthen the Work of Suppressing Bandits and Quelling the Rebellion, and Strive for Effective Political Improvement; Seize the Opportunity of the Victory in Eastern Henan to Redouble Efforts

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] President Chiang Kai-shek recently cabled to the chairmen and mayors of the provincial and municipal governments, encouraging them to strengthen the work of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, seize the opportunity of the victory in eastern Henan to redouble their efforts, strive for effective political improvement, eliminate old habits, and be down-to-earth in their work. The President's original cable is recorded as follows:

To suppress bandits and quell the rebellion, we must rely on mobilizing the full strength of the people. All political measures must meet the needs of the people and form a complete force, which is enough to clear out traitors internally, so that scattered bandits have no foothold, and externally, it is enough to resist aggression, so that remnant bandits have no possibility of looting. Then the establishment of a comprehensive war system is complete, and military victory is certain. The consistent style of the Communist bandits is to deceive the masses and incite the youth as their most vicious tricks. If we only talk about force, they are ultimately just a mob, avoiding strength and attacking weakness, choosing gaps to flow and flee, purely seeking food and soldiers, expanding their evil forces, and never daring to engage in decisive battles with the National Army. Until the recent Henan campaign, the Communist bandits attempted to believe that they had been preparing for a long time and had grown strong wings, so they should be able to ask about the Central Plains. Last month, they gathered their stubborn main forces of Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, etc., with a crowd of about 300,000, taking advantage of the weakness of our Kaifeng garrison, and suddenly invaded and occupied it. When we rushed to aid and recovered it, they again gathered in the Sui County, Qi County, and Tongxu area, with long snakelike formations, entrenched in a corner, hoping to fight the National Army to the death and achieve their ambitions. However, after our land and air forces in Henan jointly swept, pincered from east and west, and fired from top to bottom, this huge and fierce bandit army collapsed within a few days, with more than 100,000 annihilated. The bandit chiefs Chen and Liu each led the remnants and fled in panic. After this battle, the Communist bandits' military force is indeed weak. It has been fully proven that they cannot compete with the National Army. It is hoped that the responsible heads of all levels of administration in all provinces and cities will seize this opportunity of military victory, redouble their efforts, and strive for effective political improvement. First of all, we should eliminate the habit of relying on hearsay, be down-to-earth, and go deep into the grassroots. All provincial government chairmen and heads of departments and divisions should personally go to each county in stages for planned inspections. Administrative supervisors and county magistrates, along with county government officials, should go to each village and township every month for targeted work supervision, providing instructions, solving problems, reporting corruption, and clarifying rewards and punishments at any time and place, so that the feelings of the upper and lower levels can be thoroughly connected, the shackles of laws and regulations can be rounded, the pain of the people can be reduced, and the efficiency of politics can be improved. Therefore, the people's attitude towards the government depends on this.

### Training Local Armed Forces Must Be Supervised at Each Level; Do Not Deceive Above and Mix Below, Perfunctorily Telling Stories

Secondly, the organization and training of provincial security regiments, county self-defense forces, and township baojia is the basic strength for provinces and counties to suppress and defend against bandits. It must be supervised at each level, and organized and arranged in accordance with regulations. Do not repeat the past practice of deceiving above and mixing below, perfunctorily telling stories. In particular, we should encourage local gentlemen, supervise retired military officers, assist the people in organizing and training, do their best to defend their homeland, use the collective force of the local area to suppress small groups of bandits, so as to prevent them from growing stronger; strengthen the organization of people's baojia, and clear out the hidden bandit parties, so as to cut off their internal support. It must be known that the people everywhere hate the Communist bandits' brutality and are enthusiastic about protecting their hometowns. If our administrative officials at all levels can personally lead, share weal and woe, and share difficulties, everyone will surely be inspired, children will be willing to serve, and elders will be happy to contribute their wealth. In recent years, in the areas controlled by bandits, all virtuous officials who have followed this principle have achieved remarkable results, which can be used as a reference.

### Fully Understand the Suffering of the People and Eliminate Extralegal Harassment

Moreover, suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion is a last resort to save the people from fire and water and defend our country. In the bandit suppression areas, due to the destruction and trampling by the Communist bandits, the people's livelihood is on the verge of despair. In safe areas, due to the needs of military supplies, the burden on the people is inevitably increased, which is undeniable. Administrative personnel at all levels should fully understand the suffering of the people, and actively eliminate any extralegal harassment so that the people can live in peace; and promote all recoverable production and production projects that can be increased, so that the people can live their lives. In particular, the rear provinces and regions should launch local wealth and cooperate in economic construction, taking from the local to benefit the local, which will be supported by people of insight.

### Whether We Can Be Pragmatic Will Be the Basis for Rewards and Punishments

These three points are all simple and easy to implement. If our administrative officials at all levels can personally practice them and carry them out, I firmly believe that local security can be ensured, the political atmosphere can be transformed within half a year, administrative efficiency can be improved significantly, and the people's potential can be developed. The more effective our politics are, the more the evil forces of the Communist bandits will be weakened. Then, with our superior national army, we can destroy the remnants of the dying bandits, and the complete elimination of the bandit scourge can be expected. In the past, when Chiang Kai-shek suppressed bandits in the areas between Hubei, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, he achieved initial success with seven parts politics and three parts military. Management, education, and defense were all in place, and the previous rules are there. Looking at the past from today, there is no difference in principle. From now on, the central government will also regard whether the administrative personnel in each province can be pragmatic and whether they have significant political achievements as the basis for rewards, punishments, and dismissals, without any leniency. It is hoped that after receiving the telegram, you will immediately report the specific outline to be implemented in detail. Chiang Kai-shek, hand-written.

One route crossed towards Suqian, and the other rushed towards Lingcheng, southeast of Suining County. The situation in that area is unclear. The attacking bandits are continuing to attack the county seat. Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, stationed in Xuzhou, has not only telegraphed Commander Sun Liangcheng to hold firm and wait for reinforcements, but has also dispatched elite troops to go south from the Longhai Railway and the Canal Line. The vanguard has crossed Shuanggou and arrived at Dawangji, cooperating with the troops of General Zhang Xuezhong of the 7th Pacification Zone to pincer attack the bandits. Also, the war situation in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is also tight.

### The New Stage of the US Election - Congratulations to President Truman on Being Elected Presidential Candidate

The US Democratic Party National Convention opened in Philadelphia on the 12th of this month and voted for presidential and vice-presidential candidates on the 14th. As of the time of this reporter's writing, it has been confirmed that President Truman and Senator Barkley have been elected as the Democratic Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates. In the moment before the vote, although the issue of black civil rights caused disputes among the representatives of the Southern states, leading to some twists and turns, President Truman won a large majority in the first vote of the Democratic Party National Convention and was elected as the Democratic presidential candidate, bringing the globally-watched US presidential election this winter into a new stage.

Initially, most of the Democratic Party favored the meritorious General Eisenhower, believing that only Eisenhower's candidacy could unite the diverse opinions within the party. However, Eisenhower consistently opposed "military involvement in politics" and repeatedly and firmly stated that he was unwilling to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. It was not until the eve of the Democratic Party National Convention that Florida Senator Pepper accepted the "draft" and came out to compete with Truman for the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Although Pepper was a figure from the New Deal faction of the late President Roosevelt, he himself said, "Competing with Truman is not a gesture, but a struggle, and I believe it will be successful." However, President Truman, during World War II, inherited the legacy of the late President Roosevelt and implemented the Democratic Party's established platform, finally defeating Nazi Germany and Japan. His contributions to the United States and the world are indelible in the hearts of the American people. In any case, Truman was ultimately more trusted by people inside and outside the party than Pepper. Therefore, in the end, Pepper automatically withdrew, creating a situation of a single contender. Thus, the vote on the evening of the 14th was just a formality.

However, the focus of the US election issue today is not President Truman's election as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, but whether President Truman can defeat the Republican Party's presidential candidate Dewey and win in the general election in November. This question is not appropriate to speculate on at this time, but from our perspective, the election in November this year is not a political struggle between Truman and Dewey, but a decisive battle between the Democratic and Republican parties. As far as President Truman himself is concerned, after the death of the late President Roosevelt, he assumed the presidency as vice president. At that time, the war was in full swing, the outcome was not yet clear, and the world was still in turmoil. However, President Truman was able to remain calm and respond decisively, inheriting the legacy of the late President Roosevelt and faithfully implementing the Democratic Party's established platform, finally achieving final victory. It cannot be denied that this was President Truman's contribution to the United States and the world. As for the unpredictable changes in the international situation after the victory, which led to the current stalemate in the world, it cannot be said that it was caused solely by President Truman. Moreover, the foreign policy pursued by President Truman was also decided with the consent of the Republican Party, a policy agreed upon by both parties. However, the more urgent the world's crisis, the greater the responsibility of the United States, and the more urgent the need for the United States to have a firm and unwavering foreign policy. From this perspective, President Truman's victory is not entirely without hope. This is probably why the Democrats still support Truman as their presidential candidate.

Currently, the competition between the Democratic and Republican parties is like performing a big circus on the same stage, with both sides beating their drums especially loudly. However, the world still feels that the Republican Party held its national convention in Philadelphia in late June, which was very lively and exciting, with everyone excited, and the atmosphere was full of joy and hope. Since the Democratic Party's convention opened on the 12th, the atmosphere has been relatively dull, seeming not enthusiastic enough and not tense enough. Even during the voting, it did not break the surrounding quiet atmosphere, as if the Democratic Party, which has been in power for sixteen years, also felt somewhat tired. Comparing the two, the difference in atmosphere seems to be a slight indication of who will win and who will lose in the November election this year. Democratic Party National Convention Chairman McGrath said in his opening address on the 12th, on the one hand, he called for peace and prosperity, saying, "The Democratic Party has sixteen years of experience leading the country, is best able to avoid World War III, and can achieve domestic prosperity." On the other hand, he attacked the Republican Party as conservative and backward, saying, "The 'Republican Party-controlled' 80th Congress will be remembered forever, and its harm is far greater than its meager success, and its achievements are the most reactionary and anti-civilized in our history." At the same time, the "Roosevelt-Truman" platform drafted by Mayou also emphasized "all the glorious achievements of the Democratic Party in the past sixteen years." In the past, these pleasant words were enough to win the applause of voters. However, now when the average American hears them, they seem very indifferent and cannot arouse their strong interest. Could it be that external crises and internal disturbances have made the average American want to change their political tastes?

No one can deny that the international situation and the domestic situation in the United States after World War II have not been satisfactory in all respects. The urgency of the world crisis has on the one hand increased the responsibility of the United States to the world, and on the other hand deepened the domestic crisis in the United States. The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan have been implemented for more than a year and a half, but the result of implementing these policies has not been able to subtly eliminate the rift between the two worlds for the world. For the United States itself, there is also a growing concern about economic panic. In today's America, where people yearn for peace and prosperity, they may inevitably think about changing the government's domestic and foreign policies. In addition, there is one more point worth noting, and that is the division within the Democratic Party. The departure of Wallace from the Democratic Party to form the American Third Party in 26 states in the United States does not need to be discussed. Even ordinary party members have differing opinions on the domestic and foreign policies of the Democratic Party, which has been in power for sixteen years. For example, the Democratic Party's campaign "strategists" originally wanted to appeal to the public by emphasizing the party's special focus on domestic plans and advocating the abolition of racial discrimination, but this was opposed by Democratic Party members in the southern states. The representatives of the Southern states walked out on the spot, making the rift in the Democratic Party even deeper.

In short, after the Democratic Party's presidential candidate was decided, the US election has entered a new stage. From this, we can see a clue, that is, Truman and Barkley will compete with Dewey and Warren. The impact of the US presidential election on international politics is too great today, and its future development is even more worthy of our attention at all times.

### Resolution of the Student Assault Case in Baoding. Zhang Yinwu Apologizes to Speaker Wang.

[This newspaper's Baoding dispatch, 15th] The case of the students of Fourth Cun Middle School assaulting Speaker Wang of the Assembly has reached a preliminary resolution. Zhang Yinwu, the concurrent principal of the school, along with the military and the garrison headquarters, apologized to Speaker Wang on the 14th to prevent further escalation.

[This newspaper's Baoding dispatch, 14th] The assault on the Speaker of the Assembly in Baoding is not a student strike. The long-term cause is that Fourth Cun Middle School is located in Nanguan Park. In order to protect the scenic spot, and because the students have built a large number of defensive fortifications, and because Baoding has been besieged by bandits many times, they assisted the army in defending and fighting, resulting in the prohibition of pedestrians from passing through or visiting the park. Some local people were dissatisfied. Last year, Speaker Wang wanted to pass through, but was refused by the school's gatekeeper. Subsequently, the Assembly and the Qingyuan County Government attempted to recover the park site unsuccessfully. The school's cooperative cotton production department was also sealed off, cutting off the source of school funding and student meal expenses. Since March, students have been reducing food and studying hard, accumulating resentment towards Speaker Wang and Liu Liyuan, the magistrate of Qingyuan County. The situation is widely sympathized with by social figures, but they express regret over the students' actions this time.

### Publication of the Contents of the Soviet Response to the Three Powers. Rejection of Lifting the Berlin Blockade. Blaming the Current Crisis on the Western Allies. But Not Opposing Negotiations for a Complete Solution to the German Question.

[United Press, London, 14th] Moscow Radio broadcast tonight the Soviet response to the protests from the United States, Britain, and France, stating that the Soviet Union does not oppose negotiations on the four-power administration of Berlin, but cannot accept any preconditions. The four-power negotiations should also focus on the entire issue of German administration, not just Berlin alone. The Soviet response also criticized West Germany's issuance of new currency and the decision by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to establish a semi-autonomous West German government, considering that this policy of dividing Germany violates the four-power agreement, and the United States, Britain, and France have themselves destroyed the legal basis for their participation in the Berlin four-power joint administration. As for lifting the Berlin blockade, the Soviet response refused to comply, stating that if it were to be done, it could only be decided on its own based on the situation. If necessary, the Soviet government would also find its own ways to maintain a sufficient food supply for all residents of Berlin. In short, the Soviet government hopes that the various difficulties caused by the Berlin blockade can be eliminated as soon as possible. The Soviet Union is not responsible for the various situations that forced the implementation of the blockade; the blame lies with the governments of the United States, Britain, and France for violating the four-power agreement. The Soviet note also stated that Berlin is located in the center of the Soviet occupation zone and is actually part of the Soviet occupation zone. The claim in the notes from the United States, Britain, and France that Berlin is an international joint administration area and not part of the Soviet occupation zone is difficult to acknowledge. The Soviet blockade of Berlin is actually for economic self-defense, to prevent the old marks abolished in West Germany from flooding the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet government believes that the claim by the United States, Britain, and France that this violates various existing agreements is completely unfounded.

### Dealing with the Berlin Situation. Considering the Next Steps. Washington, London, and Paris Maintain Contact.

[Reuters, London, 15th] Prime Minister Attlee convened the entire Cabinet today for a meeting at 10 Downing Street to study the situation after the Soviet Union rejected the three-power protest against the Berlin blockade. At about the same time, Foreign Secretary Bevin separately received US Ambassador Douglas and French Ambassador Massigli to discuss the same matter. Douglas had a long-distance telephone call with Washington last night. During the Cabinet meeting, Bevin reported on the contents of the Soviet response to the protest notes from Britain, the United States, and France. The Soviet rejection has clearly made the situation worse. Related parties believe that since the path of negotiation with the Soviet Union has been effectively blocked, the Western Allies can only strengthen their airlift system to supply Berlin.

During his meeting with Bevin, Douglas likely urged Britain, based on instructions received from his government overnight, to immediately increase defense in Berlin to demonstrate the firmness of the Western powers' position. It is expected that after exchanging views, the Western powers will soon announce their next steps in dealing with the Berlin situation.

[United Press, London, 15th] Well-informed sources recently stated that the Western Allies may directly ask Stalin to lift the Berlin blockade. They said, "Stalin agreed with us in 1945 on the method of Western troops withdrawing from the area around Berlin, but Molotov broke the agreement, so it is a reasonable move to consult with the Soviet Union's final court of appeal before taking other actions." At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin told the Cabinet that the Soviet Union's blatant rejection of lifting the Berlin blockade is a challenge to the honor and prestige of the Western countries. British, American, and French officials in London, Washington, and Paris are constantly meeting, and it is expected that the three countries will quickly take counter-action against the Soviet Union's completely unsatisfactory response, or send another note to the Soviet Union threatening to submit the matter to the United Nations or the International Court of Justice for arbitration.

[Reuters, London, 14th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office recently denied the rumors that unless the Soviet Union agrees to lift the blockade of the western districts of Berlin, Britain, the United States, and France will sue the Soviet Union in the International Court of Justice. The spokesman pointed out that cases accepted by the International Court of Justice will not be heard until at least two years later.

### Three Commanders Confer on the West German Government Plan

The agreement points out that the ships handed over by Italy are not war booty, but only compensation for the losses suffered by the French Navy due to Italy's occupation of French ports in 1943. Sforza stated that this agreement is a characteristic of Franco-Italian cooperation.

### French Civil Servants' Strike Spreads to Thirty Provinces

### The United Nations Small Assembly to be Trialed for Another Year

### Protests Against the Assassination of Communist Leaders. National Strike and Riots in Italy. The Military and Police are on Alert, Resulting in Bloody Conflicts.

[United Press, Rome, 15th] The Italian Communist Party placed a total strike, without any leaks, on the country on the 15th, making the country paralyzed in order to take revenge for the assassination of the leader Togliatti.

### Public Utility Fees: Central Government Denies Subsidies; Executive Yuan Issues Six Principles for Price Adjustments

Regarding the issue of public utility price adjustments, the Municipal Council, based on the resolution of the Sixth General Assembly, had previously suggested to the Executive Yuan for reconsideration. It is now known that the Executive Yuan, after compiling opinions from other provincial and municipal councils, submitted them to relevant ministries and commissions for review. Recently, the Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 14985 to the Municipal Government, outlining six principles for handling public utility price adjustments: (1) The adjustment of public utility prices shall continue to be handled in accordance with existing relevant laws and regulations. Opinions from various levels of public opinion institutions may be used by the competent authority as important references. (2) The price calculation formula for public utilities is based on cost accounting as the basis for price adjustments. On the one hand, it aims to maintain and improve the respective public utilities. On the other hand, it also aims to restrict them from raising prices beyond reasonable limits, in order to reduce the burden on consumers. It embodies the intention of comprehensive planning and consideration. Since its implementation, it has enabled the adjustment of various public utility prices to follow a reasonable track. Since April, there has been a relatively large increase. If some of the base numbers and coefficients need to be revised due to changes in the situation, the competent authorities at all levels can submit their opinions to the central government for verification. If there are any excessively high calculations due to miscalculations, the responsible authority or local government should strictly review them separately for public and private operations, and submit them to the central competent authority for approval. (3) When local governments review the prices of various public utilities, they may reduce them based on the circumstances during times of rapid fluctuations in various indices and are temporarily not subject to the 10% restriction stipulated in Article 8 of the Implementation Guidelines for the Public Utility Price Calculation Formula. (4) Central and local competent authorities should instruct various public utility institutions to reduce redundant staff, improve work efficiency, economize on expenditures, and reduce costs. The salaries of all employees of public utilities should be handled in accordance with regulations and should not be paid extra. (5) Local governments in various regions should, together with military and political organs and public opinion institutions, assist local public utilities in preventing electricity and water theft, as well as unauthorized ticketless rides, in order to facilitate operation. (6) Currently, the national treasury is in difficulty, and it is difficult to support either direct or indirect subsidies for public utilities. Moreover, the subsidy expenses are still borne by the people. It is unfair to make the people of the whole country share the expenses for the convenience of a small number of citizens, which seems infeasible.

### Municipal Finance Faces Most Serious Stage: Income Cannot Cover Expenses, Deficit Exceeds 1 Trillion

[Report from this Newspaper] The municipal finance of this city has reached its most serious stage. It is understood that the difference between income and expenditure this month has actually reached more than 1 trillion yuan. The municipal authorities are very worried about this. According to news from the Finance Bureau: The central government ordered that the living subsidy for public school teachers and civil servants in June be temporarily increased by 50% based on the May index (420,000 times), which requires 1 trillion and 400 billion yuan. The central government has not yet decided on the employee living index for this month. It is estimated that the increase rate must be higher than in June. Even if it is calculated with an increase of 50%, the employee living subsidy that the municipal government needs to issue this month will be at least 2 trillion yuan (not including the 400 billion yuan for regular office expenses). As for the municipal treasury revenue, it was 740 billion yuan in June. This month is the season for applying for business tax, which is a low season for tax revenue. It is estimated that the maximum revenue will be around 1 trillion and 200 billion yuan. The difference between income and expenditure is too great, and the financial authorities feel overwhelmed.

### Department Store Salary Increase Plan: Can Be Implemented Starting This Month

[Report from this Newspaper] The labor dispute between the Yong'an, Xianshi, Daxin, Xinxin, and other ten major department stores in this city was not resolved after repeated mediation.

### The "Miss" on the Rickshaw is Truly Pitiful: Father Died, Mother Imprisoned, Sells Labor for a Living, Disguised as a Man for Three Years Before Being Exposed

[Report from this Newspaper] Three months ago, a female rickshaw puller was discovered in Beiping. Because of her tragic life story, it once caused a sensation in the former capital. Unexpectedly, in this chaotic and barren world, such a thing happened again. Among the tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers in this city, the Laozha Police Bureau discovered that the protagonist rickshaw puller in a very minor theft suspicion case was also a woman disguised as a man, and her tragic experience was no different from the case in the northern country.

The woman's surname is Li, and she is only 19 years old. Her father, Li Changyuan, originally opened the Ruiyuan Rice Store at No. 2 Wansheng Lane in Ximen. However, her biological mother, Lian, was deeply addicted to drugs. After her father's death, no one took charge of the store, and it eventually closed down, leading to the decline of the family. Li has an elder cousin, Li Genyuan, who learned his trade in an electrical appliance store in his youth. Because of his good management, he has opened the Fulai Electrical Appliance Store and the Electric Power Brand Overshoe Factory on Daxin Street, and is now a wealthy merchant. However, the disparity between the rich and the poor means that he does not care about the lives of his mother and daughter. Li also has an elder sister, who has been married for a long time. Due to family reasons, she is even less able to provide financial assistance to her mother and sister. In her youth, Li received three years of education at Yixin Primary School on Malang Road. Coupled with her stubborn personality, she thought that there was no way to rely on others and had to earn a living on her own. After many requests, she achieved little success. As her old mother's drug addiction deepened and she exhausted all her resources, she resolutely changed her name to "Li Yi," abandoned her hairpin, and stepped onto a rickshaw in the vast sea of people.

Li's rickshaw pulling life began more than 34 years ago. Initially, she rented an unlicensed rickshaw from the Xiaosonglin Rickshaw Shop on Xieqiao in Nanshi. She ran day and night, barely making enough to support herself and her mother. Unexpectedly, last winter, her mother was suddenly found guilty of drug abuse and sentenced to seven months in prison. Li became an orphan. At this time, rickshaws were being strictly inspected, and the rickshaw shop, due to regulations, refused to rent to her. Li was hit hard by this. Coupled with two years of hard work, she felt exhausted and despaired. Afterwards, she wandered for more than a month. In her hesitation, she learned that the Ningbo brothel in the Shenzhou Hotel was doing well, and rickshaws were frequently transporting people to and fro. She then had the idea of returning to her old profession. After asking the rickshaw pullers in front of Shenzhou, she wept and recounted her life story. The rickshaw pullers sympathized with her and decided that if any of them needed to rest, they would take turns lending their rickshaw and uniform to Li. Her employment problem was thus solved. After a few months, the people in the brothel and the nearby Fourth Road all knew about this and sympathized with her. Every time they rode in her rickshaw, they would give her generous tips and give her the name "Luo Ming." Currently, the name "Luo Ming" is well-known in the vicinity of Shenzhou Hotel.

Li is physically strong, with a wide elastic band tied around her chest. Her hair is very short. She often wears Hong Kong shirts, shorts, and sneakers, so her appearance is not like that of a young girl. She said that in the two years before entering Shenzhou, she served hundreds of passengers, but no one could tell that she was a woman. At night, she had no fixed accommodation and either slept on her rickshaw or lived in a small vegetable market. She was exposed to the wind and dew all year round, and her face became even more haggard. Last night, she leaned against her temporarily borrowed black-plated rickshaw No. 5830, recounting her three years of service and explaining that the night before, because the repairman Li Zhishan encouraged the customer "A Long" to accuse her of stealing the rickshaw tire, she was taken to the Laozha Police Bureau. However, after questioning and clarifying that she was not involved, she was released, and her disguise as a man was exposed. She finally told reporters that she was unwilling to degenerate and was determined to continue to exchange her labor for a living, which was truly moving.

### Representatives of Various Dyeing and Weaving Unions Went to the General Labor Union Yesterday to Petition: Requesting Salaries Based on the Current Month's Index; Social Affairs Bureau Advises Labor and Management to Negotiate on Their Own

[Report from this Newspaper] Workers in the city's machine dyeing and weaving industry have been giving salaries by various factories, mostly half a month after the date of index publication, or even using the previous month's index, affecting workers' livelihoods. The labor union had negotiated with the factories in vain. Furthermore, some of the measures in the wage payment guidelines discussed at the Labor-Management Evaluation Meeting the day before were quite unfavorable, causing panic. Yesterday, more than 30 responsible persons and chairpersons from dyeing and weaving unions such as Dagong, Guangzhong, Yumin, Yizhong, Renfeng, Yuxin, Yida, and Xinguang went to the General Labor Union yesterday afternoon to petition. Ge Xinbo, the general secretary of the union, received them, and then Shui Xiangyun, the chairman of the union, convened a meeting to talk to everyone. The workers proposed two requests: (1) Supplement the June salary according to the 710,000 times index; (2) In the future, salaries should be calculated monthly according to the current month's index. Shui advised the representatives to wait for a legal solution.

At 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management representatives from the dyeing and weaving industry. Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department, attempted to mediate. The employer representatives expressed their agreement in principle to the workers' demands, but because the business conditions of each factory were different, some manufacturers would inevitably encounter difficulties if uniform salary payment methods were established. After Shen's persuasion, labor and management were first asked to find solutions on their own based on the circumstances of each factory.

### Female Tourist in Guling Attempts Suicide: Husband Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Enduring All Kinds of Complaints; Daughter-in-Law of Ding Guitang Jumps Off Building and is Rescued

[Report from our Guling Office on the 15th] The daughter-in-law of Ding Guitang, the Chief Inspector of the Customs, came to Guling on the 15th from Shanghai to recuperate. She was staying at Hu Jinfang Hotel. Her wife, Ms. Qu, brought her children and a servant to take care of her. Ding's mountain climbing was strenuous, causing him to vomit blood for several days. Qu took care of him day and night, enduring all kinds of hardships. She was also very worried about her husband's illness. Recently, she ran out of funds and sent several telegrams to Shanghai for help, but had not received any money by the 15th. Qu looked very pale when she went to the Shanghai Bank to inquire about it at about 2 p.m. After returning, she had a quarrel with her husband over the meal problem, and the sound reached outside. This 27-year-old young woman was resentful and wanted to die. She climbed out of the window and jumped from the third floor. Ding saw Qu climbing out of the window and did not know what her purpose was, and was unable to stop her due to his serious illness. Qu landed on her buttocks first, so the external injuries were not serious. At that time, she was moaning and groaning on the ground. A passerby saw her and notified the hotel owner, who came to help her. After Qu recovered slightly, she said to those who comforted her: "The sooner I die, the better." One can imagine the grief in her heart. When this reporter visited her husband, he said: It was just a minor quarrel, and he did not expect her to commit suicide so quickly. Ding's lung disease is currently being treated daily by the German doctor Ma Da Shi. According to Dr. Lu, the attending physician, Qu's injuries are only a dislocation of the left wrist, a sprained left ankle, and a hematoma in the waist, which seems to be a fracture of the lower end of the spine. It is still difficult to say that there is no danger within three or two days. Lu has telegraphed Meng Xiankai, a bone specialist in Nanchang and president of Jiangxi Medical College, to come to Guling for diagnosis and treatment.

### Magician's Son Instigated to Steal

[Report from this Newspaper] The magician Deng Guoqing lives at No. 14, Lane 58, Xizang South Road. His son, Yugen, is only eleven years old and has a cousin, Chang Chenping, who lives in the same house. At about 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, Chang was bathing in the room. After taking a bath and leaving the room, she found that a 14K women's gold watch placed on her dressing table was missing. She questioned Yugen, who admitted that he had sold it to Lin Yuqiang, a Fujianese (nickname Xiao Guangdong), for 400,000 yuan. Chang reported it to the Laozha Police Sub-Bureau, which sent officers to investigate. At about 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Lin was arrested at the Daxin Company Amusement Park and taken to the bureau, where he confessed without denial. Yugen was also summoned to the bureau for confrontation. Due to jurisdiction issues, the two were sent to the Songshan Sub-Bureau. Chang did not want to pursue the matter because Yugen was a relative and still a minor. However, she accused Lin Yuqiang of instigating theft and planned to transfer him to the District Attorney's Office for investigation.

### Zhejiang Industrial Bank Continues Hunger Strike: Management and Employees' Negotiation Fails to Reach Agreement

[Report from this Newspaper] Employees of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank continued their hunger strike yesterday. The employees requested a subsidy of 3.5 shi of rice per person per month. The bank management did not agree to this. At 1 p.m. yesterday, the bank held an emergency board meeting and resolved to provide a temporary subsidy of 15 million to 25 million yuan per person. The employees felt that this was far from their request and said that they could not accept it. Although the bank experienced a hunger strike yesterday, the order was very good and work continued as usual. If it is not resolved today, the hunger strike will continue.

### Shanghai Telephone Company Holds First Shareholders' Meeting Since the War: Vice President Reports on Business; 10,000 New Lines Will Be Added Soon

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Telephone Company held its first shareholders' meeting since the war yesterday at its office on Jiangxi Road. Shareholders representing more than 70% of the company's total ordinary shares attended. The meeting elected the next board of directors: Ou Shaofu, Fei Lanli, Franklin, Furlong, Li Ming, Lang Haoshi, Rem, Schderle, and Thomas. Colonel Ou Shaofu, the current Chief Vice President, reported on the company's general situation, stating: The company's assets were severely damaged during the war. After the war, thanks to its affiliation with International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, it was able to obtain the most essential parts and materials for emergency repairs and reconstruction. Over the past two years, 6 million feet of wire have been replaced, and more than 50,000 telephones have been repaired or replaced. The equipment in each telephone bureau has also been completely inspected, and some parts have been reassembled and replaced. However, most of the equipment is still in a precarious state and will not be safe until more parts and equipment can be purchased and the permanent repair project is completed. From the time the company recovered its assets on September 19, 1945, to May 31, 1948, 3,450 new telephones were installed. As of that date, the total number of telephones in service was 96,098, which could not meet user demand. Furthermore, the sharp increase in call volume has greatly affected the service situation. For example, the average daily call volume in October 1945 was 477,800 calls, while in June 1948 it was 712,200 calls, far exceeding the capacity of the company's existing equipment. The inevitable results are slow dial tones and generally substandard service. This situation will continue until sufficient foreign exchange allocation is available to purchase new equipment. The only temporary remedy is for users to conserve telephone usage. Last year, the company ordered automatic equipment and materials to add 10,000 telephone lines from abroad. Most of them have now arrived in Shanghai and will be gradually installed and put into service from the end of this year throughout next year. However, the foreign exchange allocation required to maintain the company's reconstruction and expansion is still insufficient. If it wants to restore its past high efficiency and meet the current and future service needs, the authorities must greatly increase the company's foreign exchange allocation. In addition, telephone rates should also be reasonably adjusted to provide a full profit on investment as stipulated in the franchise agreement. The company had a net loss of US$516,872 in 1945, a net profit of US$294,459 in 1946, and a net loss of US$375,808 in 1947. Until these two points are reached, the company will continue to exercise an extremely prudent policy.

### Holding a Fair Distribution of Rice; What is a Poor Person? The Duty of the Neighborhood Chief; Special Explanation from the People's Food Allocation Committee

[Our Newspaper's Report] The People's Food Allocation Committee, to ensure that all neighborhood chiefs can easily determine the target population when conducting surveys of poor people, to avoid misunderstandings of the regulations, resulting in inconsistencies across districts, and causing unfair phenomena, specially provides a detailed explanation of Article 2 of the originally promulgated "Shanghai Municipality Trial Implementation Measures for Rice Distribution to Poor People," regarding the definition of poor people under these measures: Those who meet one of the following conditions and have completed household registration procedures according to law before the end of June of the 37th year are considered poor people under these measures and are eligible to receive a rice distribution certificate to purchase subsidized rice. However, those who did not register their household before the end of June, and mobile poor people without household registration, even if they meet one of the following conditions, are not included in the survey and are not subject to the following two measures:

1.  If all members of a household have no fixed or mobile occupation and have no assets (including movable and immovable property) or income, all members of the household are considered poor people.

2.  If less than one-third of the household members have an occupation, and their monthly income cannot afford enough rice for all household members, the number of people exceeding the rice affordability threshold will be considered poor people. (If a household has three members, and only one has an occupation, or a household has six members, and only two have an occupation, and they are responsible for the livelihood of the entire household, it will be considered that the one-third standard is met and will not be considered poor people). For example: Mr. Jia from the Zhenru District is an employee of a certain organization. His income for July is 14.4 million yuan. Including himself, he is responsible for six people (two adults and four children). The monthly rice consumption is eight dou. If maintaining the minimum living expenses for three people requires 400,000 yuan per day (excluding rice), the monthly cost is 12 million yuan. The remaining 2.4 million yuan is used to purchase three dou of subsidized rice for July, which costs 3 million yuan. After offsetting income and expenses, there is still a shortfall of 600,000 yuan. In addition to receiving three dou of public education rice for free, he is unable to purchase the subsidized rice allocation of one dou per person for the remaining three people. Therefore, three members of the household should be considered poor people.

### Chief Prosecutor Zhang Yuquan of the District Prosecutor's Office States Decision to Rectify the Morality of Judges; Warns Speculative Merchants to Abide by the Law and Focus on Business

The newly appointed Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Zhang Yuquan, met with a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday, emphasizing the importance of the morality of judicial officials today, which he will vigorously rectify. He said: Only when judicial officials themselves have a spirit of abiding by the law can they represent the country in enforcing the law. Therefore, at the beginning of his tenure, he prioritized the morality of judicial officials. Zhang also warned speculative merchants to abide by the law and focus on business. He stated: The current soaring prices in the city are actually due to the speculative merchants' failure to comply with the law. In the past, Chinese people considered not abiding by the law as "honor." This morbid psychology must be eliminated. Today, only when everyone has a spirit of abiding by the law can the country move towards stability. Chief Prosecutor Zhang is currently working on reorganizing the work of the Prosecutor's Office. In the future, prosecutors will strive to be swift in handling cases. Every case must be resolved within one week. The detention of criminals will also be carefully determined according to their crimes to avoid wrongful imprisonment. Finally, Zhang told the reporter: There are a large number of criminal cases in the city. The office receives an average of more than 100 cases per day, totaling more than 3,000 cases per month, which is one-third more than the entire province of Jiangxi.

### Publication of Workers' and Staff's Cost of Living Index; Increased by Nearly 100% in Half a Month; Workers 1.38 Million Times, Staff 1.07 Million Times

[Our Newspaper's Report] The city's cost of living index for the first half of July has been calculated by the Municipal Government Statistics Office and was released yesterday. The total index for workers is 1.38 million times, an increase of 670,000 times compared to June (the previous month was 710,000 times). The total index for staff is 1.07 million times, an increase of 510,000 times compared to June (the previous month was 560,000 times). The cost of living index for workers and staff is listed below:

Workers:

Food: 1,420,000 times

Housing: 960,000 times

Clothing: 332,000 times

Miscellaneous: 1,540,000 times

Staff:

Food: 1,430,000 times

Housing: 260,000 times

Clothing: 2,730,000 times

Miscellaneous: 1,080,000 times

Index for the Second Half of the Month Expected to Stabilize The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Review Committee held its 15th meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Zongmeng, the head of the Municipal Government Statistics Office, reported on the situation of rising prices: the increase was less than 50% for fresh fish, salted fish, haircuts, etc.; the increase was between 51% and 70% for corn, pork, beef, dried tofu, socks, etc.; the increase was between 71% and 80% for soybeans, soy sauce, electricity, etc.; the increase was between 81% and 100% for salted pork, fermented bean curd, matches, Shilin cloth, trams, Xian rice, etc.; the increase was between 101% and 110% for flour, soybean oil, coarse cloth, flannel, soap, etc.; the increase was between 110% and 140% for boiled water, twill, Baiye tofu, coal briquettes, etc.; the increase was between 191% and 200% for chives, spinach, etc. The price of household sugar remained unchanged.

Zhang continued: The reason for the increase in the index in the first half of July was that the allocated rice and public utilities (electricity, trams) were all adjusted in the first half of the month. However, public utilities will not increase in the second half of July, and the price of allocated rice will also remain unchanged, so the index for the second half of the month is expected to stabilize. After careful deliberation by the committee members, they were satisfied and signed the index sheet. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM.

### Lobotomy (1) New Achievements of Young Doctor Liu Mingduo

— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

[Our Newspaper's Telegram from Qingdao, 12th] For half a century, surgery has increasingly expanded its position in the field of medicine. Many previously incurable internal diseases can now be resolved by direct surgery. The two world wars brought a myriad of strange and unusual traumatic cases. Medical scholars are grateful and pained for the provision of this large amount of material. The needs of the times are forcing surgery to develop by leaps and bounds.

War Madness During the war, the soldiers and people of various countries went mad in the tens of thousands due to artillery fire and hardship. This war madness is a global human health crisis. Social human oppression has also created countless madmen. The increase in the rate of illness is almost progressing simultaneously with industrial civilization, putting medical scholars around the world on the threshold of one of the most difficult subjects. Medical scholars then thought of using a scalpel to probe the brain nerves, just as telephone workers repair a switchboard.

Surgery for lung disease in a major operation must have extremely complex equipment to allow the lungs to continue breathing during the operation and avoid the lungs from bursting due to air pressure. However, for the brain, the central nervous system, although this part remains in a static state, it is not something that surgeons can easily try.

Liu Mingduo, a young doctor (34 years old this year), deputy director of surgery at the Qingdao General Army Hospital, with the enthusiastic encouragement of President Wang Wei, cured several war mental patients with "frontal lobotomy," completing a glorious surgical achievement. He chiseled open the skull of the patient, cut off the frontal lobe of the brain, and then sewed up the wound. Two hours later, the patient woke up from anesthesia, and his spirit was completely restored to normal. Except for the need to rest and heal the wound, he had become a normal person. That is to say, he is no longer crazy.

Too many people went mad in the two world wars. Chinese soldiers went mad on the battlefield, some because their nerves were directly injured, causing certain organs to lose their effectiveness. The number is also considerable. It is speculated that there will be no statistics on it at the moment. The Qingdao General Army Hospital has cured two madmen, and three more are waiting for surgery. Battalion Commander Cheng Zhili's right arm was pierced by a bullet, and the nerves were damaged. After the wound healed, the entire back was paralyzed. Dr. Liu Mingduo operated to connect the nerves, and the arm was able to move freely. Soldier An Shuwen was injured on the battlefield and suffered severe stimulation to the brain. He was unable to speak. After the wound healed, he remained mute and could only communicate in writing. Dr. Liu Mingduo also chiseled open his skull and corrected the nerves. He started from one, two, three, four, and now he can talk normally, resting in the hospital, playing around everywhere. Soldier Wen Huisheng was injured on the upper right side of his head on the battlefield, developing traumatic epilepsy combined with left hemiplegia. He was similarly rescued by chiseling open the skull and using resection surgery. He has now recovered. When I visited him, he was playing chess with his roommate.

Brain and Frontal Lobe "I am an ordinary surgeon. I have only been studying surgery for ten years, and my experience is limited. For brain surgery, because the Army Hospital has many cases of brain injuries, it has aroused my interest in research. At present, in addition to frontal lobotomy for two diseases, there are also several cases of craniotomy, three of which are significant."

Dr. Liu Mingduo said this. That day, he opened the back of another injured patient's head and removed a bullet with pliers. He moved his fingers like flying, and after the surgery was completed, he walked out of the operating room with me, dripping with sweat. Ten days ago, a local newspaper published the news that he had cured two mental patients, and the Central News Agency rebroadcasted it. He said, "I am still researching. It is a bit exaggerated." He does not agree with me publishing it. "There are many senior veterans in the medical field."

"Mental illness is one of the most difficult subjects in medicine. I don't have a deep understanding and knowledge of this subject, and the examinations for mental analysis, etc., can be said to be very incomplete. There is no mental hospital in Qingdao. These madmen are causing chaos. The internal medicine department has no way to deal with it, so it was decided to use surgery at the hospital affairs meeting."

After lunch that day, he gave me an important explanation of the function of the frontal lobe and the brain.

There are many theories suitable for frontal lobotomy. Because the problem of brain function has not yet been accurately determined and the cause of mental illness has no definite answer, further research is needed. Physiologists now believe that the frontal lobe is the highest center of the spirit, the treasure trove of knowledge, the center or organ of psychology, with moral concepts, emotions, knowledge, etc. stored within. However, the results of the frontal lobe resection experiment prove that this statement is not accurate. The frontal lobe does not concentrate all the essential elements of higher spirit here. Knowledge is formed by absorbing external things, such as vision and hearing. It stores different sensations in different parts of the cerebral cortex. This cortex has a large number of nerve fibers connected, which interact with each other and synthesize into more complex memories. The more time passes, the more complex the interwoven experience becomes. The frontal lobe represents the area of this comprehensive ability. Therefore, once both sides of the frontal lobe are cut off, the person can no longer make more subtle comprehensive experiences, so that social actions are not suitable and judgments cannot be normal. However, if a part of the frontal lobe tissue is left and not removed, then his ability to synthesize experiences still exists.

### Pseudo-Songjiang County Magistrate Yang Shijie Re-enters Prison; Arrived in Suzhou Yesterday to Surrender, Saying He Was Fooled

[Our Newspaper's Telegram from Suzhou, 15th] Yang Shijie, the imprisoned traitor and pseudo-Songjiang County Magistrate, who was collusively released by the court bailiffs and police of the Suzhou High Court, suddenly came to Suzhou from Shanghai this afternoon to surrender. Zhang Chen, the prosecutor, and Yao, the presiding judge of the criminal court, successively opened court to interrogate him. It is reported that Yang confessed: On the 5th of this month, court bailiff Zhou Jiucheng came to the prison to chat and encouraged him to apply for bail. He then instructed his family to contact Zhou. On the 8th, he prepared a bail application, and on the 9th, he was released, believing that it was legally approved by the court. Therefore, he took a bath, shaved his head, burned incense to thank the gods, and stayed overnight at the Queen Hotel. The next day, he went to the First Prison to visit fellow prisoners, such as the pseudo-Taixian County Magistrate Zhu Han, and said goodbye. He also went to the sub-prison to collect his belongings, took a car to Shanghai, and entered the Yongchuan Hospital in Eight Immortals Bridge for treatment. He then read the Shen Bao for several days and realized that he had been fooled, which had harmed his guarantor. He rushed back to surrender today to clarify the truth, etc. After the interrogation, he was taken into custody. The High Court's court and prosecutor's office have held several court sessions in secret. Even the court bailiffs were barred from the criminal court's session, so the truth of the matter is still awaiting public announcement by the court.

Due to monetary reasons, Chinese stocks saw a sharp decline in trading. Rice and grain prices fell by one million yuan due to price drops in production areas, with top-grade white rice falling to twenty-eight million. Food prices, which had risen too sharply the day before, corrected yesterday, falling by about 10%. The market price of artificial silk also declined slightly. The price of cotton cloth was slightly higher than yesterday due to rumors of the issuance of large banknotes. Cigarettes and daily necessities were also slightly higher by 0.5%.

Although the cost-of-living index released yesterday had increased by nearly onefold, commodity prices were not affected due to the tight money market. Although retail prices in stores had already increased in the afternoon, retail prices are adjusted daily within this week, not only yesterday.

In the past month, due to soaring commodity prices, the general purchasing power of citizens has been very weak. Most of the currency circulating in the market is in the nature of bargaining chips. Therefore, it is said that capital is not opposed to the adjustment of the cost-of-living index this time, believing that this is the only way to improve the purchasing power of society.

Another report: Recently, there has been a severe shortage of cash in the market. To this end, various commercial banks are negotiating with the Central Bank, hoping to increase the issuance of cash to meet market needs. The business community believes that the current situation of tightening money cannot be maintained for a long time, and judging from the situation of commodity prices, large banknotes will inevitably be issued sooner or later. Yesterday, rumors spread in the city that the Central Bank intends to imitate the stamp value-added method, stamping small banknotes with customs gold seals to turn them into large banknotes to cope with the panic of cash shortage. However, the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank has denied this.

Another report: Yesterday was the middle of the month, and the demand for cash bargaining chips in various industries was even more lacking. According to the National Bank, the bank is trying to allocate the missing chips and is currently supplying them as much as possible, prioritizing urgency. The shortage phenomenon can be gradually eliminated. It is rumored that the bank will allocate cash, but this is not the case.

Another report: Yesterday, the city's money market trend remained tight. In the clearing of bills by the silver and money industry, the four banks, two bureaus and one treasury had a total shortfall of 644.1 billion, including a shortfall of 504.3 billion for the Central Bank, 238.1 billion for the Bank of China, and 144.3 billion for the Bank of Communications. The Farmers Bank had a shortfall of 120.7 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a shortfall of 207 billion, the Postal Remittance Bureau had a shortfall of 247.8 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a shortfall of 11 billion, the commercial banks and private banks had a large shortfall of 118.3 billion, a small shortfall of 186.68 billion, and foreign banks had a total shortfall of 134.1 billion.

### Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Flour and Edible Oil Markets Are Also Promising

Yesterday, the rice market continued to decline. Because the tight money situation did not abate, goods owners continued to sell off. The Tin market reported a decline, shop interest was very relaxed, and sales were sluggish, so prices were reduced by another 100 to 200 million yuan. Special high-grade japonica rice was 29.5 million, medium white japonica rice was 27 million, and the rice mill interest in coarse indica rice was very sluggish, opening a bag price of 21 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million. Glutinous rice also fell to 28.5 million.

Flour: The early opening was very weak. Because individual investors saw low prices and took them in, the central market immediately turned strong, and eventually saw more squeezes. Those with tighter positions in the morning market continued to sell off. Old car flour once fell to 8.2 million, and Bingchuan flour once retreated into 8 million. Finally, old car flour was 8.6 million, and some shouted 8.7 million. Bingchuan was 8.5 million, and Hongfeng, Jiancheng, etc. all rose by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, and wheat bran increased by 300,000.

Miscellaneous grains: The early market was weak and then firm, with slight differences in ups and downs. Yellow soybeans were initially rejected and could not be opened. Transactions began after the Shantou market opened. Zha soybeans finally reached 14 million, a rise of more than 1 million. Duzhou soybeans fell by millions in early trading, but turned up at the close. Corn and Yuanmai Qingbang went out of stock slowly and continued to cut 1 million yuan. Green beans were tired again by more than 1 million. Red sorghum was rarely traded, broad beans also tended to be tired, and sesame was quite firm and expensive due to the patronage of the Tianjin gang, and raw kernels continued to cut millions.

Edible oil: The market sentiment turned up. The opening price of soybean oil was similar to the previous day. After all, the price was low, and individual investors saw this low price and absorbed frequently. Although oil mills and return goods had opened, they were still not as good as the strong buying momentum. Finally, soybean oil closed at 60 million yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil hit the 70 million mark again. Jiton Sheng oil finally shouted 79 million, and raw vegetable oil 56 million, generally rising by 2 million to 3 million. Soybean cake into the household stomach is strong, Yu Ji cake is the most active, closing at 6.85 million, up 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.

### Reasons for the Difficult Development of the Export Control Commission's Work

[Report from this newspaper] According to people from the Export Control Commission: The difficulty in developing the work of the Commission is entirely due to the objective environment. The difficulty in increasing exports is due to excessive fluctuations in domestic commodity prices, which have resulted in too high export prices, affecting their competitiveness in the international market. The inability of imports to meet the needs of all parties is due to the shortage of foreign exchange positions. As for the issue of the survival of the Commission, it is believed that if the government's trade control policy is not changed, the Commission cannot be abolished. In addition, the Commission decided to send four representatives to participate in the decision-making body within the US Aid Utilization Committee to regularly discuss the distribution of US Aid materials imports.

### Silk Falling

Artificial silk fell slightly in yesterday's market. Jin San Ma with light No. 120 opened at 1.65 billion yuan in the morning, once rising to 1.75 billion yuan, but fell due to tight money.

### Taiwan Sugar's Inventory in Shanghai Can Be Supplied Until the End of the Year

According to the person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company: Recently, all walks of life have been rumored that Taiwan Sugar's production has been reduced in the production area, and the quantity in Shanghai has been reduced. This is purely a rumor deliberately spread by illegal merchants in an attempt to raise sugar prices. The amount of sugar transported from Taiwan by our company is indeed less than before, but in fact, because there is too much inventory in Shanghai, calculated according to the current allocation volume per period, the inventory in Shanghai can be maintained until the end of this year. Moreover, because there is no empty space in each warehouse, the number of shipments to Shanghai has been reduced. Sugar merchants can apply for sugar distribution as much as possible, and the company will not restrict sales to dispel rumors and stabilize sugar prices.

### Tea Market Rises and Falls Narrowly

Yesterday's tea market, Longjing green tea, which is exclusively for domestic sales, had a tendency to compete in the street shops, but unfortunately, this type of variety has dried up in the market, and most of the raw tea in the production area is the old third and fourth batches of goods, so it is not suitable for reproducing Longjing, and the transaction is not smooth. In terms of price, Wei Zhan Yunxiao has a promising prospect of rising. For other varieties, the morning opening was in the revival of the principal, and the market once became firm, but later the money market was extremely tight, and it was heard that the dark interest was as high as 70%, and borrowing was still as difficult as climbing to the sky, and the process returned to equilibrium. As a result, they all stuck to their original positions and did not change at all compared to before.

Export container tea mortgage loans were handled by the Farmers Bank in May, and the number in June was not large, totaling more than 6,000 boxes, only more than 3,000 dan. The quantity this month has increased dramatically, and new tea from various producing areas has been transported to Shanghai in large quantities. As of now, it has reached 16,621 boxes, totaling about 10,000 dan, which is almost double that of June. The Agricultural Bank has lent out 8 million to 10 million per dan, and has lent out more than 100 billion, mainly Pinglv, Suihong, and Wenhong.

### Yarn and Cloth Market Turns Up, China Textile Yesterday Threw Cotton But No One Asked

Yesterday's cotton yarn market, at the beginning of the market, due to the tight money situation, both local and foreign merchants were slack in paying, the selling atmosphere on the market was strong, but the sales were sluggish, and the market situation was also frustrated due to the decline in off-market prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened at 1.3 billion, and after 10 o'clock, it was heard that the cost of living index had soared, and manufacturers were slack in selling because of cost concerns, and all parties' hearts turned firm. This street and the guest gang reopened their stomachs, and the market rose step by step, and finally ended at 1.45 billion yuan, and tomorrow it will be 1.55 billion yuan, a rise of 100 million yuan from the previous day. 21-count Shuangma also had 130 million to 40 million, and the remaining count fine yarns also rose by 70 million to 80 million to about 100 million. There were 41 orders for the whole day, a total of 182 pieces of coarse and fine yarns.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market, because the National Bank had a large amount of yarn money and tax money, the money market was extremely tight, and the transactions in the market turned clear. It was heard that the dyeing factories had bid for a lot of unpopular goods in recent days, and their positions were also tight, so they had to throw out popular goods to relieve their urgent needs. Longtou fine cloth once rose from 35 million to 6.5 million yuan, and finally shouted 34.8 million to end, a rise of 1 million yuan. In addition to Bi Ji Bu Xiu, the remaining cloth showed a state of slight waves.

Another report: At first, there was a rumor that Fangjian Company would sell Longtou fine cloth by bidding, and then it was Caiqiu fine cloth. The cloth merchants filled in the price of 28 million to 9.52 million yuan. There were also second-class Yuan Bi Ji, Sijunzi Piaobu Yuan Guang Xie Tiaosheng Hui Guang Xie, etc. Ten types, two types of bed sheets.

Another report: Yesterday, China Textile still sold cotton as usual on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee. All purchase procedures were similar to the original regulations. Yesterday's purchasers went to the raw material department to collect the purchase orders, and the cotton sold was handed over to the stack, and the variety was still Shaanxi cotton. However, after the listing, because the money market was still tight, no one asked. As a result, China Textile purchased 2,000 dans at yesterday's original price (245 million yuan per dan).

Another report: The Business Office of China Textile recently announced that all empty yen cotton cloth stack orders stored by the company must be cleared within one week. There are two empty households in the second warehouse and 38 in the third warehouse that have not been cleared.

[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing on the 15th] Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education mentioned in his report to the Education and Culture Committee of the Legislative Yuan that he plans to start implementing a plan to popularize national education starting from the 38th year and hopes to complete it within ten years. The content and progress of this plan are recorded as follows: The promotion of popular education began in the 30th year. The Ministry formulated a five-year plan for popularizing national youth education and handled it first in the 19 provinces and cities in the rear. Starting from the 35th year, a second plan for popularizing national education was formulated, and all provinces and cities across the country were handled uniformly. Since its implementation, firstly, the local education funds have been affected by the unified revenue and expenditure. The original funds have been transferred, and the education surtax has also been sharply reduced. The existing primary schools cannot be maintained, and expansion is even more impossible. Secondly, the county education bureaus have been abolished and changed to departments. There are no dedicated personnel in charge of the planning and implementation, and local education administration has fallen into a state of semi-paralysis.

### Less Than Half of the Current School-Age Children Are Enrolled in Schools

Therefore, there are currently only 24 million children in school nationwide, which is less than half of the school-age children. As the constitution is about to be implemented, the popularization of education should be handled more actively. Therefore, the Ministry is considering the actual situation and re-formulating a plan to popularize national education, with the goal of completing the popularization work within ten years. It will be implemented starting from the next year. The main points of this plan are: (1) The plan and funds must be closely coordinated, (2) Sound local education administrative institutions, (3) The compulsory education period for school-age children should be six years in principle, (4) The training of teachers and the expansion of schools must be coordinated, (5) Primary schools shall not charge tuition fees, and books shall be provided to poor children, (6) The annual increase in school-age children shall be stipulated by year according to the actual situation of each province and city. The reorganization of local education funds and the universal restoration of education bureaus are also being actively handled.

### Official Explanation from the National Bank Regarding Foreign Exchange for Self-Funded Students: Both First and Second Cohort Students Will Be Handled at Official Rates

[Our Newspaper] A spokesperson from the Central Bank committee responsible for reviewing foreign exchange applications for self-funded students stated that since the recent revision to the foreign exchange control regulations, which introduced foreign exchange settlement certificates, there has been considerable misunderstanding among self-funded students regarding the purchase of foreign exchange. The following clarification is provided: (1) Self-funded students who have passed the Ministry of Education's first and second cohort examinations, upon approval of their foreign exchange application, regardless of whether they have already departed the country, are entitled to purchase foreign exchange at the official rate, and are not required to provide a foreign exchange settlement certificate. (2) The term "scholarship students" who purchase foreign exchange at the official rate does not refer to any student who has received a scholarship from a foreign university. It specifically refers to scholarship students approved by the Ministry of Education for overseas study. This means that the student has already received a scholarship from a foreign university or educational institution before leaving the country, and the Ministry of Education has also approved their departure based on this qualification, and they are currently continuing to receive the scholarship from the foreign university or educational institution. Generally, self-funded students who receive scholarships from foreign universities or educational institutions after going abroad cannot be treated in this manner and must still purchase foreign exchange at the official rate plus a foreign exchange settlement certificate. (3) According to the Ministry of Education's explanation, there have been no scholarship students approved for overseas study since the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on March 14, 1947. Any such scholarship students approved for overseas study after this date will not be allowed to apply for the purchase of foreign exchange.

### Introducing Academic Institutions: Private Great China University

History: In June 1924, more than 300 students from Xiamen University left the school en masse due to inappropriate measures by the authorities, and remedial actions proved ineffective. Fearing that they would have to discontinue their studies midway and betray their initial aspirations, they sent representatives, including Sun Kangzeng and Ni Wenya, to Shanghai, requesting nine former Xiamen University professors, including Ou Yuanhuai and Wang Yuxiang, to establish a new school so that they could continue their education. In September, the new school was organized and named "Great China University." It temporarily used the premises at 201 Xiaoshadu Road in Shanghai as its campus, and officially started classes on September 22nd. On November 22nd, the Board of Directors elected Dr. Ma Junwu as President and Mr. Wang Boqun as Chairman of the Board. In March 1928, in accordance with the school regulations promulgated by the University Council, the position of Chairman of the Board was changed to Chairman, and the position of President was reinstated, with the addition of a Vice-President. Wang Boqun was elected as Chairman and President, and Huan Yuanhuai as Vice-President. In the spring of 1929, more than 100 acres of land were purchased next to Zhongshan Road in Fanhuangdu. In May of the same year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to the school for inspection and deemed that it was well-managed, granting it official registration. In the autumn of that year, active preparations were made for the construction of a new campus. Former President Ma Junwu and Ou Yuanhuai and Wang Yuxiang traveled south in the summer heat to raise the first phase of construction funds from overseas Chinese in Malaya, building the first phase of school buildings at a cost of more than 300,000 yuan. The buildings were completed in August 1930 and the school moved in in September. In 1931, a large number of books and instruments were purchased, and 300 acres of land were purchased for the school, a sanatorium was built, and various other constructions were planned. When the August 13th Incident suddenly broke out, Great China University and Fudan University jointly formed the First and Second Joint Universities in Lushan and Guiyang, respectively. Later, as the war situation deteriorated and the national army moved west, the Guling campus moved inland to Guiyang. More than 1,000 acres of land were purchased in Hua'ao, 20 miles from Guiyang, and Great China University was designated as a permanent campus, building six or seven school buildings. At that time, President Wang Boqun maintained the school with illness, and suddenly developed stomach cancer, passing away on December 26, 1944. Chairman of the Board, Sun Zhesheng, immediately convened a board meeting and elected Ou Yuanhuai and Wang Yuxiang as President and Vice-President, respectively. At the beginning of the war, the Shanghai campus was unable to move inland due to the obstruction of most faculty and students at sea. In 1938, a branch school was established in the isolated city of Shanghai, borrowing the Hongyi Middle School on Jing'an Temple Road as a temporary campus, and continuing teaching in a difficult environment. This continued for six years until victory. In the autumn of 1945, after the Japanese surrendered, the school returned to its old site on Zhongshan Road in Shanghai. However, the campus, which covered more than 400 acres, suffered significant damage during the war. The scenery along the Liwa River was completely changed, and the once magnificent buildings were reduced to rubble.

Current Status: The school currently has five colleges: Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, and Education. In the last semester, there were more than 2,800 students, of which the College of Education is unique in Shanghai, with more than 300 students. The deans of the five colleges and the heads of the departments are as follows: Dean of the College of Arts: Du Zuozhou, Head of the Department of Chinese Literature: Cheng Junying, Department of Foreign Languages: Chen Mingen, Department of History, Geography and Social Sciences: Su Xishi. Dean of the College of Science: Shao Jialin, Head of the Department of Mathematics and Physics: Zhou Changshou, Department of Chemistry: Chen Jingqi, Department of Civil Engineering: Wang Xing. Dean of the College of Commerce: He Yichao, Head of the Department of Accounting: Gong Qinghao, Department of Banking: Cai Wenxi, Department of Business Administration: Guan Kebui. Dean of the College of Law: Zhang Junqing, Head of the Department of Law: Lin Wopeng, Department of Political Science: Ge Shouyuan, Department of Economics: Han Wenchuang. Dean of the College of Education: Huang Jingsi, Head of the Department of Education: Tao Yuchuan, Department of Educational Psychology: Zhang Yaoxiang, Department of Social Education: Zeng Zuozhong.

Admissions: Private Great China University will hold two rounds of entrance examinations for new students this fall. The first round of examinations will be held on July 22nd and 23rd. The second round will be held on August 23rd and 24th. The deadline for registration is three days before the examination date. The examination venue and registration location is the school at 307 Zhongshan North Road. The enrollment quota is 40 to 50 new freshmen per department in the Colleges of Arts, Science, Commerce, Law, and Education, and a number of transfer students in the second and third grades.

### After the Reorganization of the National Sports Federation, Sports Associations are Established in Various Places: Branch Federations Will be Reorganized and Merged

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Since the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association resolved to change its name to "Republic of China Sports Association" at the board meeting held in Shanghai in May of this year, the fundraising and operation of the association after the reorganization have been delayed because the important officers of the association, standing directors, and general secretaries have gone to England to participate in the World Games. The work will begin actively after the return of the members. It is reported that the members of the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association in various places have proposed establishing association branches in various places, so some places have both a sports association branch and a sports association. According to the relevant officials of the National Sports Commission of the Ministry of Education: In the future, the Republic of China Sports Association will only set up a general association and will not set up branches, because the sports cause is from the bottom up, not from the top down. For example, the Republic of China Sports Association is located in Nanjing, and Nanjing only has a sports association, not a sports association branch. The Nanjing Sports Association should carry out various sports activities and proceed automatically at any time according to the needs of the environment, and it is not instructed by the association before it can be promoted. By analogy, since there will be no sports association branches in various places in the future, those associations that have already been established in various places should be reorganized into sports associations to comply with the law and avoid duplication.

### A Turning Point

— Shuo Fu

One day these past few days, I took the 24 trolleybus from the Central District to the former French Concession. After the trolleybus reached Simar Road, the seat I was sitting on was already scorching hot from the sun. If I were to stand up, the bus would be so crowded that there would be no room to stand, but in my heart, I was silently hoping that as long as the bus turned a corner, the sun would no longer be shining directly on me, and it would be relatively cooler.

This psychological expectation of the trolleybus turning a corner is similar to our situation in a stagnant situation, waiting for a turning point. Although the sky is full of haze, there will eventually be a day of clearing. Moreover, people always think of things in a good way. "Another village" does not necessarily have the beauty of "a glimmer of light after passing through the dark willows," but we always dream of the realm of "a glimmer of light after passing through the dark willows."

Recently, everyone seems very uneasy because of the soaring prices. This may be an inevitable phenomenon in extraordinary times. In fact, in a changing era, this is just an interlude promoted by the objective environment. There is no lack of precedents in Chinese and foreign history. For example, during the American Revolutionary War, the value of currency plummeted. A section in a book records:

"In the summer of 1780, the common currency was despised. As Washington put it, to buy a cartload of goods, you had to prepare a cartload of banknotes for her. At the end of 1778, American dollar bills in the northern states were worth only one dime and six cents, and in the southern states they were worth only one dime and two cents. By the beginning of 1780, the currency value had fallen to two cents. Before the end of the year, it got worse and worse, so that ten paper dollars were worth only one cent."

The same book also said:

"In October of that year, the wholesale price of grain in Boston was $150 per bushel, $12 per pound for white tower salt, $90 per pound for tea, $10 per pound for sugar, $8 per pound for beef, $12 per pound for coffee, and $1,575 per barrel for flour. A man named Samuel Adams spent $2,000 to buy a hat and a suit of clothes. Before long, the currency stopped circulating, debts could not be calculated, and the credit system was completely destroyed."

The economic chaos in the United States at that time was truly unimaginable, but later the American Revolution was successful, and under the management of Finance Minister Hamilton, currency credit was restored, laying the foundation for future prosperity. I think that under the various active measures of the government authorities, a turning point is bound to come. When the economy stabilizes in the future, talking about the current situation will be like a nightmare.

### Master and Madam

— You Mojun

At the end of the dying Qing dynasty, I took up a teaching position. At that time, schools were called "academies," teachers were called "instructors," and school workers were called "errand runners." Errand runners called instructors "master." As a young man in my early twenties, standing among a group of "standard masters," I had no choice but to allow people to call me "master" and respond casually, but I always felt very uneasy! After the Republic of China was established, the title of "master" was abolished in schools and replaced with "teacher," which made me feel greatly relieved. Although some people in society still used the title of master, fortunately I had not yet reached the eligible age, so it had nothing to do with me.

The most ridiculous thing is that some people actually call themselves "master." For example, when returning home late and knocking on the door, if the servant asked who it was, the answer would be "I am the master." It is not known when the title of "master" began. According to Yu Quyuan's Small Collection, it is recorded in the Biography of Dong Boxiao in the History of the Yuan Dynasty, "I am Master Dong." Checking the History of the Yuan Dynasty, Dong made this statement after being captured alive by Zhu Gui's soldiers and being asked who he was. He replied, "I am Master Dong," and then was stabbed to death by the crowd. This is the self-proclaimed master seen in official history. The same book also quotes Xu Mengxin's Compilation of the Three Dynasties' Northern Alliance in the Song Dynasty, saying that there was a military rebellion in the Yumo Mountain stronghold, and the commanding generals Wang Lin, Meng Gen, Zhang Yatu, etc. killed their commander "Master Ma." This is the title of "master" seen in unofficial history. Considering the various sources, it is known that the title of "master" already existed between the Song and Yuan dynasties, and both Dong and Ma were military personnel. It seems that this title was limited to military positions, and it is impossible to know whether civil servants also used this title.

"Madam" is the spouse of "master." This refers to how people call them today. If you want to prove it in "ancient times," it seems quite difficult. Historically, it is recorded that Emperor Ai of Han honored his grandmother, Empress Dowager Fu of Dingtao Gongwang, as Empress Taetae, and later as Empress Huang Taetae. This is the first time the two characters "taetae" were used together, but this was a royal honorific. The practice of officials and civilians respectfully addressing each other as "madam" may have evolved from the royal honorific. This title is much more "ancient" than master.

### The Story of the "Baby Carriage"

— Liu An

A hundred years ago, there was an inventor in the United States named Ban Deng. Seeing that women were struggling to carry their children out, he had a flash of inspiration and invented the "baby carriage" for children to sit in.

However, his new invention was not only unwelcome, but was even attacked by men and women across the country! An editorial in a women's magazine said, "The baby carriage snatches the lovely child from the mother's arms, and there is no greater harm to the love of family." Men cursed even more fiercely, saying that baby carriages could simply destroy family happiness. One eloquent orator said: "If children sit in baby carriages, mothers can often go to places far away from home! I wonder what is in her heart!"

Ban Deng was so reviled by them that he had no place to live and had to flee from New York to Europe. At this time, things finally turned around for the better. Queen Victoria of England and Queen Isabella of Spain both liked the baby carriages he made, and everyone bought them for the princes and princesses to sit in. From then on, the baby carriage was officially popularized in the world.

### On the Play "Selling the Horse"

— Xuezhai

"An Odd Reunion" is a Yiyang opera. It is said that the script came from the imperial court. Later, everyone followed the performances of Wang Lengxian and Chen Delin as the standard. Its exquisiteness is almost impossible to describe. Among those who inherited the art of these two, Hongdou Guan Master got all of Wang Lengxian's skills, and Jiang Miaoxiang also got seventy to eighty percent of them. Miaoxiang initially learned the role of female from Delin, and was renowned as the best among his peers at the time. Later, due to vocal cord problems, he switched to playing young male roles. Delin and Lengxian often paired up in male and female roles. Lengxian's gestures, voice, and appearance were all heard and seen by Miaoxiang, allowing him to learn the role of Zhao Chong in "An Odd Reunion." However, in the scene of "Breaking Through the Barracks," young male actors often rely on a bold and unrestrained performance to achieve a good effect, which Delin was unfamiliar with since he did not share the stage with young male actors. At that time, there was a martial artist named Ru Laiqing, the ancestor of Ru Fulan, who was advising Miaoxiang on the martial arts aspects of "Eight Great Hammers" at the Yaguan Building. He greatly admired Wang Lengxian and made sure to watch all his plays, both martial and civil, understanding them deeply. He was able to fully grasp the gestures of Zhao Chong in the "Breaking Through the Barracks" scene. He then appeared in person to explain the scene to Miaoxiang. Therefore, those in the world who speak of "An Odd Reunion" believe that, apart from Pu Wu, only Miaoxiang fully captured the spirit of Wang Lengxian. As for plays that involve intimate banter and subtle expressions of love, only Kunqu opera can fully convey their nuances and extreme charm. However, the boundary between Kunqu and Yiyang opera is very strict, and incorporating Yiyang into Kunqu is quite incompatible. Judging by style, Yiyang belongs to the "Flower Department" and is a type of "Clapper Opera," while Kunqu belongs to the "Elegant Department," naturally having a distinction between elegance and vulgarity, like the Jing and Wei rivers that cannot be mixed. For example, Han Junqing and Bai Yunsheng, who are veterans of Yiyang opera, when they try to sing Kunqu, the awkward and incompatible parts of their breathing and vocal rhythms are clearly undeniable, which can serve as evidence. However, in the early years of the Republic of China, the Kunqu opera troupe in Shanghai called Xin Le Fu, although talented people emerged, the traditional repertoire such as "Pipa Record," "Eternal Life," and "Jade Hairpin" were too familiar and could not captivate the ears of Shanghai people. Therefore, plays like "Double Pearl Record," "Selling Rouge," and "Fifteen Strings of Cash" emerged, and Li Yu's works were also regarded as new sounds and were repeatedly staged. It was at this time that "An Odd Reunion" entered the Kunqu stage with Yiyang melodies. The singing was based on seven-character and ten-character lines, without fixed melodies but with interludes. The dialogue was colloquial and straightforward, without the elegant and beautiful charm of Kunqu opera, but it was precisely its simplicity and accessibility that pleased the people of the time. Those with little knowledge even regarded it as the same as Kunqu opera, unaware that it was Yiyang opera. Although this was due to changing customs, it also showed that the "Under the Willow" style was popular, and it could not be explained by reason. [Editor's Note: This is the language of a true connoisseur, a quick discussion that can be followed by a large drink.] Yu Zhenfei, from a prominent Jiangnan family, promoted the study of opera and became a professor at the Xin Le Fu Kunqu opera troupe. He liked the script of "An Odd Reunion" and did not despise its Yiyang roots. He often staged it, incorporating the elegant and refined vocal and physical expressions of Kunqu opera into the Yiyang melodies. Its beauty was almost unparalleled, and he quickly gained fame. Compared to the art of Hongdou and Miaoxiang, which originated from Lengxian, and Lengxian was also a Kunqu opera performer, Zhenfei entered the opera world later and, through the play "An Odd Reunion," greatly enhanced his reputation, overshadowing young male actors from the north. Alas, it was indeed a great success! However, in terms of Kunqu opera, those who can perform the official male roles in "Library," "Meeting Mother," and "Sudden Change" are generally superior to Zhao Chong in status. But this can only be said to those who understand, even if it is said to common people. Since Zhenfei became famous with this play, those in Jiangnan who perform it have all changed its name to "Selling the Horse," which also shows the trend of the time. Xun Huisheng also once re-edited this play, starting from Li Qi's loss of his wife, followed by his remarriage to Yang Sanchun, and Li Qi selling horses, Yang's evil plan to drive away his first wife's children. The character Gui Zhi and Bao Tong were first played by children, until the two were rescued separately, Gui Zhi marrying Zhao Chong, and Bao Lei being appointed to a high position. Although the plot seemed clearer, the problem of being lengthy was unavoidable. In "An Odd Reunion," the "Crying in Prison" and "Writing the Complaint" scenes already clearly narrate the past, and the story is well known. If the past is repeatedly staged, it will only bore the audience. The role of Li Baoyi was originally played by second-tier young male actors. In the past, when Hongdou Guan Master performed as an amateur, and when Zhu Suyun was in Mei Lanfang's troupe, Jiang Miaoxiang volunteered to play the supporting role, because Hongdou and Suyun were disciples of Miaoxiang, which also showed respect for the elders. However, after 1945, when Huang Guiqiu and Mei Lanfang performed this play in Shanghai, Yu Zhenfei played Zhao Chong, and Jiang Miaoxiang was forced to play Bao Tong. Miaoxiang's seniority was before Zhenfei's, and critics said that he was brave in promoting younger generations while disregarding his status, not knowing the reason. Jiang was a person who always repaid kindness, and he had received Zhenfei's help in a certain matter, so he repaid him by playing the role of Bao Tong. Who knew that this would become a precedent, and people in the opera world and the audience came to believe that "Selling the Horse" would be incomplete without Miaoxiang's Bao Tong, which would be a great disappointment. Although it was a consolation in his old age, Miaoxiang was nearly sixty years old. In terms of "An Odd Reunion," what he had indirectly received from Lengxian, and what was like a remaining cultural relic in the Lu Temple, was unexpectedly unrecognized and unexplored. Is this not a pity?

### Rubbing of the Remaining Stone Stele of Jiang Zong at Mount She

— Fang Junqian

A melody from the Linchun Hall's Jade Terrace,
Back then, he served as a close advisor, showcasing his poetic talent.
For thousands of years, people should count Lord Jiang of the Jiang family,
Truly seeing extravagance used to become a Prime Minister.

The misty moonlights of the Six Dynasties are all desolate,
Countless green mountains escorting the horse's hooves.
The child points and explains that it's Jiang Zong of Liang,
Pointing to the rosy clouds, searching for the poetic themes.

### Changing Trains

— Xu Gan

The house I live in now is not far from the earliest railway laid in China. Whenever a train comes and goes, I can not only hear it, but also see it; however, what I see is not the train itself, but the glass on the doors and windows that rattles and shakes as the train passes.

This happens more than a dozen times a day, so that guests who happen to experience this will notice it and say to me, "Sitting in your room is like sitting in a train car."

Yes, even if I am not in a room like this, I have always felt like I am on a train, changing from one train to another, from one car to another. Some people spend their entire lives lying on a solid and stable bed, but they still end their lives. That motionless bed is still being pulled forward by a train engine, slowly and quietly.

They don't stop at any stations along the way, they don't get off the train, and they arrive; they are fortunate. I am not such a fortunate passenger.

I am about to change trains again.

### American Snippets

— Xiansi

Among the past American presidents, three are most revered by the British, and statues have been erected in London to commemorate them. These three presidents are: George Washington, the founding father of the United States; Abraham Lincoln, the liberator of slaves; and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who united democratic countries to defeat fascism.

The national flag flying on the roof of the U.S. Capitol has been changed to be made of "nylon," which is said to be more durable than cloth flags. In the past, when cloth flags were used, a total of twelve to fourteen flags were needed each year.

The exteriors of American trains have recently been mostly painted with a special paint that glows at night, like a luminous watch, so that drivers of speeding cars in the dark can see them from afar, reducing accidents.

Pennsylvania State University in the United States recently established a bone "bank," storing bones in extremely low-temperature ice cellars, specifically for surgeons to use when joining bones.

### The Difficulty of Screenwriting

— Huanren

We are currently facing a very turbulent era. Taking the film industry as an example, last year, films such as "Fake Phoenixes and Real Dragons" caused a stir because they involved plotlines about barbers. Therefore, playwrights and filmmakers, learning from previous lessons, have to be extremely cautious and deliberate repeatedly when writing or filming, fearing that they might offend a certain aspect and face severe interference. This kind of external interference is not only happening in our country, but now, even Hollywood screenwriters are feeling this pain. In addition to government agencies and the House Un-American Activities Committee, they also face formal or informal scrutiny from certain moral organizations. Those who write screenplays are almost always in the wrong. In a May issue of "Screenwriter Weekly," there was an advertisement offering a large sum of money for screenplay material. This advertisement precisely reveals the infinite suffering that Hollywood screenwriters feel due to constant external interference. Now, I will translate this advertisement below:

"A writer is seeking novel material for writing a screenplay, the content of which must avoid politics, religion, divorce, double beds, drugs, illness, poverty, alcohol, congressmen, bankers, cigarettes, wealth, Congress, race, economics, art, death, crime, childbirth, accidents (airplanes or cars); and the nationality of the villains in the play cannot be American, European, South American, African, Asian, Australian, New Zealander, Eskimo... not even dogs. Applicants please contact Box Thirteen."

### Against Eschatology

— Gongsun Wu

According to modern scholars, Zhao Zichen's "Biography of Jesus" estimates that Jesus was actually born in 7 BC and crucified on April 7, 30 AD, at about midday. If the calculation of his birth year is correct, the "Son of Man" was on earth for no more than thirty-seven years. Jesus lost his father at the age of nineteen. His mother witnessed his suffering at Golgotha; John's Gospel does not mention how his mother grieved, truly knowing that no one knows a son like his mother. Zhao's book has many new ideas and is written in a lively style, different from the usual religious texts. Its main point is to deny that Jesus was an eschatologist, arguing that Jesus was not a follower of eschatology but an abolisher of it. He said, "Resurrection, judgment, and the end of the world are certainly what Jesus believed in; but if eschatology speaks of the kingdom of God as something that has not yet come but will come suddenly, and when it comes, the world will be judged, Israel will be restored, and God's wrath will be poured out on all who are sinful; Jesus' teachings are very different from these teachings. Zhao believes that "Jesus himself is the life of resurrection, whether people believe or not is a judgment, and the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, is the judge." This argument inspires me and allows me to reread the New Testament. How can those who stick to the old ways understand this?

### Miscellaneous Notes from the Pavilion Where Rats Peep

— Yu Shou

Summer in Chengdu (Part 2)

There are few rivers and canals in Beijing, so the puddles of Shichahai are cherished by Beijingers. In summer, stalls selling tea are set up, and tens of thousands of people gather like ants, creating an indescribable commotion. (The same is true for Beihai.) Chengdu, on the other hand, has crisscrossing streams, and people set up small stalls everywhere, placing low chairs and selling Tuo tea with sincere charm, enough to make people while away an afternoon. Under the tall willows, people sleep soundly with their chests bared, undisturbed, without forcing the issue; this is the enjoyment of water.

The scale and grandeur of Shaocheng Park are certainly not comparable to Zhongshan Park in Beijing, but its simplicity and elegance match the overall style of Chengdu. We stroll through it and feel more in harmony with nature. Sichuan people have a widespread habit of drinking tea, and teahouses are everywhere. The park also mainly features these, selling pure tea and not iced water or melon juice, so the atmosphere is not ruined, which I like most.

Chengdu is a more conservative city, and it still preserves many of the Beijing court's styles in terms of food, drink, and clothing. I have already explained the reason for this. This is why people often say that it resembles Beijing. However, in recent years, Beijing has become poorer and can no longer maintain its old standards, while Chengdu still has ample resources. The Jisheng snack shop in the eastern part of the city specializes in selling high-quality summer snacks, making cakes from ripe cherries and soup from pickled tangerines, with excellent color, aroma, and taste. These are classic Beijing court dishes, while the snacks sold at Beihai Fangshan in Beijing at this time are already coarse and difficult to swallow.
