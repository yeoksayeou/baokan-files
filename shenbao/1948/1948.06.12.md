### An Honest Analysis of the Crisis Before Makeup; Striving to Break Open a Stagnant Situation; Weng Wenhao Reports on Administration in the Legislative Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The ninth meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 11th. The meeting commenced at 9:15 AM, presided over by President Sun. After all report items were completed one by one, emergency motions were passed by Wang Puhan, Cheng Tianfang, and others regarding the order of questions to be asked after hearing the Executive Yuan's report on administration. This order involved general reviews of national defense and military affairs, financial and economic issues, diplomatic matters, and other issues. At 9:50 AM, Premier of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao delivered his first report on administration since taking office, the full text of which was over 10,000 characters. Weng adopted a calm attitude, honestly analyzing the current administrative crisis. He stated with a firm tone that he would resolutely shoulder this heavy responsibility and break open the long-stagnant political situation. He also emphasized that strengthening the strength to suppress bandits was his primary goal at present.

Weng first emphasized the seriousness of the national situation, stating that reform and governance were the consistent expectations of the people. The Executive Yuan would administer according to the Constitution and national policy, and the most important task at present was suppressing the rebellion to stop the Communist bandits' attempts to engage in political strife using armed force. In military affairs, the government was determined to strengthen the defense of the Northeast and North China, improve the treatment of soldiers, boost morale, clarify conscription, and support local armed forces. The goal was to ensure that everyone recognized that protecting their homes and suppressing the Communists was the greatest contribution that people could make to the country. He was unwilling and unable to answer when the entire task of suppressing the rebellion could be completed. However, he said that if it could be quelled within two years, it would be an excellent achievement. All other administrative measures would be coordinated with the suppression of the rebellion. The government was determined to use a clean and capable government to get through this serious time. The budget would still be divided into ordinary and special parts. The special part was almost entirely the raising and expenditure of military funds. Food for the people could rely on American aid, but military grain would still have to be requisitioned and borrowed. However, the government would strive to make the process simple and reliable to avoid disturbing the people.

### Strengthening Local Organizations to Coordinate with Military Suppression of the Rebellion; Reforming the Currency System with Careful Consideration of Effective Measures

In terms of internal affairs, the strengthening of local organizations was of paramount importance. The draft of the General Rules for Provincial and County Self-Government was being carefully studied. The effectiveness of local governments must be improved to ensure that government orders are implemented and to flexibly coordinate with military affairs to assist in suppressing the rebellion. In terms of finance, taxation was the mainstay of revenue. Both the system and tax regulations needed to be actively improved. The principle of "those with money should contribute money" must be established. First, the situation of large properties should be clarified, the regulations on the use of names should be strictly implemented, and property should be registered. Then, targets should be determined, procedures should be simplified, and property taxes, income taxes, inheritance taxes, etc., should be effectively collected. This would ensure that large cities where wealth is concentrated could also fulfill their tax obligations. Tax regulations would be calculated favorably, and inefficient tax collection agencies would be resolutely reduced. In terms of expenditure, government agencies should be effectively tightened or merged, and these vacancies should be used to place people in areas where talent is lacking and projects are waiting to be developed, and to provide relief to the unemployed. The reform of the currency system involves too much, and careful consideration must be given to a sound, easy-to-implement, and most effective method. The issuance of bonds must first establish credibility in order to absorb floating capital, stabilize the market, and reduce smuggling. In terms of economics, exports of Taiwan sugar, cement, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth should be added to foreign trade, and the quantity should also be increased. The application of political force and the awakening of patriotism should be used to eliminate smuggling. Overseas Chinese should be encouraged to increase the remittance of cash to balance expenditures.

### Solving the Price Problem Through Supply and Allocation

The problem of prices will be solved through sufficient supply and universal allocation. The adjustment of the selling prices of public enterprises should be reasonable and gradual to avoid stimulating general prices. In terms of construction, three key tasks are being prepared to be launched in the shortest possible time: (1) Industrial production and transportation construction. After the victory, the industries and mines, and transportation in North and Northeast China were repeatedly damaged by Communist troops. Future construction can only open up the situation with great difficulty and will be planned and carried out in accordance with the policy of suppressing the rebellion. Reports of the southward relocation of industries are purely rumors. The government still plans to replenish machinery and raw materials for the industries in the war zones. However, to ensure the security of the South and the recovery of the North, a foundation should be laid early in the Jiangnan region. Therefore, the transportation capacity of the Yuehan and Zhegan railways and the construction of the coast and Taiwan must be strengthened, especially the textile industry, which has already achieved considerable scale, should be helped to obtain raw cotton to avoid stagnation. (2) Land registration and distribution. Rent reduction and land consolidation in the liberated areas have been underway for a long time. In the future, we will continue to design and implement sound measures based on the national land policy to solve the land problem and make the international community recognize that the Communist bandits' so-called land policy is actually reckless behavior. (3) Improvement of agricultural production. Our country is based on agriculture, but this does not contradict the development of industry. The improvement of agricultural production relies especially on the application of industry, the full supply of water conservancy, fertilizers, and mechanical farm implements, which are important means to increase production and save labor.

### Diplomacy Still Based on Consistent National Policy

In terms of diplomacy, we will still adhere to our consistent national policy, with seeking world peace through the United Nations as the primary task. We will continue to strengthen friendly relations with all countries, especially the United States. Regarding policy toward Japan, we are determined to adhere to our established position. Military aggression must be eradicated, while industries necessary for the people's livelihood can be retained. At the same time, we are determined not to see it turn red. We can agree with any Allied country whose views on the Japanese issue are similar to ours; otherwise, we will oppose them. As for the emerging countries of Asia, our country will befriend them. If India, with its large population, unites with our country, it will ultimately be able to promote world peace. The effectiveness of American aid is divided into two parts according to its nature. One part is material goods, which can help us reduce imports, and the sales price can also bring back legal currency. The other part is loans, which can help the restoration of our agricultural and industrial production and construction. The way it is used still applies to the ten principles personally formulated by President Zhang. We will strengthen the work to make it a reality. Educational and cultural facilities need to be strengthened. In recent years, the Communist Party has made extensive use of students, affecting the stability of social order in the rear. Therefore, in addition to normal cultural and educational work, we must pay attention to ideological education. Finally, Weng stated that those responsible for administration are determined to work tirelessly and hope that, in addition to having a consistent goal for constitutional governance, the Legislative Yuan can also work together to carry out the work of suppressing the rebellion and achieve complete success.

### Legislators Enthusiastically Question; Incisive Remarks Are Frequently Seen; Continuing the Questioning at the Tenth Meeting Today

Weng's report ended at 11:10 AM, lasting one hour and twenty minutes. President Sun then announced that, according to the provisions of Chapter 9 of the Rules of Procedure, the Legislative Yuan could immediately raise questions after listening to the report on administration. Those requesting to speak were very enthusiastic. Everyone should have the opportunity to speak on this important national matter. With the consent of the audience, the questioning should proceed until it is completed, and if it is not completed in one day, it will continue for another day. After a break, President Sun again appealed to the audience to be patient for the sake of democracy. Questioning began at 11:40 AM. The morning session adjourned at 12:30 PM, and the afternoon session was also extended to 6:30 PM. A total of 23 people asked questions orally, and more than ten people submitted written opinions. Those requesting to speak were still coming in an endless stream at the time of adjournment. The meeting proceeded tensely and enthusiastically, and incisive remarks were frequently seen. Lai Lian, Gu Zhengding, Du Guangxun, Xiao Zheng, Chen Shaojin, Zhang Qianhua, Cheng Tianfang, Sun Guiji, and others successively raised general reviews. Many believed that Weng's report was smooth and considered all aspects, but in reality, it was empty. Chen Ming said that the goal was to hope how to achieve it, but the policies and methods for its realization were not specifically proposed. Lai Lian also pointed out that the military suppression of the rebellion has been failing in recent years. How will military affairs be strengthened in the future? How will troops be used? How will the treatment of soldiers be improved? The recent surge in prices can be seen as a challenge to the new government. How will it be dealt with? Will the diplomatic policy continue the incompetent style, or will it be newly formulated? The front line is suppressing bandits, and the rear is experiencing student unrest. Are there any appropriate and effective measures? He said: Premier Weng's appointment in the face of danger is admirable. Although the Legislative Yuan has reluctantly agreed, it will be difficult to win the trust of the people if no solutions are produced. Gu Zhengding pointed out that the current local organization is not competent, and local leaders lack standards. He then asked why the suppression of the rebellion does not thoroughly rectify the grassroots level that is creating Communist bandits. As for diplomatic policy, suppressing the rebellion means being anti-communist, so why continue to vacillate in the future? Xiao Zhong asked (1) What will be used to suppress the rebellion? Simply relying on military affairs without the Three People's Principles is all empty talk. (2) What policies will be used to stabilize prices? Will the policy of issuing currency continue to balance the budget? (3) How will local administration be strengthened? Will military personnel continue to be appointed to preside over provincial affairs? (4) Agriculture, forestry, industry, and commerce are extremely important. Why are you giving official positions to party members, leaving no one to take responsibility? Chen Shaojin emphasized that the administrative policies in Weng's report did not take into account the timing, resulting in an emphasis on heavy topics, and accused the Executive Yuan of having no progress in suppressing the rebellion and lacking confidence. Zhang Qianhua said that since the Weng Cabinet has not escaped the old circle of personnel, it is difficult to expect any action. Why not refresh the people's ears and eyes in the use of personnel and work hard to govern? Cheng Tianfang also pointed out that the administrative policies lacked timeliness, progress, and specific measures. A six-month administrative target should be pre-established to show how efficient it is. Sun Guiji criticized the errors in Weng's report from a conceptual point of view. (1) Emphasizing South China as the foundation for suppressing the rebellion may disturb the people of the North. (2) Land reform does not extend to the rear. Is the government's land policy only implemented after the Communist bandits destroy the rear? (3) How can the report ignore the employment issue? Relief is not a fundamental way to stabilize society. (4) The United States' support for Japan should be emphasized. How can we not investigate the current situation in Japan and report to the country? How can we not strive for the compensation from Japan that we deserve and instead borrow from the United States and ask for help? In addition, Pan Chaoying, Qiu Hanping, Wu Shangying, and others all raised the issue of overseas remittances and the protection of overseas Chinese. Wu Fu questioned why the Minister of National Defense is still a military person and asked whether there are any measures to eliminate military factions and cliques, clarify rewards and punishments, and rectify military discipline. Ma Chengfeng, Chen Yiyun, Du Guangxun, Zhao Pei, Wang Puhan, and others all requested explanations on the specific measures of military actions. Gao Tingzi raised the issue of how to stabilize prices and when to reform the currency system. Li Yaolin suggested that the Executive Yuan should find out what obstacles past failures encountered and how they can be eliminated. Jian Guansan said that the new cabinet, from the President down, is mostly made up of people with expertise in industry. What measures do they have for economic construction? They should bring them out. Xu Zhongqi, Zhao Huimo, and others all questioned what measures would be taken to deal with the soaring prices. All questioning was conducted by alternating oral statements with the reading of written opinions. Premier Weng and the heads of various ministries and commissions also sat quietly on both sides of the platform all day, listening and taking notes at all times. At the time of adjournment, President Sun announced that there were more than one hundred people waiting to speak, which would be left to the continuation of the meeting on the 12th for further questioning, and then adjourned the meeting.

[Another Telegram] The Legislative Yuan held its tenth meeting on the 12th to continue questioning the Executive Yuan's report on administrative policy. If there is sufficient time, Premier Weng or the heads of relevant ministries and commissions will first give some oral answers.

### Hoffman Asks Congress to Restore the Original Amount of Aid to China; Lapham Also Says that Reducing It Is Like Going Back on Our Word

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Dispatch] Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman today asked Congress to restore the original amount of $463 million for the aid to China plan. He believes that the House of Representatives' reduction of $63 million and extension of three months will seriously endanger the plan to combat the Chinese Communist Party. Hoffman's statement was read by Cheng Er, special assistant to the Economic Cooperation Administration, to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Hoffman said: The aid to China plan aims to enable the Chinese government to overcome inflation and make the necessary urgent tasks to defeat the Communist bandits. He pointed out that Lapham has arrived in China and is only waiting for a firm implementation plan to review various needs and stipulate the content of the organization. Hoffman listed the various difficulties faced by the aid to China plan in the rapid changes of finance and economy caused by the civil war. He said that China needs more personnel than European countries. The basic reason for the situation in China is that the long-term destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Communist bandits and the extensive struggle have led to increasingly severe inflation. China relies on imports to maintain its economy, but inflation and other factors have reduced its exports and dollar remittances, thereby reducing China's ability to pay for imports. Hoffman said that American aid alone cannot help China solve various difficulties, but it can only delay the extent of its economic deterioration. Hoffman finally pointed out that when the House of Representatives reduced $60 million, it did not specify whether this reduction was calculated from military funds.

[This City News] Lapham told reporters who visited him yesterday about the House of Representatives' reduction of aid to Europe and China, saying: He supports Vandenberg's opinion and hopes that Congress will not reduce the aid. Lapham said: We have promised various countries and China. Now, if we reduce it, it is like going back on our word.

Lapham then talked about his meeting with President Chiang in Nanjing, saying: He told President Chiang that the task of this trip is to comply with the guidance of the US Congress and require the cooperation of the Chinese government to implement the aid to China plan. He said that President Chiang agreed to this point.

### Yu Hongjun Visits Lapham to Discuss Issues Related to American Aid

[Our Newspaper News] It is learned that Lapham's current work in Shanghai, in addition to contacting relevant parties in our country, focuses on internal organizational matters. Since Lapham came to China alone, the composition of the American aid agency in the future will mostly use the staff of the China Relief Mission. Lapham and the investigation team moved into the Dangsted Research Institute, the original site of the China Relief Mission, yesterday. After returning to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday afternoon, Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun immediately visited Lapham to discuss various issues related to American aid, and left after about an hour.

The Stillman Investigation Team is about to depart, and the time for the investigation in South China is scheduled for three months. After the matter is completed, they will return to the country to report.

[Another Telegram] Yan Jiagan, member of the American Aid Utilization Committee, Wu Xueli, director of the Technical Department, and Li Fuguo, deputy director of the Accounting and Verification Department, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 11th Dispatch] The outskirts of Yanzhou are becoming increasingly tense. Parts of the 7th and New 8th Columns of the Communist bandits attacked the outskirts of Yanzhou and Qufu on the 11th, and another force rushed towards Wenshang. Under the command of the famous general Li Yutang, the National Army in various places gave the bandits a head-on blow and launched fierce battles.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 11th Dispatch] The Battle of Yanzhou, which has been brewing for many days, opened on the evening of the 9th. At the moment, the battles on the outskirts of Yanzhou, Wenshang, and Qufu are all proceeding fiercely. The bandits besieging Qufu launched a fierce attack on the city walls all day on the 10th. After the National Army calmly endured the pain, they did not succeed. On the morning of the 11th, a large formation of Air Force planes sortieed from Jinan and cooperated with the National Army in the air over Yanzhou and Qufu to fiercely attack the stubborn bandits.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 11th Dispatch] In order to cover the harvesting of wheat, the National Army and local forces in northern Henan have launched extensive attacks in recent days, successively recovering counties and towns such as Fengqiu, Yanjin, Qixian, and Daokou, reaching the suburbs of Hua and Jun counties, and annihilating half of the main force of three regiments of bandits reorganized from local Communists near Xiaodong Village, east of Wuzhi.

Then, they flew from Puyang County over Yuncheng and Juye, bombing and strafing the places where the bandits were gathered along the way. The bandits suffered heavy losses.

### The Reorganization of the Examination Yuan is Approaching; The President is Considering the Nomination of the President, Vice President, and Others

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] While the Legislative and Control Yuans are holding meetings, the Examination Yuan will also be reorganized in accordance with the Constitution. The President, Vice President, and members of the Examination Yuan will be nominated by the President and appointed after being approved by the Control Yuan. The Examination Committee and the Ministry of Personnel, which originally belonged to the Yuan, will also be reorganized into the Ministry of Examinations in accordance with the new Organic Law of the Examination Yuan. According to the Organic Law of the Examination Yuan of the Constitutional Government, which was amended and promulgated in December 1947, the Yuan should have 19 Examination Committee members and set up the Ministry of Examinations and the Ministry of Personnel. The task of the Examination Committee members in the future will be an expansion of the task of the current Examination Committee members, comprehensively coordinating matters related to examinations, including the design and drafting of important laws and regulations related to fundamental issues of examination and personnel management. In the future, the Constitution stipulates that civil servants shall not be appointed unless they pass the examination. If personnel are appointed, the examination work will inevitably become more cumbersome, and the "overall coordination of examination matters" by the Examination Committee members will focus on the original part of the examination. It is learned that the Examination Yuan recently submitted the resumes of the current Examination Committee members to the President. According to general speculation, although the selection of Examination Committee members will inevitably include people from the Min and Qing parties and non-party people, it will also attach importance to experts in various subjects who are familiar with the current system in order to match their specialized tasks. It is learned that the President is currently considering the nomination of these Examination Committee members and is expected to submit them to the Control Yuan for approval and appointment in the near future.

### First Anniversary of the Beitashan Incident, Enemy Cavalry Have Not Withdrawn from the Border, Garrison Remains Vigilant, Preparations for Long-Term Stationing Completed

[Our Newspaper Dihua, 10th] The 10th marks the first anniversary of the Beitashan Incident. The national army stationed at Beitashan has spent a year in a harsh and difficult environment. Recalling this day last year, it was precisely when the enemy used fierce joint air and ground firepower to launch a surprise attack on our garrison. Ultimately, thanks to the steadfast and courageous fighting of our loyal soldiers, we defended our national territory and held our position. Today, this reporter made a special visit to General Ma Chengxiang, the cavalry commander who recently inspected the defense of Beitashan. He informed me that since the incident, there have been six fierce battles in total. The enemy ultimately failed. Since the beginning of last winter, Beitashan has been subjected to severe cold. Although the enemy has temporarily stopped attacking our garrison, there is no sign of withdrawal. Therefore, our garrison must prepare for long-term stationing. We completed cold-weather equipment before winter, built underground barracks, stables, and clubs to stabilize the lives of officers and soldiers. General Ma praised the hard work and endurance of the Beitashan garrison, saying that it is truly commendable that they have fought hard in the harsh mountains for a year without a single sick soldier or weakened horse. The reporter continued to ask if there was a possibility of war breaking out in Beitashan recently. General Ma emphatically replied to the reporter: The war began a year ago. The Mongolian cavalry that invaded our territory 600 li beyond the border has only increased, not decreased. They are now actively strengthening rear transportation and building defensive fortifications, confronting us under Beitashan. The crisis threatening peace in Xinjiang has not been resolved. As for combat, it can occur at any time. In short, unless the Outer Mongolian troops withdraw from our territory, the border defense of Xinjiang will not be secure for a single day.

Editorial

### Starting with the New Cabinet's Policy Guidelines

Premier Weng has submitted a report to the Legislative Yuan yesterday regarding the new cabinet's policy guidelines. This is not only the linchpin of the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, but also the focus of attention from people at home and abroad. After the new cabinet was formed on the first of this month, some people in society thought that there were too many old faces in the new cabinet, and that old figures could not implement new policies. Therefore, they made many dissatisfied criticisms of the new cabinet. However, most people still held an attitude of expectation towards the new cabinet before the policy guidelines were published, hoping that Premier Weng could come up with new ways to reverse the current crisis.

However, Premier Weng's policy report to the Legislative Yuan yesterday was not only a boilerplate but also empty, ordinary, and lacking any sign of new policies. It was simply a continuation of the previous cabinet. The new cabinet was already criticized for having too many old faces in terms of ministerial candidates, with only three or four changes. In terms of policy guidelines, it is the same old tune of the previous cabinet. How can this satisfy the national expectation of "using new people to implement new policies," and how can it meet the "desire for change" in the general public! Therefore, after Premier Weng's report, many legislators raised questions and expressed dissatisfaction, subjecting the Weng cabinet to an even more serious test.

According to the current domestic situation, suppressing the rebellion and building the nation is the national consensus, and no one can oppose it. Therefore, the central problem of the current situation revolves around the two key points of military affairs and economy. Suppressing the rebellion and building the nation can be said to be a military problem, and it can also be said to be an economic problem. During this period, the focus of any government's policies must be concentrated on these two issues. Furthermore, judging from the current actual situation in the country, military affairs and economy have become two sides of the same coin, often mutually influencing each other. Military setbacks on the front lines will undoubtedly deepen the economic crisis; economic disorder in the rear will also deepen the military crisis. Therefore, if these two problems need to be reformed, they must be reformed simultaneously with a two-pronged approach. Today's Weng cabinet is also the first cabinet after the implementation of the constitution in our country. Its current task is not only to clean up the old situation but also to create a new one. The responsibilities it bears are particularly heavy. But in practice, the focus of the new cabinet's policies should still be concentrated on these two issues. In other words, if the military situation can improve and the economy can stabilize, then other problems will not be difficult to solve. When we comment on the new cabinet and examine its policy guidelines, we don't need to discuss other things, as long as we see how the new cabinet can overcome military difficulties and economic crises, we can judge its success or failure.

Let's take a look at the new cabinet's policy guidelines. Regarding military affairs, the new cabinet plans to take the following measures: (1) continue to strengthen military strength; (2) improve soldiers' treatment; (3) unite morale; (4) support local armed forces; and give full play to the local security forces to assist the national army in suppressing the rebellion. Regarding the economy: (1) make good use of American aid, on the one hand, use American materials to stabilize prices, and on the other hand, use American loans to increase production; (2) strive for economic construction, but still prioritize adapting to the needs of suppressing the rebellion; (3) regarding the budget, make the regular budget as balanced as possible, and make the special budget based on the needs of the war, and continue to collect grain and taxes, and levy property taxes to make up for the shortfall in revenue and expenditure; (4) in terms of finance, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, in addition to strengthening tax collection, we should also save expenses, and implement currency reform according to actual needs; (5) in terms of finance, continue to strengthen control; (6) in terms of agriculture, on the one hand, implement land reform and redistribute land, and on the other hand, strive to improve production technology to increase production.

From the above policy guidelines, we can't find any signs of new policies. However, a government should not talk too much, but only strive to do its best. Before the war, Premier Weng participated in the government as a scholar, responsible for developing resources. During the war, he presided over the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Wartime Production Board. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Resources Committee. He has made outstanding achievements in important positions and has always been admired by people at home and abroad. Premier Weng is a practical scientist who does not like empty talk. He would not ignore reality and sing high-sounding tunes. Therefore, we should not be disappointed because Premier Weng's policy guidelines did not raise the tone. If Premier Weng can be pragmatic and do what he says, it will not be difficult to turn the entire situation around in two or three months.

Although we cannot deny that the Weng cabinet itself is fragile, and Premier Weng himself is a simple and unpretentious scientist, it is not easy for him to deal with five or six hundred legislators. However, analyzing the current situation, the Weng cabinet is worthy of our people's support. The next month or two is the most difficult period for the Weng cabinet, when things are in a state of transition. If it can safely overcome the difficulties with the support of the people, the position of the Weng cabinet will become stronger day by day. Therefore, today, we should enthusiastically encourage the new cabinet, and in the national atmosphere of dissatisfaction, redouble our efforts, on the one hand, strive for self-reliance, and on the other hand, make good use of American aid. As long as we have a plan and the courage to act, we can reverse the economic crisis and overcome military difficulties in two or three months. The current criticisms from the people are not yet the final conclusion on the success or failure of the Weng cabinet!

### Establishment Day of the Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Management Association, Zhuang Zhihuan and Others Express Their Views

The organization of the China Industrial Management Association was established last year in the capital. The promotion of association affairs and work procedures have been determined one by one. The Shanghai branch has been actively preparing and is already showing signs of success. Today is the day of the general assembly. Mr. Zhuang Zhihuan and Mr. Xia Zonghui specially expressed their grand views and submitted them to this newspaper for publication. It is deeply believed that it will arouse the interest and attention of people in the industrial and academic circles to the issue of management, and seek improvement in implementation. (Editor)

Mr. Zhuang Zhihuan first expressed his views on industrial management and industrial construction in our country as follows:

The research object of industrial management is to further explore how to obtain the highest efficiency of organization, management, and coordination of human resources and machinery in addition to technological improvement. Its main content can include four parts: The first is the management of production, the goal is to maintain mass production and product standardization. The second is the management of finance, the goal is to rationally operate capital to reduce costs and increase profits. The third is personnel management, the goal is to improve the quality and work efficiency of employees, so that people are suitable for their jobs and jobs are suitable for their people. The fourth is motion study, the goal is to review various actions in each production process, to make them reasonable, fast, save time, and reduce fatigue, thereby maximizing work efficiency and production capacity. Motion study is the latest subject of industrial management. It must be based on human physiological conditions, psychological conditions, and the general and special performance of various machines, and even various factors of each action, to conduct in-depth and objective research and analysis before designing new, more reasonable production procedures, production methods, and production tools.

Industrial management has been introduced to our country in the past two decades. However, due to the traditional conservative concepts, and the extremely low cost of labor in the past, and the lack of fierce market competition, although the general public attaches great importance to modern production equipment and technology, they lack an understanding of the important value of industrial management. In fact, modern production equipment and production technology must be matched with modern management methods and management systems. Otherwise, even with the same machines and technicians as Europe and the United States, the products produced will never be able to compare with Europe and the United States in terms of quality, quantity, manufacturing cost, or overall work efficiency. If our country wants to promote industrialization, the principle of equal emphasis on technology and management must be confirmed first. In the past, due to low labor costs, traditional rural handicrafts have continued to linger, and modern industrial production has not been able to develop soundly. However, if this wasteful style of labor and time is not thoroughly reformed, industrial construction will never succeed. In order to transform agricultural society into an industrial society, it is necessary to eliminate the phenomenon of negative production in the past. American wages are high, so it is necessary to rely on modern management methods. The high general wages in our country today are far from comparable to the past. Therefore, when it comes to industrial construction today, it is impossible to succeed without emphasizing industrial management, so as to reduce manufacturing costs and improve production efficiency. I am delighted to hear that the Shanghai branch of the China Industrial Management Association has been formally established. I would like to briefly present my expectations and express my slight congratulations:

First, launch research on industrial management theory: Industrial management is a discipline created by industrially advanced countries. To transplant it to China, it must go through a process of cultivation. How can we avoid blindly copying foreign countries, and make the theory closely match the practice? This is what awaits our joint efforts.

Second, promote the training of industrial management talents: The cultivation of industrial management talents is undoubtedly the top priority in the future. However, at present, only Jiaotong University in our country has a Department of Industrial Management, which is obviously insufficient for the needs of future industrial construction. In addition, general engineering personnel must also recognize the indivisibility of management and technology, and promote the all-round talents with both the conditions of engineering talents and industrial talents, which is what we must strive for.

Mr. Xia Zonghui believes that industrial manufacturing is complex and the scope of management requires careful consideration. He further divides the tasks and scope of the management work implementation objects into the following ten points according to the manufacturing process and order, and describes their outlines as follows:

(1) Capital allocation: Capital is originally one of the factors of production. At the beginning of a business, the size of the enterprise and the scale of the factory are all based on the amount of capital. After the start of the business, the use and circulation of funds, the preparation of budgets, and other financial issues, such as the formulation of accounting systems and the calculation of costs, all require careful strategies and appropriate measures for overall planning to lay the foundation for the business.

(2) Plant layout: Consider the restrictions on the location of the factory based on the differences in manufacturing raw material origins, the types of transportation tools, the impact of climate on products, the supply of power and fuel, and the level of labor costs. Other tasks, such as the manufacturing of the plant, the intensity of light, the adjustment of air, and the regulations on indoor colors, must be properly designed to obtain a good working environment and increase production efficiency.

(3) Machine arrangement: If the machines through which the product passes throughout the entire manufacturing process are continuous, the order and height of the machine arrangement must be properly arranged, so that the consumption of human energy and the time of transmission stagnation can be greatly reduced.

(4) Raw material procurement: If the economy is stable, prices will fluctuate significantly. The purchase of raw materials required for manufacturing does not necessarily require a large amount of storage. The determination of the quantity should be based on the production needs and turnover, and the determination of the accurate quantity should be calculated by formula.

(5) Use of human resources: Use people according to their abilities, each giving their best, using strengths to make up for weaknesses, so that it can be effective. The selection of intelligence should be assisted by the industrial psychology test to explore the equivalent of talent and intelligence, to adapt to the needs of the work and achieve the consequences of efficiency.

(6) Method improvement: Manufacturing becomes more complicated day by day, and methods change day by day. Innovation is the only way to progress. Based on past use, enlighten later evolution, and conduct precise research, so that there will be achievements.

(7) Motion study: When production begins, the movements of machines and human labor follow. According to general circumstances, in all the movements to complete a certain fixed task, there are always unnecessary movement fragments or accidental delays mixed in, which are often difficult to detect without careful analysis. The purpose of motion study is to obtain the two major achievements of time and work with simple movements and the lowest consumption of labor. The implementation of the research should have a variety of equipment and film analysis available for reference as a basis for improvement and experimentation.

(8) Product review: There are many kinds of products, with different qualities, shapes, and colors, and it takes a lot of effort to repair, trim, and add accessories. Therefore, the standardization and unification of product standards has been promoted in European and American countries for a long time, and has achieved great results. If the domestic industry seeks progress, it is urgent to catch up. Other packaging designs must be carefully considered, and the functions of use must also be clearly stated to facilitate sales.

(9) Market distribution: Market surveys, regional divisions, records of consumption patterns, analysis of customer psychology, and preparation of statistical tables must be carried out sequentially to make the final effort in production and sales work.

(10) Implementation of management: The work of each department has been planned, and the management of each part is particularly important for communication. In order to make the work of each department resonate and assist each other, and the transmission is smooth, there must be a comprehensive overall management to formulate systems, implement policies, and observe the effect, to complete the most important task of industrial management.

To sum up the above points, the complete task of industrial management can be described as follows: "Plan adequate funds, set up suitable factories and appropriate machines, add appropriate raw materials, use improved methods and reasonable actions, implement artificial simplification, sell superior products through hard work, and use scientific management to obtain the greatest production effect at the lowest cost."

### Jewish and Arab Parties Launch Political War. Arabs Determined Not to Recognize Jewish State. Jews Also Refuse to Abandon Occupied Territories

[Our Newspaper Report] London 11th Broadcast: Amman Report, the Prime Minister of Transjordan predicted today that Arab countries may refuse to sit with Jews at the peace conference on Rhodes, saying this is the "traditional" policy of the Arabs. He further stated that Arab countries are still unwilling to accept the partition plan for the Holy Land. If the Jews insist on establishing a Jewish state, peace talks will be fruitless. Peace talks will not begin for at least a week. The Arab side agreed to the ceasefire this time only because UN mediator Bernadotte repeatedly stated that he was not bound by past resolutions on the Palestine issue and said that the Rhodes peace talks might produce a solution that is acceptable to the Arab side and fair to both sides.

[Associated Press Tel Aviv 11th] The war in Palestine ceased at 6:00 AM on the 11th (Greenwich Mean Time) in accordance with the 28-day truce plan recommended by the UN Security Council, but both the Arab and Jewish sides made a final attack on the evening of the 10th. The Jewish side sent planes to bomb Damascus, the capital of Syria, while the Arab armies bombarded the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem with the most intense artillery fire since the war began. The sounds of guns and cannons from both the Arab and Jewish sides have ceased, and political warfare has begun. Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion announced that the Jews would never abandon the Arab territories occupied during the war, while the Supreme Commander of the Arab forces, King Abdullah of Transjordan, stated in Amman that the Arabs would never agree to a peace that would subject Arabs to a Jewish state in Palestine.

[Associated Press Amman 11th] King Abdullah of Transjordan stated in a single interview with the reporter of the agency here on the 11th that the Arabs would never accept any truce that would allow the Jews to establish an independent Jewish state in Palestine. 阿氏 continued to say that the entire ruling power of the Holy Land should belong to the "sovereignty of the entire Palestinian Arab state. We are prepared to merge with the Jews of the Palestinian state. The Jews in the Palestinian state can enjoy the same rights as the Arabs. They can have the government they want in their cities and settlements, but they will have no ruling power. The ruling power is the sovereignty of the Arab state in the entire Palestine." Abdullah continued, if the Jews do not accept peace without ruling power, and the "Palestine War" continues, it may cause a third world war.

### Jewish and Arab Sides Accuse Each Other of Violating Holy Land Ceasefire Order. Bernadotte Intensifies Preparations for Peace Talks

Bernadotte had requested the dispatch of 63 military officers to supervise the ceasefire, to be served by military officers from the United States, France, Belgium, and Sweden. Gromyko stated that he would reserve the right to submit a resolution on assisting Bernadotte in supervising the various military officers of the ceasefire in the future. The Security Council then announced that it would continue to discuss the Palestine issue next Tuesday.

[France News Agency London 10th] Sources close to the government revealed that the British government is willing to participate in the supervision of the ceasefire in Palestine, and work on the side of the military officers of the United States, France, and Belgium. It is also said that Britain is prepared to provide ships and aircraft for Bernadotte's use to monitor the borders and coasts of Palestine. The Jewish side strongly opposes British participation, saying that if Britain is allowed to participate, there is no reason to refuse the Soviet Union's request.

### Secretary-General Lai Yi Publicly Advocates Forming a United Nations Volunteer Army. To Serve as a Backing for the Security Council's Force

[Associated Press Massachusetts, Cambridge 10th] UN Secretary-General Lai Yi delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the Harvard University Alumni Association here today, advocating that the UN should form a volunteer army before编组警备军 as a backing for the Security Council.

This is Lai's first public statement on the issue of UN forces. US Secretary of State Marshall proposed his European Recovery Program at the said曾 last year. Lai claimed that disagreements among the five major powers have hindered the formation of international警备军, but timely编组 a small-scale army is sufficient to handle various UN problems, including the Palestine issue. The five major powers must find a way to resolve their differences and reach an agreement on the警备军 issue. Currently, the UN can start with a smaller-scale volunteer army. According to well-informed sources, 级氏 will include this recommendation in his annual report or submit it directly at the UN General Assembly in Paris in September. The volunteer army is recruited by Lai from several countries, totaling about 1,000 people, and is regarded as staff of the Secretariat, paid by the UN.

### Initial Reaction. Particularly Cold

[Associated Press Lake Success 11th] The initial reaction to UN Secretary-General Lai Yi's proposal to form a UN 养勇军 is not very enthusiastic. The United States is carefully considering the plan.

### Soviet Military Authorities in Berlin Exert Pressure Again. Blocking Land Transportation Lines. Using Bridge Repair as an Excuse to Take Countermeasures Against Britain

[Reuters Berlin 10th] The "Berliner Zeitung," registered with the Soviet side, hinted that the last land route from the Western Allies to Berlin will be temporarily closed. It is generally expected that the Soviet Union will take new actions to make it impossible for the Western powers to maintain their position in Berlin. The newspaper stated that the road wooden bridge over the Elbe River near Magdeburg is in urgent need of repair. The bridge is essential for the highway from the West German occupation zone to Berlin. The bridge is hundreds of yards long, and repairs will take a long time. During the repair period, road traffic will inevitably be limited to a standstill.

It is generally believed that this is a countermeasure taken by the Soviet side in response to the British authorities' request to move the Berlin radio station out of the British sector of Berlin.

### US Senate Passes Peacetime Conscription Law. Increases National Military Strength to 1.95 Million

[Associated Press Washington 10th] The Senate passed the Peacetime Conscription Act today by a vote of 78 to 10, conscripting 200,000 men aged 19 to 25 into the army in the next year. The bill had already been placed in the bill procedure that must be decided before Congress recess, and was passed after a week of intense debate. It has now been sent to the House of Representatives. A similar bill is being blocked in the House Rules Committee and has been blocked for a month.

House Republican leaders say they will get the bill passed by the House before the scheduled June 19 recess.

The above-mentioned bill passed by the Senate has reduced the military manpower requested by President Truman. University military training has been cancelled, and the establishment of military strength will not exceed 1.956 million people.

After this bill is signed by the President, the wartime conscription mechanism will be restored. Within 60 days after this bill officially becomes law, all men aged 19 to 25 must register, but men aged 18 will not be conscripted unless they voluntarily receive 12 months of training. Then serve four years of reserve service, and may be granted exemption. The House bill completely allows men aged 18 to be exempted. The difference between the two House bills is that in the House terms, the president must be responsible for enforcement. The Senate bill grants exemptions to soldiers, government officials, civil servants, and theological students who participated in World War II. Scientists and other people may also be granted deferred or exempted service under special regulations announced by the President.

Purchase 2,000 Aircraft. Expand Air Force Strength

[Associated Press Washington 10th] The US Air Force announced today that it will purchase 2,201 aircraft as the first step in establishing an air force of 70 大队, including 243 bombers. The required funds will be allocated from the designated 1.34565 billion yuan for expanding the Air Force.

Building Super Aircraft Carrier. Approved by the Senate

[全衆社华,顿 10th] The Senate passed a bill today by voice vote, allowing the Navy to stop building 13 warships, and this bill has been transferred to the House of Representatives. The savings will be used to build one 65,000-ton aircraft carrier, designed for atomic bomb aircraft. Current laws require that ships that are more than 20% completed must be completed, but this bill makes these 13 warships an exception.

### Far East Commission Grants MacArthur Full Authority. To Allow Japanese to Participate in International Conferences. Japanese will also be allowed to study and do business abroad

[Associated Press Washington 10th] The Far East Commission granted General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, full authority to send Japanese people abroad to participate in intergovernmental conferences on the 10th. This move is a victory for the United States and MacArthur, as some countries have argued that MacArthur's dispatch of Japanese people abroad must first be approved by the Far East Commission each time without success. The Far East Committee passed this resolution on the evening of the 9th and notified MacArthur on the 10th. According to the committee's information, this move will clearly lay the foundation for the Far East Committee to pass another proposal by the United States, which is to send Japanese people abroad to study and allow Japanese businessmen to go abroad. The Far East Committee's decision authorizes MacArthur to dispatch Allied Headquarters observers to attend intergovernmental conferences when invited to send representatives, and to dispatch Japanese technicians to accompany them. The only condition is that this move should obtain the permission of the country where the meeting is held for Japanese people to enter. The Far East Committee's decision only makes the temporary unilateral procedure that the United States has already taken official. And MacArthur is now using the same unilateral procedure based on the temporary orders of the US government to send Japanese businessmen abroad to perform economic tasks.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Plan. Develop Textile Industry

### Soviet Scientists Pioneered. Celestial Botany

### Celebrating the King's Birthday. Thunderstorms Ruin the Scenery. Military Parade Temporarily Cancelled

[Associated Press London 10th] Today is the King's birthday, and the largest military parade since 1939 was originally scheduled to be held, but it was temporarily cancelled to avoid damage to the military uniforms due to heavy rain. The Army Ministry spent months collecting the only remaining complete set of ceremonial military clothing in the country, as no new clothing has been made since the war. 100,000 people turned out to watch the King's review, but the review was cancelled due to thunderstorms in the suburbs. However, the center of London was sunny and there was no sign of storms, and the crowd was filled with confusion and disappointment.

### Hoffman Urges Senate Allocations Committee. Restore US Aid to Europe Fund. Otherwise, It Will Hinder European Recovery

[Associated Press Washington 11th] Economic Cooperation Administrator Hoffman stated at the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 11th that Europe will not be able to obtain the necessary tools and machinery for recovery unless the foreign aid fund reduced by the House of Representatives is restored. Hoffman urged the restoration of the foreign aid fund reduced by the House of Representatives. Hoffman also said that the House of Representatives' reduction is equivalent to "the most productive and far-reaching part of the European aid plan being virtually cancelled. The first to bear the brunt of the reduction must be the machinery and equipment needed to restore and increase Europe's production capacity."

### Ferry "Treats" Passengers Once, Resumes Ticket Sales Yesterday Afternoon

### Urging Payment of Salary Income Tax, Will Be Handled by the Court if Overdue

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Municipal Direct Tax Bureau has decided that all salary income taxes must be paid in full by the end of June this year. However, there are still many who have not reported. For example, the salary income tax of performers in the drama industry has not been reported since the victory. This is because famous performers do not have fixed salaries, their mobility is quite high, and the income of famous performers actually includes the salaries of their accompanying staff, so although the reported income figures are very high, they differ greatly from actual income. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate. However, the Tax Bureau believes that there is no sufficient reason for those who delay paying taxes to refuse to pay. It has now been decided that all salary income taxes that have not been paid since the victory must be paid in full within the deadline. Any refusal or delay in payment will be transferred to the court for handling.

### Liu Deming's Use of Public Funds for Lending, Military Service Association Declares Inaccurate

According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Committee for Comforting and Rewarding Troops Passing Through the City: The allegation that Liu Deming, president of the News Agency for Friends of the Military, used 3 billion yuan of funds for purchasing comfort meat to lend out for interest while serving as the director of the catering department of the committee for comforting and rewarding troops passing through the city is not true. Since the establishment of this committee in August of last year, all expenses and purchases of comfort meat have been jointly approved by Resident Chairman Fang and Mayor Wu, and then issued by the City Bank. There has never been a case of receiving such a large sum of money for lending out for interest. It is also inaccurate to say that Liu is the vice chairman of this committee and the captain of the Pacifying Rebellion and Building the Nation Propaganda Team. This statement is hereby issued."

### Key Lies in Identity, Request to the Ministry of National Defense

The key to the case of Liu Deming, president of the News Agency for Friends of the Military, currently lies in clarifying his identity in order to determine whether he should be tried by military law or transferred to the local court for trial. It is reported that the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters has requested instructions from the Ministry of National Defense.

### Over 50,000 Tons of Foreign Rice to Arrive in Batches on a Regular Basis; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships to Depart for Rangoon and Bangkok for Loading

### Tax Revenue Increased Sharply in May, Breaking All Previous Records; Over 200 Billion Deficit Expected After Salaries Paid Out in June

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The financial revenue and expenditure situation of Shanghai in May has been fully compiled by the Finance Bureau. The revenue was over 849.2 billion yuan, and the expenditure was over 685.1 billion yuan. After offsetting the revenue and expenditure, the surplus reached over 164.1 billion yuan, breaking all previous records of the Finance Bureau. However, Director Tian told reporters yesterday that the sharp increase in tax revenue in May was actually the result of the Bureau's full efforts to collect taxes. Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, all units had to pay salaries in advance, so they had to save money in advance. However, after the salaries are paid out in June, a deficit of over 200 billion yuan is expected. Among the revenue items in May, business tax accounted for the largest portion, at over 290 billion yuan, followed by entertainment tax, at over 86.5 billion yuan, banquet tax again, at over 58.3 billion yuan, and slaughter tax at approximately 25.2 billion yuan.

### City Government Continues to Inquire on Eight Points, Jiaotong University Prepares to Reply Within Days; Student Union Hosted Reporters Yesterday

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The City Government is dissatisfied with Jiaotong University's response to the school's student demonstration on June 5, "Opposing the United States Supporting Japan," and has sent another letter to Jiaotong University, inquiring on eight points. Jiaotong University formally received the City Government's official letter yesterday morning. According to President Cheng Xiaogang, he has turned it over to the relevant departments for handling and will reply to the City Government within days.

The Jiaotong University Student Union hosted reporters last night, responding to Mayor Wu's remarks about Jiaotong University the day before. They also published "An Open Letter to Mayor Wu" and "A Letter to the Elders of the Nation," questioning the mayor on ten points.

The content of Jiaotong University's first response to the City Government's inquiry is supplemented as follows:

### Contents of Jiaotong University's Reply

Jiaotong University's reply to the City Government: We have received your official letter (Ji Shen Zi No. 4431) issued on June 5 of this year regarding the student-initiated class strike and demonstration case, instructing us to investigate and report on various points, which we should comply with. We have ordered the school's Dean of Students Office to strictly inquire with the student union representatives in accordance with the opinions in your letter. We have now received a written report from the student union, and excerpts of the responses to each point are as follows:

(1) Who requested action from the department representatives' conference beforehand?

Answer: In the department representatives' conference, sixteen classes (Electrical Engineering 3, Electrical Management 3, Chemistry 3, Physics 1, Transportation 3A, Transportation 3B, Transportation 1, Transportation 2A, Mechanical Engineering 2, Civil Engineering 4, Textile 2, Civil Engineering 3A, Hydraulic Engineering 2, Industrial Engineering 1, Industrial Engineering 2, Construction 4) formally spoke and requested action, and the result was passed (records are available). The so-called action refers to general, broad action, including sending telegrams, issuing declarations, expanding publicity and demonstrations, etc., and does not specifically refer to demonstrations.

(2) Who advocated for a class strike and demonstration in the department representatives' conference?

Answer: In the department representatives' conference, five classes (Chemistry 3, Industrial Engineering 1, Transportation 3A, Electrical Engineering 3, Transportation 2A) formally spoke and proposed a demonstration, and the result was passed. There was no discussion of a class strike (records are available).

(3) Who proposed eating together at 11:00 AM and gathering on the Bund at 1:00 PM in the department representatives' conference?

Answer: Having a meal at 11:00 AM (not eating together) was decided by the joint meeting of the student union and the National Jiaotong University Committee Against the United States Supporting Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis, and it was not decided to gather on the Bund at 1:00 PM.

(4) The department representatives' conference started at 3:00 PM and ended at 5:00 PM. When was contact made with the 120 organizations in this city to decide to depart at the same time and gather on the Bund?

(5) If contact was made after the vote at 5:00 PM, what method was used to contact the 120 organizations so quickly? (This is an impossible fact).

Answer: At the May Fourth bonfire party jointly held by 120 schools in Shanghai, the "Shanghai Federation Against the United States Supporting Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis" was established. Later, at the May 22 memorial meeting, it was decided that each school would take active action and set a date for the demonstration. However, participation was to be decided by each school independently. The department representatives' conference of our school was convened based on the call of the Federation and the request of more than 600 students who signed their names.

(6) If contact was made with the organizations to take joint action before the department representatives' conference, who represented Jiaotong University? Where and with whom was contact made?

Answer: Before the department representatives' conference, no contact was made with other schools (not organizations) to take joint action in this demonstration. Before the establishment of the Anti-American and Support Japan Crisis Committee of our school, there was no fixed person to participate on behalf of the student union. It was handled by the staff member who had no class at the time (contacting the anti-American and support Japan committees of other schools).

(7) What are the names of the 120 organizations? Who is in charge?

Answer: The name of the 120 organizations is the "Shanghai Student Federation Against the United States Supporting Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis." The chair is taken by each school in turn. According to the student report, the names of the 118 schools are all major and secondary schools in this city, and they stated that only a small number of students participated and could not represent the entire body. Our school believes that since this report cannot determine the participating school units, it is not appropriate to relay it to avoid damaging the reputation of other schools and causing our school to bear unnecessary responsibility. In response to the previous letter, we are now sending a letter with the results of the investigation, hoping that you will take appropriate action. Sincerely, Cheng Xiaogang, President of Jiaotong University.

### A Virtuous Man Who Donated a Ship Lives in a Tiny Room, Ten Years of Poverty and Illness with Intermittent Meals; People from All Walks of Life Send Letters to Pay Their Respects

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Wang Zhongying, who lives in a dilapidated attic in Hong'anfang on Shaanxi South Road, has become a legendary figure since unconditionally donating the Xin'an, a ship worth US$100,000. He is an object of visits by people from all walks of life. People from all walks of life, such as primary school students, civil servants, Christians, Buddhists, and soldiers, have sent letters to pay their respects to him. Someone from Pu Yi Road, who has suffered greatly from family disputes, is said to have recently visited Wang in person and intends to unconditionally donate his private property. When the reporter met with Wang, he expressed his gratitude for the comfort from all walks of life and said that he would be especially happy if more people could follow his example. The Qingdao Yingji Shipping Company and the Shanghai Office are currently being liquidated by Wang Youji. All approximately 11 or 12 employees will be given generous severance pay. Hu Baosan, the deputy manager of the company, has recently come to Shanghai from Qingdao to discuss everything. All crew members on the Xin'an will be retained by the Ying Jizi Charity Fund Preservation Committee and paid their salaries as usual. The shipping business has been decided to be handled by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Wang then told the reporter in detail about his life, saying that he founded Yingji Shipping Company in Qingdao in 1927. When Shen Honglie was the mayor of Qingdao, he served as the accounting director of the port authority and the executive director of the shipping association. Later, in Shanghai, he also acted as an insurance and transportation agent for more than 30 British giant ships, and he was one of the giants in the shipping industry at the time. Unfortunately, when the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, he was arrested by the Japanese military police in Qingdao, imprisoned for seven days, and subjected to flogging and poisoning. Later, he was released on bail and fled to Shanghai. All his ships and property were lost. For more than ten years, he has been living in the current attic, suffering from poverty and illness, and sometimes even struggling to get three meals a day. After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company returned the Xin'an, he still intended to revive his old business. He spent money to repair the ship and restore the company. However, because the ship was repeatedly used for military transportation and business was difficult, the debt reached approximately 2.4 billion yuan by the end of last year. In addition, he was weak and ill, and people were shallow and made things worse, and family stimuli only increased. For these several reasons, he had long planned to transfer this external thing to public use. This led to the donation of the ship on the 7th of this month.

Repeated Family Tragedies, Full of Suffering in the World

Regarding Wang's family situation, according to him, his great-grandfather served as the prefect of Sichuan, and his grandfather was also a fourth-rank prefect. At that time, he and Ding Ruchang and others were sworn brothers in the north, and had a very deep friendship with Li Hongzhang. Throughout his life, he did his best to engage in charitable undertakings. During the great famine in Xianhaiwei in a certain year of Guangxu, he used 3,000 taels of silver to provide disaster relief. Wang's father also had fame in the Qing Dynasty. It was only when Wang himself started working outside. He currently has two younger brothers, both of whom are currently in Qingdao, and four sisters, one in Dalian, one in Fuzhou, and one still in the communist area. His second sister is 65 years old and is the sister-in-law of Bi Shucheng. She recently fled from the communist area, alone and with all her family property gone. After Wang himself got married, he divorced due to disagreements. Later, he married another woman and adopted a child each, but before they reached adulthood, they both died one after another. His wife, due to excessive stimulation, has shaved her head and become a nun. Therefore, although Wang is only 53 years old, he has already experienced all the suffering in the world, and he has reached a state of utter despair.

Mayor Wu previously asked Wang to recuperate at the Municipal Hospital, but he has hired another doctor for treatment. It is said that he has diseases of the intestines, stomach, lungs, and brain. He needs treatment by experts and long-term recuperation will not be effective. He told reporters that if he can cure his illness in a few months, he is very willing to volunteer for the Ying Jizi Charity Fund Preservation Committee. Otherwise, he will find a temple to be his destination.

### Communist Bandits Discovered Among Returning Refugees Arrested While Trying to Escape in Nanjing and Interrogated, Remaining Accomplices Arrested Based on Confessions

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent a group of refugees from Guanyun County, Northern Jiangsu, back to their hometowns on May 26th. The refugees arrived at the Nanjing riverbank late the following night. One of them, Qi Gang, attempted to leave the group and escape, but was discovered by Inspector Xiong Xinquan of the Railway Bureau's Jiangbian Police Station, who arrested him and transferred him to the Beijing-Tianjin Police Section of the Beijing Station for interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Zhang Kun, a 26-year-old native of Suqian, and he is one of the communist bandits assigned to be in charge of activities on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. In the spring of 1944, he joined the communist bandit "Youth National Salvation Association," received training twice, and successively held important positions such as the Minister of Organization and the City Work Cadre of the North Suqian District of the Seventh District of the "Su皖 Border Region Government." This time, he was ordered to infiltrate the 23rd Division of the National Army stationed in Jingjiang, Northern Jiangsu, to secretly incite rebellion. Fearing that he would be discovered after a long time, he fled to Shanghai, mingled with the refugee team, and applied for repatriation, intending to return to the communist bandit headquarters in Northern Huai to report. Wang Zhaohuai, the director of the Railway Bureau's police department, considered Zhang to have held important positions in the bandit army and must be very familiar with the bandits lurking on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. He telegraphed Shi Yuandi, the section chief of the Beijing-Tianjin Section, to interrogate him in detail. As a result, he confessed to the plans of the treacherous bandit Qi Gang to disrupt order and endanger traffic safety, and admitted that there were accomplices lurking and operating in several cities and towns along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. In addition to transferring Zhang to the competent authorities, the Railway Bureau also followed the clues provided by Zhang and went to the addresses to arrest the remaining accomplices.

### Dragon and Phoenix Dances on the River, Drums Beat Loudly, Flags Seized in the Waves

[Report from Our Newspaper] After a week of active preparations and practice by the ferry industry, the Dragon Boat Festival finally officially appeared on the Huangpu River on a day with bright sun, high winds, and pomegranate flowers like fire. Because most shops were closed for the holiday, tens of thousands of citizens came to watch, crowding the Bund Park and the banks of the Huangpu River. Small rowing boats did brisk business, soliciting customers to go to the river to sightsee, resulting in countless boats and sails filling the river. The Water Police Bureau dispatched several patrol boats to patrol back and forth. Five "Dragon Nests" were erected from Waibaidu Bridge to Yangjiadu Wharf, each connected by multiple large ships, serving as temporary command platforms. Flags were displayed, and incense smoke swirled. Eleven dragon and phoenix boats began circling these five "Dragon Nests" at 7:00 AM, each boat's movements coordinated and orderly according to the drumbeat. There was also a person on the bow of each boat performing a costumed dance. More than a dozen merchant ships, including the Qitong, Feiyan, Haiping, and Jianghan, which were docked in the Huangpu River, set off firecrackers when the dragon boats passed by to express their welcome. Many gorgeously dressed women in the audience competed to tie large banknotes to eggshells and throw them into the river. The crew members of each boat, upon seeing this, bravely jumped into the water, freely maneuvering back and forth in the turbulent waves to compete for the money. Their swimming skills earned them much applause. After 12:00 noon, the boats lined up and sailed back to the Dawang Temple on Suzhou Creek to rest. At 3:00 PM, they paddled back onto the river to perform again. The dragons and phoenixes raised their heads and tails, and cheers were heard wherever the boats passed. Because the municipal ferry workers went on strike yesterday and thousands of ferry workers along the coast were also off for the holiday, the water carnival did not end until after 7:00 PM.

### Four Injured in Brawl at Fuan Amusement Park, Principal Culprit at Large and Being Pursued

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fuan Amusement Park at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Dongmen Road was originally scheduled to open yesterday. The night before last, when the park's General Manager Chen Daqi ordered more than 200 employees to burn red candles on the stage on the second floor to worship the gods, a conflict arose between Chen and the manager, Li Renyuan (also a shareholder), over the matter of recommending employees. Chen instructed his son, Ziqin, to go out and gather dozens of hooligans to come and cause trouble, ordering them to stay on the sixth floor. Li firmly defended the second floor. At 2:00 AM yesterday, the two sides gathered hundreds of people, each holding sharp blades and iron hooks, and engaged in a major brawl. After the Yimiao Police Sub-bureau was notified, it ordered police officers to rush to suppress the brawl. At the same time, the Municipal Police Bureau was also notified and dispatched flying fortresses to rush to the scene, breaking open the front and back doors. Most of the perpetrators had already escaped over the wall. Four suspects, Chen Xinlin, Li Guilin, Li Qingzheng, Liang Xinshi, and others, were arrested on the spot and taken to the station for interrogation. The injured, Zhuang A'gen (31 years old), Shen A'fa (18 years old), and manager Li Renyuan (28 years old), were all taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. The principal culprit, Chen Daqi, is at large and being pursued. The Fuan Amusement Park, which was scheduled to reopen yesterday, was therefore unable to do so.

### The Gold Control Bureau has Established Strict Management Methods to Prevent Banks and Businesses from Issuing Promissory Notes Indiscriminately Yesterday, It Also Summoned the Bankers, Money Changers, and Trust Companies Associations to Study How to Reduce the Circulation of Promissory Notes

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of the ban on using promissory notes as collateral, the number of promissory notes issued by banks and businesses on the market has suddenly increased. In order to prevent banks and businesses from issuing empty promissory notes indiscriminately, increasing the risk to credit, and affecting price fluctuations, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau has sent out ten groups of auditors since last Saturday to inspect the issuance of promissory notes by various banks and businesses. At the same time, it has established strict management methods and issued a notice to the Bankers, Money Changers, and Trust Companies Associations to comply. It is understood that these methods are:

(1) The issuance of a promissory note, if requested by a customer, must be based on the customer having a balance in their account or exchanging it for cash, and should be issued at the time of the transaction. Promissory notes must not be given to customers in advance.

(2) After a promissory note is received, it should be immediately transferred and canceled, and not be held in the treasury or used as collateral to pay other customers.

(3) All promissory notes issued by banks and businesses, in addition to paying their own taxes, should be limited to customer requests. Regardless of the purpose of the promissory note, the balance of the promissory note account that day must have sufficient funds deposited in the treasury, the central bank's clearinghouse, or other banks.

(4) If a bank or business violates the above regulations regarding the issuance of promissory notes and is found to be true by the Gold Control Bureau, it will be severely punished.

[Another Dispatch] In order to reduce the circulation of promissory notes and prevent credit expansion, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau invited the responsible persons of the city's Bankers, Money Changers, and Trust Companies Associations to a meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday for discussions. It is reported that the content of the discussions focused on how to reduce the circulation of promissory notes as much as possible under the principle of prohibiting their use as collateral. Two principles were decided: (1) Promote certified checks to replace promissory notes, and (2) According to regulations, legitimate factories can carefully negotiate collateral contracts with banks and businesses. The three associations will convene a meeting immediately to formulate implementation measures based on these two principles.

(10) Private trading of foreign exchange certificates will inevitably lead to market chaos, affecting the projected costs of export goods. It is best to have a public market with daily price listings to ensure uniformity.

(11) The transfer of foreign exchange certificates should not be restricted by region. For example, if Region A has a surplus and Region B has a deficit, the foreign exchange certificates from Region A should be allowed to be transferred in Region B. However, the transfer period of seven days is too short and should be extended. However, if the extension is too long, there may be speculation and manipulation. It seems that two weeks would be more appropriate.

(12) The transfer of foreign exchange certificates should be limited to one time only. That is, after the exporter or overseas remittance recipient sells the foreign exchange certificate they received to the importer, the importer should not resell this certificate to a third party, in order to prevent importers with strong financial resources from buying and reselling in large quantities, manipulating the market, and seeking exorbitant profits.

(13) It is best to issue import licenses in three installments per quarter, that is, the quarterly quota is divided into three months to issue licenses. Importers can settle foreign exchange for one-third of the quota each month. The reasons are as follows: Currently, the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method has indeed increased exports, but the increase is gradual. The foreign exchange certificates obtained by exporters will not increase excessively in each month. When the quota is announced, importers will find it more beneficial to settle foreign exchange early, which will inevitably lead to a rush to buy certificates. Because of the large quantity, the supply will inevitably fall short of demand. Only importers with strong financial resources and strong activity can meet their needs. Factories with slightly weaker financial resources will inevitably be left out. Although the Central Bank can issue special certificates to regulate the market, the foreign exchange certificates required by each importer for the quarterly quota are satisfied in the first month, then the demand will be greatly reduced or unnecessary in the second and third months. If so, the price of foreign exchange certificates in the second and third months will plummet, and exporters will suffer great losses. Therefore, for the sake of market stability, it is advisable to issue import licenses and settle foreign exchange on a monthly basis for each quarterly quota.

(14) When the supply of foreign exchange certificates exceeds demand, the Central Bank should buy them at the highest price. When demand exceeds supply, it should increase the supply to prevent speculation and price gouging, otherwise both importers and exporters will inevitably suffer losses, causing import and export trade to fall into chaos.

(15) Exporters can increase their own funds because exporting is profitable, so the government loans they need can be reduced. However, it takes a long time to purchase goods from the place of origin and transport them to the export port, so there is still a need for capital turnover. Therefore, packing loans must still be handled in the future and cannot be stopped.

(16) Promoting exports can improve the national economy, especially for the vast rural areas. In the past, due to layer-by-layer exploitation by intermediaries, direct producers were still in difficulty, and only a few intermediaries obtained huge profits, which ran counter to the purpose of improving the national economy. In the future, relevant authorities should jointly study solutions to ensure that export benefits can benefit direct producers as much as possible, and not be exclusively enjoyed by a few people.

(17) Regarding the foreign exchange settlement methods for overseas remittances: 1. Efforts should be made to simplify the procedures; 2. Efforts should be made to ensure that the difference between the proceeds from the sale of overseas remittance certificates and the market price is close to the market price. The problems in this are complex and the competent authorities should conduct detailed research on the methods to facilitate implementation, so as to achieve the practical effect of attracting overseas remittances.

Literature and History

### "Preface to Fu Tang Ci" - A Tentative Interpretation

— Cheng Huichang

Tan Xian is an excellent writer among the Ci poets of the Qing Dynasty. This is known to all. His "Fu Tang Ci" has a very short preface. The full text is:

Zhou Meicheng said: "Flowing water hinders chariot warfare." He also said: "Damp clothes waste furnace smoke." Xin You'an said: "I don't know how much my strength has declined, but I only feel lazy to go upstairs lately." Those who fill in Ci, try to find out the gist of it from this. I have been fond of learning for thirty years, and have slightly mastered writing. I am deeply ashamed, both great and small, even of composing Ci. My fellow villager, Xiang Sheng (whose name is Hongzu, courtesy name Liansheng, and has "Yi Yun Ci"), believes: "If you don't do things that are of no benefit, how can you spend a limited life?" His words are critical, but he only knows two and five, but does not know ten. Tan Xian wrote.

This preface has no date. However, according to Tan's own preface to "Fu Tang Ci Lu"—an anthology from the Tang to the Ming Dynasties—he said:

I started learning poetry at the age of fifteen. At twenty-two... I began to write Ci. ... After thirty, I examined its various schools. ... After forty, I became more aware that ancient music seemed to be in the Yuefu, and the remainder of Yuefu was in Ci. ... At the age of fifty, my view was finally settled.

Comparing the "thirty years of joyful learning" in the Ci preface with "my view was finally settled at the age of fifty" in the Ci Lu preface, the opinion in the short article above is undoubtedly his "final conclusion in his later years" on Ci.

However, the meaning of the Ci preface is quite vague. First, he extracted four lines from three Ci poems by Zhou and Xin, believing that people should use these examples to understand the message of composing Ci. What exactly do these four lines of Ci represent? Second, he believes that Xiang Liansheng's two sentences only state one side of the matter, while his words occupy the other side. If they cannot be connected, it means "knowing two and five but not knowing ten." So, where is the difference between this "two and five" and "ten"?

The purpose of this article is to attempt to provide a speculative answer to these two points. For convenience, I will first transcribe the full text of the three Ci poems below:

Zhou Meicheng "Spring Rain"

Facing the overnight smoke, the spring birds are quiet, and the flying rain sometimes soaks the tall house. The green jade banners on the wall, all washed of their leaden frost, the tender shoots touch each other. Moisture presses against the zither strings, cold invades the pillow screen, and spider webs stick to the bamboo curtains. In the deserted post pavilion, listening to the endless sound of the eaves, I fall into a light sleep. But sorrow startles me greatly, dreams are hard to remember, and I pity my solitude. The travelers' desire to return is urgent, and the first thought is that the flowing water hinders the chariot wheels. How can I bear to see Lan Cheng haggard and Wei Jie thin, and easily hurt my eyes at leisure? No wonder the Pingyang guest, tears fall, in the mournful melody of the flute. Moreover, in this desolate land of green weeds. Red grains cover the ground, and thorny peach trees outside the door are like beans. Who will hold a candle for night tours?

Zhou Meicheng "Man Ting Fang" (Composed at Wu Xiang Mountain in Lishui on a Summer Day)

The wind ages the oriole chicks, the rain fattens the plums, and the midday shade of the beautiful trees is clear and round. The land is low and close to the mountain, and damp clothes waste furnace smoke. People are quiet, and crows and kites enjoy themselves, outside the small bridge, the new green splashes. Leaning on the railing for a long time, the yellow reeds and bitter bamboo make me suspect that I am floating on a boat on the Nine Rivers. Every year, like a swallow returning to its nest, I drift on the vast sea and come to roost in a tall elm tree. Let's not think about things outside ourselves, but stay close to the wine bottle. I am a haggard guest weary of Jiangnan, unable to bear listening to hurried pipes and complicated strings. Beside the singing banquet, first settle the pillow, and let me sleep when I am drunk.

Xin You'an "Zhe Gu Tian" (Composed After Recovering from Illness on Returning to Goose Lake)

I put down my pen, the stream hall is cold and wants to close, the broken clouds rely on the water and are collected in the evening. The red lotuses lean on each other as if drunk, and the white gulls are silent and must be worried. The book says "duo duo," but let it rest. A hill and a gully are also romantic. I don't know how much my strength has declined, but I only feel lazy to go upstairs lately.

Tan's opinions on Ci are scattered in his essays and diaries, but his comments on Zhou Zheng'an's Ci debate are more important. In his comments on the Ci debate, his opinion on the line "travelers" in Zhou Ci's "Da Pu" is:

Also the tears of Xinting.

His opinion on the line "The land is low" in "Man Ting Fang" is:

I feel that "Li Sao" is twenty-five, and the person who left is not far away.

He did not comment on Xin Ci's work. Judging from the two comments on Zhou Ci, it is still impossible to directly use them to explain the Ci preface, because the words are too simple, making it impossible for people to immediately associate the story of Xinting and the ancient book "Chu Ci" with how to "find out the gist of it." Therefore, to solve this mystery, we must return to the Ci itself and start by analyzing their modes of expression.

Speaking of Ci as Ci, the lines Tan mentioned clearly depict the scenes in these three poems. "Spring Rain," as the title suggests, describes the spring rain. The first part describes what the author heard, saw, and felt after being awakened by the sound of rain in the guest house—both physiological and psychological. The second part describes the difficulty of returning home due to the loneliness in the middle of the journey. "The travelers' desire to return is urgent" is a statement of fact about the past and present; "Flowing water hinders chariot warfare" is about the future, based on imagination. Because of the eagerness to return home, as soon as he hears the rain, he immediately has thoughts of mud on the road, blocked wheels, and the inability to travel. "Man Ting Fang" is a feeling of a "tired guest from Jiangnan" throughout the poem. Generally, the first part describes the scenery, and the second part describes the emotions. The description of the scenery is both real and imaginary, and should be distinguished. For example, "yellow reeds and bitter bamboo" are real, while "floating on a boat on the Nine Rivers" is imaginary, merely using the allusion of Bai Letian's "Pipa Xing." "The land is low and close to the mountain" is also real, while "damp clothes waste furnace smoke" may not have actually happened at the time. The function of this sentence is nothing more than to supplement the description of the low-lying area in the previous sentence. Because the following talks about "leaning on the railing," "before the wine bottle," and "beside the singing banquet," which are consistent with the events at the time. The author would never, and should not, suddenly be busy taking time to dry his clothes while drinking and listening to music. As for "Zhe Gu Tian," it is a poignant mood displayed by a late hero in a plain life. The depression of this old fighter who exchanged "ten thousand words to pacify the Rong" for "planting trees in the east family" is very clear. In this Ci poem, it is certainly not because he occasionally feels strenuous going upstairs that he suddenly realizes that his strength has declined. He may not have even had the idea of going upstairs when composing the Ci. It is only from "strength declining" that he thought of being "lazy to go upstairs."

If what I have said above is not too far from the author's original intention, then we can summarize a common point from the modes of expression of the lines mentioned by Tan. That is, they all adopt a layered way of thinking. Has the "flowing water" already "hindered" the "chariot warfare"? No, it hasn't. It's just because there is rain that he thought of "flowing water hindering chariot warfare." Have the "damp clothes" already "wasted" the "furnace smoke"? No, it hasn't. It's just because the land is low and wet that he thought of "damp clothes wasting furnace smoke." Has he ever "gone" "upstairs"? No, he hasn't. It's just because his "strength" has "declined" that he thought of being "lazy" to "go upstairs."

Then, further, we want to ask: Why does Tan value this kind of method so much? That involves his view of Ci. Since Zhang Fuwen's "Ci Selection" respected the Ci style and regarded Ci as being of equal value to the "Book of Songs" and "Chu Ci," the so-called gentleness, sincerity, loyalty, and affection became the highest standards for writing and discussing Ci. Zhou Zhi'an's "Entrustment" theory and Chen Yifeng's "Melancholy" theory are all aftereffects of Zhang's theory. There are slight differences between them, but they are generally consistent. At that time, this theory can be said to have been popular for a generation. Tan was born after Zhang and Zhou, and at the same time as Yifeng, and was a figure in that environment. His preface to "Fu Tang Ci Lu" discusses the purpose of Ci, saying:

The highest is expressing aspirations and eternal words, the second is pure aspirations and fragrant deeds, and then it converges on elegance and refinement.

This is completely the same viewpoint as the Changzhou school. Taking gentleness, sincerity, loyalty, and affection as the standard for literature originates from the rationalistic thought of Confucianism, that is, the so-called way of loyalty and forgiveness. Loyalty is doing one's best, and forgiveness is extending oneself to others, which is the expansion of empathy. In psychological development and textual expression, pushing from this to that, and thinking from another's perspective, is a further step in thinking and a concrete display of empathy. This method can replace others in thinking, or it can be just thinking about oneself. One can think of others from oneself, think of the past or future from the present, think of that place from this place, or completely reverse the process. The following examples all belong to this type:

Du Zimei "Moonlit Night"

Tonight, the moon in Fuzhou, I am the only one watching in Zhongzhou.

Fang Xugu "Double Ninth Festival"

The mountain rain has just cleared and I look out, I expect I don't have the strength to climb.

Liu Shuqing "Eight-Tone Ganzhou"

I imagine the beautiful woman gazing from her boudoir, mistaking the returning boat on the horizon many times.

Xin You'an "Touching the Fish"

I always fear the flowers will bloom early in spring.

Therefore, in the eyes of people who generally respect the Ci style, this method is not only a technique in itself, a technique to increase the depth and breadth of emotion, but also a direct proof of gentleness, sincerity, loyalty, and affection. Because it can enable the work to achieve the lofty effect expected by the author. The three examples Tan mentioned happen to all be of this type of layered thinking, no wonder he wrote it solemnly as a "final conclusion in his later years" and taught "those who fill in Ci to try to find out the gist of it from this." Regarding this speculation, Tan's own Ci poems also provide references. For example:

Su Mu Zhe

Peach blossoms on the road, withering first inside the door.

Jiao Zhao (Lotus Flower)

Wanting to be as long-lived as the clouds in the mountains, paddling to pick water chestnuts, with many thorns hurting my hand.

Yi Jiu You (The title is too long, omitted.)

Autumn coolness reduces beautiful thoughts, I imagine it is like a Buddhist monk's room by the water, dampening my clothes.

Linjiang Xian (Remembering Parting)

Tear stains want to write a blush on my face, I endure it silently, fearing to stain the roadside flowers.

These all share the same idea as the preface and the ones I mentioned earlier. It can be seen that Tan not only knew this meaning, but also combined knowledge and action. As for the words "tears of Xinting" and "Li Sao is twenty-five, and the person who left is not far away" in the Ci debate, they are using metaphor and allegory to discuss Ci, believing that what Zhou Ci said about human affairs is also about national affairs. That is, what Tan said in the preface to "Fu Tang Ci Lu":

The author's intention may not necessarily be so, but why must the reader's intention not be so.

It seems to be two different things from what is mentioned in the Ci preface. When it comes to metaphor and gentleness and sincerity, the relationship is naturally very close. However, this article cannot involve that.

Now, let's talk about another point, the difference between Tan and Xiang's opinions. As mentioned earlier, Tan's Ci theory is based on the Changzhou school, and they view the status of Ci as very lofty. Xiang, on the other hand, considers it a "useless thing" to "spend a limited life," in other words, only acknowledging it as a form of leisure entertainment. This is naturally something Tan cannot agree with. Moreover, there is still a complex process in the techniques of how to achieve gentleness, sincerity, loyalty, and affection, which cannot be obliterated with just a few words of "useless thing." Therefore, although Tan knows that Xiang's words are "critical words" from a heartbroken person with other feelings, he cannot help but think that he only knows "two and five" but does not know "ten."

### Postscript to the Tang Manuscript of Sun Mian's Tang Yun (Remaining Pages)

— Zhou Zumuo

These remaining pages of the Tang manuscript of the rhyme book are stored in the National Library of France in Paris, obtained by Paul Pelliot from Dunhuang. Pelliot's number is 2018. The original was a scroll, but only the fourteen lines of the East, Winter, and Zhong rhymes remain. Judging from the script, it was written by someone after the mid-Tang Dynasty. Although there is no book title or author's surname, the characters used for the fanqie (pronunciation guide) mostly disagree with the books of Lu Fayan and Wang Renxu. For example, the Winter rhyme has "Bin Cang Zong fan," but the Changsun Jian Annotation of Lu Yun (that is, the second kind of Wang's manuscript Qieyun) and the two Wang Yun versions with Xiang's postscript and Song's postscript stored in the Palace Museum both use "Zai Zong fan"; also "Zhi Rong fan," Changsun's book and Wang Yun use "You Zhi Long fan"; "Xiang Li Dong fan," Changsun's book and Wang Yun use "Li Zong fan"; "Zong Zuo Dong fan," Changsun's book uses "Zuo Zong fan," and Wang Yun uses "Zuo Cong fan"; "Rong Yi Gong fan," Changsun's book and Wang Yun use "Yu Feng fan"; all these disagree. According to its system, it is actually consistent with the Tang Yun formerly collected by Jiang Fu, so it can be determined as Sun Mian's book. Why do I say that? Now I will list five things as evidence:

(1) The annotations of the first character of each rhyme head in this fragment are all explanations listed first, and the fanqie is listed later, which is consistent with Tang Yun.

(2) This book collects quite a few characters in each rhyme head. For all newly added characters, the rhyme head is called "Ji Jia Ji," and each newly added character is individually noted, the system is very detailed and thorough, which is exactly the same as Tang Yun. For example, under "Long" it says: "Li Zhong fan, seven plus three," and the words "Jing Ji Long" below are all individually marked with the word "Jia." Tang Yun also has many such examples in the Wei rhyme under "Yu": "Xu Ji fan, six plus two," and the words "Kai Qi" below are also like that. There is no need to list all of them, this is enough to prove that the two books have the same system.

(3) Sun Mian's Tang preface has the words "As for foreign anecdotes, strange legends, origins of surnames, local products, mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, insects, and fish, all are recorded in detail with evidence and compiled according to rhyme." Now the annotations in this book are quite complex, broadly citing various books as evidence, and are particularly detailed on surnames and geography, which is even more consistent with Sun's preface. Moreover, the books cited are also the same as in Jiang Fu's Tang Yun. For example, in the fragment, "Xi" is cited from Huainanzi, "Fu" below says "From Exotic Objects," "Dong" below says "Also a surname, Dong Shou, Left Sima of Murong Huang of the Former Yan," this comes from the Former Yan Record. Also, "Hu" below cites Character Styles, "Chun" below cites Shiben, "Song" below cites Mysterious Records, the words "Bin Ling" below cite Guangya, and the words "Peng Feng Song Nan" below cite Shuowen, the breadth of its collection can be generally seen. And in Jiang's Tang Yun, "Mu" under the Twilight rhyme cites the Former Yan Record, "Yan" under the Xian rhyme cites Character Styles, "Can" under the Zhun rhyme cites Huainanzi, and "Na" under the He rhyme cites Exotic Objects, etc., the books cited are also the same. It is very clear that the two must come from the hand of the same person.

(4) Guangyun notes under the word "Gong" in the third Zhong rhyme: "Lu used Gong Zong Cong etc. to enter the Winter rhyme, which is wrong," Mr. Wang Jing'an has determined that this is the old text of Tang Yun (see Guantang Jilin Volume 8, Postscript to the Tang Manuscript Tang Yun collected by Jiang in Wu County), then the transfer of these three rhymes to the Zhong rhyme began with Sun Mian. Now, although the "Nong" rhyme under the Winter rhyme of this fragment is incomplete, compared with Changsun's book, the words under this should be the "Nong" rhyme and the "Gong" rhyme, and there are no longer the three rhymes of Gong Zong Cong. And the "Rong" character of these three Zhong rhymes, the sound is "Yi Gong fan," using the "Gong" character as the pronunciation guide, can especially prove that the three rhymes of Gong Zong Cong have been included in the Zhong rhyme; which is consistent with Mr. Jing'an's words.

(5) This fragment "Zhi Xi Zang Zong," the sound of "Zong" is "Zuo Dong," which does not agree with Changsun's book and Wang Yun, but agrees with both Da Xu's Shuowen and Xiao Xu's Shuowen Zhuan Yun Pu ten-volume version. Da Xu has clearly stated that the sound he determined is based on Sun Mian, so this fragment must be the same book as the Tang Yun on which Da Xu was based. Only the sound of this "Rong" character is "Yi Gong fan," while Da Xu's Shuowen makes it "Yu Feng fan," which is slightly different.

With these five pieces of evidence, this manuscript is undoubtedly Sun Mian's Tang Yun. Previously, Mr. Jing'an said that the note under "Gong" in Guangyun was the old text of Tang Yun, which was originally a speculative statement, but now, unexpectedly, in this fragment, its corroborating evidence was obtained, this is what is called the difficulty of expecting things and the fact that they often happen morning and evening. Then, although these are only a few dozen lines, they are also precious.

### Correction of Errors in the "Chronological Biography of Zhang Shizhai"

— Yao Jingcun & Hu Shi

Dear Mr. Shizhi:

Your old work from more than a decade ago, "Chronological Biography of Mr. Shizhai," is clear, concise, and truly a good book. Half a year ago, I browsed it once, and today I read it carefully from the beginning. On pages three to four of the main text of the chronological biography, within less than three hundred words, I found two places that can be discussed, and I would like to explain them to you. With your understanding, you should be able to understand my rudeness.

First, I will copy your original text:

Qianlong three years, Wu Wu (Western calendar 1738) Mr. born. (Ren Youzhi's Other Biography)

The previous year, Ding Si, Mr.'s father, Mr. Xiangqu, failed the provincial examination and resided in the home of his cousin Yuanye (Yun Gong). (The Deeds of Cousin Xun Ruren) Presumably he immediately returned to Shaoxing.

In this year, Mr.'s friend Ren Dachun (another name is Zhi) was born in Xinghua. (Ren's Other Biography) In this year, Mr.'s teacher Zhu Yun (Zhujun, Tonghe) was already ten years old. Famous people at the same time, Yuan Mei (Zicai) was already twenty-three years old. Qian Daxin (Xiaozheng, Xinmei) was eleven years old, and Dai Zhen (Dongyuan) was sixteen years old. Wan Jing (Zhenyi), a senior in eastern Zhejiang, was already eighty years old, and Quan Zuwang (Shaoyi, Xieshan) was thirty-four years old.

Qianlong four years, Ji Wei (1739)

Mr. two years old.

When he was two or three years old, his uncle Hengyi often carried him to the neighbor Zhu Old Man to ask for wine, which became a daily routine. (Preface to the Eightieth Birthday of the Tenth Uncle), so Mr. grew up to be good at drinking.

In this year, July, the Qing court completed the Ming History. The style of learning changed and became focused on the Four Books and literature. (Preface to the Anthology of Ye Hetu in the Donghua Record)

Qianlong five years, Geng Shen (1740)

Mr. three years old.

In this year, Cui Shu was born in Daming, and Zhao Yi was born in Yanghu.

The Qing court completed the Great Qing Unified Geography. (Preface to the Geography) Qianlong six years, Xin You (1741)

Mr. four years old.

In this year, Wan Jing died, at the age of eighty (there is no punctuation mark in the original book).

Within these four entries above, there are two points that can be discussed:

First: Regarding Wan Jing's age at death. In Qianlong three years, he was already eighty years old, so when he died in Qianlong six years, he should not still be eighty. This point may be a mistake by the printer. Your original manuscript should not be like this.

Second: Regarding Zhao Yi's year of birth. According to the above entries, Zhao Yi was born in Qianlong five years, two years younger than Shizhai and thirteen years younger than Qian Daxin. But Qian Daxin clearly said in the preface to the "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories":

"I (Daxin) have the same hobbies as Mr. (Zhao Yi), and I am two years younger than Mr."

It can be seen that Zhao Yi was two years older than Qian Daxin, so he would be thirteen years older than Shizhai. His year of birth should be Yongzheng four years, Bing Wu (Western calendar 1726), and should not be Qianlong five years when Shizhai was three years old. This inference differs from your statement by fifteen years, and you did not specify the source in the entry "Zhao Yi was born in Yanghu in Qianlong five years." I don't know which is correct?

If you could give me some guidance on the above two points, I would be extremely grateful. Also, the "Chronological Biography of Mr. Zhang Shizhai" that I read was published by the Commercial Press, the first edition after the national crisis in May of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories" that I read was printed by the World Book Company, the first edition in December of the 25th year of the Republic of China. I am including these details for your reference and comparison.

Respectfully wishing you well. Yao Jingcun (37, 5, 24)

Dear Mr. Jingcun:

Thank you for your instructions.

The Chronological Biography of Tong Shizhai was a tentative work I did more than twenty years ago. After it was published, I saw Mr. Liu Hanyi's engraved "Posthumous Writings of Zhang," which included "Biography of My Late Friend During Geng Xin." At that time, I wanted to revise this chronological biography. Later, a young scholar named Yao Mingda added newly discovered materials to my original book, which became the "Chronological Biography of Zhang Shizhai" that you saw. It was published under the names of both Hu Shi and Yao Mingda. (The original version in the 11th year of the Republic of China only used my name.)

After reading your letter, I opened my original book and realized that the errors you pointed out were all unintentional mistakes made by Mr. Yao Mingda when he revised the book. My original chronological biography only had Qianlong three years and Qianlong seven years. The records from Qianlong four years to six years in the middle were all added by Mr. Yao.

Below Qianlong three years, the sentence "Presumably he immediately returned to Shaoxing" was added by Mr. Yao. Also, the ages of Wan Jing and Quan Zuwang were also added by Mr. Yao. Wan Jing was born in the 16th year of Shunzhi, Ji Hai (1659), so in Qianlong three years (1738), he was eighty years old, and when he died in Qianlong six years (1741), he should have been eighty-three years old.

Qian Daxin was born on the seventh day of the first lunar month in the sixth year of Yongzheng (February 16, 1728), according to the epitaph written by Wang Chang. In Qianlong three years, Qian was eleven years old, which is correct.

Zhao Yi was born on the twenty-second day of the tenth lunar month in the fifth year of Yongzheng (December 4, 1727), so he was only two and a half months older than Qian Daxin. Qian's preface to the "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories," saying that he was two years younger than Zhao, seems to be a mistake. Perhaps "two years" is a mistaken transcription of "one or two months." Your calculation that Zhao Yi was born in Yongzheng four years is one year off. Mr. Yao Mingda probably mistook Yongzheng five years as Qianlong five years, hence the thirteen-year error.

Regarding Zhao's birth date, Sun Xingyan's epitaph does not record it. The complete collection is accompanied by a chronological biography of Qian You'ou Bei, which says that he was born on the twenty-second day of the tenth lunar month in the fifth year of Yongzheng, which matches the birthdates recorded in volumes 44 and 48 of the Ou Bei Poetry Collection. Therefore, Qian Daxin's preface saying that he was two years younger must be a mistake. This preface is not included in the Qian Yan Tang Anthology, so we don't have another edition to correct this "year" character.

Your reading is so meticulous, you can surely find more errors from Mr. Yao Mingda and me. Mr. Yao has now become an ancient person, I want to especially thank you.

### Shanghai-Qingpu Long-Distance Bus Company Responds to Reader Shi Yuanren's Question

Dear Sir, We have read reader Shi Yuanren's opinion in the "Social Service" column of your newspaper on the 9th of this month: "Believing that the fare of the Qingpu-Shanghai long-distance bus is too high, hoping that the company will realize its error." Since our company's restoration two years ago, all expenses have been minimized in order to use the remaining funds to repair the damaged roads from the past eight years, totaling nineteen bridges and twenty-three kilometers of gravel roads. We have also actively improved vehicle equipment. As for the fare, it is handled in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Highway Bureau (starting from May 11, the original fare is increased by 80%). Our company has moderately added 60% to maintain the cost of driving. As for raw materials, since the government does not supply foreign exchange at official prices, we have to seek them on the black market. Compared with state-owned enterprises, our difficulties are not the same. We are very willing to accept Mr. Shi's suggestions and hope that people from all walks of life will contribute more suggestions for our reference. Sincerely, Shanghai-Qingpu Long-Distance Bus Co., Ltd.

### Leisurely Pursuits on the International Stage

— Le Ying

"A spring not ideal for studying" has passed, and now is the time for "summer slumber is just right." Especially for the first class in the afternoon, the temptation of "just right for slumber" is particularly strong. If the teacher happens to be lecturing on Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism or 13th-century theology, then there probably won't be anyone who doesn't emulate Zai Yu's daytime nap. Writing this reminds me of an old story. It is said that a certain Mr. Wu, a mathematics teacher at a private middle school in Suzhou, was quite plump. One summer while teaching, he pointed to a math problem on the blackboard and asked a student to solve it. Before the student finished the calculation, the teacher was already leaning against the blackboard, sound asleep and snoring loudly.

The diplomats attending various United Nations conferences probably feel the same way as students having class in the sweltering summer heat. Meetings are held every day, and all they do is repeat the same old arguments. Not to mention the emptiness of the speeches, they are also endlessly long and require translation. After finally listening to a long tirade, the opposing side comes up with another long tirade. "Fatigue bombing" continues relentlessly, which is truly unbearable. Yet, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, they can neither slip out for a walk nor steal a nap.

And so, these solemn and dignified representatives pick up the pencils on the table and write, and write...

What exactly do they write?

A journalist wanted to answer this question. He exhausted all methods, contacting the representatives' staff, bribing the cleaning ladies, and went to great lengths to find a few of these drawings.

However, what is the meaning of these "doodles"? The journalist consulted a specialist in psychoanalysis - Dr. Werner Wolff, a renowned professor at Bard College. Below is Dr. Wolff's analysis.

Gromyko's incessant repetition of the same lines shows his extreme nervous tension, just like many people who constantly feel oppressed. He seems compelled to do something and feels he must do it again and again. As for the pair of thickly drawn eyes in the upper left corner, they indicate that Gromyko feels he cannot control many events himself. His responsibility is "observation," and observation requires eyes, so he draws these eyes with particular emphasis.

The Belarusian representative, Kiselev, in fact, always follows Gromyko's lead. However, the densely interwoven squares in this drawing indicate his fear. He fears that many units will break away, so he uses all means to connect them together. The many fine lines within the squares indicate his tension, anxiety, and fear. As for the "Yes" on the right side of the drawing, it depends on what was being discussed that day.

Vandenberg's "portrait" indicates that the author often drifts between daydreams and reality. The "person" in his drawing is very frightening, especially the glasses and the pair of eyes, which are quite magical. However, the handkerchief in the pocket and the gemstone on the tie indicate that he is quite powerful and likes to dress well. Vandenberg is indeed very wary of this kind of person. (According to the journalist who collected these "doodles," Vandenberg is the most enthusiastic doodler at various gatherings.)

Dulles drew snakes. Dr. Wolff said that although most people think of snakes as symbols of danger and aggression, the heads of these snakes are quite like gentle and elegant swans. It seems that the author is striving for peaceful coexistence, so he portrays the ferocious things in such a "benevolent manner."

Pichon's delicate and soft brushstrokes indicate that he is very sensitive, somewhat neurotic, prone to depression, and often anxious.

According to Dr. Wolff, Gu Shaochuan's calligraphy is "abstract and full of aesthetic concepts." He said that the person who wrote these characters must also focus on the abstract or the principles when handling affairs. But when we Chinese people look at it, we feel that the meaning of these characters is quite obvious. "Trouble," "Hypocrisy" - aren't these the most accurate comments on those diplomatic speeches? And Dr. Gu's meticulousness is revealed in these neat "hollowed-out characters"!

Finally, there is the United Nations Secretary-General, Trygve Lie. Dr. Wolff said that this paper has more words than drawings, indicating that this person likes to reason and does little. Dr. Wolff not only spoke about Lie's character but also about the characteristics of the United Nations organization he leads. In fact, if the United Nations were not such an organization that specializes in endless reasoning, then these many diplomats might not have had those leisurely pursuits to leave behind these "calligraphic treasures."

[In addition to verbal sparring, the representatives of the United Nations agencies occasionally scribble at will, which is quite interesting. The creators of these seven "masterpieces" are: (from right) (1) Former Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council, Andrei Gromyko; (2) Belarusian representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Kiselev; (3) United States representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Vandenberg; (4) United States representative to the United Nations, John Foster Dulles, who was scolded by Vyshinsky as a "warmonger"; (5) French Foreign Minister, Pichon; (6) Our country's ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun; (7) United Nations Secretary-General, Trygve Lie.

### Concerning Opium

— Bai Yong

Li Xiaochi of Jiangning's "A Brief Account of Opium Affairs" and another "Remembering the Pain" recording stories of the Taiping Rebellion are two immortal masterpieces. Although Jiangning was not the port of entry for opium, this first unequal treaty was signed here, shattering the two-thousand-year-old confidence of considering itself a celestial dynasty. It is fitting that Mr. Li wrote this account in anger.

Recently, I read Zhang Ruogu's compiled "Chronicle of Ma Xiangbo's Life," which quotes Chen Lesu's talk about his experiences at eighty years old: "I was born in the twentieth year of Daoguang. In the twenty-second year, the Opium War occurred, and the Treaty of Nanjing was signed with the British. I was just three years old. Near the north gate of the city wall in Zhenjiang, there was a barbershop. At that time, the custom was for everyone to take a water pipe and smoke water tobacco. One day, the barber, because he had no distinguished customers, took a water pipe and strolled up the city wall for a leisurely walk, with a paper torch between his fingers. Suddenly, he saw a cannon on the wall, loaded with gunpowder and fuse, but no soldiers guarding it. The barber suddenly became excited and casually lit the fuse with the paper torch in his hand. Before he knew it, there was a deafening explosion, scaring the barber to run away for his life. That year was the Opium War. The British soldiers were so fierce at that time, attacking Wusongkou, occupying Shanghai, and then attacking Zhenjiang. Just at that moment, a ship was anchored in the middle of the river when suddenly a cannonball grazed past the mast. The officers on the ship were greatly surprised and secretly thought that China was not to be trifled with, it was terrible, terrible, so they decided to head downstream... This was later told to me by my friend Yang Gushan, who was eight years older than me and witnessed it personally!"

If this kind of story were written into history, it would be like the "wind reversed, and all the grain rose up" in the "Golden Coffer" chapter of the Book of Documents, or like what Shi Kefa reported to Dorgon: "Tens of thousands of logs of Phoebe zhennan emerged from the Yangtze River to help build palaces," and "When the congratulatory message was raised, purple clouds covered the sky," all such tales of "heaven and man returning." Both Mr. Xiang and Mr. Yang were children at that time, so what they saw is not something we need to discuss for now. However, I always thought it was somewhat disrespectful that an eighty-year-old man still regarded it as credible history. The same book also quotes Mr. Liu Chengyu's "Record of Mr. Xiang's Knowledge and Oral Narratives at Ninety-Eight Years Old," which records Lin Zexu's defense at the seacoast: "At that time, Lin Zexu gained a reputation for being tough on foreign countries because he burned opium. In reality, he did not understand foreign affairs and ultimately caused maritime conflict. There is an interesting story about this campaign. Lin Zexu arranged large vats on the Guangzhou city wall, pretending they were giant cannons. British warships, using telescopes, thought that the great country of China must have military cannons, so they hesitated and retreated. At that time, Herdt and William, two British scholars studying in China who were fluent in Chinese, were practicing on warships. They said that China did not have such cannons, so they devised a plan to investigate. Under the moonlight, they secretly attacked with a small warship, aiming at the mouth of the vats and firing the ship's cannons at them. The giant vats shattered into pieces, and the British laughed loudly and entered Guangzhou."

Even if Lin Zexu did not understand the enemy's situation, he would not have been so absurd. Isn't this just a rustic saying from a village school, or a "chamber pot formation" designed by a pedantic scholar? Liang Yanzhan's "Record of the Yi Threat" records that as soon as Lin arrived in Guangdong, he first investigated the situation at the seacoast, the location of the forts, and presented detailed diagrams. He also bought more than two hundred Western cannons and distributed them to various forts at the ports. How could he have used giant vats to make up the numbers? Later, when the war broke out, Lin also created a method of fire ships. Taking advantage of the dark moon and low tide, they suddenly attacked the enemy ships. They split up and secretly emerged, attacking the head and tail of the enemy ships with the wind behind them. All the fire weapons were thrown from the masts, preventing the enemy ships from escaping. Many British ships suffered setbacks, which is enough to prove that Lin was not a pedantic scholar but an expert in tactics. Moreover, at that time, the British had not yet attacked the provincial capital, so the story of arranging vats is just an embellishment. On the other hand, after Lin was transferred away and replaced by Qishan, the old general Yang Fang from Hunan was sent to Guangzhou to resist the enemy. He really made a big joke with the chamber pot formation. Page 38 of the previous book (published by the Peiping Research Institute, Commercial Press edition) says: "When Fang first arrived, he entered through Foshankou. The people longed for this experienced general, hoping for him like the years. The cheers never stopped wherever he went, and the officials also relied on him as a great wall. After entering the city, he immediately proposed that the Yi cannons always hit us, but we cannot hit the Yi. We are based on solid ground, while the Yi are in the turbulent waves. The host and guest have different forms, how can we be sure of victory? There must be evil cults who are good at spells hidden within them. He ordered the neighborhood chiefs to collect the nearby women's chamber pots as apotropaic objects. He loaded them on wooden rafts and sent them out to defend against Wuyong. He ordered a lieutenant to lead it, with soldiers ambushing on the other side of the river. They agreed that when the cannon fired, they would immediately raise the rafts and line them up on the water's edge with the chamber pot mouths facing the enemy's path, and then they would attack from the raft and sandwich them. When the Yi arrived, they used a telescope to measure the rafts arranged horizontally on the shore. As they approached, the lieutenant had already seen the flags and fled first. There was no one on the rafts, so they drove straight in..."

The two stories are very similar. It is possible that Mr. Xiang heard the rumor and added it to Lin Zexu's story. Originally, there were too many people like Ye Mingchen at that time, so we cannot blame later generations for making presumptuous speculations.

### He Tianjian's Painting Exhibition

Wang Wei's paintings have poetry in the paintings, and Lu You's poems have paintings in the poems. The cultivation that a successful painter should have, in addition to skill in painting, should be reading ten thousand books and travelling ten thousand miles, because art is born from emotion, and the elements of emotion are intertwined with "experience" and "observation." As the "Origin of the Way" in "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" says, "When viewing mountains, emotions fill the mountains; when viewing the sea, emotions fill the sea." Expressing talent and spreading fragrance must rely on rivers and mountains. No wonder Lu You, witnessing the difficulties of the times, had the emotion of "Merit and literature are waning, and it is not enough to just look at the mountains in old age." Poetry expresses intentions, and writing expresses emotions. The highest realm of art is, after all, reaching the same goal by different paths.

Mr. He Tianjian is a painter who possesses the dual conditions of a literati and an artist. He has travelled almost all the famous mountains and rivers in the country. His paintings come from accumulated knowledge and experimentation. Throughout his life, he values integrity and does not take shortcuts. Some people say that he is derived from Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran, but I dare not say that. Let the people who appreciate the paintings go to the Daxin Art Gallery to experience it.

### Lamenting Brother Pan Weizhen

— Zhang Yiqu

The second son of Speaker Pan, brother Weizhen, unfortunately died suddenly of typhoid fever yesterday morning.

Medicine was ineffective, and I am deeply saddened.

Young and promising, he succumbed to illness! The tragic news brings many feelings: The regret of a thousand autumns is beyond medicine, and the heartache of this day is still about war. His future held soaring aspirations, but his passing is unbearable. The elderly parents are heartbroken, speechless as they ask the sky what happened!

Last year, the Zhejiang natives in the old capital customarily held a public sacrifice to the virtuous people of their province at the Guangxian Shrine. Suddenly, one person seized the spirit tablet of a worthy person from the local region, threw it to the ground, and stomped on it. The crowd was not surprised or stopped him, and even regarded it as a matter of course. This spirit tablet belonged to Wang Shitong, also known as Shuheng, who was the father of Wang Yintai. Since the son had been imprisoned for being a traitor, the father could not receive the sound of incense and worship from the people of the region. A joker said that this was certainly in accordance with the old-style opening remark of a case, "The unfilial son's sins are deep and heavy, and he does not perish himself, bringing disaster to his eminent father," truly a tragic comedy. According to reason, the sins of the father and son are not related. Even for the great traitors of previous dynasties, such as the case of Nian Gengyao during the Yongzheng era, the criminal officials initially proposed that his father, Nian Xialing, should be punished quickly, but a certain minister argued that Xialing was not aware of the situation, and the court governed the world with filial piety, how could it punish the father because of the son? Therefore, Xialing was acquitted. Moreover, Wang Shitong had passed away several years before the July 7th Incident, and Yintai's assumption of a false position was even more unrelated. Therefore, whether his spirit tablet should be implicated in the crime of treason and overthrown is a matter for further study. Insiders believe that the question is not whether Yintai is a traitor or not, but the extent of Shitong's "virtue" and his qualification for entry into the shrine.

According to the shrine, it is used to honor virtue and repay merit, and to be a model for future generations to admire and emulate. Therefore, there must be outstanding manifestations that are admired by public opinion, and then there can be a way to secure his position. According to the records of previous dynasties, there are two main types of shrines: (1) those that are granted by the court, such as "accompanying the ancestral temple" and "entering the shrine of virtuous people," which are decided solely by the emperor's edict, and the scholars and people have no way to question them and are indifferent to them. (2) Those that are supported by public opinion, such as "local worthies" and "famous officials," whose qualifications for being enshrined are found in the Complete Book of Academic Administration, namely: "There must be obvious virtue and outstanding behavior, that are consistent with name and reality, and agreed upon by public opinion"; "If the nomination is not true, the local officials and the reporting gentry will be punished." Therefore, in the fifth year of Guangxu, the people of Anhui falsely used Wang Yin's name to jointly request that the former Governor of Sichuan, Wu Tang, be entered into the local worthies shrine. Wang Yin flew from Zhejiang to report to the Governor of Anhui that he was a distant official and was not in the province, and that he had never known about this matter. The Governor of Anhui reported this to the emperor, which became a laughing stock. In addition, after the death of a local official, some local officials and gentry requested that he be recorded as a famous official, but the case was reported by officials and gentry in Beijing and cancelled. There must be morals and scholarship that are examples for the masses for local worthies, and there must be achievements in governing that bring practical benefits to the people for famous officials, and it cannot be forced by power or personal friendship.

Wang Shitong's original name was Yitong (later changed to Shi because of avoiding Puyi's name). He made his mark in Fenyang, Shanxi, originally from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He passed the Guangxu Xinmao examination and the Wuxu Jinshi examination. He rose from the position of secretary in the Ministry of Justice to the position of judge and censor in the Supreme Court. During the Republic of China, he entered Yuan Shikai's presidential palace as a secretary, and later succeeded Zhang Yiying as the director of the secretarial bureau. This person was known to Zhang Baixi in the Qing Dynasty and was responsible for running schools. Zhang and Yuan were in-laws. Yuan's appreciation of Wang was only because his documents were stable and skillful, he was cautious in dealing with matters, and he knew some allusions, which could be used as a tool, which was not the same as Liang Shiyi, the secretary-general who planned the political situation. Later, he also served as the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, a leisurely position. His son, Yintai, studied in Europe and gradually became established. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he was even promoted to Minister of Foreign Affairs by Zhang Zuolin. Wang retired and lived a leisurely life, growing old under the window. In summary, his life was not enough to be a "traitor," and he could not be considered "virtuous." Yintai, relying on his power and position, promoted him to the shrine, which was considered a way of showing filial piety, but in fact it was not only useless, but even if there was no problem of treason, no interesting drama of overthrowing the spirit tablet, he would still inevitably be met with the white eyes of the people of the region. Therefore, it is said that the mistake was in the timing of entering the shrine.
