### U.S. Provides Two Batches of Relief Supplies; All to Arrive in China by Early June; Rumor of Loan to China to Be Executed Through Export of Goods

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] The U.S. State Department announced today that of the $18 million in relief funds for China, approved by Congress last December after the end of UNRRA, $13 million has now been designated for purchasing rice. These two allocations bring the total U.S. relief to China after UNRRA's end to $45.7 million. The first allocation of $27.7 million was approved last July. According to officials at the State Department, the materials under the above two plans are scheduled to arrive in China around June 1st, so that distribution in five major coastal cities of China can be completed before the June 30th expiration date of the plan. The allocation of the $18 million is as follows: $13.087 million to purchase 47,752 tons of rice, representing 84% of the total rice allocated to China by the U.S. in the first six months of this year; $2.282 million to purchase 18,600 tons of American wheat, representing the U.S. wheat allocation to China for February and March; $1 million for medical supplies; $431,000 for coarse grains and corn seeds; and $100,000 for pesticides. Another $1 million is set aside for purchasing petroleum and diesel fuel needed for transporting relief supplies within China. The State Department also disclosed that the 50,000 tons of wheat allocated to China under the first plan has already been shipped in batches, with some already arriving in China. All 43,500 tons of rice are scheduled to be shipped completely by early March, with 9,000 tons already shipped and 20,000 tons scheduled for February. Other materials under the second plan will be shipped immediately. 2,000 tons of mixed grain seeds will be distributed to farmers in drought and flood areas to increase food production. U.S. officials explained that the $1 million for medical supplies is not related to the medical supplies under the tenth plan. This $1 million is to supplement the first plan, and any remaining funds may be used to purchase rice. The above officials, when referring to recent external accusations of the State Department delaying the transportation of the first plan, stated that the transportation plan and its dates were fully agreed upon after consultation between the Chinese government and the U.S. relief goods distribution delegation stationed in Shanghai.

[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] According to American Business Weekly, the $570 million that the U.S. intends to lend to China will follow commercial channels. The method is for private exporters to export goods to the U.S., and then private importers to import goods from the U.S. to China. The list of goods will be handed over to the Chinese government, which will distribute these materials. If this is true, it proves that the pressure exerted by American foreign trade merchants to participate in the implementation of the aid to China plan has yielded results. The newspaper also stated that Japan may supply railway equipment worth $10 million to the Canton-Hankow Railway.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The Washington News discussed the State Department's aid to China plan today, stating that the amount of $570 million does not resemble a long-term plan. Most advocates of aid to China believe that a three-year period is the minimum for any active plan. Regardless of the amount or the duration, China is extremely fragile and requires the greatest skill in allocating and controlling aid in order to be effective. Too much of the U.S. aid that China has received since the victory has been wasted. Chairman Chiang should welcome effective control, but the goal must be to strengthen, not weaken, the Chinese government. The method and amount of aid are equally important. The State Department's plan makes no mention of military aid, which is the most glaring omission. It must be understood that Chairman Chiang's troops need American arms and materials, especially American army and air force instructors.

### This Year's International Trade Plan; Ministry of Economic Affairs Begins Drafting; Types of Goods to Be Exported to Japan Already Approved

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has begun drafting the international trade plan for the 37th year (1948). The content will include four parts: A. Increase exports to compete for foreign markets. B. Improve imports to make full use of foreign exchange for developing China's economy. C. Protect domestic industry. D. Expand the scope of commodity inspection to make our country's goods suitable for foreign market needs.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The list of imports and exports for trade with Japan for the 37th year (1948) was approved at the 12th regular meeting of the Trade with Japan Steering Committee on the afternoon of the 14th. The drafting of this list was in response to a request from the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Japan, and was the responsibility of the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the National Resources Commission, the Export-Import Management Committee, and the China Trust Bureau. After several reviews, a comprehensive review meeting was held on the morning of the 14th to finalize it, and it was submitted to the Trade with Japan Steering Committee for approval in the afternoon. According to the list, the most important goods that our country will propose to export to Japan will be bristles, tung oil, and wool. The goods that Japan is hoped to import will mainly be machinery and industrial raw materials. The list also details the types of imports and exports according to the outline of the trade with Japan plan announced last year. This list will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then submitted to SCAP for General MacArthur's reference.

### Prospects for Private Trade Between China and Japan Appear Bleak; Japan Firmly Demands Exchange of Coal and Iron

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The Japanese government's firm demand to exchange iron ore and coking coal from our country has made it impossible for Chinese businessmen who came to Japan to conclude large trade contracts. Since arriving in Japan three weeks ago, Chinese businessmen have not yet signed any contracts with Japanese commercial firms. Representatives feel that the prospects for private trade between the two countries are bleak. It is reported that although they are currently continuing negotiations with the Japanese Board of Trade and SCAP, even if any contracts are signed, they will not be large-scale. The Japanese government plans to export to China goods that China needs, such as machinery, textiles, and sundries, but does not want to trade with Chinese merchants who cannot supply items necessary for Japanese industry. Iron ore and coking coal are the only items that Japan insists on in exchange for its exports, but these two items are currently strictly controlled by the Chinese government. The items that Chinese merchants can supply, such as ramie and lacquer, are considered non-essential by SCAP and the Japanese Board of Trade. Although the Board of Trade may approve a small number of contracts for these non-essential items, Chinese merchants believe that the total value of transactions this year will be less than one million U.S. dollars. According to confidential documents obtained by reporters from the Japanese government, Japan plans to export machinery and sundries worth 10 million U.S. dollars annually to central and southern China, in addition to chemical products and agricultural products. These include 300 textile machines, 1,000 motors, 19,000 horsepower diesel engines, 3.6 million pounds of rayon, 5,000 tons of newspaper, 3,000 sewing machines, and 5 million blankets.

### U.S. Export License Policy; Relevant Chinese Authorities Intensifying Study

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has been paying close attention to the U.S. announcement of a new export license policy, with an initial list of over 400 types of restricted export items. This list of restricted export items has been sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs by Liu Dajun, the commercial counselor at the Chinese Embassy in the United States. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently studying it. On the morning of the 13th, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Tong Jiling, invited representatives from relevant ministries and commissions to hold the first consultation to discuss the impact of the U.S.'s implementation of the new export license policy on China's international trade and to discuss countermeasures. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Export-Import Management Committee, the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the China Trust Bureau participated. The meeting discussed the limit on the number of the U.S. restriction of export items and the amount of materials that our country needed to import, as well as the amount of foreign exchange that could be used to import materials. However, it was only a preliminary exchange of views, and no conclusions were reached. Another meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss appropriate measures.

### China Reduces Import Quotas; Reaction from U.S. Exporters

[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] The initial reaction of local exporters to China's recent measures to reduce import quotas is that China is clearly trying to preserve its U.S. dollar reserves. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Commerce here said that Nanjing's move to reduce import quotas clearly aims to limit U.S. exports to China. Hunter, the general manager of Williford Company, said that given the burden on China's foreign exchange reserves, the move to reduce import quotas is not surprising, and this move indicates that effective assistance should be given immediately to this war-torn country. The local Chamber of Commerce said that if the reduced import quotas do not include American goods that have not yet been shipped to China, then the impact on exports to China is still small. Some trade figures believe that the Nanjing statement is very timely and may accelerate the passage of the aid to China plan by Congress. At the same time, many exporters are waiting to learn the details of the goods restricted by China's new import rules.

### Macau Gold Imports; This Year's Quota is One Million Ounces

[United Press, Macau, 14th] The Macau government has limited the gold import quota for 1948 to one million ounces, or 250,000 ounces per quarter. The reason for the restriction has not been announced, but recently countries such as the Philippines have announced their compliance with the International Monetary Fund's gold control policy, which may be the reason.

### Lushan Afforestation; Planned Planting of One Million Trees in Three Years

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 14th] Chairman Chiang and his wife were still resting at the Guling official residence on the morning of the 14th. The Chairman also instructed Wu Shih-han, the director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, to expand afforestation in the Olive Mountain area this year and to effectively protect the forests.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] A telegram from Guling recently reported that Chairman Chiang has been in Guling for a week. In addition to touring the scenery in the mountains, he recently instructed Wu Shih-han, the director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, on the direction of afforestation. Wu has drafted a three-year afforestation plan for Lushan, with a target of one million trees: 200,000 trees in the first year, 400,000 trees in the second year, and completion in the third year. Wang Lingji, the chairman of Jiangxi Province, sent a special telegram to Zuo Shunsheng, the Minister of Agriculture, requesting him to send personnel to Guling to assist in realizing this afforestation plan, which is truly one of the Chairman's elegant interests in the mountains.

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 14th] Sun Ke, accompanied by his wife and son Zhiqiang, and Supervisory Committee member Wu Benzhong, arrived in Taipei by plane at 2 p.m. on the 14th. Chairman Wei and his wife, as well as heads of various agencies, went to greet them. After disembarking, Sun and others went to the guesthouse to rest. Sun told reporters that he did not plan to run for Vice President or President. As for the issue of U.S. aid to China, he said that economic difficulties cannot be resolved solely through loans, and there must be more loans to reform the currency system. When talking about Sino-Soviet relations, he said that they were in a "not too close, not too distant" state. After attending the welcome meeting on the 15th, Sun will transfer to the central and southern regions.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 14th] Vice Chairman Sun met with reporters and talked about the mission of his trip to Taiwan, saying: "When I was in Shanghai, I heard many rumors about Taiwan Province. Some foreign reporters, in particular, have distorted the facts in their reports. Therefore, I must come to Taiwan in person to understand the truth. I very much hope that this trip will allow me to accurately understand the wishes of the compatriots in Taiwan Province towards the motherland. At the same time, I will also explore what difficulties the province is facing in promoting government affairs that require assistance from the central government."

### Five-City Grain Rationing Conference; Rescheduled to Begin Tomorrow; 4,000 Tons of U.S. Aid Rice to Arrive in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The grain rationing conference for the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou has been rescheduled to begin on the 16th. The main topics of discussion will be approximately: (A) Discussion of sales prices. It is reported that the Ministry of Food only intends to set prices 5% lower than market prices. (B) Establishment of an agency. It is planned to establish a Grain Allocation Committee in each of the five cities, headed by the mayors of each city. (C) Grain allocation issues for the five cities. (D) Grain needs of each of the five cities.

[Our News] The grain conference for the five major cities will be held in Nanjing starting on the 16th. In addition to the mayors of the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, Jillpatrick, the director of the U.S. Aid to China Relief Agency, and Chen Guangyuan, the director of the Shanghai office of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling U.S. Relief Supplies, also took the overnight train to Nanjing last night to participate in the conference. Director Chen told reporters that the conference will discuss grain rationing issues, and there will be no major changes in principle, only decisions on procedural issues. It is also learned that two rounds of American rice from U.S. aid grain, each carrying 2,000 tons, will arrive in Shanghai within days. This American rice is of excellent quality and will also be used for rationing in the future. As for rationing, whether the rice quality is the same or not, it will be sold at the same price.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 14th] The food rationing in Guangzhou will be implemented next month. Civil servants will be rationed two dou of rice per month. The rationing for citizens has not yet been finalized.

### Special Relief Donation Collection; Decided to Adopt Mandatory Measures; List of Wealthy People Being Carefully Considered

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The discussion on the quotas for the collection of special relief donations in various regions and the list of wealthy people was raised at the design committee of the Special Relief Donation Supervision Committee on the 14th, but no concrete conclusions were reached. A definite decision will be made after the Supervision Committee approves it. Today's meeting was chaired by Wang Fuzhou, the chairman of the committee, and representatives from the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other relevant ministries attended. In terms of quotas, a principle has been roughly decided, that is, the Shanghai area should collect half of the total target of 10 trillion yuan, or 5 trillion yuan. The second largest area is Guangzhou, because Guangzhou includes Hong Kong and Macau, it may reach 1.2 trillion yuan. The Nanjing area is quite difficult to determine, because if Nanjing is only considered from a local perspective, its proportion should not be too large. However, there are quite a few military and political figures who are in office or retired in Nanjing and are among the wealthy. Therefore, some people have suggested that the collection in the Nanjing area should be politically enforced to achieve the collection goal, so the proportion of the Nanjing area should be slightly larger. This discussion did not reach a conclusion at today's meeting. Second, mandatory measures will be adopted to achieve the collection goal. The list is still under careful consideration by the various members, and some members have not yet been selected. However, well-known wealthy people have generally been proposed. As for whether the donations must be paid in cash, it has been decided at the meeting that they can be replaced with in-kind goods, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has been designated to draft specific measures. Second, the meeting also allocated current work, such as the collection work for overseas Chinese, which was assigned to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for research; the Ministry of Interior is responsible for the reward measures for donations; and the Executive Yuan's Information Office is responsible for publicity and promotion. Also approved was the organizational charter and list of members of the committee. This committee is an agency responsible for drafting measures, and it is scheduled to meet once every two weeks, but in the early stages of its establishment, it will be held once a week.

### Air Force Ace Gao Youxin Crushed to Death by Train in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Gao Youxin, an Air Force lieutenant colonel and flying ace who was renowned for his achievements during the War of Resistance, was crushed to death by a train on the railroad tracks east of Wulaoqiao in Nanjing at 3 p.m. on the 13th. Gao suffered from mental disorder, which began in the 35th year (1946). At that time, he flew to the Northeast with Du Yuming to take over the region. One night, while discussing a problem with several colleagues, he became overly excited and unfortunately fell from a high building, sustaining serious injuries. His brain nerves were shaken too much, and he became confused. He was sent to the United States for treatment by the Air Force Headquarters, but after more than half a year, he did not recover completely and returned to the country. After returning to the country, he was treated at the Central Hospital. On the 13th, he was just discharged from the Central Hospital and for some reason, he lay down on the railroad tracks and was crushed to death by a train. Both feet were crushed, and his head was severely injured, and he died on the spot. Gao was the deputy commander of the 14th Squadron of the Air Force, a graduate of the 8th class of the Aviation School, and only 37 years old. During the War of Resistance, he destroyed more than 100 enemy planes and made outstanding achievements 275 times, breaking the highest record in the Air Force's combat achievements. He was awarded as many as 15 medals, including one Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. He was known as the second Gao Zhihang in our country's Air Force and was highly valued by Zhou Zhirou. After Gao was crushed to death, Zhou Zhirou, the commander-in-chief of the Air Force, was deeply saddened when he heard the news. He immediately sent Fan Guanghua, the head of the General Affairs Department, to send his body to the China Funeral Home and notify his family to arrange the funeral. On the morning of the 14th, Gao's body was moved to the China Funeral Home. His wife, Ms. He, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, embraced the body, and cried bitterly, fainting several times. When Gao was in the Central Hospital, his wife, Ms. He, took care of him every day. Ms. He had recently gone to Shanghai for business, and unexpectedly, this unfortunate tragedy occurred just after she returned from Shanghai, so her grief was even greater.

Since Hong Kong goods have been strictly blocked by the government after being smuggled in, smugglers have mostly changed their routes, entering through Shayuchong and Longjiang areas belonging to the Zhuan Yang Bao'an County occupied by the treacherous bandits, then transporting them to the inland through the East River bandit area. The main items are foreign yarn, foreign oil, and cigarettes, exceeding 20,000 dan per day, even more than during the occupied period.

Currently, bandits such as Li Hui and Lin Zhen have led 889 men to surrender. The commander has reorganized them into standing security squadrons and stationed them in the Xinxu area. In addition, sporadic bandits have surrendered in many instances, and they have all been reorganized and resettled one by one.

After the bandits in central Hebei suffered several serious blows from our forces, it is difficult for them to stir up trouble again.

### People from Northeast Living in Beijing Call for Increased Troops

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] As the war in the Northeast is in full swing, people from the Northeast living in Beijing, such as Mo Dehui, Yu Bin, and Wang Depu, have been appealing to relevant parties for increased troops. After visiting President Zhang Qun on the 13th, they continued to visit Chief of Staff Chen Cheng on the 14th to present their opinions. It is learned from relevant parties that they have the following views on the current situation in the Northeast: First, they have confidence in Chen Cheng as the director. In the past, with Chen sitting in town and coordinating the overall situation of military and administration, the people of the Northeast were able to feel psychologically stable. Now that Chen has returned to the capital to recuperate, people in the Northeast cannot help but have national concerns about personnel matters; Second, they are worried about the actions of the National Army, that is, Fan Hanjie's corps tightly guarding Qinhuangdao and Huludao, as if the government is preparing to withdraw from the Northeast, so they have to appeal to the authorities at this juncture to send heavy troops to reinforce the Northeast. However, authoritative sources believe that the central government's policies and determination will definitely not be as the above two points state, and the central government will definitely not abandon the Northeast rashly.

Editorial

### Looking at the Cabinet Tides in Japan

The Katayama Cabinet in Japan, which has been in power for more than eight months, has finally officially announced its collapse. Anyone who pays a little attention to Japanese issues generally believes that the collapse of the Katayama Cabinet was expected. Around February each year is originally Japan's "political season." When Tetsu Katayama, as the leader of the Socialist Party, stepped onto the political stage, he was inherently conservative. Therefore, he could not unify the will of the Socialist Party internally, and it was obvious that he could not survive this political season. Looking at his political achievements over eight months and ten days in office, it can be said that they were extremely mediocre and unproductive. His eventual forced resignation can also be said to have been predetermined.

When we study the reasons for this, the most fundamental reason is that the ruling Socialist Party is not a major party with a majority of seats in the Diet. Although the Socialist Party won the support of voters in the general election last April and nominally became the largest party in Japan, the number of seats it won did not exceed half. Until the day the Katayama Cabinet resigned, the distribution of power among the parties in the Japanese House of Representatives was still as follows: Socialist Party 123 seats, Liberal Party 119 seats, Democratic Party 102 seats, National Cooperative Party 32 seats, Comrades Association 22 seats, All Farmers Group 16 seats, First Member Club 15 seats, Farmers Party 7 seats, Communist Party 4 seats, Independents 2 seats, Vacancies 20 seats. Since Katayama could not organize a pure Socialist Party cabinet, he had to win over the other three major parties to form a four-party coalition cabinet, and therefore had to make considerable concessions in policy. At the same time, the formation of the coalition cabinet was not thorough enough. On the one hand, Tetsu Katayama refused to allow the left wing of the Socialist Party to join the cabinet, and on the other hand, the leader of the Liberal Party, Kotada, refused to join the cabinet, preferring to be the largest party in opposition. Therefore, the Katayama Cabinet was inherently mediocre and incompetent, and the crisis of internal division had long been lurking. In the past eight months, it has not only been frequently attacked by the opposition Liberal Party, but also the parties in power have been nominally united and often disagreed, so its political foundation has been shaky every day. When the second session of the Diet reconvened on the 10th of this month and the "political season" began, the Katayama Cabinet tried its best to struggle, but Jun Ashida, the leader of the Democratic Party, finally disagreed with Katayama and agreed to the resignation of the cabinet, so the Katayama Cabinet had to resort to a general resignation. As Katayama stated in his statement: "The general resignation of the cabinet today is the inevitable result of the coalition cabinet. I can be proud that I have never made a single mistake in the development of democratic politics in Japan; especially by trying to avoid dissolving the House of Representatives and causing the cabinet to resign en masse, it is the result of a fair judgment of the domestic and foreign political situation. As for the future cabinet, in the current situation without a majority party, I think it is more appropriate to organize a coalition cabinet."

But after the Katayama Cabinet resigned en masse, who will succeed in forming the cabinet? This question should be noted by people from all countries. As of this writing, we dare not make a hasty judgment. After learning of the cabinet's en masse resignation, Speaker of the House of Representatives Matsuoka visited Jun Ashida of the Democratic Party, Katayama of the Socialist Party, and Miki of the Cooperative Party respectively to exchange views on forming a cabinet. The three party leaders unanimously agreed to convene a four-party leaders meeting. When Matsutou visited Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party, Yoshida believed that since the Liberal Party is the largest party in opposition, it should naturally succeed in forming a cabinet and governing; even if a four-party coalition cabinet is formed, the Liberal Party should obtain the position of prime minister. According to "constitutional rules," Yoshida should be nominated as the next prime minister; there are also expressions of support in the House of Councillors. However, looking around at the situation, it does not seem to be the time for Yoshida's comeback. First, the conservative new party movement led by Yoshida has not yet matured, and it is too early to come out to form a cabinet at this time. Second, MacArthur has not only expressed opposition to the new party movement, but has also sometimes taken repressive measures. The representative of the Allied Headquarters will make a statement on the successor candidate: "If the Katayama Cabinet resigns, when there is no majority party in Japan that can succeed in forming a cabinet, the only way is for the parties to negotiate a coalition cabinet in the Diet; if the agreement fails, then the only way is to dissolve the Diet to decide which majority party in the next Diet will organize a new cabinet. In my personal opinion, I do not quite agree with the new party movement that is currently being proposed." In today's Japan, the Allied Headquarters' implication is nothing less than a powerful instruction. No matter how good Yoshida is at dealing with it, he will not be able to overcome this major obstacle. Therefore, based on the current situation, everyone believes that the possibility of Jun Ashida of the Democratic Party becoming the prime minister is the greatest.

Dong Tian also advocates that the Socialist Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Party, and Cooperative Party should jointly organize a four-party coalition cabinet. The Democratic Party's executive committee decided on the 12th to reject the tolerance policy towards the left wing of the Socialist Party and strive to seek a compromise with the Liberal Party; moreover, the current political situation is also conducive to Ashida. MacArthur has already stated: "The solution to Japan's political problems will be decided by the Japanese people." Inadvertently, he has expressed his intention to support Ashida's cabinet formation. But we know that the Democratic Party's position in the House of Representatives is not only inferior to the Socialist Party, but also not as good as the Liberal Party. If Ashida attempts to form a four-party coalition cabinet but cannot obtain the cooperation and support of the Liberal Party, then the political foundation for his cabinet formation will be even weaker and more unstable than the Katayama Cabinet. Even if a cabinet is reluctantly formed, it will have no future. The current political situation in Japan is extremely chaotic, not only creating a situation of many small parties, but also the ideological differences between the parties are extremely chaotic.

The difficult birth of the Japanese cabinet has not only caused the Allied Headquarters to feel deeply anxious, but has also warned Japanese political parties not to use large parties to oppress small parties. Moreover, Katayama himself said that the candidate for the next prime minister is "unknown." Therefore, looking forward to the cabinet tides in Japan, it is just beginning. Yoshida and Ashida are competing, and their strengths are evenly matched, so there is a possibility of both sides being injured. In the end, Katayama may reorganize the coalition cabinet again. This can be seen from the Socialist Party's efforts to unify the left and right wings in recent days. Because the fundamental reason for the Katayama Cabinet's general resignation lies in the internal split of the Socialist Party. Therefore, if the split phenomenon can be eliminated, the three-party coalition cabinet centered on the Socialist Party will naturally still have the possibility of a resurgence.

### CCP Radio Broadcast Demands US Troops Withdraw, Otherwise No Preferential Treatment for Captured US Soldiers

[Associated Press San Francisco Thirteenth Dispatch] The CCP radio broadcast on the thirteenth is generally regarded as nothing more than a final notice demanding the US Navy and Marine Corps to leave China. The CCP broadcast also demanded that the United States guarantee that it would no longer provide assistance to the National Government as an exchange condition for lenient treatment of the four US Marines captured by the Communist Party since Christmas last year. They disappeared on Christmas Day while hunting outside Qingdao, the headquarters of the US Navy in the Western Pacific. The burned-out jeep was found 33 miles north of Qingdao near Laiyang City. According to the broadcast received by the Associated Press, the capture of the four US Marines was due to their assistance to the National Army in combat. It continued that the headquarters of the "Jiaodong People's Liberation Army" had lodged a strong protest with the US Navy in China, demanding an apology and a guarantee that there would be no such actions in the future. Otherwise, the US Navy and the US government should bear full responsibility for the consequences of these actions. If the US Navy authorities accept this legitimate request, the "Liberation Army" will treat the captured US Marines leniently in the spirit of friendship between the Chinese and American people. The broadcast listed numerous accidents caused by the US actively providing military assistance to the Chinese government and then said: "To avoid the recurrence of such accidents, the US armed forces and military personnel should immediately withdraw from China."

The CCP radio said that the five Marines were captured near Laiyang while assisting the National Army in combat. One of them, named Blaydon, was wounded in combat and died in a field hospital.

However, when they disappeared, the US Navy Headquarters in China claimed that the four Marines were actually out hunting. They were carrying hunting rifles, not rifles as claimed by the Communist Party, and the fifth person participated privately without permission.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] According to a broadcast received here this morning from the Communist bandits, five US soldiers of the US Marine Corps in Qingdao who disappeared on November 2 last year, one of them has been killed, and the other four are still prisoners of the Communist bandits in Shandong. The killed person was Private Blaydon, and the other four were Corporal Taulard, Private First Class Dixon, Private Hart, and Private First Class Jabody Stelia. Mailby, the head of the US Embassy's press office, told reporters this morning: The claim in the broadcast that the five people were captured last year 100 li [Chinese mile] from their headquarters because they actively helped the National Army in combat is absolutely not true. The five people were arrested while hunting. The broadcast continued that the CCP had lodged a very strong protest with the US Navy authorities in China, demanding that the latter apologize and guarantee that there would be no similar situations in the future. The protest also stated that if the US Navy authorities accept this request, the CCP will give the captured four US soldiers lenient treatment. During his meeting with reporters, Mr. Mai also said that he had not heard of any protests to the US Navy authorities in China. What he heard this time was the first new information about them since the five people disappeared.

### Cardinal Tian Gengxin Speaks

Communist Bandits Wantonly Destroy Religion, Belief in Church Struggle Strengthens

[Our City News] The Communist bandits wantonly destroy religion in their occupied areas, which has been confirmed by Cardinal Tian Gengxin, who has just arrived in Shanghai from Beiping. Tian told reporters: There are now more than 2,000 Catholics in Beiping who have escaped from various Communist bandit-occupied areas. Many of them have been arrested and detained by the Communist bandits. Although missionary work in the Communist area of North China is extremely difficult, the Church has never considered a plan to withdraw. Because the Catholic Church has undergone full or partial suffering and tempering in various countries around the world for more than 1,000 years, the difficult history has strengthened our belief in struggling against evil forces. Tian came to Shanghai to participate in the National Catholic Education Conference. He said: He plans to propose to the conference that each of the 130 dioceses in the country should subsidize two poor college students to study abroad, and to establish a general organization to promote educational work. The dioceses should fully cooperate to achieve results more easily.

### British Overseas Chinese in Burma Face Identity Issues

### County Magistrates Who Pass the Examination to be Given Priority for Appointment According to Law

Executive Yuan and Examination Yuan Reiterate Previous Order

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan have jointly issued an order to the provincial governments, reiterating that county magistrates who have passed the examination and those selected by the Central Government should be given priority for appointment according to the law. The order reads as follows: "It has been previously ordered on December 5, 1945, that personnel who have passed the county magistrate examination according to law in various provinces, as well as county magistrates selected by the Central Government, should be given priority for appointment according to law. However, it has been reported that many provincial governments are still delaying the appointment of the aforementioned personnel, or even if they have been appointed, they are arbitrarily transferred or dismissed without any fault on their part, which is a great loss to the intention of careful selection and recruitment. This order is now reiterated. Hereafter, when provincial governments fill county magistrate positions - except for the county magistrate positions in pacification areas, which may be temporarily filled by personnel selected by the provincial government based on the actual situation of each county to meet practical needs; the remaining county magistrate positions in non-pacification areas (this section applies to the provinces of Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Rehe) - must strictly adhere to Article 10 of the Civil Service Appointment Law, Article 1 of the County Magistrate Appointment Law, and Article 12 of the Regulations for the Selection of County Magistrates from Qualified Candidates in Higher Examinations, and give priority to appointing county magistrates who have passed the examination and those who have been selected in turn. Only when the aforementioned two categories of personnel and the qualified county magistrates selected by the Central Government and distributed by the Ministry of Interior are insufficient for appointment may other qualified personnel be appointed. Those who have already been appointed and are currently in office should be legally protected. If other personnel are arbitrarily appointed, the Ministry of Personnel will be held responsible for not reviewing the appointment, and will jointly order the replacement of those personnel with the Ministry of Interior, and will also be held accountable based on the severity of the situation."

### Suzhou Market Opens, Prices Generally Stable

Few Businesses Open in Wuxi Yesterday

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 14th] All markets here opened for trading this morning. Fortunately, there were no major disturbances. White rice was priced at 1,605,000 per zu (unit), and flour at 745,000 per bag. However, due to public observation, there were not many transactions.

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 14th] Today is the day to send off the God of Wealth in the lunar calendar, and the almanac indicates it is an ordinary day, which merchants consider inauspicious. Furthermore, as all goods are expected to rise in price, few businesses officially opened. Most are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The markets for grains, flour, and cotton yarn were not open. Only soybean oil had a market price, reaching 4,100,000 per dan (unit), with a bullish trend expected to rise without falling.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] Due to grain price fluctuations, the Chongqing City has established a Grain Regulation Committee, deciding that unpolished rice should not exceed 700,000 per shi (unit), and top-grade rice should be 910,000.

Furthermore, in order to prevent spring famine and replenish food reserves, the Provincial Government has decided to request the Central Government to open ordinary food loans, suggesting that the Central Government purchase and store 20,000 shi (unit) of rice in each of the four counties of Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, requiring approximately 120 billion, to be approved and loaned by the Central Government and handled by the county governments for storage and purchase.

### Jinan Flour Prices Rise Sharply; Food Prospects Cause Concern

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 14th] The price of top-grade flour here has broken the million mark per bag. The reporter specifically interviewed Director Li Disheng of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, who stated that based on the current grain sources and prices in various places, the spring famine in the city is expected to be severe. The source of grain is currently limited to Zhangdian and Tai'an. The areas of Kezhou and Jining have not yet opened for free trading. It is expected that flour prices will continue to rise. The municipal government is currently unable to open up grain sources. The only effective way to control grain prices is to forward a request to the Central Government for the transportation of southern grain to the north, emulating the request of Tianjin and Beijing for subsidies on flour. The banditry in Shandong has not yet been suppressed, and Jinan is crowded with refugees. If effective countermeasures are not taken quickly, the future is a cause for concern.

### U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves in Principle the Four-Year Aid to Europe Recovery Plan; Stipulates Initial 12-Month Expenditure of $5.3 Billion; Submission to Senate Next Month Will Spark Heated Debate

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed the Four-Year Aid to Europe Act by a vote of 13 to 0, stipulating an initial 12-month expenditure of $5.3 billion. President Truman had requested an initial 15-month expenditure of $6.8 billion. Committee Chairman Vandenberg said that the reduction was due to a "change in schedule" rather than a decrease in the net amount. Shortening the term to 15 months allows the new Congress (meaning the new Congress after the November elections) to have the opportunity to conduct a realistic review of the implementation of the aid to Europe plan and then vote on the necessary additional funding. The original text of the bill still has a few minor details that need to be sorted out before it can be finalized. However, today's decision has resolved the last major issue, and it is expected to be submitted to the Senate for discussion within the next week. Republican Senator Taft and other members of the party have called for drastic cuts, with Taft advocating a $2 billion reduction. Vandenberg also said that the bill stipulates that a construction syndicate will advance $1 billion as start-up capital, so that funds will not be lacking while Congress discusses individual appropriation bills. The effective period is until the end of June 1952, which is what the government requested. As for transportation, the bill stipulates a compromise, allowing countries participating in the aid to Europe plan to lease 300 U.S. ships. The government had requested the sale of 200 ships and the lease of 300 ships, which was opposed by shipping associations and other groups.

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] Judging from various signs, a "knockdown, drag-out" fight will occur when the bill is submitted to the Senate on March 1. Taft admitted that the Senate had made greater progress than the original proposal of the State Department, but still believes that the amount is too high. The group of amendments has threatened to devise a battlefield strategy. Other obstacles to the aid to Europe plan include the appropriation committees of both houses, which hold the life and death power over the total amount of funds.

### Secretary of State Marshall Delivers Speech, Endorses Western European Alliance; U.S. Aid to Europe Aims to Establish Peace

[Associated Press, Des Moines, Iowa, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall praised the proposed political alliance of Western Europe on the evening of the 13th, saying that it is our greatest hope. Marshall also warned that the success of the Marshall Plan is the last chance for the world to avoid Communist domination. After Marshall's special plane stopped in Knoxville, Tennessee, he addressed a crowd of national rural studies gathered here via radio. In his speech, Marshall made the first direct comment on British Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent proposal for a "Western European Alliance" of Britain, France, and other countries.

[Reuters] Marshall said, "We, the American people, are now facing the most important decision in history, which will have a far-reaching impact on the entire world. Like all other major decisions, once decided, it cannot be changed, and there is no chance for a second guess. The major decision we are about to take on our foreign policy today is made in the American way, but there is a danger here, that we may pay too much attention to the details, thus neglecting the most important goal of the European recovery plan. We should make the goal of this plan and its relationship with the future of the world clear. This is a great effort representing concrete leadership. Once adopted, it will be our greatest historical masterpiece on the world civilization table. If there is no mistake, the result of its success or failure will determine the survival of the world, so that democratic free economic stability and peace can be maintained.

The Soviet Union and its Communist comrades used the post-war crisis to gain control of all of Europe. If Western Europe has a stable and sound situation, the Soviet leaders will be able to reach an agreement on peace terms more clearly. Congress will soon take a decision that will determine the long-term history and the future destiny of our country. In my personal opinion, I think we are at a crossroads? There are two paths for our future: we can decide that the difficulties and dangers of the European recovery plan are too great, so there is no need to do anything; we can also deal with the current situation with half a heart and inappropriate situation. As far as the latter is concerned, its effect is equal to doing nothing, but at the same time we still have to pay a huge price. More serious than the material effect is the psychological distrust of American leadership. If we take this decision, Western Europe will inevitably be under the same control as Eastern Europe. The methods adopted in each country may be different, but the result will be the same. Under these conditions, free institutions will not exist on the European continent for a long time. I stated after the failure of the Moscow Conference last year that the U.S. government holds a world-recognized leadership position and can take several active actions to save the situation. The passive attitude we have adopted in the past can no longer be tolerated. The decision at that time was to convene the Paris Sixteen Nations Conference, which became the most important step in building a peaceful world. British Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent proposal indicates that European countries have taken another step beyond the agreement on economic cooperation to consider a Western European alliance. This development is truly our great hope. I hope that the American people will weigh the gains and losses at home and the importance of the goals of the European recovery plan. I think all Americans believe that America is the most powerful country in the world. We must seek a better life for people all over the world. We have a great responsibility. Leaders have the responsibility to lead. The more critical the situation is, the greater the need for leaders to take action. This is what I ask of the people across the country today."

### Western European Sixteen Nations Conference May Be Held at the End of Next Month

[Associated Press, Paris, 14th] A spokesman for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the proposal to convene the Sixteen Nations Conference under the Marshall Plan is under discussion. All parties seem to agree. He said that the motive for convening a new conference was the result of discussions by the inspection committee organized by representatives of Britain, the United States, and France. He said that the Sixteen Nations Conference is expected to begin before March 28.

### Soviet Union and Hungary Conclude Mutual Assistance Treaty; Delegation Heads to Moscow

[Reuters, Budapest, 13th] Hungarian President Tildy and Prime Minister Dinnyés led a government delegation to Moscow today.

Other members of the delegation include Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi, Foreign Minister Molnár, Defense Minister Faragho, and several experts.

### Soviet Union Purchases Large Amount of Industrial Equipment from Britain

[Central News Agency, London, 13th Associated Press] Amidst the incessant clamor of the diplomatic war between the East and West blocs, the Soviet Union is quietly negotiating with the British in London to purchase British industrial and scientific equipment worth millions of U.S. dollars, in accordance with the recently concluded British-Soviet commercial agreement.

### Pidoux Elucidates France's Position: The European Continent Cannot Tolerate Division; Solving the German Problem Requires Ensuring It Cannot Re-Aggress

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] French Foreign Minister Pidoux, in his address during the foreign policy debate in the National Assembly, announced that representatives from Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will soon convene in Rome to study the conditions for establishing a customs union. Pidoux reaffirmed that aid under the Marshall Plan is indispensable for European welfare and world peace. Pidoux also emphasized that France believes Europe is an integral whole, and the current state of division is intolerable.

France believes that the scope of Europe extends from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea to the Ural Mountains, encompassed by the spirit of Christian humanism. However, today, the traditional civilization of Europe is represented only by the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan. The division of Europe is the responsibility of the Soviet Union, and the result of this division is a great misfortune, but France does not accept the current division as the final state. When referring to the relationship between Britain and France, Pidoux expressed that the French government greatly welcomes Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent proposal. France is willing to hold discussions with any European country that shares the same views. Regarding the German problem, Pidoux believes that Germany's potential for aggression should be eliminated forever. The only solution for Germany's eastern border issue is to integrate Germany into the European community, establishing a peaceful Germany without aggressive intent. Pidoux also emphasized that France has no preconditions for economic aid, pointing out that if other countries can propose aid to France under the same independent conditions, France would be happy to accept it. Pidoux also warned that the victors of the last world war, wanting to split Germany into two, would be a dangerous undertaking. France firmly opposes the re-establishment of the Germany of the past, and France will never allow a Bismarckian Germany to reappear. France advocates effective control, but has never opposed Germany's economic recovery, only feeling that Germany's economic recovery should not take precedence over that of the allied nations.

### Fraser Succeeds Cunningham as Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy

Policy Underwent a Transformation in a Panic

During 1940, our relationship with the Soviet Union was governed by a desire not to do anything that would push it further into Germany's embrace, while also trying to limit our exports to the Soviet Union to a certain extent so that it would not have surplus military materials that could be transferred to Germany.

Due to the war, the Soviet Union was unable to obtain many types of military materials and wanted to maintain trade relations with the United States. However, it did not understand why we did not simply open our arms to accept it.

Sometimes, it demanded the impossible. It tried for months to buy a battleship from an American shipbuilder. The President and I were willing to build one for it, but the Soviet Union insisted that the latest American equipment and inventions must be included. The Navy could agree to build a battleship that was at least as new as the ones we currently had, but of course, it was unwilling to give the Soviet Union all the latest secrets that the United States had painstakingly researched over the years, some of which were being installed on the new battleships we were building at the time.

On April 2, 1940, I and Oumansky had a frank discussion on US-Soviet relations. Oumansky was one of the most difficult foreign diplomats we had ever encountered. His attitude and words were often insulting, and he was hostile to anyone among us, as if he was inherently capable of it. He was rude, demanding concessions as if they were a matter of course, and protesting our actions as if they were extremely bad mistakes. In my opinion, he had caused considerable damage to US-Soviet relations.

When Oumansky came to see me this time, he had many things to complain about. He began by listing many so-called grievances. He pointed out that some American companies refused to allow Soviet engineers or those preparing to purchase goods to inspect their factories; that some Soviet men and women of some standing who had obtained temporary passports to come to the United States were detained on Ellis Island for a long time; and our moral embargo (related to the Soviet-Finnish War). Then he bluntly asked whether our government wanted to continue or abandon commercial relations with the Soviet Union.

I was determined not to express any opinion.

Then, he pointed out that the moral embargo was only applicable to the Soviet Union.

I pointed out to him that this applied to all countries engaged in the bombing of civilians.

Oumansky denied that his country was engaged in the bombing of civilians.

I replied, "We have very satisfactory evidence that the Soviet Union is indeed bombing civilians. Given the language you use when discussing this matter, I know that I cannot convince you of my view, just as you cannot convince me of the opposite."

Every time the ambassador tried to explain his government's peaceful intentions, I always tried to give him the impression that I expressed doubt.

The conversation continued for nearly an hour. Oumansky concluded by saying that his government had no intention of interfering in the province of Bessarabia in eastern Romania, which belonged to Russia before the 1914-1918 war; the Soviet Union did not believe that Turkey would participate in the Allied intervention in the Baku oil region; the Soviet Union had no intentions in any part of the Near East; but he avoided topics related to Finland and Germany.

On May 29, I sent a telegram to our embassy in the Soviet Union, requesting information on the movement of Soviet troops towards the Romanian border. American Minister to Romania Gunther had telegraphed me, saying that a large number of Soviet troops were concentrated along the Romanian border. The Romanian side believed that Stalin was shocked by the German victory in the West and was trying to obtain Romanian territory so that he could have better bargaining chips when negotiating with Hitler. They mentioned the province of Bessarabia in eastern Romania.

After our chargé d'affaires in Moscow, Thurston, met with Foreign Minister Molotov, he telegraphed me on May 31, saying that Molotov was extremely dissatisfied with the United States. He was particularly angry about the cancellation of Soviet orders by American companies, saying it was unfriendly and intolerable. When Thurston explained that we were also requisitioning orders from other governments for reasons of national defense, so there was no discrimination against the Soviet Union, Molotov became even more angry. He said that we had no right to change the normal methods of interaction between governments, and our actions were illegal and intolerable; we must bear full responsibility for this, and it would not be good for us.

But in early June, Thurston began to tell us that the Soviet government's attitude towards the Allies had changed. Moscow was shocked by the rapid advance of the German army and now hoped that France would continue to fight. Previously, Moscow had supported the French Communist Party in obstructing the activities of the Reynaud government.

Ambassador Oumansky, who was the embodiment of insult at his worst, came to see me on June 12. I knew that he was going to protest about one thing, and that was that our own government was taking over the machine tools that his government had previously ordered for reasons of national defense. I was quite familiar with the many meetings he and other officials of the State Department had held on this issue, and the rude tone he had adopted at the time, so this time I started the discussion myself.

After mentioning the many efforts we had made to cooperate with every other country that was inclined to peace—especially hoping to obtain the cooperation of the Soviet Union—I went on to say: "When we see all these efforts are completely in vain, we feel unspeakable disappointment and regret. In this situation, my government has begun a new policy of arming, arming, and continuously arming, in order to defend itself against any possible enemy. With this as the goal, my government does not hesitate to collect the necessary materials, or to preserve all the goods necessary for our day-and-night arms program."

I finally said that we were extremely disappointed that we had not obtained fuller and more extensive cooperation from the Soviet Union than in the past seven years.

Oumansky began to talk about what he said was trade discrimination being practiced by our government. I interrupted him immediately:

"In view of the current emergency situation, I am amazed that your government is paying attention to such small disputes. Your government is giving preferential treatment to other countries in its trade methods, discriminating against us, and we have nothing to say. This includes transporting large quantities of military supplies to Germany."

Oumansky pointed out that this was normal trade.

I replied, "No matter what it includes, a large number of supplies urgently needed for war, this makes it very different from normal trade. Of course, as far as my government is concerned, the Soviet Union has the full right to conduct this kind of trade. But during the Italo-Ethiopian War, we adopted a very different policy towards Italy, and at that time we used a moral embargo to reduce our trade to pre-war levels. But my main point is to explain our current policy of preserving raw materials to increase armament."

Then I said that because we sincerely hoped that the Soviet Union could play a major role in peace, the President was very willing to step in and mediate before the Soviet Union invaded Finland.

Oumansky said in a rather sarcastic tone—sarcasm that would come out of the ambassador's mouth as easily as chaff from a threshing machine—yes, but his government's reaction to a certain speech by the President at the time was not very good. He was referring to the President's condemnation of the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland.

I replied, "When a huge country is holding a small, helpless country by the throat to suffocate it to death, I must admit that the government of this large country will not have a good reaction or take action towards our mediation. In this situation, the only way is to remain silent as much as possible."

The ambassador seemed a little uneasy, but did not answer.

Remembering the fierce and arrogant talk that Molotov had given to Chargé d'Affaires Thurston in Moscow a few days earlier, and the loud insults that the ambassador had offered in Washington whenever he had the chance, I expressed my opinion:

"Mr. Molotov seems very "arrogant". I also hear from time to time in Washington that Mr. Molotov's representative is making rude remarks. For seven years, I have been subjected to sharp criticism for trying to maintain and improve somewhat decent relations with the Soviet Union, and it seems that this is the reward I have received."

When Oumansky continued to express his dissatisfaction, I said that I could list a long list of things that I felt sincerely dissatisfied with about the Soviet Union, but I was unwilling to say more than I had already said. He asked me—or rather, forced me—to say some of the things I could think of. Coincidentally, Ambassador Steinhardt had already returned to Washington from Moscow and had written me several pages of things that I was dissatisfied with about the Soviet Union, and these pages were in my hand. So I read the first page of the points that Steinhardt criticized, and said that I could read several more pages, but I did not want to.

Finally, I mentioned my lengthy and sincere efforts to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and said: "Whenever the Soviet Union deems it appropriate, my government will be happy to resume a policy that seeks to more fully develop peaceful relations and mutually beneficial cooperation in every practical way. Our trade with the Soviet Union is relatively small. It would be a mistake to exaggerate our special emphasis on it, but we are willing to maintain this trade and develop it, as long as this development takes place under conditions that are mutually acceptable to both of our countries."

Almost at the time of this conversation, I began to receive telegrams from our representatives in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, reporting that the Soviet Union was demanding the complete occupation of these countries by Soviet troops and that the governments of these countries should be reorganized to be more friendly to the Soviet Union. The Baltic countries had to agree. The Soviet occupation began on June 15.

One reason for this action was very clear; Stalin hoped to obtain a better defensive position to deal with Germany. Our Minister to Latvia, Felts, telegraphed me on June 19, saying that, according to reliable sources, the Kremlin was extremely worried about recent developments, and was almost at a loss. Stalin's policy was based on the assumption of a long-term war of attrition in the West. After the collapse of France, this policy also collapsed. Hitler recently stated that he did not want to destroy the British Empire, with the aim of inducing Britain to propose peace, but the Soviet Union was panicked, fearing that the problem in Western Europe would be resolved at the expense of the Soviet Union.

Two weeks after the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic countries, it took another defensive measure in Europe, occupying the province of Bessarabia in Romania and part of Bukovina. The fears that our Minister to Bucharest, Gunther, had expressed to me in May had now become a reality. Now, the defensive position of the Soviet Union's southwestern border had been strengthened. The occupation of the Baltic countries and Romanian territory had straightened the arc of its western border.

Telegrams from our representatives in various places pointed to one conclusion, that the Soviet Union had not notified the Hitler government of these actions beforehand. German-Soviet relations were now beginning to show tension.

### US and USSR Held Secret Talks in Berlin to Discuss Various Important Issues

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Authoritative sources say that spokespersons from the United States and the Soviet Union, one each, recently held secret meetings in Berlin to discuss outstanding issues between the two countries. Detailed records of the discussions have been submitted to the State Department. The US spokesperson who participated in the talks was Clay, political advisor to the US military commander in Germany; the Soviet spokesperson was an advisor to Soviet military commander Sokolovsky, whose name is unknown. This meeting was initiated by the Soviet Union, and all issues related to the Marshall Plan, the German-Austrian peace treaty, trade between Eastern and Western Europe, and various other related matters were discussed. Authoritative sources here have refused to make any speculation about the outcome of this meeting, nor are they willing to express any hope for it.

### Japanese House of Representatives Will Decide on the New Prime Minister Within the Next Week; The Soviet Union Asks the Allied Council to Discuss Japanese Politics

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] According to signs on the 14th, Japan's new prime minister will be produced in the Lower House within the next week by a name-by-name vote. Lower House Speaker Matsuoka had attempted to avoid breaking the deadlock by suggesting a joint meeting of party representatives to resolve the issue. However, due to the incompatibility of the two major conservative parties, his efforts were unsuccessful.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The third meeting of the four-party secretaries-general was held on the afternoon of the 14th, with a small delegation in attendance. At the outset, Secretary-General Tsugeno of the Liberal Party proposed "that the next prime minister be nominated by voting in the Diet," but this was opposed by the Social Democratic parties. As a result, it was decided to convene a Diet Steering Committee on the 16th to nominate the next prime minister, thus deciding Japan's next prime minister.

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Kislenko, suggested that the current political crisis in Japan should be discussed in the Allied Council. He requested a "discussion of the reasons for the resignation of the Katayama cabinet and the nature and appearance of the new cabinet." This issue has been added to the agenda of the Allied Council meeting next Wednesday. Observers believe that this is the clearest indication of the Soviet Union's attempt to introduce the policies of Japanese political parties into discussions in the four-power conference.

### US Establishes Atomic Bomb Experiment Stations in Hiroshima and Kure to Study the Effects of Atomic Bombs Long-Term

Commander Qauqji will take office next week. According to talks, "We are ready, and Arab soldiers are more than capable of extinguishing Jewish aggression." According to sources in Cairo, Hussein, vice-chairman of the Arab Higher Executive Committee, said that a new "democratic congress" governing the Palestinian military and political affairs will be established next month. The congress symbolizes the expansion of the Executive Committee and will not be elected. We do not have time for elections; now is only the time for battle.

### Indonesia Decides to Participate in the Federal Provisional Government; Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta Announces

[This newspaper's dispatch] New York, 14th Broadcast: Batavia news, Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Hatta said today, Indonesian Republic will join the Indonesian Federal Provisional Government, even if it give up some of its current powers, it will not care. It is reported that Hatta has notified the Netherlands East Indies government of this idea, and will soon receive a reply.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] American representative on the UN Security Council Indonesia Mediation Group, Graham, resigned today, and return to the position of president of the University of North Carolina. President Truman has ordered former Consul General to Batavia, DuBois, to succeed him.

[Reuters, Batavia, 13th] After the Lake Success released a UN speech of the spokesman of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute mediation committee today, it caused a bad reaction from the Dutch side. Therefore, the Dutch representatives have requested a postponement of the Dutch-Indonesian delegation comprehensive committee scheduled to be held today, so the next stage of Dutch-Indonesian relations has been delayed to start. The purpose of the comprehensive committee is to negotiate the steps for the two delegations to start political negotiations. However, well-informed Dutch sources still deny that the Dutch side is unwilling to continue negotiations. The UN mediation committee spokesman's speech released yesterday at Lake Success stated that the Security Council needs the mediation committee to continue its activities until the establishment of the United States of Indonesia. During the existence of the mediation committee, a solution can be established within two or three months. At the same time, plebiscites in the disputed areas can also be held under the supervision of the mediation committee. The Dutch-Indonesian government's communique stated today that the task of the mediation committee is only to mediate. Exceeding this will inevitably damage the trust between the two sides. The mediation committee spokesman also said that if fair votes are held in Java, Sumatra, and Madura, 90 percent of the people will support the Republic government. The spokesman also said: Autonomous regions outside Java, Sumatra, and Madura can decide whether these regions are under the puppet government by holding plebiscites. The Dutch communique pointed out that the spokesman's suggestion to hold this plebiscite is improper, and the aforementioned autonomous regions are completely outside the scope of the mediation committee's authority.

### Seven Organizations Confer and Decide to Calculate Rent Based on Index; To Be Submitted to the Municipal Council for Discussion Before Being Sent to the City Council for Approval

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, representatives from seven organizations, including the City Council, the Land Administration Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, the General Reserve Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Real Estate Industry Association, and the Local Court, met at the Land Administration Bureau to discuss the issue of housing rent standards in this city. Based on collected data from the Municipal Government Statistics Office's cost of living index for workers, clerks, and teachers, including the rent index, they exchanged opinions and concluded that the previous method of calculating rent by multiples was not suitable for actual conditions. They decided in principle not to set a fixed multiple but to calculate rent based on a discounted rate of the cost of living index. It has not been decided which of the three categories—workers, clerks, or teachers—will be used as the basis for the index, but in any case, a significant discount must be applied. The representatives unanimously agreed that teachers have low incomes, and the rent for their housing should be subject to a particularly large discount when calculated using the index. It is estimated that city rents can be divided into three categories: (1) Commercial properties, with a smaller discount applied to the index; (2) Residential properties, with a larger discount applied; and (3) Housing for teachers, with an even larger discount applied to the index. According to Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping in an interview with reporters, the fundamental reason for discussing rent standards is the housing shortage. Therefore, the meeting decided that to encourage construction, rents for newly built houses should not be restricted, in order to promote housing construction. The principles agreed upon by the representatives of the seven organizations, as well as the question of which cost of living index to use and the size of the discount, still need to be submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion and then to the City Council for approval. It is hoped that the public and citizens will provide more opinions on this issue, so that the city's rent standards are not only reasonable but also adapted to actual conditions.

According to the December 1947 cost of living index for clerks in this city, the housing index was 15,600 times. The housing category in the worker index was 46,400 times (including water, electricity, coal, and firewood). The housing index in the teacher index was 9,140 times.

### Countless Poor Students Eagerly Awaiting Relief; Hoping that Wealthy People Will Help More

Since the Spring Festival, the solicitation work for the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" has been relatively smooth.

With your help, countless poor students are waiting for relief.

Regarding applications, more than half of the schools have already completed and sent them in. In order to expedite the scholarship application process, we hope that the remaining schools can send them in full within the next few days so that we can conduct a centralized review.

### Regarding the Embezzlement and Corruption of the Jianghai Customs, the Full Text of the Capital District Court's Judgment (Continued from Yesterday)

(3) Defendant Zhang Baohui's Part:

Upon investigation, Zhang Baohui was the lowest-ranking customs officer in the Import License Verification Section. According to his testimony to this court, he stated, "The import of galvanized iron sheets by Yi Feng & Co. was first mentioned by Yue Xinmin. I said that the merchant's commission was not our concern, but he said that Mei Futang and others were threatening him. I said you could resign. Later, Yue asked Zhang Yuan for help. I heard that Director Yin (referring to Yin Lansun) had also agreed. Later, Zhang Yuan sent US$1,500. This was due to the environment." Yin cunningly denied the joint extortion of property, and claimed that Yin Lansun had always opposed it. Later, in order to relieve Yue Xinmin from the coercion of Mei Futang and Zhang Gaozhen, he reluctantly agreed. Therefore, after the goods were taken away, Yin instructed me to cut off the signed parts at both ends of the license to prevent anyone from discovering who approved it," and so on. If this were true, it would be implausible that the defendants not only did not extort anyone, but were also threatened. Moreover, customs officers Yin Lansun and others, as well as the colluding former customs officer Zhang Yuan, repeatedly detained the slips, ordering Zhang Gaozhen to pass through Mei Futang, Shen Yanlu, Fang Maolin, and Mao Fengxiang. Each time it passed through a person, it was detained once and the extortion increased once. It was only after Lu Gengquan was subjected to their repeated extortion that he was able to retrieve the documents, as described earlier in the section on Yin Lansun. The amount of US$8,000 extorted and the amount shared with Yin Lansun can be considered as the actual implementation of jointly sharing the extorted property. As for destroying the license, although it was to destroy criminal evidence, it was a natural result of his criminal behavior and will not be separately punished according to law.

Regarding the Lifengyong pigment case, he testified, "Lifengyong declared on August 14, 1936. Before being ordered to pay attention on the 27th of that month, it was not necessary to submit it to Director Yin (referring to Yin Lansun) first. I did the initial review, and Yin did the final review. We got 70 million. I didn't ask for money in the Tianhe Taikang case. In the Minfu caustic soda case, we got US$3,000. We didn't get any money in the wool case." However, according to his confession, "Min stated to Zhang Yuan each time that things needed to be approved by the director (referring to Yin Lansun). Zhang Yuan paid without calculating, and stated that at most a little embellishment would be enough. As for the caustic soda case declared by Chen Liangbian, because of a distant relative relationship with Chen, out of consideration for face, after Zhang (referring to Zhang Yuan) and Chen discussed it, Director Yin agreed, and we got three to five thousand US dollars, which was later reduced to five hundred US dollars" (see Bureau Volume 2, page 99). This is inconsistent, which shows that the previous statements of "not getting money" and not asking for money were all evasions during the trial and cannot be believed. Judging from his words "at most a little embellishment would be enough," it is obviously a general intention to commit a crime. There is no doubt that he jointly and continuously violated his duties and accepted bribes.

(4) Defendant Zhang Yuan's Part:

This court heard Zhang Yuan's testimony, which stated, "In the Yi Feng white iron sheet case, Yue Xinmin brought the documents and specifically checked them with Yin Lansun, who said that they needed to be studied by the Import Control Committee and told me to return the license documents. Later, Yue Xinmin sent US$5,000. Yue Xinmin got US$3,000 alone, and asked me to take out US$500 to distribute to the people on the dock. Only then did Yin Lansun issue the documents and approve the import. Min, Yin Lansun, and Zhang Baohui each got US$1,500. In the Lifengyong aniline oil case, 330 million was sent. In the Tianhe Dakang pigment case, 90 million legal tender was sent. In the Yifeng wool case, 300 million was sent. Min divided 100 million with Yin Lansun and Zhang Baohui. As for the Minfu Company caustic soda case, a total of US$16,000 and 120 million legal tender were divided. Min, Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Kuanhui each got US$3,000. The remaining US$4,000 and 120 million legal tender were spent on the dock." This is generally consistent with the repeated confessions made during the investigations by the Bureau of Confidentiality and the Procuratorate of this court, and is also consistent with the documents attached to the case file. It is beyond doubt that as a non-public official, he jointly extorted money from Lu Gengquan with public officials, and participated in the acceptance of bribes in the joint and continuous violation of duties and acceptance of bribes by Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui. Furthermore, regarding Chen Lianggang's behavior of adding caustic soda to the license, he first obtained Chen's consent, which was also stated by Chen Liangxie, showing that he provided mental assistance beforehand. However, this was a method of participating in the above-mentioned breach of duty and acceptance of bribes, and should be judged according to the more serious crime of incitement.

The defendants Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui, in their capacity as customs officers, extorted money from Lu Gengquan on the pretext of a case, and used the former customs officer Zhang Yuan to pass it on and share the implementation, eventually dividing US$8,000 (the US$5,360 divided by the accomplices Fang Maolin and others is not included and should be handled in a separate case), which is extremely heinous. Although Zhang Yuan is not a public official, he should bear the same criminal responsibility according to law for jointly committing the crime. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan should each be sentenced to death, and Zhang Baohui's rank among the customs officers is lower. Because he was forced by the situation of Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan, he participated in the implementation. This court observed his words and demeanor and saw that he contained remorse, so he can be spared one death and sentenced to life imprisonment, and each of them should be deprived of their civil rights for life. Furthermore, the defendants Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui, in their capacity as customs officers, with a general intention to commit a crime, continuously committed several acts, jointly receiving bribes for acts that violated their duties, should be judged as one crime. Although Zhang Yuan is not a public official, according to the above explanation, he should bear the same criminal responsibility as Yin Lansun and others, so each should be sentenced to death. Zhang Baohui's circumstances are lighter, as mentioned above, so he is sentenced to life imprisonment, and each is deprived of their civil rights for life.

Upon investigation, the above-mentioned two crimes committed by the defendants have neither a general intention to commit a crime nor the same crime name, so they should be punished together. The prosecutor's indictment generally regards them as continuous crimes, committing the crime of receiving bribes for acts that violate their duties. This court should separately determine the crimes and impose penalties after changing their legal provisions, and determine the penalties to be executed. The defendants Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan are each to be executed. Zhang Baohui is sentenced to life imprisonment, and each is deprived of their civil rights for life. Of the property obtained by extortion, a total of US$13,360, except for the US$5,360 obtained by the accomplices Fang Maolin and others, which will be handled in a separate case, and the US$1,225 paid by Zhang Yuan, which was issued to Lu Gengquan by the Bureau of Confidentiality of the Ministry of National Defense for collection, the remaining US$6,775, converted into legal tender at the market price of 90,000 times per dollar at the time, totaling 600,975,000 legal tender, and the total amount of bribes received, totaling 1,505,000,000 legal tender, will be jointly and severally paid by the defendants, separately returned and confiscated (see Interpretation No. 1124 of the 29th Year of the Court). Regarding the returned portion, the victim Lu Gengquan has applied for a combined explanation.

Based on the above arguments, it is determined in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, Article 291 and Article 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 2, Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 7, Article 7, Paragraph 1 and Article 13 of the Punishment of Corruption Regulations, Article 28, Article 50, Article 56, Article 51, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 8, Article 37, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, as stated in the main text.

Prosecutor Tian Jihou attended the court to perform his duties in this case.

### The First Train on the Nanrao Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway

[Our Newspaper's Nanchang, 9th Telegraphic Dispatch] The bridge over Liangjiadu, the final and most arduous section of the reconstruction project of the Nanchang-Shangrao section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, was completed on the 3rd of this month. The first train from Shangrao to Nanchang completed its test run at noon on the 3rd and passed through the bridge at 1:00 PM, heading towards Nanchang.

"First to Open to Traffic" is a creed of the staff of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. They overcame various difficulties with their hard work and perseverance to complete the "road" and "bridge" projects.

Overview of the Mileage of the Entire Section

The entire section's mileage, from Shangrao to Xiangtang, is 119 kilometers, divided into four general sections, twelve subsections, thirty-eight bridges, and twenty-three stations. Under the goal of rushing to complete the work, the various projects have only completed a rough shape. There are still 68 kilometers of steel rails, some of which are 35 pounds, or 55, 60, 63 pounds of various types of light steel rails pieced together. The equipment for ticket sales and train operation, some of the switches have not been fully laid, the platforms have not been completed, or there are only a few simple office supplies. Currently, none of the stations in the entire section have electric lighting equipment or completed ticket office layouts. The train's telephones, route signs, flags, mileage markers, etc., are also being rushed to manufacture.

The Construction Process of the Large Bridge

The Liangjiadu Bridge project is second only to the Ganjiang Bridge in Zhangshu on the entire line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It suffered painful destruction during the war in May of the 28th year of the Republic of China. The first time the bridge was bombed into the river, the second time the piers were bombed away, and the third time even the bridge foundations submerged in the water were completely bombed away. Only in February of the year before last did the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway begin to clear the old beams and damaged bridge foundations. The clearing work was not completed until the end of October last year. Construction began in July, and the delay in the arrival of the steel beams made Director Huang Shouyi, who was in charge of the bridge work, very anxious.

In order to quickly achieve their mission, the bridge workers suffered from difficulties in funding, materials, and harsh weather. The steel beams ordered in Canada were originally scheduled to be delivered in June of last year, but the steel production in Canada after the war was greatly reduced and has not been delivered as scheduled. In addition to salvaging some old beams sunk at the bottom of the river for modification and patching, the bridge construction office also obtained a small amount of UNRRA supplies - steel beams. However, some of these steel beams were not of sufficient size, and some were of uneven height. Therefore, the steel beam of the fifth span was laboriously connected with 20-meter new steel.

The Bridge Workers Overcome Difficulties

The bridge is 502.70 meters long, with a total of fourteen spans, each span being 35 meters in length. Forty-one teams of people specialized in hammering rivets and drilling steel holes, with more than 100,000 holes drilled. From these drilling and hammering works, one can see the arduousness of the bridge construction. They completely relied on manpower to overcome the difficulties of lacking materials and tools. There was not a single crane in the entire project. To lift a section of the bridge weighing 80 tons from the river without a crane, they used self-made pulleys to lift it. The new steel beams, UNRRA supplies produced in Canada, were only 20 meters long, and there was a difference of 15 meters on the 35-meter bridge pier spacing. They painstakingly used the destroyed old beams to connect them. Because there were not enough tools, and also relying on manpower, it took three months to assemble one span of steel beams. Therefore, the work of hammering rivets and drilling holes was unexpectedly busy. Although the traffic is now open, they are still constantly hammering rivets.

Working in Heavy Snowstorms

How severe were the several heavy snowstorms! Director Huang Shouyi, who was in charge of the arduous project, and his more than 1,000 employees, were constantly working. As the project progressed to the final stage, they worked night shifts for more than a month. Some people's hair and beards grew long, because these unsung heroes did not have time to groom themselves. Director Huang Shouyi received the good news at the construction site that his wife was giving birth in the hospital, but he was unable to find time to return to Nanchang to take care of her for a moment. The newborn "Seventh Miss" was named "Jiancheng," which means "completion," to commemorate Director Huang's successful supervision of the construction of this large bridge.

Local Tyrants Show Their Might

Yingtan is the future transportation hub of the southeast. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Beijing-Jiangxi, and Fujian-Jiangxi railways will all connect here. Every inch of land on this small highland on the bank of the Xin River is a future base for construction and operation. There are already many merchants preparing to operate inns and transportation businesses there, but there is a force of "local tyrants" here who are unreasonably hindering the progress of these constructions.

With the victory of the return and the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to traffic, there has been a long time, but the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's ticket office has not yet been completed. All the staff of the station are squeezed into a small bungalow, handling their busy work day and night. The small office space is so crowded that they can hardly stretch comfortably. Every employee has to run a considerable distance to eat and sleep after completing their work, because there is no way to build their office buildings and dormitories. "Local tyrants" are hindering their work everywhere, for example: not allowing the oil press factory planned by the railway bureau in Yingtan to start work, not allowing merchants and local landowners to enter into lease contracts, and even restricting new houses to belong to the landlord after two years, and paying the landlord one dou of rice per foot of land per month. The "local tyrant" said: You can rent land to build houses, but you are not allowed to carry water and transport stones through my Gui family's land, and you must prohibit tenants from freely entering and leaving.

So many merchants are unable to solve the land problem, so they have not set up a transportation inn near the station since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway opened to traffic.

The lawless behavior of the "local tyrant" has increased the hatred of outsiders towards the natives. It is said that someone is brewing a resistance against the "Gui tyrant," which is likely to cause a bloody tragedy. We hope that the local authorities will pay attention to the evolution of the incident and the elimination of unreasonable facts.

The express train from Hangzhou to Shangrao on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will extend the original express train to Yingtan from the 4th due to the opening of the Nanrao section. From that day on, the traffic revolution will also begin to operate between Nanchang and Yingtan.

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is "First to Open to Traffic," should strengthen the "Safety First" measures in the future to enhance the safety of the railway and passengers. (Our reporter Liu Zao)

### Indonesian Thugs Kill Overseas Chinese; All Schools Compete to Teach Chinese

[Our Newspaper's Batavia, 10th Telegraphic Dispatch] Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands, Indonesian thugs in Java have resumed looting and killing overseas Chinese. In the past half month, thugs have attacked Zhiganbei, Sukabumi, Bogor, and other places, causing many casualties and property losses to overseas Chinese. On the 26th of last month, more than a thousand thugs suddenly attacked near汨水, killing and injuring more than a dozen overseas Chinese, burning down sixteen shops, and causing significant property losses. Last month, in the Lengjiabadong District of Sumatra, fifty-four overseas Chinese were killed by the thugs, their heads and bodies separated, a truly unbearable tragedy. It is investigated that during the ceasefire period, thugs actually looted and killed overseas Chinese, disregarding the law. It is hoped that the Republican and our government will quickly stop the violence, lodge protests, and effectively protect overseas Chinese.

The Dutch and Indonesian governments recently felt that China is one of the five world powers, and that Chinese is listed as an international language. Moreover, there are many overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, and the relationship is close. The Chinese Department of the Indonesian University in Batavia opened last month, and there are Dutch women among the students. Starting this semester, Dutch primary schools (referring to those with a majority of overseas Chinese students) will add ninety minutes of Chinese instruction per week. This semester, an Indonesian student entered the first year of junior high school at a Batavia middle school. Other schools also have Indonesian students enrolled, indicating that the Dutch and Indonesian people are paying attention to Chinese.

### A Bizarre Murder Case at Sandu Middle School; The Dean of Students' Beloved Son Goes Missing, Strangled to Death and Abandoned on the Beach

[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou, 14th Telegraphic Dispatch] In the last ten days of the twelfth lunar month, a shocking murder case occurred at the Provincial Sandu Middle School in Sanduao, Min. Huang Yuanxun, the dean of students of the school, had ordered some students with failing conduct grades to withdraw from school around the 24th. On the evening of the 24th, his beloved son (Weizhi) went missing. It was not until five days later that the child's body was found on the beach in front of the school. There were strangulation marks on his chest, proving that he had been strangled to death and abandoned on the beach. After the incident, the Sandu Water Police immediately investigated and determined that Chen Ziyin, a student from Fuding County among the withdrawn students, was highly suspected. They immediately invited the Ningde County District Procuratorate to arrest him and bring him to the county for interrogation. Note: The dead child was only eleven years old, and he was usually innocent, lively, and very lovable. His parents are distraught by his untimely death.

### Tao Gang Bandits Disrupt the Border Between Jiangxi and Anhui with 400 Men

[Our Newspaper's Nanchang, 8th Telegraphic Dispatch] Tao Gang's bandits have moved from the border of Xiuning, Wu Yuan, and Qimen in Anhui to Shewu Mountain on the border between Jiangxi and Anhui. The main peak of the mountain is in Xiuning County, Anhui, and its spurs extend into the counties of Fuliang (southern foothills), Qimen (western foothills), and Wuyuan (eastern foothills). Tao's bandits have taken this mountain as their base and are operating along the areas of Wangcun in Xiuning, Zhanggongshan in Wuyuan, and Meixi in Qimen. There are about 100 bandits in the Wangcun area, with more than 40 rifles. There are about 100 bandits in Zhanggongshan, with more than 50 rifles. There are more than 200 bandits in Meixi, with more than 100 long and short guns. It is reported that the entire bandit force has more than 400 men, 4 heavy machine guns, 4 submachine guns, 3 mortars, more than 30 short guns, and more than 200 rifles. A few days ago, more than 60 bandits and guns, including 2 light machine guns, 4 submachine guns, 6 pistols, and more than 20 rifles, moved from Rongkou Township in Qimen to Songjia Village in Xingfu Township, Fuliang County, looting property and then fleeing back to Qimen.

### Su County Army and People Enjoy the Spring Festival Together, Performing "Stilts"

[Our Newspaper's Su County, 11th Telegraphic Dispatch] In Su County, which has been hit by multiple disasters of floods, locusts, and bandits, more than half of the 1.3 million people are hungry, cold, and fearful. They do not seem to have a festive or tense feeling about the old Lunar New Year. The county government and the police bureau posted notices everywhere "Advocating Thrift, Prohibiting Gifts, and Severe Punishment for Violators," but the crowds carrying gifts in the streets and alleys were still bustling to and fro. Tea and food shops even announced that they were out of stock and closed their doors. The officers and soldiers of the 24th Division stationed in the area, the strong men of Shangqiu in the Pacific, took advantage of the Spring Festival to organize several teams of "stilts" to perform everywhere, and the army and the people enjoyed themselves together, adding a little vitality to this lonely mountain city.

### Dangtu Spring Festival Police Increase Posts

[Our Newspaper's Dangtu, 12th Telegraphic Dispatch] On the morning of the Spring Festival, the sunshine shone on every corner of the county, showing a vigorous atmosphere. During the Spring Festival, all circles are happily resting and spending this festival, but the security police team, the police bureau, and the Guqi Town National Soldiers increase their posts at night, and patrol without a moment's rest. On the vast sports field of the Confucius Temple in this county, various sundry items fill the road. The social theater performs three shows a day, and the seating is quite good.

### Suiyuan Army and People Celebrate the Spring Festival

[Our Newspaper's Guihua, 14th Telegraphic Dispatch] The army and people of Suiyuan are spending a happy Spring Festival in the province's stability. Since the border between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan has been stable, the communists have not played any tricks in the past ten days. In Guihua City, the drums and music were deafening, and firecrackers were deafening. Troops, stilt walkers, and little soldiers performed in the streets. Movie theaters, theaters, and photo studios are full of customers. The stores that were originally planning to close have been encouraged by this prosperous scene and will continue to struggle. The clouds of sorrow on New Year's Eve were blown away by the north wind, and after the festival, the ice and snow melted, and leather clothes became a major burden. According to the elders, the celestial phenomena were very good when welcoming the gods, which is a sign of a bumper harvest.

### Wuxian's Second Phase of Conscription Is Imminent

### A Glimpse of Tibet Since the Regency of Rongzeng Daza

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th airmail] Tibet, with an area of 1,215,788 square kilometers, is divided into Front Tibet and Rear Tibet. The capital of Front Tibet is Lhasa, the residence of the current Regent Rongzeng Daza, while Rear Tibet is Shigatse.

"Rongzeng" is an honorific term for "teacher" in Tibetan. Since Daza seized actual political power in Tibet in April of the 36th year (of the Republic), the monk Yisela of Razheng, a supporter of the former Regent, has been expelled from Tibet, and Pengkang Kalon has also been dismissed. The face of Tibet is now vastly different from the past.

In religion, the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama hold equal status, but in politics, all power is in the hands of the Dalai Lama, and the Panchen Lama can only be considered a local official. The political system of Tibet today can be explained by the following diagram:

The Four Ministers consist of three laymen and one monk. The name of the institution is "Kasha," which is the highest administrative organ in Tibet. Currently, the Four Ministers are: Lhalu Tse Kalon, Gesu Ba Kalon, Sokang Wangqing, and Rampa Lama. During the Qing Dynasty, when a vacancy occurred among the Four Ministers, the Amban (Qing Resident) and the Dalai Lama had to jointly recommend a candidate to the Emperor. Now, the Dalai Lama can resolve the matter with a single order.

The palace officials are similar to the attendants of the imperial court in the mainland. The heads of various departments of the three major monasteries have the same powers as senators. In the event of major events, the secretariat notifies the convening of temporary or regular meetings. The Four Ministers cannot attend the temporary or regular meetings. The Accounting Bureau, Military Affairs Department, Foreign Affairs Bureau, and Agricultural Affairs Bureau each send a representative, and palace officials and personnel from the three major monasteries and various monasteries must all participate. After the discussion concludes, it is submitted to the Dalai Lama for final decision. As for the "Foreign Affairs Bureau" subordinate to the Four Ministers, our highest authority has not yet approved it.

The organization of the Tibetan army is also quite different from that of the mainland. The highest commander is Lhalu Tse Kalon, the General Manager stationed in Qamdo. The name of this authoritative institution is "Majie," which can be said to be the Commander-in-Chief of the Tibetan army. The ranks below are Daiben, Ruben, Jiaben, and Dingben. Each Dingben has only 25 positions, while Daiben have 500 men. Therefore, a Tibetan Daiben is equivalent to a mainland battalion commander.

Our newspaper reporter has learned the following about the current number of troops in Tibet, the names of the commanding officers, and the locations where they are stationed: (See the Brief Table of Current Tibetan Army)

Unit Number | Commanding Officer | Location
---|---|---
1st Battalion | Baira Ba Daiben | Lhasa · Shigatse
2nd Battalion | Sokang Lado Daiben | Heihe
| Jingba Daiben | Lhasa
3rd Battalion | Mujia Daiben | Jiangda
| Yemu Dongga Daiben | Zhaya
4th Battalion | Cuoke Daiben | Gyantse · Shigatse
5th Battalion | Originally stationed in Gongjue, Qamdo, now transferred back to Lhasa
6th Battalion | Guotong Ba Daiben | Originally stationed in Seza, now transferred north to the Qinghai border
7th Battalion | Bulong Se Daiben | Leiwuqi (Northern Xikang)
8th Battalion | Xia Baba Daiben | Originally stationed in Jiangka, now transferred to Qamdo
9th Battalion | Datang Dege Se Daiben | Originally stationed in Qamdo, now transferred to Jiangka
10th Battalion | Rongga Bude Daiben | Gyantse · Shigatse
[Note] Each battalion is equipped with machine guns.

The current 14th Dalai Lama is only thirteen years old and is said to have to grow to eighteen years old before he can take charge of political affairs. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Razheng Kalon found the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in the home of a Sinicized Qi family in Qinghai. According to reliable sources known to our newspaper reporter, the fact that the 14th Dalai Lama came from a Sinicized family has led to endless disputes between Razheng Kalon and Rongzeng Daza. Although later Master Ma Yuanhai of Qinghai sent the 14th Dalai Lama to Lhasa to ascend the throne, which seemed to quell the matter, Razheng was eventually poisoned. In addition, the enthronement ceremony alone for the 14th Dalai Lama cost the National Government 400,000 rupees.

Since the Republic of China, apart from Li Dange Ge-she from Hunan Province in the eighth year of the Republic (Ge-she means Tibetan PhD, Li served as a Supervisory Committee member) leading a "Study Law Delegation" to Lhasa for investigation and research, no second investigation team has entered Tibet to this day. Li Dange Ge-she has long passed away, and Ouyang Zhi, who followed Li Dange in Tibet for eight years, has become the only Han Chinese in the mainland who is proficient in Tibetan affairs and is currently unemployed in the capital. As for the Tibetan commercial representatives currently in Beijing for discussions, it is indeed a first in the Republic of China and has extremely important implications. Delegation member Sokang Lado has always led troops stationed in the Heihe area at the intersection of Kang and Tibet, and is a pivotal figure in the Qinghai, Kang, and Tibetan border region. His father, Sokang Zhaza, is known for being pro-British in Tibet. His eldest son is Sokang Wangqing Kalon, and his son-in-law, Yutuo, is the former General Manager of Qamdo. Another member, Banda Yangbi, with the Han name Luo Shaoting, is proficient in Mandarin and somewhat literate in Chinese. His father, Chongben Yijiang (who was assassinated), was the founder of the Tibetan giant trading house Banda Chang, monopolized Tibet's import and export of wool trade, and served as the General Manager of Yadong in Rear Tibet. The Third Dalai Lama was indeed a prominent figure during his lifetime. (Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)

As the school year is approaching, the business of collecting tuition fees on behalf of schools will continue to be handled. The post office will start accepting entrustment from today. The methods are recorded as follows: (1) Once a school entrusts the post office to collect fees, the students of the school can pay fees at any post office in the city, without the need to travel far. (2) If the school is outside the urban area but within the Shanghai postal area, the local post offices in the jurisdiction can also collect fees on its behalf. (3) The fee payment forms are to be prepared by the schools themselves. If the post office needs to provide them, please contact us in advance so that we can print them according to the format. (4) The post office will notify the school of the tuition fees collected daily on the following day, so that they can be withdrawn at any time. (5) For other details, please inquire with the Savings and Remittance Business Group of the Administration and the directors of various post offices in the city.

### Six Middle Schools Enrolling Students Without Authorization, Municipal Education Bureau Has Banned

[Dahua News Agency] Recently, various schools have been advertising for enrollment in newspapers. In order to promote government orders and strictly manage private secondary schools, the Municipal Education Bureau has been closely monitoring the enrollment advertisements of various schools published in newspapers. It is learned that the following six schools have been banned by the Municipal Education Bureau for enrolling students without authorization or for misusing the registered wording: Shuguang Middle School in Tangqiao, Pudong; Liangjiang Middle School on Weidema Road in Jiangwan and Daji Road in Ximen; Zhenli Middle School on Yalu River Road in Hongkou; Jingxing Middle School at the entrance of Caoci Lane on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi; Hengmao Middle School in Baxianqiao; and Wudong Middle School in Yangjing.

### Home Economics Department of Girls' High School Should Be Improved in Practice, Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to be Notified

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Education Bureau believes that the establishment of the Home Economics Department for female middle school students was originally intended to improve family life, cultivate domestic skills, and develop work habits and interests. Therefore, operations such as clothing, food, housing, health care, nursing, childcare, gardening, and family management are all important items in junior high school practice. In high school, emphasis is placed on home care (including military care), which is especially important. However, because most students are accustomed to old habits, they often underestimate housework and are unwilling to study seriously. Teachers may only teach from books and fail to strictly supervise practice. Improving home life and fulfilling families are the foundations for social improvement and national construction, and should be given special attention. Therefore, all municipal girls' middle schools and private middle schools in this city, where girls' schools have a Home Economics Department, should make practical improvements. Middle schools with both male and female students must also gather female students and set up a Home Economics Department to meet the needs.

### Workers' Supplementary Schools Funded by Factories, Secretary-General Shen of the Municipal Government Said

[Our Newspaper] Secretary-General Shen of the Municipal Government gave instructions on the establishment of workers' supplementary schools at the 113th Municipal Administration Meeting, believing that this is a welfare undertaking of the factories for the workers. The Education Bureau can consult with the factories, and the factories are responsible for raising funds, while the teachers are appointed by the Education Bureau.

### Term of Employment for Teachers and Staff of Municipal Secondary and Higher Education Institutions Has Been Stipulated, Initial Appointment for One Semester, Renewal for One Academic Year

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Education Bureau has recently stipulated the term of employment for teachers and staff of municipal secondary and higher education institutions and ordered all municipal middle schools, municipal junior colleges, municipal vocational schools, and municipal normal schools to be notified. The term of employment for teachers and staff of municipal secondary and higher education institutions is stipulated as one semester for initial appointments and one academic year for renewals. In the future, when schools submit employment contracts for teachers and staff, they should prepare a detailed list stating the "name," "date of arrival," "start and end dates of previous employment," and "start and end dates of current employment." The names of the teachers and staff on the submitted employment contracts should be consistent with the personnel dynamics report. If there are any changes from the previous report form, a copy of the dynamics report should be submitted at the same time, indicating the replacements.

### Tuition Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools in Shanghai are About 10% Higher Than Those in Nanjing, Private Highest Fee is About 4 Million, Private Primary Schools 1.5 Million

[Our Newspaper] As the start of this semester is approaching, it is reported that the tuition standards for primary and secondary schools in Nanjing for this semester have been passed by the municipal government meeting, stipulating 800,000 for municipal high schools, 700,000 for junior high schools, 3.6 million for private high schools, 3.2 million for junior high schools, 1.1 million for private elementary schools, and 900,000 for primary schools.

Director Li of the Shanghai Education Bureau invited Chen Baotai of the Municipal Party Department, Zhou Feicheng of the Municipal Education Association, Jiang Jizhou of the Private Primary and Secondary Schools Association, etc., to discuss the issue of tuition standards for primary and secondary schools in this city for this semester at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chief Secretary Peng of the Bureau, Chief Xie of the Middle School Division, Section Chief Ye, Chief Zhu of the National Education Division, and others were also present. After exchanging views at the meeting, it was believed that the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai are not far apart, and the cost of living in Shanghai is slightly higher than that in Nanjing. Therefore, the tuition standards for primary and secondary schools in this city are in principle similar to those set by Nanjing, and at most, the figures set by Nanjing will be increased by about 10%. The total amount of fees will increase by about three times compared with the previous semester. Director Li will ask Mayor Wu for instructions in the next few days, and then the official figures can be determined.

Director Li believes that the tuition standards for private primary schools set by Nanjing seem to be too different from those for middle schools. The highest tuition fee for private primary schools in this city this semester is about 1.5 million: the highest tuition fee for private high schools is about 4 million. The fee figures for municipal schools will also be determined and announced in the next few days. The Education Bureau will ban some private schools that have already set tuition figures and charged students.

### An Elderly American PhD Serves Our Education, Chairman Chiang Awards Jingxing Medal

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th Airmail] Dr. C. Bertram Rappe came to Sichuan from the United States in January 1909. At that time, Dr. Spencer Lewis was preaching in Zizhong. When he was studying at Northwestern University in Chicago, he became interested in China. He began studying Chinese in 1910, which made it very convenient for him to become the head of Qiujing Middle School in 1912. In the 36 years at the school, he cultivated more than 20,000 outstanding students. Today, Master Yang Chongxi, the principal of Qiujing Middle School, and Dr. Zhang Lingao, the president of Nanjing Jinling University, were his proud disciples in those years.

This 67-year-old slender doctor is unwilling to be lonely; he has reached retirement age, and only returned to China for recuperation for two years after the victory. He and his wife, Ms. Grace, returned to Chongqing together on November 7th last year. His current position is consultant to Qiujing School and director of Kuanren Hospital. He told our reporter: "China is my second hometown, and I want to serve China for another four years." This doctor will not retire until he is 71 years old. According to his current health condition, at that time, he will definitely "serve China for another four years."

Dr. Rappe is a devout Christian. During the Anti-Japanese War, his main work was to preside over the following five relief agencies: (1) United China Relief, (2) American Advisory Committee, (3) International Famine Relief, (4) Committee on Aid to University Faculties, (5) American Red Cross. In addition to the fourth University Relief Committee, he was the accountant for the other four units. He said: During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the American people provided a total of 8.5 million US dollars in aid to China.

Qiujing Middle School was founded in the 17th year of the Guangxu reign. The first principal was Dr. Lewis, and Dr. Rappe was the sixth. The first Chinese principal was Xiao Jiren, and the current principal, Yang Chongxi, is the eighth. Qiujing School includes kindergarten, primary school, middle school, and business school (the business school has been around for eight years and will soon be expanded into a business college). In addition, Dazhou Middle School was also established in Neijiang in the 27th year of the Republic of China. Soon, an agricultural specialized subject will be added, and after the equipment is enriched, it will be changed to an agricultural college until a complete university is established.

February 14th was the greatest glory in the lives of Dr. and Mrs. Zhang Dulun, the mayor of Chongqing, and He Beiheng, the director of the Sichuan Construction Department, presented two Jingxing Medals on behalf of Chairman Chiang. When the reporter asked Rappe what he felt, he replied amiably:

"I really don't have any experience with this kind of thing; too many good friends have asked, and I'm really a little embarrassed." (Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)

### Third Shanghai-Hong Kong Football Match, Shanghai Team Loses Again, Hong Kong Western Union Wins 1-0

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 14th dispatch] In the third Shanghai-Hong Kong football match in Hong Kong, the Shanghai team lost to the Hong Kong Western Union team 1-0 today. The first half was 0-0 with no score.

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] On the Lunar New Year's Day, the Hong Kong-Shanghai football match was held at the Happy Valley Stadium. The stands were full of fans. The ticket prices were divided into three types: ten yuan, five yuan, and three and a half yuan, with a total revenue of more than 26,000 yuan. Hong Kong Governor Sir Alexander Grantham presided over the opening kick-off. Before the game, the national anthems of China and the United Kingdom were played, and the atmosphere at the venue was very harmonious. As a result of the battle, the Hong Kong team retained its victory with a score of 5-1. The Hong Kong team also took the lead in the first half with a score of 2-1. In the second half, the Shanghai team lost three goals. The game was not tense. The Hong Kong team overwhelmed the Shanghai team with a transcendent attitude.

Comparing the lineup of the two teams, the Shanghai team should not have lost 5-1, even if they lost. The reason is that the two defenders, Yan and Wu, were out of shape, and Qu Yongfu's defense in the middle was completely ineffective. With these loopholes in the defense, it was impossible to resist the Hong Kong team's attack. On the forward line, the two inside forwards did not run back to the backcourt to get the ball, and the Hong Kong team controlled the entire midfield advantage. Especially in the second half, the entire formation was cut into two sections, and the advance and retreat were out of order, but Zhang Banglun still had an excellent performance. The loss of five goals was beyond human rescue. If Banglun could reduce his fancy showmanship, his future would be limitless. Zhang Jinhai played the best for the Hong Kong team. He and Song Sheng stood in the midfield and completely gained the midfield advantage. The forward, Jiana, was the most popular, and both wings seized opportunities to go deep. Wen Zhi and Yi Jie responded loudly in the middle, forcing the Shanghai team to be beaten passively. From the performance of the whole formation, the Hong Kong team was fast and sharp, while the Shanghai team was slow and chaotic. The methods of communication and cooperation were difficult to compare with the Hong Kong team.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 14th dispatch] The Shanghai International Football Team lost to the Hong Kong Western Union team 1-0 today. The Shanghai team performed well, but unfortunately, the team was not lucky. In the last few minutes, the Shanghai team had four shooting opportunities, but none of them hit the goal. Zhang Banglun was still the best in the Shanghai team in terms of personal technique. The Hong Kong team's goal was scored by right inside forward Keningham. Most opinions believe that this goal should be ruled offside.

### Hao Gengsheng Arrives in Shanghai Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th dispatch] Because of various matters related to the preparation of the National Games, which need to be actively carried out, Hao Gengsheng will go to Shanghai on the 15th to contact the mayor of Shanghai and convene a preparatory committee meeting.

As a result, Xinsheng defeated Zhejiang University with a score of 23 to 9. The second game was between Qingbai and Kongxiao. The referees were Chu Yusheng and Hu Shixuan. Kongxiao was good at mid-range shooting. In the first half, Kongxiao took the lead with a score of 27 to 16. Qingbai counterattacked in the second half. With three minutes left, there was still a difference of seven points. Kongxiao was, after all, a newcomer to basketball, and was in a state of panic. Qingbai regained six points. As a result, Kongxiao won by one point with a score of 40 to 39. The Winter Games suspended the charity tournament for two days due to the rain affecting the results of the charity tournament.

### Shantown Team Forfeits Last Night; China United Wins Without a Fight; Jia Shen, Keh Hsi, Green Morning White Also Absent

In the Group A basketball league, there were originally three matches yesterday, but two teams forfeited, leaving only the Group B Jia Shen versus foreign team Green one. In the first match, Group A Morning White did not have enough players, and Indian won without lifting a finger. However, Morning White has forfeited twice, and according to the rules, their qualification has been revoked, and their past results will not be counted. In the final match of Group A, China United was scheduled to play against the Shantou team. However, the Shantou team telegraphed that they were forfeiting. Thus, China United won with a score of 2-0, achieving eight wins in eight matches and dominating the group.

In the only remaining match, Group B Jia Shen played against foreign team Green. Jia Shen's Tao Ying-shih first broke the ice, but foreign player Xuteh-Gufu missed the penalty shot. Tao scored again, and Liang Hsiung-piao made one out of one free throw, giving Jia Shen a 7-0 lead. Green's Sateh-Gufu and Senna-Gufu both scored, prompting Jia Shen to call a timeout and replace Tao Ying-shih with Wang Chieh-ping. Green became even more demoralized, allowing Jia Shen to dominate. Liang Hsiung-piao, Sun Moses, and Lu Miao-sheng, among others, excelled, and the score increased rapidly. Only after 18-4 did Xuteh-Gufu make two free throws. Before long, the first half ended, with Jia Shen leading 22-7.

After changing sides, Jia Shen replaced Wang Chieh-ping and Yen Shih-fan with Shih Cheng-chung, Niu Yin-mao, and Teh Yin-mao. Green's Senna-Gufu both scored with throws and penalties, adding three points. Then, he made two more free throws. Jia Shen hurriedly put Wang Chieh-ping and Lu Miao-sheng back into the game, replacing Shih and Niu. Taking advantage of the unstable situation, Green launched a major offensive. Although Jia Shen called two timeouts, Liang Hsiung-piao only managed to score one point, allowing the foreign team to close the gap to 22-24. Fortunately, Jia Shen stabilized their play and was not overtaken. After 30-24, Jia Shen became active again, and Green struggled to catch up. By the end of the match, Jia Shen defeated the foreign team with a score of 47-28, achieving five wins in five matches. With only two matches left against Tung Wah and Central Air Transport, they can complete their dominance. The Group B championship is firmly in their grasp.

[Our Newspaper News] All industries resumed trading yesterday after the Spring Festival holiday. A bull market opened, with prices generally rising. The market's money supply is very stable. A total of 29,453 checks were cleared, with a total amount of 1,439,916,017,000 yuan. The four banks and two bureaus experienced a difference of 85.4 billion yuan, due to the frequent turnover of chips in bull market trading for various industries.

[Another Report] The North-South rice market resumed trading yesterday. Under close scrutiny from all parties, a bull market opened. Rice merchants mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market was stable with few transactions. The Bureau of Social Affairs originally planned to sell 100,000 dan of rice on the market, but refrained from doing so.

Rice Yesterday's registered arrivals at the South Market were 1,599 shi, and at the North Market, 2,219 and a half shi. White rice was priced at 1.75 million yuan, thin indica at 1.72 million yuan in the South Market and 1.75 million yuan in the North Market. Early indica was priced at 1.7 million yuan in the South Market and 1.71 million yuan in the North Market. Yanghsien was priced at 1.75 million yuan, and special grade japonica was priced at 1.77 million yuan in the South Market and 1.78 million yuan in the North Market. None of these prices exceeded last year's closing prices.

Grains Flour prices rose sharply at the opening but retreated quickly before closing. High-priced transactions were canceled, resulting in a net increase of over 10,000 yuan. Bran initially rose but then fell, with a slight increase of over 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake owners were firm, and Shantou welcomed inquiries, resulting in a sharp increase of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans varied, with northern demand being acceptable but local demand being flat. Duhuang rose slightly by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and Hankou yellow soybeans showed slight strength. Customer soybeans soared by 1 million yuan.

Broad beans saw low supply and demand, with a price increase of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Mung beans saw activity in the northern markets, rising another 1 million yuan. Sorghum saw little activity, with a steady increase of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Corn in Qingdao continued to be in high demand, soaring by over 1 million yuan, but easing at the close.

Raw peanuts were being purchased by the Guangdong merchants, leading to rising prices, soaring by 2 million yuan. Sesame in Tianjin was being targeted, with high local demand and limited supply, leading to a rapid surge of 2 million yuan.

Oil market sentiment remained strong, with all oils rising successively by 1 million to 2 million yuan.

Yarn and Cloth Yesterday, the cotton yarn market opened with a bull market. Due to positive news, customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions were actively purchasing. Local traders also showed interest. Although factories slightly increased sales, demand exceeded supply, causing prices to rise frequently. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn soared by 5 million yuan compared to before the holiday, reaching 65.5 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose sharply, ranging from 2 million to 5 million or 6 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cloth market experienced bull market trading for the new year. People were generally optimistic, and local traders were eager to cover their positions. Traders from the north also made some purchases, and retail investors also absorbed a large amount. Prices rose sharply due to the surge in the yarn market. Later, after 10:00 AM, the Textile Construction Company offered a large supply, causing prices to fall slightly. However, the prices of 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloths still soared by 150,000 to 120,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. The prices of other cloths also rose across the board.

Silk The artificial silk market saw a slight increase yesterday. 120-count Asahi silk opened at 98 million yuan and closed at around 8.5 million yuan at noon. However, due to the silk factories not having resumed work, there was no demand, resulting in very little trading. In the afternoon, it was offered at 8 million yuan.

Factory silk remained closed yesterday. Due to low buying and selling activity, although there was a desire to sell, there were no buyers. Although one or two parties were interested in purchasing, the prices were harsh, resulting in no trading outside the market.

Silk fabrics The silk fabric market rose yesterday. China Strong True Silk quilt covers opened at 43.1 million yuan for immediate delivery and 43.7 million yuan for Monday delivery. Great Honesty goods were 200,000 yuan higher, and American Asian goods were 300,000 yuan higher than Great Honesty goods. Due to very little trading, closing prices remained unchanged. Great Honesty checkered crepe was 185,000 yuan. The factory prices of other goods were mostly not yet released.

Sugar Taiwan Sugar started selling on the 12th, with prices increasing by 60,000 yuan and quotas remaining unchanged. As for the association's allocation, trading officially started yesterday, with most prices rising by about 10%. However, medium sugar was weaker.

Tea Tea prices were chaotic yesterday, with little actual trading. Due to it being the weekend, there was very little buying and selling. According to general opinion, expectations for the new year's bull market were high due to the scarcity of goods.

Timber Timber prices for the new year saw foreign pine rise by 15% compared to last year, and fir rose by 10%. Judging from the market conditions, the opening prices were stable.

### Inspection of Bank Operations

If Errors are Found in Operations, Inspectors Should Correct Them Immediately

[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that, in order to enhance the efficiency of bank operation inspections, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated a regulation regarding matters that inspectors should supervise and rectify when inspecting banks. The regulation requires that if there are errors in the operational management and accounting processing techniques of various banks, money shops, and firms, the original inspectors should supervise the inspected entities to rectify and report them promptly in order to achieve timely results. However, since its implementation, many inspectors have proceeded with inspections, but many have also failed to effectively supervise and urge rectification. The National Bank has been instructed to refer to the previous case and implement it thoroughly. It is reported that the Audit Department of the National Bank has already issued a circular to its branches, instructing inspectors to comply with it thoroughly.

### Taiwan Sugar Shipments to Japan Still Borne by Japanese Vessels

### Interest Rate on Deposit Reserves for Banks and Firms; National Bank Decides to Appropriately Increase; Uniformly Calculated at Weekly Interest of Five Points

[Our Newspaper News] In order to alleviate the cost burden on commercial banks and firms, the Central Bank has decided to appropriately increase the interest rate on deposit reserves. It was previously changed from a weekly interest of two points to be calculated according to the approved lending and deposit interest rates, approximately around a weekly interest of four points. Now, because the industry still feels that it is insufficient to compensate for losses, it has been decided, after considering the actual situation, to uniformly calculate it at a weekly interest of five points. In addition, the fixed-term deposits for the same industry offered by the bank were originally set at a monthly interest of eight points. Now, in order to adapt to the needs of the industry due to the high hidden interest rates in the market, it has been changed to one corner and two points. The unit amount of the deposit remains at 100 million yuan, and the term remains at seven days. As for the interest on current deposits for the same industry, it has also been increased from eight li to one point and two li.

### Internal Exchange Rate Revision

The proposals passed included the contract for contract weaving of cotton cloth and contract dyeing of cotton cloth, and the waiver of inspection procedures for cotton yarn used by the affiliated cloth factories of various yarn mills. In addition, discussions were held on advancing the purchase of American cotton and exporting yarn and cloth in exchange for foreign cotton, in order to facilitate supply.

### Three Measures for Southern Transportation of Yarn and Cloth Officially Abolished from Tomorrow

The Yarn Control Committee recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Yarn and Cloth Transportation to South China," "Application and Examination Regulations for Yarn and Cloth Transportation to South China," and "Simplified Regulations for Issuing Certificates for Yarn and Cloth Transit," which were promulgated by the Textile Industry Management Committee under order, have been forwarded to the Executive Yuan for official abolition. The committee has issued a public announcement that all of the above three regulations will be abolished from February 16th of this year.

### Measures for Handling Safekeeping Funds

[Our Newspaper News] According to the newly revised National Treasury Receipt and Expenditure Accounting System, it is stipulated that the safekeeping funds of various agencies should be handled as "Special Fund Deposits." The National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance previously convened relevant agencies to jointly review and revise the "Provisional Measures for the National Treasury's Handling of Safekeeping Funds of Various Agencies," and the department submitted a special report to the Executive Yuan, which was forwarded to the National Government for approval and filing. Before the order was received, the key points of the meeting's records were first notified to the branches for preparation. It is now learned that the measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan and have been submitted to the National Government for filing. The original measures are recorded as follows:

1.  On the date of implementation of the new National Treasury Receipt and Expenditure Accounting System, the National Treasury shall change the handling of pension funds, guarantee deposits, temporary receipts, receivables, and other funds of a safekeeping nature, which were originally handled under the public treasury "Public Treasury Safekeeping Funds" account, to the "Special Fund Deposits" account for safekeeping funds.

2.  The following funds shall also be handled according to the provisions of the preceding article when various agencies deposit them into the National Treasury:

    (1) Operating funds of publicly owned and operated agencies and operating expenses of publicly owned enterprises.

    (2) Funds withdrawn from the treasury according to law, which are not immediately used in full.

3.  Receipt and payment of safekeeping funds shall be made with receipts (Attachment 1) or remittance slips (Attachment 2) and checks (Attachment 3).

4.  Except for those originally stipulated as non-interest-bearing, the remaining safekeeping funds shall be given interest by the depository banks at their discretion.

5.  The use of safekeeping funds may be exempt from the review and signature of resident treasury auditors.

6.  In addition to handling the receipt and payment of safekeeping funds in accordance with the provisions of these measures, the National Treasury shall still handle the treatment of treasury accounts in accordance with the general provisions for special fund deposits.

7.  These measures shall be implemented after approval.

### Applications for Re-Purchase of Wool Exceeding Deadline Will Be Confiscated

[Our Newspaper News] The Transportation Control Committee previously announced that the 60-day deadline for applying for re-export of wool arriving at the port with foreign exchange but without a permit, expired on February 9th of this year. Due to the special circumstances of the old lunar new year, an extension of 10 days was granted to allow merchants to complete the application and purchase procedures. Recently, the committee received an order from the Executive Yuan, stating that if they fail to comply within the deadline again, the goods will be confiscated and publicly auctioned.

### Cigarettes Sell Briskly

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with bull market trading. Due to Yong Taihe dispatching Qianmen Nanwei high-grade cigarettes and dispatching foreign-made Tonghang Great Britain Old Knife two cigarettes, the atmosphere in the market was quite strong. The sales of various cigarettes from Chinese manufacturers were also good, and prices were also brisk. At the end, ten cigarettes Great Britain Old Knife two cigarettes rose by 2.3 million to 2.4 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The prices of other brands of Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose. Only Qialike Three Five Nanwei and other cigarettes had a flat market.

### Soap Soars

For daily necessities, the soap market soared because manufacturers had not yet announced dispatch news, and sales at door shops were extremely brisk. Traders were actively purchasing, and it was also heard that raw materials were in short supply. With new purchases active, the prices of various goods reached new highs. Jiecai Guben soap soared to 2.7 million yuan, a sharp increase of 270,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. Arrow Knife soap rose by 200,000 yuan. The markets for other soaps and matches were also firm.

Another report: The atmosphere outside the market was even stronger. Guben soap was traded at a high of 3.08 million yuan, Arrow Knife at 2.83 million to 2.84 million yuan, and Huang Xiangmao at 1.93 million yuan. The prices of other soaps had to be increased by 300,000 yuan above the listed price in order to trade. Fire matches The price of the Beautiful brand has been raised to 13 million yuan.

### Jewelry Stores Partially Reopen

The city's jewelry industry has been closed for a long time. Now, because the Bureau of Social Affairs has approved 146 stores to operate, they have all partially reopened yesterday. For the time being, they are limited to exchanging old gold jewelry for new gold jewelry, with an additional fee of 500,000 yuan per tael. The labor cost varies depending on the fineness of the jewelry, ranging from 200,000 yuan to 1 million yuan per tael. As for the sale of new jewelry, the authorities have not yet made a specific decision on labor costs and other items, and the jewelry stores are still temporarily not selling. The Financial Management Bureau attaches great importance to the reopening of jewelry stores and has decided to continue its efforts to crack down on the black market for gold.

### Fish Market Sales Stagnant, Prices Drop by 30% with No Buyers

During the old lunar new year, the city's fishing boats surged in, including 13 fishing boats from the Fishing Management Office and six pairs of fishing boats from various private companies, fully loaded with fresh fish, totaling more than 20,000 boxes, docked at the fishing market wharf, waiting to be unloaded.

The market was closed for two days as usual for the spring festival. It opened for trading early the day before yesterday (the 12th). However, because restaurants and canteens had not yet reopened after the old lunar new year, and the general public had already prepared plenty of new year goods and did not need to buy more, only over 3,000 boxes were sold, and the price dropped by about 30% compared to during the year. Even the fish vendors were hesitant to buy.

Yesterday (the 14th) afternoon, the market specially invited the responsible persons of various fishing boat companies to discuss the matter. As a result, in addition to the market still trying to promote sales as much as possible, the Fishing Management Office and China Aquatic Products Company decided to first deliver a portion of the fish, about 3,000 boxes, to the fishing market's first refrigeration plant for cold storage, in order to adjust the supply.

### Major Investors Act Decisively; Chinese Stocks Continue to Advance

Chinese stocks were still performing well yesterday, encouraged by the money supply. Namely, Yongshas had more purchases than sales. After a long period of brewing, major investors in the industry acted decisively and boosted it. The stock suddenly became very popular at the close. Small-cap stocks such as Xinguang also showed signs of standing out. Unless there are special setbacks in the future, there is still a possibility of higher prices.

In the early morning, there was some hesitation due to reports that the cotton inventory had to be purchased by the Textile Construction Company and that unapproved interphones were being investigated. At the opening, both glory and shame were seen. Wuhe, due to a notice of traffic congestion, was temporarily suspended from trading in the afternoon, and even went up in a falling posture. Xinyi and Hengfeng were also involved, but did not trade. Yongsha debuted at prices of 744 yuan and 760 yuan, which was quite mediocre. After opening, with the support of bull market trading, it rose from 743 yuan and 760 yuan, advanced by 89, 71, and 65 into instant delivery, 134, 22, 71, and 105 advanced into deferred delivery, rising to 762 yuan and 774 yuan. 84 and 68 settled current delivery, the price fell to 752 yuan and 764 yuan, 35 and 89 advanced instant delivery, 134, 180, 76, and 105 advanced deferred delivery, rising to 764 yuan and 782 yuan. The external interest rate still opened at three corners, one and a half cents, and three corners, six cents. With the addition of the increased telephone inspection, 71, 183, 97, 157, and 125 all sold instant delivery, 99 also settled, retreating to 757 yuan and 772 yuan. However, 71, 134, 207, 16, 89, 4, 202, 190, 173, and 104 purchased instant delivery in succession. 36 came in after going out, and 105 and 232 advanced deferred delivery. Near noon, it rose to a high price of 776 yuan and 793 yuan, and then closed at 774 yuan and 791 yuan. Xinguang had a large number of buyers, as did Tongyi, which quickly caught up and made progress. As a result, compared to the previous close, instant delivery stocks Yongsha, Xinhe, Zhongfang, Tongyi, Meiya, and Xinguang each rose by about half a percent. Zhongni, Hengfeng, Lian, Shangping, and Wuhe returned after falling to the limit, rising slightly. The rest rose slightly. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Yongsha rose by slightly less than half a percent, and the rest rose slightly. Among the unlisted stocks outside the market, except for Dasheng, which continued to decline slightly, the rest were still mediocre.

Government bonds generally fell back yesterday. Tongbing opened at 82,000 in the morning and ended at 74,000 after reaching 86,000. Rooms 360 and 555 bought, while rooms 500 and 552 sold. Room 503 went out and then came in. The turnover was still only about 1 million. Compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi fell by 7,000 yuan, Tongbing fell by 11,000, Dingzhong fell by a little less than 8,000 yuan, and Tongwu fell by 9,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks had few transactions yesterday, and the trend was still towards prosperity. Yisha rose to 660,000 after opening at 620,000, then retreated slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha, British Allied, Yeguang, Paper Edition Shipping, and Steel all rose slightly. Huizong fell slightly, and Yipi rose by about half a percent. Miscellaneous stocks had no bids.

### New Year's Message

— Ding Jiwan

Dietary Moderation and Hygiene

The importance of dietary hygiene has been known since ancient times. The Inner Canon states, "Eat and drink with moderation, live with regularity, and do not work recklessly. Therefore, the body and spirit can be united, and one can live out their natural lifespan." Another saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth." Therefore, apart from external infections, the number of diseases caused by diet should not be small.

It is now the new year, and according to customs, we first have the "New Year's Eve dinner" at the end of the year, and then the "Spring Wine" at the beginning of the year. Relatives and friends invite each other, and there are frequent banquets. There are no empty evenings, and stir-fries, roasts, and braised dishes are all mixed together. At first, one can indulge in these feasts, but after many banquets, even with a full table of delicacies, one may feel dry-mouthed and tasteless, and respectfully decline.

The capacity of the human stomach is ultimately limited. How can it withstand greasy and viscous foods, refusing nothing? When the stomach is full and digestion is difficult, few people will not suffer from food poisoning.

Furthermore, it is customary for Chinese people, regardless of their usual circumstances, to cook a large amount of food during the New Year to prepare for a large feast. Some even store more than half a month's worth of delicacies. If this is not enough to flaunt their wealth, then what is? But consider that if food is left for too long, all the nutrients will be lost, or the taste will become sour and spoiled. Eating it is harmful to hygiene, and abandoning it is a waste of resources. Why not prepare a smaller amount and add fresh vegetables at any time? Wouldn't that be best of both worlds?

I strongly advocate that during this time of frugality, it is not necessary to visit each other frequently. Instead, we can promote group meals once or twice. Not only is it not wasteful, but it is also greatly beneficial to hygiene. What do health experts think of this?

### Women's Abdominal Pain

— Shen Zhongli

Reflections on Ovary Removal

Abdominal pain in women is an extremely common ailment. Since publishing an article on this, numerous patients have sought consultation. Although it cannot be said that all were completely cured, the prescriptions provided often led to pain relief and regular menstruation. This is a helpful insight. Consequently, the differences in treatment between Chinese and Western medicine, as well as the effectiveness and positive/negative consequences, are beneficial for patients in clarifying diagnoses and ensuring safe treatment. I will discuss these in detail to benefit readers.

'Daily Abdominal Pain': The pain has no fixed time. The most obvious symptom is pain in one or both sides of the lower abdomen, such as on the upper thigh or in the iliac fossa, with a hardened mass. It is painful to the touch and may even form a palpable mass, accompanied by lower back pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination. Some cases are due to injury from abortions. Western medicine diagnoses these as fallopian tube inflammation, fallopian tube hernia pain, or fallopian tube abscesses. Oral administration of blood-activating, qi-regulating, and stasis-resolving remedies often results in a cure.

'Menstrual Abdominal Pain': Menstrual abdominal pain is called dysmenorrhea. It can occur before, after, or during menstruation, or even in the middle of the menstrual cycle. The pain is located in the center of the lower abdomen or moves from side to side, sometimes even resisting touch. Breast distension indicates stagnation of liver and spleen qi and blood stasis in the uterus. Western medicine diagnoses these as uterine inflammation. If the pain is localized to one side, either left or right, it is often due to imbalance of the penetrating and conception vessels and blockage of the collaterals. Western medicine diagnoses these as ovarian inflammation, sometimes accompanied by fallopian tube inflammation. The treatment method is similar and should focus on activating blood, regulating qi, and using menstrual-regulating medications.

In summary, for both types of abdominal pain, treatment should emphasize blood-activating and pain-relieving remedies. I often prescribe medications that directly target the uterus, such as amethyst, Trogopterus dung, Vaccaria seed, and tangerine seed, which are particularly effective. According to patients, Western medicine sometimes recommends removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes, initially removing one. However, based on my clinical experience, unless the diagnosis is confirmed to be a tumor, pain often persists on the left side even after the right ovary is removed. However, administering decoctions to clear stasis and regulate qi often leads to a cure, and the patient can maintain their original health and fertility. Oral administration of penetrating-vessel-activating and meridian-invigorating remedies is similar to the Western medical method of clearing the fallopian tubes. Therefore, the reflection on ovary removal may not necessarily be good. This is a factual observation. The goal of treatment is to maintain health, and cautious surgical implementation applies to both Chinese and Western medicine. However, clear diagnosis and whether to use oral decoctions or surgery should not be ignored.

### External Symptoms in the Neck

— Zhu Renkang

The neck contains lymph nodes (called Shao Yang meridian in Chinese medicine), and below that, the thyroid gland. Lymph nodes are crucial for defending the body against pathogens. They are located at critical points. Mild cases lead to elimination of pathogens, while severe cases lead to accumulation and stagnation, forming swollen nodules. Furthermore, the resulting symptoms vary depending on the type of pathogen. Careful differentiation and treatment are necessary.

[Wind-Phlegm] [Monkey-Phlegm]: Wind-phlegm originates in the neck, while monkey-phlegm develops under the chin. It starts as a single nodule, the size of a walnut, white and not very red, with some pain. It usually suppurates within one to two weeks and is relatively easy to cure.

[Cheek Ringworm] [Neck Ringworm] [Ear Root Ringworm]: Cheek ringworm starts on both cheeks, neck ringworm in the neck, and ear root ringworm under the ear. Initially, there is redness and swelling, and the pain is severe, accompanied by chills and fever. If it does not resolve, it will suppurate within seven to ten days. Early treatment of the above conditions can often resolve them, and even if pus forms, they are relatively easy to cure and are considered mild conditions.

[Scrofula]: Also known as "rat neck." Nodules appear in the neck, one or more, without any pain. Improper treatment often leads to ulceration and drainage of yellow fluid after many months or years. This condition requires patient treatment and adequate nutrition. Even if ulceration has occurred, there is still hope for a cure. Inquiries for treatment are welcome.

[Consumption Failure]: Relatively rare and occurs in people over forty. It is actually a malignant lymphoma or tuberculosis. It also develops in the neck and is hard like iron. Over time, it ulcerates, and the sores are concave and convex, discharging bloody fluid, leading to a hopeless situation. This is the most serious of neck disorders.

[Goiter]: Commonly known as "thick neck." It is actually a swelling caused by excessive thyroid gland development and abnormal secretion. The neck gradually enlarges, resembling a hanging gourd, and may fluctuate with mood. Treatment is usually ineffective, but it does not endanger life.

### Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cough

— Cheng Guoshu

I suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis for three years in my early years. In addition to artificial pneumothorax, I tried all kinds of Chinese and Western medicines. I believe that nutritional therapy can indeed help strengthen the body and enhance resistance, unconsciously eliminating tuberculosis. At the very least, it can promote the proliferation of connective tissue around the lesions, surrounding the tuberculosis bacteria and depriving them of their survival conditions, gradually leading to their elimination. Now, I will list the main symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis and corresponding medications, so that those suffering from this disease will know what to choose.

'Cough': Cough is a reflex symptom and should not be suppressed. The focus should be on moistening the lungs, which means calming the lung lobes. Medications include Adenophora stricta, Ophiopogon japonicus, bird's nest, lung dew, and pear juice. For those with phlegm, add phlegm-resolving ingredients such as apricot kernel, Fritillaria cirrhosa, clam powder, Polygala tenuifolia, and Platycodon grandiflorus.

'Hemoptysis': Hemoptysis is related to cough. Coughing causes lung vibration, making blood vessels prone to rupture, resulting in hemoptysis. If the cough persists after hemoptysis, the rupture is difficult to heal. Hemoptysis can easily increase fever, worsening the condition and weakening the body. Hemoptysis in pulmonary tuberculosis is often caused by coughing, with bright red blood and bubbles, which is very different from stomach blood, which is dark purple and mixed with food residue. Medications include ten ash pill, Panax notoginseng powder, Rehmannia glutinosa, Asini Corii Colla, Biota orientalis leaf, Agrimonia pilosa, lotus root node, and Fabae semen flos.

'Tidal Fever': If pulmonary tuberculosis cough is accompanied by tidal fever, the condition is serious. High and continuous fever indicates a critical condition, severely depleting body fluids. Medications include Lycii radicis cortex, Artemisia annua, Paeonia suffruticosa cortex, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, and Eupolyphaga seu Steleophaga.

'Night Sweats': Night sweats are often accompanied by steaming bone fever and tidal fever. However, steaming bone fever does not diminish with night sweats, and persistent night sweats further weaken the body, promoting fever increase. Medications include dried persimmon calyx, wheat bran, Glycine sojae semen testa, and oyster shell.

### On Chinese and Western Writing

— Wu Yong

In his article "Sighs of Disaster" in this newspaper on the 8th, Mr. Jingwen discussed fundraising in China, stating, "As a Chinese commoner, how much disaster relief donation (direct or indirect) one has to bear in a year is probably something no one can calculate." He also stated, "Indeed, because society is a collective group, and humans have a responsibility to help each other, the form of fundraising does not necessarily reflect the meaning of disaster. For example, in European and American societies, in addition to charitable fundraising for religious causes, academic and cultural fundraising are also very common… However, the fundraising over there is mostly constructive and full of hope. An academic organization is created from donations, a university is maintained by donations…”

This argument is quite correct. We see and hear too many negative and destructive things every day, and we cannot but admit that positive and constructive things are scarce. To illustrate this, one only needs to look around to understand, no need for examples to be clear. I remember a fable in the Collected Works of Ice-Drinking Studio. The gist is: an official died, and the King of Hell wanted to punish him. The official claimed that he had been honest and incorruptible in the human world and had not defrauded the people of a single coin. The King of Hell told him: Being an honest official is your duty. You are being punished because you did not have good political achievements. If being an official only required honesty, then the stone lion in front of the courtyard, which drinks no water, would be much more honest than you!

Liang Rengong's words emphasize the effectiveness of governance and have a Western flavor, not entirely a Chinese perspective. In our common biographies, for all who have been officials, there are always these two sentences: "An honest and upright official with remarkable political achievements." The so-called "remarkable political achievements" are nothing more than "an honest and upright official." In the past, Chinese officials were content with not being harsh or disturbing the people. Once they retired, the people under their governance would always be reluctant to let them go, kneeling on the ground to see them off at the ten-mile pavilion. This shows how easy it was to be an official in our country and how content the people were. I remember a certain legal authority in the country told his students: When you go out to be officials in the future, it would be great if you were a little more content than other officials. It would be very good if you didn't do bad things. These words were actually born of profound experience and were a kind of helpless statement.

Chinese people lean towards negativity, while Europeans and Americans lean towards positivity. This can be seen most clearly in Chinese and Western writings. I had not paid attention to this before. A friend of mine was recuperating in a deep mountain temple, reading Chinese and Western books while sick. Because the environment was quiet and his heart was clear, he saw a difference between Chinese and Western writings. He wrote to me saying: "...Reading Western magazines and articles, I often find works that inspire ambition and delight the mind. The best of our country's writings are full of killing intent, and the inferior ones are about women and money. This is the result of the chaos in the country, and the resentment can also be a source of future chaos..." After that, I paid more attention to the writing style of foreign articles and felt that my friend was right. Western articles always express optimism between the lines and seem to have a way to solve problems. They don't make a fuss over nothing and have the image of the rising sun in the sky and sunlight on the ground, which is comfortable to read. Even expository and revealing texts seem to be relatively calm and peaceful, with little arrogance or eccentricity. They always specifically point out the inappropriate parts, describe the source of the disease in an orderly manner, actively propose solutions, and then optimistically express that the problem can be satisfactorily resolved.

Most of our current articles are empty and irrelevant. As for critical texts, their intention to destroy is greater than their intention to establish, often causing a dark, terrifying, and unpleasant feeling. Some attack the current situation in a sweeping manner, expressing complete dissatisfaction with it. Where is the current situation bad? No specific points are made. What can be done to solve it? No constructive methods are proposed. It seems that they are just expressing that the patient has a third- or fourth-stage lung disease and is absolutely incurable. Some, however, adopt a vague method, either attacking from the side, or going around in circles, or making long detours, or pointing at the mulberry tree and scolding the locust. As a result, writing has mostly lost its spirit of neutrality and peace and has lost its grand and imposing image. Apart from personal venting, what good does this kind of writing do? Still others adopt a method of escaping reality or covering up the truth. When it comes to a critical point, the article ends sorrowfully and changes the topic. Therefore, no matter how much you say, it always feels like you are not hitting the nail on the head, as if you have drawn a dragon but not bothered to dot the eyes. This phenomenon is not unrelated to the current environment, but what I don't understand is why they must write this kind of article that dares not be sincere? If they don't write it, can't they reduce the reader's revulsion a little?

I always feel that this kind of article lacks sunshine and is an unhealthy state. Although it may be said that it is due to the oppressive environment, I am afraid that this is not entirely the case. You only need to read our country's poetry to know that there is very little optimism, and most of them are always gloomy, melancholic, and sentimental. It is either complaining or mourning, either sadness in autumn or mourning for the dead. Why can't we sing more praises of spring and always be so dull?

I am not advocating singing praises or embellishing the present. I am only saying that sighing and complaining, full of sorrow, and only thinking about the bad is not a way to solve problems. Whether in writing or in spirit, we must first have an optimistic, enterprising, and constructive heart, and then we can hope to achieve the goal of construction.

### "God"

— Yi Yuechu

"God" is just an "image" of man.

"People" have great differences, and "Gods" also have great differences.

Western "Gods" are just "people" who are relatively beautiful or strong. They have joys, sorrows, love, and war, they live among "people", and they also die.

Eastern "Gods" are detached from the "people" of society, they have no emotional fluctuations, they live in heaven, and they never die.

Human beings are all peace-loving, so eliminating violence and maintaining peace is often the responsibility of Gods, whether Eastern or Western, it is all the same; however, in the process of punishing evil, Western Gods rely on their wit and courage; Eastern Gods rely on "magic treasures" and spells. In other words: the power of Western Gods has its limits, while the Eastern Gods are omnipotent.

In terms of appearance: Western Gods, men are strong and powerful, women are young and beautiful; but Eastern Gods, mostly men are old men with immortal demeanor and gradually white whiskers, women are fragile young ladies.

From the difference of "Gods", we can deduce the difference of "People".

### Duty

— Xi Bu Nuan

In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese presented the Twenty-One Demands, threatening Yuan Shikai. The whole country was indignant, and the Chinese students studying in the United States also organized and advocated declaring war on Japan. Letters and telegrams were exchanged, and they were very generous. Only Hu Shih at that time maintained calmness, advocated ethical resistance, and did not make meaningless sacrifices. He wrote an English letter to the "Chinese Students in America," and his important words were:

"I think that at present, students should be calm and complete our duty to study. We must study for the future construction of our motherland. The future of the motherland will definitely need us!"

We dare not make any judgments about what the situation was like at that time. Hu Shih was greatly criticized at that time, and many people even wrote letters scolding him and specifically stated that he should not be elected during the election. We know that under the abnormal psychology of the masses, sometimes it is difficult to speak. This shows that Ibsen's grumbling is not meaningless, "The majority is always wrong, and the minority is right." Here, we do not deny the usefulness of excitement and generosity. For example, the May Fourth Movement and the July 7th Resistance War emotions erupted at the time and could not be stopped no matter what. The ancients called it "If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?" That is the truth. However, we must always admit that this phenomenon is very unusual and not normal. One person's emotions cannot be in a state of madness for a long time, and a country or a community does not want to be agitated all the time. We must know that the impact of a wave is often not temporary, and the merits and demerits must be judged in decades, hundreds, or even thousands of years - sometimes, it is simply never clear.

Not just myself, but for most people, what they are seeking and hoping for is "peace"? Lao Tzu's small country with few people was in response to the warring states period of fighting for cities and land. Mozi's universal love and non-aggression was in response to killing fields. These are all diagnoses and treatments for the disease, so it is inevitable that the words are excessive; that is, the correction is always overcorrected. The Confucian school put forward the creeds of benevolence and righteousness, and also said, "Live in your position and act," "If you are not in that position, do not plan its affairs," and so on. The meaning here is not to stand by and do nothing, not to take responsibility, but to express that a citizen has his own duty, and should not act rashly, nor should he not act. Thinking about it carefully, although human society claims to be organized and in order, since the relationship is built on "ruling" and "subordination", the way to maintain it is very problematic. Not only "the gates of the princes, benevolence and righteousness are in them," but who doesn't look at the emperor with envy? A gangster becomes an emperor, and Shusun Tong leads a group of literati to practice court etiquette. This is inevitably a tragedy, but it is inferred that the reason why gangsters became emperors is actually because the literati or the general public failed to fulfill their duties. If the division of labor in society is very clear and the rights and obligations are fair and reasonable, then why do wars arise, and bloodshed is even more unnecessary. But what is said about the division of labor and rights and obligations is a matter that will never be clear, and it cannot but be blamed on the confused intellectuals.

People often lament the large number of illiterates in China, but some people say sarcastically: "There should be fewer scholars, look, it is these guys who do bad things! 100% of the uneducated people are authentic good people." This makes us blush. Who is responsible for corruption, perversion of the law, and treason? It is the common people who pay this debt, so the common people are unfairly treated there. Why are the intellectuals so bad? You can of course simply and clearly tell me: "The problem of life." In fact, this is not entirely the case. Not only are some corrupt people rich, but even when life was easier to maintain in the past, there were still many who scraped the land. In my opinion, this is just a "restless" psychology at work. The first is being restless about life. They don't produce as much as others, but they want to enjoy as much consumption as others. Therefore, although we can't even cast steel rails, there were not few cars in 1948. Society calls this enjoyment being trendy, and the height of money is used to measure personality. How can the atmosphere be good? The second is being restless about duty, which is divided into two types, one is purely duty, and the other is the morality of service. Appointed officials envy recommended officials, and recommended officials covet specially simplified officials. What they admire is nothing more than being able to have more money and power, and not to fulfill greater responsibilities; as for morality, I probably don't need to mention it, you can all understand it. The ancients took each living in peace as the minimum condition for governing the country, but now everyone is restless. Real life and psychology are all a word of delusion. Suffering is suffering in vain, and enjoyment is even more outrageous, but it is inevitable that the pedantic theory of doing their best to guard their duty will be ridiculed by revolutionaries, which is really impossible!

### The Bridge of Chinese and Western Music

— You Ting

I believe that the achievement of the Central Broadcasting Orchestra is not what is generally believed to be "promoting national quintessence," but it is doing "the bridge of Chinese and Western music." In simple terms, it is to gradually let the audience who can only appreciate Chinese music understand Western music.

Most Chinese people have cursed Western music. When the former Municipal Council Orchestra (now the Municipal Symphony Orchestra) first performed in Shanghai, the Chinese called it "wasp calling." Their hearing would easily erase the three-dimensional interlaced beauty of "flowing architecture" in Western music - the highest realm of modern music art, which is not found in Chinese music.

Now, the Broadcasting Orchestra uses a weekly method to persuade those who hate modern music. This method is: referring to the form of a Western orchestra, using Chinese instruments to form a Chinese Orchestra, for example: the string part includes high-pitched erhu, middle-pitched erhu and low-pitched erhu, which are exactly equivalent to the violin, viola and cello in the Western orchestra; in terms of music, the symphony form of Western music is used as the form; first there is a theme, and then it is developed, and the whole song is divided into four movements, but the spirit (flavor) of the music is still oriental. For example, the song "Sugar Seller" (performed at the Shanghai Jin Cheng Theater on the 6th), first uses a piccolo to play the theme, and then other instruments respond and change, describing the story of a sugar seller with a child theme, which is similar to "descriptive music" in Western music. Another example is the song "Ling Shan Vatican Sound", which also completely imitates the form of a symphony, using the slow, medium, fast, and rapid tempos in sequence, and the use of "harmony", "counterpoint", and the wonderful use of musical language to imply the omnipotence of the Buddha, which is exactly "program music" in Western music.

In addition, the adoption of the conductor system, the staff notation method, and other playing skills all come from Western music. On the surface, the Broadcasting Orchestra is an incarnation of the Western symphony orchestra, but the number of instruments is less, the instruments themselves are still "Chinese", and the content of the music is Chinese.

However, the audience will never think that this is Western music, and they feel that this more complex Chinese music is indeed more interesting than the original Chinese music. Therefore, they feel the primitiveness and backwardness of the original Chinese music. The so-called "ancient elegant music" can only occasionally satisfy the emotion of "reminiscing about the past", and its essence is anti-progressive.

This effect of "improving national music" is to introduce and explain the value of Western music. After accepting this kind of national music, the audience will naturally gradually understand the three-dimensional beauty of modern music and will not be as arbitrary as before. Therefore, we will generally accept using modern progressive instruments and progressive methods to express our national music, and not necessarily discuss nationality with instruments.

In the incident of the eleven-hole new flute (created by the Academia Sinica) adopted by the Broadcasting Orchestra, we are told two more things: first, this new flute has complete semitones, free transposition, and complete emotional expression, which can be used for ensemble. It is enough to prove that the original six-hole flute is incomplete and unreasonable, and there is no need to strengthen the defense. Second, although this flute is similar to the Western flute, it has no opening and closing device, which is inconvenient to play; it is enough to prove that the improvement of Chinese instruments to the extreme is at most equal to Western music. In fact, this is the case in all improved Chinese musical instruments. This is because these primitive musical instruments are mostly the distant ancestors of modern musical instruments. Musical instruments only have the difference between progress and no progress, and there is no distinction between nationality.

The future of Chinese new music is very clear: it is to accept the methods and instruments of Western music while retaining its inherent national characteristics. The Central Broadcasting Orchestra is using Chinese instruments to educate people to understand the methods and values of Western music. This work is worthy of praise.

### Liberation

— Fang Ji

A Jew who was exiled from Germany to the Soviet Union walked with his son past Lenin's tomb. The son asked him who Lenin was. He said, "Lenin? He is the one who liberated us from the chains! Do you remember? Mother's gold chain and my heavy gold watch chain?"

### The豫 Opera of Lanzhou (Part 1)

— Junzuo

Outside the Shuangcheng Gate of Lanzhou can be said to be the only entertainment venue for the common people. There are various storytelling venues and local theaters. Among them, there is a豫 opera theater that sings Henan opera, called the Zhongzhou Theater, and its business is particularly good.

Last autumn, I listened to a Henan opera. I was a bit uncomfortable with a theater covered with a low reed mat and a stage full of beggar-like costumes. I didn't expect to endure until the last play, and it seemed like a fresh flower suddenly emerged from the desert. There was a female actress who, although not necessarily beautiful, had truly reached the pinnacle of perfection in her singing and performance. This actress is named Song Shuyun, and she was originally a famous star in豫 opera.

It is said that although a Henan troupe's box office is booming, it is still losing money and is not easy to sustain. Friends in the cultural circles of Lanzhou (including me), firstly, knew that some people have been engaged in the movement to improve豫 opera in recent years, and secondly, felt that there are still some talents in豫 opera, especially female actors. Shanghai can innovate Yue opera, so why can't Lanzhou improve豫 opera? As a result of exchanging opinions in several cultural conferences, it was decided to try this approach. It happened that the Northwest Military and Political Headquarters News Department had this intention. The News Department has a sound drama team, and it might as well control a local theater group to serve as a sharp tool for promoting national culture. The time was gradually ripening.

More than two months after I left Lanzhou, I returned to this ancient city of ice and snow! When I stepped into the豫 opera theater again, I was very pleased to see that the theater was actively developing its work under the guidance of the News Department of the Military and Political Headquarters and had changed its name to Xinguang豫 Opera Theater. Although it was still the reed mat shed, it had been decorated, the order in the theater was better than before, the beggar costumes were no longer seen, and the red actresses flaunted brand-new costumes, and the general actors were also much more tidy. Henan opera, or Zhongzhou opera, is now very popular in Lanzhou, overwhelming all local operas (Qin腔, Jin腔, Ping opera) and Beijing opera. It only performs one night show every day, and every show is sold out.

In Lanzhou society, in recent months, whether officials and dignitaries, literati and scholars, peddlers, wives, and young ladies, almost everyone has regarded豫 opera as an excellent topic of conversation, especially the two great Kun actors of豫 opera—Song Shuyun and Wang Jingyun—are praised to the skies, and they are invisibly divided into Song and Wang parties. Several newspapers exaggerate it even more, and it is very lively. As a result, the general public's interest in豫 opera has increased, and the theater's doors have been broken several times.

In this way, a wave of artistic criticism has risen. How to reform豫 opera into a modern drama has become the theme of today's drama lovers in Lanzhou. In Shanghai, the local opera Yue opera is popular, but it seems that no one mentions豫 opera? But I dare to assert that this kind of豫 opera, a typical art of the Central Plains, does have its own value. As long as it can keep up with the needs of the times, strive for progress in itself, and have a few outstanding talents, I dare to assert that the future of豫 opera will definitely surpass that of Yue opera.

Since豫 opera is one of China's local operas, it naturally represents local characteristics. The so-called local characteristics are to reflect the local people's feelings and the desires of the general people's lives. Therefore, the fact that豫 opera is full of Henan sentiments is precisely its characteristic. To a certain extent, this characteristic should not only not be destroyed, but should also be promoted. However, the people's feelings and life desires of a place change with the times, so a drama should not only maintain its local uniqueness, but also maintain its progressive nature of the times. How can豫 opera be an exception?

The focus of reforming豫 opera seems to be grasping the above two principles. Let me solemnly introduce Mr. Fan Cuiting, a modern Henan drama reformer with knowledge, enthusiasm, and perseverance. The new豫 operas he has written and personally directed have reversed the old stereotypes of previous local operas and strongly express the following characteristics:

(1) It is rich in national revolutionary consciousness and advocates enthusiastic patriotic sentiments, such as "Glorious Return from Overcoming the Enemy," "Female Envoy," "Washing Away Shame with Blood," and "Ye Hanyan."

(2) It is rich in the democratic revolutionary color of anti-feudalism and anti-corruption, such as "Couple Arrows" and "Hate in the Sky."

(3) It is rich in anti-old etiquette and has a subjective desire to actively improve the social status of women, such as "Ambition," "Three Flings of the Sleeves," and "Female Envoy."

(4) It advocates women first and love supreme, such as "Female Chastity Flower" and "Ye Hanyan."

Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (70)

Little Wang's mother smiled and said, "If you don't tell Mr. Xu, you can tell me. When the driver comes back, you can ask him to pick up the boss." Qiwan said, "There's no need to send a car to pick me up. I'll come back by myself." Little Wang's mother said, "It's cloudy today, and I'm afraid it will snow. The weather is very cold. Boss, put on a coat before you go out." Qiwan shook her head and said, "No need, I won't get cold!" Saying that, she left in a hurry. Little Wang's mother sent her to the door and saw that she didn't take a car either and walked straight out of the alley. She was very suspicious. She thought that Qiwan had never acted like this before, and today, she didn't know what was going on, and her attitude and expression had completely changed! Little Wang's mother returned to the room and was just puzzled in her heart. After an hour, Zhuzhai came. When he saw that Qiwan was not at home, he asked Little Wang's mother where the boss had gone. Little Wang's mother said, "I'm puzzled in my heart. I don't know where the boss went. The boss always tells me where she's going and the phone number when she goes out, but she didn't tell me a word today. The weather is bad today, and she didn't go out in her own car. I'm really worried." Zhuzhai listened and just frowned, pacing around the room. After a while, he asked, "Did anyone come to see the boss today?" Little Wang's mother said slowly, "Yes, there was, but I don't recognize him. He was an old man. He talked to the boss for a while and then left!" Zhuzhai didn't pay attention at all and said, "I don't think the boss has anything else to do. She will definitely come back early, because I made an appointment with her to come and find her at Tiande Department Store at 5:00 this afternoon to buy a carpet. The boss wants to buy a blue carpet, and only this department store has it. I'll call her and tell her to go together." Little Wang's mother listened and just pursed her small mouth, smiling ambiguously, and said, "It's already 4:30 now. In half an hour, it will be 5:00." Zhuzhai ignored her and just wandered around the room. When he saw that 5:00 had passed and it was dark, he still didn't see her come. At this time, it was snowing heavily outside. Little Wang's mother called everywhere to inquire, and they all said she hadn't arrived. Zhuzhai was very anxious. Little Wang's mother served the meal, but Zhuzhai couldn't eat it. He waited until 10:00, but Qiwan still hadn't returned. Zhuzhai suspected that she had been dragged to the theater by a friend to see a play. He personally called each theater to inquire, and they all said she hadn't come. Zhuzhai rubbed his hands and said to Little Wang's mother, "I'm really worried. I haven't seen her anywhere. Now the snow is so heavy, and she didn't go out in a car. The snow is thick on the road, and it's not easy to walk. What if she gets hit by a soldier or falls into a ditch! I have to go out and find her." Little Wang's mother said, "Xu Guangsheng, where are you going to look for her?"
