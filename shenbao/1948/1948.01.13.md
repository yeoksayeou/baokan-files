### Kowloon City Incident Suddenly Worsens; Hong Kong Police Actually Shoot Our Residents; Foreign Minister Wang Lodges a Strong Protest with the British Side

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 12th (Urgent Telegram)] An unexpected incident occurred in Kowloon Old City this morning, where Hong Kong police again took armed action against residents of the temporary shacks in Kowloon Old City. This unfortunate incident has further exacerbated the Kowloon issue. Five of our residents were injured by rifle bullets, and Hong Kong police also used tear gas, injuring several other residents. The incident occurred on the morning of the 12th when fully armed Hong Kong police attempted to enter Kowloon City to continue demolishing houses. Residents, fearing for their safety, came out to resist, but were immediately met with gunfire and tear gas from the Hong Kong police.

Cheung Chung-wu, a representative of the Kowloon Residents Association, was the first to be shot in the head during the resistance. Two of the five injured residents are women, and all have been rushed to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. According to the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, the Hong Kong authorities did not provide prior notice of their intention to demolish the temporary shacks built by our residents. These temporary shacks were only intended to provide temporary shelter. At the time of the dispatch, a large number of Hong Kong police were still stationed in Kowloon and the urban area, guarding against our impoverished residents rebuilding their homes, and the tear gas fumes had not yet dissipated. According to official investigations, six Kowloon City residents were injured after the Hong Kong police force took coercive action. Their names are as follows: Seriously injured: Leung Chuang, Wong Lai-fung-ying; Slightly injured: Cheung Chung-wu, Cheung Bing-lam, Lau Sam-mui, Sun Yat, etc. Although the exact number of deaths and injuries resulting from the Kowloon City police's use of tear gas and rifles against our compatriots in the city's temporary shacks this morning to force their relocation has been carefully investigated, it has not yet been determined. The Hong Kong government claims that five people are currently receiving treatment, while reliable sources say two are seriously injured and four are slightly injured. According to a villager who witnessed the incident, at least six people were injured, and a child, whose name was not included in the list of deaths and injuries, was also slightly injured. The hospital treating the injured was also unable to provide the necessary information. The head nurse, nurses, and information desk staff at the hospital consistently refused to disclose the number of injured to reporters.

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 12th (Telegram)] According to Hong Kong sources: After the incident of Hong Kong police shooting our Kowloon City compatriots, the residents' cries shook the heavens, and the situation was extremely serious. As a result, the Hong Kong side has banned reporters from using Hong Kong-Guangzhou long-distance telephone lines.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 12th (Telegram)] After the wooden huts in the Kowloon Old City area were forcibly demolished by the Hong Kong authorities on January 5, the residents rebuilt about twenty thatched huts on the original site. On the morning of the 12th, the Hong Kong authorities sent 150 police officers to demolish them, leading to a clash with about one hundred residents who occupied the area. The occupants threw stones at the police officers, who retaliated with tear gas, batons, and handguns, resulting in a fierce battle lasting half an hour. Finally, all twenty thatched huts were demolished, leaving only a Chinese national flag on the broken walls and ruins. The area is currently guarded by police officers.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th (Telegram)] It is reported that Foreign Minister Wang received a report this afternoon stating that the Hong Kong government had continued to send armed police into Kowloon City and harm Chinese people, which aroused great anger. Minister Wang immediately summoned British Ambassador Sir Steven to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sternly demanded that the London government immediately instruct the Governor of Hong Kong to cease all coercive actions in Kowloon City during this period of negotiation and to no longer allow the police to enter the city. Further discussions will be held after a detailed report on today's incident arrives. Minister Wang also urged the British side to accept all the written requests submitted by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 8th of this month, and the British Ambassador agreed to immediately telegraph the London government. It is also reported that the Ministry has telegraphed Chairman Song of Guangdong to provide necessary relief to the Kowloon City residents who have suffered.

### Regarding the Kowloon City House Demolition Incident: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Protest Letter of the 8th Urges Britain to Pay Attention to the Good Relations Between the Two Countries

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th (Telegram)] Regarding the Kowloon City incident, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to the British Embassy on the day after the forced demolition occurred, and then on the 8th of this month, it submitted a protest and request to the British government in writing. The original text is as follows:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs extends its greetings to the British Embassy and states the following: Since the Hong Kong government ordered the Chinese residents in Kowloon City to demolish their houses on November 27, 1947, public opinion in various parts of China has been greatly agitated. In addition to instructing the responsible personnel and the special commissioners stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi to negotiate with the British Embassy and the Hong Kong government on several occasions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed to the British Ambassador to China in person on December 10, 1947, the hope that the governments of China and Britain would value the maintenance and promotion of friendship between the local people and the Hong Kong government, and that the Hong Kong government would also take the same attitude, avoiding any actions that have the opposite effect or are provocative. On January 5 of this year, police and coolies from the Hong Kong-Kowloon Brigade, armed, entered Kowloon City and forcibly demolished dozens of houses of residents in Kowloon City, and arrested two representatives of the wealthy residents. There were no proper arrangements for the poor residents who had no one to turn to, leaving them to sleep in the wilderness without a home. Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to Mr. R.H. Le Mare, Counselor of the British Embassy, on January 6, and stated to the British Ambassador on the same day that the matter was both a treaty issue and concerned with humanitarianism. The establishment of the Kowloon Leased Territory was based on the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory signed in 1898, which stipulated that "All Chinese officials and troops now stationed in the City of Kowloon shall continue to occupy their present positions therein..." and also stipulated that "it is further understood that no walled city now existing within the Kowloon Extension shall be interfered with." According to this provision, the power of administration over Kowloon City should naturally belong to China, and the British government should not force the residents of the city to move their residences. The Hong Kong government issued a statement on September 15, 1946, stating that from the date the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory came into effect in 1898, Kowloon City was part of the British-leased territory during the lease period and belonged to the scope of British sovereignty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately issued a public statement on September 18 of the same year, reiterating the Chinese government's position that it has never abandoned its administrative power in Kowloon City. The Hong Kong government's coercive action this time in forcing the residents of Kowloon City to move is based on the grounds that the land on which these houses are located belongs to British Royal Government land. This reason clearly disregards China's administrative power in Kowloon City, which it has never abandoned, and the Chinese government will never recognize it. The Chinese government also believes that the Hong Kong government's move to forcibly demolish the houses of Kowloon City residents is also in conflict with the long-standing friendship between China and Britain and their peoples. The Minister of Foreign Affairs reiterated to the British Embassy in China that, according to the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898, the Chinese government still enjoys administrative power in Kowloon City and has no intention of abandoning that administrative power. The Chinese government will never consider legal all measures taken by the British government in the past and in the future that violate the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898. If the British government has a different interpretation of the Convention, it should seek a fair and reasonable solution through normal diplomatic channels. Regarding the Hong Kong government's forced demolition of Kowloon City residences, it is requested that the British government immediately order the Hong Kong government to release the arrested residents' representatives, stop further arrests, and properly resettle the residents who have suffered damage this time. Accordingly, it is requested that you examine this matter, promptly convey it to the British government, and provide a reply.

There are no regular troops left in southwestern Shandong. Local troops are stepping up their efforts to suppress the remaining bandits in an effort to completely pacify this corridor area, which is a transportation hub for both northern and southern communists.

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 12th (Telegram)] The remnants of the 11th Column of Liu's bandits fled southwest from Dingtao on the 11th and arrived in the Liuzhuang area of Liuhe.

### The Yangtze River Midstream River Defense Meeting Will Be Held in Jiujiang on the 15th; The Yichang-Hanshui River Defense Command is Established in Shashi

[This Newspaper, Nanchang, 12th (Telegram)] Minister Bai Chongxi is scheduled to convene a joint meeting on Yangtze River midstream river defense and security in Jiujiang on the 15th. Chairman Wang Lingji of Jiangxi inspected Xiushui and Wuning in northern Jiangxi on the 12th and returned to Nanchang. He will travel to Jiujiang to attend the joint defense meeting.

[This Newspaper, Changsha, 12th (Telegram)] The rumor that a unit of communist bandits near Jianli crossed the Yangtze River and fled south is completely untrue. The lakeshore counties are as peaceful as ever.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th (Telegram)] It is learned from the Executive Yuan that the Hanshui-Yichang River Defense Command has been established in Shashi, which is responsible for presiding over the suppression of bandits by the 2nd Bandit Suppression Column. The column has jurisdiction over 5 regiments of the Hubei Security Force, a unit of the Water Police, and 4 regiments of the Hunan Security Force. The defense of Shashi is consolidated and there is no cause for concern.

[This Newspaper, Nanchang, 12th (Telegram)] Bandit activity in the border areas of Guangdong-Jiangxi, Hunan-Jiangxi, and Anhui-Jiangxi is increasing. The bandits in the Guangdong-Jiangxi area have now fled to Guidong in Hunan Province and are planning to flee to Suichuan and Yongxin in western Jiangxi. A band of bandits in Wuyuan on the border of Anhui attacked Fuliang in northeastern Jiangxi. Currently, most of the Jiangxi Provincial Security Regiments are responsible for the defense of northern Jiangxi. The defense of other areas with bandits is deeply felt to be insufficient. Although there is a collective discussion on joint defense with neighboring provinces, it is still felt that a clever woman cannot cook without rice. How to strengthen border defense and pacify the local areas is indeed an important issue for Jiangxi Province at present.

[This Newspaper, Changsha, 12th (Telegram)] The Hunan Provincial Government has scheduled a joint meeting of the general and deputy captains of the self-defense forces of various counties on the 16th to discuss strengthening the security of the counties. The captains of the various security brigades will also attend. Chairman Wang will rush back from Guangzhou to preside over the meeting in person.

### Expenses for Aid to China and Far Eastern Countries: $440 Million USD – U.S. President Releases Budget Figures

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Yanzhijin Mountain, 12th broadcast: President Truman's budget document to Congress (fiscal year 1949) was released on the afternoon of the 12th (1:00 AM, Shanghai time on the 13th), with the following precise figures: The State Department's portion totals $7 billion USD, of which, besides a portion allocated to designated institutions, $4.4 billion USD will be used to aid Europe and other countries. Within this $4.4 billion USD, $4 billion will be specifically allocated to European countries, and $400 million will be allocated to China and other Far Eastern countries.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman submitted to Congress on the 12th a total budget of $39,669,000,000 USD for the 1948-49 fiscal year to meet actual domestic and foreign needs. This expenditure is an increase of $2 billion USD compared to this year and is unprecedented in peacetime. The main reason lies in implementing an international plan to respond to unprecedented challenges. The President declared: The United States must maintain a higher budget figure until it fulfills its international responsibilities to pave the way for a world of peace and prosperity. Seventy-nine percent of this represents the aftermath of World War II and efforts to prevent World War III, with national defense and foreign aid being the largest components. National defense expenditures require $11.1 billion USD, accounting for 28% of the total, while foreign and other international affairs expenditures require $7 billion USD, accounting for 18% of the total. Expenses for European recovery and aid to China and other countries are $4 billion USD for the former and $440 million USD for the latter. In addition, there are $1.25 billion USD for the occupation expenses of Japan, Korea, and Germany.

### U.S. Figures Advocate Lending Silver to Our Country

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Amid the clamor for currency reform, this reporter recently interviewed someone who returned from the United States to seek their opinion. According to them, most people in the United States hope that our country will use hard currency, especially emphasizing the restoration of silver dollars. Furthermore, many silver mines in the United States have ceased operations, and the national treasury still has 190 million ounces of silver. Currently, among all countries in the world, only India is borrowing silver from the United States. Therefore, if our country were to borrow silver from the United States, it would be easier to succeed. This loan could be for a term of five years. If our country were to restore the silver standard, having one billion ounces of silver would be sufficient for the currency reform.

### National Army in Southern Shanxi Converges on Linfen – Continuously Recaptures Huo County, Zhaocheng, and Hongdong – Main Force in Western Hebei Pursues and Suppresses Communists, Battle Reaches Climax

The National Army entering Shanxi from the Henan route has made the communist army fearful. After the recapture of Jie County, the communist chiefs in the Yuncheng area, hearing the news, fled north and east.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] The pursuit and suppression battle by the main force in Western Hebei has reached its climax. The communist army seeks to strike at the weaknesses of the National Army.

### The Turmoil in the Islamic World

A delegation of 54 people from the Muslim pilgrimage, since their pilgrimage, has entered Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang, making some reports. Yesterday, they already took special planes sent by the government and flew back to Lanzhou, Dihua, and other places. The gentlemen of the pilgrimage went far to Mecca, a pilgrimage of thousands of miles, not only fulfilling a certain wish in their faith, from which they can be called "Hajji" (Hadi), and hoped by all; but also enough to enhance the understanding between our country and the various ethnic groups in the Islamic world, and strengthen the good relations between China and the various ethnic groups in the Islamic world.

At the time when this pilgrimage delegation is returning from Mecca to their hometown, we are concerned about the turmoil and unrest within the Islamic world, especially deeply. First of all, we want to declare that although there are a large number of followers of Islam within our borders, we are not an Islamic country; precisely because of this, our concern for the situation in the Islamic world does not have any subjective component or other selfish intentions. The current world situation is increasingly divided into two, and under this circumstance, the trend of the Islamic world is really related to the safety of the world. When we discussed the division of the world into two, we said that we are an eastern country, but do not recognize the east-west division of the world. If the world is really divided, the Islamic world is located in the middle of this division, the importance of the Islamic world's position in the current world situation is conceivable.

The Islamic world is really too turbulent now! The partition decision in Palestine not only prompted the conflict between the Arab people and the Jews in Palestine, but also aroused the emotions of the pan-Arab nation. All Arab countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc., have all risen up to support the Arab people of Palestine, and do not hesitate to fight with blood. Currently, there have been repeated armed conflicts between the Arab people and the Jews in Palestine, causing the entire territory to fall into the edge of war. When the British troops withdraw and abandon the mandate, a large-scale struggle will be inevitable. Outside of Palestine, due to the development of the Kashmir situation, India and Pakistan, the two newly established "Dominions," mutually accused each other at the UN Security Council. The Indian Union has criticized Pakistan within the Islamic world in many ways; however, the bloodshed in Kashmir has not stopped at all. This struggle not only hurts the feelings of India and Pakistan, two brotherly countries, but also is related to the overall situation of the world, and cannot be allowed to develop naturally. In addition, the turmoil in Indonesia is not only a problem related only to the Netherlands, but also a link in the turbulent situation within the Islamic world. But the most dramatic seems to be the news from North Africa. According to a report quoting the leader of the Moroccan Independence Party, he said: "If the United States allows France to continue to implement the current oppressive policy in North Africa, we will ask the other side for assistance. Yes, I mean the Soviet Union."

If we examine the reasons why the Islamic world is so turbulent after World War II, it is not difficult to find that one of the main reasons is that the United States, which led the world after this World War II, did not have a clear and firm policy towards the Islamic world. The United States has become a country that leads the world after the war, but what it lacks seems to be an entire world policy on how to lead this world. It may have a policy towards Europe and a policy towards the Far East, but it does not seem to have a whole policy towards the world so far. A policy towards Europe and a policy towards the Far East are only constituent parts of the entire world policy, and they must have their accurate estimates in an entire policy towards the world. Because of this, we have not seen the United States have a clear and firm policy towards the Islamic world until now. In a certain sense, the United States' policy towards the Islamic world can be said to be dependent on its policy towards Europe. It goes without saying in Morocco and North Africa, but the situation is somewhat the same in Palestine. That is to say, in its policy towards Palestine, the United States is somewhat following Britain. The partition plan was originally proposed by Britain, and the United States was making every effort to support it at the UN General Assembly. The Soviet Union originally had its plan for the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, so initially it appeared as a sympathizer of the Arab people, in order to win the favor of the Arab people, but it feared that Palestine would not be chaotic, and on the one hand, it supported the return of the Jews to their country, and finally it came out to support the partition in a posture of compromise with the United States. Its purpose is very obvious. It was unexpected that the United States would have such a decision that did not conform to the wishes of the Arab people under the manipulation of both Britain and the Soviet Union, which could not help but affect its position in the Islamic world. This is really a pity.

We do not seem to have forgotten that Mussolini once called himself the protector of Islam. Although the fascist regime has fallen and Mussolini is no longer alive, we cannot absolutely say that there is no one who wants to call himself the protector of Islam today. We should say that in another world, there are still a large number of worshipers of "Allah" in the Turkmen People's Republic, in the Uzbek People's Republic, and in other People's Republics in another world. If the world is really divided, a part of the Islamic world was already in another world. The talk of the leader of the Moroccan Independence Party, although inevitably contains threats, is also worth our deep consideration. We hope that the United States, which has the responsibility of leading the world, should not despise the problems within the Islamic world, and further make enlightened and wise decisions on the Islamic world, so that the turbulent situation currently appearing in the Islamic world can return to peace.

### Communist Brutal Torture in Northern Jiangsu – "Buying the Flesh of Refugees"

Where such permission is given, the Harbour Master shall notify the Chinese Maritime Customs [hereinafter referred to as "the Customs"] as soon as possible, and the Customs may, in any such case, have the freedom to verify the shipment of any goods liable to Customs duty on their entry into Chinese territory [hereinafter referred to as "Chinese Customs duty"], provided that the exporter has either paid the duty in Hong Kong or applied for an assessment of the duty in Hong Kong.

The Customs may freely designate places within the territory of Hong Kong for the collection of Chinese Customs duty or the assessment of the value of goods about to be transported to China. Whether Chinese Customs duty shall be paid or the value shall be assessed in advance at any of the above-mentioned places shall be at the option of the exporter of the goods in question, and the Customs shall inform the exporter concerned of this arrangement. The Customs shall issue a certificate of payment of duty to any merchant who pays Chinese Customs duty in Hong Kong and shall take measures within its organization to ensure that the goods concerned are given priority for clearance at the port of destination within China. The Customs may, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, freely establish inspection facilities in places chosen by it, as close as possible to the typhoon shelters and mooring areas referred to in paragraph 1 (B), and may freely inspect at these places and at other places agreed upon by both parties, goods whose exporters intend to pay Chinese Customs duty or have already applied for an assessment of duty in Hong Kong. For the sole purpose of verifying the shipment of goods on which Chinese Customs duty has been paid or assessed in Hong Kong, the Customs may freely station inspectors in the above-mentioned typhoon shelters and mooring areas. The number of these inspectors shall not exceed forty, unless the written permission of the Governor of Hong Kong is obtained, plus an appropriate number of servants, the number of which shall be agreed upon by the Governor of Hong Kong. In addition, in order to verify the loading of goods on which Chinese Customs duty has been paid or assessed in Hong Kong onto vessels of 200 tons net registered tonnage or more, the Customs may separately station an appropriate number of inspectors and servants, the number of which shall be agreed upon by the Governor of Hong Kong. Inspectors and servants may freely board any vessel for the above-mentioned purpose, but their duties shall be limited to verification and shall not interfere with or obstruct the loading of goods. Detailed inspection shall be carried out at the Customs inspection facility at the time of assessment. All Customs personnel performing inspection of goods must have an identification card with a photograph attached and certified by the local Customs Commissioner or his representative. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as authorizing any Customs officer or employee to enter any private place without the consent of the owner.

The Government shall instruct the Harbour Master to use his best endeavors to assist the Customs in refusing clearance to vessels sailing from Hong Kong to any port in China, except ports listed in the port schedule agreed upon by the Customs and the Harbour Master locally. This instruction is discretionary in nature and may be changed or revoked at any time in normal or specific circumstances. If it is sufficiently proven that a vessel that has cleared customs in Hong Kong and is sailing to a certain port in China has not sailed to that port without sufficient cause, then upon the vessel's return to Hong Kong, it shall be subject to penalties in accordance with normal procedures. Vessels with a registered net tonnage of less than 200 tons sailing from Hong Kong to Chinese ports shall, unless otherwise specified by the Customs, be notified to stop at one of the Customs stations near Hong Kong. Legislation necessary to implement this provision shall be introduced by the Government to the Hong Kong Legislative Council in due course.

The Government hereby authorizes the Customs to freely enter and patrol the areas within the territorial waters of Hong Kong described in the schedule attached to this Agreement [hereinafter referred to as "prohibited areas"], and to order any vessel in these areas to stop in order to examine its documents. If any vessel is found to be carrying goods without having completed customs clearance procedures in a Hong Kong port, the Customs shall hand the vessel over to the nearest convenient Hong Kong authority for custody, except for vessels that are permitted to continue their voyage. The Government shall introduce to the Hong Kong Legislative Council the legislation necessary to implement this provision, including measures to prohibit any cargo vessel that has not completed customs clearance procedures in a Hong Kong port from entering a prohibited area, but this provision shall not be construed as imposing any obligation on the Government to grant the Customs any right to search, seize, detain or penalize, or any right that the Government cannot cede or the Customs cannot enforce under international law.

The Government shall consider the needs of Hong Kong and the services of vessels in cargo transportation at the same time. Ships with a fourth class license owned according to the 1899 Merchant Shipping Law will, from time to time, be considered for prohibition of using them for the purpose of cargo shipment.

The Government shall consider what measures are feasible to prescribe that goods transported from Hong Kong to China via the northern border be limited to export through Shatoujiao, a location opposite Yuntang, the location where the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway crosses the border, the Luohu Railway Bridge, and other locations agreed upon by both parties, and to prevent or deter the export of goods at other locations on that border.

No provision of any clause shall apply to goods intended to be transported to China by air. No Customs officials shall be stationed at Kai Tak Airport, and the Customs officials currently stationed there shall be withdrawn.

The Customs and the Hong Kong Controller of Imports and Exports shall each provide to the other any information that it may acquire and that, in its opinion, would be helpful to the other in preventing and detecting smuggling of narcotics and taxable goods, or the export or import [as the case may be] of prohibited exports or imports.

The Customs' management of cargo transportation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway shall continue to be governed by the precedent and stipulated in an agreement separately made between the Government and the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of China. However, under the provisions of any such agreement, the payment of Customs duty in Hong Kong shall remain at the option of the merchants concerned. However, the Government may still provide lawful assistance to the Customs in accordance with any ordinances, regulations, or other laws currently in effect in Hong Kong relating to the railway or in a manner agreed upon by both parties.

During the term of this Agreement, the person stationed in Hong Kong at any time as the Chinese Customs Commissioner [as well as the Commissioners in charge of various departments in Hong Kong] shall be British and shall be a person acceptable to the Government.

As used in this Agreement, the term "vessel" shall include merchant ships, barges, and any type of vessel that may be used for the transportation of goods.

This Agreement shall enter into force on the date to be determined and notified by the Governor of Hong Kong, but this date shall be no later than January 20, 1948. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of one year from the date of its entry into force. This Agreement shall continue in effect after the expiry of one year from the date of its entry into force until three months after the date on which one of the contracting governments gives written notice of termination to the other government.

### Agency for Implementing European Recovery Program Should be Under Control of the State Department, Marshall Firmly States in the House of Representatives

[Our Dispatch] New York Radio, 12th: Washington Dispatch, Secretary of State Marshall testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, expressing the same views as when he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is, he has no preconceived notions about the agency for implementing the European Recovery Program, but he firmly maintains that a separate agency should be established, directly under the control of the State Department. Marshall believes that the European Recovery Program is "closely related" to American foreign policy and is the most important expression of American foreign relations.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] When Secretary of State Marshall presents his views on the European Recovery Program to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 12th, he is expected to be questioned about aid to China. Marshall's remarks may be more forceful than those he made before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. According to people familiar with the State Department, as the Congressional review of the European Recovery Program enters its second week, Marshall is increasingly optimistic that Congress will approve a plan with appropriate amounts and conditions. Marshall's current task is to prevent the Republicans from delaying the implementation of the aid program by involving other issues. The House Foreign Affairs Committee's questioning about aid to China and the economic situation in Latin America are part of these Republican tactics. In addition, the issue of dismantling German factories for war reparations is also expected to be raised by the House Foreign Affairs Committee to Marshall. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will listen to the views of the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas, on the European Recovery Program today.

[US News Agency, Washington, 11th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee concluded its three-day discussion of the European Recovery Program yesterday, while the House Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to begin reviewing the same issue on Monday. In view of the remarks made by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and political leaders from both parties, as well as the close attention paid by the members to the testimonies of Marshall and Ambassador Douglas to the United Kingdom, it can be seen that the review of the European Recovery Program will be extremely thorough and will continue for several weeks.

### Regarding the Management of the European Aid "Money Bag," the United States Seeks a Compromise Solution, the State Department Management Theory Has Been Strongly Opposed

[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to reports on the 11th, senior American administrative officials are currently "diligently and hopefully" seeking a way to satisfy both Congress and the State Department regarding the management of the Marshall European Recovery Program. The current dispute concerns whether Congress or the State Department should manage the "money bag," and whether to establish a corporation controlled by Congress or an administrator who obeys the State Department's orders to implement this massive program.

Secretary of State Marshall's efforts to urge acceptance of the State Department's plan have encountered serious opposition, and a compromise solution is now being sought, with the aim of breaking down this obstacle. So far, a satisfactory solution has not been obtained, but a highly placed administrative official informed United Press. Members of Congress are currently looking for solutions and are hopeful of finding a satisfactory answer, but continued: "This will be a long and arduous struggle." At the same time, Representative Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, has declared war on the Marshall Plan. Taber said: "The cost is too high." In a stirring statement, he called Truman's foreign aid spending plan a "blow" to the United States and the world. He strongly stated that Secretary of State Marshall desperately wanted Congress to rubber-stamp the plan, and that he found Marshall guilty of making surprising suggestions and unworthy of serving as Secretary of State.

### Aid to China, Japan, and Korea Should First be Presented to Congress, Republican Senator Folis' Opinion

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Republican Senator Folis told reporters that before discussing the Marshall Plan, bills for aid to China, South America, Germany, Japan, and Korea should first be presented to Congress. We should not hastily vote on a plan and then discover that we have no remaining resources to aid other countries. At the same time, according to State Department sources, the original plan in the Marshall Plan for the first year of aid to Britain, France, West Germany, and Greece has been reduced by two billion dollars. The amount of aid to Italy, Denmark, and Sweden has also been slightly reduced, while aid to the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Norway has been slightly increased. Thus, the total expenditure required for the first fifteen months of the Marshall Plan is $6.8 billion.

### Truman's New Budget Attacked by Republicans, Who Believe US Financial Resources Cannot Handle It

[Our Dispatch] New York Radio, 12th: Washington Dispatch, Republican members of Congress have launched criticisms against President Truman's proposed budget, deeming it "excessively wasteful" and "not within the financial capabilities of the nation this year." Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is leading this attack. He believes that although the President suggested last week that the burden on each taxpayer be reduced by $40, this is in fact impossible according to the budget proposal. While the President's proposed national defense expenditures and foreign aid expenditures cannot be said to be entirely inappropriate, they still meet actual needs, but he will also review them carefully, he said.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] President Truman will submit the 1949 fiscal budget to the Republican-controlled Congress on the 12th, which is expected to quickly become a major point of contention in the 1948 election campaign. This budget book is a document that is two inches thick, including a 57-page presidential message and 1,375 pages of explanations and figures.

### French Representatives Go to England to Discuss the Sixteen-Nation Conference; Plan to Establish a Permanent Organization

[United Press, London, 12th] Britain and France will begin discussions on the 13th regarding reconvening the Paris Economic Conference of the sixteen European nations under the Marshall Plan. Alphant, economic advisor to the French Foreign Ministry, and Marmelin, assistant to French chief economic planner Monnet, are expected to arrive from Paris today to participate in the consultations.

The subject of the consultations is the reopening of the sixteen-nation conference and its scope, as well as the establishment of a permanent information and consultation organization. All sixteen nations have requested the establishment of such an organization since the beginning of the Marshall Plan.

### U.S. Prices Rise; Higher Prices Expected This Year

[Associated Press, New York, 12th] U.S. prices in 1947 have already been labeled as too high, but many predict that they will be even higher in 1948. A consumer's dollar can only buy half the goods it could in 1935-39, but they have more dollars and spent heavily at the end of 1947, which is able to sustain current prices. Prices have been rising almost continuously for a year, reaching the peak after the First World War in 1920.

### British Trade Deficit; Exports Surge Last Month

[Reuters, London, 11th] Commerce Minister Wilson stated at a meeting here last night that preliminary statistics for December's British exports show the highest daily export value of any month since the war, the highest record in 25 years. December's export volume was about 20% higher than in 1938, and the export target for mid-1948 is 40% of 1938, only 20% away. However, the value of imports also increased greatly in December, so the trade deficit still reached £39 million.

### French Inflation Reaches Chronic Stage

[United Press, Paris, 12th] Minister of Labor Berfferyrin stated on the 12th that inflation has reached a chronic stage, and if it is not corrected, it will make France __________, the results of which are difficult to predict. He asked farmers to support the government's newly enacted tax policy on the wealthy, which stipulates a super tax on those with incomes above a certain level. He assured farmers that loans would be used to genuinely _________ agriculture.

### Italian Tax Collectors Strike in Support of Bank Employees

[United Press, Rome, 11th] The General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communists, has ordered 160,000 tax collectors to strike starting on the 12th in support of 60,000 bank employees who are on strike.

### Senate Committees Consider Suspending Funding for U.S. Occupation of Japan; Believe Government Has Not Provided Sufficient Information on Japan

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Senator Knowland, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told the Associated Press: From my personal point of view, unless the Army and State Departments provide sufficient information about the policy of dispersing Japanese industry, there will be no funds available for the Japanese occupation administration in the next fiscal year. Knowland believes that the authorities should fully disclose the entire policy of dissolving the concentration of the Japanese economy and provide a full explanation of the reparations policy. Only then can the two committees review the Japanese occupation funds requested by the two departments to be used starting on July 1. Knowland acknowledged that the State Department has provided some information, but there are two major issues that the two departments have not provided: one is a copy of the four bills recently passed by the Japanese Diet implementing the economic decentralization policy; the other is conclusive proof that our country has no obligations to other countries regarding the reparations issue.

### United Nations Commission on Korea Holds First Meeting Yesterday; Representatives from Ukraine and One Other Country Absent

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 12th] The United Nations Commission on Korea held its first meeting here at 5 p.m. today, at Deoksugung Palace, formerly the site of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission. Kim Kyu-sik and many international guests attended the meeting. Representatives from Ukraine and one other country were absent. The meeting was opened by interim Chairman Hu Shih-tse, who stated the reason for the meeting: "We have come for the independence of Korea. Today, representatives from various countries and fields are here to consult with the Korean people. I am very pleased." Then, Indian representative Menon was elected as chairman of the meeting. Previously, the Philippine representative argued that a chairman should not be elected until an order is received from the United Nations General Assembly allowing work to proceed unilaterally without Ukraine, but this was rejected. Representatives from China, France, Syria, and the Philippines then gave speeches.

My Representative's Speech

The gist of the Chinese representative's speech was: "After eight years of war and two years of peace, Korea has not yet achieved independence, which is a very unfortunate event. The current situation in China is quite unstable, especially in the Northeast. The instability in the Northeast also affects Korea. Korea was once an independent country, but after the Russo-Japanese War and the Sino-Japanese War, it became a colony of Japanese imperialism. Now, it is an opportunity for Korea to gain independence and freedom. China, as a neighbor, should be concerned about the independence and integrity of Korea. We sincerely hope that Korea can seek cooperation with all countries in the world and work together for world peace."

### MacArthur Hopes for Early Withdrawal of Troops Stationed in Korea

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] It is reported that General MacArthur is eager to withdraw all troops stationed in Korea as soon as possible. After the withdrawal of troops, the North and South zones can cooperate peacefully. MacArthur told this intention to Philippine representative Aranz of the Korean Commission.

### American Businessman Departs by Plane on Round-the-World Flight

The aircraft is set up as a flying showroom, with 16 armchairs, a sound film projector, and radio transmitting and receiving equipment. They are scheduled to return to the United States on April 14.

### U.S. Marines Not Ordered to Deploy to Holy Land

[Reuters, Philadelphia, 11th] U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General Cates stated today that he has not ordered any U.S. Marine Corps troops to Palestine. The thousand U.S. Marines being transferred to the Mediterranean region is a routine deployment, simply to supplement the Marine Corps strength currently stationed with the U.S. fleet in the Mediterranean.

### Bridge Over Jordan River Destroyed; Passage Between Syria and Palestine Cut Off; Arab Guerrilla Forces Intensifying Training

[Central News Agency, Jerusalem, 11th, United Press] Saboteurs tonight destroyed the "Daughters of Jacob" bridge over the Jordan River, cutting off the military passage between Palestine and Syria. When the explosion occurred, the Arab and Jewish forces on both banks of the Jordan River also engaged in a fierce battle. The British statement regarding the destruction of the bridge did not specify whether it was carried out by Jewish or Arab saboteurs. It is believed that the Jewish underground army is now attempting to cut off all possible routes for Arab troops coming from the Syrian-Lebanese border. Therefore, it is believed that the bridge was destroyed by the Jewish underground army.

[Reuters, Palestinian Arab Guerrilla Headquarters in the Mountains, 11th] An Arab leader told a reporter from this agency that the Palestinian Arab guerrillas have been receiving large-scale training at mountain bases near Samaria and Galilee. Within a month, they can be deployed as a disciplined military force. Countless Arab youths have left their homes to join the guerrillas. Many of the trainers are commissioned officers who have served in the British army. At the same time, it is rumored that thousands of Arab troops led by Kaukji, the hero in the hearts of the Arabs, are also preparing to invade Palestine from the Syrian border. This move will be a signal for a large-scale war to seize the ownership of Palestine. A reporter traveled 450 kilometers in the mountains of the Galilee region. In the so-called "Terror Triangle" of Nablus, Tulkarm, and Jenin, he saw countless Arabs carrying various long and short firearms and knives. They all said that they were waiting for the order to fight and were confident that they would surround and annihilate the Jewish army. Abdul Husseini, commander of the Arab forces in the Jerusalem area, came to Jenin to meet with guerrilla leaders. The center of Jenin was full of Arabs with bullets hanging all over their bodies. On the roads, Arabs carrying guns drove back and forth in jeeps. Obstacles were set up at all major intersections to strictly inspect passing vehicles. The Arabs seem to have plenty of weapons and ammunition.

### Former Romanian King Carol Concerned About Domestic Situation

[Reuters, Lisbon, 11th] Former Romanian King Carol said here today, "I believe that recent events in Romania have extremely serious implications for my country and the international situation. The replacement of the monarchy by the so-called Democratic People's Republic, which is actually a Soviet Republic, is a further step in the Communist movement in Europe and a serious threat to the civilized world. I am deeply saddened by my son's abdication. Judging from all indications, the act of abdication and its conditions were the result of coercion. In the darkest period of recent Romanian history, I was deeply worried about my son's fate. Now that I know my son is at least safe, I am very relieved. The incorporation of Romania into the Soviet system goes against the spirit of the Romanian people. Their future and freedom will henceforth depend on the victory of the civilized world."

[United Press, Luxembourg, 11th] According to reliable sources, Princess Anne of Denmark is expected to travel to Baissenay, Switzerland, by train on the evening of the 12th or the early morning of the 13th.

### American Officer in Berlin Area Shot by Soviet Troops

[Our Report] New York, 12th, Broadcast: Berlin News, Soviet military newspaper published Sunday that "Those who advocated German division have no place in the Berlin area."

### Katayama Cabinet Considering Dissolving Japanese Diet

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Kyodo News Agency said today that the Japanese Central Purge Committee will lift the purge order against former Agriculture Minister Hirano, "which has almost become a certainty." This makes the Katayama Cabinet feel uneasy about the motivation of the political situation, and the possibility of considering dissolving the Diet is increasing. It is reported that conservative elements will begin concrete work to form a new party this week. More defections of government party members are still not enough to put the opposition party in the position of the majority party. The proposed new conservative party will reduce the seats of the Socialist Party in the Diet. As a result, the government will face extreme difficulties in the Diet. Therefore, Tetsu Katayama advocates dissolving the Diet, hoping to make a desperate gamble in another general election.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] As a result of the recent development of the Hirano purge issue, the Socialist Party has now begun to attack Suehiro Nishio. It is expected that Nishio's power may be overthrown at this party congress, creating the Katayama-Asanuma line. If Prime Minister Katayama still does not know how to adapt to the situation and is unwilling to abandon the Katayama-Nishio line, then it is feared that a cabinet reshuffle will occur, realizing the opportunity for a Shioda prime minister.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The Liberal Party believes that the time for organizing a new conservative party has matured. In order to actively materialize it, a meeting of cadres was held on the 12th, and eleven members of the preparatory committee for the establishment of the new party were appointed. These committee members, together with some members of the Shidehara faction's club, which had defected from the Democratic Party, reported at that time the purpose of actively materializing the new party movement and requested assistance.

### Japanese Seismologist Predicts Major Earthquake in Japan

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th] Ken'ichiro Sasa, a seismology expert at Kyoto University, has repeatedly issued warnings that there will be a major earthquake in Japan, causing residents in various parts of the country to be unable to sleep or eat in peace. Today, he said again that a violent major earthquake could occur at any time, and his prediction is based on the recent warm weather, which may be a prelude to a major earthquake. Residents in the Kyoto and Osaka areas should prepare quickly. Previously, another seismologist, Dr. Shuichi Yamaguchi, had predicted that there would be a major earthquake in the Tokyo area, but he has now retracted this prediction.

### Philippines Plans to Borrow Money from the United States to Build Hydroelectric Power Plants

[Associated Press, Manila, 12th] President Roxas decided today to borrow 18 million US dollars from the American financial community to build four major hydroelectric power plants.

### United Nations Balkan Committee Publishes Investigative Report; Accuses Albania of Interfering in Greek Affairs

[Reuters, Athens, 11th] The United Nations Balkan Committee's December report was released today. It accuses Albania of interfering in Greek affairs and actively participating in the Greek guerrilla team activities. It also stated, "The committee is deeply concerned about the recent political situation in the areas involved in the United Nations General Assembly's resolutions."

Regarding Bulgaria, the report stated, "Although the peace treaty with Bulgaria has been signed, Greece's attempt to restore diplomatic relations with Bulgaria caused Bulgaria to request that Greece recall its liaison officer stationed in Bulgaria, expel a large number of Greeks from Bulgaria, and Premier Dimitrov of Bulgaria to make a declaration on the day the Bulgarian-Albanian friendship treaty was signed. Regarding Yugoslavia, the report pointed out directly that relations with Yugoslavia continued to deteriorate, as revealed by official documents at the end of 1947. The report finally mentioned the establishment of the "Provisional Democratic Greek Government" led by Greek guerrilla commander Markos on December 24, 1947, calling it the most shocking political development in recent times. It also stated that the United Nations Balkan Committee is closely monitoring the consequences caused by the cooperation between Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania and the Provisional Government. In addition, it is also paying close attention to any events that may lead to a special session of the General Assembly being convened on the recommendation of the United Nations Committee.

### Greece Asks U.S. to Unfreeze Gold to Curb Black Market and Stabilize Currency Value

[Reuters, Athens, 12th] It was revealed today that the Greek government has asked the U.S. aid to Greece mission to request the British government to unfreeze 1.3 million gold coins (equivalent to £2.5 million in British gold) that Greece previously pledged as collateral when it borrowed 10 million U.S. dollars from the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, so that the Greek bank can sell gold, curb the rise in the black market price of gold coins, and stabilize the value of the Greek drachma.

### American Engineers Brave the Heat to Work on Middle East Pipeline Project; Traversing Over a Thousand Miles of the Great Desert

[United States Information Service, Washington, 12th] A group of American engineers and others are now working hard in the rugged Middle Eastern wilderness where the temperature is as high as 130 degrees Fahrenheit, completing the survey work for the Arabian Oil Company's 1,040-mile pipeline. They are the pioneers who began to move the world's oil economy, because the world's use and need for oil is greater than before. For example, in the United States, the estimated production and consumption rate in 1947 exceeded 2 billion barrels, which is 800 million barrels more than the consumption in 1938 and exceeds the world's total consumption in that year. It is predicted that the consumption in the United States will reach 2.2 billion barrels by 1952. The oil cream stored in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, destined for the Lebanese coast, is scheduled to transport 300,000 barrels of oil per day for use in Europe. In addition, an agreement has been reached to move oil tankers on the U.S.-Europe route to the Europe-Middle East route. Oil production and exports to the U.S. from the Caribbean have ceased, and it is expected that from 1950 onwards, the Arabian pipeline will replace the Western Hemisphere's oil supply to Europe.

### German Division Difficult to Avoid; Soviets Plan to Force Britain and the U.S. to Withdraw from Berlin

[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] The starving and freezing German people are again deeply disturbed by the fact that Germany is facing the fate of unity or division. At this critical juncture, any action that could be regarded as provocative by one side is enough to cause the division of Germany and the withdrawal of representatives from the Allied Control Council. If so, then West Germany and East Germany will be formed. Most people in Berlin believe that division is inevitable. The Soviet Union has issued a warning in the Soviet newspapers in Berlin, stating that any action deemed by the Soviet Union to be in violation of the Four-Power Agreement will cause immediate consequences. These actions include the annexation of the British and American combined zones of the army district. At present, the further development of West German economic institutions into political institutions, or Britain's endorsement of the United States to stop allocating West German reparations to the Soviet Union, etc., if the Western powers decide to accomplish any one of the aforementioned actions, then the Soviet Union will immediately take countermeasures and announce its withdrawal from the Allied Control Council. If the division of Germany becomes a reality, the first to feel the consequences will be Berlin. Geographically, Berlin is in the heart of the Soviet zone. If the Soviet Union cuts off the supply of roads, railways, electricity, and water, it can make it impossible for the unwelcome British, American, and French to live in Berlin.

### U.S. Relief Rice Distribution Plan; Every Citizen Gets Five Sheng Per Month Per Catty; Registered Households Are Eligible for Rationing; Municipal Committee Decides to Complete Preparations Within the Month

[Our Report] The second meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies was held at 4 p.m. yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Wu Guozhen, Yen Hui-ching, Huo Baoshu, Shen Zonglian, Ye Shifu, Xi Yushu, Gu Minqiong, Zeng Shaochu, Chen Guangyuan, Liu Zongyue, Ren Xianqun, and Anferlai, representatives of the United China Relief, attended. The grain occupies 125,000 tons, the first ship has arrived in Shanghai, and the second ship is about to arrive. It was decided to distribute it to the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Among them, Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin have distribution scales, but Guangzhou is in preparation. The Sino-American Relief Agreement stipulates that American relief supplies are rationed to people other than the classified citizens who have been rationed. The so-called classified citizens refer to public and religious personnel, industrial workers, professional workers, etc. In Shanghai, all registered households are eligible for rationing. As a result of the discussion at the Administrative Yuan of Nanjing Committee for the Handling of American Relief Supplies, a four-month rationing plan was set, with each person receiving five sheng of rice per month, totaling two dou in four months. The purpose is to average the supply, hoping to stabilize the food industry. The distribution price is not intended to be too different from the market price, and may be adjusted once a month. The significance of the Sino-American Agreement lies in assisting China to establish a comprehensive rationing system. If assistance is successful, our government can control food and solve the food problem. The results of the discussion by the Yuan Committee are being exchanged with the American representatives.

Wu Kaixian Urges Preparation and Printing of Rice Purchase Certificates

Then Wu Kaixian said: In addition to the current rationed citizens in this city, there are 40 million people waiting to be rationed. Therefore, a special agency has been designated to plan first, and the printing of rice purchase certificates must also be started. Afterwards, Mayor Wu said: All those who register their households have the right to be rationed. He hopes that rice rationing can be averaged and carried out for a long time.

### China Trust Bureau Welcomes Investigation of Allegation of Selling Japanese Cloth

[Our Report] 2,500 civil servants in Nanjing jointly submitted a document to the Control Yuan to impeach the China Trust Bureau for "withholding Japanese cloth intended for rationing and using it for export to Australia." A reporter recently spoke to the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau to inquire about the matter.

### A Self-Proclaimed Retired Major Leads Wounded Soldiers in Rampage; Seven Shops and Houses on Pingliang Road Forcibly Demolished; Fan Zhongguang Detained and Sent to Garrison Headquarters for Interrogation

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning, at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Fenzhou Road in Yangshupu, a large group of veterans suddenly appeared, led by Fan Zhongguang, a retired soldier who claimed to be a major. They forcibly demolished seven shops and houses along the road, from 500 to 508 Pingliang Road and 92 to 102 Fenzhou Road. Upon receiving the news, the Yulin Police Precinct rushed to the scene and immediately arrested Fan. The 20th Wounded Soldiers Hospital on Meizhou Road demanded severe punishment for Fan for using ignorant wounded soldiers to bully civilians. The Yulin Precinct sent Fan to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m.

The corner of Pingliang Road and Fenzhou Road is the property of Sassoon & Co. During the War of Resistance, the property was poorly managed, and local poor people built shacks to live there in 1943. After the victory, the shack dwellers along the road rebuilt their shacks into tile-roofed houses in accordance with the police bureau's notice to improve the city's appearance. Later, a man named Liu Jizhang, residing at 390 Yangshupu Road, leased the land from Sassoon and ordered the shack dwellers to move, but the shack dwellers ignored him. The matter was litigated and, after six court hearings, the court advised mediation, which failed. Last summer, the court ruled for demolition but did not set a specific deadline. The shack dwellers appealed to the High Court within the statutory period, and the case has not yet been concluded.

Sudden Fire Suspected of Arson

According to Chen Zhengui, a representative of the shack dwellers, on New Year's Day this year, a Sichuan man named Fan Zhongguang came and said that he was ordered by Mayor Wu to move out within three days, or they would regret it. On the afternoon of the 4th, at 1:00 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out at Lu Guangde's house at No. 94, spreading to neighboring houses. Fortunately, nearby residents and firefighters arrived and worked hard to extinguish the fire. Four houses were burned, so arson is suspected.

Residents' Representatives Prepare to Petition

On the 5th, Fan came again to urge them to move. On the morning of the 9th, Fan led a large number of wounded soldiers to force the residents along the road to move their furniture and belongings to the open space across the road. By about 4:00 p.m., Fan, seeing that his plan had succeeded, happily left. After Fan and the others left, the shack dwellers moved their furniture back in and lived as before. That evening, Fan came again and, the next morning (the 10th), brought a large number of wounded soldiers, carrying ropes, hammers, axes, and other tools, forcibly demolished all seven houses, leaving more than 400 residents homeless. Yesterday, they sent representatives to appeal to all sectors for justice, demand punishment for the perpetrators, and compensation, and plan to go to the municipal government to petition today.

### Soviet Ship Sinks in the Deep Sea After Hitting a Reef; Crew Rescued and Returned to Vladivostok

### Train Fails to Stop at Station, Falsely Reports Bandit Hijacking

[Our Newspaper Report] The incident of the 56th train on the Beijing-Shanghai line failing to stop at Changshu at 1:30 a.m. the day before yesterday was rumored to be due to the driver being forced to hijack the train at gunpoint by two bandits. Yesterday, the railway bureau's spokesperson specifically corrected the statement, saying that according to the investigation results, when the train approached Changzhou, the Fangpeng of the Qishuyan Power Plant was damaged, and the Changzhou station was in complete darkness. The driver may have been negligent and failed to notice, so he fabricated the story to evade responsibility. Because no accident occurred on the train, why would the "bandits" insist on passing Changzhou station before getting off? The train driver, Song Shunlong, and the conductor, Shan Wenhan, have been detained by the police department, and the railway bureau has sent personnel to investigate the truth.

### Paper Storage Limited to Three Months' Worth; Price Evaluation Committee to Negotiate Prices at Any Time; Covert Purchases Considered Hoarding

[Our Newspaper Report] According to Item Ding of Article 2 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times, paper is also included in the items that should be cracked down on. The Municipal Government's Second Economic Conference had previously discussed this. Yesterday morning, the Second Social Police Bureau convened representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Qian Xingzhong, and representatives from the Paper Industry Association, Zhan Peilin, to discuss issues such as the amount of paper storage and the price negotiation system. It was agreed that the types of paper to be cracked down on for hoarding are newsprint and Mao paper (divided into domestic and machine-made). The storage standard for each store is one-fourth of the total sales volume for the entire year of 1947, which is equivalent to three months of sales volume. Those who exceed this amount will be considered hoarders. The import of newsprint with self-provided foreign exchange should be handled separately. Paper merchants should report to the Social Bureau and their respective associations and should sell it in the market. The paper industry association should organize a price evaluation committee to evaluate the selling price of paper at any time and report it to the Social Bureau for filing. Anyone who exceeds the negotiated price will be punished according to law. The above measures will be implemented after Director Wu approves them and submits them to the Municipal Government for approval.

The Social Bureau also stated that if there are agents who introduce and have no real owners, or who purchase and store in secret names, they will be considered hoarders once discovered. The regulations for the amount of paper stored by non-paper merchants and non-merchants will be discussed and determined by the Price Management Section of the Social Bureau together with relevant parties. In addition, whether the amount of paper stored by newspapers, magazines, and printing houses needs to be restricted or ordered to register has been submitted to the Municipal Government for instructions.

### Shanghai-Beijing Air Transport Drug Trafficking Case Solved After Tortuous Investigation; Ten Principals to Be Executed According to Law

The Songhu Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department recently cracked a major drug trafficking case involving air transport in Shanghai, seizing more than 90 catties of morphine. A total of 25 men and women, including principals and suspects, were arrested. It is reported that the ten principals will all be executed. The cracking of this case was complex. The Central News Agency reporter obtained the details from the responsible parties as follows: In November of last year, the Garrison Commander received a confidential report regarding drug trafficking, which briefly stated that someone was transporting drugs from the communist area in the north to Tianjin and Beijing, then transporting them to Shanghai and selling them to various ports. He immediately ordered the Investigation Department to investigate and solve the case. The Investigation Department sent personnel to Longhua Airport every day to pay special attention to the investigation of passengers. Secondly, when checking the passenger list, they found a Colonel-rank active-duty military officer named Li Jianfei, who took the airline plane between Beijing and Shanghai every one or two weeks, which aroused suspicion. Later, it was found that Li often stayed at the Nanjing Hotel in Shanghai and associated with many friends from Henan. It was discovered that some of his friends were drug dealers from Henan. The investigators used "cells" to try to get close to Li and learned that Li often carried a pistol in the sleeve of his right hand. At the same time, they learned that he was indeed responsible for transportation for the drug trafficking organization between Beijing and Shanghai. On December 9, they learned that his drug trafficking method was to transport the drugs in a specially made vest on his body. They waited at the airport on the afternoon of the 11th, and Li arrived from Beijing by plane and opened room 419 of the Andong Hostel on Beihubei Road.

Drug Traffickers Captured in Hostel

Personnel from the Seventh Investigation Brigade rushed to the hostel and saw that the room contained Hai Ziling (also known as Mai Changde), the person in charge of the Shanghai drug trafficking organization, as well as Mai Renfa, Dan Ze, Jia Jinbao, Kong Fanzhen, and others. They were arrested, and three small packets of morphine samples were found on Hai Ziyun's body. They then learned that Li had opened another room, No. 310, at the Yangzi Hotel, so they left some officers to guard the Andong Hostel and rushed to Yangzi. Li was not there again. Searching the room, they found a cloth vest used to transport and hide morphine behind the wardrobe, a Mauser pistol No. 2670 with live ammunition, and more than 40 bullets. The morphine, including the wrapping, was weighed on the spot, weighing 5 catties and 8 taels, and sealed.

Fake Colonel Enters the Cage

At about 10:00 p.m. that night, Wang Dechang, an investigator guarding the Andong Hostel, suddenly heard the phone ring and asked for Jia Changde to answer. Wang answered using a Henan accent. The other party believed it and said that his name was Li Jianfei and said that he was borrowing a phone elsewhere. Wang Dechang told him, "Boss Jia is eating, come if you want." Li Jianfei then entered the cage. After arriving at Andong, he was immediately arrested. Forged documents from the Second Hall of the Ministry of National Defense, with the rank of colonel, were found on his body, as many as ten.

Based on the obtained clues, drug dealers Bu Longfu (also known as Bu Xisan) were arrested at the Wu Palace Hotel, and Chen Jixi and two other drug dealers were arrested at No. 39 Xinmin Hotel. All eight principals in Shanghai were captured, and fifteen suspects were arrested in other places.

Confesses to the Inside Story of the Organization

In the interrogation room of the Seventh Brigade, Li Jianfei had no way to deny it and wrote a voluntary statement, confessing that he had bought morphine in Beijing for Hai Ziyun. After interrogating Hai Ziyun, he confessed the details of the Henan gang's drug trafficking organization in Shanghai: The organization was located at No. 14 Zhonghua Market, Zhonghua Road, Laoximen. The list of people in charge was: Manager Hai Ziyun, Deputy Manager Kong Fanzhen, Jia Jinbao. Economic Backer Chen Jixi, Drug Modification Engineer Dan Qing, Bu Longfu. Li Jianfei and Jia Renfa were the transporters between Shanghai and Beijing.

Hai Ziyun often opened a room at the Dafang Hotel in Shanghai, and resided at No. 33, 5th Alley, Jiaochang in Beijing. He also set up a Hongtai Gold Store at No. 21 Guanyin Temple in Beijing and had been trafficking drugs for eight years. He confessed that the names of the three major drug traffickers in Beijing who were connected to him were: Ma Xueyi (also known as Ma Erye), Jia Lizhi, and Li Benchu. The drugs were transported from the communist area by Ma Xueyi and others to Shanghai, then transported to Henan and other places. The amount was very large.

Drugs Found in Nanshi

In addition to air transport, the drugs were sometimes transported by train from Beijing to Tianjin, then transported from Tianjin to Shanghai by boat, with the drugs secretly packed in paint barrels. Two large boxes of morphine are currently hidden at No. 14 Zhonghua Market, Zhonghua Road, Laoximen, Nanshi.

According to the confession, the interrogators sent Shi Jian and others to Nanshi to retrieve the morphine. One was a wicker package and the other was a wooden box, containing both manufactured morphine and raw materials, weighing more than 80 catties in total, which were sealed by the personnel handling the case.

The Shanghai case was reported to Commander Xuan, who was extremely angry and handwritten an order to continue to pursue the relevant drug dealers in Beijing. Director Tao and Road Inspector Chen studied the matter and sent Shi Jian, attached to the Seventh Brigade, and Yan Jinwen, leader of the action team, to Beijing by plane on December 21 to work with the personnel of the Beijing Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department to start the work of solving the Beijing case.

Two Principals in Beijing Caught

Ma Xueyi, a drug trafficking tycoon in Beijing, heard that his Shanghai partners had "fallen," so he moved from No. 25 Lianzi Alley, Hepingmen, to the home of his mistress, Liu Fengming (a Beijing opera performer), at No. 13 Hongjing, Qianmen. According to a tip, Shi Yan and others captured Ma there on the 22nd. Jia Lizhi, another drug dealer, was arrested at No. 44 Xiangluying Toutiao. Li Benchu was unable to be located due to having no fixed residence. Shi Yan and others also seized incense at No. 27 Donghuamen Street for Li Jian. The case also involves a certain Jia, a Beijing Municipal Councilor. It is understood that Jia has great influence in Beijing and is currently being investigated by the Beijing Investigation Department.

After the Beijing case was completed, Shi Yan and others escorted the two arrested criminals back to Shanghai by plane on New Year's Day this year. The entire case of people and stolen goods was sent to the Investigation Department a few days ago and will be transferred to the military court for handling.

Zhang Yinmei then filed a complaint with the Civil Division of the District Court on August 29 of last year, requesting confirmation of the legality of the marriage between Li Baolin and herself.

### A Quick Look at Liuzhou

[Our Dispatch from Hengyang, 5th] The major artery of the Southwest—the Xiang-Gui Railway—grew during the War of Resistance and was also destroyed during the War of Resistance. Only two years after victory was it restored with great effort. Thanks to the arduous struggle of the railway's employees, even in the initial stages of rough pioneering, there was a vigorous and enterprising atmosphere. Liuzhou, also known as Maping, is located on

the lower reaches of the Liujiang River

at a strategic point. At this point, the Liujiang River's water volume gradually increases. Small steamers can reach Guiping and Wuzhou downstream, and sailboats can reach Chang'an upstream. In terms of land transportation, there is a road network extending in all directions, and the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway has its central point here. The city is densely packed with shops, commerce is developed, and it has become one of the four major cities in Guangxi Province. The urban area of Liuzhou is divided into two parts, north and south of the Liujiang River. The northern part is the old city area, quiet and lovely, where the Special Commissioner's Office and the County Government and other institutions are located. The southern part is the new city area, with wider roads and vehicles weaving like shuttles, giving it a distinct urban flavor. A pontoon bridge connects the two urban areas, making river crossing easy. Most of the large stores are still in the northern district, but the southern district seems more lively than the northern district, showing signs of overtaking it.

Liuzhou has not yet been designated as a city, but its municipal administration is much more advanced than that of Hengyang, which is designated as a city. We do not say that "law" and "system" are not important, but "people" are ultimately the driving force behind all undertakings. This statement is not an opposition to the establishment of systems, but a request that everyone not forget the human factor after establishing a system. If there is a good system but the right people are not in place, it is better to first emphasize "people" and then pay attention to the system. At the very least, the system and the people should be given equal importance. The Guangxi Provincial Government is planning to turn Liuzhou into

an industrial zone.

Liuzhou does indeed possess the conditions for this. In addition to the extremely convenient railways, highways, and waterways, Liuzhou also has the largest airport in the Southwest, which can accommodate hundreds of planes taking off and landing at the same time.

Mr. Liu Zongyuan was once demoted to this place, and the seeds of Liuzhou's culture were sown by him at that time. The Luo Chi Temple in the east of the northern city is built by the people of Liuzhou in his memory. It has now been converted into Liuhou Park and contains Liu Gong's burial mound of clothing and hats. The park area is not very large, but the ancient trees reach the sky, and the scenery is quite beautiful. In the bustling urban area, this quiet green oasis provides citizens with a place for recreation, which is an invaluable place for the cultivation of the body and mind and the adjustment of the spirit. Guilin's scenery is the best in the world, but

Liuzhou's scenery

is no less beautiful than Guilin's. The city is surrounded by strange rocky peaks that tower into the clouds. Goose Mountain, where the Xiang-Gui Railway Bureau is located, is one of these strange rocky mountains. Unfortunately, due to the limited time, I was only able to visit Liuhou Park. I was unable to visit the other scenic spots, which I deeply regret.

The prices here are higher than in Guilin but lower than in Hengyang, but imported goods are higher than in Hengyang. The women in the city have a bit of a Hong Kong style. Many of the local poor women are barefoot and wear short clothes. The heavy work of carrying and transporting is done by barefoot women in short clothes. There are fewer men engaged in this kind of hard labor. This place has already entered the South China region, so the climate is warmer, and compared to Hengyang, it is not a difference of one or two months, but a difference of one or two seasons.

Those who passed will be introduced to jobs by the training center. Those who failed will be retained for the second phase of training.

### Tiled Boat Sinks; Owner and Others Drown

[Our Dispatch from Jiangyin, 11th] The Qin Ji Brick and Tile Sales Office at 176 Maigen Road, Shanghai, hired six sailing boats from the Hubei gang of Mi Shaoxiang and others on December 20th of last year to transport 43,000 pieces of foreign tiles from Jiashan to Beijing. They arrived at Huangtian Port in Cheng County on the 5th of this month, reported for export, and were anchored in Bawu Port, Jingjiang, due to the heavy wind and waves. At 4:00 PM on the 10th, a Shanghai-bound commercial vessel coming downstream collided with the tiled boat, sinking it. The boat owner, Zhu Shaoqing, and the crew member, Wang Zhuanfang, drowned. The fellow boatmen requested the Wanghai Branch Customs to detain the infringing vessel to handle the negotiations.

### Hainan's Two Mines

[Our Dispatch from Hainan Island, 4th] Since its establishment at the beginning of the year, the Hainan Mining Bureau has been actively developing the rich mineral deposits in the two major mining areas of Tiandu and Shilu. The Tiandu and Shilu iron ore mines have been recognized as world-class high-quality mines and have long been famous overseas. After Hainan fell to the enemy, the Japanese invested 300 million yen to exploit the mineral resources of Shilu and desperately developed them. According to statistics, from 1941 to 1945, 620,000 tons of Shilu mineral deposits were mined, 400,000 tons were exported, and approximately 220,000 tons of ore remained in Basuo Port. 2.67 million tons of Tiandu mineral deposits were mined, 2.4 million tons were exported, and approximately 270,000 tons of ore remained in Yulin. From these figures, it can be seen how richly the Japanese have sucked the treasures of our Hainan. Fortunately, since the winter of 1944, the Allied forces launched a counter-offensive. On the Chinese battlefield, large numbers of Allied aircraft constantly bombed important locations on Hainan Island. The two iron ore mines ceased mining operations in January 1945, and the mineral deposits were fortunately preserved to some extent. Here is a report on the general situation of the two mining areas, obtained from relevant sources:

Tiandu Iron Mine

Located at Hongniling, Tiandu Village, about 12 kilometers northeast of Yulin Port, Hainan Island, at an altitude of 100 meters, it is a magnetite mine with a reserve of approximately 10 million tons. The highest content is 68%, and the average is 62%. During the Japanese exploitation period, all aspects were well-equipped, and mechanized mining methods were vigorously implemented. A single-track railway approximately 18 kilometers long was built from Tiandu to Anyeda, and automobiles were also available from the mine to Yulin. Ten 38-ton steam locomotives and 190 20-ton freight cars were provided, with a transport capacity of 4,000 tons per day. In addition, more than 30 various types of civilian ships were set up, and the Yulin Wharf was built to facilitate transportation out of the port. During the peak period of mining in this area, the Japanese recruited as many as 8,000 workers from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.

Shilu Iron Mine

Located northeast of Changjiang County on the west coast of Hainan Island, it is an effusive ore deposit with a quality resembling bean curd. It is crystalline hematite, with the lowest iron content being 62%, the highest being 66%, and the average being 64%. The content of impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, and copper is extremely low. The confirmed reserves are 450 million tons, and the undetermined reserves are approximately 30 million tons or more. When the Japanese occupied the mine, they conducted large-scale exploitation, with a planned output of 3 million tons. At that time, the mining method used was open-pit mining, which could accommodate more than 6,000 people. The main mechanical equipment for mining included pilot machines, rock drilling machines, generators, and various mining machines, not less than ten types, totaling more than 230 vehicles. The transportation equipment included six types of horizontal transport, lifting, train, and loading equipment with more than 560 units. At the same time, more than 900 houses were built, including offices, warehouses, entertainment grounds, repair shops, and dormitories. In terms of mine transportation, a single-track railway approximately 51 kilometers long was built from Shilu to Basuo. In addition, Basuo Port, wharves, and breakwaters were built to facilitate the entry and exit of goods and the transportation of ore. During the Japanese operation, from 1941 to 1945, more than 20,000 miners were recruited in batches from Hong Kong, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places.

The Current Assets Committee has decided to develop these two iron ore mines on a large scale. Since the takeover, the desolate scene of the mountains covered with weeds will disappear from now on. (Correspondent Chen Meiqing)

### Qiong Bandits Kill Li and Miao People; Two Thousand Children Forced to Form Red Guards

[Our Dispatch from Hainan Island] After the deployment for suppressing bandits on Hainan Island proceeded smoothly, the sea bandits, after being searched and suppressed by our troops in separate operations, occasionally fled to the Limiao areas belonging to Baihe and Baoting counties, attempting to establish a base in the mountainous area. In that area, all Li and Miao people over 30 years of age who participated in the bandit suppression work or resisted their orders were slaughtered. Those between 18 and 30 years of age were all forced to become bandits. Two thousand Li children between the ages of 16 and 18 were concentrated for training, euphemistically called the Red Guards, and sent out to scout military intelligence, or serve as guides, or act as vanguard troops to die. After receiving the report, the government has made appropriate plans.

### Nantong County Government Conference

[Our Dispatch from Nantong, 9th] The sixth county government conference of this county opened on the 8th. In addition to the district chiefs, the township heads of the first to eighth districts were also summoned to participate. This is a special feature of this conference. County Magistrate Shen said in his opening speech that the current tasks are to suppress the rebellion and bandits and implement the constitution and build the country, so the focus of grassroots work is on the two major issues of "self-defense" and "self-government". The meeting continued on the 9th. Zhou Taolu, the garrison commander of the Nantong area, attended the meeting and explained the current bandit suppression policy, stating that during the political bandit suppression period, the nature of the war has shifted from military-led to political-led, and military-supported. Therefore, to defeat the bandit army, it is first necessary to win the hearts of the people. He explained the pacification policy for this year in detail. The conference had detailed discussions on the elimination of opium, the expansion and merger of townships, and the first phase of conscription work for this year, and agreed on specific measures.

### Cheng County Delegates Meet Yesterday

[Our Dispatch from Jiangyin, 12th] The County Council convened on the 12th. County Magistrate Xu was transferred and went to the province, unable to attend the conference. Police Chief Wei was also dismissed for some reason. The new Chief Zhang Yunzhong has taken over. During the report on the administration work to the conference, officials expressed great dissatisfaction, claiming that the government did not implement the resolutions of the two previous conferences, and that the people's institution had become a mere formality. After discussion, this motion was temporarily reserved. The review committee will meet in the afternoon, and the conference will continue on the 13th.

### Xiqiao Police Station Indiscriminately Arrests Innocents; Bao Chief Petitions and Resigns En Masse

[Our Dispatch from Haining, 11th] The Xiqiao Township Police Station in this county arrested Yan Botang and Zhang , the deputy bao chiefs of the fifth bao of the town, on the morning of the 9th for no reason, causing public outrage among all the bao chiefs in the town. They jointly requested bail but were denied. Therefore, on the 10th, they collectively took a bus to the county to petition the county government and submitted their mass resignations, demanding the police station answer three points: Is the arrest of the bao chief without cause against the law? How will the police station's extortion of huge sums be investigated? Why was bail denied? The petition was received by Chief Secretary He of the county government, who repeatedly persuaded them to prioritize local affairs. He assured them that the freedom of the bao chiefs would be guaranteed, and promised to investigate the matter thoroughly. On the 11th, the arrested persons were released by order of the county government, and all the bao chiefs obeyed orders to withdraw their resignations and returned to Xiqiao from the county.

### Husband Detained for Years; How Can She Pay Bail? Ms. Qiu Huiying Attempts Suicide by Overdose

[Our Dispatch from Lanzhou, 7th] Ms. Qiu Huiying, 30 years old, a resident of 4 Yuanyuan Cang Street in this city, from Xingji, Jiangxi, suddenly attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills the night before last. The next morning, she was discovered by neighbors and sent to the Catholic Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, it was not too late, and she was revived. Last night, the reporter went to Ward 36 of the hospital to inquire about the truth of the suicide. The circumstances were tortuous, pitiful, and worthy of tears!

It turned out that Qiu's husband, Ouyang Bulun, when he was the county magistrate of Weiyuan County, Gansu, in 1946, was accused by local bullies to the provincial government for having his secretary, Ge Min, embezzle relief funds from the Tianlan Road project and loan them out. The provincial government immediately dismissed Ouyang and others for investigation and detained them in the detention center of the Security Command, not allowing them to contact the outside world. Ouyang's wife, Qiu Huiying, with her husband in custody, unable to swallow her food, went out to find food and clothing, and sent food to Ouyang twice a day. Over the years, all the clothes in the house had been pawned.

When Ouyang was first detained, many good people in Weiyuan spoke out in his support, and he was declared innocent. The civil part was sent to the Gaozhi District Court for trial, and he was also acquitted for insufficient crimes. Prosecutor Cai Xiaoxuan believed that this was unacceptable and filed a public prosecution. The High Court passed a judgment on the 3rd of this month, still finding him innocent. However, Prosecutor Cai still did not allow him to regain his freedom, saying that he would not be released until ten days later (the 13th of this month), and that it would be determined whether to file another public prosecution. He also said: If you want to be free, you must pay a bail of 50 million yuan. Qiu, having nothing to pawn and unable to borrow, feeling alone, had the thought of being tired of the world.

Ms. Qiu said in a miserable and tragic tone: "My husband has been in prison for more than a year, and there is only me, a woman, in the family. Currently, the family is destitute, and I can hardly manage two meals a day. Where can I get tens of millions of yuan to pay? I am an educated woman, and when I send food to the prison every day, I don't dare to tell my husband about my difficulties, lest he be even more upset. I have vomited blood several times after suffering more than a year of torment. The day before yesterday, I even tore off the only cotton quilt cover I had in the house and sold it. I thought that since my husband was innocent, he could rebuild the family and be a good person after being released from prison. Now everything has become a bubble. What is the point of me living? ..." She could not finish her words because of sobbing.

Ms. Qiu lay on the hospital bed, and in the dim light, her face looked even more haggard, undoubtedly the result of a year and a half of painful torment. According to the doctor, although she is out of danger, she still faints from time to time. She often whispers "Prosecutor Cai, spare me!..." A female reporter from a certain newspaper who went with her was also moved by her bitter account and shed tears silently. Before leaving, she donated her only 400,000 yuan to her. This matter has aroused widespread sympathy from the public.

### Tax Collection Offices in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Should Directly Collect Taxes to Promote Legal Income and Eliminate Illegal Apportionment

[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 12th] The provincial government believes that all taxes in the province should be directly collected by the tax collection offices, and that fixed quotas and commissioned collection have long been among the serious malpractices. According to reports, various county and city bureaus still collect business, slaughter, banquet, and entertainment taxes in the name of simplified tax collection, continuing bad habits, and apportioning quotas through chambers of commerce, trade associations, or restaurants and theaters, with open collection and secret commission. This turns legal income into illegal apportionment, and the provincial government has issued a special order to strictly prohibit this in all counties, and those who advance this practice will be severely punished.

### Municipal Specialist College Principals' Meeting Decides on Tuition Standard for Next Semester; Tentatively Calculated at Three to Four "Shi" of Rice

[Report from Our Newspaper] As this semester is about to end, the tuition fees for students at various private colleges next semester have garnered attention from all quarters. The principals of private specialist colleges and universities in this city, taking into account both reasonable treatment for faculty and the financial burden that student parents can bear, convened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Tsinghua Alumni Association to discuss the matter. President Ou Yuanhuai of Great China University served as chairman of the meeting. For half an hour before and after the meeting, the more than twenty representatives from various schools remained silent, indicating that this doubly "extremely difficult to resolve" contradictory issue further increased its severity, and that each harbored heavy distress. President Ou reported on the significance of the meeting, saying: "In our discussion today of the tuition fees for various schools next semester, we should first consider the reasonable treatment of faculty, as this is the largest and primary expenditure for each school. The government has already decided that the treatment of faculty in national institutions will be calculated according to the cost-of-living index from this month, and adjusted every three months. Private school tuition fees cannot be increased twice, and the difficulties of both faculty and students must be considered and addressed simultaneously. I hope for a detailed discussion to arrive at a reasonable solution." After President Ou's remarks, the principals looked at each other in silence. After half an hour, Shen Sizhuang of China Vocational School of Commerce and Industry finally spoke, explaining that current prices are rising like runaway horses, and faculty treatment is too low, making it impossible to teach with peace of mind. He also said that two-fifths of the students at his school will be forced to discontinue their studies next semester. Subsequently, principals and representatives from various schools spoke one after another, engaging in heated debate. Finally, it was decided that, given the current high price situation and to take into account the difficulties of student parents, the tuition and miscellaneous fees for each school next semester will be calculated based on the current market price of rice, tentatively set at three to four "shi." If special circumstances arise at that time, another meeting will be convened to make a decision. In addition, to discuss common issues of private colleges, in addition to continuing to participate in the Shanghai Specialist College and University Federation, it was decided to convene a joint conference of private specialist colleges and universities on a regular basis in the future, with each private school taking turns being responsible for convening it. The principals and representatives from various private schools who attended the meeting yesterday were Zhu Jingnong of Guanghua, Tu Yuxiang of St. John's, Ling Xianzhang of Shanghai University, Situ Bo of Dental College, Chu Fengyi of Shanghai Law College, Guo Xiaoxian of the College of Political Science and Law, Qian Sujun of Lixin, Zu Shi of Guanghua Business College, Shen Sizhuang of China Vocational School of Commerce and Industry, Hu Dunfu of Datong, Hu Wenyao of Aurora, Lü Yunming of Southeast Medical College, Jiang Weiqiao of Chengming Arts and Sciences College, Wang Mengfeng of Nantong College, Lu Xirong of New China College of Law and Commerce, Wang Zhenchang of Wuxi National College, Chen Gao of Xin Zhuan, Yan Jiuliang of Suzhou Art College, Liu Haisu of Shanghai Art College, Zhou Chengen of Soochow, and Chen Mengyu of East Asia Physical Education College, among more than twenty others.

### List of Scholarship Students: Urge Early Submission

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee recently sent a letter to various schools in the city, hoping that they would submit the list of students with both good moral character and academic performance to the committee before the 15th of this month to determine the quota of scholarship students for each school next semester, so that scholarships can be issued to students before the 10th of next month. In addition, the City Scholarship Unified Review Committee is scheduled to hold a standing meeting next Thursday to discuss fundraising for scholarships next semester.

[Another News Item] Private specialist colleges and universities in this city decided at a meeting yesterday to make the following two recommendations to the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee: It is hoped that the total amount of scholarships for the next semester will be increased to 15 billion yuan (compared to 5 billion yuan this semester). The course work for all schools this semester will end at the end of the month, and students with both good moral character and academic performance must be evaluated after the grades are calculated. It is hoped that the committee will reserve the scholarship quota for each school and send the list of scholarship recipients later.

### Shanghai University President Talks About Faculty Treatment Issues

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ling Xianzhang, president of the private Shanghai University, spoke to reporters yesterday about the issue of faculty treatment involved in student tuition fees for the next semester. He said that if faculty members cooperate with the school and increase their weekly teaching hours, their hourly pay at this school will increase, and their lives can be stabilized. They will not have to teach part-time at other schools, and the school can hire fewer faculty, so students can pay less tuition. This can solve both problems at once. He said: "American universities are still like wartime, and professors teach more than fourteen hours a week." Ling appealed at the end that this year is the beginning of constitutional governance, and private schools are also cultivating talents for the government. The government should provide as much economic assistance as possible.

### Trisecting Any Angle Is Not Difficult: Reader Writes to This Newspaper to State

[Report from Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 12th] A reader here today wrote to this newspaper, saying that trisecting any angle is not a difficult problem. However, his method is different from the principle of Yang Jiaru described in the Shanghai Central News Agency's telegraph on the 6th. According to him, twenty years ago, he heard Professor Jin Lingyi at Beiyang University say that there were many solutions to this difficult problem in a certain Japanese book. One is as follows, and it only requires a ruler, while Mr. Yang still needs a compass. The method is: on the "AB" side of angle "ABC", take any point D, make line "DG" perpendicular to "BC", and make line "DP" parallel to "BC". Use a ruler to pass through point B and move it within this angle to make line "BE", intersecting line "DG" at F and intersecting line "DP" at E, but "FE" must be twice the length of "BD", then "BE" trisects angle "ABC".

### Changchun University Dean of Academic Affairs Zhang Dexin's Opinion

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] Dr. Zhang Dexin, Dean of Academic Affairs of Changchun University, recently expressed his doubts about the "trisection of any angle," one of the world's seven major scientific mysteries, which was solved by Mr. Yang Jiaru of Shanghai, as published by the Central News Agency on the 6th. He believes that it is impossible to trisect an arbitrary angle using only a ruler and compass. Zhang studied mathematics and physics in Germany for many years and obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Berlin. He said: In mathematics, if you want to represent a number with the length of a straight line or use a number to represent the length of a straight line, you must first define the unit length. Then you can use a compass to draw a unit circle, and then you can easily construct any angle. Use a ruler and compass to construct a straight line length equivalent to the cosine of this angle. Conversely, if you have the cosine length of an angle, you can also construct this angle, as long as this angle does not exceed 180 degrees. He also said: An angle of 120 degrees is easy to construct with a ruler and compass, and its chord of negative one-half is also easy to construct. If an angle of 120 degrees can be trisected with a ruler and compass, then, of course, the cosine of 40 degrees should be able to be constructed with a ruler and compass, but this is not the case. Zhang said: I can use Y to represent the cosine of 40 degrees. From the trigonometric formula, it is not difficult to deduce that the cosine of 120 degrees is equal to four multiplied by the cube of Y minus three times Y, divided by two. Replace the cosine of 120 degrees with negative two-thirds in this equation, and you get negative one equal to eight multiplied by the cube of Y minus six times Y. If you use X to replace two Y, and then move the negative one to the other side, you get the cube of X minus three times X plus one not equal to zero. This is a three-degree cubic equation. According to a theorem of the equation theory, it can be known that this equation has at least one real number root. According to another theorem, we know that any root of this equation is not a rational number. Zhang finally affirmed that if a root of a cubic equation with rational numbers as coefficients is not a rational number, then the length of the straight line corresponding to this root cannot be constructed with a ruler and compass. Since X cannot be constructed, and X is equal to half of X, then Y cannot be constructed either. Y is the cosine of 40 degrees. Since the cosine of 40 degrees cannot be constructed, the angle of 40 degrees cannot be constructed either. Zhang continued to criticize Yang Jiaru's claim that any angle can be trisected. He said: Since an angle of 120 degrees can also be trisected, then, of course, angles of 60 degrees, 30 degrees, 15 degrees, 7.5 degrees, etc. cannot be constructed either. With these angles that cannot be constructed, it can certainly be said that an arbitrary angle cannot be trisected with a ruler and compass, but this arbitrary angle cannot be changed to "any angle," because angles of 180 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees, 22.5 degrees, etc. can be trisected with a ruler and compass. However, this cannot be said to be a "new invention."

### Tonight's Basketball League: Dagong and Qingbai Meet

In the third basketball league, there will be three men's A-division matches today, starting at 5:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium. In A2-division B, Jiashen will face V Team. In A1-division, there will be two matches: Shan Team will face the American Military Police, and Dagong will face Qingbai. Tickets are 10,000 yuan upstairs, 20,000 yuan downstairs, and 50,000 yuan with assigned seats in the stadium. Sales start at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The Siwei Boy Scouts will still be on site to maintain order. The program is recorded below:

Jiashen — V Team (A2 B) 5:30 PM

Shan Team — American Military Police (A1) 6:30 PM

Dagong — Qingbai (A1) 7:30 PM

Jiashen has been dispatched twice, successively defeating Yizhong and Peer. V Team suffered Jiashen's poisonous hand in the Chenyou Cup. Today, the road is narrow. A tough battle is predicted.

In the A1 division, Shan Team meets the American Military Police. Because Cai Yanxiong is playing for Qingbai, and Lin Weicong has returned to his hometown, the strength of the team has been greatly affected. However, the military appearance is still relatively complete. The American Military Police have lost two matches out of two, and their strength is mediocre. Shan Team should have no problem winning.

The match between Dagong and Qingbai is the highlight of today's program. Dagong has gathered famous generals, and their momentum is strong. Under the leadership of Cai Yanxiong, the old generals of the Qingbai team have not diminished in their power and will certainly pose a threat to Dagong.

[Dagong] Cai Lianke (Captain), Tu Wenlong (Vice Captain), Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Cai Zhongqiang, Huang Bogui, Zhan Chen, Zhang Gensheng, Wang Nanfei, Pan Jiong.

[Qingbai] Cai Yanxiong (Captain), Zhang Shaoqing, Tang Shikun, Zhou Dayun, Wang Junbing, Ku Yao Ya, Xu Heng, Zhuo Guorong, Wang Nanzhen, Chen Xianglong.

[Another News Item] Since the suspension of industrial and commercial loans, there has been strong demand from all parties. The authorities are still considering the matter. According to sources, the authorities are finding it difficult to make a decision. If dealt with too strictly, the lunar New Year may lead to the closure of some manufacturers. If dealt with too leniently, it will inevitably fuel speculation. They are currently studying the targets and will adopt a moderate approach, limiting lending to public utilities and those related to people's livelihood. However, the decision-making direction still awaits a decision by the Joint Treasury Council.

Local sugar, such as Shantou Green, opened at 1.7 million to 680,000 yuan, a decrease of 20,000 yuan. Shantou Red was 1.8 million to 850,000 yuan, and Shanghai Red was high at 1.95 million yuan, and secondary at 1.82 million yuan. The degree of increase reached 100,000 yuan.

### Competition Between China and Japan in Indian Textile Market Will Gradually Intensify

[United Press Tokyo, 12th] According to Indian cotton exporter Kotak, competition between China and Japan in the Indian textile market will gradually intensify.

He said that Indian merchants prefer to buy Chinese textiles, which can be directly exchanged for cotton. However, he also warned that India's cotton exports may decrease in the future.

### Tea Market Firm

Yesterday, the foreign merchants' tea market remained sluggish, but the process was more vigorous than last week due to the renewed adjustment of foreign exchange, and prices continued to increase. The base price was also quite stable. As for the various domestic sales teas absorbed by the main street and customers, the buying enthusiasm is still strong, and the holders are still hoarding them as scarce goods, and the supply is gradually declining, so sales continue to be out of sync, transactions are narrow and not smooth, and the situation continues to show vitality.

### On the Value of Science

— Hong Qian

When we talk about the value of science, we often associate it with its usefulness. It seems that whether science has "usefulness" in practical life is the standard for whether science has value. This is not just something we say off the cuff. Even the German scientist W. Ostwald mentioned this point in his "Outline of Natural Philosophy": "The value of scientific knowledge, whether in the past or present, lies in its general 'usefulness'. The pursuit of knowledge, scientific research, with itself as the goal, without regard to other practical effects. Such as so-called seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge, seeking truth for the sake of truth. Completely out of the fallacy of idealism, but in this way, the value of science has been reduced a lot."

Ostwald's view of the value of science naturally has its factual basis. The reason why we associate the value of science with its "usefulness" is not entirely without reason. Indeed, scientific knowledge, and even science itself, whether in origin or development, is closely related to human practical life. If we look at geometry, the word "geometry" itself contains the meaning of "land surveying"; the basic concepts and field observations of astronomy originated from the professional needs of prophets; chemical analysis began for the effect of "alchemy." Even many scientific theories that are biased towards theoretical research and do not focus on practical "usefulness" eventually make great indirect contributions to society and life. For example, Faraday's research never considered the problems of the electrical industry, but what is its impact on the modern electrical industry? Pasteur's research was also purely theoretical, but what is its result for the role of modern medical treatment? Who knew that the discovery of radium could treat cancer with its radiant energy? In addition, many inventions in the field of science and technology are all obviously born out of adapting to the requirements of practical life and out of the needs of the society at that time.

Although we value science from the perspective of "usefulness," it is not without reason and not without basis, but it does not have sufficient reason and sufficient basis. Because if we make a judgment on the value of science, we are in fact trying to point out its "cultural significance" in the contemporary social environment and in personal life; at the same time, the "cultural significance" it gains in a certain era is the standard and content of a certain value concept of science. Can we judge the value of human knowledge in primitive times from its "usefulness"? Because in that era, our view of knowledge can only be said to be purely for survival and for what is needed for survival. What is the "cultural significance" of knowledge in that era? At most, we can only call it a tool for "maintaining survival," right? We can also judge the human knowledge of early culture from its "usefulness": because the role of knowledge in that era is also inseparable from the scope of practical life. So its cultural significance, in addition to being a method for survival competition, has no other significance to speak of. But it is fundamentally impossible to judge scientific knowledge formed after several stages of cultural development solely from its "usefulness."

The reason why we believe that judging contemporary scientific knowledge or scientists solely from their "usefulness" is because the scientific knowledge theory and its cultural role that we see today are neither a tool for "maintaining survival" like in primitive times, nor a method for "survival competition" like in the early stages of culture, but have its new functions and new meanings in addition to practical "usefulness." Do great discoveries of our time, such as the theory of relativity and quantum theory, have direct "usefulness" for practical life? Is it a tool for maintaining survival? Is it a method for "survival competition"? Regarding these scientific theories representing the era, not only can we not judge their value from their "usefulness," but also their theories themselves and their impact on human spirit and thought cannot be understood and recognized by those who only talk about "usefulness."

From this point alone, we can already understand that today's so-called science has in fact long been separated from being a "method to achieve survival goals," and has long become an independent, autonomous activity with its own purpose. This is the new meaning and new role of modern science that we mentioned above. In fact, in the development of social culture, it is not only the evolutionary process of science that is like this, but also the development of other things, and even the entire human culture, is the same. For example, whether it is "seeing," "hearing," "speaking," or "acting," what was most obviously a tool for "maintaining survival" and a necessity in "survival competition" in the past has long been developed into an inevitable phenomenon in "cultural life." Because what we call "observation" with artistic significance is also a kind of "seeing"; what we call "listening" with appreciative significance is also a kind of "hearing"; what about "singing" and "dancing" with spiritual significance, aren't they a kind of "speaking" and a kind of "acting"? Examples like this are truly endless. However, we can already understand from this that the formation and development of any cultural society is nothing more than first separating from being a "method to achieve survival goals" and becoming an independent, autonomous activity or action with its own purpose.

Therefore, if we correctly understand the value of science, or in other words, understand the new cultural science of science, whether it is literature, poetry, music, art, or even "observation," "listening," "singing," and "dancing," can all increase our interest in life, enrich the meaning of life, satisfy the desires in our ideals, and enrich the realm in our experiences. Writers, poets, artists, and musicians each have their own realm, such as the so-called realm of literature, the realm of poetry, the realm of art, and the realm of music. Similarly, scientists also have their scientific realm. The reason why scientists tirelessly pursue knowledge and truth is to "seek knowledge for the sake of knowledge and truth for the sake of truth," just like writers, poets, artists, and musicians want to enrich and expand, and even create their realms of literature, realms of poetry, realms of art, and realms of music. Ostwald, as a scientist, does not know that science also has its independent realm, so he believes that "seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge and truth for the sake of truth" is a fallacy of idealism. I really don't know if this has reduced science's value as science by "a lot."

In summary, the value of scientific knowledge or science is not only in its "usefulness." Although the "usefulness" or "general usefulness" of science to human society can represent a part of the value of science, it cannot represent the entirety of the value of science. Just as applied science has made many contributions to contemporary civilization, it cannot represent the entirety of the value of science. The reason why the views of science value held by most people and Ostwald are not sufficient reasons or bases, and cannot become true concepts of scientific value, is because they are obscured by the status of knowledge in past social culture, and neglect its status in today's social culture; because they are obscured by the value of science in material life, and neglect its value in spiritual life and emotional life. The German philosopher Voihinger said it well in his "Philosophy of As If" regarding why science is science: "Scientific research has its own interest and pleasure. This interest and pleasure is included in science itself, and cannot be analyzed from its application. The world mostly regards science as a factory for the production of all practical applications, technologies, or tools. This erroneous view of science, I don't know if it is deliberately insulting science, or if it simply does not know science. Strictly speaking, science is a luxury item, but such a luxury item is necessary for noble human beings, and is also necessary in human civilized society. Naturally, such a luxury item with a noble meaning for human culture is not just science, but also philosophy, literature, poetry, music, art, and so on!"

### A New Interpretation of the Eight Items of the Great Learning

— Jun Yang

The "Great Learning" has what is called "Three Outlines" and "Eight Items." Someone has already written to explain the "Three Outlines," and now I would like to offer a new interpretation of the "Eight Items" for scholars to consider.

"To manifest illustrious virtue throughout the world" means that the ruler extends matters from himself to others. He deeply realizes the interconnected virtue of empathy, the so-called "benevolence," and has a deep understanding of the unity of self and others. Merely understanding virtue within oneself and not planning for others would make the matter seem incomplete and leave something lacking in oneself. Therefore, he must ensure that people throughout the world manifest their own virtues. However, the world is the union of states, so one must first govern the state; the state is the accumulation of families, so one must first regulate the family; the family is the gathering of individuals, so one must first cultivate oneself. Whether one cultivates oneself or not lies in one's actions and behavior; the master of oneself is the heart. However, the movements of the heart that manifest in actions and behavior are in fact distinguished and influenced by the heart. If the heart is not rectified, then one cannot cultivate oneself. Therefore, it is said, "Those who wish to cultivate themselves must first rectify their hearts." The thoughts that originate from the heart are called intentions. The heart is the totality of intentions; sincerity of intention means that one's thoughts are none other than the ultimate Dao principles of heaven and earth, without any falsehood or impurity within. "Those who wish to rectify their hearts must first make their intentions sincere." Intention is part of the heart, and the heart is the entirety of intention. There is no case where the part is insincere, and the whole can be knowing; and what is called rectifying the heart is precisely making the heart sincere. "Knowledge" is like understanding and reasoning, and it is why intentions are made sincere. "Attaining" is reaching the extreme; if knowledge does not reach the extreme, then its sincerity is incomplete, so it is said, "Those who wish to make their intentions sincere must first attain their knowledge." What is meant by "attaining knowledge through the investigation of things" is that "investigating" means reaching and exhaustively examining; "things" refers to all matters and objects. Principles reside in things, and if one wishes to understand and reason, one must seek it within things. If knowledge does not reach things, then what is known is empty and without foundation. If things are not exhaustively examined to the point of discerning their principles, then what is understood is partial and incomplete. All investigating things, attaining knowledge, making intentions sincere, rectifying the heart, and cultivating oneself are matters of manifesting one's virtue and renewing oneself. As for regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under heaven, these are efforts to enable others to manifest their virtue and are the work of renewing the people. Investigating things and attaining knowledge are used to clarify the ultimate good, which is knowing; making intentions sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under heaven are used to reach the ultimate good, which is action.

"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must regard self-cultivation as the root" means that self-cultivation is in fact about investigating things, attaining knowledge, making intentions sincere, and rectifying the heart. When these five matters are complete, one will not fail to be a virtuous person. One can retreat and establish oneself, and advance and establish others. Establishing oneself is for the people, and establishing others is for the ruler. Those who serve the people can advance and become rulers, and those who are rulers can retreat and serve the people. Is this not the true meaning of democratic politics? Therefore, it is said that the political ideal of Confucianism, the so-called kingly way, while outwardly having a ruler, is in essence democratic. "When the root is disordered and the branches are well-governed..." The "root" refers to oneself, and the "branches" refer to others. Our Confucianism takes ethics as the root of politics. The key to governance lies in nurturing good talents, sending them out to extend what they have cultivated in themselves to govern others. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "Governing depends on people," which is the same meaning. If one does not educate and nurture the people, causing them to each fulfill the matter of self-cultivation, and merely uses laws and punishments to guide and regulate them, then those who wield power in the future will all be today's unrestrained and shameless people. What is expected of their governance will also be no more than unrestrained and shameless governance. Gradually, this will inevitably lead to chaos. This is for no other reason than that the root is disordered, and it is impossible to want the branches to be well-governed. "What is esteemed is meager, while what is meager is esteemed" means that "what is esteemed" refers to the family, and "what is meager" refers to the state and the world. Governing lies in practicing benevolence, and the method of practicing benevolence is simply extending love. What people love most is their family. The way of governing lies in enabling people throughout the world to extend what they love in their families to love the state and to love the world. If one is meager towards one's family, then the source of love is blocked, and how can one extend it to the state and the world? Our Confucian emphasis on the root is because we deeply understand human nature, and we can take advantage of it and guide it. What is human nature? It is simply that each person loves his or her family. What is this advantage and guidance? It is clarifying that all people are born together between heaven and earth, that human nature and my nature both originate from heavenly principles, that self and others originally belong to one body, and that extending one's love for family to love for the state and the world is merely a matter of doing it or not doing it, willing it or not willing it. Conversely, if a person cannot love his or her family and seeks to love the state and the world, then this is acting against nature. Therefore, it is said, "There has never been such a thing."

### From Concrete to Abstract

— Yan Qun

The two terms "concrete" and "abstract" were introduced from the West. "Concrete," the original English word is Concrete; "abstract," the original English word is Abstract. Concrete originates from the Latin word Concretus, Concretus is the past participle of the verb Concrescere, meaning to solidify or coalesce. Abstract originates from the Latin word Abstractus, Abstractus is the past participle of the verb Abstrahere, meaning to extract or draw away. By extension, anything that coalesces into a body, with a form that can be perceived by the senses, is called concrete; anything that extracts form, cannot be perceived by the senses, but is only thought of by the mental faculty, is called abstract.

For example, a thing that can be seen and touched is called concrete. A concept existing in the mind, such as "white" or "square," which cannot be seen or touched, but can only be thought of, is called abstract. The concept of "white," the concept of "square," is extracted from a thing at a certain time and place. A thing at a certain time and place is limited by the time and space of that time and place; it is specific. What is extracted from it, such as the concepts of "white" and "square," is not limited by time and space; it is universal. The specific must be singular, like this table, there is only this one. The universal, however, is countless; like tables, all tables are included, and any table at any time and place is called a table. Another example is the falling of a person from a building, or the flowing of water downwards; these are specific, individual instances. As for the force of gravity, which can encompass all falling instances, this is a universal principle. Therefore, we say: things and events are concrete, and also specific; reason and principle are abstract, and also universal; the perception of a thing or event by the senses is concrete, and also specific; the concept of the reason and principle of things in thought is abstract, and also universal. In China, we have the saying, "That which is above form is called the Dao, that which is below form is called the instrument" (from the Great Treatise of the Book of Changes, section 12). "Above form" is abstract, "below form" is concrete, "Dao" is reason and principle, "instrument" is things and events.

The ability to abstract is inherent to humans, and also unique to humans. The key to human culture lies in this. The more advanced the culture, the higher the ability to abstract. The ability to abstract first appears in language. Language can be considered humanity's earliest cultural creation. The basic elements of language are verbs and nouns. Verbs and nouns are abstract symbols created by humans to represent concrete things, and the movement and state of things (Action and state). Nouns and verbs combine to form sentences, and sentences are used to record experience, and transmit experience. (So-called experience is the experience of humans with things and their dynamics.) Experience can be accumulated through recording, and exchanged through transmission. The accumulation, progress, and dissemination of culture all rely on the function of language (including writing).

Humans can only have learning with language. Learning is the experience one gains oneself, asking is obtaining the experience of others. One's own experience cannot be accumulated without language, and the experience of others cannot be acquired without language; therefore, it is said that there is learning only after language.

The work of learning lies in seeking universal and abstract principles and examples. These principles and examples are obtained from the specific and concrete things and their dynamics that humans have experienced. The purpose is, on the one hand, to satisfy the desire for knowledge, and on the other hand, to adapt to practical needs. Things and their dynamics are scattered, complex, and changing. With a finite life, limited intellect, and short memory, one cannot experience everything one by one, and so one must resort to convenience: that is, seeking totality in the scattered, simplicity in the complex, and constancy in the changing. The results sought and obtained are reason and principle. Furthermore, the arrangement of the universe is not only that there is totality in the scattered, simplicity in the complex, and constancy in the changing, but also that totality can encompass the scattered, simplicity can govern the complex, and constancy can balance the changing. Thus, the reason and principle that humans seek not only satisfy the desire for knowledge, but can also be "utilized" to achieve the effect of "enriching life." Therefore, learning has two aspects, knowledge and action. The learning of the knowledge aspect is like modern pure science (Pure science), the learning of the action aspect is like modern applied science (Applied science). Pure science explores the universal and abstract principles and examples in specific and concrete things, and applied science studies how to implement these principles and examples in various things and objects, and obtain practical benefits.

In conclusion, the development of human intellect and the progress of culture proceed from the concrete to the abstract. It begins with the specific things perceived by the senses, and reaches the universal principles and examples thought of by the mind. The more things perceived, the more accurate and certain the principles and examples obtained, and the deeper and broader the knowledge and understanding. Conversely, the more precise the principles and examples obtained, the more things perceived, and the greater the efficacy of controlling the environment. The entire evolution of culture is always proceeding back and forth on the path of concrete to abstract, and abstract to concrete.

### Anecdotes from Academic Circles

— Zhang Qiyun

Essentials of Military Building

Modern military strength is actually the manifestation of overall national strength. Military building and nation-building are inherently consistent. Without a grand and far-reaching scale of nation-building, the ultimate goal of military building cannot be achieved. If military building is not in line with the ideals of nation-building, it will not only deplete the national treasury, but also make things more chaotic. Nation-building requires four forces, namely, human resources, material resources, academic resources, and finally, the power of universal virtue, which can be called the four cornerstones. The essentials of military building should also be none other than these.

U.S. General Marshall believed that too many standing troops are not suitable for modern democratic countries. He advocated military training for young people to provide the country with an unlimited source of troops to supplement the inadequacy of standing troops. China should prepare for this matter at its own pace and seek practical results. Military training should not only refer to basic training in modern weapons; academic subjects should be given equal emphasis as practical subjects. The Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Education should make thorough designs and not be perfunctory in their implementation. Universal training is certainly the fundamental plan for military building. For the time being, even addressing the immediate problem, that is, the education of the current millions of soldiers, is already a uniquely great adult education program in Chinese history. It includes three aspects: First, basic education should be implemented to eliminate illiteracy. Second, they should understand the history and geography of their own country and the international situation to cultivate civic knowledge. Third, they should be taught practical knowledge such as house building, ditch digging, gardening, and crafts to cultivate employment skills after retirement. Military education should be coordinated with military life and should be rich in variety to increase interest. Noble forms of entertainment such as music and art should also not be neglected. In the future, the problem of teachers will inevitably be a major difficulty. The principles of moving schools to troops or moving troops to schools can be experimented with. How should time be allocated? Can one day be set aside each week as an education day? All of these should refer to the effective methods already tested by other countries for reference. What we have described above should not be regarded as too lofty. This is the starting point for raising the standard of living for the people.

The issue of material resources, all development of national resources is related to national defense. The way to strengthen the army should be embodied in enriching the country. A vast military expenditure cannot be borne by the national treasury, so private enterprises should be able to be quickly converted to military use, and military uses should also be able to be quickly converted to civilian use. Only with armament can one resist war. During the war, the United States was called the arsenal of democratic countries, producing more than 10,000 aircraft annually. The aluminum required for its aircraft, utilizing the power of the Tennessee River for manufacturing, accounted for 60 percent. The nitric acid, the raw material for bomber bombs, was also mostly obtained from it. The T.V.A. system was originally a form of local economic construction, beneficial to people's livelihood in peacetime and helpful to national defense in wartime. The cause of enrichment and strength comes from the same source. Modern warfare is scientific warfare, and scientific progress and achievements have changed the entire strategy accordingly. The fate of the country can be said to depend on scientific research. Science is the seed, invention is the fruit. Material resources are only a potential. With academic resources, they can be transformed into real strength. The Marshall Research Institute is far more important than the arsenal. The arsenal may be full of weapons and military equipment, but they will soon become old and unusable. Churchill once called the future empire the "Empires of Mind." Those who are less intellectually capable cannot be said to be strong even if they are thousands of feet high, and cannot be said to be solid even if they are in the midst of ten thousand miles of waves. However, ordinary people often think that science relies solely on reason, but in fact, the true scientific spirit always contains noble morality. Take radar (or radiolocation) as an example. Radar is an instrument for measuring position and distance by radio methods and can be translated as a "surveillance instrument." This type of instrument can be used to detect the traces of enemy aircraft and submarines and repel them, and can also be used to accurately bomb through clouds and fog. It is not only the most effective new weapon for the army, navy, and air force in wartime, but also makes a great contribution to the safety of sea and air transport after the war. The invention of radar is really the result of the combination of spirit and technology. Although the basis is the scientists' diligent research in peacetime, if they were not brave and united during wartime, it would not be able to meet the urgent needs of wartime, this is the first. The government has a generous and enlightened policy on academic research, and scholars are also sincerely patriotic and keep secrets. The government and universities have a full spirit of cooperation, this is the second. The Englishman Robert Watson-Watt once said that the close cooperation between military experts, industrialists, and scientists is the real secret weapon of the United Kingdom. (See his article "The Relationship between Radar and War and Peace", published in the British weekly magazine Nature, September 15, 1945) Also, if a new invention is to be applied to combat, it must rely on the cultivation of new talents. The training and organization of talents cannot be led without morality, this is the third. Although major strategies are designed by the military, those in charge of national military affairs should be politicians rather than military personnel. In national defense and diplomacy, there must be a spirit of national unity. The decision-making of national defense plans and diplomatic policies must go beyond political party interests. Without virtuous men, how can a country be established? This is the fourth. All of the above are precious lessons and experiences from World War II. Without deeply understanding the lessons of history, rising up and striving for it, there is no way to build an army or a country.

### Marriage Matters

— Yuan Liang

The marriage between the son of the provincial chairman and the niece of the provincial government secretary-general can be considered a perfect match. Look at the news published in the Central Daily News on the sixth, about the marriage of the eldest son of Liu Wenhui, the chairman of Xikang Province, and the niece of Deng Hanxiang, the secretary-general of the Sichuan Provincial Government. Not only is their status enviable, but the degree of extravagance is truly worthy of envy by people all over the world! Let's take a look at the programs such as giving gifts:

"All the gifts filled two hundred boxes. From Liu's mansion on Xinyu Sha Street, North Gate, the line stretched for two or three miles. Citizens watching along the way rubbed shoulders, and there was a sea of people. Among the gifts, the pillows alone numbered four hundred pairs, worth about 150 million yuan. The porcelain was worth 1 billion yuan, including four palace lanterns, made of 48 taels of gold, inlaid with jewels. Liu's son-in-law, Wu Peiying, presented a picture of a gold money curtain inlaid with eight treasures, dazzling and invaluable. It is estimated that 160 tables of banquets have been booked, with a deposit of more than 30 million yuan, and more than 100 tables of evening snacks have been prepared. The cost of each table of snacks is worth 160,000 yuan. In addition, a large number of noble handkerchiefs are prepared for distribution to relatives and friends (omitted below)."

Marriage is a lifelong event, and of course it cannot be taken lightly, but is such extravagance too much? The author does not understand the customs of Sichuan and Xikang. Do pillows need to be changed every day?

I ask, what are all these things for in one marriage? Besides "showing off wealth," what else is the meaning? Speaking of this young master Liu Yuanyan, although he is already twenty-eight years old, he is still studying in the Department of Sociology at West China University. The bride, Hu Wenqu, is also studying together. Neither of them are producing people. Of course, these gifts were prepared by their parents. The government orders and reiterates to the people to practice thrift. The chairman of the province and the secretary-general are the highest examples for the people of the province. Not only do they not lead in thrift, but they intensify it to this extent! There are hundreds of millions of starving refugees in the country crying for food, and university students in Beijing and Shanghai are running and shouting in the cold wind to raise cold clothes. The new people studying in the Department of Sociology probably don't know this, right?

A month ago, Princess Elizabeth of England's wedding, because it was a time of crisis, was simplified despite being the crown prince. Unexpectedly, the son of the chairman of a Chinese province got married with such power. How could it not attract international attention!

China, a land full of sores, has endless strange things. I hope the newspaper is spreading rumors and joking, but judging from how vivid it is written in the newspaper, it doesn't seem like a fabrication. The wedding date was December 27th, it has been ten days, and there has been no movement from the government. If the censors don't even care about this kind of outrageous thing, what are they talking about democracy?

### Sound Almighty

— Tian Shi

If "sound" is above the range of hearing, it becomes an important tool with great capabilities in science, industry, and medicine. Using "sound" to work is no longer a rare thing.

Everyone knows that the occurrence of "sound" is due to a kind of mechanical vibration. The number of vibrations (ie, frequency) suitable for ordinary human eardrums is about 20 to 110 vibrations per second. Beyond this, it is sharp, noisy, and unbearable. The new sound transmitter can emit high-frequency sound waves of 1,200,000 vibrations per second, and these sound waves have many bizarre uses.

Many factories in the United States have now universally used "sound" to check for internal cracks in huge metal castings. Professor Faston of the University of Michigan discovered that if there are no cracks inside the metal casting, the sound waves can be detected and amplified by echoes after passing through. If there are cracks, the echoes at the cracks are produced faster and can be photographed on the screen to identify their location. Therefore, for important components such as propeller shafts and motor vehicle axles, this method of inspection can indeed be much more convenient.

Many dairy farms use sound waves to homogenize milk and sterilize it. The method is to allow the milk to flow through a steel sheet that is emitting high-frequency sound waves. Most of the bacteria are killed by the sound waves, and the larger fat particles are broken into powder, making it suitable for digestion by the stomach and intestines. Medical authorities generally believe that this kind of milk is especially suitable for infants.

Scientists have placed great hope on the sterilizing effect of sound waves on food. After many laboratory tests, the sterilizing effect of sound waves on food has indeed achieved considerable success.

There is also a type of "automatic door" produced in Kansas, USA, which is also installed using the power of sound. When entering the door, just flip a button to generate a very high-frequency sound wave, which pushes the mechanism to pull the door open, and at the same time turns on the light.

As for using sound to drive away fog, it has also been successfully tested, which can reduce many difficulties and dangers for aviation and navigation. The method is to emit sound waves towards the fog, and within a few seconds, the mist turns into drizzle and disappears.

It is reported that Soviet scientists use sound waves to help the growth of agricultural crops. According to the report, after testing, the yield of some crops has increased. Sweet potatoes germinate one week earlier, and the yield increases by about 40% to 50%. Peas also germinate earlier, and the yield even doubles. If this news is not false, then the future contributor to solving the world food shortage will be "sound."

There are also those who use sound waves to help wash clothes, because high-frequency sound waves pass through the clothes, bringing out all the attached dust and promoting the mixing of oil and soap. A businessman from Chicago has recently applied for a patent to manufacture a "vacuum sound wave washing machine."

At a carbon black factory in Texas, a special sound wave transmitter is installed inside the chimney, so that the tiny carbon particles escaping from the chimney collide with each other and fall down again. This can reduce a lot of waste. In chemical plants and mines, many people have installed this type of sound wave transmitter to reduce losses and avoid danger.

Since sound waves have such amazing power, if used for destruction, its horror will not be less than that of atomic bombs. Military scientists are now actively developing it into a killing weapon for use in future wars. As far as is known now, if a large number of sound waves are concentrated and emitted, it can kill people within 60 meters in 3 to 4 to 10 seconds, and even at 300 meters, it can cause serious injuries.

In short, "how to use sound waves" is a new topic in the scientific community. The current achievements are limited, and research work is still in its infancy. The future development still requires continued efforts from scientists around the world, as to whether it is a blessing or a curse for world civilization, it depends on the fate of mankind.

### Wu Peifu and Xu Shichang

— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion

Japan manufactures various puppets to divide China, and needs to select many targets. Wang Kemin, the king of North China, is not qualified enough, only a skilled economist for temporary use. The real targets are two people, one is Wu Peifu, and the other is Xu Shichang, who both died one after another in the twenty-eighth year, victims of enemy oppression.

Wu Peifu has the qualifications of an idol in the minds of the northern military and political circles and the common people. He vowed not to enter the concession and lived in the Shijin Garden of Dongsi Pailou, Beijing. The headquarters of the Japanese army was located in Shizi Hutong to the north, just under the closely neighboring "low eaves". The Japanese chiefs paid attention to him at all times. A year before the incident, Wu sent a telegram to the Japanese Emperor in his personal capacity, dissuading him from aggression. Although it was of no use in fact, the Japanese Emperor (ie, Hirohito) had a deep impression of Wu's name. Therefore, he repeatedly inquired about the situation in North China. Why no Wu Peifu? At that time, the pseudo "Provisional Government" had been established for a year and a half. If it was to change from "Provisional" to "Formal," Wang Kemin and others did not have this qualification. Therefore, if old Wu agreed, the "North China Country" would be realized, and the "Wang Family Store" would inevitably withdraw and give way to Wu, just like Liang Hongzhi in Jiangnan. Although he was the head of the so-called "Renovation Government", once Wang Jingwei came out, Liang could only demote himself to a hospital director. It's all a matter of qualification.

Wu himself raised the banner against Duan Dang in the Gengshen Year of the Republic of China 9, condemning Duan as pro-Japanese and a traitor. By the September 18th Incident, he repeatedly sternly criticized Zhang Xueliang for "holding hundreds of thousands of soldiers and abandoning three provinces." To expect him to personally engage in "great treason" once and for all is naturally something that cannot be expected of human nature. Although old Duan was pro-Japanese in the past, after the "September 18th" incident, he was still able to avoid going to Shanghai from the Japanese Concession. When the Japanese requested him to come out, he directly told them that they must first return the three provinces! Although little Zhang lost the three provinces, he would not surrender to the enemy after all. Moreover, although old Wu was an old warlord, he also had his own rebellious nature. Under the enemy's encirclement, when talking about a new organization, he also insisted that the enemy troops completely withdraw from the country as the first condition. The Japanese took his words out of context, erased the words "condition", and really thought he agreed to a new organization, "deceiving themselves", intending to put him on stage and hold a conference to invite Wu to announce the "peace" policy. When the time came, Wu was indeed crowded out, and he taught Japan in public, talking endlessly. Those around him saw that the situation was not right, and hurriedly ordered the photographers who had been ambushing to quickly capture the whole scene. On the one hand, they took Wu backwards from the state of "his speech was not finished", and on the other hand, they told all the reporters not to record Wu's words. Later, the photos were washed out and published with a speech written by others. This bizarre drama is enough to be called "shocking". Wu was isolated from then on, and soon he heard of his illness, his tooth extraction changing, and his death. Then came the great funeral and so on. Wu ended his life in this way, never losing his toughness. If this gentleman had indeed become a puppet as expected by the enemy, there would have been a "North China Country" and Wang's "Central China" "China" standing side by side, the pseudo-flag of the pseudo-government? (ie, the Qing Bai flag with a yellow ribbon added) could never cross the Yellow River and flutter.

Xu Shichang lived in the British Concession in Tianjin and was a literati, so his environment was much more relaxed than Wu's. However, as a Beiyang leader and retired president, he was coveted and tested, which was beyond the ability of this 85-year-old man. Suddenly, the Japanese bandits showed their power, blockading the British and French concessions, followed by flooding. Worried and anxious, he died of illness. Although the man was old, he had been well-maintained, and if it were not for this incident, he would not have died so soon.

### Not Remembering Old Evils

— Jing Wen

"Harmony is precious" is often regarded by ordinary people as the only way to conduct oneself in the world. People always like harmony. Being able to live peacefully and calmly with the world, of course, is welcomed everywhere, and perhaps one can even "make money" because of it. In order to preserve this harmony, it is better to be hardworking and complain-free, and suffer some losses. As the saying goes, "suffering a loss is a gain." This is the idea of taking the overall situation into consideration.

However, it is not an easy thing to be calm in everything. This must have extremely deep cultivation. When someone is repeatedly rude and unreasonable to you, you always feel very depressed and angry, which evokes the long-accumulated embarrassment of the past, and old grudges and new hatreds burst out together. At this time, it is out of control and difficult to stop. After all, there are not many people in the world who can "dry their faces after being spat upon" or "offer the other cheek after someone slaps your left cheek." There are even fewer saints who "repay evil with virtue." Therefore, since ancient times, "not remembering old evils" has been praised as the supreme virtue.

However, there is a limit to not remembering old evils, and one should also look at the other party's attitude. It does not mean throwing all the previous humiliations to the winds, thinking that this is magnanimity and outstanding demeanor. In this world, one cannot erase everything and regard everyone as an unpredictable and ungrateful fellow, but if one regards everyone as a kind-hearted and compassionate good person, then one will not be able to stand and will be eliminated by the times in the competition for survival. This does not mean that we should only use the means of petty people to deal with others, but that for the sake of self-defense, we have to think from the worst. "Raising a tiger is a worry," and the matter of venomous snakes biting back is everywhere. What's more, the so-called not remembering old evils means encouraging others to correct their mistakes and return to the right path. "Laying down the butcher knife" may "become a Buddha on the spot", but if the other party has not laid down the butcher knife, you rashly abandon your prejudices and do not remember old evils, the result will definitely be the other party's taking an inch.

However, the most terrible thing is not simply not remembering old evils, but completely forgetting the losses and tricks one has suffered in the past. It is not a magnanimous demeanor, but forgetfulness and confusion. One hundred or ten years can be said to be a very short period in history, but a forgetful person will throw yesterday's lessons completely clean, and a confused person will put his second hand into the fire after his first hand has been burned! If this forgetful and confused old gentleman still does not take his forgetfulness and confusion seriously, and even boasts of the greatness of this forgetful spirit, then this gentleman, to use a Shanghai dialect, is truly "crooked" beyond redemption.

### Drinking Habit

— Yi Feng

A common saying goes, "It is easier to change mountains and rivers than a person's nature." This means that a person's habits stem from their innate character and are difficult to change. Indeed, this is often the case. As long as someone is human and not a god, they will likely have some inherent habits. Whether these habits are good or bad is a matter of personal opinion, without a definitive standard. What one person deems unacceptable, another might see as one of life's great pleasures. After all, "those who walk different paths cannot make plans together." Even scientists acknowledge that there is no absolute truth in the world, so how much more so when it comes to individual habits? For instance, a fondness for alcohol is a prime example. Let's discuss the drinking habit.

In China, wine has always been inextricably linked to scholars. Using a cup of wine to dispel the frustration in one's heart is a time-honored method for scholars to express their grievances. Although "drinking to drown sorrow only makes sorrow deeper," and one might end up rambling nonsensically after getting drunk or simply falling asleep, it can still be an effective way to temporarily numb oneself. Moreover, everyone knows that alcohol is a stimulant. It can sometimes enhance one's inspiration and stimulate creativity. Therefore, many scholars in ancient times were particularly fond of wine.

Everyone knows that "Li Bai could write a hundred poems after drinking a斗 of wine." Li Bai's literary talent, described as "writing a thousand pieces in a flash, ready to go while leaning on a horse," greatly benefited from wine. Later scholars who possessed both literary talent and a similar fondness for alcohol as Li Bai were often praised as "banished immortals."

Naturally, losing composure after drinking and revealing one's true self is unavoidable for those who enjoy alcohol. As someone put it, "Stumbling around drunk is different from being sober, the drug compels one to be unfree." This can be considered a profound observation. As for using alcohol to insult others, that is another matter. In today's world, with soaring prices and demanding lives, those who can still afford "three cups in hand" are probably few and far between. One wonders how the general wine-loving scholars are spending their sober days!

### "Seppuku" in China

— Tian Gong

The young man Zhang Dequan, who had struggled as a supervisor on various railway lines in the interior during the war against Japan, now "cut open his abdomen with a sharp blade, with fresh blood spurting to the roof, and then poured it all over his body," leaving a suicide note "requesting to be buried in the name of a civil servant of the Railway Management Committee." (As reported in the January 9th Taiwan Dispatch of the Shenbao)

In this piece of news, two points are noteworthy: the cruelty of his method of death and the poignancy of his request. Seppuku (ritual suicide by disembowelment) is rarely seen in our country and is considered somewhat bizarre. I only know that among the traditional Japanese methods of suicide, there is such a thing as seppuku, but it is a manifestation of the so-called Bushido, where they always believe that it is better to die by seppuku than to suffer humiliation, or that it is better to die by a quick and decisive seppuku than to suffer after being captured. However, today, when this traditional spirit of seppuku is no longer popular in Japan, why does it appear on a Chinese civil servant in Taiwan, which had been under Japanese rule for fifty years? And why does it appear in the administrative organs of Taiwan today, two years after its recovery? In addition to receiving materials and winning hearts, should we also receive Japanese-style seppuku? Although the cruel Japanese soldiers are laughably old-fashioned, they have gradually shed the old burden of seppuku they had been carrying for five hundred years and have clearly adopted a spirit of only allowing killing but not suicide. One can understand this by looking at how Japan still harbors the intention of making a comeback after being defeated this time. This is something that anyone should be wary of. I remember that some Japanese ambitious once said arrogantly: "Rather than being defeated by China, we would rather attack a strong enemy like Russia and perish in a truly first-class showdown." This is naturally a hypocritical and arrogant prediction, not worth mentioning, but looking at this sentence today, it does make people feel that the Japanese have this kind of psychological demand and factual manifestation. From another perspective, we should be even more vigilant that the Japanese may one day come to China again to carry out intentional or unintentional suicide, just like the Sino-Japanese War that has already ended. The petty Japanese, the mentality of "revenge" is something we cannot but guard against. At that time, their ambitions may not only be expressed in the form of personal seppuku, but also in the form of national seppuku.

It is a pity that this young civil servant could not see this. He only realized that "the salary is meager and cannot support his wife and children," and he was only humiliated by "his wife's upcoming remarriage." Since he could seek death, why could he not seek survival with the spirit of seeking death? Why could he not seek the development of his career with the spirit of seeking death? Why only ask to be buried in the name of a civil servant and not make further efforts to give himself a state funeral or other more respectable funeral? Alas, this is why this seppuku tragedy is a tragedy!

### Work-Study

— Bao Zhongqi

Students always feel that this semester is passing too slowly, having to study so many books without a break. But what about the parents? Needless to say, the approaching end of the year is a major concern for them, and the end of another semester only adds to their worries.

Originally, whether they are civil servants or small clerks, they already feel breathless from trying to keep up with the rising prices. Adding such a heavy burden—their children's tuition fees—ordinary parents collapse, and their children drop out of school.

Only students who have dropped out of school will truly appreciate the value of education. Since they lack the means to pursue their studies, and the chances of getting a scholarship are slim due to the large number of applicants, what about finding a job? The job market is already saturated, so how easy is that? They truly feel like they have "no way to go to heaven and no door to enter into the earth!" After much thought, God did not create a batch of "idle" people, unless they themselves are willing to be so, otherwise "heaven never seals off all exits." If this road is blocked, there are other ways to survive.

Then, "work-study" can be considered a last resort. Fortunately, this method is not without precedent. Many famous professors in universities and many famous scholars and great entrepreneurs in society all adopted the "work-study" method when they studied abroad. Looking back at China, this method is not necessarily unfeasible. Didn't the International Hotel recruit university students to work as waiters a few years ago? Moreover, the cost of living a few years ago was not as high as it is today, yet many students still applied. Therefore, a recent advertisement by a shoe store for university students to work as shop assistants indicates that society needs students, as long as the students are willing to lower themselves!

However, it must be said that putting it into practice is very difficult after all. Time is the biggest problem. Other than summer and winter vacations, today's students do not have much free time to spare. Watching movies and going to dance halls are just the pastimes of wealthy children! If "work-study" is implemented, it can only be limited to holidays, and they are willing to do even the lowest-paying jobs.

Students are originally those who "learn" about "life". Labor is sacred. Using it to enrich life experience, being self-reliant, and understanding the difficulty of parents earning money are all deeply meaningful, achieving multiple goals in one fell swoop. Why not promote it?

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (40)

Qiwan rushed back to Beiping just in time for the day before the funeral, and stayed overnight at home. Zhuzhai, having learned the news of Qiwan's return to Beiping, had come to the school several times to inquire of Aunt Wang every day, and sent an extremely elaborate wreath to the Gu residence. This day, after receiving a report from Aunt Wang that Qiwan had arrived, he rushed to see her, but Qiwan was not at home. According to Aunt Wang, "After the boss came back, she cried twice, and once fainted next to the coffin. She is now staying overnight at the mourning hall at number twelve across the street. The old master will be buried tomorrow, and there are many female guests there. Even if I tell her, she can't come back." Zhuzhai thought that this was true. Wanting to go over to see her, Qiwan was in mourning and could not talk to him much, so he had to instruct Aunt Wang to call him as soon as the boss returned, so that he could rush over immediately. The next day was the day of Qiwan's father's funeral procession. Zhuzhai could not participate in carrying the coffin, so he waited on the route that the coffin was sure to pass through at Caishikou. When the coffin was about to arrive, the sidewalks were already crowded with people who had come to watch, not for the sake of the famous actor's funeral, but to see the famous people of the Peking Opera world and their families, etc., who were escorting the coffin, all with a curious eye, wanting to take this opportunity to catch a glimpse of everyone's true face. As a result, as the coffin passed by, the mourning curtain was raised high, and the white cloth surrounding it was tightly wrapped, so that the faces of the sons and daughters in mourning inside the curtain could not be seen at all, only revealing many feet, all wearing white mourning shoes. Zhuzhai squeezed into the crowd, straining his eyes to identify them, but could not make out which pair belonged to Qiwan. After the funeral procession, everyone went back to their tents. It was not until about five o'clock in the afternoon that he received a call from Qiwan saying: "I am too busy today, and only have two hours to talk. Please come to see me, I'm afraid I won't have time later." Zhuzhai hurriedly rushed to Xiaochang Hutong, only to see Qiwan dressed in plain white, white clothes, white shoes, white socks, her face free of any makeup, as white as solidified fat, her eyebrows lightly brushed, set off by the deep dimples on her cheeks, with an elegant simplicity that had a special charm. When Zhuzhai pushed the door open, she was holding her beloved cat Mimi in her arms, pouting her small mouth, as if complaining that Aunt Wang had not fed it well. She looked up and saw Zhuzhai come in, immediately put her beloved cat gently on the ground, and the cat leaped at Zhuzhai's feet, circling around, raising its tail, meowing. Qiwan, leaving Mimi aside, put both hands on Zhuzhai's shoulders, her face showing a mixture of joy and sorrow, and said: "Zhu, I'm back! My father..." At this point, her voice caught in her throat. Zhuzhai was about to comfort her when he heard her say again: "Have our affairs been taken care of?" Zhuzhai couldn't help but feel a jolt in his heart, and couldn't answer for a moment. Qiwan seemed to know what he meant, and said again: "It's just a matter of time, right? When my father was alive, I never listened to him, and he loved me the most, and he was most concerned about my affairs, both big and small, he wanted to take care of everything. Now it is impossible to ask my father for instructions. My family is about to become another world, and no one cares about my marriage anymore. As for how long it takes, I don't think it matters much, I will always wait for you. I only have three days in Beiping this time. I have been busy with my father's funeral for two whole days. Tomorrow, for family matters, I will have to spend most of the day again. Besides, I have to go to the temple with my family to pay tribute to my father. I have to leave early the day after tomorrow. I don't have much time to talk to you. In short, I will wait for you no matter what."

Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Grandfather, Father, and Grandson with Only One Son The Uncle and Nephew Contend for Inheritance

Sun Lin asks: My father had three brothers, Jia, Yi, and Bing. Jia was my father, who had two sons, myself being the younger. Yi and Bing each had one son. Now the father and uncle generations have all passed away one after another. Bing's son has also passed away. My elder brother has no sons, Yi's son only has one daughter, and I have one son, just three years old. Last year, we revised the family genealogy. Yi's son wants his daughter to inherit Bing's son's property. I ask: When Bing's son passed away, my son personally handled the encoffining and burial, and followed the prescribed mourning rituals. Can he inherit Bing's son's property? Bing's son passed away unmarried at the age of twenty-one. Does his nephew have the right to inherit? Bing's son died unmarried, should Bing's property be inherited by the younger son of the Jia line? Does Bing's wife have the right to choose someone to inherit?

[Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] The current law no longer has ancestral inheritance. Bing's son died after the implementation of the inheritance chapter of the current Civil Code. For posthumous adoption, nephew inheritance, regardless of gender, is not effective, and cannot have the right to inherit Bing's son's property. Bing's wife has the right to choose someone to be her own adopted son to inherit her own property rights, but this person may not be Bing's deceased adopted son or daughter.

Zhu Xianggen Jun Jian: There are two ways to get a divorce: one is by mutual consent, which should be done in writing and with the signatures of two or more witnesses; the other is by court judgment, where one party to the marriage may petition the court for divorce if the other party has one of the circumstances listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code. A unilateral declaration in the newspaper is invalid. As stated in your letter, you can petition the court for a divorce based on Article 1052, paragraph 5 of the Civil Code, "where one party to the marriage abandons the other party in bad faith in a continuing state."
