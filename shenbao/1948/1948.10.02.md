Legislative Yuan Decides to Submit to Review; Requests Executive Yuan to Submit General Budget for Review Promptly

[Report from our Nanjing office, 1st] The 7th meeting of the 2nd session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 1st, presided over by President Sun. After the meeting was opened, the minutes of the 6th meeting were first approved, followed by the reading of Kong Geng's proposal "Please determine agricultural policy, solve production problems and land problems at the same time, in order to achieve the livelihood of the people case," and after Meng Guanghou explained on behalf, he immediately merged the proposal to formulate the Land Reform Law by Xiao Zheng et al. and the proposal to implement farmland to the tiller and city land to the city and the state-owned rich resources by Pan Lian et al. for discussion. These cases related to land issues, which continued to be debated for three meetings, were again discussed for half a day, and finally the meeting decided to submit the three cases to the Land Administration, Finance, Economic Resources, Food Administration, and Legal System committees for joint review with the approval of 151 people (255 members present). Then, the proposal by Liu Zhendong et al. to "Revise the measures for consolidating foreign currency and national currency public bonds promulgated by the Executive Yuan in order to promote fairness and reduce the burden on the national treasury" was discussed and it was decided to submit it to the Financial Committee for joint review with the "Draft Regulations on the Consolidation of Public Bonds of the Republic of China in the 37th year and the table of repayment of principal and interest of various bonds" sent by the Executive Yuan. All the members unanimously believed that the Executive Yuan's measures gave extremely disparate treatment to national currency public bonds and foreign currency public bonds, which was unfair and unreasonable. Due to a proposal by Yang Gongda, a decision was once made to request the Executive Yuan to stop implementing these measures, but since Liu's case was still pending review, it was changed to submitting a written interpellation case, requesting the Executive Yuan to reply on how to remedy this error, which was passed by the general assembly without objection.

### Xu Tao Case Prosecuted; Yuan Yang'an Not Prosecuted Due to Insufficient Evidence

[Report from our Nanjing office, 1st] The case of Xu Baiqi, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, and Tao Qiming, Secretary, who used their positions to leak secrets about the currency reform and sold Yongsha shares for profit, was transferred by the Capital Special Criminal Court to the Capital District Prosecutor's Office. The investigation has now concluded, and a public prosecution has been filed due to conclusive evidence. Yuan Yang'an has not been prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. The indictment stated the facts of Xu Baiqi's leaking of currency reform secrets as follows: "On August 18 of this year, before the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Reform, Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance, invited Xu Baiqi to the Deputy Minister's office to discuss currency reform matters and verbally instructed him to notify all banks and money shops nationwide to suspend business, ordering him to draft an order. However, after Xu finished drafting the order and left, he sent a messenger to invite Tao Qiming, a secretary in the same department, to inform him of the contents of this confidential order, and immediately consulted with him on taking the opportunity to go to Shanghai to sell shares, attempting to make a huge profit. Tao then consulted with Xu Zhuanghuai, Chief Secretary of the Nanjing China Petroleum Company of the Resources Commission, on the same afternoon, and asked him to buy plane tickets on his behalf, and flew to Shanghai, telling his wife, Li Guolan, about this confidential news, and instructing her to engage in the stock business. Then, he discussed the consequences of this news with Yuan Yang'an, and discussed how to operate the stock, but Yuan was not interested in operating the stock, so there was no result and he returned. However, after Li Guolan obtained this news, she conspired with Li Boqin and Yang Shuyao to sell shares. On the morning of the 19th, Li Guolan and others sold 7 million Yongsha shares at China-America Trading Company, making a considerable profit. Later, Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin of the Control Yuan came to Shanghai to investigate and found the facts to be true." The prosecutor then asked Yuan Yang'an about the above facts, which were mostly consistent with the written statement made by Yuan during the investigation. Although Tao Qiming claimed that "his trip to Shanghai on the 18th was purely for a visit and had no other purpose, and the sale of Yongsha shares was managed by his wife, Li Guolan," and firmly denied that he had taken the opportunity to sell Yongsha shares for profit, Tao Qiming stated when questioned by Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin of the Control Yuan, along with Zheng Haoming, Captain of the Criminal Police Team of the Capital Police Department: "To tell the truth, I did a little (referring to Yongsha shares)," and also said: "I thought at the time that whenever the government took a measure, prices would definitely fall, so I made this stock selling transaction." Asked, "On the 19th, did you (referring to Tao Qiming) do stocks based on this point (referring to the order to suspend operations of banks and money shops), judge, and tell your wife to sell short?" He replied, "Yes." Xu Baiqi stated: "He (referring to Tao Qiming) went to do business." The prosecutor also believed that Tao did not receive an urgent telegram or letter about his mother's illness when going to Shanghai. Based on the mutual corroboration of the statements of the various defendants, it can be concluded that he took advantage of the opportunity of currency reform to make profits. Therefore, it is a fact that Xu Baiqi informed Tao Qiming of this news in order to make profits, and Tao Qiming urgently asked Xu Zhuanghuai to buy tickets to fly to Shanghai and conspired with Yuan Yang'an to sell shares. In summary, the defendants leaked secrets related to national mobilization operations, which violated the first paragraph of Article 11 of the Provisional Regulations on National Mobilization, and also jointly sought to benefit from matters not under their jurisdiction, which violated the seventh paragraph of Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. However, the acts of leaking secrets and taking advantage of the opportunity to make profits committed by the defendants had a relationship between means and results, and should be punished more severely in accordance with the provisions of Article 55 of the Criminal Law. Except for Yuan Yang'an's part, which will be dealt with separately, and the Li Guolan case, which is being handled by the Shanghai Local Court, Xu Zhuanghuai will be dealt with separately after he is arrested. In accordance with Article 1 and Article 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, Article 230 paragraph 1, and Article 243 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed and sent for trial.

### Dewey Delivers Important Speech, Advocates Bi-Oceanic Diplomacy, Abandons Appeasement and Increases Aid to China

[United States News Agency, Salt Lake City, Utah, 30th] New York Governor Dewey is intensifying his presidential campaign. Tonight, he proposed a nine-point "bi-oceanic" foreign policy plan, advocating abandoning appeasement in the pursuit of world peace, promoting the establishment of a United States of Europe, and providing more aid to China.

Dewey delivered a speech to the audience in the Tabernacle here, broadcast nationwide. At that time, he reiterated that the "greatest domestic issue" facing Americans today is the "issue of world peace." Dewey urged heartfelt support for the European Recovery Program, saying: The aid program should be used to encourage Western European countries to move towards the goal of establishing a European Federation, claiming that what is "needed now is a United States of Europe."

He also promised: We will no longer neglect China, a friend and ally with whom we have a long-standing relationship.

Dewey said: Establishing a league of free European nations as a cornerstone of peace must be the primary goal of American foreign policy. He suggested establishing a demilitarized zone in the Ruhr region, placed under international administration, to meet the peaceful needs of the European Union. Dewey first assured "full support for the United Nations." Then he said: "From now on, when drafting our country's foreign policy, I must remember the lessons of Munich every day, continue to persevere, and never forget. No matter how earnestly we hope for peace, we cannot pay the price of peace with appeasement." He continued: "When we carry out our work, we must always pay attention to our confidence, which includes the following points:

(1) "We are determined to support the United Nations without any hesitation."

(2) We are determined to extend the hand of friendship and assistance to freedom-loving people around the world.

(3) The European Aid Program must have another, more significant meaning. It is not merely a bailout in itself. We will use it to promote and encourage Western European countries to form a European Union.

(4) Even when we are implementing the European recovery program, we must also end the tragic policy of abandoning our Chinese allies. The threat to peace is global. Therefore, our efforts to create peace must also be global. The last world war taught us that we must have a bi-oceanic navy. Similarly, we also need a bi-oceanic foreign policy.

(5) In such a chaotic world, we have no other way but to maintain and continue to be strong, so that no country dares to risk attacking us.

(6) Military strength alone will not help. We must continue to prosper. We must ensure that the recession and unemployment that the Communists seek do not return to our country.

(7) We will continue to strengthen cooperation with our neighboring countries in the Americas.

(8) In these difficult times, foreign policy is not limited to dealing with other governments. Our foreign policy should reflect the ideals, traditions, and aspirations of the American people. Our foreign policy should tell people everywhere the truth about America. Our ideals are justice, religion, individual dignity, and reasonable words and deeds.

(9) We will launch the spiritual power of mankind in this great moral awakening. We are determined to fight for peace with courage, unity, and indomitable spirit, so that mankind will regain confidence and hope, determination, and self-confidence will be reborn.

### Reform of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Amounts, Merchants Allowed to Add the Increased Tax to the Sales Price

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Since the reform of the currency system, in order to increase tax revenue and balance the budget, the government has promulgated supplementary measures for financial reorganization, stipulating that the collection of commodity taxes, domestic tobacco and alcohol taxes, and mineral taxes shall be based on the market wholesale price on August 19, 1937, deducting the actual tax amount of that period, and the balance shall be the tax-paid price, which shall be collected in accordance with the statutory tax rate. The tax amount determined in accordance with this new tax assessment method has been submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Economic Control Committee for resolution. The revised collection of cigarettes, smoked tobacco leaves, tin foil, foreign beer, domestic alcoholic beverages, tobacco leaves, and shredded tobacco will be implemented on October 1. However, merchants are allowed to add this increased tax amount (the amount added by the new tax category compared to the tax amount in August) to the sales price, but they must not increase it excessively (for example, cigarettes are increased by an average of about 76% based on the wholesale price on August 19, tobacco leaves by 19%, tin foil by 40%, beer by 72%, foreign wine by 45%, local wine by 70%, local tobacco leaves by 37%, and local shredded tobacco by 25%). This is because these items are all luxury consumer goods, and the tax burden should originally be passed on to consumers in accordance with the nature of the tax, so as to avoid affecting the cost of production and manufacturing, which would violate the principle of taxation. While the government is striving to balance revenue and expenditure and increase revenue, it is only implementing this on luxury consumer goods first, which is also in line with the purpose of economizing consumption, practicing diligence and thrift to build the country, and considering the people's livelihood. At this time when the great cause of suppressing rebellion and building the country is being actively promoted, the people of the country should be able to understand the government's meaning of adjusting and abolishing the tax amounts of various commodities, and unanimously support and enthusiastically contribute.

### Editorial: A Touchstone for International Financial Institutions

—The International Monetary Fund Sends a Mission to China—

The third annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development opened in Washington last month on the 27th. More than 300 representatives from 47 countries, all financial experts from various countries, gathered together, hoping to explore the future of world economic cooperation with everyone's wisdom, which is truly a grand event in the international community. Everyone knows that the post-war world economic recovery is the foundation of world peace, and now world peace is still being explored. If the international economic factors are ignored, it would be an incredible mistake. Looking forward to the future of these two international financial institutions, although it is extremely bleak and it is not easy to exert their function of promoting world economic cooperation, we still place unlimited hope on the holding of the third annual meeting.

These two major international financial institutions were born in July 1944. At that time, the war was in full swing, and it seemed that everyone was too busy to pay attention to the war. However, based on the foresight of the late US President Roosevelt, representatives of 44 United Nations countries held a world financial conference in Bretton Woods, a summer resort in the northeast corner of the United States, to prepare for various post-war world economic issues, especially the monetary issues of various countries after the war. Everyone's eyes reflected a vision of post-war world economic cooperation. After the end of the war, these two major international financial institutions were established one after another and began to carry out their tasks. Everyone had high hopes for them, especially the countries affected by the war and the countries with backward industries. The former hoped that they could assist them in recovery; the latter hoped that they could help them develop. However, the cruel facts of the past three years have told the world that these two international financial institutions are not only born with deficiencies, as the Soviet Union has never formally participated; but also suffer from acquired maladjustment, as countries around the world are suffering from a "dollar" shortage. The capital of the International Bank is nominally as high as 9.1 billion US dollars, but only the United States has paid it up, which has paid a total of 3.175 billion US dollars. The amount paid by other countries is limited. In this case, if the United States can fully support it, the International Bank may not be able to exert its function. Unfortunately, the United States does not seem willing to do so. Under Marshall's foreign aid plan, an "Economic Cooperation Administration" (E.C.A.) has been added, which has further lowered the status of the International Bank.

Therefore, the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund issued its third annual general report, and also admitted frankly that if countries do not take steps, the world's recovery will be difficult. The report stated: "Unless governments and financial authorities take steps to continue to increase production and control inflation, the world cannot recover. If we want to solve the current dollar shortage, we must increase production to increase exports." We saw the full text of the report in the China Press, and felt that it was a routine official document, and there was really nothing worthy of attention. Such extravagant talk about world economic cooperation and such empty words about world economic recovery and prosperity are nothing more than "talking on paper", which is of no benefit to reality. Especially today when the Cold War is raging and regional economies are singing high, the suggestions it puts forward are even less meaningful and effective.

However, the stability of the world economy and the functioning of international financial institutions rely on the economic recovery of various regions of the world and the development of backward industrial countries. Our Minister of Finance, Wang Yunwu, pointed out in his opening speech that the work of recovery and development in the Far East requires continued international assistance to avoid encountering a crisis. Today, under Marshall's aid to Europe plan, the United States is fully assisting the recovery of European countries, while neglecting the economic crises in other regions. From our point of view, it cannot help but commit an incredible mistake. Although this matter belongs to the issue of US foreign policy, we are unwilling to intervene, but we still cannot help but hope that international financial institutions will take action to remedy this shortcoming.

According to a report by the Associated Press on the 29th, the International Monetary Fund also attaches great importance to the economic crisis in the Far East, and is paying special attention to China's currency system reform. It plans to send a delegation to China to conduct on-site inspections and research, so as to take further measures to help China solve its monetary difficulties. If this news can be verified, it can be regarded as proof that international financial institutions are striving to invigorate and exert their functions. However, the success or failure of this move is also a touchstone for whether international financial institutions can turn incompetence into usefulness.

### The Sichuan Provincial Government Fails to Implement the Emergency Financial Measures, The Supervisory Yuan's Finance and Food Committee Decides to Submit a Corrective Proposal

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Sichuan Provincial Government has failed to effectively implement the emergency measures for finance and economics promulgated by the central government. The Finance and Food Policy Committee of the Supervisory Yuan decided on the 1st to propose a corrective proposal. The corrective proposal was based on a letter from the Sichuan-Kang District Supervisory Commissioner's Office to the Finance and Food Committee, which was submitted after review and amendment. The original proposal stated: After the Sichuan Provincial Government promulgated the emergency measures for finance and economics, it still adopted a negotiated price policy for rice prices, raising the price of each Chengdu market dou from 9 jiao to 1.8 yuan, and then increasing it to 2.3 yuan, which stimulated general commodity prices and labor prices to rise in tandem, increasing by one to two times compared with "August 19," and there is a continued upward trend. Such measures are in violation of Article 13 of the "Measures for Reorganizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control," and increase the burden on the people, which hinders the implementation of the new currency system, and should be promptly corrected by the Executive Yuan in order to seek rapid relief.

### Provincial, Municipal, and County Grain Price Controls; The Ministry of Food Stipulates Work Precautions; Crack Down on Hoarding and Severely Punish Black Market Transactions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] In order to enrich grain sources and rationally regulate military and civilian food supplies, the Ministry of Food has formulated precautions for the implementation of grain price control by provinces, municipalities, and counties, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and then circulated for implementation. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) Grain administration agencies in all provinces, municipalities, and counties should immediately designate several major local food grains as targets for strict price control, earnestly implement price limits and negotiations, and crack down on hoarding and speculation. (2) The prices of all grains should be based on the market price on August 19th, converted into gold yuan, as the highest price, and the approved prices should be reported to the Ministry of Food for record. If grain merchants are found to have raised prices without authorization or engaged in black market transactions, they should be punished in accordance with Article 6 of the "Implementation Measures for Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiation Regulations." (3) If the approved grain prices must be adjusted due to special circumstances, they should immediately comply with the provisions of Article 4 of the "Implementation Measures for Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiation Regulations" and submit them to the Price Evaluation Committee for joint review in accordance with the "Implementation Measures for Price Evaluation" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and formulate fair prices based on the actual situation, and strictly implement them. If the negotiated grain price in a grain-producing area is lower than the grain price in the city it supplies at that time, the negotiated price should be reported to the Ministry of Food for record at any time. (4) Grain administration agencies in all cities and counties may conduct registration of grain storage for production, purchase, transportation, and sale of grain. If it is an important grain consumption or transshipment market, the quantity registered above should be transferred to the Ministry of Food and the provincial grain administration agencies for record. (5) It is strictly forbidden for grain merchants to hoard grain and not supply it to the market, thereby creating panic in the market. When necessary, local grain administration agencies may conduct inventory inspections together with relevant agencies. If hoarding and speculation are confirmed, they should be punished in accordance with Article 6 of the "Supplementary Key Points for Implementing Measures to Crack Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities." (6) Grain administration agencies in all cities and counties may restrict the maximum amount of grain that each person can purchase and store, based on the local grain supply and demand and inventory situation, in order to prevent panic buying and hoarding, stimulate grain prices, and strictly prohibit grain merchants from engaging in speculative grain transactions.

### Vyshinsky Fiercely Criticizes the American Plan to Control Atomic Energy; Advocates Thorough Destruction of Atomic Weapons; Jiang Tingfu Supports the Canadian Representative's Proposal

[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 1st Broadcast: Chinese Representative Jiang Tingfu expressed his support for the Canadian representative's proposal in the United Nations Political Committee on the 1st. He said: The world should unanimously condemn the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the American proposal to control atomic energy. He said that the American proposal was passed by the majority of the Atomic Energy Commission, but it was only a moderate step to restrict national sovereignty, but even this moderate step was rejected by a few countries. The world should condemn the attitude of these few countries as reactionary. Mr. Jiang said that the Chinese delegation occupies a unique position in the debate on atomic energy, because China is in favor of the original resolution to implement atomic energy approved by the UN General Assembly on January 24, 1946. He said that China has made important contributions to atomic control, and all countries have unanimously agreed on the basic purpose of the Atomic Energy Commission, and no country has provoked other countries. National leaders, scientists and experts of all member states in the representative committee, including the Soviet Union, have unanimously given an affirmative answer to this question, which is gratifying. Mr. Jiang declared that effective guarantees must be found against secret activities and any aggressive country looting atomic factories.

[Associated Press, Paris, 1st] Soviet representative Vyshinsky fully implied in the UN Political Committee on the 1st that the Soviet Union can manufacture atomic bombs. He said, "It is wrong to only believe that there is only one country in the world that has atomic bombs!" Vyshinsky made a comprehensive attack on the American international co-management atomic energy plan. He ridiculed the American plan as a ridiculous, unreasonable, and self-contradictory old tune. He reiterated that the first step should be to ban atomic bombs and destroy all atomic bombs stored in American arsenals. Vyshinsky said that only in this way can an international control atomic energy plan be produced. Western countries have repeatedly urged the Soviet Union to accept the American control plan. Vyshinsky replied that the American plan is miscalculated and the consequences will be disastrous. He said: "China claimed this morning that it cannot manufacture atomic bombs. I am afraid that there are many countries that can announce that they cannot manufacture atomic bombs. However, there must be several countries that are unwilling to announce that they cannot manufacture atomic bombs. Therefore, this statement itself is incorrect." Vyshinsky blushed again, slapped the table and shouted loudly, saying in a scolding posture, "The United States fantasizes about cutting off atomic energy and stockpiling atomic weapons in a big way." He shouted to the Western representatives, "Why don't you express goodwill and sincerity now and ban atomic bombs and their production? Why don't you break this deadlock now? We have been painstakingly persuading you, and we still want to tell you today. The American plan is absolutely impractical, which can be seen from the American suggestion to set up a half-paralyzed international control organization. This plan is harmful and not beneficial. Because science cannot be directed by international institutions, the American plan will hinder science. He condemned the United States for destroying the resolution of the UN General Assembly to establish the Atomic Energy Commission in 1946 and turning it into waste paper. He said, "It is not difficult for us to see that in the original committee and the Security Council, some countries have been obstructing the realization of the 1946 resolution from the beginning, especially the United States, because they want to maintain the status quo so that international control cannot be produced." Vyshinsky finally said, "Before we release national sovereignty and accept international control institutions, we must first have a guarantee of truly independent and fair international control.

When Vyshinsky spoke, the simultaneous translation equipment malfunctioned. Because Vyshinsky was emotional and his hands and feet were moving, he had to swing from side to side like a fan. Therefore, after five minutes, Chairman Spaak ordered him to stop for a while so that the technicians could match the equipment. Vyshinsky humbly agreed, and then slapped the table and cursed again. Half an hour later, the broadcasting equipment failed again, and he was unhappy. He continued his speech reluctantly after it was repaired.

According to Zeng Qingji, chief executive of the group and chief of staff of the Combined Logistics Headquarters, the work in Qingdao and Tianjin is expected to be completed by the end of the month because there are fewer materials in storage. It is estimated that the work in Shanghai will be completed by the end of the year. At present, all materials are being cleared and allocated to relevant agencies for use.

### Deng Zhonghe's Defamation Case: Re-examination Pending After Another Case Ends

[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhu Zhengwen previously filed a lawsuit with the District Court against Deng Zhonghe for falsely accusing him of "intimidating bandits" and defaming his reputation. The District Court once opened the trial. Both parties held their own views, and the court debate was postponed for re-examination. The District Court believed that this case was closely related to the case of Zhu Zhengwen reporting Deng Zhonghe as a traitor. After the Zhejiang High Procuratorate in Hangzhou obtains the results of the investigation into Deng's case of being accused of being a traitor, it will then transfer the files for reference and trial.

### Longhua Airport: Strict Inspection, Preventing Imposters from Escaping to Hong Kong

[Reported by This Newspaper] The customs is mainly responsible for the inspection of passengers coming and going at Longhua Airport. In addition to the customs, there are foreign affairs police and military police. The former examines the passports of foreigners, and the latter examines passengers with military status. Recently, in order to prevent some people from escaping to Hong Kong, the authorities have implemented a registration application method. The Garrison Command sends four members of the garrison team every day to check the faces of the boarding passengers according to the passenger application approval letter before the Hong Kong-bound passenger plane takes off to prevent impersonation. Since the implementation, no such malpractice has been found. In addition, the Central Bank sends three staff members to collect and exchange gold notes carried by arriving passengers at the airport import office every day. Transit passengers can exchange a part of them to be used during their stay, and the remaining amount is handed over to the customs for safekeeping, and the original amount will be returned to them when they leave Shanghai and board the plane.

### Mayor Discusses Various Issues: Special Donation Proceeds Smoothly, Likely to Exceed Target; Fine Reduction for Vehicles Violating Dance Ban Not Yet Approved

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government to inquire about various issues such as the dance ban and special donations. The Mayor answered each question as follows: (1) Regarding the dance ban, no central government order has yet been received, so the current situation will be temporarily maintained. However, a thorough rectification of the undesirable atmosphere in dance halls will be carried out. Dance hall managers and unlicensed underground dance halls are being actively investigated and suppressed. (2) Regarding the fact that the special donation for relief has not yet ended, the fundraising efforts are still ongoing. The authorities have not set a rigid deadline for the special donation, as the more donations received, the better. Currently, the special donation targets are concentrated on importers who have obtained government-official foreign exchange. It is hoped that 2% of the foreign exchange they apply for can be extracted as a donation. If fundraising is successful, the special donation may exceed the target. The funds received have already been remitted to the Central Bank. After the stipulated amount is turned over to the Central Government, the remaining funds will be transferred to the Garrison Brigade and used for refugee relief. (3) In order to suppress the price of pedicabs, the Municipal Government has reduced the fines for vehicle violations. This has been approved by the Municipal Council. It was resolved that fines for motor vehicles will range from one yuan to thirty yuan, and fines for non-motor vehicles will range from one jiao to one yuan (currently, the minimum fine for pedicabs is one yuan), so that pedicab drivers cannot use fine adjustments as an excuse to raise prices. (4) Regarding the issue of relocating refugees from this city to Ganzhou for land reclamation, the Social Affairs Bureau will first send personnel to Jiangxi to liaise with the provincial government. Because the procedures for relocating refugees are more troublesome, it is planned to first send a small number of strong and able-bodied people. If the results are significant, more will be sent in the future. (5) Regarding the issue of recovering the racecourse, it was originally planned to exchange the Jiangwan Racecourse for it, but this was not approved by the Central Government. After repeated negotiations with the racecourse authorities by the Municipal Government, the other party indicated that the principle of recovery could be accepted, but two conditions were proposed: that horse racing be allowed to resume and that the land in western Shanghai be exchanged for it. The Municipal Government will invite representatives from the City Council for further review within the next few days.

### Scalpers Infiltrate Seamlessly; Long Lines Visible Everywhere

Wool yarn, cigarettes, Western medicine, etc., are all being snapped up. It is unheard of for people to occupy land outside pharmacies all night long.

[Report from our newspaper] The trend of rushing to buy supplies has recently intensified, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Cui Fan cotton yarn, cotton cloth, woolen fabric, cigarettes, wool yarn, and Western medicine, as "daily necessities," are all targets of panic buying. Even luxury items such as diamond rings, gold jewelry, and watches are being purchased. Nanking Road and Avenue Joffre are crowded with woolen and cotton cloth stores all day long, with so many customers that the thresholds are worn through. The sales figures are several times higher than usual. Goods that are seasonal and in high demand are particularly popular. Stores selling these goods are unable to supply them without restrictions due to reasons such as price limits, cost, and reduced deliveries from manufacturers. Wholesale sales have mostly been suspended, and retail sales are also limited each day until sold out. As demand is high and supply is low, a squeezing phenomenon occurs. Reporters have patrolled the city for several days and found "long snake lines" everywhere. The panic buying queues are mostly controlled by "scalpers," who queue up day and night to buy goods and then resell them for profit, treating queuing as a regular business, so that genuine consumers cannot buy them. What we have seen and heard is described as follows:

Daily Limit Sold Out in an Instant

Wool yarn is currently in season. Although the factory deliveries to major wool yarn stores on Xingsheng Street have been reduced repeatedly, they are still doing their best to maintain retail sales by selling off their inventory. In this area alone, the total number of limited quantities sold each day reaches over 20,000 pounds, but most of it falls into the hands of "scalpers." People start queuing up every evening, and it becomes even more lively at night, with an estimated total of 8,000 to 9,000 people. Each merchant starts selling at 9:00 AM, and by 9:30 AM, all the daily limited quantities have been sold out. According to the person in charge of the trade association, the daily retail sales volume is determined by the amount of inventory in the store, with a maximum quantity of thousands of pounds for stores with more inventory, and three to four hundred pounds for stores with less. Since "August 19th," the factory deliveries have been greatly reduced. The four major wool yarn manufacturers, Anle, China, Shanghai, and Yumin, have delivered less than one-tenth of their usual quantities since "August 19th," with the largest delivery being only 750 pounds (total for over 40 days), which is not enough to supply one day of retail sales, so the limited quantities sold in the future can only be reduced and cannot be increased. After the "scalpers" purchase the wool yarn, most of it is resold to department stores in suburban areas or neighboring counties. Those setting up stalls for resale have decreased recently due to police crackdowns.

"Flying Fortresses" Maintain Order

The Mao Ming South Road First Retail Department of the Textile Construction Company distributes government subsidized flat-price women's woolen cloth and canvas brand wool yarn and blue shirting cloth from its own factory on behalf of the Aftermath Relief Supplies Management Committee of the Executive Yuan. Because of its reasonable price and quality, it is very popular among citizens. The crowding of panic buyers is no different from that on Xingsheng Street. People queue up as early as 5:00 or 6:00 PM, sleeping on the roadside, waiting to buy in turn the next morning. Although there are many genuine customers among them, there are also many "scalpers." Every morning when the store opens, "Flying Fortresses" from the Public Security Bureau must be requested to maintain order.

Unique Queueing Techniques

Sales of Western medicines such as pure cod liver oil, vitamin injections and tablets, and penicillin have increased sharply. Pharmacy retail sales have generally increased two or three times compared to before. Various finished medicines produced by famous manufacturers such as American Eli Lilly and Swiss Roche are no longer available. Strive's stock of pulmonary disease-specific medicine is extremely low. Not only is it regarded as a treasure in the medical community, but some people are also buying it on the black market at high prices. The Huamei Pharmacy on Fuzhou Road and Shandong Road stipulates that 25 injections will be sold each day. The "scalpers" have launched a unique "rush purchase." They go to the entrance of Huamei to queue up after lunch every day. Those who come later retreat automatically when they see that the number of people has reached 25, and the order is orderly. Someone replaces them for meals, and family members bring bedding after 10:00 PM. The sidewalk becomes a temporary dormitory, where they spread out their bedding and sleep on the ground. In the early morning, users who urgently need to buy pulmonary disease medicine come to negotiate to buy "seats." They earn money by selling their "seats," and this completes their work for the day. After resting for five or six hours at home, they come back to queue up after lunch to earn the next day's "topping fee." They even call themselves "serving patients."

Larger Tobacco Shops Consider Closing

High-quality domestic cigarettes can also only be purchased by queuing. The limited goods delivered to each tobacco shop are sold out as much as possible, often within one or two hours. According to people in the industry, the inventory of tobacco shops has been cleared out, and the manufacturer deliveries have been greatly reduced. For example, Yizhong's Three Cannon Platform and Huacheng's Big Beautiful cigarettes have reportedly only been delivered twice since August 19th. The principle of operating cigarettes has always been to make small profits and sell more, but now that it is impossible to sell more, expenses have become a problem. Larger tobacco shops are mostly considering closing down.

The reporter visited an economic expert to solicit opinions on the recent panic buying of supplies and the crackdown on scalpers. According to him, "scalpers" are indeed hateful and should be severely cracked down on by the authorities. However, the widespread panic buying of supplies by citizens also deserves attention. Furthermore, manufacturers using "lack of raw materials" as an excuse to reduce deliveries or stop deliveries, causing the shops' supply of goods to have problems, is also something that urgently needs to be resolved.

### Economic Strongholds on the Western Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: A Glimpse of an Export-Surplus Production Area

— By Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Aboard a flight from Nanchang, Jiangxi, 28th] The Zhangshu-Zhuzhou section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is a section of the economic route in South China. It now bears the great mission of supplying high-quality coal and constructing the new Zhuzhou industrial area. The commercial centers along this 356-kilometer railway line are in Zhangshu and Yichun, while the industrial strongholds are budding strongly in Pingxiang and Zhuzhou. After my previous visit to the railway line, I felt deeply that the economic foundation of the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was completely different from the desolate mountains and plains of the eastern section, and that the western section showed the economic veins of the entire line.

However, medicine is ineffective if it doesn't pass through Zhangshu. Zhangshu is known for its medicinal materials. However, this ancient medicinal material market is only a collection and distribution center, not a local production area. In the past, when transportation on the south bank of the Yangtze River was not yet developed, the medicinal material business of provinces such as Hunan, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong was mostly concentrated in Zhangshu. Therefore, there are also particularly many people engaged in the medicinal material business here. As the saying goes, "Medicine is ineffective if it doesn't pass through Zhangshu." This means that each time you buy a batch of medicinal materials, you cannot get all kinds of Chinese medicinal materials, the "tree bark and grass roots," without going to Zhangshu to stock up. At the same time, because there are many merchants engaged in the medicinal material business here, counterfeit products will naturally not escape the eyes of insiders. In the past, Zhangshu's medicinal material industry was Jiangxi's largest export item.

However, traditional Chinese medicine has already embarked on a "downhill" journey, and the business of engaging in this industry is naturally also declining. Moreover, the transportation center of provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, and Guangxi has shifted to Hankou due to railway and waterway transportation. Therefore, Zhangshu's medicinal material business has naturally also shifted its "battlefield" with the changing environment. Therefore, although the market in Zhangshu is more lively than other towns in Jiangxi, the internal decline is beyond salvation. Moreover, the merchants engaged in the medicinal material business all adhere to old rules and do not know how to improve; everything is equivalent to a secret transmission.

Doing Business with a Wooden Pole

The east bank of Zhangshu is the "camp" of the medicinal material industry, while the west bank is also the home of a business that travels thousands of miles—the log raft merchant. Most of the log raft merchants and timber exporters on the Gan River are from Zhangshu. They have been fighting against the wind and waves of the river by supporting themselves with a wooden pole from before the war until now.

Coral's citrus sideline business, honey, is a special product of Jiangxi. The annual output is estimated to be around 2,000 dan, and it is sold throughout the province and in the Beijing-Shanghai area. This special product takes Zhangshu as its distribution center, so Zhangshu is an economic stronghold on the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.

Yichun is a general market for counties such as Shanggao, Wanzai, Xinyu, and Fenyi under the jurisdiction of western Jiangxi. It has the convenience of railway, highway, and Yuan River transportation. Wanzai's summer cloth and firecrackers, and Yichun's ramie, lacquerware, and preserved eggs are all famous products with abundant production. It stands in the economic and commercial leadership position in western Jiangxi, and some customs are clothed in a "Hunan style" because they are close to Hunan.

Pingxiang's Side Businesses

Pingxiang is a prosperous area. Underground, there are abundant coal reserves that can be developed for the next 40 years. Although the grain production in rural areas cannot be self-sufficient, it has several side businesses—firecrackers, papermaking, porcelain making, and weaving—that enable men, women, young, and old to produce throughout the year, which contributes to the increasing stability of the rural economy. Therefore, Pingxiang's education has been able to achieve today's results, and it should also be attributed to the hardworking rural people. They not only maintain their personal and family lives, but also increase public property and promote the development of education and construction.

Xi is a town in Pingxiang. The firecrackers produced here are no less than those from Wanzai. They can be sold to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Hankou, and even Nanyang and the United States. Now, the firecracker industry is working hard to improve, paying attention to decoration and firepower.

The porcelain of Liling and Pingxiang cannot be compared with Jingdezhen due to limited manpower and funds, but its products focus on daily necessities and electrical materials, unlike Jingdezhen's artistic products, which can only be supplied for the display and play of the general leisure class. Therefore, the porcelain of Liling and Pingxiang still has a bright future.

Survey of Products

The economy of the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is an export-surplus production area. We can understand this clearly from a simple and clear investigation table (see the table below).

The total production of the products listed in the summary table, excluding the consumption of the local counties, may have an export of 1 million dan of grain, 50 million tons of coal, 1 million dan of miscellaneous grains, 1.5 million pieces of porcelain, 2 million pieces of lacquerware, 300,000 dan of paper, and 400,000 bolts of summer cloth. In the future, these surplus rural materials will all depend on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to increase their production and sales.

### Autumn Rains in Qinghai Damage Highways

[Report from Lanzhou, 1st] The continuous autumn rains in Qinghai have damaged the highways that are being repaired again. The Qilin River has risen again, and the embankment has collapsed in many places. According to a telegram from Xining on the night of the 30th, local laborers are still repairing the main transportation routes in the rain.

South-Zhuzhou Section Project

The victorious connection of the 1,150-kilometer Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the completion of the safe trial run are the result of the staff actually working at the front and those planning the project at the rear racking their brains and exhausting their efforts to accomplish this great task.

We met Vice Chief Engineer Sun Wei of Guangding in the snow-filled Liangjiadu construction site last winter. This time, he led the inspection team of the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau and we met again on the South-Zhuzhou section. On the train, he recounted the restoration project of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He said that the mileage of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway at the time of its restoration was only 77 kilometers. Since the end of the 35th year [1946], we have been actively carrying out the project despite all kinds of difficulties. The first step was the opening of the Quzhou-Shangrao section and the Zhuji-Jinhua section. The second step was to connect Jinhua to Quzhou and Jiujiang to Nanchang. The third step was to connect Shangrao to Nanchang and Zhuzhou to Pingxiang. This was the progress of the restoration project last year. This year, in order to strive for the opening of the entire line, although limited by the funds for materials, we still overcame many difficulties with the spirit of the staff and completed the fourth step of the Xiangtang to Zhangshu and the fifth step of the Zhangshu to Pingxiang project in just seven months.

Spirit of Hard Work

Today, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has three guests—the spirit of hard work, light-weight steel rails, and wooden trestle bridges—which may not be available to other railways.

The laborers at the front are working hard, and the senior cadres planning the project at the rear are also supporting them through difficult and arduous circumstances. Last year, in the snow and ice, Director Hou Jiayuan sat in Nanchang to supervise the opening of the Shangrao-Nanchang section and the Liangjiadu Bridge, and constantly went to the construction site to "boost morale," so that the project was completed on schedule. If an unfortunate event occurs on a certain section during the journey, the person in charge of the relevant department of the Railway Bureau must immediately go to the place where the incident occurred to handle the aftermath. Zhou Yuangu, the director of the Mechanical Engineering Department, personally tested the train and inspected the construction site when the Rao-Nanchang section opened last year.

Light-weight Steel Rails

The light-weight steel rails currently used on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are the original steel rails of the Hangzhou-Tingzhou Railway, the predecessor of the "Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway." In the current stage of railway engineering, most of the railways use heavy rails of 70 pounds or more. Therefore, these light-weight steel rails have long been regarded as scrap iron. However, today's Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is so short of materials that it cannot even cope with the situation. Even this batch of "scrap iron" is regarded as a treasure. These light-weight steel rails can be laid for about 21 kilometers. In the previous year, they were moved from the Qu-Rao section to the Nan-Rao section. Now, they are reappearing in their old state on the Xinyu-Yichun section of the Nan-Chun section. Therefore, when traveling on the newly built road surface and arriving at the section of light-weight steel rails, special care is taken for safe driving. When we passed through that section of light rails between Xin and Yi this time, the speed of the train was only 6 kilometers per hour, which is almost one-fifth of the speed of travel in other areas. This difficulty was caused by the lack of materials at the time and the inability to cope with the situation, so we moved it up. Now, the Bureau is investing in a method to make it "retire" and replace it with new rails. An "old Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway" employee still has high hopes for this "treasure" and said that in the future, if the branch lines or even the Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines are still as difficult as they are today, I am afraid that this guest will still have a day when he is "conscripted into the army."

Wooden Trestle Bridges

There is another "guest," which is that wood is always used on the "Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway" to replace steel, and the safety of travel and the tonnage of load are no less than those of imported steel goods.

Wooden arch frames and wooden trusses are railway bridges made entirely of wood and iron nails. In the country, in addition to the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, which used this type of bridge in the past, other railways have no precedent. Abroad, only the Soviet Union occasionally uses it.

### Qiongdong Island Awaits Disaster Relief

[Report from Haikou, Hainan Island, 1st] Gale-force winds and torrential rain, with a force of 45 miles per hour, hit Qiongdong Island fiercely at around 1:00 AM on the 27th and only stopped at 10:00 AM. The losses in Haikou alone were heavy. More than 200 houses collapsed, and about 40 people were killed or injured. Hundreds of people were left homeless. Various sectors formed the September 27th Disaster Relief Committee and obtained 10,000 yuan from the Central Bank to carry out emergency relief. Land and water transportation had not yet been restored as of the 29th, but telecommunications had been restored.

[Another telegram] According to preliminary statistics, the losses from the wind and flood disaster in Haikou include 245 collapsed tile houses, 359 thatched houses, 1,539 disaster victims, 21 deaths, and a loss of more than 530,000 yuan in property.

### Female Teacher's Marriage Change Case; Xing Yuzhen Stabbed to Death; He Xiangsheng Turns Himself in to the Cheng Police Bureau

[Report from Jiangyin, 1st] He Xiangsheng, an out-of-towner, and his wife, Xing Yuzhen, both worked as elementary school teachers. Xing and her lover, Miao Ruixiang, were studying together in Suzhou. One day, she returned to Cheng (Jiangyin) to go through divorce proceedings with her husband. In the afternoon, she was stabbed in the abdomen with a sharp knife by her husband in Wu Temple Lane and died. He turned himself in to the police bureau, and Miao was also detained. The legal resolution is pending.

### Wuxi Private Gold and Silver Standard Offender Escorted to Zhenjiang Special Criminal Court for Trial

[Report from Zhenjiang, 30th] In the case of the private operation of gold trading by Yuanyuan Bank outside the North Gate of Wuxi, Chairman Ding of the Provincial Government dispatched Zhang Da, the Chief of the Security Protection Division of the Security Command, to investigate on the 26th. On the 28th, he finally seized the criminals and the stolen goods, including 28 taels of gold and more than 4,800 taels of silver. The criminals in this case, Xu Xiyong, Bao Danqing, You Jinan, Wu Xiqing, Xian Tingliang, and Xian Fuzeng, were all escorted to Zhenjiang on the morning of the 30th. The section in the newspapers of Beijing and Shanghai on the 29th stating that a transmitter was seized at the same time was a mistake for a wireless radio.

### Receipt of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies Totalling Over 370 Million Yuan
The total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currencies received by national banks and their authorized agents in this city from August 23rd to September 30th is as follows: 1,115,552.808 taels of gold; 923,322,016 taels of silver; 3,564,189 silver dollars; 3,742,134 jiao (dimes, double hao); $32,799,894.82 in US dollars; 13,555.15 pesos in Philippine currency; totaling 372,466,716.60 gold yuan.

Cotton Yarn: Initially Firm, Then Flat; Rumors Abound in the Fabric Market.
Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw brisk opening trades with a rising trend. Both coarse and fine yarns were scarce. 16-count coarse yarn was only available under the "Deputy Brand Red Man Clock" variety, priced at 580 yuan. 21-count "Double Horse" yarn remained at 783 yuan. 20-count yarn hovered around the limit, with active trading. 10-count yarns of various brands were adequately supplied; apart from "Boy Scout", "Jia He", and "Red Man Clock" which were relatively firm, other brands did not experience significant price fluctuations.

Fine yarns such as 40-count "Jin Cheng" and 42-count "Jin Shuang Ji" rose by 15 to 10 yuan, while 40-count "Jin Shuang Ji" saw a slight decline of 12 yuan. 32-count and 60-count yarns remained stable. Later, with the approach of the yarn allocation period for the Textile Construction Company and the authorities beginning warehouse inspections, scattered sellers emerged, leading to a market trend that was initially firm but later flattened.

Further news: The Textile Construction Company offered 20-count "Red Lion" brand yarn at 700 yuan, limited to dyeing and weaving businesses and yarn numbers registered from 1 to 300.

Yesterday's cotton fabric market opened with rumors claiming that the cost of "Dragon Head" fine cloth was lower than that of "Four Gentlemen" yuan beige, yet the price limit for "Dragon Head" fine cloth was 29.5 yuan, while the limit for "Four Gentlemen" yuan beige was 28.5 yuan, deemed unreasonable. Some suggested reducing the price limit of "Dragon Head" fine cloth by 1.5 yuan to 28 yuan. Simultaneously, the guild received a call from the supervision office, stating that the price of "Dragon Head" fine cloth should not exceed 28 yuan, which was immediately relayed to all members for compliance, causing a sudden drop in confidence. Traders became hesitant, and scattered sellers sold off their holdings, with only shops along Fujian Road showing interest.

Jiao Tong University Increases Recurring Expenses; Simplifies Curriculum and Emphasizes Basic Subjects

[Our Correspondent] Wang Zhiche, acting president of Jiao Tong University, spoke with reporters yesterday about his trip to Nanjing to discuss funding and other matters with the Ministry of Education. He stated that: (1) Due to the Ministry of Education's consideration of the special needs of science and engineering colleges, the university's recurring expenses have been increased significantly. Since the increase in the second new budget, monthly expenses are approximately 20 billion legal tender, more than thirty times the amount before the implementation of the constitution. It is hoped that the university will not face financial difficulties in the future. (2) Regarding staffing quotas, the Ministry has approved an increase of eighteen teaching positions and thirty-four service positions. The latter is to compensate for the university's overstaffed technical staff. Although it falls short of the university's expectations, it will alleviate some of the difficulties. Further requests for increases will be made to the Ministry of Education after comprehensive research and planning. (3) Based on feedback from various sources, it is generally agreed that the number of course credits in each department of the university is excessive. It is imperative to simplify the curriculum, emphasize basic subjects, and increase students' understanding. (4) Many senior professors at the university have been teaching for ten to twenty years, but their qualifications have not been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education due to lost documents and publications. After inquiring with the Higher Education Department, it was reported that the review of professor qualifications must be approved by the Academic Review Committee, and the Ministry is unable to change the regulations of the committee. The Higher Education Department plans to propose simplified measures at the next meeting of the Academic Review Committee, hoping to both comply with regulations and resolve practical difficulties.

Willing to Cooperate in Maintaining Peace; Grateful for Other Countries Pointing Out Mistakes; US Consul General in Shanghai Speaks at St. John's University

More Terrible Weapons Under Development; Another War Will Inevitably Lead to the Destruction of Human Civilization

[US Information Service, this city] US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, delivered a speech at St. John's University on the first of this month, stating in brief: These are difficult times, and China is unfortunately in the midst of civil unrest. The people of other countries are also in a state of panic because the international situation continues to deteriorate. New and more terrible weapons are being researched and developed, and if the world were to have another war, it could lead to the destruction of both Eastern and Western civilizations. These civilizations were created by humanity after thousands of years of effort. Among the young people in school today, there must be many who will be the future intellectual leaders of China. I ask you to minimize international discord and not provoke it when determining your ideas. Today, no country can avoid its international responsibilities, and if we shirk our responsibilities today, we cannot avoid war. The American people have resolved not to shirk their responsibilities any longer. Today, we are showing with our actions around the world that we are willing to cooperate in maintaining peace. We may make mistakes, but we are grateful to friends from other countries who point out these mistakes. But if these unintentional mistakes are regarded as malicious attempts, it will cause great damage to world peace. Although the American people love peace so much, they cannot guarantee full democracy and freedom for people everywhere. Therefore, other like-minded people must cooperate. People who love peace, freedom, truth, and human progress must work together in harmony and understanding so that modern civilization can blossom and bear fruit, and human dignity can be upheld. In this way, we can prove that there is indeed a spark of divinity within us to explain the difference between humanity and animals.

Free Talk Credit and Expediency Er Jia

In the year of Bingxu in the Xian Tong era of the Tang Dynasty, the emperor ascended to the Danfeng Tower on October 10th. The day before, it rained, and the authorities ordered the city's good soil to level the waterlogged areas in front of the tower. At that time, Li Gongwei was the magistrate of Zhengzhou. The soil sellers seized the opportunity of the emergency and deliberately raised prices, wanting to take advantage of the situation. The officials of the two counties reported to Li Gong and said: "Those who sell soil usually lose ten, dozens, or three. Now, they take advantage of the emergency and suddenly increase the price by ten to seven. We are willing to execute their leaders to reduce the price." Li Gong said: "The matter is urgent, how can we prioritize the price!" So he ordered each cart to add money to one hundred and two, so the carts gathered like clouds. By dusk, the waterlogged areas were leveled and dried. After ascending the tower, the soil sellers went to the government to ask for money, but they were still given fifty coins. Because this was a government matter, they did not dare to argue, and the matter was over. Can Liaozi thought that Li Gong had obtained the way of expediency, first adding to one hundred, so as to lure them to come, and finally reducing it by half, so as to punish their greed. Is this the number of capture and release? As far as I am concerned, I don't think so.

The use of the people by the officials should be based on good faith. Starting with a price of one hundred and two to lure them, and then cutting it off and not giving it, this is directly cheating the people, how can it be called expediency? If there are such things again, even if the price is double that of one hundred and two, the people will think they are being deceived and will not come. In this matter, since the price of one hundred and two was added first, it should be given in full to maintain its good faith, and then the leader who deliberately raised the price should be severely punished to show the law, so that good faith is not lost, and the people are grateful and know their superiors. Expediency is just a political skill, while credit is the basis of governance.

Remembering Moling in the Rain and Wind Zhu Lankel

The wind and rain have been sad for several nights. Although there is no sound of rain on the 残荷near my residence to increase the thoughts of loneliness, the branches on the steps, the branches in front of the court, and the eaves are all full of autumn. Autumn is originally lovely, especially the autumn in Jiangnan, because it is particularly short, just like a beautiful and quiet short dream, ethereal and fleeting, so it is especially cherished. I have been away from Nanjing for almost three years, and the old travels in Stone City have become dreams. "The first difficult thing to forget in Stone City is when you hear the rain by the Zhuque Bridge." This is my nostalgic poem about Nanjing. Indeed, the autumn and the wind and rain in Moling are always worth remembering. In this sparse rain and cold window, I can't help but linger on the past.

The ancients often said in their papers: "Gorgeous and return to plainness." For example, the famous sentence of Da Jing Tang: "Ten days of rain and silk in the wind, the strong spring smoke scene is like the remnant autumn." is a proof that plainness is better than gorgeousness. Mochou Lake is the place in Nanjing that can represent plainness, especially in late autumn, with shadows of mountains on all sides, half a lake of ruined lotus, a few treacherous

[Our Newspaper Report] Communist bandits have been wreaking havoc in Muyang County, cutting down almost all the grown trees at will. Due to the intense battles in Northern Jiangsu, the Communist bandits are forcing farmers to cut down large quantities of the remaining trees to build fortifications in a last-ditch effort.

### Jingjiang's Nie Flees to the Bandits in Panic; Battalion and Regiment Commanders Remain Upright and Unyielding

[Our Newspaper Report from Jingjiang on the 29th] Jingjiang, a small county town, although it is a corner of northern Jiangsu, it stands out in the middle of the river due to its topography, and is only separated from Jiangyin and Wujin by a narrow strip of water, which can be crossed in a moment. Militarily speaking, it is indeed a shield and barrier for the capital. When the Communist bandits loudly proclaimed "Crossing the Yangtze in May," three or four regiments gathered in the western district of Jingjiang, preparing to forcibly cross from the Jiagang area. The important garrisons of Najiawei and Jujiawei were lost one after another because the local troops were weak and reinforcements did not arrive. At that time, the situation was truly precarious. Li Tianxia, Deputy Commander of the First Pacification District, once came to Jingjiang to take charge, and transferred most of the Nie Brigade of the 23rd Division from Huangqiao, Taixing, to Jingjiang.

Brigade Commander Nie Tingbin

The "Defected General's" Old Subordinate

Brigade Commander Nie Tingbin is from Kaifeng, Henan. He was an old subordinate of "Defected General" Feng Yuxiang. Later, he followed Hao Pengju, served in the puppet army, and even joined the Communist army. After the victory, he surrendered with Hao. The central government was magnanimous and did not hold him accountable for his past deeds, assigning him to his current position. After his troops arrived in Jingjiang, they crowded the streets and lanes. Nine out of ten households were soldiers. There was not a single soldier to be seen outside the city. The number of wives accompanying the troops was even more countless. Battalion and company commanders naturally brought their wives, and there was no platoon leader without a wife. In the small city of Jingjiang, the issue of "accommodation" became a problem, because every wife needed a house! Thus, the people were ordered to "share rooms," "vacate shops," and "empty rooms," one after another being settled in!

Wives Need Houses

Meat, Oil, etc., Provided Free of Charge

As for food, grain was issued as dependents' rations. Meat, vegetables, and oil, as well as firewood, were all supplied free of charge by the military-civilian cooperation stations. For example, when the market price of meat was 1.2 million yuan per catty, the brigade headquarters stipulated that the selling price for both wives and officers was limited to 120,000 yuan, with unlimited supply. The huge deficit was borne by the people, who dared not complain. The only complaint was about the construction of defensive fortifications. For example, the earthen city wall mobilized thousands of people every day, taking more than two months to complete. As soon as it was finished, Vice Brigade Commander Fan issued an order to move it all three meters into the city wall and start all over again.

Constructing Defensive Fortifications

Stop Only When Gold is Dug Up

The controlled area was only a circle of the city wall. Working, working, building and then demolishing, demolishing and then building, for four or five months, without stopping. Someone asked him, "When will this be finished?" He bluntly said: "We'll stop whenever we dig up gold!" His intention was nothing more than to exhaust the people, make them resent the government, and benefit the bandits. The people could only endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, hoping that the bandits would be wiped out soon, or that the 23rd Division would be transferred!

In the last ten days of this month, it was said that the entire 23rd Division was going to be transferred. Sure enough, on the 24th, the advance troops of the 230th Division arrived at Bawu Port. Everyone stretched their necks, hoping to see them arrive soon.

Convene a Symposium

Hold a Dinner Party to Prepare to Defect to the Bandits

Who knew that at this moment, Nie Tingbin thought that time was pressing and could no longer be delayed, so on the 26th, he gathered the company and platoon leaders at the Liu residence to hold a symposium. First, he distorted the facts and attacked the government. As a result, he semi-openly told them that he was preparing to defect to the bandits. At noon on the 27th, he gathered officers above the rank of battalion commander for a meeting. At the same time, he distributed invitations, inviting the heads of various agencies and organizations in the county and gentry to a dinner party at four o'clock in the afternoon. His plan was to wipe them all out during the rebellion as a gift for meeting the bandits. During the meeting, he openly announced that he would defect to the bandits that night, and told them that the bandit army had already reached Baimuqiao, and that as soon as they launched an attack, they would immediately arrive in the city. At that time, Zhang, the battalion commander of the Fourth Regiment, stood up first and said, "Does the division commander know about this?" Nie said, "He—Division Commander Bi Shujiao—is stubborn." Zhang said, "If the division commander doesn't know, I'm afraid there will be many inconveniences!" "We should obey the division commander's orders!" Zhang added. Nie was furious and immediately ordered his trusted guards to tie up Zhang, preparing to execute him. The other officers dared not speak up and had to obey! At that time, Cui Fengming, the regiment commander of the Fourth Regiment, pretended to be preparing to gather his troops and secretly sent a confidant to Huangqiao Division Headquarters to report the secret. Division Commander Bi knew that the situation was critical and immediately drove to Jingjiang. However, when the car reached Gushan—ten miles from the city—the engine unfortunately malfunctioned, so he ran to the outside of Beiguan.

The Plot Suddenly Exposed

Two Platoons Fled in Panic

Nie heard that the division commander had arrived and knew that the plot had been exposed, so he fled out of the east gate with more than two platoons of men in a hurry, without even having time to put on their military caps, with bare heads. By the time Division Commander Bi entered the city to deploy troops to pursue them, Nie had already turned north from Chenjiaci and fled to the bandit area. Division Commander Bi, because the incident was unexpected, was afraid that there were still bandits lurking in the city, so he immediately announced martial law, checked the household registration, and established close contact with the 230th Division to rush to hand over the defense. On the 28th, Division Commander Xu took over the defense, with strict discipline, and the city was not disturbed. The cooperation station delivered military grass as a substitute, paying the market price for each load. At noon, upon hearing an alarm in Jishi, Division Commander Xu personally led his troops to relieve the siege. From then on, the people of Jingjiang could probably breathe a sigh of relief!

### Arrivals Scarce, Transactions Nearly Cease; Rice Has Prices But No Sales; Flour Sales Suspended, Oil Prices Continue to Be Firm

Rice transactions are nearly ceasing, and arrivals are scarce. Merchants are offering samples that are almost equal to zero. There are no rice samples on the sample tables of the dealers. Although trading houses still list prices as usual, they are not making any transactions. Rice shops cannot buy rice. By 10:30 AM, people have already left the market. Yesterday, almost no transactions were made. The prices reported in the market are for rice with prices but no sales. Yesterday's arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 1,180 shi and five dou.

Flour sales remain suspended. Although dealers gather, they do not make transactions, and the number of people is small. The market scene is desolate.

Transactions in miscellaneous grains are nearing their end. Around 400 bags of soybeans were offered and quickly bought out. A few dozen bags of corn and sorghum each were sold. Tea beans, red sorghum, broad beans, etc., were not offered. There were still many sesame transactions. Unprocessed peanuts were not offered.

Edible oil continues to be firm. Bean oil factories are selling, with the highest price being 51.5 yuan, an increase of 4 to 5 jiao. Rapeseed oil is sold at a limited price. The supply of raw oil is scarce. Cooked rapeseed oil is stable. Small cart sesame oil is sold at a limited price. Bean cake factories are not selling, resulting in no supply and no transactions.

Sugar Market Continues to Be Firm

The sugar market's trend yesterday was still favorable. Buying interest in the market was very strong, and sentiment was firm. Transactions were brisk. The initial trend of the 20th-term Taiwan red warehouse receipt was still flat, but later there was the most buying, and supply turned scarce. The market condition generally rose sharply. Other sugars, such as medium sugar, coarse sugar, and refined white sugar, all rose together. The supply of Xinghua white sugar was abundant in the market, and the market condition was soft.

Tea Market Firm and Stable

Yesterday, the domestic sales of red and green tea by shops and dealers on this street and in Suzhou and Wuxi continued uninterrupted, and the trend was similar to the previous day, with supply meeting demand. As for the foreign trading tea market, this year's Keemun black tea, after Jardine Matheson, Ewo, and Wing On began to actively engage in activities, the purchases of the Afternoon Tea Leaf Company have also been reignited, so the process is like a fish finding water. Unfortunately, due to the scarcity of goods, holders of goods were very aggressive in selling, resulting in transactions remaining weak. In terms of prices, they repeatedly showed strength. As for Tunlv dabang and other teas, although buying interest among exporters was good, the negotiations between the two sides were far apart, so there were only asking prices and no sales. Based on the current situation, the market is still considered firm and stable.

### Registration of British Pounds and Rupees; National Bank Extends Deadline by One Month

The government has not yet negotiated successfully with the British government regarding British pounds and rupees, and the exchange of these currencies remains suspended.

### Ratio for Bartering Cloth for Cotton Between China and Pakistan Agreed Upon by Both Parties

Pakistan's cotton production this year is quite abundant, and our government, in order to meet the country's urgent need for cotton, has been purchasing as much as possible from the United States and domestically. It has also formulated a plan to exchange a certain amount of cloth for 200,000 bales of cotton.

In addition, Pakistan's special representative, Qilaiqi, recently flew to Shanghai to investigate the production and sales conditions of our cotton textile industry and silk weaving industry. At the same time, he visited the Yarn Control Committee, the Transportation Control Committee, and other relevant agencies related to textiles to discuss matters related to the future exchange of cotton for cloth between the two countries. Over the past few days, all parties have thoroughly studied this issue, and it is reported that an agreement has been reached in principle.

In addition, the Netherlands Indies recently offered to exchange a batch of rubber worth only about ten million US dollars for our cloth. The two countries have technically agreed, but due to quota restrictions, it must await approval from the Executive Yuan before it can proceed. Our business investigation delegation to India is scheduled to depart for the Netherlands Indies the day after tomorrow to discuss the actual issues related to the exchange.

### Cotton Market Transactions Scarce

Transactions in raw cotton remain scarce, and sentiment is very weak. Coarse and fine yarns have not yet been traded. Zhoupu seed cotton remains at 32 to 33 yuan.

### Yarn Merchants Citywide Have More Than 7,500 Pieces of Yarn in Stock

Yesterday, Chairman Tang of the Yarn Industry Association visited Supervisor Jiang and reported that the yarn shops in the city had registered a total of 7,594 pieces of yarn in stock (including yarn in warehouses, uncollected factory receipts, and yarn in boxes). However, it is claimed that state-owned and privately-owned yarn factories supplied only a little over 8,000 pieces in September, while yarn shops in the city sold over 12,000 pieces, creating an imbalance between supply and demand. Therefore, he urged Supervisor Jiang to order the Central Trust Bureau and other entities to release yarn to increase supply and meet demand.

### Rayon Market Firm and Brisk

Transactions in rayon remained extremely scarce yesterday. Silk weaving businesses on this street occasionally turned firm, and the market was firm and brisk. The association's daily allocation still feels like supply cannot meet demand.
