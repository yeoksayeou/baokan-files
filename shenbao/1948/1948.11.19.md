### Xu Zhou Campaign, National Army Achieves Complete Victory: Southern Front Scores Another Victory, Bandit Army Suffers Total Collapse; Over 200,000 Bandits Annihilated in Little Over a Week

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Xu Zhou Office, 18th] The Xu Zhou Campaign involved a total of over 1.2 million troops from both sides. After 14 days of fierce and tragic fighting, it concluded at 2:00 AM on the 18th. The National Army achieved a decisive victory, and the battle has now entered the pursuit phase. The bandit army, gathering over 500,000 of its main forces south of the Yellow River, was commanded by Zhu and Mao, with Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng personally directing the front lines, launching an all-out invasion with the intent to capture Xu Zhou and then directly seize Nanjing and Shanghai. Now, facing this devastating defeat, the bandit's conspiracy has been completely shattered. According to preliminary estimates, the bandit army has suffered over 200,000 casualties. The Central Plains area south of the Yellow River can soon return to its former state, and millions of displaced compatriots will soon be able to return to their hometowns.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Xu Zhou Office, 18th] The bandits on the eastern flank suffered a complete collapse on the 18th, and the Huang Baitao, Li Mi, and Qiu Qingquan corps are now fully engaged in pursuing the fleeing bandits eastward and northward towards the Grand Canal and the Bulao River.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Xu Zhou Office, 18th] The bandits on the southern front, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng, gathered their 2nd, 4th, 11th, 12th, and southern Shandong units, totaling over 100,000 troops, and launched a fierce attack southward towards Pantang Township, 16 kilometers southeast of the city, throughout the night of the 17th. They were surrounded and intercepted by the National Army's Qiu corps. By 4:00 AM on the 18th, the bandits had suffered over 20,000 casualties and were in full retreat. The captured war materials were piled up like mountains, and a large number of remaining bandits collectively surrendered.

[Urgent Telegram from the Central News Agency, Xu Zhou, 6:00 AM, 18th] The main battle on the southern route of Xu Zhou formally commenced on the evening of the 17th. The National Army's Qiu Qingquan corps clashed with over 100,000 bandits. The air force, tanks, and artillery were all deployed to assist in the battle. After a night of fierce fighting, the bandits retreated entirely at 4:00 AM this morning. The National Army killed over 20,000 bandits, and a large number of bandits attempting to retreat collectively laid down their weapons and surrendered, setting an unprecedented example since the start of the suppression of the rebellion. The Xu Zhou Pacification Headquarters issued a special public announcement regarding this at 6:00 AM on the 18th.

[Telegram from the Central News Agency, Xu Zhou, 12:00 PM, 18th] While the main battle in southeastern Xu Zhou was underway last night, another part of Chen and Liu's bandit army, approaching the southwestern outskirts of Xu Zhou, also launched a diversionary attack on us. After a head-on blow by the Sun corps, they also suffered defeat and retreated this morning. However, a portion of the remaining bandits are surrounded and unable to escape, still putting up disorganized resistance, and the National Army is using a combined force of infantry, artillery, and air power to resolve the situation.

[Another Telegram] After the National Army defeated the main force of the bandits on the southern route of Xu Zhou, it cooperated with the air force to conduct extensive mopping-up operations. By evening, there were no traces of bandits within 40 li south of Xu Zhou. The remaining bandits had retreated in defeat towards Suqian and Xiaoxian. The remaining bandits north of Suxian have also fled in panic upon hearing the news.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Xu Zhou Office, 18th] The remnants of Chen's bandit forces, surrounded and severely attacked by the National Army in southeastern Xu Zhou, ran out of food and ammunition on the 18th, and were exhausted from hunger and fatigue. Simultaneously, inspired by our aerial leaflets and battlefield appeals, over 8,000 people gathered at 2:00 PM and collectively surrendered with their weapons.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Xu Zhou Office, 18th] Upon learning of the total collapse of the bandits and the great victory of the National Army, the citizens of Xu city gathered in the streets, excitedly telling each other, "We have won another great victory!" They spontaneously formed marching groups, overjoyed and ecstatic, setting off firecrackers to celebrate. All newspapers published extra editions.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Bengbu Office, 18th] Large armies are converging in northern Anhui. The Huang Wei corps of the National Army, advancing eastward from southern Henan, reached Mengcheng on the 17th. Li Yannian, stationed here, is also actively organizing a powerful corps. There are still large armies waiting to be transported north from Pukou. (Other battlefront news on page 2)

### Review of the Xu Zhou Campaign After One Week

[Telegram from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Ministry of National Defense issued the following general review of the Xu Zhou Campaign over the past week on the 18th:

(1) Bandit Forces Mobilized

Since Chen Yi's bandit forces succeeded through opportunistic tactics in Jinan, Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's bandits also sought to imitate this method by taking risks and moving south, coordinating with their campaign of rumors and urgently attempting to invade Xu Zhou. Because the National Army was aware of the bandit's conspiracy early on, it transferred its forces from points and lines that had lost their war value to areas where a decisive battle was expected, in order to lure the bandits into a trap for annihilation. However, regrettably, only the main force of Chen Yi's bandit army was lured into the pocket east of Xu Zhou. Only when Huang Baitao's corps participated in the battle did the victorious situation become clear. The bandit forces, seeing that our army's eastern advance by the Qiu and Li corps was putting pressure on their flanks and backs, and coupled with heavy casualties, their formation faltered and collapsed, causing Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's bandits, who were supposed to reinforce Chen Yi, to flee before they could be fully lured into the pocket. Although the National Army only intercepted the tail end of Liu's bandit forces, it was still sufficient to demonstrate the bandits' fear.

In this campaign, the bandits concentrated the forces of Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng, totaling fifteen columns. In addition, they added local bandits such as Wei Fenglou, Zhang Guangzhong, and Jin Shaoshan, as well as units from Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui, bringing the total to over 300,000. The National Army used only one corps of 100,000 men on the front line. In addition, only 400,000 men were prepared to encircle and annihilate the bandits. Bandit leader Mao Zedong originally ordered Liu Bocheng to command Chen Yi and Chen Geng's bandit forces, but Chen Yi collapsed first, and Liu's bandit forces also fled in defeat. This cannot but be said to be a case of "not fully showing their strength" for the long-prepared and heroic National Army.

(2) Course of the Xu Zhou Campaign

Chen's bandit forces were quite arrogant when moving from southern Shandong. He concentrated nine columns and four brigades, about 180,000 men, and attacked Huang's corps on our eastern flank, along the Nianzhuang and Bayiji line, dreaming of coordinating with Liu's bandit forces, who were raiding Huangkou on the western route. Only after achieving success on both the east and west flanks would he concentrate on attacking Xu Zhou. Unexpectedly, Huang's corps fought valiantly, and the bandits not only failed to complete the encirclement of Huang's corps, but were also firmly held in place, unable to advance or retreat. The battle began on the 9th, and the bandits repeatedly advanced and were repeatedly defeated. At the same time, the three columns that detoured to the south of Nianzhuang were heavily bombed day and night by our air force on the 11th and 12th, suffering over 20,000 casualties. The part that fled westward, as well as the bandit forces of Liu who came to support from the west of the Jinpu line, were intercepted by our Qiu and Li corps and cut into two sections, and isolated in the areas of Daxujia, Huangji, Damiao, Jiawang, and the Luan Shishan (Chaotic Stone Mountain) south of Xu Zhou, and west of Huanglongshan (Yellow Dragon Mountain), retreating step by step and heavily surrounded. Liu Bocheng's disruptive actions on the line from Sanbu in southern Xu to Suxian were also similarly suppressed by the strong attack of our army. The bloody battle continued until the evening of the 15th, when the bandits, having suffered over 120,000 casualties, had to begin a general retreat on both the east and west lines.

(3) Reasons for the Bandit Army's Miserable Defeat

This time, the National Army's strategy was to concentrate strong forces and annihilate the main force of the bandits. Its effect was like pulling back a fist first, and then punching out with force, making the power extra strong. Therefore, in several skirmishes, the National Army took the initiative to conduct strategic withdrawals. In this way, the National Army's strength was concentrated, while the bandits became more weak internally and loose externally. The bandits' rash advance inadvertently took the bait of the fishing tactic. In addition, this time they launched an all-out invasion, coming from afar and exhausted, forcing good people to their deaths. As long as the good people under the bandits' control had the opportunity to approach the National Army, they would take out their certificates of self-renewal and run over. What was most unexpected for the bandits was that in this battle, both the timing and the terrain were particularly unfavorable to them. The bandits feared the power of our air force. They often used nighttime to fight, but unexpectedly, every night this week was filled with clear light, the moon hanging like a mirror, making nighttime exactly like daytime. Therefore, the activity of our air force was not restricted at all. At the same time, the plains and hills around Xu Zhou were all good positions for the National Army. The bandits' defensive works could not be concealed, so they had to endure the fierce bombing from our land and air forces, resulting in extremely heavy casualties. This was also a major reason for the bandit army's miserable defeat.

(4) Statistics on Bandit Army Casualties

According to preliminary estimates, the bandit army's casualties in this battle were greater than in any previous battle. In the face of our Huang corps alone, over 63,000 bandits were killed, wounded, and captured. In addition, in the battle of Hanzhuang, we killed 4,000 bandits; in the battle of Huangkou, we killed and wounded over 7,000 bandits; in the battle of Yaowan in northern Jiangsu, we also killed and wounded over 5,000 bandits. In the Damiao area south of the eastern flank, the Qiu and Li corps killed, wounded, and captured over 10,000 bandits. The Qiu and Sun corps annihilated a total of over 10,000 troops from the 3rd and 8th corps of Chen Yi's bandits, and the various Guangxi corps, and the 4th, 9th, and 10th corps of Liu Bocheng's bandits on the two wings and the southern front. The air force bombed in shifts for days, killing approximately 30,000 bandits. Therefore, the number of bandits killed and wounded is around 130,000. The entire result of the battle is still being cleared up, while our army's total casualties were only over 40,000, a ratio of one to four between us and the bandits.

(5) Directions of the Bandit Army's Escape

As of the 17th, most of the bandits on the eastern flank were fleeing northeast towards Pixian and Tancheng. Our army is fiercely pursuing the fleeing bandits in the vicinity of Pao Che, Guanhu, and Xin'an. Many are surrendering to us. At the same time, our air force is strictly blockading the ferry crossings of the Grand Canal. Some of the bandits, having no choice, are taking the road south to escape. The bandit forces on the northern front are fleeing in defeat in the Hanzhuang and Weishan Lake areas. Our air force has flown over various places, dropping large numbers of leaflets and certificates of self-renewal, extensively issuing appeals for surrender and amnesty to rescue the good people who have been coerced by the bandits. As for the local bandits and the 3rd corps of Liu Bocheng who are harassing the Fuziji, Jiagou, and Suxian areas, they have left the railway and are retreating westward towards the Woyang and Mengxian areas.

### The President Awards Medals of Honor to Qiu Qingquan

And Gives a Reward of 200,000

[Telegram from the Central News Agency, Xu Zhou, 18th] Commander Qiu Qingquan has defeated the main force of the bandits in southeastern Xu Zhou today, completing the complete victory of the Xu Zhou Campaign. He has been awarded a Blue Sky White Sun Medal of Honor by the President, with a reward of 200,000 yuan. In addition, Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi has issued a bonus of one million yuan to reward all the officers and soldiers who participated in the Xu Zhou Campaign.

### Meeting General Qiu Qingquan Below Lintong Mountain on the Xu Zhou Frontline: Bandit Corpses Litter the Battlefield, Bloodstains Unfaded

[Telegram from the Central News Agency, Xu Zhou, 18th] On the afternoon of the 18th, this reporter traveled on a military vehicle of the Xu Zhou Pacification Headquarters to inspect the front line in Pantang Township. Below Lintong Mountain, 25 li southeast of Xu Zhou, I met General Qiu Qingquan, commander of the ever-victorious Qiu Qingquan corps. Although Mr. Qiu had not slept all night, he still appeared relaxed and happy. He spoke about the battle situation last night, saying: "In the area 25 li east and west centered on Pantang Township, the bandits actually used 150,000 troops to launch a full-scale attack, even using one column to attack a small village. It is speculated that the bandit's original intention was to break through the defense line of this corps in one fell swoop, capture the Xu Zhou airfield, and threaten the urban area of Xu Zhou. Unexpectedly, in the twelve-hour battle, they suffered 20,000 casualties, leaving corpses littering the field and retreating in a panic." Mr. Qiu also said: "Because the bandits failed in one attack, they have retreated towards Suqian along the old Yellow River siltation channel. However, the rearguard covering force, because our army is tracking and pursuing them, cannot leave the battlefield and is still putting up a final resistance in several villages south of Pantang Township." The reporter then left Mr. Qiu's headquarters and went to Jianglou, south of Pantang Township, to commemorate the battlefield achievements where smoke and fire were everywhere and fresh blood was unfaded. Corps Commander Qiu Qunda personally guided the inspection of the area of fierce fighting last night. Bandit corpses could be seen lying on the ground everywhere, upside down in the ditches, in various shapes and colors, too tragic to bear. Because the soldiers were busy building fortifications and the villagers had all fled, no one buried them. The village of Jianglou, with about four or five thousand households, has no complete houses left after this battle. While the reporter was inspecting the battlefield, the battle was still raging 5 li to the south. Two planes soared in the blue sky, diving and strafing, and the field artillery in the rear was also carrying out suppression fire. The sound of gunfire in the front could not only be heard clearly, but also seemed to be close at hand, as our pursuing troops were attacking the remnants of the bandits who were covering their retreat.

Mr. Chen Bulei's Revered Letter to the President (Photo by Central News Agency)

### Twenty Years of Devotion and Dedication: Chen Bulei Repays the Nation with Death; Report on the Circumstances of His Death Submitted to the Provisional Central Standing Committee by the Funeral Committee; Will Sent to the Party History Compilation Committee for Compilation and Storage

[Telegram from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the circumstances of Mr. Chen Bulei's death, the Funeral Committee of Committee Member Chen submitted a report at the meeting of the Provisional Central Standing Committee at 8:00 PM on the 17th: Mr. Bulei had long suffered from neurasthenia, which often caused him to suffer from insomnia. He had to take three sleeping pills every night to fall asleep. Sometimes he would wake up in the middle of the night and take several more pills to get some sleep. He always woke up around 7:00 AM. On the 13th of this month, he had not been seen rising by 10:00 AM. Secretary Jiang Junzhang pushed open the door to his bedroom and saw that Mr. Bulei's complexion was unusual. He urgently requested Dr. Chen Guangyu and Dr. Xiong Wan, medical officers of the Presidential Office, to provide treatment. The two doctors determined that Mr. Bulei had taken an overdose of sleeping pills and that his heart had stopped beating two hours earlier. At that time, Secretary Jiang found a will beside Mr. Bulei's pillow, instructing him not to call for medical treatment and to carefully release the news, so as not to allow the reactionaries to fabricate rumors because of this incident. Secretary Jiang immediately obeyed the instructions and announced that Mr. Bulei had died of insomnia and heart failure. The Chen family and his secretaries and followers sorted through his belongings and found two letters to the President and letters to his friends Zhang Daofan, Hong Lanyou, Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Chen Fang, Li Weiguo, and Tao Xisheng in his briefcase, as well as letters to his wife and son, which were all submitted separately and successively, and then forwarded by the people to the Chen Committee Member Funeral Committee. On the 15th, Chen's handwritten "Miscellany" from the 11th was also discovered and presented to the President for review. The President was deeply shocked by Mr. Bulei's twenty years of devotion and dedication, and by his ultimate act of gratitude and self-sacrifice to repay the nation. He immediately ordered that the will be sent to the Funeral Committee for photographing, printing, and publishing, and ordered that the original be returned to the family for safekeeping. The Chen Committee Member Funeral Committee compiled the various documents and sent them to the Central News Agency for publication, and submitted a report to the Central Standing Committee. When listening to the report, the Central Standing Committee was overwhelmed with grief at Mr. Bulei's words "the lamp burns low when the oil runs out." Mr. Bulei's last words, hoping that his comrades in the Party would unite and intensify their struggle, inspired the comrades. His love for the President, his sincerity to his friends, his deep concern for his wife, his deep affection for his brothers, his ardent instruction for his son, and his careful handling of public and private affairs after his death can all be seen in the various letters. Mr. Bulei's death is an extraordinary event in the history of the revolution since the martyrdom of Chen Tianhua, who threw himself into the sea. It is of great significance in promoting the unity of the Party's comrades and the revival of the National Revolution. The President and the Central Standing Committee believe that Mr. Chen's will is a valuable document in the history of the revolution and decided to send it to the Party History Materials Compilation Committee for compilation and storage, to shine together with the "Tianhua Collection" and become immortal. (The late Committee Member Chen's will, "Letter to the President and Miscellany," published on page 2)

### The President Personally Leads All Executive and Supervisory Committee Members in Holding a Public Memorial Ceremony in Nanjing; Hong Lanyou and Chen Xizeng Escort the Coffin on a Special Train to Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Nanjing Office, 18th] The coffin of Mr. Chen Bulei, National Policy Advisor to the Presidential Office, was sent off in Nanjing on the 18th, and immediately transported by train from Nanjing to Shanghai, then to Hangzhou, where it will be buried on a selected date. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 18th, the central government and various circles in the capital held public memorial ceremonies separately. In the Chongjing Hall of the China Funeral Home, funeral music played, mourners gathered, and the scene was extremely solemn. At 9:00, the President led all members of the KMT Executive and Supervisory Committees in holding a memorial ceremony. The President wore mourning clothes, and his face showed grief. When he withdrew after the ceremony, his eyes were moist, and his deep grief for Mr. Chen was evident. Following this, public memorial services were held by the Presidential Office, the Capital Press Association, the Central Political Committee, and the Central Daily News, with Wu Dingchang, Chen Bosheng, Hong Lanyou, and Ma Xingye presiding over the ceremonies. At 10:00, Li Wenfan was the official who inscribed the spirit tablet, and Di Jiliang and Hong Lanyou were the assistant officials for the inscription, and the ceremony was extremely grand. At 12:00, the coffin was lifted, and after the funeral music was played, Chen Lifu presided over the ceremony, with Chen Fang, Zhang Lisheng, Zhu Jiahua, and Zhang Daofan as accompanying officials. After the ceremony, the filial sons respectfully welcomed the coffin onto the hearse. The funeral procession was led by a police escort car, followed by a band car, then a portrait car, a spirit tablet car, a filial son car, a hearse, and finally family cars, marriage relatives cars, guest cars, and funeral committee cars. At one time, plain cars and white horses slowly moved, about half a mile long. The News Bureau and other agencies held roadside memorial services along the way. At 1:00 PM, it arrived at the Hepingmen Station. After the coffin was moved onto the special train, another memorial ceremony was held, presided over by Yu Youren. The departure time of the special train, after the funeral committee Chen Xizeng contacted the Railway Bureau, was scheduled to depart at 2:00 PM, but it was delayed for a long time due to the Railway Bureau's lack of preparation. Mourners such as Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, and Wu Tiecheng were waiting next to the station. It was not until 2:30 PM that the locomotive was dispatched, and it departed at 2:50 PM, after which his friends returned to the city one after another. Chen's family and members of the funeral committee, Hong Lanyou and Chen Xizeng, escorted the hearse to Hangzhou. Mr. Hong said that the matters such as surveying the cemetery in Hangzhou will be discussed and decided with Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, and the burial and other issues will be presided over by Mayor Zhou. (News of the hearse along the way and arrival in Shanghai published on page 4)

### Summoning the Chen Family and Expressing Concern for Their Livelihood

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Nanjing Office, 18th] President Chiang expressed great concern for the family of Mr. Chen Bulei. On the 18th, after going to the China Funeral Home to preside over the public memorial service, he summoned the family of Mr. Chen at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 10:30 AM, expressing his concern and condolences. The family of Mr. Chen who went to visit included Mrs. Chen Wang Yunmo, sons Mai and Sui, daughters Xiu and Lian, and younger brothers Xun Ci, Xun Yu, and Xun Yuan, totaling eight people. The President and his wife personally received them. The President first said: Chen's death is a great loss to the country and to him personally, and he hoped that his children could inherit his legacy. The President shed tears during the conversation. The President repeatedly expressed his concern for the future life of Chen's family, inquired about them individually, and said that if there were any difficulties, he would do his best to solve them. He also inquired about Chen's cemetery. Mrs. Chen told him that Mr. Chen had purchased a piece of land near Fanzhuang near the Dahe Pagoda in Hangzhou during his lifetime, originally planning to build a residence to prepare for his old age, and now it will be used as his cemetery. The President expressed satisfaction with this location and hoped that he would be buried soon. Mrs. Chen then thanked the President. The President's wife also spoke with Mrs. Chen, encouraging her to accept the change and restrain her grief. They left at 11:00 AM. After Mrs. Chen returned to the funeral home, she took care of the funeral arrangements, and said firmly: She will inherit Chen's legacy and work hard for the country. As for the questions about her livelihood from all sides, because Chen's life was extremely frugal, she will be even more frugal in the future. Mrs. Chen felt that the funeral ceremony was already too extravagant. Mrs. Chen is fifty-seven years old this year, two years younger than Mr. Chen. She has never been separated from him for a long period of time since their marriage twenty-eight years ago. Now that Mr. Chen has passed away, in addition to grief, his wife still prioritizes inheriting his legacy, accepting the change and restraining her grief, and personally handling the funeral arrangements, which is truly commendable, and has won the praise of relatives and friends.

The public memorial service for the late Committee Member Chen Bulei was held at 9:00 AM on the 18th at the China Funeral Home in Nanjing. President Chiang personally presided over the ceremony, with Yu Youren, He Yingqin, and Li Zongren as accompanying officials. (Photo by Central News Agency)

### President Chiang's Eulogy to Chen Bulei

[Telegram from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] President Chiang's eulogy to Mr. Chen Bulei is as follows:

On this eighteenth day of November in the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, Chiang Chung-cheng, President of the Chinese Kuomintang, leads all members of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and respectfully offers incense, flowers, and pure libations as a ceremony to mourn the spirit of the late Standing Committee Member Chen Bulei, and to say:

A sudden whirlwind rolls, severe frost falls, O noble Mr. Chen, forever at peace, With literary prowess since youth,

Establishing sincerity and rejecting the corrupted, Sincere loyalty and love, The sentiment is seen in his words, Dedicating himself to the revolution, Holding fast to the Three Principles of the People,

A hundred thousand teachers were surpassed by his writing, In the past, during the years of hardship, he rectified the diction, Announcing to all sides,

Thus laying the foundation for the nation, The nation is revived through hardship, The pivot of the government relies on him, Consulting and deliberating everywhere, Neither dissenting nor complying,

Not saying that talent is lacking, You are the model of our party, How can you suddenly close your eyes, The departed passes like this, Looking at your portrait,

A crane-like posture, Regretting your early death, Why is it not my personal grief, The front army announced victory, Its great prestige,

Your soul is in agony, Suddenly descending here, Accept this offering.

美海軍陸戰隊千餘名　由關島增援靑島
More Than a Thousand U.S. Marines Reinforce Qingdao from Guam

羅維特證實蔣總統致函杜魯門
Lovett Confirms President Chiang Sent Letter to Truman

〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕美海軍部十七日命令一，二五〇名海軍陸戰隊員由關島援靑島美駐軍，并協助撤退美僑。同時宜布運輸艦兩艘赴滬，另一艘赴靑，以撤退四千六百左右美人。國防部長福萊斯特在記者招待會中最先發表增援青島命令。渠稱：一千五百名海軍陸戰隊早已在赴靑島途中·福氏繼稱：派遣更多軍隊至華北之決定係與國務院磋商而定者。福氏與國務院均不說明靑島如遭共軍進攻，海軍陸戰隊將否抵抗或撤退，國務院發言人稱：「此點全視情形而定·現無答覆可言。」派遣海軍陸戰隊事，一般認爲此乃對中共領袖之警吿，卽美國決保護在該戰區內之美人生命與權益。
[United Press, Washington, 17th] The U.S. Navy Department ordered on the 17th that 1,250 Marines be sent from Guam to reinforce the U.S. garrison in Qingdao and to assist in the evacuation of American citizens. At the same time, it was announced that two transport ships would go to Shanghai and another to Qingdao to evacuate approximately 4,600 Americans. Secretary of Defense Forrestal first announced the order to reinforce Qingdao at a press conference. He said: "1,500 Marines are already en route to Qingdao." Forrestal continued: "The decision to send more troops to North China was made in consultation with the State Department." Forrestal and the State Department did not specify whether the Marines would resist or withdraw if Qingdao were attacked by Communist troops. A State Department spokesman said: "This depends entirely on the situation. There is no answer at present." The dispatch of Marines is generally seen as a warning to the Chinese Communist leaders that the United States is determined to protect the lives and interests of Americans in the war zone.

羅維特對於該函拒絕評論，渠指出，此函牽涉兩國元首間之換文，發表與否，將由蔣總統決定之。杜魯門總統星期二在佛羅里達州之基威斯透露：美政府與蔣總統保持接觸，但渠並不說明詳情。
Lovett declined to comment on the letter, pointing out that it involved an exchange of letters between the heads of state of the two countries, and the decision to publish it would be made by President Chiang. President Truman revealed on Tuesday in Key West, Florida, that the U.S. government was in contact with President Chiang, but he did not elaborate.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese mission to the United States, announced today that the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) is accelerating the shipment of rice, wheat, and other necessary items to China. Bei emphasized that in order to accelerate the ECA's shipment of materials to China, the congestion of pre-booked transportation space must be eliminated. He declined to comment on reports from Nanjing quoting Foreign Minister Wang Shijie as saying that Bei was negotiating for "more aid." At the same time, it was learned from well-informed sources that four U.S. Navy ships, each carrying 9,000 tons of wheat originally purchased for the U.S. forces stationed in Japan, had been rerouted to China and had already departed from the U.S. West Coast. Although ECA officials politely declined to confirm the shipment, they explained that after discussions with the Army, approximately two or three shiploads of wheat originally purchased by the Department of Agriculture for the U.S. forces stationed in Japan had been transferred to the ECA for shipment to China. This batch of supplies is currently being loaded at several ports in Washington State (where dockworkers have not gone on strike) for shipment to China. According to the ECA, approximately eleven shipments of wheat, weighing about 100,000 tons, are scheduled to be shipped from ports in Washington State to China from November 1st to the end of the year.

陳布雷先生雜記遺蹟之一（中央社報）陳布雷先生遺書（一）
Mr. Chen Bulei's Miscellaneous Notes, One of the Remains (Central News Agency Report) Mr. Chen Bulei's Last Will and Testament (I)

上總裁書
Letter to the President

（一）介公總裁鈞　：布雷追隨二十年，受知深切，任何痛苦均應承當，以期無負敎誨。但今春以來，目覩耳聞，飽受刺激，入夏秋後，病象日增，神經極度衰弱，實已不堪勉强支持。値此黨國最艱危之時期，而自騐近來身心，已無絲毫可以效命之能力，與其偸生尸位，使公誤計以爲尙有一可供驅使之部下因而貽誤公務，何如坦白承認自身已無能爲役，而結束其毫無價値之一生。凡此狂愚之思想，純屬心理之失常。讀公昔在黄埔斥責自目殺之訓詞深感此舉爲萬萬無可諒恕之罪惡，實無面目再求宥諒。縱有百功，亦不能掩此一　。况自問生平實無絲毫貢獻可言乎？天佑中國，必能轉危爲安，惟公善葆政躬，頤養天和，以保陣三民主義之成功，而庇議我四億五千萬之同胞。回憶許身麾下，本置生死於度外，豈料今日乃以畢生盡瘁之初衷，而蹈此極不負責之結局，書生無用，負國負公，眞不知何詞以自解也？夫人前並致敬意，部屬布　負罪謹上。
(1) To President Chiang Kai-shek: I, Bulei, have followed you for twenty years and am deeply grateful for your understanding. I should bear any pain to live up to your teachings. However, since the spring, I have been greatly stimulated by what I have seen and heard. Since summer and autumn, my illness has worsened. My nerves are extremely weak, and I can no longer force myself to endure it. At this most difficult time for the party and the country, I realize that I no longer have the ability to serve. Rather than living a life of idleness and causing you to mistakenly believe that there is still a subordinate who can be used, thus delaying public affairs, it is better to frankly admit that I am no longer able to serve and end my worthless life. All these crazy and foolish thoughts are purely due to psychological abnormalities. Having read your admonition at Huangpu scolding those who commit suicide, I deeply feel that this act is an unforgivable sin, and I have no face to seek forgiveness again. Even if I have a hundred merits, they cannot cover this one crime. Moreover, I ask myself, have I really made any contribution in my life? May God bless China and turn danger into safety. I hope that you will take care of yourself and maintain your health in order to ensure the success of the Three Principles of the People and protect our 450 million compatriots. Recalling when I devoted myself to your command, I originally placed life and death aside. How could I have imagined that today, with my initial intention to devote my life, I would fall into this extremely irresponsible ending? I, a useless scholar, have failed the country and failed you. I really do not know how to explain myself. I also send my respects to your wife. Your subordinate, Bulei, humbly submits this with guilt.

（二）介公再鑒：當此前方捷報頻傳，後方秩序漸穩之時，而布雷乃忽得狂病以至不起，不能分公憂勞，反貽公以激刺，實萬萬無飼以自解！然布雷此意早動於數年之前，而最近亦起於七八月之間，常誦「瓶之傾兮惟　之恥」之句，抑抑不可終日。黨國艱危至此，賤體乃久久不能自振，年迫衰暮，無補危時。韓愈有言：「中朝大官老於事詎知感激徒姘婀」布雷自問良知，實覺此時不應無感激輕生之士，而此身已非自效危艱之身，長日回皇，慚憤無地。昔者，公聞葉舉詆總理之言而置箸不食，今我所聞所見，於一般老百姓之中毒素宣傳，以散播關於公之謠言誣蔑者，不知凡幾。回憶在渝，當三十二年時，公卽命注意敵人之反宣傳，而四五年來，布雷實毫未盡力以挽回此惡毒之宣傳，卽此一端，又萬萬無可自恕自全之理！我心純潔質直，除忠於我公之外，毫無其他私念，今乃以無地自容之侮疾，出於此無可諒恕之結局，實出於心理狂　之萬不得已·敢再爲公陳之。
(2) Again, to President Chiang Kai-shek: At a time when good news is frequently reported from the front and order is gradually stabilizing in the rear, I, Bulei, have suddenly fallen ill and cannot recover. I cannot share your worries and instead cause you stimulation. I really cannot explain myself! However, this intention of mine has been brewing for several years, and recently it has arisen again between July and August. I often recite the phrase "The shame of a overturned bottle lies solely with the bung," and I am depressed all day long. The party and the country are in such a difficult situation, but my humble body has been unable to recover for a long time. I am nearing old age and cannot help in this time of crisis. Han Yu said, "High officials in the court grow old in their careers, how can they know the gratitude of those who merely flatter?" I, Bulei, ask my conscience and truly feel that at this time there should be no one who is ungrateful and takes his life lightly. But this body of mine is no longer fit to serve in times of danger. Long days pass in unease, and I am ashamed and resentful. In the past, you stopped eating when you heard Ye Ju defame Premier Sun Yat-sen. Now, what I have heard and seen is that among the common people, there is poisonous propaganda spreading rumors and slanders about you, I do not know how many. I recall that in Chongqing in 1943, you ordered me to pay attention to enemy counter-propaganda. But in the past four or five years, I have not made any effort to reverse this malicious propaganda. For this reason alone, there is no way for me to forgive myself and preserve my integrity! My heart is pure and honest. Apart from being loyal to you, I have no other selfish thoughts. Now, with the shame of having no place to hide, I am driven to this unforgivable ending. It is truly out of the psychological madness that I have no choice. I dare to present this to you again.

十一月十一日雜記
Miscellaneous Notes of November 11th

人生總有一死，死有重於泰山，有輕於鴻毛。
Everyone will die eventually. Some deaths are heavier than Mount Tai, while others are lighter than a feather.

倘使我是在抗戰中因工作關係，（如某年之七月六日以及在長江舟中）被敵機掃射轟炸而遇難，雖不能是重於泰山，也還有些價値。
If I were to die in the War of Resistance due to work-related reasons (such as being strafed and bombed by enemy aircraft on July 6th of a certain year and on a boat in the Yangtze River), although it would not be heavier than Mount Tai, it would still have some value.

倘使我是因工作實在緊張，積勞成疾而死，也還値得人一些些可惜。
If I were to die due to the intensity of my work and accumulated fatigue, it would still be a little bit regrettable.

而今我是爲了腦力實在用得太疲勞了，思慮一些也不能用，考慮一個問題時，終覺得頭緒紛繁，無從入手，而且拖延疲怠，日復一日，把急要的問題應該早些提出方案之交件（如戰時體制），一天天拖延下去，着急儘管着急，而一些不能主動，不但怕見統帥，甚且怕開會，自己拿不出一些此主意，可以說我的腦筋已是油盡燈枯了。爲了這一些苦憐，又想到國家已進入非常時期，　我這樣虛生人間何用？由此一念，而萌自棄之心，雖日不謂爲臨難苟免，何可得乎？
But now I am so mentally exhausted that I cannot use my mind at all. When considering a problem, I always feel overwhelmed and cannot find a starting point. Moreover, I procrastinate and become fatigued, day after day, delaying the submission of urgently needed solutions (such as the wartime system). Although I am anxious, I cannot take the initiative. I am not only afraid to see the commander, but even afraid to attend meetings because I cannot come up with any ideas. It can be said that my mind is exhausted. Because of these sufferings, and thinking that the country has entered an extraordinary period, what is the use of me living a life of futility? From this thought, I have developed a desire to abandon myself. Although I do not say that I am seeking to avoid difficulty, how can I obtain it?

所以我的死，在我自身，是不勝痛苦焦慮（所憂者，是自身委實已不能工作，而他人或尙以我有一此用處，這將要誤事的。我之所憂，並不在大局·中華民族有正義的力量，祗須大家團結，大局不足憂也）。而死，但在一般的意義上，是一種極不可恕之罪惡。
Therefore, my death, to myself, is unbearable pain and anxiety (what I worry about is that I am really unable to work, but others may still think that I am of some use, which will cause delays. What I worry about is not the overall situation. The Chinese nation has the power of justice. As long as everyone unites, there is no need to worry about the overall situation). But death, in the general sense, is an unforgivable sin.

天下最大之罪惡孰有過於「自暴自棄而自了」者？（對國家對家庭，都是不負責任的行爲。）我此舉萬萬不可爲訓。我覺得任何人都可以鄙視我·責備我。
What is the greatest sin in the world other than "abandoning oneself and taking one's own life"? (It is an irresponsible act towards the country and the family.) My actions must never be taken as an example. I feel that anyone can despise me and责备me.

但我這一個念頭，萌動了不知多少次了，。每逢心理痛苦時，常常有「終結我的生命吧」的念頭來襲余之心。此在三十一年三十二年三十四年之春之夏，均有類似的情形，並已作了種種凖備，終因健康稍稍好轉而免。
But this thought has arisen countless times. Whenever I am in psychological pain, the thought of "ending my life" often attacks my heart. This has happened in the spring and summer of 1942, 1943, and 1945, and I have made various preparations, but I was spared because my health improved slightly.

人生到了不能工作，不能用思慮，則生命便失其意義；沒有意義的生命，留之何用？
When life reaches the point where one cannot work and cannot use their mind, then life loses its meaning; what is the use of keeping a meaningless life?

現在我眞是衰老疲憊，思慮社　鈍滯到了極點了！就是一部機器，用了廿年以上，也要歸於廢舊的，何况有形的身體？
Now I am truly old and tired, and my thinking is extremely dull! Even a machine that has been used for more than twenty years will be discarded, let alone a tangible body?

最近常想國家是進入非常時期了，我　應該拿出抗戰時的精神來挽回國難，但是我自問身心較十一年以前大不相同，卽是共事的同事們，其分心經濟，精神頹散，不免影響工作，要像當年的振奮耐勞，亦不可得。而客觀形勢的要求，十倍艱難，也十倍複雜於當時。然則如我者，將何以自處？
Recently, I often think that the country has entered an extraordinary period, and I should bring out the spirit of the War of Resistance to save the country from disaster. But I ask myself, my body and mind are very different from what they were eleven years ago. Even my colleagues, who are distracted by economics and mentally depressed, inevitably affect the work. It is impossible to be as inspired and hardworking as I was back then. And the demands of the objective situation are ten times more difficult and ten times more complex than they were at that time. So how should I, as I am now, conduct myself?

某日曾與立夫（又常爲芷町或唯果）言，要使我能定心工作，必須（一）使我有好身體，（二）領袖對我（祗有幾多分量能挑起來）有大體的認識而勿高估我的精力，和抗戰時一樣。（三）如何作最後最大之努力有一個凖她，然後我這一顆心才定得下來。
One day, I said to Lifu (also known as Zhiting or Weiguo) that in order for me to work with peace of mind, I must (1) have a good body, (2) the leader must have a general understanding of my abilities (I can only shoulder a limited amount) and not overestimate my energy, as it was during the War of Resistance, (3) have a way to make a final, maximum effort, and then my heart can settle down.

但是看樣子，我的身體是無法好起來的，我此心永遠在痛苦憂急之中。
But it seems that my body will never get better, and my heart is forever in pain and anxiety.

四弟告我「百事要看得渾些」；我知其意而做不到。
My fourth younger brother told me, "You have to see everything in a more holistic way"; I know what he means, but I can't do it.

八弟吿我「一切一切自有主管，又不是你一個人着急所能濟事的」，又說「你何必把你責任範圍以外的事也要去分心思慮着急」；這話有至理，然我不能控制我的腦筋。
My eighth younger brother told me, "Everything has its own manager, and it's not something that you can solve by being anxious alone," and he also said, "Why do you have to worry about things that are outside your scope of responsibility?"; there is great truth in these words, but I cannot control my mind.

家人嘗勸我，「你這樣的衰弱情形，應該誤領袖知道你已不堪再供驅策了」，這也是不錯，但我何能在這個時候瑣瑣地去絮煩領袖呢？
My family has advised me, "With your weak condition, you should let the leader know that you can no longer be driven," which is also true, but how can I bother the leader with trivial matters at this time?

想來想去，毫無出路，覺得自身的處境與能力太不相應了，自身的個性缺點與自己之所以許身自處者太不相應了，思之思之，爲此繁憂，已廿天於茲·我今眞成了憂　狂了！憂鬱狂是足以大大發生變態的·我便爲這種變態反常的心理現象而陷於不可救，豈非天乎！
Thinking about it again and again, there is no way out. I feel that my situation and ability are too disproportionate, and my personal shortcomings are too disproportionate to the reason why I promised myself to be where I am. Thinking about it, I have been worried about this for twenty days now. I have truly become obsessed with worry! Melancholy is enough to cause great abnormalities. I am trapped by this abnormal psychological phenomenon and cannot be saved. Is it not fate?

六十老人得此極不榮譽之下塲，祗有罪愆，別無可說！
An old man of sixty has come to this extremely dishonorable end. There is only sin, and nothing else to say!

我祗有一句話奉勸各位友好與同志，乘少壯時精力旺盛時，速爲國家爲人民加緊作最大的奮鬥，莫待「老大徒傷悲」·（未完待續）
I have only one word of advice for all my friends and comrades: take advantage of your youth and vigor to work hard for the country and the people and make the greatest effort, lest you "grow old and only regret." (

### Reflections on Reading the Posthumous Writings of Mr. Chen Bulei

The devastating news of Mr. Chen Bulei's death six days ago came so suddenly, causing immense grief in all circles of Shanghai. Yesterday, a Beijing telegram described the KMT Central Standing Committee's announcement of Mr. Bulei's passing, along with his letter to the President and miscellaneous posthumous writings, which filled us with a myriad of emotions and left us unable to find solace. Today, Mr. Bulei's hearse will pass through Shanghai on its way to Hangzhou, marking a final farewell to the city where he first took up his pen to discuss politics twenty years ago. As news reporters and former colleagues of Mr. Bulei, we cannot help but restrain our sorrow and briefly express our feelings upon reading his posthumous writings.

Firstly, Mr. Chen Bulei was truly the most responsible of scholars! Mr. Bulei himself said that he "had truly become melancholic." Although he knew that "melancholy could greatly lead to mental derangement... and become incurable," and ultimately "felt compelled to end his life," his initial thought was simply that after twenty years in politics, his physical strength had "reached the end of its tether," and he could no longer serve the Party and the nation. He was extremely unwilling to harm the country's affairs with his weakened body, so he chose to repay the leader's special appreciation with his death. If he were not a scholar at heart, but a conformist official or a scheming politician, he would never have thought this way. If he were not the most responsible of scholars, he could have made grand pronouncements, feigned madness, or retired to his hometown, evaded danger, or pretended to investigate and vanished to a foreign land. There were all sorts of expedient ways to avoid death and live a life of ignominy, so why would he choose to die? The ancients said, "Scholars are good for nothing," but Mr. Chen Bulei's personality was inclined to become a model scholar who made the greatest contribution and was of the greatest use to the country. Once his physical strength was exhausted and he felt that his energy was no longer usable, he thought, "Why keep this mere body?" Isn't this the most responsible of scholars?

Secondly, Mr. Chen Bulei was truly a loyal and pure Party member! Mr. Chen Bulei was the chief editor of the *Tian Duo Bao* newspaper in his early years. Although he never joined the Tongmenghui, his advocacy of revolution surpassed that of Party members. When he became the chief editor of the *Shang Bao* in the ninth year of the Republic, the newspaper was not a Party newspaper, and he was not a Party member, but for six or seven years, his verbal and written attacks on the Northern Warlords were tantamount to being the vanguard of the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition. After the Northern Expedition began, he became a Party member, and in the remaining years of his life, as he said in his posthumous writings, he only had the thought of serving the Party and the country and being loyal to the leader. Mr. Bulei's loyalty can be seen from the fact that he was always willing to be the leader's staff and only worried about his inability to bear the burden due to his physical weakness. Mr. Bulei's purity can be seen simply from his lifelong lack of factions, ambition, and selfishness, and that his voluminous posthumous writings did not contain a single word relating to personal matters, which cannot but fill us with respect. There are millions of KMT party members; Mr. Chen Bulei should be their model. It is fitting that the President used the four characters "Perfect man of our time" to mourn him, and the President's grief at losing such a key advisor, whom he had relied on for twenty years, must be considerable.

Finally, we hope that Mr. Bulei's death will sweep away the pessimistic sentiments of those who are discouraged by failure, and strengthen the unity and struggle of Party members and the people. Mr. Bulei himself said that he was not worried about the overall situation, but about his own physical strength. He believed that China had its own history and culture, and as long as everyone was united—especially the KMT members united—China's future was bright. However, at the most critical time for the Party and the nation, his extremely exhausted mind and strength could not meet his ambitions and mission. This is what he was worried about, and this is why he became melancholic and ultimately incurable. Therefore, Mr. Bulei was by no means a defeatist. On the contrary, he had a deep conviction that China would be able to overcome this final difficulty and achieve independence and autonomy, but he greatly suffered from the fact that his physical strength could not support him. He greatly regretted not being able to witness China's unification and revival, so he did not hesitate to repay the Party and the country with his death. Party members of the KMT, compatriots of the whole country, if everyone can be inspired by Mr. Bulei's posthumous writings, muster courage, and strengthen unity to fight against the forces of corruption and evil, so that China can cross this storm and reach the bright and splendid shore, then Mr. Bulei's spirit will be immortal.

### The Situation in North China Becomes Increasingly Tense: Fierce Battles in Baoding's South Gate and East Gate; National Army Launches Attacks; The Northeast-Facing Ridge Position of Bingcheng is Lost and Regained

[Special dispatch from our Tianjin, 18th] The situation in North China is becoming increasingly tense. Judging from various signs, Tianjin will become the strongest fortress in North China. Fu Zuoyi is determined to defend it. In recent days, large armies have gathered outside Tianjin, and a new military airport has been built in the suburbs. Amid rumors that American aid is being directly transported, Mr. Fu is actively expanding his military strength and encouraging his subordinates to take the recovery of the Northeast as their own responsibility, which has greatly boosted morale.

[Special dispatch from our Beiping, 18th] News from the North China Suppression Headquarters: Fierce fighting occurred at Baoding's East Gate and South Gate on the afternoon of the 17th.
