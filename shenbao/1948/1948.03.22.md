### Hu Shih Calls Himself a Bookworm; Denies Running for Vice President

Helping the Government Does Not Necessarily Mean Becoming an Official

[This Newspaper Report] When asked by this newspaper's reporter last night, Hu Shih, the president of Peking University, solemnly denied rumors that he would participate in the government's organization. Hu stated in response to the question of expanding the government's base: The Kuomintang has traditional magnanimity. Government personnel organization has always valued talent, such as Weng Wenhao, Jiang Tingfu, Yu Dawei, Zhou Yichun and others, many of whom are members of the Independent Comment Society and have no party affiliation, but have been successively recruited by the government, just like my predecessor as ambassador to the United States, who also had no party affiliation. He believes that an independent non-partisan person can freely express opinions if they have understanding and insight. "Helping the government does not necessarily mean becoming an official," and after the implementation of the constitution, the government organization must appoint a Premier to form a cabinet after the President and Vice President are elected. It is too early to talk about reorganizing the government at this time. He then humbly stated: "I am a bookworm and cannot even manage my own affairs, let alone politics, which is everyone's business, so I will not interfere." He instructed the reporter to never believe rumors that he would join the government (see page six).

### The Central Bank First Allocates Over One Trillion Yuan: Agricultural Loans to Be Released This Month, Allocation Principles Decide to Adopt a Focus-Oriented Approach

[Report from Nanjing, 21st] After the Four Banks Joint Council determined this year's agricultural loans to be 150,000 times [the original amount], the Sino-Agricultural Bank and the Central Bank negotiated the issue of fundraising. As a result, the Central Bank has already allocated 1,475 billion yuan starting in March, which can be distributed by the Sino-Agricultural Bank to various regions for release within this month. As for the total amount of agricultural loans allocated to each province, the executive meeting of the Sino-Agricultural Bank also discussed and decided on the allocation principles, which adopt a focus-oriented approach and are coordinated with the agricultural department's production increase plan. The amounts allocated to each province vary greatly. According to Li Shuming, the general manager of the Sino-Agricultural Bank, this method is adopted in the hope that agricultural loans will truly benefit production.

[Report from Nanjing, 21st] The Sino-Agricultural Bank's executive meeting continued for four days, discussing the issue of agricultural loans and implementation methods. It concluded on the afternoon of the 21st. The meeting passed over a hundred proposals, most of which were specific implementation methods for agricultural loans, which can be implemented by various branches according to the resolutions. Li Shuming, the general manager of the bank, hosted reporters at 6 p.m. on the 21st to report on the shift in this year's agricultural loan policy. According to Li, this year's agricultural loans are closely coordinated with production, and there are five significant differences in policy compared to previous years: (1) All agricultural loan quotas and implementation methods are based on the government's established plans, especially for grain and cotton, which have been repeatedly discussed with the agricultural department to ensure coordination and focus efforts on the same goal. (2) To ensure effective production increases, a focus-oriented approach is adopted, selecting production centers to avoid dispersion and waste. (3) The entire process of agricultural production, from production, processing, manufacturing, to sales, should have a consistent set of methods to complete the task. This has been planned for a long time, and this year provides an opportunity for implementation, linking everything together to ensure a smooth process, protect farmers' interests, and facilitate the rational circulation of goods. (4) For agriculture to be modernized, it must be managed as an enterprise. Efforts have been made towards this goal for a long time, but the results have not been significant. Starting this year, it is hoped that it can be introduced into the path of enterprise management and establish its initial foundation. (5) The handling of agricultural loans is often subject to criticism, and the bank is happy to accept it and seek improvement. This year presents a good opportunity, so special attention has been paid to simplifying agricultural loan procedures and improving loan effectiveness, ensuring that farmers truly benefit and that production effects are genuinely achieved.

### New York Overseas Chinese Have Good Income, Most Remittances Escape to Hong Kong, Chen Zhonghai Discusses the Situation of Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Chen Zhonghai, a representative of overseas Chinese in the eastern United States to the National Assembly, who returned to Beijing from the United States yesterday, spoke to reporters in detail about the situation of overseas Chinese in New York. Chen graduated from Columbia University in the United States with a Ph.D. in philosophy and is currently the chairman of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of New York. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association is the highest guiding institution for overseas Chinese in New York. Chen said that the vast majority of overseas Chinese in New York support the government, love their motherland, and their only hope is that the suppression of the rebellion will be completed as soon as possible, and that China will become a strong and democratic country. The overseas Chinese there, with the exception of a few communists, deeply hate the Communist Party. Overseas Chinese are very fond of their motherland and their families, so they remit their savings back to their motherland. Recently, due to the large difference between the black market exchange rate and the official rate, they were unwilling to remit money to their motherland through national banks, so overseas Chinese remittances escaped to Hong Kong. At the same time, some overseas Chinese brought their savings of gold, silver, and assets back to their motherland, but due to the difficulties of customs inspection and even confiscation, returning overseas Chinese often suffered great losses. It is hoped that the government authorities will pay attention to this situation as soon as possible. Regarding the investment of overseas Chinese, Chen said that overseas Chinese are willing to invest all their assets in their motherland, but they hope that the motherland will first have a stable economic society and protection for investment. Chen cited an example, saying that at the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese from all over the United States were enthusiastic about investing in their motherland. Therefore, once various plans were announced, large sums of money were raised immediately. However, later, due to unstable currency values and social instability, overseas Chinese had to take a wait-and-see attitude towards investment. The economic life of overseas Chinese in New York is very good, the number of unemployed overseas Chinese is very small, and the lowest wage for work is 250 US dollars per month, in addition to food and accommodation. For example, restaurant chefs can earn 600 to 700 US dollars per month, in addition to food and accommodation provided by the store owner.

### Overseas Chinese Education Problems, Most Students Attend Foreign Schools

Most Students Attend Foreign Schools

Domestic Textbooks Are Not Practical

The seriousness of the overseas Chinese education problem in New York is also the same as in other overseas areas. There are about 30,000 to 40,000 overseas Chinese in New York City, of which women account for one-quarter and men account for three-quarters. There are 700 to 800 young children who enter school, but there is only one overseas Chinese elementary school in New York, with about 200 students. The rest of the overseas Chinese children attend local foreign schools. Chen expressed his regret that Chinese textbooks have not been specially edited to meet the needs of overseas Chinese. He said: For example, the civics textbooks in elementary schools teach elementary school students to wash their faces, brush their teeth, and change their clothes every day. Children in foreign countries know how to brush their teeth from a very young age, and what they know is even more detailed than what is in the textbooks. What's more, there is a description of Washington in the textbook. Overseas Chinese children in the United States already know about Washington and his deeds, and because of translation errors, overseas Chinese children feel disgusted when they read it. Textbooks like these cannot arouse the interest of overseas Chinese children. This is also one of the reasons for the failure of overseas Chinese education. The overseas Chinese culture in New York is the most developed in the United States. There are currently five daily newspapers (one of which is run by the Chinese Communist Party) and three weekly publications. Almost every overseas Chinese family reads newspapers.

### Ma Zhanshan's New Position, Internally Designated as Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Cavalry

[Report from Beiping, 21st] Following Zhang Zuoxiang and Wan Fulin's internal designation to take up new positions, it has been learned here that Ma Zhanshan has also been internally designated as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Cavalry. Li Zongren was ordered to solicit the opinions of the three. Ma will go to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 21st to meet with Zhang Zuoxiang before making a concrete decision. It is said that Zhang may accept the new position of Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee because Wei Lihuang is focusing on military affairs in Shenyang and has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to send personnel north to preside over Northeast political affairs. There is still something to be done in the political field. Ma Zhanshan will accept the new appointment, but is extremely concerned about the powers of this organization. Wan Fulin is quite negative about the position of Deputy Director of the Xingyuan. It is said that Zhang and Ma will go to Beijing to ask for instructions after they have decided to accept the appointment.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] General Ma Zhanshan arrived in Tianjin by car from Ping on the afternoon of the 21st.

### The United States Purchases Siamese Rice to Ship to China, Work is About to Be Completed, Australia Agrees to Sell Us 20,000 Tons of Wheat

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 21st] According to the US Information Service here, the United States' work of purchasing 30,000 tons of rice in Siam for relief to China is nearing completion. As a relief supply, nearly 20,000 tons of rice have been shipped to China, of which 4,000 tons were shipped to Shanghai and the rest to Guangzhou. The loading of the remaining 10,000 tons that have not yet been shipped is currently underway. All rice shipments are expected to be completed by the end of March. This rice purchase is part of the UNRRA's post-closure plan, which stipulates that the United States will ship food and medicine worth US$27.7 million to China for emergency relief. US Ambassador to Siam, Stanton, said when announcing the procurement agreement in January that this procurement plan is also beneficial to Siam, as Siam can obtain US$5 million in foreign exchange through this. This rice was allocated to China by the United Nations International Emergency Food Conference.

[Central News Agency, Sydney, 21st] The Australian government has agreed to sell 20,000 tons of wheat to China, but the price has not yet been determined. Three types of samples have been sent to China for selection. China originally requested to purchase 40,000 tons of wheat in Australia.

Editorial

### Implement Comprehensive Land Reform!

The Central China Pacification Conference passed the overall war plan and concluded successfully on the 20th. In addition to correcting the shortcomings of past military and political affairs, this plan stipulates that military, political, and economic matters should be given equal importance and effectively coordinated. Among them, the most noteworthy item is the implementation of the method of granting land to soldiers, stipulating that in principle, each soldier should be granted three to five mu of land, and detailed methods will be formulated separately. At the same time, the Pacification Conference also revised and passed the land disposal measures in the Pacification Zone, deciding in principle that "land in the Pacification Zone that is not self-cultivated, regardless of whether it has been illegally distributed by the Communists or not, will be allowed to retain up to five mu per family member; land exceeding this amount will be requisitioned by the government, and land-in-kind bonds will be issued and repaid within fifteen years, and the land will belong to self-cultivating farmers." However, the specific methods still need to be studied in detail by the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Land Affairs, and must complete the legislative process. Land reform in our country is not only an economic issue, but also a political issue. During this period of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, the fundamental solution of this problem is an important factor in determining China's future destiny. The China Land Reform Association recently announced its proposed "China Land Reform Plan" in Beijing to Chinese and foreign reporters for reference and adoption by the national government and the public. It can be seen that the land reform issue is really worthy of our attention at this time.

Our country has always been an agricultural country that "establishes the country through agriculture." Eighty percent of the country's population are farmers who "make a living by farming," and the issue of land distribution has become a key to governance and chaos throughout the dynasties for thousands of years, but it has never been resolved once and for all. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, saw the importance of this issue early on and listed land reform as one of the basic tasks of the revolution. Mr. Sun called out the slogan of "equal land rights" at the same time as "expelling the Tartars" during the Tongmenghui period. Later, in his lectures on the Principle of People's Livelihood, he put forward concrete and practical methods to achieve the highest ideal of "those who till the land have their own land." In the Outline of National Reconstruction, there is also Article 10: "When a county starts self-government, it must first stipulate the price of all privately owned land in the county. For those places where the landlords report the price themselves, the government will tax according to the price and can buy it back at any time according to the price. After this price reporting, if the land increases in value due to political improvement or social progress, then the benefits will be shared by the people of the county, so that the original owner cannot monopolize it." His proposal of "those who till the land have their own land" enriches the content of "equal land rights," and is the best way to solve the land problem, whether in theory or in practice. We assume that after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it showed determination and sincerity and implemented Mr. Sun's method. Then, China's rural economy would not be what it is today, and other economic construction could have laid a solid foundation long ago. However, for the past twenty years, on the one hand, due to the constant cycle of foreign troubles and internal strife, the government has not made this fundamental plan. On the other hand, because the government has always hesitated and has not made up its mind, the policies and laws promulgated regarding land have not fundamentally solved this serious problem, so that the problem has been used by the Communists as a weapon for political struggle. The government must deeply reflect on this mistake.

Looking at the policies and actions taken by the Communists on the land issue, it is clear that they have also moved from "land revolution" to "land reform." When the Kuomintang implemented the party purge in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Communist Party originally advocated "land revolution," confiscating the land of landlords by violence and distributing it to farmers. Later, in the 17th year, the Communist Party announced the "Land Program," and in the 19th year, it promulgated the "Land Law" twice, and in the 20th year, it promulgated the "Land Law" for the third time. Although the content has changed, they are all a continuation of the "land revolution." It was not until the outbreak of the full-scale Anti-Japanese War on July 7th that the Communist Party issued a declaration of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on September 23rd, and solemnly declared: "Stop the policy of confiscating the land of landlords by violence." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party once again made trouble and attempted to expand its territory by force, so it restored the method of land revolution in Hebei, Shandong, and Northern Jiangsu. However, the implementation of this "land revolution" of liquidating landlords not only failed to alleviate the pain of poverty, but also deepened the bankruptcy of the countryside. At the same time, in order to deceive foreigners and make them mistakenly believe that the Communist Party is a political party that carries out land reform, it promulgated the "Land Law Outline" on October 10th last year, changing its face and falsely claiming to implement a land system of "those who till the land have their own land." Although the land private ownership system of landlords was abolished, the land private ownership system of farmers was recognized. This transformation of the Communist Party directly illustrates that the "land revolution" is not suitable for China's national conditions, and it will not work no matter what. Indirectly, it also proves that the land reform proposal advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen is the only way to solve the land problem in China. However, the land reform currently implemented by the Communist Party is not actually "those who till the land have their own land." They distribute the remaining amount of land restricted by the old landlords to each household, regardless of whether he cultivates it himself, and they also allow the land to be transferred after it is distributed. Therefore, the old landlords are liquidated and overthrown, and new landlords are naturally produced soon. This is really a way of hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat. However, we should know that the Three Principles of the People are the highest principles of all administrative policies of the National Government and the highest ideals that the National Revolution wants to achieve. The failure to truly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood is a shame for the Kuomintang! Now that the Communist Party is using Mr. Sun's land policy as a weapon for political struggle, how can the National Government not catch up quickly? The decision of this Central China Pacification Conference to revise the land disposal measures in the Pacification Zone is undoubtedly a progressive and wise measure.

At present, the areas harassed by the Communists are expanding with the development of their rebellion, and the Communists are flaunting their so-called "land reform" there. Therefore, the land struggle and the military struggle have become the two major weapons of the Communist rebellion. Therefore, the government must quickly and drastically deal with the land problem, earnestly implement Mr. Sun's teachings, implement land reform, and achieve the degree of truly "those who till the land have their own land," and then the suppression of the rebellion on the military can be optimistic. Therefore, we would also like to put forward some opinions on the land reform issue for the authorities to consider.

First, it cannot be said that the government's failure to effectively solve the land problem in our country in the past twenty years is a major failure of the Kuomintang's administration. The reason for this may be that the composition of the Kuomintang is relatively complicated, or there are large landlords with feudal forces lurking among them, obstructing the land reform. However, the Kuomintang should be a revolutionary party that implements equal land rights in its essence. The decadent forces that obstruct land reform must be eliminated. Now that the government authorities know the importance of land reform and have decided to implement it, they should adopt the attitude of "the past cannot be admonished, but the future can be pursued," catch up quickly, and quickly seek the realization of Mr. Sun's proposal for land reform. Judging from the resolutions of the Central China Pacification Conference, land reform is still limited to the Pacification Zone. However, we believe that this method of partial solutions, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, will still not solve the whole problem. The only way to do it now is to follow Mr. Sun's teachings and earnestly handle it in all parts of the country. The China Land Reform Association's proposed China Land Reform Plan can be used as a basis for national officials and the public to study and discuss. In particular, intellectuals should awaken and unite and urge the government to have a land reform method that is universally applicable throughout the country in the shortest possible time, regardless of whether it is in the north or south, or in the Pacification Zone or non-Pacification Zone, and must be earnestly handled to achieve the goals stipulated in the Principle of People's Livelihood for equal land rights. In this way, it will not only be conducive to the suppression of the rebellion, but also lay a solid foundation for national economic construction.

Second, the most thorough way to solve the land problem is to have those who till the land have their own land. But there are various ways to solve it, which are worth our study. The Communists first confiscated the land of the landlords by violence and distributed it to the farmers, but now they have changed to "distributing land equally according to population." That is just a way of "dividing land equally," and it is not a true "those who till the land have their own land." The malpractices involved are naturally numerous, and the most obvious is that it is just overthrowing the old landlords and supporting the new landlords - the landlords under the wings of the Communist Party, which is of no benefit to the poor farmers who cultivate the land themselves. What kind of method should the National Government adopt in the future to be the most thorough? The China Land Reform Association suggests that the tenant farming system should be terminated and tenants should be turned into self-cultivating farmers to achieve the goal of those who till the land have their own land. Of course, this is much better than what is forced in the Communist-controlled areas, and whether it can be adopted is really worth studying.

Third, today's rural areas, after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and two and a half years of the bandit rebellion, have long reached the brink of bankruptcy. Relying solely on the reform of "those who till the land have their own land" may still not be enough to save the poverty of the rural areas. To be honest, if the government does not find ways to take other measures to relieve the rural areas, the general poor farmers who have "no way to borrow" will not only be unable to cultivate the land they are allowed to cultivate, but will simply be unable to live. Therefore, at this time when the national government and the public are paying attention to the land reform issue, we have to appeal for the poor rural areas across the country and ask the government to make a comprehensive consideration of the policy of conscription and grain collection. At the same time, in the technology of issuing agricultural loans, it must be done in a way that loans are given to real farmers, and that they can be saved from escaping the fire and water as soon as possible.

Fourth, before land reform, it is futile to talk about improving the soil, eliminating pests, improving seeds, and mechanizing agricultural tools, as it will not solve the actual problems. However, when implementing land reform, if the technology and methods of agricultural production are not reformed at the same time, and the Chinese countryside is forever stuck in the ancient model, it will not be able to save the collapse of the rural economy.

In short, today, for the sake of the future of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, it is really urgent to implement comprehensive land reform. This resolution of the Central China Pacification Conference can be said to have scratched the itch. However, we also hope that the government must not only do passive work, thinking that land reform only needs to be done in the Pacification Zone, but must thoroughly implement comprehensive land reform.

### Developing Yinggehai Salt Fields

Wu Zhixian Completes Inspection in Hainan

[Report from Haikou, 20th] Wu Zhiwei, the special commissioner of the Liangguang Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance for developing the Yinggehai Salt Fields, returned to Guangzhou on the 19th after inspecting the Yinggehai Salt Fields in Hainan.

### Operations of China National Aviation Corporation and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Japan Are Stalled

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] The offices of the Bank of China, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and China National Aviation Corporation, which were permitted by the Allied General Headquarters to be established in Japan, are likely to remain symbolic institutions for a considerable period of time, with limited business and insufficient income to cover expenses. The failure to determine exchange rates between the Japanese yen and foreign currencies, various restrictions imposed by the Allied General Headquarters, and the scarcity of trade between China and Japan have all made it impossible for commercial institutions to develop their business. These three are currently engaged in starting work, and the first problem they encounter is housing. The personnel of the three institutions are currently staying in hotels that accommodate foreign merchants, incurring significant daily expenses. However, even if they obtain office space, they will not be able to do much work under the current circumstances. According to sources at the Bank of China, the Allied General Headquarters only permits "legal entities" (most overseas Chinese are not included) to deposit funds, and the deposits are denominated in Japanese yen.

### Guangzhou Merchant's Wife Gives Birth to a Deformed Fetus: A Two-Headed Baby Girl

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] This morning, the Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital received a two-headed baby girl during a delivery. The infant's limbs are no different from those of ordinary people. The two heads grow separately between the left and right shoulders, forming a symmetrical shape. Both have necks, and all five facial features and hair are present, but the left head is slightly smaller than the right head. According to the doctor on duty, the delivery was extremely difficult, and the baby was born after several hours of surgery, but it was already dead. The mother is still resting in the hospital. The mother is Du Zhou, 30 years old, and her husband is a merchant. When reporters arrived at the hospital, she had already instructed the hospital to decline interviews.

### "Limiting Land Rent on Agricultural Land"

Measures Awaiting Approval and Implementation by the Executive Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the implementation of rent reduction, the National Government issued an order to all provinces and cities at the time of victory to implement the "25% Rent Reduction," which stipulates that in areas where land taxes have been exempted after the victory, rent should be reduced by one-fourth at the same time. However, this "25% Rent Reduction" is limited to the year of tax exemption and is temporary in nature. As for subsequent farmland rental rates, in places where the land price has been legally stipulated, the land rent shall not exceed 8% of the land price. In places where the land price has not been legally stipulated, the land rent to be paid by tenant farmers should still be calculated temporarily according to the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 10050, which is 3.75 per thousand of the main product. Guangxi Province has formulated implementation measures for farmland rental in the province, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. According to Article 2 of the measures, "Land rent on farmland should be strictly limited in accordance with the provisions of Article 110 of the Land Law." In Hunan Province's "25% Rent Reduction," the Provincial Land Administration Bureau has, in accordance with the rent reduction principle, promulgated the "Implementation Measures for Tax Exemption and Rent Reduction in Hunan Province," ordering all cities and counties to strictly implement them. The work of tax exemption and rent reduction is still being completed in the 36th year, and the method is to reduce the original rent by one-fourth, which does not refer to the provision of "3.75 per thousand of the main product." Other provinces, such as Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Suiyuan, have also promulgated and implemented similar separate measures. In order to remedy the malpractices of implementing statutory land rent, the Ministry of Land Affairs previously formulated "Measures to Limit Land Rent on Agricultural Land" based on the economic reform plan, stipulating that farmland lease contracts must be reviewed and registered for control, so as to avoid the occurrence of the above-mentioned malpractices. The measures have been approved by the National Economic Commission and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.

### Self-Defense and Protecting the Nation

— Fang Zhi

Suppressing bandits and pacifying the country is our established national policy. In order to maintain the highest interests of the nation and the people, to protect their basic survival and the rights of democracy and freedom, and to save the suffering people in the bandit areas, the entire country has mobilized all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to fight the communists. To complete the task of suppressing bandits and pacifying the country, we must first recognize what "bandits" are. Simply put, although "bandits" are also Chinese people with yellow faces, they have lost their humanity, destroyed their conscience, are willing to sell out their motherland, harm their own brothers, destroy the lives of others, and rob others of their food and clothing to vent their bestiality. The degree of their viciousness and cruelty surpasses any historical bandit, traitor, or puppet. The military task of suppressing bandits today is to eliminate the communists who are overturning the foundations of the country and taking the lives of the people. Only in this way can the country have independence and freedom, and society can regain the hope of safety. This is an undeniable fact.

During the suppression of bandits and pacification of the country, it is necessary for the national army generals to fight valiantly and selflessly on the front lines, but it is also necessary to have sound local forces to protect the local areas because local forces are familiar with the terrain and have convenience for combat. For example, when the communists recently roamed the Nanyang, Neixiang, Xichuan, and Zhenping areas in southwestern Henan, they were bravely blocked and attacked by local militias, achieving brilliant results. The central government specially issued an order to commend them and allocated funds for rewards. This shows that the establishment of self-defense forces during the period of bandit suppression is truly urgent.

Shanghai's conscription work for this year is about to begin, and 6,000 new recruits will be enlisted. These new recruits were originally intended to be sent to the front lines, but the military service conference has passed a resolution recommending to the central government that they be trained locally to strengthen security. Because the city is an international metropolis, the center of the country's economy, industry, and commerce, its safety is crucial to the foundations of the country, and its position is extremely important. The communists harbor malicious intentions and are constantly looking for opportunities, such as the labor strikes and student unrest that have occurred in the past, as well as the roaming of Ding Xishan's bandit troops, which are all manifestations of communist conspiracies. After these 6,000 new recruits are conscripted, it has been decided that they will stay in Shanghai, be trained locally, and become a strong force to stabilize Greater Shanghai. In other words, they are to protect their hometown and guarantee their lives and property. We have seen refugees from the communist areas fleeing to Shanghai, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, living a wandering and homeless life. We have seen newspaper and magazine articles accumulating records of the communists' crimes of harming the country and the people. We have heard how many places have been devastated by the communists' burning, killing, looting, and how countless compatriots have been destroyed by the communists' struggles and liquidations. From these facts that we have heard and seen, we can know that the communists are a flood and a beast, and they are the people's moths who do all kinds of evil. If we do not contribute our abilities and defend ourselves in time, once the communists roam around, I am afraid that people with property, land, and knowledge will be at a loss and have nowhere to turn. I hope that everyone thoroughly recognizes the seriousness of the communist bandits, recognizes that protecting the country requires protecting the home first, and protecting the home requires social stability. All men of age, regardless of poverty or wealth, regardless of class, should enthusiastically enlist in the army. This is the only way to defend ourselves and protect the country. In short, to prosper Greater Shanghai and stabilize Greater Shanghai, we must first start by training local forces and protecting Greater Shanghai. Otherwise, "if the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to!" This is something that every citizen should be wary of.

### Former Italian Territory Placed Under Italian Trusteeship; Agreement Reached on Three-Power Principle; Italians Overjoyed at Return of Trieste

[Reuters, New York, 21st] Top-level sources in the United States revealed today that the Western powers will issue a declaration within two weeks endorsing the recommendation to return the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy and support the placement of some of Italy's former African colonies under Italian trusteeship. An American representative on the Trusteeship Council stated that the Western powers have reached an agreement in principle to place Italian Somaliland and Eritrea under Italian trusteeship. Britain opposes placing Libya under Italian trusteeship because it has promised the local natives that they will never again be subjected to Italian control.

[United Press, Rome, 20th] The Italian people tonight welcomed the proposal to return Trieste to Italy. Political gatherings were interrupted by the news. Crowds gathered in front of radio stations, and people rushed to newspaper offices to buy extra editions. Cries of "Long live Trieste!" echoed through the streets of the ancient city, and the flag of the Republic fluttered from public and private buildings. Prime Minister Gasperi said, "This news makes me very happy. I am sure that justice is being served." A communist leader lamented, "We have to start all over again."

[Reuters, London, 20th] Milan Radio reported that Italian flags were hanging from the balconies of every building in Trieste, and crowds were singing Italian patriotic songs in the streets to celebrate the decision of the three powers, Britain, the United States, and France, to return the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy. [United Press, Washington, 20th] The United States today took the surprising step of jointly proposing with Britain and France to return the Trieste area to Italy. Diplomatic authorities believe that this is a swift action to help the anti-communist faction in Italy win in the upcoming elections. Trieste is an area coveted by Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union is in a difficult position. If it supports the proposal of the United States, Britain, and France, it will displease Yugoslavia. If the Soviet Union opposes the return of Trieste, it will deal a blow to the Italian Communist Party and prevent it from winning popular support. The occupation of Trieste is Italy's biggest political problem, and the Italian Communist Party is hoping for Soviet action. If the Soviet Union and the Western countries cannot compromise, Trieste will be an indefinitely divided area between the British-American occupation zone and the Yugoslav army occupation zone, which could lead to danger. The Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, Kosa Novic, was deeply shocked by the proposal of Britain, the United States, and France, and said, "I don't know if this move is intended to provoke Yugoslavia to take a step that would give other countries an excuse to directly participate in the situation. I don't know why the US government is unwilling to contribute to the UN organization in everything."

### France and Italy Sign Customs Union; Bidault Meets with Italian Prime Minister

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 21st Broadcasting: Turin News, French Foreign Minister Bidault declared at a press conference today that he was deeply pleased with the repercussions caused by the Western countries' suggestion to return the Trieste area to Italy within Italian territory. When asked whether this announcement was intended to influence the Italian elections on April 18, Mr. Pi extended his hands and smiled, saying: "Nothing to report." Yesterday, Mr. Pierre met with Italian Prime Minister Gasperi and he will discuss the recommendations of Britain, the United States, and France regarding Trieste. Today, Italian Foreign Minister Sfors attended the meeting with Mr. Pierre. He expressed his deep happiness with the new developments regarding the Trieste problem, and believed that this action could strike a blow at the Communist Party's position in the elections. It is reported that this recommendation was already prepared three weeks ago, but the United States hopes that Mr. Pierre can announce it in the area with the strongest communist forces in Italy when he visits Italy. On the Yugoslav side, the Communist Party newspaper claimed that this was a means played by the imperialists before the Italian elections.

[Reuters Turin, 20th] French Foreign Minister Pierre and Italian Foreign Minister Sfors today signed the French-Italian Customs Union Protocol, the French-Italian Commercial Agreement, and the Payment Agreement at the Madama Palace. At the signing ceremony, Mr. Pi declared that Britain, the United States, and France had suggested to the Soviet Union and Italy to return the Free Zone of Trieste to Italy. Italian Foreign Minister Sffsa expressed that the agreement signed today is unprecedented in modern history and will affect the ideas, interests, and property of 100 million people in France and Italy. These two great nations will show the world that while still maintaining their different traditional qualities, they can still engage in the most systematic and fruitful unity. The two great lights of Western civilization will increasingly increase their power.

### British and American Troops on Alert to Prevent Incidents in Trieste

[United Press, London, 21st] Well-informed sources say that Yugoslavia's reaction to the Western allies' return of Trieste could create a "tense or dangerous" situation in the area. They said that if a backlash occurs, the 10,000 British and American troops in the area will be ordered to stand guard. A spokesman said that a demonstration "is often possible" in Yugoslavia around Trieste, but that steps have been taken to prevent clashes between Italians and Slavs. It is reported that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, had considered the Slav response and its consequences at the Paris conference last week.

### Western European Five Nations to Discuss Establishing a Consultative Committee

Nordic Three Nations Deny Discussing Joint Defense

[Reuters, Brussels, 20th] Representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the five nations of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will hold a special meeting here next Wednesday to discuss the five-nation consultative committee stipulated in the Western European Union treaty. Recommendations will be made to the governments of the five nations on the following three points: (1) where should the headquarters of the consultative committee be located, and where should meetings be held; (2) when should meetings be held; (3) the organization of the secretariat and the question of appointing a secretary-general. The representatives of the five nations will be the British, French, and Dutch Ambassadors to Belgium, the Luxembourg Minister to Belgium, and a senior official from the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 20th] Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft today denied rumors that the meeting of the three Scandinavian Prime Ministers held in Stockholm had discussed the issue of a defense alliance.

### East-West Split Entering a New Stage; Communist Influence Spreading

[Reuters, London, 21st] Observers here say that the arrival of the Finnish delegation in Moscow and the actions Moscow takes in the coming days will usher the development of the East-West confrontation into a new phase. The division of Europe is now nearly complete, with, on one side, the countries participating in the Marshall Aid Plan, and on the other, the countries echoing the Soviet Union's opposition to the Marshall Plan. The growth of Communist influence has made rapid progress in recent years. Before the war, there were only 160,000 Communist Party members in the Eastern European countries of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania, but today that number has reached six million. The governments of the seven Eastern European countries controlled by the Communist Party govern 90 million people. In the Far East, the Chinese Communist Party had only 700,000 members before the war, but today that number has reached two million, and the North Korean Communist Party claims to have ten million members. At the end of 1947, the Communist Party also established the Communist Information Bureau, with its headquarters in Belgrade. Recently, it has been reported that Communist Information Bureaus have also been established in Harbin and Sydney. The establishment of this institution coincides with the gradual concretization of the Marshall Plan. It is expected that the conflict between Eastern and Western forces will become more acute.

### German Elected Government May Be Established This Winter

[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] People here expect that a German government based on free elections may be established this winter. If the Soviet Union agrees, this government will be the government of the entire Germany; otherwise, it will be the German government of West Germany. It is believed here that the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France have tentatively agreed on the principle of restoring the German government when they meet in London to discuss the German question, but at the same time, they will formulate occupation measures to regulate the rights and obligations of Germans and occupying countries. People here hope that when the three powers resume consultations in April, they can finalize this interim agreement and decide on a timetable for holding direct German elections. British and American officials here believe that, according to international law and the laws of occupation, the rapid establishment of a democratically elected German government and its participation in the European Recovery Program is the best response to the Communist offensive against Germany. It is also believed here that it is no longer necessary to be afraid of the Communist propaganda of "opposing the division of Germany" if the Western countries adopt affirmative policies. The Soviet Union's active propaganda of the "German People's Congress for Unity and a Reasonable Peace" has completely failed in West Germany.

### Soviet Scientists Prove Life on Mars

[United Press, London, 20th] TASS, 20th: A Soviet astronomer claims that Soviet scientists have proven the existence of life on Mars and are planning to map the "vegetation" of Mars.

### Allied Control Council for Germany Holds Meeting; Soviet Representative Withdraws Midway, Virtually Announcing the End of Joint Control; This Action Appears to Be Premeditated

[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] The Soviet delegation, led by Marshal Sokolovsky, withdrew from today's meeting of the Four-Power Allied Control Council after Sokolovsky stated, "I feel it is meaningless to continue this meeting." Before withdrawing, Sokolovsky also said, "The actions of the Western countries prove that they have violated the agreement on the control of Germany, and therefore confirm that the Allied Control Council is no longer an institution for the four countries to implement control." After Sokolovsky withdrew, General Clay, the U.S. military commander, took the chair, and the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France continued the meeting. They decided that the date of the next meeting of the Allied Control Council would be determined later. A British spokesperson later said that there was no reason to believe that the next meeting would not be held. At the beginning of today's meeting of the Allied Control Council, the Soviet representative suggested discussing the resolutions passed by the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia and Poland at a meeting in Prague on February 18. British military commander Robertson, with the endorsement of France and the United States, stated that since the Prague resolutions were put forward at the government level, they should not be discussed in the Allied Control Council. Sokolovsky then stated that since the Western Allies were unwilling to discuss the important matters raised by Germany's three neighboring countries, it was clear that the Western Allies no longer regarded the Allied Control Council as an institution for controlling occupied Germany. He also accused the Western countries of using the Allied Control Council as a smokescreen to cover up their actions. Sokolovsky stated that since the Western countries refused to discuss the "Prague resolutions," he would withdraw them. He then attacked the London talks on the German question held by Britain, the United States, and France, accusing the three powers of neither notifying the Allied Control Council in advance nor keeping the details of the meeting secret afterward. Robertson then replied that the London meeting was a temporary consultation that only made recommendations to their respective governments and did not form a resolution. After the governments formed a resolution, they would naturally notify the Allied Control Council. General Clay and French military commander Koenig both expressed their agreement with Robertson's opinion. Thereupon, Sokolovsky read a pre-prepared long statement, stating that "The Allied Control Council is no longer an institution for the four countries to implement control." After reading it, he stormed out of the meeting, and the entire Soviet delegation followed him. Sokolovsky's leading the entire Soviet delegation out of the Allied Control Council indicates that the Soviet government believes that the joint control of Germany by the four powers has ended, and Germany has definitively split into two. Sokolovsky's reading of a pre-prepared statement further shows that the Soviet action was premeditated rather than taken on the spur of the moment. According to a dispatch from Paris, responsible observers believe that Sokolovsky's action is a serious gesture. His statement that "The Allied Control Council is no longer a four-power control agency" may be announcing the end of the Berlin Allied Control Council. This action by the Soviet Union may reflect its unease after the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France intensified their solidarity in West Germany. When U.S. military commander Clay was asked afterward whether Sokolovsky's action indicated the end of the four-power control government over Germany, Clay said that it was not necessarily so and that it would depend on future developments to decide. According to a senior American diplomat participating in the Allied Control Council, the withdrawal of the Soviet delegation from the meeting was clearly a pre-planned move.

### Britain Seeks to Avert the Crisis; Some Suggest a Summit Meeting Between British and Soviet Leaders; Shinwell Hopes the Soviet Union Can Be Frank and Make a Statement

[Reuters, London, 20th] British Labour MP Cocks will submit a motion to the House of Commons, asking Prime Minister Attlee, South African President Smuts, and Indian Governor-General Mountbatten to form a delegation to visit Marshal Stalin to seek a status quo agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union and between Eastern and Western Europe based on mutual non-interference in each other's spheres of influence. At the same time, Secretary of State for War Shinwell said in a speech in Windsor today that he welcomed Soviet leaders to make a frank statement so that people could "take a breath of fresh air." He also said that a war with the Soviet Union was unimaginable.

### Finnish Delegation Departs for Moscow

[United Press, Helsinki, 21st] The Finnish delegation left here this morning for Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union. When the delegation's special train left the station, a group of non-Communists sang the national anthem, while a group of Communists gathered on the other side of the station, responding with "The Internationale." The situation was tense for a moment, but the Communists eventually changed and sang the national anthem with the non-Communists, and the tension eased. The delegation is led by Foreign Minister Enckell and includes seven main representatives and many political, military, and technical advisors. Soviet Minister to Finland Lieutenant General Savonenkov is accompanying them.

### Australian Foreign Minister Calls for Peace

[Reuters, Canberra, 21st] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt recently made a speech to the Australian Committee of the United Nations, stating, "We must stop the trend towards war at all costs." He said that no responsible person in the world wants war. The United Nations organization is the hope for world peace and raising living standards. The greatest contribution that people of goodwill can make to the world is to fully support the United Nations. Accepting the pessimistic predictions of a third world war is defeatism.

### After the US Abandons the Partition Plan for the Holy Land, Jews Will Establish a Jewish State; Marshall Admits that Abandoning Partition Was His Idea

[United Press, Jerusalem, 20th] Well-informed sources said tonight that after the United States abandoned the partition plan for Palestine, Jewish leaders would almost immediately announce the establishment of a Hebrew state in Palestine. Jewish combat forces have made it clear that they will use force to defend the borders of this state. The Arabs are hesitant about whether to continue fighting. However, there are still scattered Arab-Jewish conflicts in various parts of Palestine. Arab army commander Ghulqi told a reporter, "We entered Pakistan not to attack partition, but to attack Zionism. Whether the United States supports partition or not is irrelevant."

[United Press, Tel Aviv, Palestine, 20th] Jewish Public Council member Greenbaum said tonight that the Jewish state already exists and will be defended by the Jewish army. Only Jews can determine the fate of their homeland. The Jews will never accept temporary or permanent foreign trusteeship.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall admitted on the evening of the 20th that the decision of the United States to abandon the partition plan for Palestine was conceived by him personally.

US Change of Position will Test the UN

[United Press, dispatch] American officials and other United Nations diplomats here point out that the United States is seriously considering how to make its new proposal for Palestine avoid Soviet opposition and its veto power. The US side confirms that no matter how strongly the Soviet Union opposes this new plan, it will be passed, and emphasizes that the basic principles of the new plan will not be defeated by the veto power. The US's new plan for Palestine will first be submitted to the Security Council. If the Soviet Union uses its veto power, the US can bypass the Security Council to achieve its goals. If the Soviet Union vetoes the Security Council's convening of the United Nations General Assembly, the US is prepared to suggest that a special session be convened by a majority of the fifty-seven nations. However, convening the General Assembly through the Security Council can save time, and the time factor is very important at present, as Britain's trusteeship will end on May 15. Although British officials have repeatedly stated that the trusteeship will end on May 15, there is still hope here that British troops can postpone their withdrawal to wait for the US trusteeship plan to be passed and implemented. United Nations officials deeply fear that canceling the partition plan will further reduce the UN's credibility. Some quarters believe that the Palestinian question and the Czech crisis may turn the United Nations into a group of Western countries directly opposing the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] There are two motives behind the US government's proposal to abandon the Pakistan partition plan: (1) to avoid the simultaneous deployment of US and Soviet troops to Palestine for guard duty; (2) to protect US oil rights in Arab countries.

The British Side Originally Wished to Change; Determination to Withdraw Troops from the Holy Land

[Central News Agency, London dispatch] Officials announced that Britain will terminate its mandate over the Holy Land on May 15, regardless of the US decision to abandon the partition plan, and will withdraw all British troops by August 1. The British Colonial Office said that the current new situation does not affect the British government's determination to terminate its mandate on schedule.

### Pro-Soviet Czech Foreign Minister Explains Czech Diplomatic Creed; Treat Honesty with Honesty and Exchange Friendship for Friendship

[Reuters, dispatch] Czech Foreign Minister Clementis delivered his first broadcast speech since taking office, pointing out that some parties deliberately launched war propaganda, like that of the hysterics, to cover up other more dangerous events, such as using Germany as an economic alliance and political springboard against its former victims. Clementis said that the Security Council's acceptance of Chile's complaint that the Soviet Union pressured the Czech government to accept Communist demands was shameful. Finally, he said that Czech foreign policy would not change and would remain "loyalty for loyalty, friendship for friendship."

### Bridges Asks for Explanation of US Military Preparation Plan

Military and Political Leaders to Report to the Senate Today

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today demanded that the government inform Congress under what circumstances the United States intends to go to war to deter the Soviet Union. He said that this question "must" be answered before Congress votes on President Truman's proposed universal military training bill and the European Recovery Program funding. Bridges said that Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal will be invited to provide information on this matter when they appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 22nd.

### Japan May Receive US Aid Next Year; US$765 Million; US Investigation Team in Japan to Review the Japanese Economy

[United Press, Washington, 21st] The results of a United Press investigation of planned legislation are as follows: If current congressional and official plans come to fruition, Japan could receive US$765 million in loans from the United States in the next fiscal year. Authorities say this number may increase again when the Army and State Department complete their plans to restore Japanese industry to pre-war levels. The US's intensified aid to Japan is expected to provoke opposition from some Far Eastern countries, especially China, as China is only receiving US$570 million in economic aid and very limited military aid.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Under Secretary of the Army Draper and the US industrial delegation he led arrived here today. Draper told reporters that the delegation would review Japan's economic progress and discuss with MacArthur plans to revive the Japanese economy and make it self-sufficient.

### Ashida's Policy Address; Japanese Parties Express Dissatisfaction

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Prime Minister Ashida's policy address to the Diet on the 20th is generally regarded by the Japanese people as being for external propaganda and is not taken seriously. The reactions of the various political parties are recorded as follows: (1) Democratic Liberal Party: "There was no explanation of the countermeasures against inflation, taxes, and prices, which are of greatest concern to the current Japanese people. Everything is entrusted to dependence on foreign countries, and no measures for Japan's self-reliance were pointed out. It is self-deception to say that self-reliance can obtain foreign aid. Chief Secretary Kurisu's speech merely repeats the policies of the previous Katayama cabinet and has no new content"; (2) Socialist Party: "Prime Minister Ashida's speech was mostly from an international standpoint, and there was no clear indication of domestic policies, which is a pity. As for Chief Secretary Kurisu, he merely listed items without knowing what the outcome will be"; (3) Socialist Reform Party: "Ashida's speech was empty and meaningless, and it was an expression of the cabinet's irresponsibility."

### Our Delegation Arrives in Geneva

Mr. White was appointed as the Secretary-General of the Executive Committee.

### International Socialist Conference

Most Italian Socialists Not Participating

[Reuters, London, 20th] The entire delegation of the majority Italian Socialist Party (the Socialist Party led by Nenni), in protest against the resolution condemning the Communist Information Bureau, withdrew from the meeting when the International Socialist Committee met today. Afterward, Molendi, one of the representatives of the delegation, told the agency that the representatives of the majority Italian Socialist Party also did not intend to participate in the Socialist Party conference to discuss the Marshall Plan to be held on Sunday. The Socialist Party conference on the Marshall Plan, convened by the British Labour Party, is scheduled to be held on Sunday in the Selsdon Park area near London. Apart from the Nenni faction of the majority Italian Socialist Party, which has already stated that it will not participate, the representatives who participated in today's meeting of the International Socialist Committee will all attend. That conference will be closed to the public.

### Former Burmese Prime Minister U Saw to Be Hanged on April 9

[Reuters, Yangon, 20th] Official news: U Saw, the former Prime Minister who was the main culprit in the assassination of former Prime Minister Aung San and other cabinet members, will be executed by hanging on April 9. After U Saw was initially sentenced to death by a special court, his appeal was rejected by the Yangon High Court on March 8. It has recently been reported that U Saw's defense lawyer is still planning to appeal to the Supreme Court of Myanmar on his behalf.

### Allied Council Cables Security Council, Rejects Our Proposal; Positive Reaction in India

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 21st] The Muslim League in Punjab Province, India, passed a resolution in Lahore yesterday, criticizing the Chinese proposal to the Security Council on the Kashmir issue as completely unacceptable.

### Conscription Lottery to Be Held Tomorrow; To Increase Citizens' Awareness of Military Service; Military Service Association to Hold Propaganda Rally at the Queen's Theatre Today

The conscription process for new recruits in this city, apart from background checks and applications for deferments, which are handled according to the information obtained last year, and the arrangement and numbering of eligible men, has been rushed to completion by the Military Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau. The "1948 Conscription Indirect Lottery Ceremony" will be held at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow in the auditorium of the City Council. Mayor Wu will preside over the event. The city headquarters of the Kuomintang, the China Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, the City Council, the Garrison District, the Regiment District, the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, the High Prosecutor's Office, the District Prosecutor's Office, the District Court, the Lawyers' Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the City Farmers' Association, and local associations have also been invited to send representatives to supervise the event. More than eighty members of the lottery committee of the Military Service Association, which is in an advisory position, will attend the event in full. It is understood that the lottery method is not limited to drawing only the number of recruits assigned from all eligible men. Every eligible man who is included in the roster of eligible men will draw a lot, but this does not mean that they have been "selected." It only determines the order of conscription. For example, if there are still vacancies after registering volunteers, the lottery numbers at the top of the list will be checked against the sealed numbering roster, and they will be conscripted. If there are not enough, they will be filled in order. This numbered roster will be sealed until it is needed for conscription. Therefore, the results of the lottery can only reveal which number will be conscripted first and which number will be conscripted last. It is not possible to know in advance which number belongs to which person. Moreover, the numbers on the roster are placed in no particular order, so this method is absolutely fair and reasonable.

In addition, the Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai Military Service Association, in order to make citizens deeply aware of the meaning of military service, will hold a military service propaganda rally at the Queen's Theatre on Xizang Middle Road at 9:00 a.m. today. Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Xu Jikun, Zhang Xiaosong, Fu Zhengmo, Chen Tianqiao, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xianqing, and others have been invited to form the presidium. Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan will attend to provide guidance. After the meeting, there will also be wonderful entertainment programs, such as the opera "Sending My Husband to War" by Li Jingjie and others, the drama "Joining the Army" by the Pacification Drama Troupe, "Military Music" by Xiao Kuaile, and Mo Feixian's magic show. People from all walks of life are welcome to participate freely, and no admission tickets are required.

### Silk Factory Layoff Dispute: Bureau of Social Affairs to Mediate Today

Since the Spring Festival this year, the industrial sector has gradually shown signs of depression. The Huacheng Silk Factory at 1140 Kangding Road in West Shanghai has not reopened since the Spring Festival. Citing the unstable environment in the city, the factory plans to relocate its business to Hong Kong. On the 19th of last month, it posted a notice laying off 50 workers. The remaining 40 workers were told that if they wished to go to Hong Kong, they could go, otherwise, they would also be laid off. However, the labor side did not agree because the factory did not pay severance, leading to a stalemate until the 17th of this month, when the factory stopped providing meals, and the situation became serious. The workers elected representatives to go to the Silk Thread Industry Union in the Third District to seek support. The Union then accompanied them to the Bureau of Social Affairs to petition, requesting three points: (1) resume work as usual, (2) continue to provide meals as usual, and (3) pay severance to laid-off workers. The Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled a meeting this afternoon to convene labor and management for mediation.

### Smuggling Greatly Reduced After the Sino-British Agreement Signed

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling authorities: In recent months, smuggling has greatly improved. Since the signing of the Sino-British Agreement, large-scale smuggling of entire ships has not been discovered. However, it is difficult to eradicate sporadic smuggling of small amounts of contraband. Currently, the Customs Anti-Smuggling authorities have dispatched additional anti-smuggling personnel to conduct strict searches of crew cabins and passenger luggage. They have also contacted the shipping companies to automatically punish crew members or sailors found smuggling or assisting in smuggling. It is said that current smuggled goods are mostly silk stockings, foreign wine, and Western medicine. Most of these goods are prohibited from import. Therefore, smuggling not only evades tariffs but also evades control, undermining the national economic policy and causing significant harm. The Customs authorities urgently hope that the people will report and assist the government.

### Engineering Circle Grand Event: Chinese Technology Association: Holds Second Anniversary: Two Movements Hope for Support from All Sectors

[Our Newspaper's Report] The second anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Technology Association was held at the Central Research Institute on Yueyang Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The attendees included the association's full members Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, Zhuang Zhihuan, Gu Yuxiu, Wu Zhesheng, He Shangping, Hu Juewen, Wang Shengsan, Wang Ziyang, Zai Hanmin, Zhou Ren, etc., and 250 basic members. First, Song Mingshi, the chairman of the Technology Association, reported on the activities of the past year, stating that although the material conditions were extremely difficult at the beginning of the Technology Association, it successively held the Chinese Chemical Laboratory, technical vocational schools, and exhibitions. The number of Technology Association members has increased from hundreds to 2,500 in the past year, and they are now actually participating in various production works. Therefore, it has become an inseparable part of the entire social life. However, the living conditions of technical personnel are poor, and there is an urgent need to initiate: (1) a technical personnel life subsidy movement, (2) raising funds, developing businesses, and expanding the association, in order to strengthen unity, overcome difficulties together, wait for the arrival of the new era, contribute what they have learned, and serve the country. It is hoped that these two movements can receive enthusiastic support from all sectors of society.

Technical Education: Popularize Society

Then, Zhuang Zhihuan, the general manager of the Technology Association and the director of the Technology Department of the Bank of Communications, said that at this stage, if China wants to build a large-scale industry, both human and material resources are insufficient. It is better to start with the development of small and medium-sized industries. However, simply relying on technical personnel to promote the construction of industrialization is not as effective as popularizing technical education in society first. He suggested that the Technology Association should do more work on "socializing technical training" so that the public can recognize the importance of production, engage in production together, increase the middle class, and establish the stability of society.

Coordinate with National Policy: Engage in Production

Subsequently, Gu Yuxiu quoted Datong Pian, "Hate that the force does not come from oneself, not necessarily for oneself," to encourage the Technology Association to work hard, so that the entire society can move from "everyone has food to eat" to "everyone has food to eat." Zhao Zukang called on the Technology Association to: (1) strengthen cooperation, (2) have the spirit of Christ, to unite the national technical youth and advocate a "New May Fourth Movement" to move towards the goal of "Industrial Revolution" together. Finally, Zhao Zengjue put forward three points: (1) pay attention to the cultivation of people, (2) use foreign capital as the forerunner of China's industry, and (3) take into account production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales in the production process. He Shangping, Hu Juewen, and others also gave speeches, all encouraging all members to work hard without complaint, enrich themselves, stick to their posts, coordinate with national policies, and engage in production work. After the meeting, the Association resumed the gathering at the Law Society on Huangpi South Road for a dinner party, and held a charity sale and raffle. The entertainment began at 2:00 p.m., with dance, singing, drama and other programs, and ended at 5:00 p.m. This was the annual grand event in the engineering circle.

### Bandit Groups Rob Cotton: Activity at Various Wharves: Decision to Strictly Arrest According to Law

Since the National Cotton and Yarn Management Committee implemented the unified purchase and distribution of cotton, a large amount of cotton purchased from various places has recently been transported to Shanghai. When the cotton arrived at various wharves for unloading and transfer, it was discovered that there were unemployed hooligans who gathered to violently rob and plunder, and the losses were very large. Yuan Liang, the chairman of the committee, was very angry. After consulting with the municipal government to strictly stop it, the municipal government ordered the municipal police bureau to start investigating the hooligan groups robbing cotton at various wharves from today. They will be arrested and punished on the spot in the future and will never be lenient. It is reported that this group of illegal hooligans is an organized group, and the number of people in the so-called "Thirty-Six Gangs" is even more numerous. This hooligan group is using refugees and bums to operate at various wharves. It is heard that the Hong Kong Zheng Association's investigation team has also set up a method to eliminate them.

"Since returning to China last year, I have found that many young people I have come into contact with generally have feelings of anxiety and suffering. There are two main reasons for this: one is personal, such as family discord, financial difficulties, romantic setbacks, etc.; the other is due to the state of the nation and society. Because in the two and a half years since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the country has failed to achieve peace and reconstruction, but is instead engulfed in war, affecting traffic congestion, economic bankruptcy, political corruption, rising prices, and the decline of social morality. Young people are even more anxious and pained to witness this situation.

In fact, feelings of anxiety and suffering are not unique to Chinese youth; the youth of other countries around the world are no different. What I saw in Europe and the United States was that, for example, in Britain after the war, there was a shortage of materials, no coal for heating in winter, and food was rationed, with only one egg per week. In France, due to war damage, resources were even scarcer than in Britain. In Germany, after defeat, under the control of others, it goes without saying. In the Soviet Union, there were many beggars on the streets, and the people's lives were also very hard. In the United States, although material life could still maintain pre-war levels, there was also spiritual unease because communism was expanding and spreading day by day after the war, and a third world war could break out at any time, so they were constantly worried. So, in short, the youth of all countries in the world have their own suffering and anxiety. However, we must not be too anxious and take the road of pessimism, which will only lead to self-destruction. We should believe that there is hope in everything, and that the future is bright.

Lincoln's Childhood Was Difficult

In terms of personal anxiety, we believe that as long as one is determined and willing to work hard, no matter how difficult the environment, there is hope of solving the problem and succeeding. There are many such precedents in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. For example, US President Lincoln had a very bad childhood environment. His family lived in a thatched shack, and he started working at the age of six or seven, without the opportunity to go to school. However, he used his spare time to study hard and finally acquired rich knowledge and wisdom and became the President of the United States. Another example is the great scientist Edison, whose family was also very poor. He worked as a waiter on a train in his teens, and when the passengers were asleep, he did chemical experiments on the train. In such an environment, he worked hard to study and later invented eight hundred kinds of scientific instruments, benefiting mankind. Another example is our leader, Chairman Chiang, whose childhood environment was also not good. He lost his father at the age of eight, leaving behind a widow and orphans, and life was difficult. But he did not lose heart or ambition and finally achieved his later career. Therefore, no matter how difficult the environment, as long as you set your sights far and wide, do not be discouraged by trivial matters, and take your life's career as your goal, you will surely achieve success through hard work.

Although the Country Is Chaotic, the Future Is Still Hopeful

In terms of the overall national situation, although the current situation is chaotic, the future is still bright and hopeful. This can be seen from several things: First, our current international status is unprecedented in a hundred years. Foreign privileges in China have been completely abolished. Second, although our progress in various fields is slower than that of other countries, it is indeed much faster than it was forty or fifty years ago. Forty or fifty years ago, our people's intelligence was very immature. For example, when they saw foreigners' suits and trousers were straight, they thought foreigners' legs were straight. Another example is the fear of photography, thinking that it was foreigners coming to take their souls. Such ideas seem very ridiculous now. In terms of organizational ability, we have also made much progress now. In the past, the so-called "yamen" (government office) was used for two things: litigation and paying taxes. Apart from that, it can be said that it had nothing to do with the people. Although we are still behind other countries now, at least the organization is complete. Third, although communism is expanding and spreading, it will ultimately fail. Because communists are savage and cruel, implementing policies of killing everywhere, and going against human nature, even ordering sons to kill their fathers, wives to kill their husbands, and brothers to kill their brothers. This ideology is not in line with our national conditions and will not gain the sympathy of the people. Therefore, even if its current strength is expanding, it will eventually be eliminated. Furthermore, in terms of Chinese history, the chaotic situations in the past dynasties were even worse than the current one, such as the Rebellion of the Five Barbarians at the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Rebellion of the Five Dynasties at the end of the Tang Dynasty, and the Rebellion of Li Zicheng at the end of the Ming Dynasty, all of which caused national turmoil and social unrest, but in the end, they all recovered and prospered, and returned to normal. Therefore, as long as we work hard and improve politically and economically, we will surely have a bright future in the shortest possible time.

### Democratic Countries Will Surely Win

The world situation is also like this. As a result of the struggle between communism and democratic countries, I believe that victory will belong to the latter. In the past, because democratic countries could not unite, they allowed communism to expand day by day. However, recently, European countries have been uniting, such as the mutual assistance treaty signed by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and the economic conference held in Paris by sixteen Western European countries, all to defend against Soviet aggression. The United States has a very clear understanding of communism, and in order to defend against communism, its assistance to other countries has also been increasing day by day, so the entire world also has a bright outlook.

Finally, what is worth mentioning is that with the progress of science, mankind has unlimited hope for the future. In the past fifty years, mankind's scientific progress has far surpassed the achievements of the past five thousand years. And the progress in the next fifty years is believed to be even greater than the current fifty years. Especially the atomic energy discovered in this war, I believe that within ten to fifteen years, it will surely be applied to industry and greatly improve human life. According to scientists' estimates, in the future, people will only have to work four hours a day to be able to maintain their lives. Therefore, whether from the perspective of the individual, the country, the world, or the future of mankind, the future is bright and splendid. Young people born in the twentieth century are really very enviable. I hope everyone can discard their worries and make full use of this rare opportunity."

### Gleanings from Burma

[Our Newspaper Rangoon, 14th (Airmail)] With the assistance of China National Aviation Corporation, our press corps' trip from Shanghai to Rangoon not only transported us to a new climate, but also gave us a distinctly different taste and impression of life in a foreign land.

Special Cuisine

On the fifth day in Rangoon, an overseas Chinese invited us to his home for a Burmese meal, which was our first taste of Burmese flavor. Burmese cuisine is similar to Chinese cuisine in form, but the taste of the cooking is very different. Its characteristics are spiciness and greasiness, plus an indescribable fishy smell. Some of our colleagues in the press corps were actually able to eat with relish, but the others and I found it very difficult to swallow. However, out of consideration for the host's feelings, we had to force ourselves to eat some to get by. A day later, the Burmese Foreign Minister invited us to his official residence for dinner. This was a great kindness on his part to our Chinese press corps, but for us, it was another ordeal. The meal was considered very lavish in Burma, but it was even more difficult to eat than the meal at the overseas Chinese's home the day before.

Eating with Hands

In order to maintain diplomatic etiquette, we gritted our teeth and forced ourselves to eat, and we also had to suppress any expressions of disgust. We finally managed to get through the dishes and rice when the waiter brought up a small plate of mixed tidbits, containing shredded ginger, sesame seeds, peanuts, and fried noodles. Everyone mixed it with their hands and ate it by grabbing. (Burmese people eat like Indians, all with their hands. When entertaining us, the dishes were served with knives and forks, but these tidbits had to be eaten with hands.) That wasn't all. Finally, the Foreign Minister, to show his respect for the guests, specially brought out a plate of pickled tea leaves to introduce. These tea leaves were pickled until they were black like dried vegetables and were considered a supreme delicacy in their eyes. Ambassador Tu Yuntan was also present that day, and he was sitting next to the Burmese Foreign Minister. I saw that he was also reluctantly accepting the tea, picking up a few leaves and grabbing them for a long time before putting them into his mouth. The most interesting thing was one of our colleagues. He was about to throw up from eating, but he was still spouting diplomatic rhetoric, saying, "Very good! Very good! Almost the same as Chinese cuisine!" When the meal was over and we took our leave, he exclaimed, "Hard labor! Hard labor!" as soon as he got into the car.

Top and Bottom Attire

The attire of the Burmese people is divided into two parts, top and bottom. For the lower half of the body, both men and women wear sarongs, which are made by folding a piece of cloth in half and sewing it together, like a cage that is slipped over the lower half of the body, with a knot tied tightly at the waist. For the upper half of the body, women wear thin gauze long-sleeved shirts, which are wrapped very tightly, so that you can see the small vests covering their chests and backs underneath. Men usually wear something like a Western suit shirt, but when they encounter a formal gathering or ceremony, they add a white mandarin jacket on top, and wrap their heads in a red and green cloth scarf, tied in a knot on the right side. This kind of headgear is quite reminiscent of the Robin Hood-like characters in our martial arts novels or legends.

Burmese Women

I remember that there was an American film starring Dorothy Lamour called "Burma Road," which made viewers fascinated by Burma and gave them endless fantasies about the Burmese people. However, the Burmese women we saw in Rangoon were all ugly. Almost everyone's face was smeared with a kind of bark powder that looked like lime. It is said that this bark powder has a cooling effect. They are all very short, and their facial features do not meet the conditions for beauty. If you had to say something good about them, it would be that the sarongs are wrapped tightly, so their waists are very slender and their curves are still distinct.

A Glimpse of Housing

Because of the humid climate in Rangoon, the floors of Burmese people's houses are usually a considerable distance from the ground, and some houses are propped up by pillars, with only one story upstairs, and the stairs are installed outside the house. The majority of Burmese people are poor, and their houses are dilapidated wooden shacks and thatched cottages. As for the wealthy Burmese people or government officials, they live in Western-style houses with the latest equipment.

Big and Small Golden Pagodas

Burma is a Buddhist country. Although the influence of Buddhism has been declining in recent times, you can still see monks in red and yellow robes on the streets of Rangoon at any time, and the most famous sight in Burma is the golden pagoda, a Buddhist sacred site. There is one large and one small golden pagoda in Rangoon. In addition to various Buddha statues, the large golden pagoda also contains all kinds of small pagodas with pointed tops. Anyone must take off their shoes before entering the golden pagoda, otherwise the Burmese people believe that they are desecrating the gods and will attack them in droves. However, the stone steps inside the golden pagoda are very dirty. After we took off our shoes and toured around, the bottoms of our socks were covered with bird droppings and mud.

Vehicles and Police

There are a lot of crows in Rangoon, and they are constantly making noise in the morning and evening. There are also many movie theaters in the urban area. In addition to these, there are two things that are more special. One is the rickshaw, which is different from those in Shanghai. Seats and another wheel are installed on the right side of the rear wheel of the bicycle. The seats are in front of and behind each other, so two people can sit back to back. The other is the traffic police at the intersections. They wave their hands when directing traffic, giving individual directions to each car, so they don't stop for a moment. Their gestures are very funny, but they can last for a long time without getting tired, which shows that they have all undergone some training!

Inside the Presidential Palace

On the noon of the day before we left Rangoon, we went to visit the President of Burma, Sao Shwe Thaik. The President received us in a very small office. He was wearing a Western suit, and the suit was so old that it looked like it was sold on Wusong Road in Shanghai. He was originally a tribal chieftain who had been to Yunnan and could speak the Yunnan dialect. But he claimed that he had forgotten it and spoke to us in English that was not easy to understand. We sat for about ten minutes and then took our leave. It is said that this President has four wives, but when the Burmese people elected him as President, they put forward a condition that he was only allowed to bring one wife into the Presidential Palace, so now only his third wife lives with him. We felt that his life in the Presidential Palace seemed to be very lonely. (Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong)

### Shaoxing Jianhu Town Troop Leader Buys Draftees, Loses Both People and Money: Offender Zhou Linchang Interrogated

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 20th] Luo Ying, a troop leader from Jianhu Town, Shaoxing, came to Hangzhou to buy draftees and was swindled, resulting in a loss of both people and money. Luo came to Hangzhou on the 12th to buy two draftees to fill the quota for the town. Zhou Linchang arranged for this in Hangzhou, entrusting the matter to Jin Xiaomao. Jin then negotiated with Wang A'quan. It was agreed that two draftees would be purchased for 20 million. Luo went on the morning of the 13th, paid 16.5 million in cash and a gold ring weighing two mace and five candareens, and agreed to deliver the people at noon on the 14th. However, when Luo went on time, he lost both people and money, so he reported the matter to the police station. Only Zhou Linchang was arrested, and it was found that Zhou was a professional draftee trafficker. The case is currently being investigated further by the Municipal Criminal Police Team.

[Our Newspaper Changshu, 20th] In order to improve conscription administration, the county government specially convened a conscription conference, which decided to establish volunteer soldier registration offices in various districts. The fixed family support fee was set at 80 million, and voluntary plowing teams were organized to replace the draftees who were selected to do spring plowing. Based on a tip-off, Gu Jinshan and 40 other draftees being trafficked were captured in the Zeng Family Garden. They were divided into three groups from Wuxi, Shanghai, and northern Jiangsu. Some of them had received secondary education, but were trafficked to Changshu to enlist as volunteers due to their poor families. The mastermind is at large and is currently being investigated.

### The Main Culprit in the Case of the Murder of Zhao Wenying Has Been Arrested; Remaining Culprits Are Being Arrested

[Our Newspaper Wujin, 19th] In September of last year, Zhao Wenying, a gentleman from Longhutang Township in the northern part of our county, was strangled and his body was abandoned in the fields. Later, Wenying's son, Yongyao, and the Criminal Police Team arrested the suspects Zhang Chifu, etc. and imprisoned them, but the case has not been closed. Recently, it was learned that the main culprits in the case, Zhou Huangqing and Wan Rongcai, were hiding in Shanghai, living lavishly, and still going in and out of public places with enemy puppet remnants such as Hu Shaochen for gambling. Therefore, the Criminal Police Team and Yongyao went to Shanghai to arrest them. At the same time, Wan Ronglin was also arrested in the Da Jiangnan Hotel in Wuxi. After the initial interrogation, they confessed to conspiring to murder Zhao Wenying. The inside story is complex and involves a wide range of people. The mastermind is Zhou Wangbao, the mistress of Zhou Huangqing and Wan Rongcai (Note: Zhou was a tiger in Changzhou: he was captured and shot by the Changzhenyang Suppression Command last year), who contacted the bandit armies of Li Qin and Xu Yunlong, as well as Zhou and others. The Criminal Police Team is continuing to arrest relevant criminals.

### Jiaxing Contests Business Profit Tax

[Our Newspaper Jiaxing, 20th] Because the amount of advance collection of the business profit tax in our county this year is too high, the Chamber of Commerce is fighting for it with the relevant departments. The Chamber of Commerce will handle this tax matter only after the Shanghai-Hangzhou authorities decide on a solution.

### Taiyuan Captures Disguised Bandits: Impersonating New Recruits and Poisoning People

[Our Newspaper Taiyuan, 20th (Telegram)] Zhang Zhenfa, a disguised bandit, was captured here. He infiltrated the Personal Training Division as a new recruit and secretly poisoned people. One soldier has died, and two are in critical condition. The poison is white and has a chronic stomach-ulcerating effect and is not a domestic product. The poison he used comes in a total of seven colors.

### Yiyang Landlords Oppose Rent Reduction Movement: Xiao Xun Expresses Determination to Fight for the Farmers

[Our Newspaper Changsha, 21st (Telegram)] Since Xiao Xun, Director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, led the rent reduction movement in Hunan Province, he has gained sympathy from all parties, but the landlord class is generally opposed to it. After the assassination of Deng Meikui in Yiyang, Xiao and Liu Xuru, Director of the Social Affairs Department, made every effort to support him, which led to a scene in which the landlords of Yiyang publicly attacked Xiao. It is learned that these landlords formally petitioned the Yiyang County Council to forward a long document of thousands of words to the Provincial Assembly, refuting "rent reduction to protect tenants." They said that Xiao, as an administrative officer, was also speculating and opportunistically, vilifying the landlords as local tyrants, and regarding struggle as a long-term strategy, using the banner of rent reduction to protect tenants to express his views on a disguised emancipation struggle. Xiao responded to this document by telling reporters in an extremely sad tone: "It is not surprising that the landlords of Yiyang are attacking me, but they have overestimated me." He also expressed his determination to fight to the end for the interests of the farmers of Hunan Province, and will go to Yiyang in person to investigate the Deng case as soon as possible in order to get to the bottom of the case?

### News in Brief

Hangzhou [Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, Zhejiang Province received an order from the Executive Yuan to publicly display the head as a barbaric method of execution in the old days, which is detrimental to international opinion, and specially instructed its subordinates to strictly prohibit it.

Jiashan [Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Dishan, a clerk in the Land Registration Office, recently committed suicide by hanging himself on the morning of the 20th because of his difficult life. He took advantage of the opportunity when his children went to school and his wife went to the market to buy groceries. When his wife returned home and discovered it, she was unable to save him.

Bengbu [Our Newspaper Report] The concentration military training for civil servants in Bengbu City is ready. At 2:00 p.m. on the 19th, the personnel from various agencies who were to receive military training gathered at the Bengshan Stadium to form a team, and military training will begin in the next few days.

Dangtu [Our Newspaper Report] On the 12th, Qin Zhongyu, a bandit leader, was captured in Room 12 of the Jiangdong Inn on Dongda Street in the city. He had previously joined forces to rob unpolished rice and killed people and threw them into the water. On the 17th, at about 12:00 midnight, Jin Yuxi, a member of the gang, was also captured in Daxinbao, Daqiao Township. Both were sent to the county government for handling. It is reported that each was worth fifteen to sixteen million.

Suxian [Our Newspaper Report] The spring famine in our county is serious. The young people who have fled from the bandit areas to the city have no way to make a living and are selling themselves (to become draftees) to survive. "Recruitment brokers" are rampant.

Chongming [Our Newspaper Report] The language of our county is indistinguishable from that of Qidong and Haimen Counties in northern Jiangsu, making it extremely easy for bandits from Qidong and Haimen to infiltrate. Although the garrison has repeatedly searched, the results have been minimal. Recently, it has been heard that someone has suggested that the authorities strictly compile and check the population of the villages along the northern border. If this can be effectively implemented and persisted in, it will definitely help maintain local order.

### Preparing to Attend the Central Research Institute Council Meeting: Hu Shih Arrived in Shanghai by Plane from Beiping Yesterday; Li Shuhua and Li Zongen Came South on the Same Flight

[Our Newspaper Report] Hu Shih, President of Peking University, Li Shuhua, President of the Beiping Research Institute, and Li Zongen, President of Peking Union Medical College, traveled together on an air overlord plane and arrived in Shanghai from Beiping at 6:10 p.m. yesterday. Hu will preside over the board meeting of Peking Union Medical College to be held in Shanghai on the 24th. After the meeting, he will travel to Nanjing with Li Shuhua to attend the Second Council Meeting of Academicians of the Central Research Institute to be held in Nanjing on the 25th to elect 100 academicians of the institute. After the Council Meeting, he will stay in Nanjing to attend the National Assembly.

Hu Shih's spirit was better this time than last year. He looked happy when he got off the plane. At the request of reporters, he took a group photo with Li Shuhua and Li Zongen. He then smiled and said, "After returning to Beiping from Shanghai last year, I had a serious illness. After recovering, I stopped smoking and drinking." After speaking, he got into the car and left. In the evening, reporters visited Hu Shih's residence at the International Hotel again.

Peking University's Finances Are Extremely Tight

Regarding the tight financial situation of Peking University, Hu Shih said: "We are extremely poor." The Ministry of Education approved 572.4 million yuan per month for the operating expenses of Peking University in the first half of the 37th year, but the expenses for February alone, for water and electricity, were 1.13 billion yuan. The school could not pay and had to incur debt. The life of the professors is miserable. Hu Shih's own monthly salary is 12 million yuan. It is said that this monthly salary is equivalent to about 15 yuan in pre-war legal tender, which can at most buy five bags of flour. The general salary of professors is around 10 million yuan. If they have three children, it is simply impossible to manage. The lives of other staff and students are even more unsustainable, and "academic research is out of the question." Hu Shih said that future problems cannot be solved by adjusting and increasing salaries. He said: When he took over as President of Peking University two years ago, his salary was only 280,000 yuan per month. In just over a year, it has increased to 12 million yuan. The adjustment has not been slow, but it still cannot solve the problem. The government should seriously consider the new method of universal distribution of goods in kind. Hu Shih brought a lot of relevant materials this time, which will be provided to the "supervisory authority" for reference. He also said: "Everyone must sit down and have a good talk." As for the source of goods in kind and how to implement an effective distribution method, Hu Shih believes that the government and experts should conduct thorough research.

When Will the Atomic Building Be Realized?

The reporter then visited Li Shuhua, who said: The Beiping Research Institute previously planned to build an atomic building in Beiping. All architectural drawings and atomic research plans have been drafted, but they have been shelved due to lack of funding. He sighed with emotion. In addition to attending the National Assembly and the Council Meeting of Academicians of the Central Research Institute, Li will also discuss with Li Shizeng the date of this autumn's academic conference of the Beiping Research Institute.

### Beiping Railway College Prepares to Establish a Museum

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 21st (Telegram)] The National Beiping Railway College is preparing to establish a transportation museum, which is being carried out by Professor Cheng Zhongyuan. The museum of the college before the July 7th Incident was destroyed by the Japanese army.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Report] In order to increase the efficiency of educational administration in Jiangsu Province, in addition to first restoring the education bureaus of Wu County, Wuxi, Wujin, Jiangyin, Songjiang, Jiangdu, Nantong, and Yixing, the education bureaus of Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Changshu, Taixian, Rugao, Gaoyou, and Tongshan will be restored in stages this year, as well as those of Dongtai, Yancheng, Huaian, Huaiyin, Lianshui, Funing, Donghai, Guanyun, and Taixing. It is expected that this will be completed by September of this year. Plans are currently being made to determine the budget for the education bureaus, set the staffing standards for the education bureaus, and revise the operating rules for the education bureaus.

### Government Decides to Allocate 800 Billion to Fund Universal Education; Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu Officially Announces

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu recently stated that the government has decided to allocate 800 billion yuan to fund universal education. Hang pointed out that the government has long recognized the importance of universal education, and therefore, despite difficult wartime financial circumstances, still engaged in a five-year literacy campaign. From 1940 to 1944, the number of literate adults nationwide increased from 100 million to approximately 161 million, an increase of 60%. The number of literate school-age children increased from 13 million to 16 million, an increase of approximately 30%. He used the phrase "Education for Democracy" to explain the aim of future constitutional governments to strive for universal education. He also stated that the universal education plan will include reducing illiteracy, popularizing science, and training good citizens.

### UN Education Organization to Elect New Secretary-General; Hope Hu Shih and Y. C. James Yen Will Participate in the Election

Dr. Kuo Yu-shou Reveals Opinions of British and American Figures

[Special Dispatch from Paris, 12th] The Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will be up for re-election this year. Relevant British and American figures greatly hope that one of the two Chinese figures, Hu Shih and Y. C. James Yen, will come forward to participate in the election. Dr. Kuo Yu-shou reported this exciting news to Chinese residents in France today. Dr. Kuo stated: If we can mobilize early at home and abroad, and work separately, then Mr. Hu or Mr. Yen has a great chance of success. Dr. Kuo Yu-shou made this announcement at the "Paris Commemoration Ceremony for the Death of the Founding Father of the Republic of China" held at the Chinese Embassy in France, led by Ambassador Chien Tai, who also introduced Dr. Kuo. Dr. Kuo also recounted the details of the Second UNESCO General Conference in Mexico. He then stated: Although there are five official languages of the United Nations, the so-called "working languages" of "UNESCO" are only English and French. During the conference in Mexico City last year, Hang Liwu requested that Chinese be formally listed as one of the working languages, while the United States, Central America, and South American countries strongly sought to add Spanish. This year's entire budget for UNESCO is US$7.6 million, and China's membership dues account for 7%, which should be US$500,000. However, there are currently only six Chinese staff members at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. Dr. Kuo also stated that Yugoslavia and Poland had previously had many objections to the implementation of UNESCO's work. The biggest difficulty currently facing UNESCO is the volatility of international politics, which often affects the League's work plans. For example, recently UNESCO planned to start work in Germany, but the Czech Republic and Poland firmly opposed it. How to prevent international politics from affecting the progress of UNESCO remains without concrete ideas.

### Cheeloo University Resumes Classes

They have telegraphed the Ministry of Education requesting a revision, but have not received a result. They have now urgently telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting an increase. According to general predictions, there is a good chance that they will follow the example of Wuhan University and be reclassified into the third district standard.

### General Commodity Prices Maintain Steady Trend at the Beginning of the Week; Violent Fluctuations Return on the Weekend

Last week was the fifth week after the Lunar New Year. The violence of the price fluctuations after the Lunar New Year is truly unprecedented. In terms of the magnitude of the price index increase during this price fluctuation cycle, only the price surge in the spring of 1946, with an increase of 120%, can be compared. However, that surge was due to the fact that factories that had moved inland during the war were still on their way back east after the victory. Production along the coast had not yet returned to normal, and the large number of people who had moved inland during the war were returning east, causing a rapid increase in consumption along the coast. At the same time, legal tender was flowing eastward from the interior in large quantities, creating a violent price surge. Although the increase in the general price index during that price fluctuation cycle was over 100%, it lasted for 12 weeks. This was a relatively exceptional fluctuation. Since then, there was another major fluctuation in the second half of 1946 and three major fluctuations in 1947. During these four major fluctuations, the percentage increase in the total price index ranged from 42% to 80%. The fluctuation cycle was shortened from 12 weeks to 6 weeks, and the interval between each two cycles gradually shortened from three months to five or six weeks. In the recent price increases over the short three weeks after the Lunar New Year, the total price index has already increased by more than 100%. By the previous week, the fourth week, food prices had fallen slightly, and fuel prices remained stable, but textiles continued to skyrocket, with no sign of entering a quiet period. Last week, prices mostly continued to skyrocket, as if this price fluctuation cycle had not yet ended. How much the total price index will increase during this cycle by the time it ends is still unknown. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in past price fluctuation cycles, and the severity of this phenomenon is indeed unprecedented. It is worthy of special attention from the financial authorities.

Looking back, how have the financial authorities responded to this serious situation? To encourage exports, the Joint Treasury of Four Banks drafted measures last week for export goods to settle foreign exchange loans. This, like production loans, will affect the loosening of credit. Because the import volume of industrial raw materials and production equipment within the allocated quota cannot meet the general needs of industry, last week, according to sources from the Ministry of Finance, the government has agreed in principle to allow the import of goods with self-provided foreign exchange in the short term. However, the foreign goods imported with this self-provided foreign exchange are limited to industrial production equipment. This decision is likely to stimulate the black market for foreign exchange. Furthermore, more than three months have passed since the establishment of the Yarn Control Committee, and the implementation measures for subcontracting and weaving have not yet been announced and implemented. However, the unified purchase and sale of raw cotton needed by yarn factories was implemented first, strictly prohibiting yarn factories from purchasing on their own, resulting in a daily shortage of cotton in yarn factories and creating a serious shortage of raw cotton. The above measures do not seem to have shown any practical effect on stabilizing prices. In particular, the price increase limit on the yarn and cloth market, which was only stipulated on Thursday that the daily increase should not exceed 5% of the previous day's closing price, was relaxed after only two days due to the fact that it was impossible to implement in practice. Given the current situation of dwindling raw cotton reserves, the violence of the yarn and cloth price surge is unlikely to be contained by such rigid regulations from the government. Furthermore, the Joint Treasury of Four Banks passed a resolution last week to raise deposit interest rates to stabilize prices. Whether this measure can achieve the expected results is also questionable. According to the theories of Swedish economists such as Wicksell, in order to maintain price stability, the market interest rate should be raised to the level of the so-called equilibrium interest rate or neutral interest rate. There is no doubt that the current deposit interest rate is far below Wicksell's equilibrium interest rate. However, in a state of inflation, the equilibrium interest rate is a variable number. If deposit interest rates are raised to stabilize prices, the result may be similar to the meager effect of raising the exchange rate in order to eliminate the foreign exchange black market. The result may be that the higher the deposit interest rate, the faster the price surge, that is, the higher the equilibrium interest rate. The former will ultimately not be able to catch up with the latter. Moreover, the current equilibrium interest rate has exceeded 100% per month, and the deposit interest rate cannot be raised to such a high level. Therefore, all of the above measures are worth re-examining.

Last week, because the price increases in this city the previous week were too large, far exceeding those in the interior, speculative funds flowed inland in large quantities to purchase goods, mostly to Hankou, Chongqing, and Kunming. This point can be seen from the increase in exchange rates in the above-mentioned places. Credit in this city was tight last week, with a net outflow of 610 billion, an unusually high peak. Food prices fell even more sharply after the decline at the end of the previous week. However, buying sentiment in the yarn and cloth market rebounded, and prices rose again. The tight situation did not ease on Tuesday and Wednesday, and food prices fell again. Yarn and cloth declined slightly on Tuesday, but the tight situation eased slightly on Wednesday afternoon, and yarn and cloth rose again. Since then, whether it was food, yarn and cloth, rayon, or factory supplies, all hit new highs daily. The weekend saw even more frantic price increases, and the above-mentioned goods markets were all in a state of frenzy. White rice rose from 3.145 million per shi at the end of the previous week to 4.15 million at the end of last week. Retail prices even reached 4.4 million. Navy wheat flour rose from 1.43 million per bag at the end of the previous week to 1.59 million last week. The most frantic price increases were in yarn and cloth. During the same period, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose from 177 million to 227 million, and Longtou fine cloth rose from 3.39 million per yard to 4.4 million. However, because prices were lower at the beginning and middle of the week, the price index for last week did not increase much compared to the previous week, and the food index actually fell. The reason is that the price index compiled by this society only includes the five days from Monday to Friday and does not include Saturday due to time constraints. Other commodities, such as coal, were most stable in price because the weather was warmer and demand decreased. Jiaozuo Po coal was stable at around 13 million per ton. 693 sulfuric acid was also stable in price at around 52 million yuan per barrel due to seasonal factors and lower demand. However, the prices of most chemicals generally increased significantly.

### Currency and Finance: Capital Flows in but Credit Remains Tight; Reduced Inflow and Continued Rise in Shadow Interest Rates

Last week, the city's credit situation could have eased with the inflow of exchange difference from national banks and the continuous arrival of floating capital from other regions. However, the rising price trend, stimulated by various factors, remained relentless. Even the grain prices, which had barely stabilized for three or four days, rose again. The rumor that yarn factories would soon run out of raw cotton caused cotton cloth to rise even more sharply. Those short on goods scrambled to borrow funds to buy, while sellers preferred to bear high interest rates and raise prices drastically. As a result, general prices did not fall due to the tight credit, and the continued rise in prices, in turn, tightened credit further and made funds even scarcer. The influx of floating capital and the reduction of inflows from national banks did slightly alleviate the dry situation in the market. However, commercial firms generally lacked orders throughout the week, and the daily amount of cash delivered to the Central Bank to offset orders was only several hundred billion, except for over one hundred billion on Monday. Interbank lending was also not easy. The increase in bounced checks in the clearinghouse could temporarily alleviate the predicament, but it was not a permanent solution. Therefore, it was necessary to seek assistance from sporadic funds outside the industry. As a result, the shadow interest rate hovered above 30%, remaining high for a long time. Securities arbitrage also remained at a high level of 30%. On Friday, the interest rate difference between long and short positions in securities reached an unprecedentedly high of 39%.

Last week, the exchange difference of national banks was relatively large only on Monday, with an inflow of 446.9 billion. The interbank inflow on Tuesday was only 28.5 billion, which was insignificant. From Wednesday to Friday, after deducting commercial banks' fixed deposits at the Central Bank, there was a real outflow of more than 10 billion each day. This was significantly different from the inflow situation of national banks in the previous two weeks. Although the inflow amount of national banks decreased, the total outflow of commercial banks' indirect exchange groups remained around 1.5 trillion, indicating the tightness of credit. As for foreign banks' exchange situation last week, except for Tuesday, when there was an outflow of 58.5 billion, setting a record for outflows since February, there were large inflows on other days. The inflow amount from Wednesday to Friday was 120 to 130 billion per day. It is said that the outflow of capital to the south is still intense.

Internal and External Exchange Rates

Last week, the exchange rate for foreign currencies saw the base rate rise again on Wednesday, with the US dollar fixed at 255,000 national currency units, an increase of about 30%. The exchange rate between British and American currencies remained unchanged, with the British pound at 765,000 national currency units. The Hong Kong exchange rate also continued to shrink. On Monday, 100,000 legal tender units were equal to HK$1.22, which shrank to HK$1.13 on Thursday. The market price of US dollars was HK$5.77 on Monday, shrinking to around HK$5.56 on Thursday. Last week, the internal exchange rate of commercial banks in this city fluctuated significantly. The Guangzhou exchange rate was 200 units per 1,000 on Monday, and 280 units on Friday. The Xiamen exchange rate was 200 units on Monday, rising to 300 units on Thursday and Friday. The Hankou exchange rate also rose from 90 units on Monday to 120 units on Wednesday and Thursday. The Chongqing exchange rate was highest at 70 units on Tuesday and lowest at 40 units on Thursday. Generally speaking, the exchange rates in various places showed an upward trend, mainly due to the continued outflow of capital to the south and the reduced discount rate of the Shanghai exchange rate in various places. The discount rate of the Tianjin exchange rate increased significantly last week, which may be related to the outflow of floating capital from the north to the south.

Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

Last week, the Chinese stock market was indeed affected by the tight credit situation, but due to the influx of floating capital and apparent buying interest, the general trend was still positive. For example, on Monday, although national banks had a huge inflow difference, nine stocks, including China Cement, still reached the limit. In addition, the continued shrinkage of the Hong Kong exchange rate and the sharp rise in yarn prices also provided new stimulus to Chinese stocks. For example, Yongxing Yarn closed at 1,428 yuan at the end of the previous week, and the closing price at the end of last week was 1,860 yuan, an increase of about 30%. The increase rates of Jingfu and Jinglun during the same period were also about 30%, while Xin Guang was 20%. Large stocks such as Mei Ya closed at 3,400 yuan on Friday last week, also up nearly 30% compared to the closing price at the end of the previous week.

The performance of foreign stocks last week was not as good as that of Chinese stocks. It is said that because the price difference between Hong Kong and local counters was very large, many stocks were shipped to the local market for sale, resulting in lower local prices. For example, Yishun closed at 1.85 million at the end of the previous week and 1.96 million at the end of last week, an increase of about 6%. The increase rates of other Yishun, British-American Tobacco, and Jardine Matheson during the same period were all below 5%, which was significantly different from the increase rate in the previous week.

### Industrial and Commercial Trends

Raw Material "Panic"

In today's generally declining industrial landscape, the textile industry can still be considered to maintain a small-scale prosperity. However, with the passage of time, the industry has also fallen into a predicament surrounded by enemies on all sides! As everyone knows, the Japanese textile industry, with the generous support of the United States, has already made strides in reconstruction. To this end, the Chinese Textile Institute convened a symposium on the 11th of this month specifically to discuss the "US Support for the Japanese Textile Industry" issue. The conclusion was that the reconstruction of the Japanese textile industry should be limited to 3.5 million spindles to meet its domestic needs. At the same time, it was believed that the Chinese government should encourage the profits earned by the textile industry to be used extensively for the construction and development of the textile industry. Limiting oneself to fiscal revenue alone would be akin to killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. However, the fact has become very obvious that "the US disregards the future of the Chinese national industry" and it is "one of its current national policies." According to a New Asia News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 16th, the Osaka Textile Industry Association held a meeting with the Cotton Fabric Industry Alliance to discuss the production plan for this year's export of cotton cloth. It was decided that the production target for this year would be 955,510,700 yards. It is understood that China is also included among the destinations for sales in Asia. Therefore, the focus of hope has to be placed on "self-reliance." However, in the past week, the delayed implementation of substituting weaving for spinning has caused an extreme panic in the textile industry regarding raw materials. The Six District Cotton Spinning Association and the National Textile Industry Federation have convened meetings one after another to discuss countermeasures. It is understood that the raw cotton stored in various factories in this city is, at most, enough for two months, and at least only enough for two or three weeks. According to a certain authority in the textile industry, if this situation is not dealt with quickly, various factories may have to stop production. The yarn factories in this city employ about 90,000 people, and the related reproduction industry and hardware industry employ a considerable number of people. Once the yarn factories stop production, it will have a serious impact on public order. According to him, the current sharp rise in yarn prices is also due to the depletion of cotton in the yarn factories, leading to a rush purchase by people outside the industry. In addition, the cotton spinning industry is calling on the authorities to immediately exchange yarn with foreign countries for 200,000 bales of Indian cotton, otherwise the Six District Association will handle it automatically, because the Indian government has announced a ban on the export of Indian cotton starting at the end of March. Indeed, the problem has reached a point where it must be solved. The difficult situation is very common in every corner. In addition to the cotton spinning industry, the National Cement Industry Association has also called on the government to provide full assistance to expand cement exports. It is understood that under the current exchange rate, the price sold abroad, when converted to legal tender, is not even half of the cost. Taking the situation in the Philippines as an example, American cement in paper bags of 50 kilograms sells for US$2, which, when settled at the latest exchange rate, yields only 390,000 national currency units. However, the current cost of domestic exports is 550,000 units per bag, plus insurance, loading, unloading, and the huge transportation costs between Shanghai and the Philippines, making it impossible to compete with others. Therefore, the industry requests that all foreign exchange earned from cement exports should be allocated to export manufacturers for the purchase of equipment and raw materials such as gypsum paper bags. This request coincides with the rumored opening of the self-provided foreign exchange issue. Furthermore, it is said that the Export Control Committee's plan to use self-provided foreign exchange to purchase production equipment is entirely aimed at increasing domestic production and not stimulating the black market. All general foreign private funds, domestic private foreign currency, and gold are not the targets of opening up. Then "this matter is very complicated," and if the authorities slightly restrain their desire to obtain foreign exchange funds, it may not be difficult to "carefully study" and "reach an agreement"!

The prices of industrial products have seen soap prices increase unprecedentedly in the past week, in addition to the alarming rise in cotton yarn and cloth. According to the Four District Soap Industry Association, there are two reasons for the sharp rise in soap prices: one is the soaring price of raw materials. For example, tallow was 4 million per dan at the end of the lunar year last year, and now it exceeds 16 million, an increase of more than four times. At the same time, there are rumors that the quota for oil and wax in the fourth quarter will be reduced. Coconut oil has also skyrocketed, from 6 million per dan at the end of the lunar year to 23 million to date. The second reason is the difficulty in capital turnover, resulting in shrinking production and reduced output, which naturally leads to a sharp rise in prices. Obviously, this is the same difficulty encountered by all industrial sectors. However, this difficulty cannot be solved by the circular formula of one thing rising in price because another thing also rises in price. In other words, the universal rise in prices cannot be achieved by universally stabilizing prices.

"Acquisition" of Tung Oil

Regarding the acquisition of export materials, the targets were originally limited to seven important items, including tung oil, pig bristles, raw silk, soybeans, eggs, and wool. Last week, tung oil was tried out first. It is said that because the foreign price of tung oil has fallen sharply, it has reached a point where it must be acquired. The Appraisal Committee for the Acquisition of Important Export Materials was established on the 13th. The acquisition areas are limited to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou, and it is stipulated that acquisitions will not be made in the interior to avoid competing with merchants for profits. It is understood that the China Trust Bureau has acquired 300 tons of tung oil applied for by exporters. According to a spokesperson for the China Trust Bureau, the implementation of this method can help export materials to be sold in large quantities overseas without being restricted by the foreign exchange rate.

In addition, in order to cooperate with the authorities' measures to encourage manufacturers to export, ten domestic product manufacturers in this city have jointly established an export organization to promote exports. Naturally, manufacturers are working hard. Under the predicament of domestic raw material shortages, soaring production costs, and sharply reduced output and output, it is not a small compensation if they can find a way out in the foreign market. However, what is the actual effect of the various measures taken by the authorities and manufacturers? Opinions vary, and there are many different views. According to the general manager of HSBC, although China's overseas trade is under control, it is doubtful whether encouraging exports and reducing imports will be effective due to inflation.

The "Mission" of Agricultural Loans

Whether industrial loans will be opened is still uncertain, but agricultural loans have already taken concrete shape, and in terms of quantity, the latter also has the upper hand. According to Director Qiao of the Agricultural Loan Department of the Agricultural Bank, this year's grain loan is 5 trillion and the cotton loan is 3 trillion, accounting for 60% of the total loan amount. It is said that although this number is huge, it is impossible to achieve universality given the vastness of our land. Therefore, this year, a focus principle will be adopted, and centralized management is planned. Regarding the future achievements of agricultural loans, Qiao一再强调要健全农工组织，农贷始能得受实惠。It is repeatedly emphasized that in order to ensure the benefits of agricultural loans, it is necessary to improve peasant organizations. Agricultural loans are aimed at farmers, but it is said that farmers lack organization and funds cannot be released. Therefore, it is necessary to go through cooperatives and rural farmers' associations. Farmers must first join cooperatives as members or join rural farmers' associations before they can be granted loans.

At the same time, in order to avoid conflicts between branches of the China Farmers Bank and cooperative treasuries in various places, agricultural loan areas will be dominated by the Farmers Bank, and cooperative treasuries will supplement areas where loans cannot be granted. Furthermore, in the same area, if there are institutions of both the China Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Treasury, they will still divide their spheres of influence. That is, loan related to cooperation will be handled by the Central Cooperative Treasury, and cooperative loans clearly stipulated in this year's agricultural loan plan will also be the responsibility of the Central Cooperative Treasury. In addition, on the 19th of this month, in order to review the past and plan for the future, the China Farmers Bank held a bank affairs meeting, and Chairman Chen Guofu and others spoke, believing that agricultural loan work has the responsibility of assisting the government in winning over the people. From this, it can be seen that this year's agricultural loans, which account for 60% of the total loan amount, have an extraordinary mission.

Industrial and Commercial Survey

### Production and Sales Problems of the Silk Weaving Industry

Our country's raw silk and silk fabrics have always been important export goods. Before the war, the export value of its export commodities often ranked first. The total export volume averaged 150,000 metric tons per year, valued at around 15 million legal currency, accounting for about 14% of the average total export value during the same period, which could offset about 10% of the average total import value during the same period. After the victory, because various factories suffered losses, they were unable to fully recover. Shanghai currently only has 391 silk weaving factories, with a total of more than 6,500 looms. If raw materials and funds can be fully supplied, the monthly output can reach 80,000 bolts. There is still concern that the raw silk produced domestically will be insufficient for weaving. Furthermore, the silk weaving factories have become accustomed to using rayon during the war, and it is difficult to reverse this trend in the short term. Last year, a small amount of rayon was imported from Japan. At the beginning of this year, more than 1,500 boxes were shipped from Italy, and silk weaving industries in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places all received allocations this week. However, due to the depreciation of currency and high costs, production is quite difficult. Recently, the Allied Headquarters decided to resume production in Japan. Japan has a large stock of raw materials. Rayon fabrics are both cheap and good, and are now being dumped in the New York market in the United States. The price of Japanese silk has been reduced from the current price of US$7.55 per pound to US$2.55 per pound, which has caused the American market to no longer consume expensive Chinese raw silk. The target of our country's silk transportation and sales was originally mainly the United States, but now it has been forced to switch to India. However, due to the high production costs in our country, only 5% of the silk shipped to Mumbai, India, has been sold, and the rest remains in Indian branches. In addition, the production of nylon in the United States after the war is also one of the reasons for reducing the need for our country's silk.

Recently, the government has implemented control over silk in order to manage foreign exchange. However, manufacturers are very dissatisfied, which has led to a decrease in production interest. The export volume of silk has decreased even further. The total export volume of raw silk and silk fabrics last year was 21,860.71 metric tons, with a total value of only 359,159,438,000 yuan, and its export value is far less than that of tung oil, pig bristles, and cotton fabrics. Furthermore, with the threat of war in North and East China, there are many plans to move south. As a result, the silk from Shunde, Guangdong, and other places has attracted the attention of the China Import and Export Corporation. The company not only plans to actively promote improved silkworm breeds, but also plans to set up silk weaving factories in Guangdong Province. At the same time, the silkworm seed loan from the Agricultural Bank of China also began to be processed this week, with a maximum monthly interest rate of 7% and a term of six months or nine months. It should be beneficial to the silk weaving industry. From this point of view, the silk weaving industry in the future may be centered in Guangdong Province, exporting to Hong Kong and Macau, and then transshipping to Europe and the United States for application. European countries such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are also our country's main consumption markets for silk.

### Glass in the Atomic Age

— Wang Chuanyi

In the early days of this World War II, military experts wanted to use glass to manufacture a transparent aircraft that could conceal enemies' ears and eyes. Although this plan was not realized, due to its special hardness, glass has been widely used in aircraft, automobiles, and prosthetics for the disabled, bulletproof vests, bandages required by surgeons, and fillings for cavities. Glass can also be manufactured into fertilizer. This newly advancing glass industry is emerging in various manufactured products at a rapid pace. A larger glass factory can produce 4,000 different types of glass for different uses.

Now is the Age of Glass

The uses of glass are becoming increasingly widespread, so American glass experts boast that after the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Steel Age, humans are now stepping into the Glass Age? At the Glass Improvement Association held at the University of Pittsburgh, its chairman, Dr. Alexander Silverman, predicted that in the next five years, the glass industry will become one of the most important light industries.

Glass can withstand atomic bombs

Dr. Silverman also made a surprising declaration that a special type of glass made from uranium, the raw material for atomic bombs, can withstand the terrible radiation emitted by atomic bombs. He said: "People in atomic bomb explosion areas can wear armor woven from this type of glass and wear a special air cylinder containing a high-frequency dust filter insulated with glass, which can prevent radioactive dust to protect the safety of life."

Glass and Plastics

A recent important invention in industry is the completion of the method of using glass fiber to enhance plastics. This is just like architects using steel bars to strengthen the firmness of concrete. This type of plastic reinforced with glass fiber contains many of the characteristics of metals. It is as light as aluminum and has the strength of the hardest metal we use today. Therefore, modern designers and engineers are competing to use it to manufacture aircraft fuselages, yachts, and various daily utensils. Artisans use this type of glass-reinforced plastic to replace the heat-insulating materials required for old buildings, because it contains heat-insulating properties. This type of plastic can also be used to manufacture lightweight bulletproof vests for soldiers. These bulletproof vests are far superior in performance to bulletproof vests made of metal, and soldiers call them "Doron." It can block 0.45 caliber bullets. For accuracy, this "Doron" is still being tested and improved in the jungles of Colombia.

New Uses of Glass Fiber

American military authorities have recently been experimenting with using glass fiber to weave an Arctic exploration suit that can withstand the cold climate below zero in the Arctic. According to the manufacturer's tests, this suit can maintain the original body temperature at minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Ground glass fiber can also be used as a strengthening agent for special paper to make gramophone records or added to pigments to improve their texture. Surgeons also use it to make wound sutures, special bandages, and plasma filters. Agronomists also predict that in the near future, a special glass fiber can be scattered as fertilizer. This matter is currently being experimented with by Dr. Alfred Badger and Dr. Roger H. Bray. This glass fiber contains the main nutrients of plants and can be dissolved in water and gradually dissolved in the soil to be absorbed by the roots of plants to maintain their life. We believe that soon glass will be widely used as a fertilizer.

Science not only tells us how to use glass to make various objects, but also tells us how to use various special coatings to improve the quality of old-fashioned glass. For example, coating it with a transparent, strong, and electrically conductive coating to make windshields for airplanes and cars, and this type of glass has the characteristic of not freezing. Glass was recognized as a usable material a long time ago, but glass as an important industry is still in its infancy.

### A New Method of Rust Prevention

— Translated by Gu Tonggao

Your tap water pipes are rusting, your copper wire screens are falling apart, your aluminum pots are fading, and your cutlery is turning dark...

While these may seem like minor personal issues, they are part of the larger problem of metal corrosion. This larger problem causes billions of dollars in losses each year.

It has been estimated that 40% of all steel produced since 1890 has been lost to rust. The two World Wars, with their unparalleled destructive power, were certainly a major factor in this enormous loss. We are all familiar with the image of piles and piles of war equipment abandoned and rusting away!

Recently, the scientific community has mobilized to attack this enemy of industry and progress. The Illinois Institute of Technology established a corrosion research laboratory in December 1944, and at that time it was the only such laboratory in the United States.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology had previously achieved some brilliant results in this field, but later ceased its work. However, it has now re-established a corrosion research laboratory, and Ohio State University and Lehigh University have also each established one, modeled to some extent on the Illinois Institute of Technology's plan.

In addition, the Case Institute of Technology, the University of Colorado, and the University of Texas are also in the process of establishing such laboratories.

The corrosion research laboratory at the Illinois Institute of Technology studies all kinds of metal corrosion, and today it has made valuable contributions to overcoming rust. Its director is Dr. Hugh J. McDonald, a professor of chemistry.

Why has the problem of preserving steel from rust received more attention only recently? Firstly, because the large quantities of war equipment stored by the U.S. government may soon be needed. Secondly, because the United States' high-quality iron ore, such as that from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota, is gradually being depleted.

We can say that most people consider the rusting of metal, especially steel, as a well-known example of a simple natural phenomenon, most likely to occur where moisture is present. But scientific research tells us that it is somewhat more complex. According to Dr. McDonald, the nature of rust is electrochemical.

He illustrates this by comparing it to the failure of an ordinary flashlight battery. The outer casing of the battery gradually corrodes. In this process, electrons flow from the corroding zinc casing to the external circuit and back to the carbon rod in the center of the battery. If a reverse current, slightly stronger than the battery's own, is applied to the battery, experiments have shown that the corrosion process stops.

Since rust is an electrochemical process, it can be prevented in metal just as it can be in a battery, simply by applying a current that opposes the natural current of the rusting metal. This principle has been known for over a century, but it has only recently been formally applied.

Today, one practical application of this principle can be seen in large oil pipelines. Their main enemy has always been rust. These pipelines now rely on electric current to protect their pipes from rust, intermittently using windmills or other power generation devices to produce current along the line.

Although the research at the Illinois Institute of Technology laboratory mainly deals with the corrosion of steel, the problems of other metals are also not ignored, especially the new light metals magnesium and magnesium alloys, because they rust easily.

The main methods used in this laboratory are:

(1) Altering the surface layer. This means making the surface of the metal more resistant than the metal itself. For example, treating aluminum with hot chromic acid.

Internal stress corrosion in steel is due to the presence of small amounts of nitrogen in the metal. Treating the metal surface with hydrogen saturated with water vapor can remove the nitrogen and prevent stress corrosion cracking.

(2) Rust inhibitors. Treating the medium, such as gasoline in pipes, with trace amounts of sodium nitrite can prevent or slow down the electrochemical process. Car radiators can be protected from rust with this compound, or sodium chromate can also be used. The method of rust prevention for the Grand Coulee Dam is to add a rust inhibitor (vitreous phosphate) to the water pipes each time the dam is closed.

The outstanding work of the Illinois Institute of Technology laboratory is the application of rust inhibitors and the study of soft steel internal stress corrosion cracking. Internal stress corrosion cracking is a particularly dangerous type of corrosion cracking, because there are rarely any signs of failure in the metal structure beforehand.

There is also a type of metal cracking caused by molecular separation in the structure, leading to deep corrosion. This is the most abhorrent type of corrosion—expensive, dangerous, and difficult to inspect. It is often the cause of boiler explosions.

Glenn A. Marsh has invented an instrument called the Pulse Polarizer, which uses an electric current to detect corrosion states in metal. This is a completely new method that takes only a fraction of the time compared to previously used methods.

### New Blood Type RH

— Xue Zhongxun

In 1900, Landsteiner discovered that when the red blood cells of certain people are placed in the serum of others, the red blood cells coagulate into clumps. This reaction only occurs when the red blood cells of a particular person are injected into the serum of a particular other person. After careful research, Landsteiner discovered that there are two independent antigens (Agglutinogen or Antigen), contained in red blood cells, which can cause coagulation when they encounter antibodies (Agglutinin or Antibody) in the serum of others.

In 1901, Landsteiner divided human blood types into three types. Decastello and Stutli pointed out in 1902 that blood type AB is also a type of blood type. In 1907, Jansky, and in 1910, Moss, divided blood types into four categories, namely O, A, B, and AB. Those with antigen A are blood type A; those with antigen B are blood type B; those with both antigens A and B are blood type AB; and those without any antigens are blood type O. People with blood type A do not have antibodies that agglutinate A red blood cells, but they do have antibodies that agglutinate blood type B. People with blood type B do not have antibodies that agglutinate B red blood cells, but they do have antibodies that agglutinate blood type A. People with blood type AB lack both antibodies. People with blood type O have both antibodies simultaneously. The relationship between antigens and antibodies in each blood type is shown in the table below.

Blood type  Antigens in red blood cells Antibodies in serum

O O 2+B

A A B (Anti-B)

B B 2 (Anti-A)

AB A+B None

In terms of genetics, blood type is a multiple alleles. The blood type of children can be calculated from the blood type of their parents. The genotype of each blood type is as follows:

Blood type Genotype

O aa

A AA (or Aa)

B aBaB (or aaB)

AB AaB

The above four blood types are known to ordinary people. In 1940, Landsteiner and Weiner discovered a new blood type. After repeatedly injecting the blood of rhesus monkeys into rabbits and guinea pigs, an immune serum was obtained. This serum can also cause a coagulation reaction with our red blood cells. This new factor has been called Rh since 1941. Tests on 480 Caucasians found that 85% had Rh, and only 15% showed negative results. In 1941, Levine, Vogel, Katzin, and Burnham conducted a large-scale test on 1,035 people, and only 14% showed negative results. Among 113 black people, only 9 showed Rh-negative reactions, which is approximately 8%. In 1942, Landsteiner, Weiner, and Matson tested American Indians in Washington state and its vicinity. Among 120 people, only one showed an Rh-negative reaction. In fact, every red person has an Rh gene).

Regarding the inheritance of Rh blood types, tests were conducted on 237 children in 60 Caucasian families, and it was found that Rh is dominant. Therefore, in terms of this blood type, the genotype can be divided into three categories: RhRh, Rhrh, and rhrh. Race, Taylor, Cappell, and McFarlane pointed out in 1944 that there are seven Rh alleles: Rho, Rhl, Rh2, Rh', Rh", and Rhy.

Because the Rh blood type antigen can cause an antibody in someone's serum to agglutinate red blood cells, doctors should pay close attention to this point when transfusing blood.

### New Methods for Preventing Pests

— Zhou Guangyu

Farmers who work hard all year round, under the intertwined circumstances of various disasters and oppressions, have a painful experience: the longer they cultivate, the more they have to contend with more pests. Even with hundreds of time-honored and novel insecticides, they have not been freed from their suffering, so some experts have had to seek alternative solutions outside of insecticide use.

The Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station in the United States recently discovered a direct relationship between insect numbers and soil fertility—the lower the fertility, the more insects there are. Crops grown in improperly cultivated soil that has been eroded of its fertility and lacks certain important nutrients are of little nutritional value to humans and livestock, but are extremely attractive to insects, and insects find such crops to be an ideal food source for breeding. This phenomenon, when compared to the fact that feed produced in fertile soil can only be used to make excellent livestock rations, is somewhat absurd, but it is an undeniable fact.

Insects do not respond to vitamins or other health-sustaining factors in feed in the same way as higher animals. Each insect has its own special nutritional needs. If insects growing in sawdust are forced to eat nutritious meat or fruit, they will starve to death. Even among aphids, one type requires food rich in nitrogen, while another cannot live without carbohydrates.

Based on these revelations, recent research by experts in soil conditions and insects has led to a new offensive against major crop pests. Take the chinch bug, which infests corn, as an example. Ever since agriculture began to develop in the Mississippi Basin in 1850, a serious disaster has occurred every ten years or so. If you were to inspect the cornfields during a summer of infestation, you would see that the most severely affected areas are on the eroded and infertile upper slopes—the corn stalks in that area are covered with chinch bugs, making them both red and black. At the foot of the mountain, where soil fertility is extremely high due to the accumulation of nitrogen and other soil elements washed down, the corn is mostly robust and full of vitality, with chinch bugs attached only to a few weak stems. Previously, many people explained this phenomenon by saying that chinch bugs prefer sunlight and dryness. In fact, the hot midday sun is no more attractive to them than it is to other insects. They often have to hide in the shade to forage. In severe summers, they only start crawling when the sun is obscured or slightly cooler. Similarly, in winter, they often hide in the grass and spend the harsh winter immersed in the frost. From this perspective, the reason why there are so many chinch bugs on decaying corn is not due to excessive sunlight or lack of moisture, but because the sap of that corn is more palatable to them than that of the robust corn at the foot of the mountain.

Chinch bugs often climb onto other crops via nitrogen-rich leguminous plants, which clearly proves that they dislike nitrogen. Therefore, Dr. Stone and L. Haseman in the United States conducted an experiment based on this phenomenon to observe whether increasing nitrogen could prevent chinch bugs. First, an experiment was started on the effect of nitrogen content on chinch bugs, planting corn in nutrient-free sand, moistened with distilled water, and removing the tassels to prevent the absorption of nitrogen and other nutrients from the plant. Then, this detasseled corn was divided into two groups and transplanted into sand moistened with nutrient solutions, one group with a nutrient solution rich in nitrogen and the other group with a nutrient solution without nitrogen. When the corn was growing normally, it was dug up, cut into small sections, and fed to newly hatched chinch bugs. The results showed that those fed with nitrogen-free corn grew vigorously from hatching to old age, matured extremely quickly, and produced a large number of eggs. In the high-nitrogen group, it was difficult to find enough offspring to continue the experiment. This experiment can explain why the reproduction of chinch bugs becomes more vigorous when the source of nitrogen is reduced due to excavation or erosion of the land. At the same time, we can be sure that only by strengthening the lost soil fertility—especially nitrogen—can this pest be prevented.

So far, they have only conducted research on the relationship between chinch bugs and one soil element. The effect of calcium on common greenhouse pasture insects is also being prepared for experimentation. Other examples we have seen in other areas, such as wood borers only infesting weak or dying trees, or cattle lice concentrating on weak and poorly nourished livestock, may also have similar situations.

On the other hand, there is a fact that contradicts this: certain pests (such as the European corn borer) pose a greater threat to crops grown in fertile soil, seemingly refuting the previous experiment and making people believe that applying organic fertilizers to the soil is actually beneficial to pests. However, we should be able to find that there must be a lack of a certain element in this type of soil, or that this consequence is caused by an imbalance of various elements.

When the nutrients in the soil have been exhausted, if we continue to cultivate, the resulting crops that are useless to humans and livestock will promote the occurrence of extremely serious pest infestations in the future. To overcome this vicious cycle, we should quickly restore the fertility of the soil. Only in this way can we more effectively prevent pests without dedicating ourselves to the chemical warfare against pests.

### The Miracle of Paper

— Shao Yin

What is paper? This is such a bland and meaningless question! You will surely laugh and find the question somewhat foolish. Just pick up a newspaper or the letter paper you are writing on, and you can answer it. But the development of science has led to many miracles of paper, which you may not all know. Let me briefly mention them here.

Speaking of the characteristics of paper, everyone will think of its softness and thinness. It will burn when it encounters fire, it will become fragments when it touches water, it will have creases when it is rolled, and it can be pierced with the flick of a finger. But the facts are not always the case. There is a strange house in Appleton, Wisconsin, in the United States. After the onslaught of summer storms and the erosion of three winter winds, it still stands tall. The house is made entirely of paper. The floors, walls, and roof are all made of paper.

A grain merchant in the Midwestern United States said that once a rainstorm broke the roof of his warehouse, and rainwater immediately seeped into hundreds of bags of grain in paper bags. But as a result, the food inside the paper bags did not get wet at all.

Do you think paper is thin? Think about the houses in Wisconsin? Think about those paper airplanes that fly four hundred miles per hour.

Do you think paper is easy to burn? Now even ashtrays are made of paper.

Do you think paper cannot touch water? Think about the paper bags in the grain merchant's warehouse!

Paper scholars declare that the time when we wear paper clothes, use paper plates, paper carpets, paper quilts, and live in paper houses is not far away.

Some of these new products are already available on the market, and they sell very well, because paper is, after all, a cheap thing. Its main raw materials are various closely intertwined fibers, such as trees, cotton pods, flax buds, tobacco roots, hemp, rice straw, and certain clays.

Usually, children's bibs are also made of paper. Those paper bibs can absorb water and are very cheap. They can be thrown away after one use. There are also paper napkins supplied to housewives, which are very practical. They are soft, non-flammable, and washable.

Non-flammable paper is another modern miracle. Light a match on non-flammable paper, and it will scorch a little, but it will never burn. Many non-flammable papers were manufactured during the war to suit military use. The cost of manufacturing non-flammable paper is more expensive than ordinary paper, and the degree of its fire resistance is the standard for how expensive it is. Ordinary non-flammable window curtains are cheaper, non-flammable paper for building houses is more expensive, and paper used for clothing is the most expensive, and its fire resistance is exactly the same as ordinary fabrics.

Replacing cloth with paper is a product in the process of achieving perfect paper clothing. Paper sheets, paper pillowcases, and paper blankets will soon emerge. In fact, there is already a paper blanket for picnics on the market. This paper blanket can also be used as a children's mat and car seat cushion.

Replacing cloth with paper may bring about a reform in dressing habits. It can be used as a shirt to be worn only once, and men's socks (even the most optimistic paper manufacturers do not believe that women will give up Nylon) as well as children's tights.

In the future, paper raincoats, paper hats, and paper galoshes will also be discovered when it rains. Cheap paper coats, which can be discarded after use, will be the most popular among racers and masseurs!

There is now a paper diaper, which is suitable for people to use when traveling with children. Therefore, paper manufacturers are working hard to produce a soft and durable paper diaper, and most importantly, to make it cheap.

In the future, you don't have to worry about the harassment of flies and mosquitoes. Just use a wallpaper containing DDT material, and you can keep your room safe for two years. At the same time, DDT paper can also be used to wrap blankets and clothes to prevent insect infestations.

If someone tells you that fourteen people weighing two hundred pounds are standing on a piece of paper placed on two chairs, you will definitely laugh at him. But in fact, a thin sheet (Lamination) made of many pieces of glued paper has indeed undergone this test. During the war, the development of this thin sheet reached its peak.

Due to the lack of metal, military product manufacturers tried to use paper as the material for airplanes. This seems like an absurd idea, but in fact, every square inch of the sheet can generate 28,000 to 35,000 pounds of tension. With this huge tension, the sheet can also be competent as an airplane material.

In peacetime, thin sheets are very suitable for use as building materials, because its weight is half that of aluminum and less than one-fifth that of steel. In recent years, the advent of paper pipes has also greatly increased the value of paper.

If you want to understand the development process and trend of paper, you can go to the paper chemical factory in Appleton, USA. This is a large institution jointly run by one hundred paper companies, with thousands of scientists inside, exploring new uses of paper day and night.

Three years ago, after the newspapers reported on their first paper house, letters from all over the world were sent to the paper chemical factory to inquire. Some curious people even went to visit it in person. This paper house is most suitable for campers and hunters to purchase, because it is very small and light to use. Its weight is only a few hundred pounds, which is very convenient to transport in a car, and it is also very easy to disassemble, which only takes one or two hours.

Twenty years ago, the average American family used one-eighth of a ton of paper per year. In 1946, it increased to two-thirds of a ton. Ten years later, it will probably exceed one ton. Looking at the current shortage of paper, some people are also worried about the future supply of paper, but the paper industry has grasped this point and has already increased production.

Paper is truly a strange thing. With the progress of science, in a blink of an eye, the once popular glass world may be replaced by the paper world. This is really good news for the poor who want to live more comfortably, because it is not wasteful and very practical!

### On "Seeing the Big in the Small"

— Xuan Xuan

Recently, there has been a trend where, whether writing a news item or portraying a person, there is a fondness for focusing on the private life of the subject, writing extensively about minor details. News or articles written in this way are "interesting" and "lively," but they are prone to causing erroneous impressions, either losing the author's original intent or distorting the subject being written about.

In its 25th anniversary issue, the American weekly "Time" magazine discussed that one of the greatest features of its news writing style is its emphasis on "human interest." The reason given was: "A person, in a casual conversation, can sometimes reveal their true intentions more than in grand speeches and writings."

It specifically cited an example to illustrate this point, saying that the amount of writing describing Roosevelt's character in the past fifteen years is innumerable, but the best writing was still the story cited by the magazine in 1933 when Roosevelt first entered the White House. At that time, Mrs. Roosevelt had told a "Time" reporter: "Franklin (Roosevelt's nickname) really likes to give orders to his companions, and the companions are willing to be directed by him. Once I said to him, 'Son, don't always give orders to people, sometimes let others give orders too.' He replied, 'Mom, if I don't give orders, there's nothing fun.'" This personality, those close to him called it "determined," and enemies regarded it as "dictatorial," and "Time" magazine believed that this story best represents both sides of Roosevelt's personality.

This statement from "Time" magazine is actually wrong. Using Roosevelt's great achievements to explain this story is understandable, but using this story to explain Roosevelt's great achievements is pure nonsense. Just like fortune tellers who travel around, "knowing the past" is often quite accurate to about sixty percent, but "knowing the future" is completely absurd. After serving four terms as president, it is easy to find some beautiful stories from his childhood, but to "see the big in the small," to use this example to understand that, is missing the mark by a mile.

"Seeing a world from one person," the world will never be seen clearly. Seeing a person from the world, then the characters are all within it. Therefore, Molotov sneezing has nothing to do with the future of the United Nations meeting, and Marshall casually saying something unfavorable to A does not necessarily benefit B. The overall situation should be viewed from a broad perspective, and it cannot be judged by trivial details.

The "human interest" in the news reporter's pen is just a technique to attract readers, and it is not worthy of emulation.

### A Record of Falling Phoenix Slope

— Long Xiang

On March 10th, the Free Talk section carried Mr. Wang Baili's article "Falling Phoenix Slope." This reminded me of a previous visit to that place, so I will cautiously describe what I remember. (At the time, I was young and had no subjective or in-depth opinions or research, merely recording what I saw and heard. Errors are inevitable.) I will briefly describe it below, hoping to add to Mr. Wang's article and requesting correction!

In the autumn of the twenty-ninth year [of the Republic], I was a guest in Guanghan County, Sichuan. (Guanghan is the former Zhui County from the Three Kingdoms period, located ninety li north of Chengdu on the vital Sichuan-Shaanxi highway.) I had long heard of the famous historical sites along the Sichuan-Shaanxi road, such as the Golden Goose Bridge near Guanghan, Falling Phoenix Slope between Deyang and Luojiang, the cypress tree planted by Zhang Fei in Zitong, and the Jianmen Pass in Jiange. I secretly admired them. One day, I had a ride to Luojiang, so I took the opportunity to visit Falling Phoenix Slope first. It was late autumn, and the mountains were mostly bare, with red leaves everywhere. The branches and leaves were sparse, and the setting sun added to the desolate scene. Before reaching Falling Phoenix Slope, the road turned northwest. We abandoned the car and walked, finding a small path between the mountains. We climbed the steps, the path being rugged and winding, truly a strategic location. Halfway up the slope was a stone fortress named Baima (White Horse), likely White Horse Pass. Looking up at the mountaintop, clusters of verdant pine trees added interest to the autumn scenery. The Pang Gong Shrine, nestled among the pines, with its eaves visible, filled me with excitement.

Upon reaching the temple, the architecture was not particularly grand. Two or three families lived on either side, each with a thatched shed for incense and candles in front of their doors, adding to the desolate atmosphere. Several Taoists, hearing of our arrival, diligently greeted us. Entering the hall, the shrine of the Phoenix Chick (Pang Tong) was there, with a dark face and many whiskers, not resembling a refined scholar. The two corridors were lined with statues of generals who entered Sichuan with him, but they were half-ruined! I was inspired and briefly strolled around before taking my leave.

Behind the temple was a stone path leading to Luojiang. The mountain slope was gentler, and a stone tablet stood beside the path, with the three characters "Falling Phoenix Slope" written in official script. It seemed to be newly erected by later generations, and weeds were already engulfing it! Crows were calling out as dusk approached, and withered grass faced the setting sun. I could not help but feel a sense of desolation as I paid my respects to this hero of an era!

As far as I know, Falling Phoenix Slope does indeed have its site and belongs to Luojiang County. The Complete Library in Four Sections, Shu Zhong Guang Ji Mingsheng Ninth (North Sichuan Road) also records: "The Universal Geography records that Luojiang County was originally Fudi of Guanghan. The Jin Dynasty moved to Chanting due to Li Xiong's rebellion. The current city is it. Ten li southwest is White Horse Pass, facing Deer Head Pass. The record says that the mountaintop is flat with a small path for vehicles. During the Three Kingdoms period, it was a military camp. Among them is named Falling Phoenix Slope. According to legend, Mr. Phoenix, Pang Shiyuan, served Zhao Lie and died here under stray arrows. (Note 1 omitted)" Also, the Jiaqing Revised Unified Records states: "Pang Gong Shrine is located ten li south of Luojiang County at White Horse Pass, where Pang Tong is enshrined." I wonder if this is where Mr. Wang was referring to? I have added the above for experts to correct. [Note: According to the Biography of Pang Tong in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Shu Zhi: "Advancing to Huikou County, Tong led the troops to attack the city and was struck by stray arrows." It seems that Tong died in Wei (i.e., Guanghan). I don't know which is correct? I believe that Tong died at Falling Phoenix Slope is more credible. Since he died in Wei, he would not have been buried far away at Falling Phoenix Slope. I venture to say this to seek correction from wise men.]

### Inspiration from a Tie

— Jin Jin

I recently bought a tie, entirely by chance. A few days ago, I was passing by the Cathay Theater on Linsen Middle Road for some business. A long row of ties displayed in the window of a department store, with unique styles and vibrant colors, caught my eye. At the time, I seemed to think it was too expensive, so I only glanced at it and had no intention of buying it. After returning, I forgot about it.

These past two days, I received a稿酬 from a magazine, and since I had no other immediate use for it, I visited that department store again. Coincidentally, the store was holding a 10% discount sale on silk ties. I painstakingly chose one from a pile of colorful ties. After asking the clerk to waive the last 25,000 yuan, I happily bought it and took it home.

At the time, why I chose that particular tie was largely due to my intuition and subconscious. When I got home, opened the package, and looked closely, I felt that the tie's design, color scheme, cut, and material were truly pleasing. Its pattern included small squares, circles, narrow stripes, and triangles, arranged in a harmonious manner, not a chaotic mess. Its colors were red, yellow, white, and blue, and it was dotted with many silver flecks. The inside of the tie was lined with wool and white silk. If I may put it abstractly, it seemed to symbolize the kaleidoscope-like life of its maker's country.

I suddenly gained some inspiration from this tie. Why didn't I choose another plain tie that was displayed next to it and priced one-third cheaper? I think there is a reason. Most people like complexity and dislike simplicity. They dislike the ordinary and love the extraordinary. This tie's difference from the ties on the market touched my heart.

I was reminded of something that the American writer John Dos Passos mentioned in one of his short essays: that mankind's lowest desires must be free from the fear of cold and hunger. However, due to mankind's love of complexity, after having enough to eat and wear, they still hope to eat well and dress stylishly.

Not only that, but the things that people like extend in many directions, like a large octopus, capturing the things it welcomes. Generally, people are not satisfied with sensory pleasures, as well as achievements in science, art, and culture. They have love, ambition, a sense of justice, and compassion... but they also have greed, arrogance, brutality, jealousy, and coldness. There are many among us who love to go to the cinema to watch crime movies or abnormal psychology films, watching the protagonist's cruel acts to fill the void that they cannot experience in real life. If we truly feared "evil" as we fear "epidemics," "ghosts," "darkness," "poverty," "hunger," or "atomic bombs," then we would only flee from it, and who would dare to appreciate it?

Therefore, I suddenly realized that world peace is not an unattainable castle in the air. If everyone in the world hopes for peace, peace can be achieved immediately. To this day, the world situation is still turbulent and unstable, and the gunpowder atmosphere on the world political stage seems to be getting stronger and stronger. Why is this? Perhaps it is because some people say they want peace with their mouths, but in their hearts, they find joy in war and killing. As far as these people are concerned, when they are tired of war and bitterly regret their past mistakes, eternal and true peace will still come to the world. It would naturally be better for them to wake up sooner, before things become irreparable.

### Observation

— He Yun

When Chinese people meet, they often like to ask, "What have you been doing for entertainment lately?" The answers are mostly: "Watching movies, playing cards..." or even "Very bored," "Nothing to do." In fact, there are materials worth studying everywhere in the world, but we just don't pay attention.

"Observation" is the most interesting work. The people in the world are of all kinds, and if we can do a reasonable analysis of them, the fun is endless. But "observation" is definitely not using despicable means to pry into other people's secrets. The condition of observation is calmness. Observing others and analyzing their character, its purpose is also to better understand oneself. The greatest pain of mankind is not understanding oneself. This is because people often judge themselves with their own consciousness and cannot look at themselves from the position of a third party. Observing others is easier to do objectively. Understanding others more easily also makes it easier to recognize oneself a little more. Therefore, observation is definitely not comparable to "prying into the secrets of others."

What we usually feel most inconvenient about when studying knowledge or theory is that they are too abstract or too rigid. But studying people's character is not only a practical but also an active work, which is the most interesting. From a person's face, speech, and behavior... we can determine his thoughts, wisdom, knowledge, likes, and dislikes... We can know whether he is active or quiet, rational or emotional, strong or cowardly. Although this cannot be trained in a day or two, over time, we will unlock many subtle mysteries of character, and our minds will also become as organized as a geometrician.

### Tricycle Philosophy

— Ping Zhai

Since moving to Hongkou, it has been eight or nine months. I always hire a tricycle to the office every day, and it has become a habit. Today, I suddenly remembered that the fare to the office when I first moved here seemed to be less than 5,000 yuan, but now it is already no less than 30,000 yuan. Exactly when did it rise from 5,000 to 10,000, and when did it rise from 10,000 to 20,000 to 30,000? I simply can't say. In the past, when I paid 5,000 yuan, I never felt it was cheap. Now, when I pay 30,000 yuan, I don't feel it's too expensive either. In all fairness, the "automatic adjustment" of the fare is natural. From the point of view that the adjustment is completely seamless, I feel that the adjustment is very reasonable.

Therefore, I thought of the bargaining when hiring a car, which is actually quite interesting. For example, when the driver asks for 40,000 yuan, he may have the thought in his mind that "30,000 yuan is also okay." So when I counteroffer and say "25,000," he will sometimes laugh and say, "Okay, 30,000." So the transaction is successful, and both he and I are satisfied. On the other hand, if I insist on only offering 20,000 yuan, and it is raining, and the ground is muddy and difficult to walk on, he will definitely not agree, and I will have to bury my head and rush on the road in the rain. Not to mention that my leather shoes are splashed with mud, my briefcase will also be wet as if it was fished out of the water. In a moment of anxiety, I still have to hire a car, and the result is often that the fare is still 30,000 yuan, and I have only walked a long distance in vain.

Therefore, "bargaining" is completely a matter of "estimation." His haggling is an estimation of his own labor, and in my case, I estimate whether this value is reasonable. I haggle because I want to "live"; I can't haggle too low, because I should also "let others live."

The competition in the biological world is so fierce that "living" and "letting others live" seem to be in conflict. It is quite difficult to find that delicate balance between these conflicts, and "estimation" becomes a very difficult art. If the Japanese had estimated more accurately, they might not have tasted the flavor of the atomic bomb; if Hitler had estimated more accurately, perhaps his position today would still be above Franco and Perón.

Therefore, if everyone is good at haggling for tricycle fares, it must be beneficial to the peace of the world. My son is only three years old now, and when he learns to read and write in the future, I will definitely teach him the way of hiring tricycles first. My "family instruction" is actually very simple: if you don't ride a tricycle, that's fine. If you want to ride, you can't haggle too low. Otherwise, even if you are stuck in the mud and sigh, others will inevitably criticize you with only the words "serves you right."

Empty Valley

困顿閒居嬾, 艱危老病深, 江清秋滿地, 烽火夜驚心; 大陸龍蛇起, 高嚴虎豹沈, 蘊藏君子德, 空谷閟幽音.

(Translation:

Idleness in adversity,
Old age and illness weigh me down,
Clear river, autumn fills the land,
Beacon fire frightens the heart at night;
Dragons and snakes rise on the mainland,
Tigers and leopards sink into haughty silence,
Hiding the virtue of a gentleman,
An empty valley keeps its secluded sound.)

Climbing the Tower

王粲當時賦, 登樓百感多, 倚天無寳劍, 斫地有悲歌. 量腹雄心陡, 科頭短鬢皤, 磨磚空作鏡, 春夢醒娑婆.

(Translation:

Like Wang Can of old,
Climbing the tower, so many feelings arise,
No precious sword to lean on the sky,
Only a sorrowful song to strike the earth.
Measuring the belly, heroic ambition rises,
Bareheaded, short temples gray,
Grinding bricks in vain for a mirror,
A spring dream awakens to the Saha world.)

, 心乒堅勒破無明, 依人終古非長策, 執我從來少至情, 幡動悠悠空四相, 輪迴歷歷證三生, 只因斷滅無常性, 淨掃塵埃澈底淸.

(Translation:

(Unclear meaning, seems to be Buddhist themed.
Breaking through ignorance with firm resolve,
Relying on others is not a long-term plan,
Clinging to self has always lacked true feeling,
The banner moves, empty are the four aspects,
Reincarnation clearly proves three lives,
Only because of the impermanent nature of cessation,
Sweep away the dust and cleanse thoroughly.)

寿潘稚亮六十

寫經便是長生果, 我却輸君翰墨新, 笻竹方袍東海角, 蓬萊三度看揚塵.

(Translation:

Writing scriptures is the fruit of longevity,
But I lose to you in new ink,
Bamboo staff and square robe at the corner of the East Sea,
Three times have I seen dust rise and fall on Penglai Island.)

米顚愛石眞成癖, 坡老談禪却是空, 悟得浮生原是夢, 生涯都在水雲中.

(Translation:

Mi Dian's love for stones truly became an obsession,
Su Lao's talk of Zen is empty,
Realizing that floating life is originally a dream,
My life is all in the water and clouds.)

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 13 Striving to Remedy (105)

It turned out that Qihuan had returned alone this time, because after arriving in Hong Kong with Daoyun, they stayed in a hotel. In the first few days, she took him to visit two photography factories, which Daoyun claimed he had shares in. After visiting these two factories, Daoyun went out every day and didn't return until late at night. When he returned, he was either drunk or covered in opium smoke. When asked where he had gone, he always gave vague excuses, claiming to be dealing with company business or socializing with friends. Later, seeing him like this every day, she occasionally asked to go out with him, but he always made excuses. After inquiring, she learned that he spent every day in gambling dens. Hong Kong's gambling dens were notorious for ruining people, so how could she let him do this? Whenever she tried to persuade him, he always said that he had to socialize outside. To do a big business, he had to rely on socializing. If he wasn't active in the social scene, he would lose all kinds of opportunities. He had also come to Hong Kong to do some speculative trading. As long as this trade was successful, all problems would be solved. The so-called speculative trading was just a hope to get lucky in the gambling dens. Seeing what he was doing, it was all empty talk. He didn't mention a word about the film business, training basic staff, or hiring stars, as if all the words he had said in Beijing and Shanghai had been completely forgotten once he arrived in Hong Kong. Seeing this situation, how could she not be anxious? She repeatedly mocked and questioned him, but he just said with a smile, "In Hong Kong, what the rich pay attention to is speculative trading. As long as luck arrives, everything can be solved." One night he came back and sighed in the room. Qihuan ignored him. Later, he muttered to himself, "I'm really unlucky today." She said, "You're originally unlucky! You don't do anything good all day, just mess around in gambling dens. How can you not be unlucky?" He said, "It's originally nothing. Losing a million Hong Kong dollars isn't anything, but this money was for a deposit. If I lost it, and the order is delayed, it will be much more expensive! I could borrow from friends, but I don't want to ask. Last time I saw you had a box of jewelry. Can you lend it to me to pawn it first? I'll return it to you tomorrow afternoon. Is that okay?" Qihuan said it was okay, but it was already past three o'clock today. Nothing can be rushed in one day. Wait until tomorrow! He said, "It's still possible now." Qihuan ignored him, and he didn't dare to ask again. That night, Qihuan thought all night that Daoyun's actions were simply trying to trick her out of her things! If she continued to associate with him, all the savings she had would be tricked out of her. Seeing this situation, she had to leave him immediately.

### Antiquarianism and Dogmatic Conservatism

— Yi Feng

In terms of time, the past and the present are relative terms. The past is ancient, and the present is now. This is common knowledge that everyone knows, so naturally there is no need to elaborate.

It is said that Qin Shi Huang burned books and buried scholars, and his motivation was related to the scholars' "fondness of the past and disdain for the present." This may not be a fabrication. Because after Qin Shi Huang completed his unification of the world, he began to abolish the feudal system and establish prefectures and counties, making unprecedented reforms in politics. As a result, intellectuals with minds full of old culture and restoration ideas naturally held dissatisfaction. Thus, the so-called "differing in their hearts when inside, and discussing it in the streets when outside" may not have been out of character. As a result, it exceeded the scope of what the autocratic monarch of the generation could tolerate, thinking that they were deliberately causing trouble, opening their mouths to Yao and Shun, and closing their mouths to Wen and Wu, "using the past to criticize the present, confusing the common people." As a result, he staged the tragedy of burning books and burying scholars, "unprecedented and unparalleled," even to the point of "those who accidentally spoke of poetry and books being abandoned in the marketplace!"

Mankind does indeed have this inferiority. When he is dissatisfied with reality, he often expresses his "ancient sentiments," naturally falling into the trap of "fondness of the past and disdain for the present." Some who are more stubborn become die-hard restorationists, gnawing on dead bones, bringing out useless things like "ancestral precepts" and "ancient systems" to overwhelm people. Wang Anshi, a great politician of the Song Dynasty, in order to implement his determination to implement the New Policies, once solemnly said to Emperor Shenzong during an audience: "Heavenly changes are not to be feared, ancestors are not to be followed, and people's words are not to be feared." What courageous and bold words these were! But the phrase "ancestors are not to be followed" became the focus of the conservatives' personal attacks on him, even bestowing upon him the nickname "Stubborn Chancellor." From this, one can also know how deeply rooted "the past" is in the hearts of conservatives.

After the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shih and others advocated the vernacular movement and also encountered the siege of many defenders of classical Chinese. Although vernacular Chinese now has its solid foundation, there are still many ancients who defend the past. I remember that a year or two ago, someone was still calling for the re-promotion of vernacular Chinese. We can easily know that a new reform will inevitably encounter challenges from all sides. The road ahead is truly long and difficult! Naturally, not all "ancient" things are completely bad, but all "ancient" things that do not meet the needs of the times and are out of touch with the times are undoubtedly to be discarded. What's more, clinging to the ancient without change is, after all, hindering the progress of the times and is a very dangerous thing!
