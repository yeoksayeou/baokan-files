### Dong Xianguang Issues Statement: Cancellation of Grain Rationing Measures in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin is to Seek Fairness and Reasonableness in the Treatment of Public Servants and Teachers

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Regarding the Executive Yuan's meeting to cancel the grain rationing measures for public servants and teachers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other four cities from February, and that central government public servants and teachers everywhere will be given three "shi" of rice at no cost, the Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, said: The government, in accordance with the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, issued the Measures for Rationing Daily Necessities for Public Servants and Teachers on February 19 last year, with the original intention of stabilizing the lives of public servants and teachers. At that time, it was thought that after supplying in-kind goods, salaries would no longer need to be adjusted, and the scope of rationing was not intended to be all-encompassing, and the types of rationed goods were also limited. After May last year, in view of the difficult lives of public servants and teachers, the original intention was changed to continue to adjust salaries. At that time, the rationing measures should have been cancelled, but the price difference between the rationing in Beijing and Shanghai was not too great, and the adjustment of new salaries was difficult to fully meet the ideal due to the government's financial difficulties, so the rationing measures were still retained. Until the second half of last year, prices soared. In addition to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, public servants and teachers in other places demanded the same treatment. If in-kind goods were distributed in all parts of the country at the same time, it would be difficult to do in practice. The treatment of public servants and teachers should not suffer from scarcity but from inequality. It should be planned as a whole to enable civil and military personnel serving the central government in various places to receive fair treatment. Therefore, at the State Council meeting on January 9 this year, when the national budget for the first half of the 37th year was approved, it was decided to adopt the method of adjusting treatment every three months according to the cost of living index. Furthermore, the 15th temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan approved the cancellation of the original grain rationing measures for public servants and teachers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other four cities from February. Central government public servants and teachers everywhere will be given three "shi" of medium-grade rice at no cost from February, and skilled workers and laborers are also stipulated to be given two "shi" per person per month at no cost; in this way, the treatment of civil and military personnel is exactly the same. As for the rationing of other daily necessities, it is not affected by this. In short, the government's intention in this measure is to seek fair and reasonable treatment for central government public servants and teachers in various places.

This is the most severe blow suffered by the communist bandits since the winter insurgency, following the Gongzhutun (north of Xinmin) battle. After the Xinlitun defense began, the defending troops fought bravely and repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the communist bandits who continuously reinforced.

The Chairman was in good health and high spirits, which the representatives were very pleased to see. The details of the petition have already been reported in today's newspapers, so I will not repeat them.

However, I sincerely hope that the central government can implement fair policies, and the people of North China will not make excessive demands and will strive to rectify themselves to cooperate with the central government's fair policies. The Shanghai press's support for the petition delegation is also assistance to tens of millions of compatriots in North China. I sincerely hope that the Shanghai press can report more on the situation in North China to promote the central government's attention.

Xu Huidong Hopes for Military-Political Coordination

Mr. Xu Huidong then gave a speech, stating that he had sincere discussions with various ministries and commissions in Nanking.

Although the result of this petition has been decided in principle, he still hopes that the technical implementation can be promoted more smoothly in the future. Mr. Xu finally talked about the political and military situation in North China, saying that Director Li of the Pingxingyuan and General Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of the North China Bandit Suppression, are cooperating very well. He hopes that the economic situation in North China can match the current excellent military situation; and even more, that the existing military situation can remain unchanged, which would be of great benefit.

Luo Dunwei Wishes a Triumphant Return

Finally, Mr. Luo Dunwei was invited to stand up and speak, saying that in the current situation of suppressing the rebellion, North China occupies a pivotal position, and the arrival of the North China Petition Delegation should be valued. However, the government sometimes has unavoidable difficulties. The petition delegation's achievements are not easy, and it is enough to prove that the central government deeply understands the difficult situation in North China. I strongly agree with Mr. Shi's proposal to implement the principle of fair allocation, and I extend my congratulations to the representatives for their triumphant return from the petition.

Qin Decun, Lin Wei, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Zhen, and senior officials of the garrison headquarters went to the Gugong Airport to welcome him. After disembarking, Mr. Sun told reporters that he would pay his respects to the Chairman within days and then assume office. Mr. Sun also said that he was willing to meet with reporters. When asked about the situation in North China, Mr. Sun said, "I'll talk about it later." Mr. Sun traveled with very few staff. Although he traveled a long distance, he was still in good shape. His dislike of talking too much also remained unchanged.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th] Sun Lianzhong flew to Nanking on the 27th at 2:00 PM aboard the Zhuiyun plane to take office. His wife, Luo Yufeng, and six children accompanied him.

To maintain the stability of the capital, it is most important to organize and train the people. The past baojia system was too lax and could not fight against the communist bandits. In the future, it should be more strict. In addition, if the military police and constitution can cooperate closely, they can exert great power, and not many troops are needed. He reviewed the military and political situation in Hebei over the past two years, saying: Although I have not achieved any brilliant results in the past two years, I have done my best personally. He spoke of the overall situation in the North, saying: The situation will not get any worse in the future.

Editorial

### Sending Recovered Soldiers Back to the Front Lines!

Two thousand wounded and honored soldiers, having been treated and recuperated, have fortunately recovered. Unwilling to let their thighs grow fat, they will set off again for the front lines within days. People from all walks of life in Shanghai will hold a grand consolation meeting today, the anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident, to bid farewell to our two thousand heroic soldiers heading north to kill the bandits. This is not only an honor that the two thousand soldiers deserve, but also a very meaningful event for the city in recent times. In addition to paying our highest respects to our loyal and brave soldiers, we would also like to take this opportunity to plead with our compatriots across the country to pay attention to the current situation.

The eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan was an unprecedented catastrophe in our nation's history; but after eight years of arduous trials and tribulations, we finally achieved final victory. The inspirational spirit of the Supreme Commander was undoubtedly a major factor in the victory, and the greatness of our loyal and brave soldiers' contribution to the country is truly unforgettable. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the soldiers who had worked so hard and made such great contributions not only failed to receive special respect from the nation and the people. The treatment of civil servants was already meager, but the treatment of soldiers was even worse than that of civil servants, and the lives of lower-ranking officers and soldiers were especially heartbreaking. The salary they received each month was barely enough to support one person, let alone their families. However, the soldiers across the country all understood the greater good and knew that this was the result of the communist bandits' harming the country and the people. Not only did they not complain, but they redoubled their efforts to suppress the bandits and quell the rebellion. They believe that the war to quell the rebellion is a continuation of the War of Resistance Against Japan. They believe that the communist bandits grew strong during our War of Resistance Against Japan, so if the victory of the War of Resistance is not followed by the quelling of the rebellion, the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance will be eroded by the communist bandits without a trace! They believe that the Japanese invaders were the enemy of all our compatriots in those years, but today's communist bandits worship foreign leaders as deities and regard the culture and education of the motherland as tattered shoes, and have already become foreign lackeys in their souls. This is why these loyal and brave soldiers are advancing one after another, vowing to destroy the communist bandits.

Today, the two thousand soldiers who are returning to the front lines, in our view, are representatives of the national army. They have all been through hundreds of battles and are sworn enemies of the communist bandits. Although they have suffered heavy injuries, after returning to the rear and recovering, they are willing to return to the front lines to take pride in killing the bandits. We, as ordinary people, can only feel ashamed and grateful to these soldiers who are loyal to the country; especially as the recovered soldiers are about to return to the front lines, we should feel that we have let them down too much.

The purpose of the communist bandits in creating chaos is not only to expand their territory by force, but also to destroy domestic transportation, destroy the people's productive enterprises, and promote the economic collapse of the entire country, thereby making it impossible for the people to live, so as to achieve their conspiracy to seize power. For two years, the people in the bandit areas have already been unable to live; we have seen countless displaced refugees in several important cities in the rear, which is clear evidence. The general public in the rear, affected by the war, soaring prices, and insecure lives, naturally also feel very distressed. However, if we take a step back and compare the lives of the people in the rear with the lives of the people in the war zone, there is a world of difference. In other words, although our lives are difficult, we can still survive on coarse tea and thin rice; although our property and businesses have also been indirectly affected by the war, there is still a considerable degree of safety and security. In particular, I would like to ask those wealthy merchants to ask themselves late at night: who's power are you relying on to exploit and plunder during the day and sing and dance all night long? We must know that the people in the rear can still live and work in peace, and we cannot but thank our loyal and brave soldiers! Today we can still hold grand gatherings here, and we cannot but attribute it to our heroic soldiers! Since the spring, the communist bandits have long put forward a slogan: "Ensure the Northeast, consolidate North China, and develop Central China": The communist bandits have recently also had the arrogant ambition to prepare to cross the Yangtze River this summer. What the communist bandits have been thinking about is the wealthy area south of the Yangtze River, the citizens of Shanghai! Don't sleep through this in confusion! If it were not for our loyal and brave soldiers, risking their lives and shedding their blood, to shatter the communist bandits' dreams on the front lines, what kind of world would Shanghai and Jiangnan be right now? It is not difficult to imagine!

Today, as we bid farewell to the recovered soldiers returning to the front lines, we should thank the hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the front lines who used their flesh and blood to break the communist bandits' military offensive, giving us a 120,000% certainty of victory in our military situation. Of course, we do not deny the severity of the situation: the war in the Northeast has not subsided due to the cold weather; the communist bandits are still stirring and trying to threaten the transportation on the Beining Railway; the war in North China has spread to the outskirts of Tianjin; and the communist bandits in Central China, namely the bandit troops of Liu Bocheng, Chen Qing, and Chen Yi, are flowing eastward and westward, trying to implement their so-called "development of Central China" conspiracy. However, the National Army is also reorganizing its deployment, blocking and actively suppressing them. After we have adopted the coordinated strategy of using local teams to respond to the situation with stillness and using the National Army corps to respond to the situation with movement, the entire military action to suppress the communist bandits will certainly move forward without retreat. The return of these two thousand heroic soldiers to the front lines will not only strengthen the military force to quell the rebellion, but will also have a great impact on boosting morale and inspiring the people.

In these past few days, the north wind has been howling and the ice and snow have been falling. As we bid farewell to these two thousand heroes heading north to kill the bandits, to fight for the defense of the country, to fight for the preservation of the nation, to fight to extinguish those who are willing to recognize foreign ancestors, we cannot help but shed our tears and shout: "May the two thousand heroes return in triumph soon!"

### Communist Bandits Murder Christians; Unprecedented Cruelty

Belgian Father Lists Facts in Peiping

[United Press, Peiping, 26th] A Belgian Catholic priest in Peiping told a United Press reporter on the 26th that the Chinese Communist Party's murder of Christians has exceeded the Boxer Rebellion's anti-Christian movement, and its intensity is unprecedented in Chinese history. Christians are not allowed to exist in communist areas. Chinese Christians, especially pastors, are either killed or imprisoned if they do not renounce their faith. Although Europeans are spared the death penalty, many are also abused and die of exhaustion. The communist bandits attribute this to illness. It is said that the communist bandits have two enemies: one is religion and the other is the United States. They do not distinguish between Christianity and Catholicism, referring to them as "American religion." In Rehe, the authorities have been severely oppressing Christians for more than a year. The abuses are countless. Nineteen Dutch and Belgian priests, two Chinese pastors, one father, two Dutch nuns, and an unknown number of Chinese nuns have been imprisoned by the communist bandits. Five or six people have been flogged. One person was thrown into a grassy pit almost naked in weather of minus 25 degrees Celsius. Two Belgian priests have already died, one in September last year and one on January 10 this year. The whereabouts of the other prisoners are unknown. Thirty of the forty churches in Rehe have fallen into the hands of the communist bandits. Four large churches have been burned down, and the other twenty-six have also been completely destroyed. In Ningxia, communist bandits attacked the Xiaojiabang (transliteration) Catholic Church on October 4, 1935, unsuccessfully. The other twenty churches were burned, looted, and occupied. On May 27, 1937, 1,500 communist bandits attacked the Xiaojiabang Church again. The parishioners stood firm and refused to hand over the pastor. In addition, there are countless instances of abuse and murder of Chinese and Western clergy and destruction of teaching.

Although the plant's efficiency has not been completely satisfactory, it has done its best. In order to meet the needs of industrial production and other needs, it is necessary to increase equipment. It has been decided that the National Resources Commission will allocate 9,000 KVA transformers and purchase four 2,500-watt oil-fired boilers from the United States, which can be shipped in the United States, and has ordered a 15,000-watt Tongping generator from Brown Boveri Company in Switzerland to come to Guangdong. One of the original 15,000-watt generators in the Xicun Power Station of the plant was destroyed during the war and is being transported to the United States for repairs. In addition, the Wengjiang Hydropower Station has been actively carrying out surveying and exploration projects, which will be carried out as soon as possible. After the implementation of this plan, the first step can increase the transformer capacity by 40,000 watts, and the second step can increase another 40,000 watts. Guangdong Province's coal resources are insufficient, and hydropower generation is very important. Coal Mine: The National Resources Commission originally jointly operated the Nanling Coal Mine Company with the provincial government in Pingshi Gouyadong. However, due to the fact that the railway branch line from the mining area to Pingshi has not been repaired, and external transportation is difficult, it is not easy to increase production. The coal quality of the mine has a very high heating power and very little ash content, which is very suitable for industrial use. It has now been agreed with the Ministry of Communications that the above-mentioned branch line will be repaired this year, and the amount of coal produced at that time can be increased from 50 tons per day to more than 500 tons. Next year, it is expected to increase to 1,000 tons per day, which will greatly benefit Guangzhou's coal supply. Sugar Industry: Guangdong Province's climate is suitable for planting sugar cane, but most of the old sugar factories were destroyed during the war. It has been agreed that the National Resources Commission and the Guangdong Provincial Government will jointly operate a sugar factory. The National Resources Commission will allocate a complete set of sugar refining machines with a daily sugar cane capacity of 1,000 tons, which will be transported to Guangdong for installation. This cooperation method has been agreed upon. Steel: The quality of the Hainan Iron Mine is particularly excellent. The Japanese-mined iron ore has been negotiated by the National Resources Commission for export sales. The foreign exchange obtained will be completely retained for the restoration of Hainan Iron Mine production and the establishment of a Hainan Steel Plant. The first step is to first re-produce sand from the mine, and the second step is to build an iron smelting furnace with a daily output of 500 tons and corresponding steel-making equipment in a suitable location in Hainan to refine various steel products. All of them will be jointly operated by the National Resources Commission and the provincial government. The foreign exchange for steel plant machinery has also been arranged.

### Marshall Appoints a Five-Member "Brain Trust" to Meticulously Plan a Major Diplomatic Strategy, Resist the Soviet Union, and Resolve Global Problems; European Aid Plan Likely to Pass Unanimously in Senate Foreign Relations Committee

[United Press International, Washington, 27th] It is learned that Secretary of State Marshall has appointed a top-secret, five-member "brain trust" to meticulously plan a long-term American foreign policy to counter Soviet strategies and solve global problems. As early as last year, on the second day of the serious "crisis" in Turkey and Greece, Marshall intended to organize a top-level foreign policy bureau. After the abject failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in April of last year, Marshall immediately ordered the brain trust to begin work. Since then, the group has met 120 times in extreme secrecy. The only publicly disclosed plan resulting from these meetings is the Marshall Plan for European aid. Only Marshall himself and Under Secretary of State Lovett raise questions to the brain trust, but once a question is raised, the group has full authority to deliberate. It is reported that the members of the brain trust include Davis, an expert on Far Eastern and Chinese affairs; Keenan, an expert on Soviet affairs; Savage, a veteran State Department official; Villard, an expert on Near Eastern and African affairs; and Caffery, an expert on European affairs. Based on their extensive experience in the diplomatic field, the brain trust drafts its recommendations after detailed consultations with other diplomats, officials from various departments, private industrialists, educators, scientists, and others.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Sources close to Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, revealed that, based on recent indications, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to unanimously pass the Marshall Plan for European aid. The Foreign Relations Committee will summon key State Department witnesses, possibly Secretary Marshall himself, this weekend or early next week to conclude weeks of ongoing review. It is anticipated that when the Foreign Relations Committee submits the revised European aid bill to Congress in mid-February, it will request confirmation that the aid period be four years and one quarter, with the initial fifteen-month aid amount being $6.8 billion. However, there will be slight discrepancies regarding the management aspects of the plan compared to Marshall's original proposal.

### Deeply Concerned About Jeopardizing the European Aid Plan, the United States Issues a Warning to France, Hoping for Close Cooperation with the International Monetary Fund

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] The U.S. State Department views France's devaluation of the franc like taking a bitter medicine. The department first stated that, in principle, it supports France's actions and hopes that the move will not damage the vitality of European recovery. The State Department issued two carefully worded statements, indicating the official American response. The first statement implored France not to abuse the devalued currency, lest it harm world trade, financial balance, or the Marshall Plan. The second statement stated that, while the United States does not completely agree on all the details, it welcomes the devaluation. The U.S. government firmly believes that France will cooperate with other members of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to implement its new exchange rate method.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] A U.S. Treasury Department spokesman formally confirmed that the U.S. government opposes the French government's measures to devalue the franc and establish a free foreign exchange market. He also warned that if the most feared effects of the franc devaluation materialize, they will have a serious impact on the smooth implementation of the Marshall Plan for European recovery. The spokesman also stated that the U.S. government's opinion on this matter is completely the same as that of the IMF. Therefore, the United States does not intend to take unilateral action toward the French government but will negotiate through the IMF.

The spokesman pointed out that France's measures have two dangers: First, French exporters who obtain goods at the official rate and then export them to the free market will inevitably lead to the implementation of various discriminatory rules, ultimately hindering international political relations. Second, France's sterling export trade will exert competitive pressure on neighboring countries, potentially triggering competitive currency devaluations in other European countries. If the franc devaluation can stabilize the trend of inflation domestically, it will benefit the European recovery plan. Otherwise, the resulting consequences will hinder the successful completion of the Marshall Plan.

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] An International Monetary Fund spokesman said that unless France adopts a new monetary system acceptable to the Fund before May, France will no longer be able to borrow the US dollars it needs from the Fund. According to Fund rules, each member state may borrow US dollars from the Fund up to one-quarter of its quota within one year. Countries with a stable economic foundation can expect to increase the borrowing amount stipulated for the first year in May. France's quota in the Fund is $525 million. In the first year, France can borrow $131 million, and it has already borrowed $125 million. From May onwards, France originally hoped to draw another $131 million.

### Implementation of Partition of the Holy Land Requires International Troops

Claim of the United Nations Committee

[Our Dispatch] New York, 27th, broadcast: Lake Success report, the United Nations Palestine Committee decided that when implementing the partition of the Holy Land, there is a clear need to use international troops.

### Britain Determined to Maintain Currency Value, but Still Willing to Maintain Full Cooperation with France, Strict Import and Export Controls Will Be Imposed When Necessary

[Associated Press, London, 27th] International financial market tensions have eased today after Britain guaranteed the stability of the pound. According to Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps, the government will take necessary steps without prior notice to prevent the pound from being affected by the devaluation of the franc.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Authoritative sources here believe that Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps's statement in the House of Commons on the devaluation of the franc fairly represents France's position. In particular, his statement that the technical disagreements between Britain and France will not affect the desire for full economic and political cooperation between the two countries is welcomed here.

[Associated Press, London, 26th] While Parliament has not been given any indication of how the pound will be maintained, the financial community believes that the government will implement stricter import and export restrictions. Many quarters suggest that British goods may be devalued in foreign markets to maintain the pound. Britain is currently drafting a detailed economic recovery plan based on increasing exports to 175 percent of the 1938 level. The London Stock Exchange is greatly concerned that France cannot prevent large-scale black market transactions in pounds, fearing that the illegal devaluation of the pound may be forced to a formal devaluation.

### Affected by the Franc Devaluation, London Securities Plunge; Active Speculation and Large-Scale Gold Purchases

[United Press International, Paris, 26th] The devaluation of the franc triggered reactions around the world on the 26th. Gold prices in the world's three major financial centers – New York, London, Paris, and Johannesburg in South Africa – rose sharply. British government securities plummeted on the London market, while the British government hastily prepared to stabilize the gold pound. New York securities were generally stable, and franc trading in New York was suspended, awaiting clarification.

[United Press International, London, 26th] Disregarding the government's promise that the devaluation of the franc would not cause the value of the pound to fall, British speculators sold off British pound bonds on the 26th, causing the total value of British government bonds on the London Stock Exchange to fall by a massive £400 million in a single day. Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps told the House of Commons on the 26th that the pound would still maintain the official rate of $4.03 to the pound, but on the market, British government bonds fell by £4 to £6 each, which was the biggest drop this month. The "Evening Standard" estimated the total loss in the value of British bonds to be £403 million. The new British Transport stock alone fell by £15.5 million, or $62.46 million. Most speculators bought gold and commercial and other stocks that might profit from the devaluation of the gold pound in large quantities. Gold stocks rose from eight dimes to one dollar, and it is estimated that speculators engaged in South African mining stocks can make a profit of £20 million.

### Kim Koo Opposes Separate Elections in South Korea

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 27th] Kim Koo, Vice Chairman of the Korean Provisional Legislative Assembly, told the Second Subcommittee of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea this morning that, with the people in the Soviet-occupied area under the control of powerful right-wing forces, it is impossible to hold free and unconstrained elections in South Korea. He believes that South Korea's future is bleak, saying that the right wing has long sought to hold separate elections in South Korea and that they are quite capable of controlling the people of South Korea. Kim, who is generally regarded as a moderate right-wing figure, expressed a different opinion from that of far-right leader Syngman Rhee, who testified before the Second Subcommittee yesterday. Rhee urged separate elections and the separate establishment of a government in South Korea. Meanwhile, the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea will hold a plenary session tomorrow morning to discuss steps to address the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea. Although the representatives of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea have differing opinions, the final decision will be made by the United Nations Resident Committee. Tomorrow's plenary session of the Commission may decide to submit the issue to the Resident Committee for resolution.

### Foreigner Who Served in Soviet Army Confirms Ukrainian Rebellion, Soviet Troops Unable to Suppress It

[Reuters, Nanjing, 27th] Reports that a major rebellion, the first of its kind since the founding of the Soviet Union, has broken out in southern Ukraine, involving 1.5 million participants, have been confirmed. Although previous reports in American newspapers about the Ukrainian rebellion had been denied, a certain important political figure here reaffirmed the matter to a Reuters correspondent, saying that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's trip to Ukraine is sufficient to confirm the information obtained by China.

He further stated that the Ukrainian people largely support the rebel guerrillas, and the Soviet troops are unable to suppress them. Severe rebellions will occur throughout the Soviet Union, which is likely the beginning of the final collapse of the entire Soviet structure. Such a Soviet system relies on the use of force to forcibly implement its political system and contains the seeds of inevitable collapse. This person also believes that the widespread unrest within the Soviet Union is the main reason for Moscow's arrogant attitude toward democratic countries, because Stalin and others believe that it is necessary to give the Soviet people the impression that Moscow is invincible. Otherwise, the people will rise up and overthrow the inhumane Soviet dictatorship. He went on to describe the inside story of the Ukrainian rebellion, saying: "For many months, the Ukrainian rebellion has been gradually expanding under the heavy Iron Curtain. Although Moscow has used high-pressure tactics and implemented a policy of group exile to Siberia, it still cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of guerrillas from hiding in the mountains, constantly striking Soviet troops. This rebellion is caused by centuries of traditional national consciousness and popular resentment towards the Moscow authorities. The latest person to confirm this news is William George, a university professor currently residing in China who served in the Soviet army for six years."

[Associated Press, Moscow, 26th] Pravda reports: Ukrainian Communist Party Secretary-General and Politburo member Khrushchev declared in the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet that small groups of Ukrainian nationalist troops have been destroyed, and the people should eliminate their remnants. The pawns of capitalism are infiltrating everywhere, attempting to alienate the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian people, thereby undermining the foundation of our strength. According to reports, messages about the activities of the Ukrainian Nationalist Party have frequently been reported in Western Europe since the war. Reports from Poland stated that Ukrainian terrorists were looting villages, and the German and American occupying forces had disarmed Ukrainians from the East who claimed to be from the East.

### European Manpower Conference Opens in Rome

United States Sends Observer to Attend

[Reuters, Rome, 26th] The European Sixteen-Nation Manpower Conference opened here today.

In addition, the United States, Turkey, Austria, the Netherlands, as well as the International Labor Organization, the IRO, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the International Bank, have all sent observers to attend.

### Communist Party Deliberately Creating Disturbances, Italian Prime Minister Sternly Condemns, Guarantees General Election in April Will Be Held as Scheduled

[Associated Press, Rome, 26th] When meeting with journalists today, Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi condemned the Communist Party for following the directives of the Soviet-controlled Cominform, inciting turmoil and confusion in France, attempting to undermine the Marshall Plan and seize power in both countries. De Gasperi said, "All disturbances, no matter how economic reasons are used as an excuse, are based on instructions issued by the Cominform to the French Communist Party."

De Gasperi's comments are the most frank remarks made by a senior Italian government official to date criticizing the Communist Party and its foreign directives. Riots broke out in Brescia and Messina on the 25th, injuring 37 people. Communist newspapers on the 26th accused the government of adopting harsh policies to deal with left-wing demonstrations, deliberately creating unrest, and intending to create an "excuse" to delay the national elections in mid-April. De Gasperi called such accusations "absurd" and guaranteed that the elections will be held as scheduled.

### On Handling the Issue of German Assets in Austria, the Soviet Union Proposes New Suggestions, the Foreign Ministers' Deputies Conference Will Reopen Next Week

[Reuters, London, 27th] After the Secretariat of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference received the latest Soviet suggestions on the issue of German assets in Austria, the Foreign Ministers' Deputies Conference is expected to reopen in London early next week. Although officials have not yet revealed the content of the new suggestions, it can be said that the Soviet Union has accepted France's proposal to transfer German assets to the Soviet Union in cash rather than in the physical form of German factory equipment. Regarding oil exploration and oil surveying rights in Austria, the Soviet Union's new suggestions are not much different from the Soviet Union's proposals at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in December last year, namely that the Soviet Union demanded to obtain two-thirds of the rights and interests, while France's plan only suggested giving 50% to the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet Union's new suggestions also involve the future status of the Danube Shipping Company's assets and ships. According to information from Vienna, the Soviet Union's latest suggestions have reduced the amount of claims by approximately $400 million compared to its original demands.

### French Parliament Discusses New Economic Measures, Free Trading of Gold Bill Rejected by Financial Committee

The vote was 17 to 15, with 5 abstentions. In addition, Foreign Minister Bidault and Finance Minister Mayer supported the government's franc devaluation and free foreign exchange trading measures at a joint meeting of various committees of the National Assembly.

### United States and Soviet Union Resume Negotiations on Resolving Lend-Lease Debt

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The State Department announced today that negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on resolving Lend-Lease debt have resumed based on the counter-proposal submitted by the Soviet Union last month. The amount proposed in the counter-proposal is lower than the amount requested by the United States for the Soviet Union to repay for Lend-Lease materials used during peacetime.

### A New Comet Hurtling Towards Earth

### Bizarre Robbery at a Bank in Tokyo, Robbers Trick Bank Employees into Taking Poison, Twelve People Die on the Spot, the Culprit Escapes

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] A bizarre robbery occurred at the Shīnaimachi branch of the Teikoku Bank yesterday. A robber disguised as a doctor from the health section of the police station tricked the bank staff into taking poison, resulting in the death of twelve people and severe poisoning of four others. The poison was colorless and odorless. After the bank staff took it, they started groaning in the office and died within a few minutes. When the police arrived, they found ten corpses scattered on the floor. Two other people died after being sent to the hospital.

It has not yet been determined whether the robber disguised as a doctor stole cash when he escaped. When the police arrived at the bank, 300,000 yen in banknotes were still piled on the table, and the safe was open. The incident occurred yesterday evening, but the police station did not announce it until today. It is said that just after closing time yesterday, a man came to the Shīnaimachi branch of the Teikoku Bank. He was about 45 years old, wore the armband of the Higashi-shima Police Station, showed bank's vice-manager Yoshida a card proving that he was a doctor and said: "I was dispatched by the Health Department to disinfect the bank, because dysentery is prevalent in the vicinity. Before implementing the disinfection, you and all the staff should quickly take this anti-dysentery medicine." The doctor then handed Yoshida a small bottle containing a clear liquid and warned that it must be taken before closing the safe (i.e. before the safe is locked).

### Hull's Memoirs Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department Living Under Tension for Twelve Full Years

As a long-standing custom, the Secretary of State would attend lunch or dinner almost every day, especially dinner. Regardless of the benefits of this custom, it undoubtedly consumed a great deal of time and even more energy. Regarding social matters, I made a decisive decision. I told the personnel of the diplomatic corps:

"I cannot go out to lunch and dinner with you almost every day. Doing so would make it impossible for me to meet and discuss matters with you, or if possible, the time would be extremely limited. You would have to see my Assistant Secretaries of State. Alternatively, I can refuse to go out to lunch and dinner with you, which would allow me to have more time to meet and discuss matters with you. I prefer the latter."

This approach was generally approved, and I believe the outcome was quite beneficial to all those involved. My evenings could be a little more free, allowing me to study the documents I brought home. The daytime could also be more free, allowing me to discuss issues with ambassadors, ministers, and personnel from the State Department. In the twelve years that followed, I adhered to this approach, with only a few exceptions when it was absolutely necessary for official or diplomatic reasons.

Regarding the inevitable part of social life, Mrs. Hull took on the responsibility, which benefited me greatly. She personally hosted banquets for foreign politicians visiting the United States, as well as managing the annual Cabinet dinners for the President. When I traveled abroad to attend conferences, since I could not personally visit the representatives of each country, she made social calls on the representatives' wives.

Some public officials often adopt a mutually understood approach of not revealing their political and official secrets to their wives, letting them be content with their own social lives or focusing on the responsibility of bearing and raising children. However, regarding any issue or person of importance to me, I always informed Mrs. Hull. She cautiously guarded every secret. Whether abroad or at home, in her conversations with diplomats and politicians, I never discovered a single error on her part.

Although I avoided social activities as much as possible, I did allow myself one form of entertainment, which proved to be of great benefit to my physical and mental well-being.

Three times a week, choosing days with good weather, to clear my mind, relax my body, and prepare for the work ahead, I would invite three companions to join me in playing stickball on the lawn of "Hotley" – the residence of Stimson, which Assistant Secretary of State Ball had rented for most of his time at the State Department. Stickball became my only exercise, and in the eyes of friends who did not play much stickball, I seemed to have become an expert.

To some, stickball may seem too gentle, but in reality, it is a highly scientific game. Players must be fully focused, or they will have no chance of winning. Four or five times a season, I could run across the entire field without stopping. I would let two or three other players start first; then, I would attack from the first gate, engaging with them and making them run after me, before defeating them in one fell swoop.

Once, McBride, who was formerly my assistant and later became the director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, brought a "skilled player" and introduced him to me as an old friend. It was later discovered that he was a stickball player from a certain department in the United States. However, perhaps because the player was unfamiliar with the local field, I won.

I was rarely able to play a game of stickball without interruption. Sometimes Stimson would come out and talk to me. Other times, I would receive urgent phone calls from the State Department or even from the President. Often, officials from the State Department would bring documents and ask me to review them and sign them before they left the State Department in the evening.

Stickball was extremely satisfying to me because it temporarily allowed me to forget about work and allowed me to go out and be in contact with open space and sunlight. However, in the last few years of my tenure at the State Department, due to the increasing burden of work, my doctor asked me to give up this game. Perhaps this game was more strenuous than most people imagined.

During my twelve years at the State Department, virtually every day could be described as extremely tense. A large number of urgent issues crowded in, requiring my colleagues and myself to work hard to deal with them. My entire term could almost be called an emergency period. Every aspect of human behavior in every part of the world passed before us, and we strove to handle each important issue appropriately.

Every morning, I always tried to arrive at my office between 9:00 and 9:10, often walking from my hotel to the State Department. I first met with my chief secretary. In the early years, it was Harry McBride, whose experience, judgment, ability, and skill in dealing with various people inside and outside the State Department were of great assistance to me. Later, Cecil W. Gray succeeded him. Mr. Gray's meticulousness, efficiency, loyalty, and various good qualities of service were admirable.

McBride or Gray would bring me a large number of telegrams and other letters from all over the world, and provide analysis of the estimates of our ambassadors and consuls abroad regarding various developments. Then, he would confidentially narrate to me any important events that had occurred within the State Department the previous day, and offer appropriate suggestions. Next, he would place a schedule of appointments for the day in front of me.

When I read the pile of documents, telegrams, and official letters placed before me, I would make decisions whenever possible, without holding meetings or conducting investigations, and at the same time, issue instructions to the relevant officials of the State Department for execution. I had to decide what was of utmost importance and should be notified to the President or decided by him.

Then, I would ask Under Secretary of State William Phillips to come in, followed by Sumner Welles, and finally Edward R. Stettinius Jr., and tell them all the information that would be useful for them in performing their duties. Next to come in were the Assistant Secretaries of State and other key officials of the State Department to discuss specific issues within their scope of work.

Throughout the day, requests to hold emergency meetings in my office were almost constant. As the world's unrest increased year after year, and our difficulties expanded accordingly, the number of meetings I held with key figures within the State Department also increased. Whenever a serious problem arose, I would summon every relevant person in the State Department, from top to bottom, without leaving anyone out. Anyone who could contribute to any aspect of the issue was summoned and given an opportunity to express their views. After the fullest consultation and discussion, I often liked to sit down and make my own final decision.

Occasionally, a person of swift action would accuse me of being too thoughtful, meaning too slow. My clear response to this criticism was that the errors that occurred in the conduct of public affairs during the Roosevelt era were caused by haste and lack of deliberation, while the policy I followed—that is, thorough consideration while also acting in a timely manner—resulted in many insiders saying that no major mistakes were ever made. To my knowledge, the President believed that I had never put him in a major predicament, whether he was in the country or away from the capital.

The stationery I liked to use most when drafting or reading documents was a red pencil. I often kept four or five in my shirt pocket, much to the annoyance of Mrs. Hull, who insisted that red pencil stains were difficult to wash out.

One day, an official from the State Department came to me and expressed his refusal to attend a meeting held by another official who was lower in rank than him. I said to him, "If the black porter outside the hall could offer some useful advice on any issue of interest to me, I would be happy to walk over to the table he has placed in the corridor and talk to him."

When I told any of my assistants something confidential, I sometimes said to him, "I am telling you this in confidence—which does not mean you can tell the first person you meet."

When receiving foreign ambassadors or ministers, I had long adopted an informal and friendly approach. If my main office was too crowded due to an important meeting, I would receive the diplomats in a small room between my office and my secretary's office. Later, my negotiations with the British Ambassador Lothian on exchanging American destroyers for British bases took place in this small room with almost primitive furnishings. From then on, if a diplomat showed any displeasure at being received in this simple room, I would mention to him the pleasant situation when the British Ambassador and other top diplomats sat together with me in this room and held the most important battles.

When receiving foreign diplomats, I always tried to treat them with the same sincerity and unpretentious attitude as I did any other visitor. I treated them as I treated the Americans I had met in my long political life. Generally speaking, I believed it was unfair to praise an ambassador for the merits of a government or blame him for its faults. There were a few exceptions to my courtesy. When another government took a reckless and rude action, I was not so polite. In such cases, as soon as the diplomat appeared at the door of my office, I would think of many ways to receive him with extreme coldness and express my personal and my government's feelings of disgust, almost to the extreme. This situation mostly occurred when receiving the Japanese ambassador in later years.

In dealing with foreign ambassadors, in addition to many principles, I established two more principles. One was not to make threats unless we had the strength and the will to back them up; a threat without the backing of strength is bluffing, and bluffing can lead to embarrassing results.

The other was not to make promises unless we were confident of fulfilling them. I often told a story to my colleagues. The story was: In a town along a lake in Tennessee, a man ran a small shop. One day, he contacted a food company and offered to sell a carload of frog legs. After negotiations, the company's representative came and they signed a contract. A few months later, the representative came again because the frog legs had not been delivered. He found only two frog legs in the shop, so he asked the shopkeeper why he had not kept his promise. The man said, "Oh, the sound of frogs around the lake is so loud, I thought there must be at least a carload."

As soon as an ambassador or minister left my office, one of my stenographers would automatically walk in from another door. I would immediately read the summary of the discussion to her, recording as accurately as possible what he had said to me and what I had said to him, and attaching any written materials that one of us had given to the other. I would then telegraph the contents of this memorandum to our ambassador or minister stationed in the capital of the government of the diplomat who had just visited me. This was to ensure that he was fully aware of all developments in this regard. Other telegrams were sent to our representatives in the capitals of other countries, if the situation at the time was also relevant to those countries.

### Japanese War Criminal Escapes Prison; No Trace After More Than a Month; Detention Center Director Discusses the Incident; Security Forces Too Weak

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhongye Jiuyong, the former head of the Special High Section of the Chongming Gendarmerie of the Japanese war criminals, escaped from prison before the military tribunal's scheduled sentencing. Yesterday, the reporter made a special visit to Zou Renzhi, director of the Jiangwan war criminal detention center, to inquire about the details. According to Zou, the prisoner escaped late at night on December 24 of last year. The detention center's regulations require lights to be turned off at 9 p.m. every evening. On that day, which happened to be a Sunday, the prisoner made an excuse to urinate after the lights were turned off and sneaked to the edge of the northern electric fence. He escaped by pressing a wooden board over the fence. Afterwards, the commander of the guard camp stationed at the detention center realized that the prisoner had not returned for a long time. When he went to the toilet to check, he was nowhere to be found. He urgently sent people out to search, but only found a woolen overcoat discarded by the electric fence. The prisoner had already escaped without a trace. After receiving the report, Zou sent staff to search in the areas where Japanese expatriates lived and notified military and police agencies and nearby county governments to assist in the investigation, but there has been no lead for more than a month.

Zou continued, stating that the war criminal detention center occupies dozens of acres, but the security forces are extremely weak. Within the perimeter of the surrounding electric fence, the detention center sends more than a dozen people to guard and manage it. Outside the electric fence, the Youth Army assists in guarding, but since it is not a full-time job, negligence is inevitable. Zou had previously requested the Ministry of National Defense to allow the prison authorities to recruit their own guards, but this was not granted. The plan to build walls around the prison and establish a prison was submitted for review before April, and was only recently approved. Due to rising prices, the original budget was insufficient, so the scope of the walls had to be reduced to surround five prison houses, and construction began ten days ago. Starting this year, military tribunals in various places will be closed and war criminals will be concentrated in Shanghai for imprisonment. More than 300 people have already been imprisoned. Before the prison is completed, Zou has ordered the guards to strengthen their vigilance on shifts. Zou will also go to Beijing again to request the Ministry of National Defense to increase security forces.

It is reported that Zhongye Jiuyong murdered more than a dozen of our district chiefs and guerrillas during his tenure in the Chongming County Gendarmerie, and drowned their bodies in the sea after tying them with stones. Last year, the military tribunal summoned the prisoner for questioning several times and sent personnel to Chongming to conduct on-site investigations. The evidence was conclusive, and sentencing was imminent. It is clear that the prisoner escaped out of fear of punishment.

### C.T.C. Foreign Coal Purchase: 100,000 Tons to be Delivered by Deadline

### Electric Heaters Prohibited; Violators Will Have Their Electricity Cut Off

[Reported by this newspaper] The Public Utilities Bureau announced yesterday: The use of electric heaters is strictly prohibited from now on. Violators will have their electricity cut off. Due to the recent cold weather, citizens have been using electric heaters to keep warm, causing power companies to be overwhelmed. They have had to cut off electricity to factories, severely affecting production. The Public Utilities Bureau believes that with traffic to the north obstructed and coal supplies extremely scarce, citizens must not waste electricity any further. It has instructed all power companies to pay close attention and to cut off the electricity of those found using electric heaters.

### This Year's Farmers' Day: Commemoration Measures Stipulated

[Reported by this newspaper] The measures for commemorating this year's Farmers' Day (the day of the Beginning of Spring) have been stipulated by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

### Free Transportation for Demobilized Soldiers Returning Home: Deadline Passed

In order to give preferential treatment to demobilized soldiers returning home, the Ministry of National Defense had previously issued an order to all land, sea, and air transportation agencies in the country, allowing demobilized soldiers to ride trains and ships at half price and buses for free upon presenting their discharge certificates. The Ministry of Communications has telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense, stating that the cost of vehicle and ship transportation is very high and they cannot afford to bear the losses from the preferential treatment for the long term. The previously stipulated measures allowing demobilized soldiers to ride vehicles and ships for free have been extended until the middle of this month. The Ministry of National Defense is now ordering all military, police, security, and transportation agencies across the country to comply.

### Gasoline Prices Rise Three Times in One Month; Airlines Unable to Bear the Burden

[Reported by this newspaper] Gasoline prices were adjusted again yesterday due to the appreciation of foreign exchange. The price at gas stations increased from 48,000 yuan to 56,000 yuan per gallon. Aviation gasoline prices also increased at the same time. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) have received notices from gasoline companies that gasoline prices at each station have increased by an average of more than 17%.

Yesterday, spokespersons for both companies said: Gasoline prices had already increased twice on the 1st and 11th of this month, totaling 32%. Now there is another increase. With three increases in one month, it is really making the airlines unable to bear the burden. It is generally speculated that airfares may be adjusted again in the short term.

### Jewelry Stores Re-Registering: Awaiting Issuance of Business Licenses

### The Case of the Real and Fake Wife: The Defendant Leaves the Country, the Court is Surprised

[Report from our Newspaper] In the case of the real and fake wife, after the defendant Gao Qinqiu was publicly prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for the crime of corruption, the case has been transferred to the Criminal Division of the District Court for handling. Gao took the Gordon ship on the 19th of this month to go to the United States to visit her lover, Xie Jiashu, who is in charge of the consulate in San Francisco. Before leaving, she submitted a statement to the District Court, stating that she was instructed by Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to go abroad and would not be able to attend the court hearing. The court was surprised that Gao's passport had previously been detained by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it was returned after the prosecution and she was allowed to leave the country.

### Observatory Wharf: Motorized Junk Carelessly Burns

[Report from our Newspaper] The "Fengying" motorized junk, fully loaded with bean cakes, soybeans, and other groceries, was preparing to set sail for Fujian from the Observatory Wharf at about 1:00 PM yesterday. Because the water pipe was frozen and the steam pipe could not be started, charcoal fire was used to try to thaw the frozen water pipe. However, there was diesel fuel stored all around, and a spark fell into the oil, immediately igniting a fire. The crew members urgently used fire extinguishing liquid to try to put out the fire, but because the soybeans, bean cakes, and other items on board were all flammable, the fire quickly became fierce and impossible to extinguish. Later, members of the Jianghai Customs Port Fire Brigade noticed the fire and immediately dispatched the "Huning" fire boat to put out the fire, which was extinguished after half an hour. The hull of the motorized junk was made of wood, and a large part of the rear cabin above the waterline was burned. Fearing that it would sink, it was towed by a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company tugboat to the shallow滩 in Lujiazui, Pudong, to be grounded. The fire brigade pumped out the water used to extinguish the fire from the cabin, and then removed the soaked soybeans and bean cakes to prevent them from expanding and damaging the hull. The firefighters did not finish their work and return to the brigade until 11:00 PM last night. None of the employees on the motorized junk were injured.

### American Trading Firm Suffers Electrical Fire, Burning Many Cotton Samples

[Report from our Newspaper] At approximately 7:30 PM last night, an electrical fault occurred at the American trading firm "Old Brabson & Co.," located in Room 4 on the second floor of the Chartered Bank building on the Bund. Sparks flew everywhere, and a large quantity of cotton samples quickly caught fire. The fire department dispatched vehicles to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was put out after about an hour. The losses were said to be significant.

### Request for Repayment of Outstanding Funds: Judge Accused of Malfeasance

[Report from our Newspaper] Lawyer Cheng Mengming previously filed a lawsuit against Li Jinlu, the director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, requesting the return of "outstanding funds" after the increase in postal and telegraph rates. The Civil Division judge of the District Court, Ling Yuanqing, ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. Cheng believes that the reasoning for the judgment was insufficient because the original judgment was based on a resolution of the State Council. However, he believes that a resolution of the State Council is merely a legislative principle and not a law. Without the approval of the Legislative Yuan, it cannot constitute legal force. The basis of the original judgment was clearly inappropriate. According to Article 124 of the Criminal Law, a public official with judicial power who makes a judgment that bends the law is subject to punishment. Cheng filed a complaint with the court against Ling for malfeasance yesterday, based on this article. He also sent a letter to Wang Shuceng, a member of the Control Yuan, requesting that he file an impeachment according to the law.

### Fifth General Meeting of the Council: To be Held on February 16th

Nine Bureau Directors will be Invited to Report on Their Duties Separately; Proposals Will Be Accepted Until the Day the Reports are Completed

[Report from our Newspaper] The Fifth General Meeting of the First Session of the Municipal Council has been decided to be held on February 16th. The Secretariat of the Council is preparing relevant materials and will formulate the agenda. However, because this meeting falls at the beginning of the 37th year, the Council has decided to make slight changes to the agenda compared to the previous meeting. The nine bureau directors of the Municipal Government will be invited to report on the situation of their respective bureaus in detail (in the past, the mayor gave a unified report), and three bureaus will report each day. Therefore, the meeting period will be extended by several days, and it is expected to end on the 10th. However, the time will still be half a day in the afternoon, and the meeting will open in the afternoon on the first day. In addition, because proposals in the past were submitted successively during the meeting, making it difficult to review and time-consuming to discuss, it has now been decided to set the deadline for collecting proposals as the day the bureaus complete their reports. The review meetings will be held on the next two days.

Expanding Broadcasting Methods

According to suggestions from Council members to the Secretariat of the Council, in order to make the citizens generally understand the meeting situation of the Council, the broadcasting should be expanded, and it was proposed that the meeting should be jointly broadcast by all radio stations in the city. The Secretariat of the Council is quite in favor of expanding the broadcasting method, but it seems unnecessary and impossible to have a joint broadcast by all radio stations in the city. The current plan is to report the agenda for the next day in advance during the broadcast of each day's meeting to prepare the audience to listen. In addition, for important proposals, the reporters will first explain them, so that the citizens can understand their nature.

### Red Light Malfunctioned, Drug Use Exposed: Policemen Posed as Customers to Enter the Room; Arrested the Owner of "Wild Water Chestnut"

[Report from our Newspaper] Tang Mujun, 42 years old, from Ningbo, the owner of the "Wild Water Chestnut" candy store opposite the Great World on Xizang South Road, is addicted to opium. He also has a branch store at No. 463 Minguo Road. When Tang has free time, he goes to the room upstairs in the branch store to indulge. To prevent accidents, he installed two red and green electric lights next to the counter. In case of an emergency, he would order the accountant, Ni Bingwen, to press the red light to facilitate escape. However, the secret was not well kept, and it was detected by the North Railway Station Police Branch. At 4:30 PM yesterday, Section Chief Tian Gu of the North Railway Station Police Branch ordered officer Bei Bin to lead policemen in disguise to No. 4612 Minguo Road. Officers were stationed at the front and rear doors, and one policeman pretended to be a customer and entered the store. First, Ni Bingwen was captured, and then, upon a signal, the other policemen rushed in and captured the main culprit, Tang Mujun, and his friends Zhang Songming, Xu Bi, Zhao Jingxian, and Zhou Hanzhang, and also found two taels of opium.

It was detected by the North Railway Station Branch yesterday afternoon, and policemen were dispatched to raid it.

Heroic Police Dogs Demonstrate Actions: Minli and Jialin Hold Two Guns in Their Mouths

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Police Bureau, in order to quickly solve cases, has trained a batch of police dogs to participate in surprise searches. A few days ago, when the Yulin Road Police Branch was searching in its jurisdiction, two police dogs, "Jialin" and "Minli," made outstanding contributions, solving a drug trafficking case and an illegal possession of military weapons case. Yesterday afternoon, reporters visited the police training center and were instructed by Yao Fanwei, the leader of the police dog team, to have "Jialin" and "Minli" demonstrate their agile actions. Within a few minutes, they found opium guns, retrieved handguns, and completed the case. According to Yao, these police dogs are German Shepherds. The training program must go through: 1. Basic training: come, go, walk, stand, sit, lie down, get up, and crouch. 2. Intermediate training: "barking," "up and down," "jumping," "refusing food," "sound," "holding and spitting," "crawling," "swimming," "finding objects," and "finding the owner." 3. Applied training: "attack," "bite," "chase," "surveillance," "escort," "guard," "transmit," "rescue," "patrol," "search," "identification," and "tracking." The police dogs eat three meals a day, morning, noon, and night. Each dog is provided with half a catty of beef, one catty of rice, four taels of vegetables, and five qian of salt per day. Biscuits are added during training. After such training, they can use their agile actions to achieve their case-solving tasks. (The attached picture shows "Minli," who solved the case, holding a handgun in her mouth, and "Jialin" holding an opium gun in her mouth, both completing the task. (China News Agency Photo))

### Jianghai Customs Corruption Case Concluded: Officials and Merchants to be Sentenced Separately on a Scheduled Date: Yin Lansun and Others Confess to Corruption and Accepting Bribes

[Report from our Newspaper from Nanjing on the 27th] The Capital District Court interrogated for twelve hours from morning to night on the 27th, concluding the Jianghai Customs corruption case. The bribery part is scheduled to be sentenced at 3:00 PM on the 31st of this month, and the merchant bribery part is scheduled to be sentenced at 3:00 PM on February 2nd. The court opened at 儿时 (a time between 7-9 AM) this morning. Presiding Judge Ouyang Shu, together with judges Ren Yiru and Zhao Ruji, formed a collegial panel. First, Lu Genquan, the owner of the Lu Genji Construction Company, the original informant of the case, was summoned. Lu said: The 400 tons of galvanized iron sheet he purchased were ordered from the Yifeng Firm, operated by Mao Fengxiang, through the introduction of Jiang Baoliang before the establishment of the Transportation Control Committee. However, after the goods arrived in port, after the establishment of the Transportation Control Committee, it had exceeded the deadline, and the Transportation Control Committee had to extend the deadline before it could be imported. He entrusted Mao to find a way to go through customs procedures and import the goods. According to Mao and Jiang, the customs demanded 16% of the value of the goods as a reward. It was later reduced to 15%, but he could not afford it and often reported it to the Confidential Bureau for investigation. After Lu's testimony, the contract was presented to the court for verification. Then the relevant parties, Mao and Jiang, were brought in. According to their testimony, they entrusted Fang Maolin of the Maotai Foreign Firm to handle the customs clearance and import procedures for Lu. Once the bill of lading for the goods was in his hands, it was transferred to the customs and could not be retrieved. They could only be blackmailed. First they wanted 7 or 8%, then it rose to 16%. After negotiation, Fang Maolin was paid $12,360 in American dollars, according to the 15% rate. Then they demanded another 300 million, and after several negotiations, they paid 270 million, of which 10.44 million was paid by Mao. The hearing was adjourned at twelve o'clock. In the afternoon, the main culprits were brought in for questioning. First, Yin Lansun was interrogated. According to his testimony, the several acts of corruption were all set up by Yue Xinmin and Zhang Yuan. He only found out later, but it was too late. He admitted to receiving bribes in three cases: $1,500 in American dollars for the Lu Genji iron sheet case, 20.4 million in French currency for the Yisheng Company wool case, and $3,000 in American dollars for the Minfu Company dye and caustic soda case. In addition to complaining about Zhang Yuan and others, he also pointed out that the fact that the Transportation Control Committee did not notify the customs of the import permit was a major source of corruption. Zhang Baohui testified that he did not participate in the food basket matter, and after learning about it, he advised Yue Jianmin not to get involved in the galvanized iron sheet declaration matter. However, he accepted a bribe of $1,500 in American dollars after the fact. Zhang Yuan testified that he participated in corruption several times because he owed Yang Shude money and was instructed by him to do so. He also said that the alteration of the permit for the Minfu Company caustic soda case was done by the merchant, and he only found out later. Yue Xinmin testified that he was forced to do so by the middleman. The arguments began at about five o'clock. Nine lawyers spoke one after another. The main purpose of their arguments was to emphasize the crimes of the bribers and exonerate the bribed, and to make the main culprits accomplices. The court adjourned at six o'clock. After dinner, the hearing of the bribery part continued. The testimonies of the criminals were mostly mutual accusations, and it was difficult to justify themselves. The arguments were completed until 11:00 PM late at night, and the hearing was announced to be concluded. Among the relatives of the criminals listening in on the sidelines during the interrogation, there were many modern young women, who did not leave from morning to night. Li Xicheng, the director of the Military Law Department of the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, who was in charge of the investigation of the case, was also present throughout.

### Reliving Old Dreams Leads to a Bloodshed: Two People Injured in the Dark

[Report from our Newspaper] Liu Yigui from Shandong, who is over forty years old, became acquainted with Du Wenmei (26 years old), a young woman from the same hometown, two years ago and lived with her at No. 43, Xiaotaoyuan Lane, Qianjiatang, Shaanxi South Road. Du used to have a lover named She Zhiliang, who was an unemployed vagrant. He later joined the army and recently returned to Shanghai. He met Du Wenmei again and relived old dreams. After a long time, Liu discovered it and expressed great dissatisfaction. He had several quarrels with Wenmei. (At 12:30 AM yesterday, Liu returned from outside and caught them in adultery, and knew that She Zhiliang had a handgun. He believed that he was suspected of being a bandit, so he went out to report to the nearby police kiosk. Police officer Zhou Muqing, No. 72 (27 years old, from Zhuji), together with another police officer, rushed to the scene. As soon as they entered the gate, they were discovered by Zhiliang, who mistook them for Liu Yigui's return. He held a kitchen knife in his hand and hid behind the door. Zhou rushed in first and was slashed in the neck. After being injured, Zhou was furious and fired a shot, hitting Du Zhiliang's right leg. Du also disregarded everything and slashed wildly with the knife, hitting Zhou's head and the right side of his neck about eight or nine times. He was finally arrested by another police officer. Du was first sent to the Red Cross Hospital for bandaging, and then, together with police officer Zhou Muqing, they were sent to the 界 (French Concession) police hospital for treatment. The Changshu Police Bureau is investigating this case.

### Depicting the Scandalous Behavior of the Foreign Dancing Girl: Shen Gongwei's Wife Files a Supplementary Complaint

Husband Unfaithful, Parents-in-Law Tolerant

[Report from our Newspaper] The color scandal between the red dance girl "Foreign Dancing Girl" Li Zhen and Shen Fawie is currently under investigation by the District Procuratorate. Shen's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, filed a supplementary complaint with the District Procuratorate yesterday, describing the affair between Shen and Li in detail. The complaint stated: "Around 6:00 PM in early August of last year, the defendant, dance girl Li Zhen, and Shen Gongwei came to my house in a car. The car stopped outside the gate. Shen went inside, claiming to change clothes. The complainant saw Li sitting alone in the car waiting. She reproached her for not enticing a married man. Li angrily drove away. After a quarter of an hour, she came back in a car and eventually invited Shen to go with her. At midnight, they came back in a car. Shen went upstairs and lured the complainant to the garden. In front of Li, after scolding her, he slapped the complainant's face to show his revenge. Then he left with Li in the car. Since then, he would scold and beat her at every turn. On the 18th of this month, Shen used a sarcastic tone to ask the complainant to agree to a divorce. When he did not get what he wanted, he said that he would shoot the complainant to death with a handgun. In the afternoon of the 19th, the complainant returned home with her sister-in-law. A maid was waiting at the entrance, saying that the young master really brought a handgun back today, preparing to kill the young mistress. The old master and old mistress were afraid that he would cause trouble and told us to take care of the young mistress and not let her in, so she quickly returned to her mother's house to avoid danger. At that time, the complainant did not understand why he was preparing to commit violence at home, why his parents would not control him, she had no choice but to temporarily return to her mother's house. The next night (the 20th), she expected Shen to be out and took the opportunity to retrieve her clothes and inquire about the details. As soon as she entered the gate, a servant came to warn her, preventing the complainant from going to the mistress's room. The second young master and Miss Li were staying inside, and the mistress had moved out. Only then did she realize that her parents-in-law were also tolerating them sleeping together at home. Such shameless behavior was unbearable, so she reported it to the police station and asked them to send policemen to her house to catch them in adultery. When they arrived, the door was locked and the whole house was dark and silent. Police officer Chang ordered the complainant to knock on the door. After a quarter of an hour, Shen got up, put on his clothes, and opened the door, while Li Zhen was still lying in bed, unwilling to get up. After the police officer ordered the complainant to remove the quilt, it was only then that Li was seen wearing only her underwear, her ugly appearance fully exposed, and the adultery was obvious. It should not be allowed to use drunkenness to cover up her crime and excuse her responsibility. The complainant is a weak woman who has always been oppressed and abused by him, suffering both physically and mentally. She has a daughter who is only two years old, and a son who is still in swaddling clothes. If she does not receive legal protection, the future of the complainant and her children is unimaginable. Their behavior is shameless, they disregard the law, indulge in licentiousness, and act recklessly, which will inevitably lead to a tragedy. Therefore, she filed a complaint, and the evidence of the crimes of interfering with the family, defrauding property, and coercing divorce committed by the defendants is conclusive. She begged the court to investigate and prosecute them to rectify social mores."

### Dong Changzhi Road Robbery Case Cracked: Fourteen Robbers Arrested One After Another

[Report from our Newspaper] The Detective Section of the Municipal Police Bureau recently arrested a batch of robbers, totaling fourteen, and recovered a large number of stolen goods, mostly gold jewelry and clothing. The investigation of the case was finally concluded yesterday, and it is scheduled to be transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation tomorrow. It is reported that at 11:00 AM on the 12th of this month, the police station received a report that a robbery had occurred at No. 61, Lane 753, Dong Changzhi Road. Section Chief Li Junhou of the Detective Section personally led all the members of the Second Unit and the "Flying Fortress" to the scene. As a result, the robbers had already escaped. Only two boxes of cashmere, Tianjin vegetables, and white gauze rope left by the robbers were found at the scene. The robbers often used gifts as a way to gain access. These remaining items were all gifts and items used to tie up the victims. Afterwards, Li ordered all the members of the section to investigate carefully. On the morning of the 14th, it was discovered that a person named Little Chen was appearing in the area of Kaifeng Road and Xizang Road, who usually did not do honest work and behaved quite lavishly, and resembled one of the robbers at the scene described by the victim of the case. Unit Chief Feng Qishan led officers Ma Bingzhang, Zhang Jianyun, Guo Yufeng, Gao Fuhai, etc., to wait for him. At noon, Chen was arrested near the bridge on Xizang Road. He confessed that his name was Chen Shirong, 34 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 69, Yonghe Lane, Kaifeng Road. However, he flatly denied participating in the robbery. After the victim came to the police station to identify him, he was subjected to fatigue interrogation. After two days and nights, he finally confessed on the 17th that he had committed the crime with his accomplices Huang Afan, Old Li, and Chen Lizhong. Except for Chen Lizhong, who lived at No. 363, Hongan Lane, Haining Road, the others only knew that Old Li lived on Yongshou Street, but the house number was unknown, and Huang Afan had a girlfriend surnamed Chen, who was an actress at the Queen Yue Theater on Xizang Road. After the police officers received the confession, they set out to investigate in batches. Except for the Chen criminal who had fled after hearing the news, Huang was arrested at the home of Chen Jinlian (No. 108, Dingxing Road), a veteran actor at the Queen Theater. He confessed that he was 34 years old, worked as a butcher, and lived at Zhenji Meat Shop at No. 40, Guangxi South Road. He also confessed that his accomplice Old Li lived in a three-story pavilion room at No. 91, Yongshou Street. He was immediately arrested and a portion of the stolen gold jewelry was found in his room. Li confessed that his other name was Wang Xiangyue, and that he had an accomplice named Guo Zhongren, who lived at No. 1, Baojianfang, Wengjia Lane, Nanshi, and had three firearms and bullets hidden there. After the police officers received the confession, they immediately dispatched the Flying Fortress to surround Guo's house overnight. He was arrested in the pavilion room of the house, and three handguns and twenty-two bullets were found under his bed. After being taken to the police station for interrogation, he confessed to ten other accomplices in another case: Chen Zuxing, Xia Gentao, Yang Zaixing, Ma Wanxiang, Dong Dejun, Zhang Yingming, Qiu Hegao, Chen Qiaoqi, Yao Jiaju, and Yang Menglin. They were arrested one after another, and a handgun was found in Qiu Hegao's residence.

### The Triangle Area of the Great Wall, Yellow River, and Mongolian Banner Region: The Suffering on the Borders of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan

[Our Newspaper, Baotou, 22nd Dispatch] At the end of the 36th year, Qi Zhizhong, the Security Commander of Jungar Banner in Yikezhao League, and Zhu Wumei, the Administrative Commissioner of the Eighth District of Shanxi and County Magistrate of Hequ, led local troops and simultaneously advanced into western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi to relieve the neighboring provinces' distress. Qi Zhizhong did not drive straight down from the north to Fugu but instead crossed the river and recovered Hequ County. Zhu Wumei did not return to Hequ from the west but instead entered the Great Wall and captured Fugu. While their actions are commendable politically, they clearly made the mistake of being unfamiliar with the local terrain militarily. The Communists took advantage of the vacuum in the military zone on the borders of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan, exchanging two persimmons that had been sucked dry for eight large apples in the desert.

After the capture of Hequ and Fugu, telegrams stating, "The city walls have been demolished, all able-bodied men have been conscripted, the people have been completely liquidated, and supplies are extremely difficult," kept coming, but there was no follow-up. Unexpectedly, starting on January 11th, the enemy launched a counterattack, using their main force to outflank and hide north of Hequ. Just as Qi Zhizhong and Zhu Wumei had withdrawn their troops to their original defenses, the Communist Third Combat Brigade crossed the frozen Guan River at Guankou. At dawn on the 16th, the Shili Changtan (Ten-Li Long Beach) was attacked first. By the night of the 18th, the situation had deteriorated further. The most important commercial towns on the borders of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan, except for Shenshan and Suoshui, including Shili Changtan and Mazha in Hequ, and Hala Village, Madigou, Gucheng, Shaji, and Chiger in Fugu, and Shagedu and Nalin and Wuzhimao in Jugar Banner, had all fallen into enemy hands. The situation in the triangle area of the Great Wall, Yellow River, and Mongolian Banner region is still extremely serious. As of the time this report was filed, only Shagedu and Nalin had been retaken. The other towns are being burned, looted, and massacred by the Communist troops.

These several commercial towns that the Communists have invaded are difficult to find on ordinary maps. However, their economic value surpasses that of any existing town or village in the four regions of southern Suiyuan, western Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, and Yikezhao League. These towns have nearly 100 years of trade history between the Mongols and the Han people, and they are located on the western bank of the Yellow River.

Water transportation on the western bank of the Yellow River is extremely convenient. Although it declined for more than ten years after the PingSui Railway opened, it gradually recovered its former prosperity after wealthy families from northern Shaanxi and western Shanxi began to be forced into commercial activities in Jungar Banner due to the Red Terror starting in 1934. The political environment in this area is also very special. On one side is Hequ, Shanxi, which implements a unified military-agricultural system, on another side is Fugu, Shaanxi, which organizes Baojia, and on the other side is Jungar Banner, which has "Dadu" and "Dargu" (i.e., the system of ambans and associate ambans) organizations. Therefore, the Communists are coveting it and eager to infiltrate from the outside.

The three provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan originally took the Yellow River and the Great Wall as the boundary. The western district of Hequ and the northern district of Fugu were formerly pastures of Jungar Banner. Only after droughts in western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi in the 33rd year of the Kangxi Emperor did immigrants cross the river to cultivate the land. The Mongolian Banner only collected land rent and did not manage the administration of the settlers, which was still under the jurisdiction of Hequ and Fugu. Mazha in Hequ is located close to the Yellow River, ten li from the county seat. Horses from the Mongolian Banner that were brought into Shanxi all crossed the river at this location, hence the name Mazha (Horse Fence). The local area is a center for agricultural production and manufacturing, with many oil and wine workshops. It is surrounded by earthen hills on the west and low, flat, and damp land on the river's edge on the east. Vegetable and fruit gardening are very developed. Before the opening of the PingSui Railway, there were also shipbuilding yards. Shili Changtan is the center of the western district of Hequ, relying on the main roads to Baotou and the Hetao region.

The shops are lined up closely, and the market is prosperous. It is a distribution location for oil and grain and wool exchanges. Even in the ruins, one can still see carved beams and painted buildings. After the Shanxi New Army mutiny in 1940, the Hequ County government moved here, making it look like a county seat.

Hala Village in Fugu is the industrial center of the Shanxi-Shaanxi-Suiyuan border. The wool carpets produced there are famous in the Northwest. There are also workshops for making cowhide boots, mutton knives, silver bowls and chopsticks, and headdresses for Mongolian women. The architecture is entirely in the style of the interior. The Zhenwu Temple in the north of the town is three zhang high. From its height, the whole town looks like a phoenix, so it is also called Phoenix Town. During the Anti-Japanese War, General Ma Zhanshan was stationed here, and his soldiers used mud to refresh all the dilapidated buildings, giving the town a very uplifting atmosphere. Madigou faces Hequ County across the river. In the spring of 1938, after the Shanxi New Army mutiny, the shops and wealthy families of Hequ moved here to

exchange materials with the Communist troops in western Shanxi. Personnel from all sides have established intelligence agencies here, with about 20 radio stations. The Communists use gold, silver, and sand in Madigou to obtain our furs and salt. Therefore, it is known as the Golden Market. It leads the prices of goods in all areas of Yikezhao League. Therefore, newspaper reporters often use "red, yellow, blue, white, and black" to describe the filth and filth of this suddenly rich village. The towns of Shagedu and Nalin in Jungar Banner are in the defense area of Security Commander Qi Zhizhong. Across the river from Shagedu is Yangjiawan, where Qi Zhizhong's magnificent residence is located. His grandfather, Nasendalai, was a great politician, great military strategist, and great economist of Jungar Banner, leading the Banner for more than 30 years. Shagedu is a commercial town opened up by Nasendalai himself, hence the name "Nagongsuo." There is a market fair every three, six, and nine days. Yangjiawan was looted by Wang Ying in 1927, but this did not cause the Qi family to decline. During the Anti-Japanese War, the supplies for Ma Zhanshan's Fifth Cavalry Division were supplied by the Qi family! The firearms of the three regiments of security troops he now leads were entirely purchased out of his own pocket. Nalin is north of Shagedu. Nearby are the ruins of the ancient city of "Hongzhou." This commercial town thrives by relying on Baotou. There are hotels and bathhouses in the town, making it the "Shanghai" of Yikezhao League and also known as "Little Baotou." The town is even busier than Dongsheng, Helin, and Qingshuihe.

Shenshan, Suoshui, and Wuzhiwan are in the defense area of Qi Yongquan, the First Garrison Commander of Yikezhao League and Director of the Jungar Banner Affairs Reorganization Committee. His mansion and headquarters and the committee are all located in Shenshan. The

terrain is dangerous. Shenshan is as high as five huali. On a clear day, one can see Hequ and Pianguan County in Hedong and Mount Qilan. Qi Yongquan's home is at the bottom of this mountain. Qi Zu Qiwening succeeded Nasendalai in ruling Jungar Banner. There are many shops in Suoshui Town, with a total of more than 3,000 elite cavalry troops. Therefore, the Communist attack on Shenshan was blocked, and Suoshui was preserved, only Wuzhiwan was lost. Suoshui is 80 li west of Dongsheng, and Wuzhiwan is 10 li south of Hala Village. Markets are held on the first, fourth, and seventh and second, fifth, and eighth days of the month, and business is second only to Hala Village and Nalin. This year in Yikezhao League,

the entire region is arid. Only the eastern area along the river has a slight autumn harvest. All the princes' residences in each Banner, except for the Prince of the Junwang Banner, have been looted by mutinous soldiers. This Communist invasion of Jungar Banner has created widespread poverty and hunger in Yikezhao League. Since 1939, wealthy families from western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi have regarded Jungar Banner as a paradise for refuge. After Yulin experienced two encirclements, many merchants also moved to Shagedu, Nalin, and other places, without crossing the river to Suiyuan and Baotou. This time, the Communist troops advanced in three routes: one route went north from Fugu to attack Hala Village and Wuzhiwan, one route crossed the river from Mazha to Shagedu and Nalin, and one route detoured from Guankou to Shili Changtan. If the merchants cannot evacuate calmly, the economic losses will be extremely large. If this group of Communist troops is not eliminated in the short term, the 300,000 starving people in Yikezhao League are likely to launch a rebellion in the rear of the Chahar-Suiyuan Field Army, which cannot but be given more vigilance!

### Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang: Ministry of Education Allocates Funds for Renovation, New Discovery of Tang Dynasty Murals

[Our Newspaper] The Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang were established during the Jianyuan era of the Former Qin Dynasty, and more than 1,500 years have passed since then. In 1943, the Ministry of Education established a research institute and built a one-kilometer-long wall. Later, due to financial constraints during the war, the work of repairing the caves could not be carried out. Last year, the Ministry of Education allocated 100 million yuan for the repair of the caves, and the institute has been actively rushing to repair them. It is reported that the area of the Mogao Grottoes is vast, and some repair work must be carried out on cliffs and steep walls, making it extremely difficult to draw water and fetch soil. According to statistics, since the start of construction in April, which has lasted for eight months, more than 300 caves have been repaired, as well as more than 700 meters of corridors and walls, more than 20 bridge corridors, and two sand walls, including four wooden structures from the late Tang Dynasty and the Five Dynasties and Song Dynasty that were in imminent danger. It is also learned that in August, when the institute repaired the earth platform of Cave 227, it discovered three Sui Dynasty caves with murals and donor inscriptions that had been buried since the early Qing Dynasty, as well as two Tang Dynasty caves. In addition, two complete Tang Dynasty murals and inscriptions discovered in the double walls are all unexpected gains from this repair work. Currently, two new double-walled caves have been discovered and are open for exhibition. The rest are being cleared by the institute and will be open to the public for viewing in the spring.

### Tidbits from the Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 24th Dispatch] After two years of life as a reporter, only circling within the ancient city of Hefei, I felt unusually depressed. Recently, due to business in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, it was like a bird escaping its cage, and my mind was greatly opened. I will report my impressions as follows:

On the way to Heishui. Early on the 19th in Peixian County, I took a Huainan Coal Mine truck and sped northeast along the Huainan Road that had been demolished by the enemy. Looking around, the two wheat crops, which had only been moistened once by a heavy snow after a long drought, were just sprouting, slightly showing their heads, embellishing the vitality of the vast yellow fields. The withered thatched villages swept past, sparsely wooded, still a desolate scene. Due to the long-term disrepair of the roadbed, the car traveled up and down bumpy, causing dizziness! I almost vomited! After Shuangdunji, I met the Huainan Road repair survey car with red flags waving. People in the car said: When the railway is repaired in June or July, the pain of bumps can be avoided! At twelve o'clock, I arrived at Shuijiahu. There were originally only about 20 thatched hotels here. It was inconvenient for passengers to have lunch and wait for the bus. Recently, the road authorities have built a bright and clean reception center, stipulating that the price of each meal is 30,000 yuan and the price of tea is 3,000 yuan, which are both clean and delicious. However, passengers on southbound trains often swarm up before passengers on northbound trains get off, scrambling to carry luggage, and the order is unusually chaotic! The police did not stop it, and this point should be improved.

On the Shuibeng train. At 3:00 PM, the whistle sounded, and the southbound train from Huainan rumbled into the station, swallowing a large number of passengers and spitting out northbound passengers. However, joint transport tickets are limited to sitting in cold, seatless iron freight cars, so most passengers changed to second class, temporarily making up the ticket price of 36,000 yuan, causing disputes. The procedure is too complicated. This point seems to be stipulated in advance and the price of changing to second class should be improved. The train traveled too slowly. After passing Wudian, it was delayed for a long time due to watering. With a 70-kilometer journey, it did not reach Bengbu until the lights of thousands of homes were on. Passengers said: It is like taking a bullock cart, which can be seen.

Bengbu Inspection. Bengbu is the tail of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. After a long period of construction after the victory, it has restored the prosperity of the pre-war mountains. On the 20th, I made a tour of the city. The middle section of Er Malu and Huachang Street are wide and flat, and the city is prosperous. Under the flashing lights and neon lights at night, it is especially lively. The social hall of the Social Service Department, which stands tall, is full of singing, making people forget their fatigue: The Great Horse Road is also wide, but it is mostly a business of northern goods, and the road surface is bumpy. Once it encounters dangerous rain, it is muddy! Relatively inferior: The Huai River on the south side of the city is full of sails, and the masts are like bamboo shoots, swallowing and spitting upstream and downstream, and the goods are piled up like mountains, which is the main reason for the prosperity of Bengbu: The reporter has successively visited Mayor Li Pinhe, Speaker Xiang Yuncheng of the Municipal Council, and Chairman Liu Huaxuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who told me: This year, the city's commerce, calculated in national currency, has a surplus, and some have made dozens of times the profit, sweeping away the depressed image of last year's closure, but calculated in goods, there are very few that exceed the original number. Bengbu's recent cost of living index can be compared to that of Beijing and Shanghai, with rice reaching 2.4 million yuan per stone, and flour from factories such as Shixing is rising sharply! Each bag has reached 650,000 yuan, and civil servants and ordinary people cannot afford it. The Bengbu District Rice Donation Office, which was newly established by the provincial government for the Shou Anjing security expenses, started to levy a 6% rice donation on the 17th, which is still going smoothly.

A Glimpse of Guzhen. Guzhen is a key town because of the haze and is the town where the Xubeng problem exists. The street is about two li long, and the business is good. It is a place that soldiers must compete for. It runs through the east and west. The Hui River along the coast of Shangqiu upstream and Wuhe downstream was flooded in the summer, but the fields were not flooded. The wheat, mung beans, sorghum, and other difficult grains harvested were purchased and exported by grain merchants from Wuxi, Kunshan, and other places, reaching 450 tons. There is currently a shortage of food, and the price of rice has risen sharply, reaching 4.2 million yuan per stone and wheat 4 million yuan. Each day, more than 100 stones of rice flour are imported from Chuxian, Mingguang, Bengbu, and other places. The only exports are tobacco leaves, wine, pigs, and cattle. The trade deficit is huge! In the northeast, there are often indigenous Communist activities, and the self-defense force is weak. The Lingbi County government has recently established a joint defense area office in the town, appointing Wang Zhujiu as the district chief, and is raising funds locally to purchase weapons and ammunition.

Recent Appearance of Sixian. Sixian is a large county in northeastern Anhui, with a population of 1.3 million, second only to Hefei and Fuyang. The city walls are about ten li in circumference, and the buildings are magnificent. The moat around the city is like a belt, unusually solid! Last year on the Mid-Autumn Festival, more than 10,000 Communist bandits suddenly came to attack, having already occupied the outside of the southeast and west gates, but they were still beaten to a pulp by a small number of paratroopers cooperating with local troops, running away with their heads in their arms. Most of it was due to the strength of the city; The southeast and south townships of the county were also flooded in the summer. The miscellaneous grains harvested in the northwest townships, such as sesame, wheat, soybeans, tea beans, and sorghum, were also purchased and exported by grain merchants from Wuxi, Kunshan, and other places, reaching 600 tons. The existing grain has been emptied, and grain prices have risen, with rice reaching 320,000 per dou and wheat 300,000 (Sixian's old dou is 33 jin, and Guzhen's is 47 jin), and sorghum is 300,000. Therefore, it has evolved into a reverse flow. Each day, about 200 shi of rice and flour are imported from Bengbu, Chu, Ming, and other places. The only exported goods are sesame oil, wine, cattle, and sheepskins, which are not enough to exchange for the price. It is the same as Guzhen. According to various groups in the county, there are already 300,000 people in this territory who are urgently looking forward to the early dredging of the Tanhe River between Jiangsu and Anhui, so that they can use food-for-work flour to maintain their lives. The famine next spring will be a serious problem! The county belongs to the Fourth District of Anhui Province. Recently, due to the problem of the election of legislators, Councilor Ma Jingchang and Xia Changtang, Director of the Provincial Government's Beijing Office, are competing in the election, and the city has suddenly become more lively; In the northeast township, there is currently the Communist Twelfth Brigade cooperating with the local Communist Party to carry out activities, but the garrison has the 24th Division, and parts of the 58th Division and the Traffic Police Brigade and Mechanical Corps, with strict defenses, and there is no problem with public security. There are a total of eight secondary schools and more than 250 primary schools in the county, and education is relatively developed, but there are too many primary school graduates each semester, and secondary schools are not enough to accommodate them.

### Strange Events in Taipei Labor Unrest: Camphor Oil Price Exceeds Gold, Actually Poured into Gutters

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 27th Dispatch] The Jingwu authorities confirmed that the camphor company workers poured intermediate oil from the factory into the gutters and into the Tamsui River because their request for a wage increase was not granted. After it was discovered and salvaged, four tons were found to be missing. Although it was not pure camphor oil, the number of losses is shocking. At the same time, a case of stealing and selling more than ten tons of camphor has occurred and is being thoroughly investigated. Camphor is a special product, with a price exceeding gold. The company's management needs to be improved and strengthened urgently.

### Minister Zhu Jia-hua Returned to the Provincial Capital Yesterday, Highly Praising the Educational Facilities in Taiwan

Planning to Hold a Cultural Relics Exhibition in Taiwan Hosted by the Ministry of Education

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 27th] After inspecting Taiwan, Minister of Education Zhu Jia-hua returned to the capital via Shanghai on the 27th. According to his published remarks: The education at all levels in Taiwan is progressing steadily, and the promotion of the national language is particularly rapid and widespread, which is commendable. During this trip to Taiwan, I gained a deeper impression of Taiwan's education: People in Taiwan are all devoted to education and have a particular understanding of the facilities of the old education system. The equipment of schools at all levels can reach a permanent standard, and the school ethos is orderly and solemn. The average educational expenditure in each county and city will reach 35%. National education can be said to be universal. Taiwan's schools at all levels and social education can cooperate with the needs of the country and society. Based on this foundation, enriching and promoting it will truly enable the country to benefit from it and the society to benefit from it. The teachers in Taiwan's schools are conscientious and responsible, with a very good spirit of service. The young students are simple and honest, diligent in their studies and self-disciplined, and have a good academic style. However, Taiwan has been occupied for a long time, and the Japanese rule was harsh, suppressing the development of high-level talents. Young students inevitably have some estrangement from their motherland's culture. The teachers and teaching materials in schools also urgently need to be enriched. This time, I conducted a more detailed inspection in Taiwan, and I will gather opinions from all parties and actively plan improvements based on the information obtained. In addition, after Mr. Zhu's return, he plans to first hold a "Cultural Relics Exhibition" in Taiwan under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, invite famous experts to give lectures, and award grants to scholars and educators from Taiwan to give lectures and conduct research in the mainland. As for other institutions in Taiwan borrowing school buildings for offices, he also plans to consult with the Taiwan authorities to order their relocation.

It is reported that local educational administrative agencies intend to limit the schools under their jurisdiction to purchase certain designated textbooks, which is inappropriate. It is hoped that this will be strictly prohibited.

### Retirement Pension and Bereavement Payment for School Teachers and Staff

Draft Regulations Passed by the Political Affairs Conference

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 27th] The draft regulations on retirement and bereavement payments for school teachers and staff were passed at the Political Affairs Conference on the 27th and will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. The main points are as follows: (A) Retirement Section: Those who have served for more than 15 years and are over 60 years old, or those who have served for more than 30 years, may apply for retirement and be given a retirement pension. The provision of retirement pensions is roughly divided into several types: Those who have served for more than 15 years but less than 20 years and voluntarily apply for retirement will be given 45% of their "annual retirement pension." The calculation of the "annual retirement pension" is based on the annual salary calculated from the monthly salary at the time of retirement. Those who should retire within this time limit can be given 50% of their "annual retirement pension." Those who have served for 20 to 25 years will be given 50% of their "annual retirement pension" if they voluntarily apply for retirement, and 55% of their "annual retirement pension" if they should retire. Those who have served for more than 25 years will be given 55% if they voluntarily apply, and 60% if they should retire. Those who have served for 30 years and are over 60 years old will be given 60% if they voluntarily apply. Those who have served for 15 years and are over 60 years old and are injured on duty will receive an additional one-time retirement pension equivalent to 4, 6, or 8 months, in addition to this "annual retirement pension." (B) Bereavement Payment Section: Those who have served for 15 years will be given 30% of their "annual bereavement payment," those who have served for 20 years will be given 40%, those who have served for 25 years will be given 45%, and those who have served for 30 years will be given 50%. The calculation of the "annual bereavement payment" is based on the annual salary calculated from the monthly salary. If death is due to an official duty, an additional 10% will be added.

### Scholarships: Various Organizations Are Eager to Donate, Reaching 7.97 Billion

The Mayor and Others Hosted Reporters to Discuss Fundraising Principles

[Our Dispatch] The municipal government authorities believe that the amount of tuition fees for the next semester is huge, and students from poor families will be unable to afford them. They have initiated the organization of a Unified Review Committee for Scholarships for Poor Students to raise scholarships to solve the problem of poor students continuing their education. Mayor Wu Guozhen and Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu jointly hosted reporters in the city government auditorium at 5 PM yesterday to report on the principles of scholarship fundraising and the general situation.

Fundraising Work to be Handled in a Unified Manner

Mayor Wu first reported on the organizational purpose of the Unified Review Committee for Scholarships for Poor Students, which is to seek guarantees for poor students to continue their studies. The Unified Review Committee is scheduled to be formally established on the 24th of this month (next Tuesday). Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, and Chairman Fang from the previous session will continue to be responsible, with a tentative goal of 10 billion. It is hoped that all sectors will respond enthusiastically and exceed the target. The municipal government hopes that this scholarship fundraising work can be handled in a unified manner, avoiding divisions. Although the various schools are handling it automatically, it is feared that the donations will not be evenly distributed and there will inevitably be repeated donations, causing the outside world to complain. The mayor receives an average of 100 to 200 private letters from citizens every day. Therefore, I believe that unified handling can have three advantages: Avoid repeated fundraising; Distribute evenly to all schools; Prevent corruption. The municipal government has sent letters to the various schools to solicit their opinions. If any insist on handling it individually, they will not be eligible to receive allocations after the unified scholarship fund is raised. And before deciding to handle it on their own, they must publicly solicit the opinions of all the students, and only after the signatures of the majority of the students have been obtained can they declare their decision.

Strict Prohibition of Punishment for School Strikes

Commander Xuan then stated: In the past three months, the security situation in this city has been very good. Although there are many citizens who cannot live in peace, it is gratifying that no major chaos has occurred in this city. And statistics show that the number of cases of releasing thieves is also less than in previous years. But the only two things that the military and political authorities find regrettable are: Recently, there have been labor-capital disputes due to year-end bonus issues, leading to strikes and go-slows; A few schools arbitrarily hold sit-ins due to internal problems, disrupting school order, which inevitably affects other schools. I believe that the country has ordered the implementation of constitutional government. In order for the country to embark on a truly rule-of-law path, those in power must serve the people everywhere, and the people should also have a full spirit of obeying the law. Any behavior that disrupts social order should be cracked down on. The military and political authorities have unanimously decided: In the future, all acts such as sit-ins and strikes will be strictly prohibited and punished.

Therefore, it was changed to the strong A-group team Green Forest to meet the enemy.

Light is invincible in Jiangxi Province. Its strength is well-known in Central China. In particular, the performance in the battle against Hubei was even more well-received. This time, they came east to observe and learn. Tonight, they will show their skills for the first time and do their best to perform.

The young players of Green Forest have maintained their winning streak in the A group of the current league and have the ambition to win the championship.

### Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Education Formulate Three Handling Methods for Students Changing Their Domicile

[Our Dispatch] There are no clear provisions in the "Household Registration Law" and its implementing rules for the procedures for students to request changes in their domicile. Recently, in view of the large number of students and graduates at all levels of schools requesting changes in their domicile due to changes in their place of origin, the Ministry of Education believes that it is necessary to consider the principles of changing domicile in order to provide relief and show restrictions. Together with the Ministry of Interior, based on the meaning of "registering" and "deregistering" under the Household Registration Law, the following three handling methods for students requesting changes in their domicile have been formulated: Students at all levels of schools who need to change the domicile recorded on their graduation certificate when their domicile changes must submit a copy of the household registration book from the township or district office of their original domicile, along with their graduation certificate, to the county or city government of their original domicile for review and submission to the superior government in charge for forwarding to the Ministry of Interior for approval. Graduates of schools at all levels who change their domicile should follow the procedures stipulated in the preceding paragraph, but before the Ministry of Interior approves, they may use a copy of the household registration book or national identity card to prove the current domicile to which they belong. Students and graduates of schools at all levels who have been approved by the Ministry of Interior to change their domicile should submit it to the original school for reporting to the competent educational administrative authority for record.

### Tongji Medical College Professors Urge Students to Resume Classes Immediately

Students Make Final Efforts Today, Hoping for Understanding from the School

[Our Dispatch] The Tongji University student strike has been going on for a long time. Yesterday, according to a professor from the school who participated in the meeting with Minister Zhu Jiahua the day before yesterday: After listening to President Ding Wenyan's report, Minister Zhu believed that this student movement in the school was not comparable to general school strikes and had serious political implications.

They all believed that the strike of some students of the college was affected by the strikes of other colleges. The professors should take a detached attitude based on their love for the school and students and request the school to quickly stop the student strike with effective methods. After a three-hour discussion, the following proposals were made: To continue to adopt individual persuasion methods and issue a letter to the students, pointing out the students' wrong motives and ordering them to attend classes immediately; If persuasion is ineffective, in accordance with the first proposal, the school is requested to severely punish students who do not attend classes and refuse to move back to the Medical College for accommodation; In the name of all the professors of the Medical College, invite all the professors of the university to hold a symposium at the Public Training Alumni Association on Jing'an Temple Road at 3 PM tomorrow to exchange opinions.

### Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Yarn and Cloth Management: Cotton Spinning Industry Studies in Groups

Stationed Plant Commissioners Still Awaiting Further Negotiations Between the Two Parties

[Our Report] At 4:00 PM yesterday, Director Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee convened all the Standing Directors of the Cotton Spinning Associations in the six districts for a meeting. The directors requested that the detailed rules for the implementation of yarn and cloth management be postponed and first distributed to the industry for research to avoid difficulties in implementation and affecting the survival of the textile industry. As a result of the earnest discussions, Director Yuan accepted the principle of contributing opinions from the industry, but stated that the detailed rules will be announced on February 1st and will be unofficially handed over to the directors for research. The six district associations have scheduled to convene meetings of the raw cotton and yarn/cloth groups today to study the detailed rules in detail to provide opinions. It is reported that the matter of stationed plant commissioners is still awaiting further negotiations between the two parties.

### Unified Purchase of Cotton Begins, Cotton Yarn Registered Simultaneously

[Another Report] After being ordered to manage the national yarn and cloth, the Yarn Control Committee immediately began actively preparing for the implementation work. It is reported that because the unified purchase of cotton is a matter of urgency, the committee has formulated detailed rules for the implementation of unified cotton purchase, submitted them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and selected three important regions, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou, for implementation first. Within the above-mentioned areas, all cotton yarn transportation and transshipment must be based on the transportation certificate issued by the committee. Cotton without a certificate will be severely punished once discovered. The committee also issued a circular to relevant agencies, urging them to do their best to assist.

In addition, in order to understand the status of cotton yarn production, sales, and storage, and to effectively prevent hoarding, the committee has agreed on a method for registering cotton yarn, which will be implemented first in Shanghai and gradually extended to the whole country. All cotton yarn stored in this city should be registered with the committee within the specified time limit: It is stipulated that the registration period is from the 29th of this month to the 6th of February. Each yarn factory should complete the inventory procedures for all stored yarn as of the 31st of this month, and submit a list to the committee before February 3rd, indicating the brand, count, and quantity for general registration. Only after the committee issues a registration certificate can the yarn be allowed to leave the factory. Subsequently, when reporting to customs for transshipment to other ports, the registration certificate must also be submitted for verification before release.

### Chips are Flooding, Elimination is Minimal: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Both Weaken

Spot Cotton Buyers are Watching, Transactions are Silent

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation was that the market was full of chips due to the large amount released by the Textile Construction Company every other day. The Tianjin and other gangs were very slack because the total closing date was approaching. The industry colleagues in this street were all watching because the money supply was not loose. There was also selling at high prices, but the profit-taking transactions in the middle were active, and the price was not allowed to plummet. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1.5 million compared to the previous time, at 58.3 million yuan. The remaining coarse and fine yarns also fell by 500,000 to 2 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was that the elimination by the local and foreign gangs was minimal. Moreover, it was the time for the Textile Construction Company to release cloth, and the market was full of chips. Buyers were approaching the total closing date, and those with tight funds were mostly selling goods for cash, so the market went downstream. As a result, 12-pound fine cloth all fell by 20,000 to 40,000 yuan. In addition, the coarse twill and bleached fine twill also fell by 10,000 to 40,000 or 50,000 yuan, but colored cloth and native calico cloth remained stable.

Textile Construction Sells Cloth

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,740 pieces and 80 sheets. There were 29 application forms, of which two were from manufacturers, purchasing 400 pieces, and the rest were purchased by various cloth shops.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market situation was that transactions were quiet again due to the tightening of the money supply and buyers watching. Moreover, with the cotton yarn and cloth weakening, people were gloomy, and few transactions were made. The Textile Construction Company did not announce prices, and the industry colleagues were all in a hurry for funds, and the purchase was not opened, and only 200 bales of fire cotton were transacted. The price for delivery at the docks was 4.795 million yuan, and Zhoupu cotton seeds were 1.24 million yuan.

### Purchasing Uncertified Foreign Cotton, Exchanging for Yarn and Cloth

[Our Report] The Textile Machinery and Product Export Committee held its second committee meeting last Thursday to review the progress of its business and made a number of resolutions. It is reported that the following resolutions are related to manufacturers:

The Indian government's announcement that the export of cotton fiber of 13/16 inches or more is prohibited will affect the promotion of future business and the supply of raw cotton. How should countermeasures be planned? It was resolved to contact other cotton-producing countries to supplement.

Cotton exchanged at a price of 20% of the second part (that is, half of 20% of the yarn factory's production volume) will be converted at the dock delivery price.

The cotton yarn exchanged for Indian cotton contracts signed between this committee and importers and exporters originally stipulated that the cotton yarn should be shipped to India, but some requested to change the shipment to east of India. It is now stipulated that all cotton yarn shipped to east of India (that is, Southeast Asia) must be increased by 170 pounds of cotton in accordance with the original ratio. However, it should still be adjusted reasonably at any time depending on the market situation.

Regarding the purchase of uncertified foreign cotton arriving at the port, the 12th committee meeting of the previous year decided that the principle of exchanging cotton and yarn at the same time should be adopted during the exchange. The committee has also decided on the exchange target. If the applicant is a factory, the original applicant will be given priority for exchange. Recently, the factory stated at the meeting that there is a shortage of spot goods, and it is extremely difficult to exchange cotton and yarn at the same time. It was resolved that from the date when the bill of lading and import certificate are handed over to the manufacturer, all payments must be cleared within one month. If there is a delay in picking up the goods, the committee may be notified to grant a grace period as appropriate depending on the actual situation.

### Textile Construction Bids for Flying Flowers

[Our Report] According to a person in charge of the China Textile Construction Company, the company's bidding for flying flowers in the past has been very important to the Flying Flower Industry Association. Later, it was found that some industry colleagues were manipulating the bidding, so the Flying Flower Export Company's request to speak was also accepted at the same time. Recently, an open bidding method has been adopted to benefit all industries related to the need for flying flowers. Although the Flying Flower Industry Association stated that the industry should bid exclusively, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved that Textile Construction should ban bidding with a monopolistic nature and adopt an open bidding method to ensure fairness. Therefore, Textile Construction still adopted an open bidding method yesterday to sell flying flowers. As a result of the bidding, each industry won some flying flowers. The company stated that it will never ignore the legitimate interests of the flying flower industry. However, monopolistic manipulation should be banned in accordance with the ministry's orders.

According to general observations in the vegetable market, the weather is cold and the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the balance between supply and demand is slightly out of balance. It is expected that the rise will only increase.

### Uneven Process, Volatile Shanghai Stock Market

Shanghai stocks were volatile yesterday, shifting with the money supply. There was a rise in the middle, but transactions were limited and not sustainable. However, small stocks had a sudden rise, and the process of each stock was quite different.

At the opening in the morning, the spot delivery stocks fell more, while the deferred delivery stocks fell less because the foreign exchange rate was higher. Yongsha debuted at 734 yuan and 751 yuan, and after rising from 746 yuan and 755 yuan, it retreated to 736 yuan and 742 yuan.

The stock exchange announced yesterday: Broker Guo Wujiao, No. 202, and broker Ye Shuochen, No. 210, were both suspended from entering the market because their branch business management did not meet the regulations.

### Unified Bonds Weak, Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Public bonds continued to weaken yesterday. The unified Bing opened at 72,000 in the morning, retreated from 74,000 to 66,000, and then leveled off slightly.

### Stock Exchange Brokers Meeting Discusses Margin Issues

[Our Report] The Shanghai Stock Exchange Brokers Association held its 41st Standing Council meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Yu Mingshi discussed the matter of the Ministry of Finance and Economics ordering brokers to increase capital and increase margin. During the meeting, the opinion was that regarding the increase of margin, because the original deposit margin of each broker in the stock exchange was 50 million, of which 20 million was in cash and 30 million was in U.S. dollar securities. Calculated at today's foreign exchange market price of the National Bank, the value of the 30 million U.S. dollar securities has reached 357 million yuan. Including the original 20 million yuan in cash, the total amount of margin actually stored has reached 377 million yuan, which exceeds the regulations for increasing the total amount of margin to 200 million yuan. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to discuss it further. Regarding the increase of capital, the Standing Council believes that it is a matter for each broker itself, and the opinions of each member should be solicited before making a decision.

[Another Report] The Stock Exchange Brokers Association has scheduled to hold its annual general meeting on February 28th to report on the association's affairs over the past year, discuss promoting association affairs, and re-elect directors and supervisors.

### Food Rice Source is Not Smooth, White Japonica Sees New High Price

Yesterday, a total of more than 9,800 stones of food rice arrived in the north and south markets. The weather was extremely cold, and the rivers in the countryside were frozen, and the source was blocked. The inland market rebounded, and people's hearts tended to be firm. White japonica and early thin rice both rose rapidly by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and indica rice also increased by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. White yuan and yin yuan followed up by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. There were very few white japonica in the market that turned high, and most of them were in the middle and second grades. The market price of especially high-quality white japonica has exceeded the 1.5 million mark. Flour also continued to rise by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan due to the inland price increase and the large number of people seeking it. The factory flour was sold off at 50 bags per household, and the price remained unchanged. The bran owners were firm and rebounded by more than 10,000 yuan.

The trading of bean cake was sparse among the merchant gangs, and scattered households moved slightly, rebounding by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The merchant gangs purchased yellow beans, and the oil factories also wanted fragrant and dry beans. The customer beans rebounded by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and Du Huang's firm style. Mung beans were active in northern sales, and were clearly fixed and secretly tight. Red beans were collected in Hong Kong, and stepped up by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Cowpea moved in Southeast Asia, and advanced by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Broad beans were scattered and lively, and continued to rise by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

The arrival and storage of red sorghum were both small, and the Fujian stomach moved slightly, high and more solid, and then added 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Corn was still slack in the north, high and fixed, and secondary was tired. Sesame and vegetables were not moving in Tianjin, and the situation was stable. Raw peanuts were suspended in the Guang gang, and the street followed the expectation, and fell in a straight line, plummeting by more than 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

The oil market gradually circled, and soybean oil rose again by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Light oil and sesame oil both rose by 100,000 yuan, and vegetable oil also followed up by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Raw oil rose rapidly by more than 100,000 yuan.

Strictly Enforce Trading Price Limit

[Our Report] The rice market reported a price increase in the north market yesterday due to the severe cold weather and the freezing of the Suzhou River, which blocked the source. The south market was relatively stable because the source was still smooth. The authorities strictly enforce the market transaction, and must not exceed the price limit of 1.45 million yuan. Those who violate the regulations will be detained and dealt with.

The weather turned slightly warmer yesterday, and the Suzhou River could thaw. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday that if the ice is still immovable, he will consider formulating countermeasures.

### Raising the US Dollar Exchange Rate

### On the Issue of Overseas Remittances from Siam

— Xu Zuoren

Second: Judging from the estimated figures of total overseas remittances, remittances from Siam also occupy an important position. Although there are no accurate statistics on the total amount of overseas remittances worldwide each year, it is estimated that the total amount of remittances before the war reached 300 million national currency. At the exchange rate at that time, this was equivalent to about US$70 million to US$100 million. After the war, the estimated total amount of overseas remittances remained between US$70 million and US$100 million. It is estimated that remittances from Siam alone reached over US$20 million. If we take US$100 million as the standard for the estimated total amount of remittances, then remittances from Siam alone account for one-quarter of the total. If we take US$70 million as the standard for the estimated total amount of remittances, then remittances from Siam account for more than one-third of the total. Although this number is not very large, it can still provide a helping hand in offsetting the trade deficit. Whether it can be controlled by our country's banks or whether it will be evaded, the outcome can have a significant and completely different impact on our country's economy. Thus, the degree to which remittances from Siam deserve attention can easily be seen.

Third: As mentioned above, whether remittances from Siam can be controlled by our country's banks can have a significant impact on our country's economy, so it is even more important to strive for them. This is because remittances from Siam account for a huge amount, ranging from one-quarter to one-third of the total amount of overseas remittances nationwide. However, the government lacks appropriate policies to attract overseas remittances, especially remittances from Siam. Furthermore, the implementation of the "Economic Suppression" policy has pushed overseas remittances to the brink of danger. On the one hand, the government tightened credit, and on the other hand, it prohibited remittances to and from various regions.

For example, Shantou was originally the central hub for overseas remittances from Siam, but since the implementation of the "Economic Suppression" policy, it has become an "economic isolated island." Before remittances enter the country, one-quarter of them is already cut off. After they enter, they are treated as illegal and are treated the same as other speculative black market activities, increasing the exploitation of overseas remittances and causing them to evade to Hong Kong and flow into the black market. Furthermore, the inflow of overseas remittances into the black market promotes capital flight and trade smuggling, making the national finance more prone to fluctuations.

We only need to see that each financial crisis originates in Hong Kong to understand the deep impact of black market foreign exchange fluctuations on the entire financial economy. Therefore, striving for overseas remittances, especially striving for remittances from Siam, although not a fundamental solution to our country's economic problems, is still an effective way to improve the current economic situation and alleviate financial turbulence.

### Reunited - A Movie Script

— Zhang Daoxiu

(1) Maternity Ward of a Suzhou Obstetrics Hospital · (Early May, Year 26) A simple single room, like the first-class ward of a major hospital, simply, plainly, neatly, and cleanly furnished. (In the room is a packed small suitcase and a cloth bundle. Nailed to the wall is a picture of a baby. The mother, Zheng Jingye, a woman of about twenty-five or six years old, is sitting on a chair, holding an infant not yet a month old, staring blankly, as if there are very difficult things that cannot be solved. Gradually, from the expression on her face, it can be seen that she has made up her mind. She gets up and puts the child on the bed. In a moment, she suddenly turns back with a hesitant expression and runs over to pick up the child. She holds it tightly to her side and kisses it madly. Then she presses her face tightly against the child, standing there blankly, again with a blank expression. Just then, a man of about thirty-five or six years old, He Qi, runs in happily.)

He Qi: Jingye, everything is ready. The newly rented house is furnished, and the wet nurse has been hired... (Before he finishes speaking, he notices Jingye's gloomy daze and is baffled.) ... Hey! What's making you unhappy again?

Jingye: You've prepared everything, and I should be happy. But when I think that our problem can't be solved, I really can't be happy.

He Qi: Haven't I told you repeatedly that I have a way? Don't you believe me?

Jingye: Of course I believe you, but your solutions are limited. Either you find a way to divorce your wife, or you want me to be your mistress forever. I don't agree with either of these solutions.

He Qi: Why not?

Jingye: I've already told you that I don't want to destroy your family, and I don't want to ruin myself from now on. (Emphasizes the words "from now on.")

He Qi: You always think that way, what am I supposed to do?

Jingye: (A little angry.) I don't want you to do anything! (As if talking to herself.) This whole thing is a big mistake. We should painfully correct ourselves and seek our own way out. We can't make another mistake!

He Qi: (Coldly.) It's too late.

Jingye: (Turning to He Qi, firmly.) It's not too late at all!

He Qi: (Anxiously.) What are you planning to do?

Jingye: The best thing would be for us to break up from now on and never see each other again. (With emotion.) Let's consider the past as a dream.

He Qi: (Surprised, distressed, and blaming Jingye for being too stubborn.) Break up from now on, never see each other again! You can leave me heartlessly, but can you heartlessly abandon our lovely daughter?

Jingye: (Extremely angry.) Get out! You just want to use emotions to hold me! (Again, she hugs the child tightly and kisses her madly. Tears flow, and she sobs, gradually becoming resolute again.) No! No! I can't hurt others because I love her. Okay! I'll give you the child. (Hands the child to He Qi, who takes it helplessly.) I've decided to painfully leave you. If you have a conscience, you should find a way to raise her well and educate her to adulthood. You know, even though we have sins, she is innocent.

He Qi: (Pleadingly.) Jingye, you can't do this.

Jingye: I've already decided. It's no use saying more. I'm leaving immediately.

(She picks up her handbag, intending to leave, but He Qi stops her.)

He Qi: Where are you going?

Jingye: I'm going home to see my mother, and then I'll prepare to go abroad.

Nurse: (Knocking on the door and entering.) Mr. He, the car is here to pick you up.

He Qi: Okay, we'll leave right away. Please help me take the suitcase to the car.

Nurse: (Carrying the suitcase in one hand and the bundle in the other, looking around.) Is there anything else?

Jingye: No, there isn't.

Nurse: (Suddenly seeing the picture of the child hanging on the wall, to Jingye.) Don't you want this picture anymore?

Jingye: Yes, I do. (She takes it down herself and puts it in her handbag.)

(The nurse takes the luggage out first, Jingye follows, and He Qi carries the child out, gets into the car, and the car drives out of the hospital.)

(2) The Living Room of He Qi's Shanghai Home (June, Year 26)

One day after lunch, He Qi is in the living room with his wife, Guo Canyun. A servant brings in a letter. He Qi takes it and opens it. In addition to the letter, there is also a picture of a child. After reading the letter:

He Qi: Alas? (Forcing a calm expression.) Such a tragic thing!

Canyun: Who? What happened?

He Qi: (Gives the letter to his wife.) It's a letter from Zhong Yuanchen from Suzhou. Read it.

Canyun: (Takes the letter and reads aloud.) "Brother Qi: My good friend Wu Shiren passed away half a year ago. His wife gave birth to a daughter last month, and unfortunately, Mrs. Wu also died of illness. Now there is an orphan left behind, with no one to care for her. This child has a very beautiful face and looks very intelligent. Because I think that you and your wife do not yet have children, I would like to send her to you for adoption. When she grows up, at least she can keep your wife company. If you decide to take her, please write to me quickly; otherwise, I will have to send her to an orphanage. Sincerely wishing you well." (After Canyun finishes reading the letter.) Oh, how pitiful! (Canyun thinks about this matter.)

He Qi: (Smiling, tentatively asking Canyun.) Yun, would you be willing to adopt this child as a daughter?

Canyun: Me? Who knows what kind of people her parents were?

He Qi: I haven't met this Mr. Wu, but I've often heard Yuanchen praise his character and learning. I heard that Mrs. Wu was also very virtuous. Didn't Yuanchen say once that he wanted to introduce them to us?

Canyun: What do you mean?

He Qi: I don't mind. But if we take her in, it would be a lot of trouble for you.

Canyun: (Looking at He Qi and smiling.) But it would increase your burden. (Pauses slightly.) Write a letter to Yuanchen and ask him to send her to us.

He Qi: (Unexpectedly happy.) Okay, okay! (Runs to the desk to write a letter.)

(3) The He Family Living Room (Late June, Year 26, Before the July 7th Incident)

Canyun: (In the living room. A servant leads Zhong Yuanchen and a wet nurse carrying a child in.) Mr. Zhong, I must have caused you a lot of trouble.

Yuanchen: Not at all, Mrs. He. It's truly wonderful that you are willing to adopt this orphan. (Takes the child from the wet nurse and hands her to Canyun.) I can rest assured giving her to you and your wife. If my unfortunate friends knew, they would surely thank you as well. Hey! Where is Brother Qi?

Canyun: He'll be here soon. (Holds the child and looks at her carefully, clearly very satisfied.)

Yuanchen: She doesn't have a name yet. Give her one.

He Qi: (Smiling at his wife.) You'll have something to do from now on.

Canyun: (Also smiling.) You won't be able to shirk responsibility from now on!

He Qi: Why don't you give her a name?

Canyun: I was thinking, how about calling her "Xiuzhen"?

He Qi Yuanchen: (Great! Everyone is delighted.)

(4) The Pier (Early August, Year 26)

A pier in Yangshupu, Shanghai. A large ocean liner is docked at the pier. Many passengers on the ship are looking at the many people seeing them off on the pier from inside the ship's cabin. The ship's horn sounds, and the ship starts to move. Jingye is on board this ship, heading to America. She is waving goodbye to the relatives and friends who are seeing her off. Among the relatives and friends are many men, women, and children, including her sister-in-law, Mrs. Zheng.

(5) The Ship Jingye is on (Mid-August, Year 26. Before the ship reaches America, news of the August 13th Incident arrives).

The ship sails on the sea, the seawater rolls, and the waves surge.

(6) The Ship's Lounge

There are many Chinese passengers in the lounge, some reading, some reading newspapers, some playing cards. Zheng Jingye is sitting blankly on the sofa.

The radio is playing Western music. A young man switches the radio to a Chinese broadcast.

Everyone listens carefully to the radio broadcast of Chinese news reports.

Broadcaster: Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station XG.O.A. Now broadcasting Central News Agency news. First, Zhengzhou, 10th: All armed and on alert. The situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious, and war is imminent. The broadcast attracts Jingye's attention. Worried, she imagines her baby, smiles, and then becomes very uneasy. She stands up to look at the sea outside the window.

He Qi: (Running in frantically.) Yuanchen, did you bring her?

Yuanchen: (Points to the child that Canyun is holding.) Isn't she here? (He Qi runs over to the child. Yuanchen also comes closer, looking at He Qi and smiling knowingly.) Look how cute this child is. If I didn't have too many children, I wouldn't give her to you.

He Qi: Oh, she's so cute!

Canyun: What's her name? (Picture on the cover of the "Reunited" movie script) Our army and the Japanese army are fighting fiercely in the suburbs of Tianjin. Our army's morale is very high.

Second, Shanghai, 10th: Regarding the Hongqiao Airport incident, the Japanese military's attitude is tough, and our side has made proper preparations. Due to heavy traffic, passenger trains between Nanjing and Shanghai have already been suspended. No less than tens of thousands of Shanghai residents have moved from Zhabei into the concessions, and the roads are extremely crowded. A state of emergency has now been entered. There are iron mesh fortifications at the entrances to the concessions. Inspectors from the Public Works Department and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps

(7) Shanghai Road

The streets of Shanghai are crowded with thousands upon thousands of pedestrians, walking in a crowded mess. At this time, an old man says to a middle-aged man with emotion.

Old Man: Sigh! A few years ago, there was a similar exodus during the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. This is the second time.

Young Man: This is truly a sea of people!

Old Man: This time is different from last time. China has officially started fighting the Japanese devils in the north.

Shanghai will inevitably have to fight as well. This is the people's will, and no one can stop it.

(Everyone walks crowded together. There are fortifications on the streets of the concessions, and security is tight.)

(Notices recruiting soldiers pasted on telephone poles are torn off.)

(8) Zhabei Battlefield (Late at Night)

Cannons and gunfire fill the sky as the enemy and we fight fiercely. Countless searchlights shine in the sky.

Enemy planes drop bombs from the sky. Thick smoke and fierce fires rise.

### The Theme of National Art

— Jin Shan

The primary goal of the current art movement is to develop the creative spirit of the nation and establish a new national art.

Primitive art was mostly a depiction of daily life, inseparable from the reality of life. The ancient Chinese paintings that can be seen now, such as the Han Dynasty stone carvings, such as the Xiaoshan Hall stone carvings, carved in the fourth year of Yongda during the reign of Emperor Shun of the Han Dynasty, depict processions of chariots and horses, wars, presentation of captives, the Duke of Zhou assisting King Cheng, and Guo Ju burying his son. Such as the Wu Family Shrine stone carvings, carved during the reign of Emperor Huan of the Han Dynasty, depict the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, filial sons, martyrs, wars, widowhood, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius meeting Laozi. In addition, there are also the Li Gang stone room, the Dong Hui stone gate, and so on. The content of the inscriptions is mostly based on stories of figures.

Similarly, general religious paintings are also mostly based on stories of figures. The introduction of Buddhist art further strengthened the development of figure painting in our country.

Wu Cao Buxing, Jin Gu Kaizhi, and Tang Wu Daozi were all masters of figure painting, becoming masters of their generations. "Shi Shuo Xin Yu" records Gu Kaizhi's story: "When he wrote for Gu Zhongkan, Yin had an eye disease and firmly declined. Kaizhi said: 'Your Excellency is limited for this reason. If the bright and sharp pupils are brushed with flying white, making them like light clouds obscuring the moon, wouldn't that be beautiful!'" It can be seen that the painting at that time focused on the spirit of realism.

However, Cao Buxing's "Sitting by the Clear Stream Picture" and Xian Kaizhi's "Respect for the Five Peaks Picture" both used landscapes as backgrounds, thus opening up a new path for landscape painting, which developed through the Northern and Southern Dynasties. From the Song and Yuan Dynasties to the present, it has always become the mainstream of Chinese painting.

Exploring the reasons for the development of landscape painting in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, it is nothing more than the impact of frequent wars at that time. Scholar-officials avoided the world and were tired of the world, and the idea of seclusion gradually became a trend. They inherited Lao-Zhuang philosophy, revived the Wei-Jin Qingtan legacy, and inclined to nature. Artists were influenced by literati and elegant scholars, and transformed from art for the sake of life to art for the sake of art. In terms of the development of painting techniques, it was an inevitable trend. Thus, it gradually changed from thoughtful story books to theme-less landscape paintings.

However, the alertness of the times tells us that we can no longer indulge in world-weary thoughts and self-intoxication for the sake of art. Under the premise of inheriting the traditions of national art and absorbing the essence of world art, the creation of new national art seems to start from restoring the theme of painting, and future art creation cannot be separated from the form of the nation, the content of the times, and especially the following themes should be the principle—

First, commend typical figures who exemplify the nation's integrity, such as revolutionary martyrs in the War of Resistance.

Second, publicize representative stories of national morality, such as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, peace.

Third, expose the evil deeds of national enemies, such as traitors, bandits, wealthy families, and corrupt officials.

Fourth, symbolize the newborn power of the nation's life, such as spring breeze, timely rain, and vigorous vitality.

Shanghai has always been the cultural center of the country, and the national art world only follows the lead of the Shanghai art world. Now, at the time of the annual meeting of the Shanghai Art Association, I would like to briefly state my humble opinions as a celebration. I not only hope that the Chinese painting style will change from this, but also hope that the new national art will be produced, which will also begin today.

It is reported that the Shanghai Art Association held its annual meeting today. This publication originally planned to compile and publish a special issue, but due to limited space, it specially introduces one commemorative essay, one sculpture, and briefly expresses its feelings on the theme of art works, in order to extend the sincerity of the celebration.

### Eliminate Imitation of the Ancients

— Liu Shi

—Written for the Annual Meeting of the Shanghai Art Association—

On this day of the Shanghai Art Association's "Annual Meeting," I would like to put forward two more specific opinions in the spirit of throwing a brick to attract jade, hoping that the older generation and young friends will give their advice. Or it can be used as a topic for everyone to discuss. If a satisfactory conclusion can be reached, it will not only be a blessing for me personally, but also a blessing for the Chinese art movement.

What exactly is art? In the current chaotic world, there are complex interpretations - capitalists and socialists have different interpretations of it, conservatives and innovators also have different interpretations. Thus, some call it "supreme," some call it "utilitarian," some slander it as "decoration," and some even use it as "propaganda."

In between, there are two issues: one is content, and the other is technique.

Regardless of Chinese and Western art, looking at history, the content and techniques of art produced in a certain era and in a certain society have extremely obvious characteristics; especially in the past hundreds of years, the European art world (Renaissance to the 20th century) has been more clearly divided. For example, the art of the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties in our country, to outsiders, may not be able to find their characteristics, but friends engaged in this field will never deny that they have epoch-making faces. Unfortunately, since the Republic of China, except for a very small number of outstanding writers, they have blindly advocated imitation, and the trend of inheritance has been prevalent. This is true of Chinese painting, and it is also true of so-called "Western painting." Those who wander on the ancient tomb path not only have no self-awareness, but also cold-shoulder and scold special talents who produce special works (those with special content and techniques), and even point them out as rebels... In this way, talking about life is the life of the ancients, talking about society is the society of the ancients, talking about the times is the times of the ancients, writing poetry requires the style of Li and Du, writing requires inscriptions on oracle bones, and painting requires the style of the Four Wangs and even the Song and Yuan dynasties to be qualified. They have completely forgotten that they have cut their braids and are sitting in a Western-style house under electric lights.

A few days ago, Brother Yi Junzuo also raised this issue at a gathering. Although he is not a painter, and although some "painters" refuted his opinion, I strongly agree with it. Tang people painted Tang clothing and architecture, and Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing people could paint Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing clothing and architecture. Why can't people of the Republic of China paint the clothing and architecture of the Republic of China? Some people say that modern clothing and architecture are not elegant and not noble, so how can palace costumes and palaces be painted? Noble? I think this is prejudice, the prejudice of feudalists. If you say that neither modern clothes and modern architecture nor palace costumes and palaces are noble, and only Taoist robes and thatched huts can be painted, then why don't the authors themselves be thoroughly elegant in their words and deeds? Isn't this the same hypocrisy as writing articles about the proletariat while living in high-rise buildings? Moreover, there is a word "truth" in the elements of art.

Furthermore, the so-called "spirit of the times" needs to have obvious characteristics in "technique." In addition to clothing and architecture being special markers, it is often impossible to find it in the subject matter. For example, if a Song person paints a fish, the fish is an unchanging clothing for thousands of years, but if you want to distinguish the dynasty of that fish, it is more reliable to focus on studying its technique than to rely solely on examining the author's surname and year, because technique is the expression of human wisdom. The ancients were smart, and modern people are even smarter. Things that did not exist in ancient times have been invented in modern times. This is an undeniable progress of human wisdom. This proves that "imitation of the ancients" is a "policy of regression." The existence of imitation of the ancients is an obstacle to the era of progress. In order to demand the expansion of the Chinese art movement and reach the point of rejuvenation, it is necessary to strengthen the force of innovation and unite as one to give the imitators of the ancients a merciless blow, so that they will submit and gradually be eliminated. In this way, Chinese art will have a bright future and will be able to stand side by side with world art, as I say.

### The Emergence of a New National Art

— Yu Jianhua

— Written for the Annual Meeting of the Boha Art Association —

Because the Chinese nation possesses a unique power of absorption and assimilation, the scope of the Chinese nation expands daily, its territory becomes increasingly vast, and the national character of the Chinese people grows ever stronger. From the Three Dynasties to the present, spanning four to five thousand years, it can be said that the nation has transformed from a minority to a majority on one hand, and from a majority to a minority on the other. The transformation from minority to majority signifies the extent of absorption, while the transformation from majority to minority indicates the effectiveness of assimilation. This phenomenon is also evident in academics. For example, Buddhist thought, upon arriving in China, was enthusiastically absorbed by Chinese scholars. Not long after absorption, a process of assimilation began; not only did the teachings of Zen Buddhism become popular for a time, but the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties also forged an inextricable link with Zen. As a result, Buddhism remained Buddhism, but it transformed into Chinese Buddhism, rather than Indian Buddhism.

Absorption and assimilation are particularly prominent in Chinese art. Again, taking Buddhism as an example, after Buddhist images were introduced, from Cao Buxing in the Three Kingdoms period to the eminent masters of the Six Dynasties—Xian Jingzhi, Zhang Sengyao, and Lu Tanwei—and even to the sage of calligraphy in the Tang Dynasty, Wu Daozi, all were experts in painting Buddhist images. Initially, there was unconditional absorption. After prolonged absorption, changes gradually occurred in form, color, and brushwork. Buddhist images transformed from objects of worship into art for appreciation. By the time of Li Longmian, he had completely broken away from Indian techniques, abandoning the resplendent colors of India and adopting the method of plain line drawing. Sculpture followed a similar path. The tens of thousands of statues in the Longmen and Yungang Grottoes still retain their great value in the history of sculpture, with their solemn beauty drawing from India, yet imbued with a unique Chinese style. As for architecture, the construction of temples, especially pagodas, was all learned from India. Who now knows that these are not original Chinese creations?

In music, it is likely that the original Chinese instruments were only the qin, se, sheng, zhong, and drum. Other instruments, such as the flute, nao, pipa, huqin, and jiegu, were foreign imports. In the Tang Dynasty, ancient imperial music was called "yayue," the new sounds of previous generations were called "qingyue," and music harmonized with foreign departments was called "yanle," also known as "yanle." At that time, yayue had already declined, and qingyue was not well-received. The most popular was the foreign yanle. In the sixteenth year of the Zhenguan era, a banquet was held for the court officials, and ten parts of music were performed, which were obtained from Gaochang. There were eight pieces for the standing orchestra: Anle, Taipingle, Pozhenle, Qingshanle, Dadingle, Shangyuanle, Shengshoule, and Guangshengle. There were six pieces for the sitting orchestra: Yanle, Changshoule, Tianshoule, Niaochui Wansui Le, Longchile, and Xiaopozhenle. Du You said, "From Anle onwards, all use large drums, mixed with Kucha melodies, the sound reverberating for miles, all played standing. Only the Qingshan melody uses solely the music of Liangzhou, which is the most leisurely and elegant." He also said, "From Changshou onwards, all use Kucha melodies, only the Longchi melody uses yayue flute sounds." From this, it can be seen that Tang Dynasty music was almost entirely absorbed from Western Region music, which is the same kind of music performed in Xinjiang's current singing and dancing. Unfortunately, the Western Regions in China have disappeared without a trace after more than a thousand years, so when we now see Xinjiang's singing and dancing, we are surprised by its novelty. In reality, Chinese and Xinjiang music had already been unified a thousand years ago.

Chinese art, in addition to being influenced and transformed by Buddhism and the Western Regions, underwent a second major transformation upon contact with Western culture, which also initiated a second large-scale absorption. Undoubtedly, a process of assimilation is also taking place imperceptibly. The first time was due to the introduction of religion, and the second time was also due to religion. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, European missionaries, such as Matteo Ricci, brought to China not only evangelism but also knowledge of painting, geometry, and astronomy. By the Qing Dynasty, astronomy was highly valued by the court, and in the field of painting, the arrival of Giuseppe Castiglione caused a stir. However, at that time, the influence of foreign painting was not significant, so assimilation soon took place. Even Castiglione himself advocated a combination of Chinese and Western styles. The large-scale import of Western culture has been happening since the Boxer Rebellion, in recent decades, and has brought about significant changes in art. First, in architecture, initially, there were purely Western-style high-rise buildings, representing the era of absorption. Later, there were hybrid styles, with Chinese exteriors and Western interiors, such as Peking Union Medical College, the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing, and the Shanghai YMCA in the city center. These are all typical examples. What kind of style will be assimilated in the future is not yet predictable, but it is undeniable that a style that is neither fully Chinese nor fully Western will emerge in the future. In music, Western instruments have been completely imported. Most songs use the staff notation, using "do re mi..." instead of "gong che shang si he" and "gong shang jiao zhi yu." Although China still has its inherent music, it is already like the yayue of the Tang Dynasty, with few people understanding it and even fewer people liking it. However, pure Western songs and pure Western orchestral music have not been accepted by the general public either. Only a few experts are making efforts, and the general public only likes to use Western notation for Chinese songs. From the perspective of those who advocate full Westernization, this is certainly not thorough, but this is a characteristic of the Chinese nation. The reason why the Chinese nation has been able to endure for so long lies in this point. In sculpture, the current sculptors have all studied in Europe. Not only are the statues they sculptured Chinese people, but their grandeur, simplicity, and abundance are also entirely Chinese. With the techniques of Western realism and the poetic ideals of China, their works are naturally different from those of Westerners.

As for painting, what was introduced at the end of the Qing Dynasty has already been digested invisibly. In modern times, a large amount has been imported. School drawing classes are all Western painting, and art school students are more often in the Western painting departments than in the Chinese painting departments. Many people go abroad to study painting. Some Chinese painters have also utilized Western painting methods in exploring the improvement of Chinese painting. However, on the one hand, because the power of traditional Chinese painting is deeply rooted, it is not easily shaken by external forces. On the other hand, it has been inspired and motivated by external stimuli. Therefore, twenty years ago, the influence of Chinese painting was not very strong, but recently it has rebounded and rejuvenated. At the same time, those who specialize in Western painting have also gradually started painting Chinese paintings. This may also be the assimilation that must occur after a large amount of absorption?

Looking at modern Chinese art, there is no kind that is not absorbing a large number of new foreign elements. We earnestly hope that in the near future, we will be able to assimilate these new foreign elements and produce a new Chinese art full of new blood and new life!

### Fried Dough Sticks and Water

— He Ku

I am a regular customer at the fried dough stick stall near Nongkou. I buy fried dough sticks from there and eat them with porridge for a simple breakfast snack. After eating fried dough sticks for several months, I noticed that the length of the fried dough sticks changed from time to time, shrinking from fourteen inches to eight inches, and then stretching from eight inches to twelve inches. Every time the price increased, the fried dough sticks would definitely be lengthened to the standard length set by the stall owner. As prices gradually increased later, the length of the fried dough sticks gradually shrank. From the cyclical nature of the length of the fried dough sticks, one can see the changes in the social economy, but this is not what I want to talk about in this article, so I will not dwell on it.

The fried dough stick stall owner is indeed a person who values fair trade. Judging from the length of the fried dough sticks, the longest was fourteen inches and the shortest was eight inches. That is to say, an eleven-inch-long fried dough stick represents the size during a period of economic stability. Every time the price increased, he had to lengthen the fried dough stick a little to show that even though the price had increased, it was still a good deal for you. The fried dough sticks were a little longer than before. In the future, if the length shrank below eleven inches, it was probably because the price of oil had increased, the price of flour had changed, and his standard length could only be gradually reduced. I say that the fried dough stick stall owner values commercial ethics because only they take into account public opinion when raising prices, so they especially lengthen the fried dough sticks to show that although I have raised the price, the goods have also been widened in size. At least you can get a larger fried dough stick than yesterday for the higher price you pay. The seller has commercial ethics, and the buyer gets a fair trade.

It seems a bit pedantic to talk about commercial ethics at this time, but the fried dough stick stall is a place where "etiquette is lost and sought in the wilderness."

Recently, the drinks that are closely related to us have encountered salty flavors countless times in the past month! The Public Works Bureau has allowed the six major public utilities to automatically adjust their fees, but what we get is salty drinks! I think that except for stingy restaurant owners who might welcome it to save a few grains of salt in a plate of vegetable soup, most people would not think of salt as a precious thing in their daily drinking water, and even feel that salty tap water is our tap water company's year-end giveaway, right? Even though the company declares that this does not affect hygiene, they do not consider commercial ethics, treating all users as severely "taste-blind" patients, so there is no need to even apologize (let's just say that the salty taste is due to the weak skills of the company's managers, which is beyond salvation), then how can we not feel that the fried dough stick stall owner's ancient ways are commendable?

### The Ancients Valued Substance

— Baili

The ancients valued substance, and writing sought truth. Matters that the world today would be ashamed to speak of and would necessarily conceal were often seen in the epitaphs of the ancients. Leng Lu Zashi quotes: Epitaphs of women who remarried were seen in Song Zijing's epitaph for Zhang Jing's wife, Tang, and Chen Liaoqi's epitaph for Empress Dowager Huang. Daughters who remarried were seen in Chen Liaoqi's epitaph for Lady Gao, the magistrate of Renshou County. Liu Nan Suibi says: Remarriage of women is a loss of virtue, but Ye Shuixin's epitaph for Weng Cheng reads: His daughter married Feng Yu, the Wenlin official and magistrate of Fenshui County, Yanzhou. After Yu died, she remarried Jinshi He, etc. Fan Wenzheng, a famous minister of a generation, directly wrote in his chronology that his mother, Xie, remarried Zhu of Changshan, etc. From all this, it can be seen that the ancients were also extremely free in marriage. By the first year of Yongzheng, an edict was issued to each province, prefecture, and county to build ancestral halls for chastity and filial piety, and officials would offer sacrifices in spring and autumn. Although the name was to promote chastity, in fact, women were bound by this and fell into the abyss. As for Lu Fangweng's Lao Xue An Notes, it says: Minister Yan Jingchu, wrote an epitaph for a scholar-official and showed it to Zhu Xizhen. Xizhen said, "It is very good, but it seems to be missing four characters, but I dare not tell you." Jingchu pressed him to ask. Xizhen carefully pointed to a place under "Collected Works, Ding Volume" and said, "This place is missing." He asked again, "What characters are missing?" He said, "It should be added 'not circulating in the world' four characters." Jingchu then added three characters "hidden at home," which was actually Xizhen's intention. I say that Xizhen's saying "the collected works of ten volumes do not circulate in the world" means that having a collected works is no different from not having it. Since Jingchu said that he had collected works, he should add this sentence to preserve its truth. His name is not unworthy of being called "Xizhen." Jingchu changed it to the three characters "hidden at home." "Hidden at home" and "not circulating in the world" have the same meaning, but looking at the wording, it is full of connotations. Jingchu was willing to accept straightforward words, and he was still a gentleman. All of them valued the truth in writing. For example, a rich man in Chengdu asked Yang Ziyun to write a humorous inscription for a legal official for a hundred gold, but Ziyun refused. Han Nizhou built the Southern Garden and asked Yang Wanli to write a record for it, but Wanli would rather abandon his official position than write the record. Their character is especially worthy of praise.

### The Life of Zhuge Liang

— Lu Shi

Because of the excessive sensationalism of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Mr. Kongming is portrayed as a god-like sorcerer who borrows wind and shrinks the earth, using the Eight Trigrams and Yin Yang. No wonder Sima Yi, in the Empty City Stratagem, had to scold him as a "sorcerer."

In fact, Kongming's career was not particularly outstanding. At best, he was just a staff member under Liu Bei's separatist regime. When he took charge of the military and national affairs and made six expeditions to Qishan, he did not gain an inch of land in the Central Plains and can only be considered a failed hero.

His lasting fame and long-standing reputation are generally acknowledged to be due to the two sentences in the Later Letter to the Emperor: "I will devote myself to the task until my dying day." These two sentences are indeed the model for a person to do business. The spirit of Kongming is worthy of worship, and it lies in this.

But now, the view of Kongming should focus on his will before his death: "My personal clothing and food are provided by the government. Chengdu has five hundred mulberry trees and fifteen qing of thin fields. My descendants have more than enough clothing and food. After my death, do not allow there to be surplus silk inside or surplus wealth outside." Given his position as prime minister of the Shu Han Dynasty, with authority higher than today's premier, and that he had worked for the government all his life without managing production, the estate he left behind (according to Kongming's title as Marquis of Wuxiang, he was entitled to stipends, and the mulberry orchards and fields in Chengdu were his official emoluments) was so meager, and he still repeatedly instructed that his descendants should not have any surplus. Such integrity and loyalty are sufficient to be a model for future generations.

### The Problem of "Face"

— Yi Feng

The Jianghai Customs embezzlement case, which caused a sensation in Shanghai, was publicly tried in the capital a few days ago. The confession of the main culprit, Yin Lanzun, was quite "naive." He said that he had damaged Yue Xinmin's face and had stated "this will not be repeated." Such a big problem seemed to be due to "human feelings" and "face." As for the true situation, outsiders do not know. I have never met Yin, so I have absolutely no motive or obligation to defend him. However, to be honest, in our current society, the unbreakable circle of "human feelings" and "face" has indeed harmed many people and ruined many things! Although the call for the rule of law has been loud in the past one or two decades, in reality, from the court to the countryside, from top to bottom, who is not tightly encircled by the deeply rooted circle of "human feelings," just like the golden hoop on Sun Wukong's head, it is easy to ask to get rid of it!

"Human feelings" and "face" seem to be different on the surface, but in reality, they are two sides of the same thing. Therefore, the so-called "human feelings" is also the "problem of face." It just so happens that our national character seems to have an innate bias that face is higher than everything else. Therefore, "human feelings" are often connected with "national law" and "heavenly principles," and are even more important than these two. As a result, many problems that are absolutely difficult to reconcile in law or that cannot be solved for years can be resolved over a cup of wine at a banquet, or easily dispersed in the "enthusiasm" of "giving gifts." Therefore, "face" forms the basis of "human feelings," and those who "protect themselves wisely" and emphasize the "doctrine of the mean" must take into account "human feelings," "national law," and "heavenly principles" to feel at ease; otherwise, tearing "face" and not giving "human feelings" is either a "fool" or an "idiot," which is such an embarrassing and disappointing thing!

It is said that the most difficult official to be is the "censor" who holds a position in the language of the court. Why? Because the Yamen is responsible for supervising the court's policies, from the emperor to the important officials and hundreds of officials; if they see a malpractice and do not speak out, people with conscience will inevitably feel the shame of "holding a position without doing anything." If they speak frankly and do not leave "face," then the "disaster" caused by exposing the wound, the big one will move their head, the small one will be beaten on the ass, and then they will roll up their bedding and get out of here. Even Emperor Li Shimin, who was called a wise monarch of a generation by historians, would be so angry with Wei Zheng's unreasonable remonstrances that he almost staged the tragedy of "must kill this peasant," and opened a knife with his "mirror"! It can be seen that not understanding human feelings and not giving face is so dangerous. No wonder later clever people have developed a style of only slapping flies and not hitting tigers that is similar to "human feelings," and the world has also left two experienced words: "Human feelings are like debts, selling the pot on your head."

Because, selling the pot is just not eating, but the result of not giving "face" will make you suffer the blow of "this road is not open" everywhere, which is harmful enough! Moreover, the role of "human feelings" is also mutually beneficial. There is a harvest for every effort. Getting money from others also means helping them to eliminate disasters. For example, Yin Lanzun signed the inspection sheet, and 150,000 US dollars were voluntarily sent to his door. It's just that he had bad financial luck, and as a result, he was taken to the official residence and asked the judge for forgiveness, but he couldn't get forgiveness. However, there are still many large and small Yin Lanzuns who are at large and living leisurely!

Finally, to say something unpleasant, if this kind of "human feelings" and "face" is not eradicated one day, when will China be able to embark on the road to the rule of law? Only God knows!

### Gospel of Navigation

— Tuo

There is a chemical that, when dropped into ice, can create a bright sheen, safeguarding many seafarers and cross-sea aviators. The formula for this chemical has been invented by three prominent chemists.

In addition to emitting a flash on the water's surface that allows nighttime aircraft to land on the sea, this chemical can be used by ships or aircraft as an indicator during voyages, indicating the position of lifeboats, and guiding search ships to find aircraft that have landed in the dark.

The luminescent chemical is synthesized from four chemicals. The four ingredients are ground into a fine powder, mixed, and then pressed into small tablets using a press. When this tablet is dropped into water, it produces a chemical luminescent reaction.

Horticulturists say that picking roses daily is best done as late as possible. Roses picked as late as 4:30 p.m. last ten hours longer than those picked in the morning with dew. This experiment has been tried on a thousand roses in the Cornell Gardens, and it has been consistently successful.

### Reputation

— Compiled by Zhi Min

Without reputation, there is no life. (Shakespeare)

I do not seek the reputation of a day, but the reputation of eternity. (Pomponazzi)

A person of reputation is worse than dead. (Guizot)

Reputation is property. It is better to be poor and praised than to be rich and disgraced. (Theodore)

Reputation is better than beauty. Life can be taken away, but reputation cannot be taken away. People in the world do not value morality if they do not value reputation. Reputation is like a river, but its source is small, but where it reaches, it must be very large. (English proverb)

A good name is better than a golden belt. (French proverb)

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (55)

Old Mrs. Zhang was in the next room. Hearing Yunqing crying, she rushed in and asked, "Yunqing, what's the matter? Are you angry again? You're not children anymore, how can you get angry when three sentences don't agree?" As she spoke, she patted her on the shoulder and said, "Today I saw the two of you eating at the same table, and I was very happy. Don't be angry." Yunqing said, "Mother! Don't dream. It's not what we want." The old ladies were surprised and asked, "What? Didn't he already divorce Fengsheng? He's been paying attention to you since he was a child. What's the problem now! It's just that his old man hasn't passed this hurdle. Old people all love their children, and besides, we're relatives, so we'll definitely succeed in the end." Yunqing said, "Mother! You don't know. It's not like that at all. I was used by him. I'm infatuated with a female actress! Huangsheng ruined me. How can I be worthy of her?" Old Mrs. Zhang was shocked and said, "What, a female actress? How do you know? Did he tell you?" Yunqing handed a stack of photos to Old Mrs. Zhang and said, "Mother—take a look and you'll know." Old Mrs. Zhang looked at the stack of photos under the electric light and said, "This female actress is quite pretty. What's her name?" Yunqing said, "It's the famous Gu Qitong." Old Mrs. Zhang said, "Don't be impatient. This matter must be investigated carefully. Don't break up with him all of a sudden. Maybe they just took a photo out of momentary joy. That doesn't mean anything." Yunqing said, "It's definitely not accidental. I've long suspected that he's been paying attention to this actress." Old Mrs. Zhang said, "Even if he loves this actress, he can't marry her. His father is so stubborn. Does he have the guts to do that? Don't worry!" Yunqing said, "When people are infatuated, they can do anything." Old Mrs. Zhang said, "This matter still needs to be investigated. Don't be impatient. Deal with it slowly. I think you can't escape from our grasp." Yunqing said, "This matter can't be forced. Only if one party is forced, then it's not true love." Old Mrs. Zhang laughed and said, "These are all the words of inexperienced children. Now they talk about free marriage and love. When I got married, no one knew anyone very well. When we got married, we had very good feelings for each other. What love or not, just ask if you can understand each other. It's not easy to be a person. Since you like Zhuzhai, and Zhuzhai likes you too, and you both want to, what's true or false love. Love is made by each other, not just love at first sight. Don't worry, and don't be angry. I'll ask him in person tomorrow, and I'll know. You go to sleep." Saying that, she patted Yunqing's shoulders lightly. Yunqing saw that her mother had said this set of motherly words, and knew that if she argued with her again, she would not listen, so she said, "I won't be angry. Mother, don't ask him tomorrow. I have a way."

### A Discourse on the Ancient Ghost City of Fengdu

— Tu Feng

E-du is considered the abode of the netherworld, but when this legend began is known by few.

According to historical records, E-du was anciently called Feng, and belonged to Liangzhou. During the Zhou Dynasty, it was a separate capital of the Ba people. In the Qin Dynasty, it belonged to Ba Commandery. During the Han Dynasty, it was established as Zhi County, still belonging to Ba. In the second year of the Yongyuan era of Emperor He of the Han Dynasty, Pingdu County was established by splitting Zhi County. In the first year of the Chuping era of Emperor Xian, Ba was divided into two, and Pingdu belonged to Yongning Commandery, which stretched from Jiangzhou to Linjiang. During the Yanxi era of the Shu Han, Pingdu was merged into Linjiang County. During the Jin, Song, and Qi dynasties, it belonged to Ba Commandery. During the Liang Dynasty, it was Linjiang County Commandery. During the Later Zhou, it was Lin Prefecture. During the Sui, it was Linjiang County, belonging to Ba Commandery. Later, it was changed back to Lin Prefecture, and Fengdu County was established by splitting Lin Prefecture. Only at this point did the characters for Fengdu come into being. It was not until the establishment of the county in the fourteenth year of the Hongwu era of the Ming Dynasty that Feng was changed to Deng. At this point, the two characters for Dengdu were exactly the same as the Dengdu of Hell. However, when the misunderstanding began is unknown. It was probably after the Han Dynasty, because it is closely related to the "Yin King."

According to the Biographies of Immortals, "During the Later Han Dynasty, there was Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, from Donghai. He was recommended as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate and was knowledgeable in astronomy, prognostication, and divination. During the reign of Emperor Huan, he wrote more than four hundred characters on the palace gate regarding calamities and omens, and ordered people to scrape them off, but the ink seeped into the wood. Later, he abandoned his official position and went into seclusion. In the early years of the Qinglong era of the Wei Dynasty, he ascended to heaven on Pingdu Mountain. It is also said that he was a man of the Former Han Dynasty who, after abandoning his official position, hid in the home of Grand Commandant Chen Tan. After his corpse disintegration, he retreated to Pingdu Mountain. In the early years of the Qinglong era of the Wei Dynasty, he attained enlightenment, steamed dozens of cauldrons of yellow earth, and sprinkled them with cinnabar medicine, turning them all into gold. Five-colored clouds split the earth and emerged, carrying him away to immortality."

At that time, Yin Changsheng also became immortal on Pingdu Mountain. Yin was "a native of Xinye, who disliked glory and wealth. He obtained the method of transcending the world from Ma Mingsheng and went to Qingcheng Mountain together. After completing the elixir, he wrote nine chapters and ascended to heaven in broad daylight on Pingdu Mountain in the YanGuang era."

Due to the connection of these two people with Pingdu Mountain, the misunderstanding probably started here. Later, Lü Chunyang attained enlightenment from Zhongli Quan and came to Pingdu Mountain to visit the two immortals Wang and Yin, leaving behind two poems about not meeting them: "Passing Pingdu on a clear morning of the Ghost Festival, no famous mountain in the world can compare. Two mouths, a single line, people do not recognize, Wang and Yin in vain make the horse's hooves empty." "A white crane cries and leaves Qingcheng, visiting the two friends Wang and Yin again. Mouths only think of the elixir of the Three Islands, raising my eyes, I have already passed Dongting Spring." These two poems had a great impact on later generations, especially those who were superstitious about ghosts and gods, who would most likely misunderstand. They probably read Wang and Yin together, and even reversed them, thus creating the theory of hell, determining it as the abode of the netherworld, and quoting Li Bai's poem "Laughing below at the scholars of the world, sinking their souls in the northern Dengdu" as proof. However, Li Bai's poem probably refers to something else, not the Dengdu of Shu.

The famous mountain is Pingdu Mountain, probably named from the phrase "The First Capital of Famous Mountains in the World." At the top of the mountain is Xiandu Temple, commonly known as the Temple of the Son of Heaven. During the Tang Dynasty, it was called Xiandu, during the Song Dynasty, Jingde, and also Baihe Temple. According to folklore, Yin Changsheng and Wang Fangping refined their forms here. Behind the Temple of the Son of Heaven is Lingxu Pavilion, with statues of the Yin King playing chess, also known as Erta Pavilion, which is said to be an earlier building.

In front of the main hall of the Temple of the Son of Heaven, there is a bronze mirror called the Karma Mirror, which is more than ten feet in diameter. Wang Tingxian's Autumn Mountain Gleanings records: "Over time, it became dim, but even cunning and evil people who pass by here still dare not look directly at it." This further increases the mystery of the Temple of the Son of Heaven.

The owner of the Temple of the Son of Heaven, due to the misinterpretation of the Yin King, believes that he is Yin Changsheng, which is a very ridiculous thing. Fan Chengda's Lake Boat Records says: "Three miles from the county is Pingdu Mountain. According to the inscriptions, Wang Fangping of the Former Han Dynasty and Yin Changsheng of the Later Han Dynasty both attained enlightenment here and became immortals. There is Yin Jun's elixir furnace. This Yin Jun of Dengdu is Yin Changsheng. Popular misconception has made him the master of the underworld, thus considering Youdu the residence of the Ghost Earl, which is extremely wrong."

The second owner of the Temple of the Son of Heaven is the Heavenly Queen, and the legend is like this: There was a woman in Chongqing who became a widow at a young age and served her parents-in-law for ten years as if it were one day, eating vegetarian food and chanting scriptures. One day, she told her family to go to a famous mountain to attain enlightenment, and then her breath stopped. Therefore, the people of Chongqing took it as an honor and made a big show of it, sending her off with drums and cannons. It is said that the corpse was loaded onto a wooden boat and brought here. In the Temple of the Son of Heaven, she received a share of incense offerings. Even now, every year on the second day of the second lunar month, the women of Chongqing are still the most energetic pilgrims.

It is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. How can ghosts and gods be an exception? It is said that the Heavenly Queen's substitute is a native of Dianjiang, naturally also a widow with a background in loyalty and filial piety. The people of Dianjiang also came to send her off with great fanfare. But why the King of the Underworld only likes widows is something that we mortals do not know.

### Hairdressing in Moscow

— Ruan Shi

Gihasen is a correspondent stationed in the Soviet Union for an American newspaper. When he first had a haircut in Moscow, he was very unaccustomed, but he says he is now used to it. He wrote a special feature communication about his first haircut experience, the content of which is roughly as follows:

One clear morning, he walked into the most famous barbershop in Moscow to get a haircut. The barbershop had only four rooms: a waiting room, which was sparsely decorated with only a few long benches for customers to sit on; a men's barbershop; a women's barbershop; and a nail salon.

When he walked into the waiting room, he found the benches full of people waiting for haircuts, men, women, old, and young. There were only two staff members in the waiting room, a receptionist and an accountant. Because it would take a long time for his turn, he talked to the receptionist about the Soviet hairdressing industry. From the receptionist's words, he learned that Soviet barbershops can be divided into two types: one is completely opened by the Hairdressing Trust Cooperative, and the other is opened with a portion of investment from the cooperative. Barbers' salaries are determined by the amount of work they do. In the Soviet Union, there are more female barbers than male barbers. The sign of the barbershop still uses a word with many letters, Parikmakherskaaya, which was introduced by the Germans during the Tsarist era. Its meaning is "wig installer." Ordinary people not only do not know how to explain this word, they simply cannot even pronounce it!

With great difficulty, he waited for more than an hour before it was his turn. He was led into the men's barbershop. The barber was not only unskilled, but also very rude. His haircut can be said to be not "cutting," but "plucking," so it was extremely painful. Hairs "settled" in the neck, and the barber did not use a brush to remove them, but blew on them with his mouth, spraying saliva everywhere. That day was very cold, so his mouth and neck were both cold and...

In America, haircuts include manicures and shoe shines, but in the Soviet Union, even if you pay a lot of money, you probably won't be able to get a shoe shine.

The most agonizing thing is that there is no brush to brush off the hair after a haircut. After the haircut, he waited an hour to ask the barber to brush off the hair, but the barber kept ignoring him. It turns out that Soviet barbershops lack brushes.

### Stance

— Mi Ru

Having talked about old French paintings, perhaps I was too careless, and I have forgotten them all. But I can be sure that there is no such thing as "stance" in old French books; or perhaps there are sentence structures and meanings that can be interpreted as "stance," but I don't know. In short, the ancients did not teach me "stance," so I never knew what "stance" was, and therefore I suffered from the lack of "stance."

The first time I worked in a certain bookstore, because I was a member of the editorial department, but I often mingled with the workers, I was reprimanded by the editor-in-chief and did not receive a raise at the end of the year. I was also baffled, but I remember the editor-in-chief said: You should pay attention to your "stance."

The second time I worked in a library, because I helped the readers who borrowed books, I got the same result, but I still didn't understand what "stance" was.

The third time was even more peculiar. I don't know how I was introduced to the tax bureau in a certain place. Because I helped the merchants, I was scolded by the director again, and the result was really miserable. Not only did I gain nothing, but I was also suspended from my job.

I really don't quite understand what "stance" is. As I said before, it is probably too difficult to predict, so I never argue afterwards and always obey orders.

However, I have also studied the meaning of "stance" a little bit. I think: human beings have no "stance." Being born for human beings is the "stance" of human beings. Even if we talk about the actual situation of human beings, who is not born naked?

Perhaps I am out of touch with the times, perhaps people are too worldly, I finally don't understand the meaning of "stance."

### Dunhuang Lacquer Art

— Chang Shuhong

The origin of lacquer art can be traced back to the Former Han Dynasty, when it was used for lacquer paintings on warm mirrors, as well as lacquer paintings of women and practical objects on wooden stands. The hand towel of the Crown Prince's concubine at that time, and the large carriages of marquises and kings painted with tigers, rhinoceroses, deer, and bears, were all applications of lacquer art. The application of lacquer art gradually spread during the pre-Qin period. By the Han Dynasty, there were already records of specialized lacquer art masters such as Shentu Pan. During the Jin Dynasty, Shi Jilong used colored lacquer to paint fans. The green Shen brushes and mother-of-pearl inlaid plates of the Six Dynasties were all progressive works of lacquer art. After the Tang Dynasty, lacquer art was mixed with jade, stones, tortoiseshell, etc., making it even more refined. However, because early works used wooden bodies, they could not last for a long time, and it is impossible to see their actual shape. It was not until the unearthed Han Dynasty lacquer art from Lelang and Changsha that there was solid evidence. These recent discoveries not only allow us to know the stage of progress of ancient Chinese art, but also prove that the durability of lacquerware far exceeds that of other painting materials.

Before the war, France's most luxurious, and decadent, first-class ocean liner, the Normandie, was a representative of modern art and scientific creation. In that ocean liner, there was a living room where all the walls and furniture were successfully made using lacquer art, so it was called the Lacquer Room (Salle de Laque). This was designed by many famous painters and made by Chinese lacquer workers from southern Anhui, creating a great masterpiece. It has the luster of silk, the transparency of glass, but it can permanently maintain its fresh, dazzling, and magnificent color without being stained. This is an artistic achievement on the material, and it is also a victory for Chinese lacquer art in the current scientific and aesthetic competition.

While our country is currently blindly worshiping all kinds of cheap foreign substitutes, Chinese lacquer art has been submerged by all kinds of easy-to-dry and unreliable varnishes and enamel paints. Despite the recent finds at Lelang and Changsha...

Mr. Shen Fuwen is a realistic and successful painter, but he suspects that all current painting tools and materials cannot be preserved permanently, so he carefully and deliberately hopes to express his creations from the Chinese lacquer art tradition that is about to be lost. For more than ten years, he has painstakingly studied and incorporated the mysteries of Eastern lacquer art into his skills. His success in lacquer art has already won him national and European and American fame, which does not require our introduction. However, this exhibition is the essence of the works of past masters collected from the Dunhuang Thousand Buddha Caves in the past two years. Just as present-day artists are fearing the destruction of the world by future atomic warfare, Mr. Shen, using his exquisite and faithful copies of the precious surviving national artistic heritage of the Thousand Buddha Caves, has given himself the opportunity to preserve them permanently. This is the only hope we have for preserving the art of Dunhuang. (December 18th in Dunhuang)
