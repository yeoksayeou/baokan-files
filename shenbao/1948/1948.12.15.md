### Reinforcements Sent to Aid the Bengbu-Suxian Battlefield; Little Progress Made on Both Sides of the Southern Front; Huang Wei's Corps in Dire Straits, Fighting Bloody Battles Day and Night

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 14th] Reliable sources report: The entire 14th Army Corps under Song Xilian of the Central China crack troops is being transferred to Bengbu and will soon join the battle on the Bengbu-Suxian battlefield. Furthermore, three military trains arrived in Bengbu today, transporting armored units.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 14th] The Pacification Headquarters announced: In the Bengbu-Suxian campaign, the communist troops have suffered over 120,000 casualties in the past half-month under the Kuomintang army's "magnet and rubber" warfare tactics of attracting and annihilating them. To seize the initiative and capture the main force of the communist troops, fresh troops are being continuously deployed north of Bengbu by the military authorities.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 14th] Under the command of Generals Huang Wei and Hu Lian, the 12th Army Corps has been engaged in bloody battles for the past nineteen days against over nine columns of communist troops belonging to Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng, who are attacking the corps' positions between the Xie and Fei Rivers. The communist troops, unwilling to admit defeat, are not only reinforcing their stubborn resistance and blocking the Kuomintang army's southward and northward advances but also launching all-out assaults on the Huang Corps' positions. According to reports from various sources, the corps' situation seems to have entered a more difficult stage in the past two days. A responsible source stated: In order to concentrate forces and strengthen counterattack capabilities, the corps abandoned the strongholds of Dayingji and Luoji two days ago and formed an elliptical defensive position centered on Shuangduiji, extending about five li to the north, eight li to the south, and three li to the east and west, situated between the Xie and Fei Rivers. They have been suppressing the attacking communist troops with intense artillery fire and using tanks and cannons to fire at communist positions more than ten kilometers away to the northeast and southeast. Under the communist army's full-scale attacks, the corps finds it very difficult to find opportunities to expand outward. According to military sources, Dawangzhuang, located five li northeast of Shuangduiji, is an outer stronghold of the corps' small airfield. Communist troops have been attacking the area fiercely since last night until dawn, and fierce fighting is underway. The reporter also learned from another related source that the corps' supplies are running somewhat short. The weather has been unfavorable for the past two days, making airdrops difficult. Even with the improved weather in the past two days, relying solely on airdrops is not sufficient. Fuel is also scarce. However, under these difficult conditions, morale remains high, and they are fighting bloody battles day and night, annihilating over 60,000 stubborn communist soldiers. Huang's corps is one of the crack troops of Central China, and its safety is not only related to the success or failure of this campaign. Therefore, the authorities here are paying close attention and awaiting good news from Huang's corps, and are making their best efforts to promote the northward advance of Li's corps.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 14th] As for the southern front, which is the focus of the Bengbu-Suxian campaign, both sides were engaged in intense fighting this morning, one side seeking progress and the other seeking to obstruct it. According to the reporter's information, the Kuomintang army has captured several villages near Baojiaji, including the more important Gaowangji (ten li north of Baojiaji). The reporter heard two officials say, "Today's situation is that the Kuomintang army has made slight progress, and the communist situation has not changed." Currently, the situation on the southern front is that the right wing has reached the opposite bank of Xiawatuanji on the northern bank of the Xie River and the Gaowangji-Chenji (nearby) line, while the left wing is maneuvering westward from the area east of Baojiaji to the south side of Renheji. The entire defensive position resembles an inverted and reversed "了" character. In this state, the Kuomintang army's right wing seems to be slightly protruding, so the communist army is holding Baojiaji firmly, not only hindering the Kuomintang army's left wing but also preventing the right wing from continuing to advance. Looking at the overall situation, the development of the southern front seems to depend on strengthening combat effectiveness, and the authorities are actively deploying troops for this purpose.

### Northern Corps Continue Southward Advance; Communist Army Uses Soviet-Made Tanks; Traffic Police Corps Severely Defeats Communist Bandits in Guandian, Jiashan, and Other Places

[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] The communist troops under Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi are engaging with all their might in the war northwest of Bengbu, but from all perspectives, they have encountered strong resistance from the Kuomintang army and have been stopped. Liu Bocheng's troops have mobilized all their forces, not only their cadres but also those who have received half-training and rural laborers, and have deployed them to the battlefield to fiercely attack the Kuomintang army's Huang Wei Corps. But Huang Wei's corps has repelled the communist army's offensive, but does not have sufficient strength to break out. At the same time, the Kuomintang army's Li Yannian Corps advancing north from Bengbu has reached ten miles southeast of Shuangduiji. The distance between the Huang and Li corps is only five miles. The mechanized units assisting Li's corps are advancing step by step towards the communist troops surrounding Huang's corps, under air cover.

The Bengbu-Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announced on the 14th: The communist army attacking Li Mi's corps under General Du Yuming has used Soviet-made tanks. Four of these tanks have been seen on the battlefield. This is the first time the communist army has used Soviet-made tanks to attack the Kuomintang army.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 14th] Military sources report: General Qiu Qingquan's Second Army Corps has broken through the communist army's encirclement between Xuzhou and Suxian and reached Xiangcheng in southern Henan.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 14th] Military sources report: (1) Our frontline Kuomintang army has made new progress again today. According to the Pacification Headquarters, our Du Yuming's corps, since the 13th, annihilated the attacking communist bandits in the Weilu-Sunge area on the northern front and are now advancing south. The bandits entrenched in the two major strongholds of Lilou and Guolou are showing signs of wavering. (2) The remaining bandits trapped in Lilou and Guolou, in order to save their crisis, actually released poison gas against our attacking troops. Fortunately, we had early precautions, so there was no major damage. The Kuomintang army soldiers are extremely resentful of the bandits' inhumane behavior, so their morale is even more boosted, and the attack is even more fierce. The bandits in the two strongholds will be completely annihilated. (3) Chen Yi's 3rd, 7th, 9th, Luzhongnan columns, and Chen Geng's 9th column and the rebel troops of Wu Huawen and He Qili, etc., have been defeated by our corps marching south from Xuzhou and are currently fleeing to the areas of Suixikou, Miaogiao, and Zhongji northwest of Suxian to reorganize.

[Another Telegram] About 5,000 communist bandits from the 21st and 34th Brigades attacked our four strongholds of Guandian, Zhanglaoying, Jiashan, and Xiaowangying on the morning of the 12th. Our 3rd Traffic Police Corps (279th), under the command of Lieutenant General Zhou Weilong, severely defeated the attacking bandits head-on. From 6 am to 2 pm, the bandits were mostly defeated, with an estimated more than 1,000 bandits killed. At the same time, a division of our Kuomintang army stationed in Shaheji, Chuxian, also dispatched a unit, and at 4 pm that afternoon, annihilated a regiment of bandits in Xiaowangying. After the two groups of bandits were jointly suppressed by our traffic police corps and a division of the Kuomintang army, more than two-thirds were killed or wounded, and the remaining remnants took advantage of the thick fog at night to flee.

### The Kuomintang Army, Starting from West Yangzhou, Seizes Yangzhou Dam in Victory

[Our Correspondent in Jiangdu, 14th] The Kuomintang army, launching from Yangzhou westward, after entering Dayiji, pursued the fleeing bandits along the Yang (zhou)-Tian (chang) line westward to Qinlan, and swept northward to encircle and suppress them, successfully recovering Yangzhou Dam. It will not be difficult to annihilate the bandits in the Yangzhou-Yizheng-Tianchang triangle area soon.

[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 14th] The communist bandits in northern Jiangsu have been severely defeated by our powerful Kuomintang army in Baoying in recent days and have collapsed and retreated. The Kuomintang army has advanced to the Jieshou area, sixty li north of Baoying, and the situation is extremely peaceful. Tomorrow morning, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhenjiang-Gaoyou line will officially resume operation. The remaining bandits in the Tianchang area have also been suppressed by the Kuomintang army and have fled to the shores of Gaoyou Lake, not daring to act rashly. We are continuing our advance.

### Communist Bandits in Eastern Shaanxi Change Deployment; Most Have Been Transferred to Southern Shanxi

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 14th] According to people coming from eastern Shaanxi, the morale of the communist bandits has been low after suffering several losses in Guanzhong. They are unable to launch further attacks and, knowing that there is nothing they can do, have changed their deployment. The four columns of bandits that had been assembled near Heyang have crossed north of the civilians to southern Shanxi. Other field troops may also be transferred, leaving only the bandit chieftain Wang Zhen in Shaanxi to command scattered bandits and local communists, engaging in harassment to cover up their defeat.

### Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters Flies to Nanjing; Zhu Shaoliang Entrusts Him to Carry Important Documents

### Absolute Prohibition of Ships Sailing at Night on the River Below Tiensheng Port, Nantong; Gui Yongqing Takes a Warship Through Zhenjiang to Return to Nanjing

[Our Correspondent in Nantong, 14th] To prevent bandits from taking advantage of civilian ships to cross the river, a naval patrol team stationed on the river surface from Nantong, Chongming, Hai'an, and Qidong has stipulated that all ships (including sailboats and small steamers) are absolutely prohibited from sailing at night on the river below Tiensheng Port, Nantong. Any violation will result in the ship being sunk.

[Our Correspondent in Nantong, 14th] Gu Xijiu, commander of the Nantong Command Post, returned to Nantong on the 13th after inspecting Jingjiang. It is reported that he convened a meeting of the heads of various units in Jingjiang and gave instructions.

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 14th] Gui Yongqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, arrived in Zhenjiang on the Lingfu warship from Jiangyin on the night of the 13th. On the morning of the 14th, he inspected various ports on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River here and returned to Nanjing that evening. He said that the river defense is solid and that it is impossible for bandits to cross the river secretly. As for the Bohai Sea, it is entirely under naval control. The rumors that Lin's communist bandits in the Northeast are secretly crossing to Shandong are purely rumors, because the bandits only have sailboats in that area, which cannot be used in the Bohai Sea.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Naval sources report: The port and bay areas of Lianyungang are still under the strict control of our navy.

### Bullitt Arrives in San Francisco

He Will Submit a Report to the U.S. Government Recommending the Dispatch of American Generals to Train the Kuomintang Army

[United Press, San Francisco, 14th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, who represented the Joint Committee of the Two Houses to China for investigation, arrived here on the evening of the 13th. He will transfer to Washington. Bullitt refused to comment on the details of the trip. He reiterated that he would not make any statements before submitting a report to the committee, but it was learned from reliable sources that Bullitt had received the following information in China and elsewhere: President Chiang had been willing to accept several senior American military generals in the past two years to make them fully responsible for training the Chinese army.

It is hoped that his report will clearly state that President Chiang will fight the communists to the end. It is said that Bullitt firmly believes that President Chiang is the only Chinese political figure with sufficient strength to unify China, and that a coalition government is practically impossible to establish.

### Americans Should Urge Truman to Support the Chinese in Suppressing the Communists

Father Gorman Said

[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Father Gorman, who returned from a three-month inspection in China, said here today that the Chinese civil war may be a prelude to the Third World War. Communism is the deadly enemy of Christianity. If the communist army controls all of China, Christianity will be trampled on. The situation in Outer Mongolia and the three eastern provinces can serve as a lesson. Once communism spreads to China, one-fifth of mankind will be dominated by it, and American security and world peace and equilibrium will be undermined. Americans should urge President Truman to immediately encourage and support the Chinese people to fight to the death against the communist aggressors, just as we aided China in resisting the Japanese invaders. The sudden advice of the U.S. Embassy and consulates in China to all American citizens to evacuate is too extreme.

### U.S. Marines in Qingdao Await Next Action

[Associated Press, Qingdao, 14th] The 5,500 U.S. Marines currently stationed in Qingdao, led by Major General Thomas, a veteran of the Guadalcanal campaign, are awaiting their next action.

The Kuomintang army's defense line is about 25 miles from the city. The city's police and garrison tasks are all undertaken by Chinese military and police. The U.S. military only protects its own barracks and naval facilities. Since April, there have been no incidents between the U.S. military and the communists. U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers here believe that the communists will not create trouble and lightly start a conflict with the U.S. side. A responsible naval officer said that if "something happens, the Navy has enough ships and aircraft to evacuate the Marines and Navy personnel.

### Madame Chiang's Trip to America

— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing from New York

The special plane "Holy Cow" brought Madame Chiang from California to Washington. On the morning of December 1st, the Washington National Airport was crowded with groups of reporters. Madame Chiang, showing signs of fatigue, stepped off the plane. Ambassador Gu was the first to step forward to shake her hand in welcome. A young and beautiful girl, whom they called "Judy Wang," presented Madame Chiang with a bouquet of flowers. In the short minutes of the hustle and bustle, the impression was vivid enough.

Mrs. Marshall initially sat in the airport lounge. She squeezed through the crowd and called out "Hello" to Madame Chiang! All American newspapers highlighted this point, because Mrs. Marshall was the only representative "selected" from the current Truman administration to welcome Madame Chiang. Needless to say, Truman himself would not come to the airport to greet her. Neither Mrs. Truman nor his daughter came. Even Marshall himself, quickly using "medical check-up" as an excuse, slipped into Washington's "Walter Reed" Hospital to avoid it. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett also did not come. As for others, no senators or congressmen were to be seen, not even a shadow.

Madame Chiang's heart was filled with sadness, even more "uncomfortable" than Shen Baoxu, the Chu state official more than two thousand years ago. Shen Baoxu's wailing in the Qin court was the first time in his life for him personally, while Madame Chiang today came to Washington for the sake of the country and endured all kinds of "embarrassments." Although the starting point was similar to Shen Baoxu's, from her personal perspective, it was not something an ordinary woman could handle. Only six short years had passed. On the same day six years ago, at the same airport, Madame Chiang was treated like a "treasure" by the American government and public. Six years later today, it was still the same Madame Chiang, but she encountered such an embarrassing coldness.

All the American newspapers used the word "coldness" to describe Madame Chiang's "Qin court" trip. A leftist Chinese newspaper in New York said that Madame Chiang was "eating cold soup." Truman was usually vague about everything, but he was decisive on the Chinese issue, and his attitude was very arrogant. After the election results were announced, Truman was vacationing on the Florida coast. At that time, the situation in China began to reverse. Some Republican members of Congress advocated for emergency appropriations, and some advocated for a special session of Congress, but Truman ignored them all. He wore a half-sleeved shirt and did his "soft exercises" on the beach. At that time, Marshall was in Paris. Shanghai telegrams transmitted by the Associated Press and United Press said that Marshall had promised Wang Shijie in Paris to guarantee increased aid to China. This was truly a miracle. Later, when Marshall returned to Washington, I asked Marshall about it in person at a press conference, and he completely denied it. (Continued on page four)

### Editorial: Starting with the Atlantic Pact

After the unsatisfactory conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly, the international situation has become even more serious. How the United States will cope with future developments is being closely watched by the world. According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse in Washington on the 13th, President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and congressional leaders Vandenberg and Connally all advocated that the United States should strengthen its assistance to Western European countries under the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact, thereby promoting the unity of Western European countries. At the same time, the U.S. National Security Council also held the same view and believed that once the Atlantic Pact was signed, negotiations on the conclusion of a Mediterranean defense treaty would be conducted to establish a global security system to jointly defend against Soviet aggression.

From this report, it is not difficult to see the following facts: (1) The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan are still the backbone of the United States' future foreign policy. In other words, the United States' old tune of "anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union" remains unchanged. (2) The focus of American diplomatic activities is still in Europe. In other words, no matter how serious the crisis in Asia is, Marshall's policy of "Europe first, Asia second" will remain unchanged. Regardless of whether the Atlantic Pact and the Mediterranean Pact can be realized as desired by the American diplomatic authorities, we cannot help but be skeptical about whether the conclusion of these two pacts constitutes the establishment of a global security system.

The concept of organizing the Atlantic Group originated during World War II. The British and American governments and people all held supportive attitudes towards this new international movement, but it ultimately failed to materialize because people yearned for the prospect of "One World." At that time, the famous American journalist Walter Lippmann wrote articles advocating it and put forward a concrete proposal. He advocated that the countries participating in the Atlantic Group should include countries in North and South America and European countries such as Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Greece, Italy, and Iceland. Even the Union of South Africa in Africa, and countries in the Pacific such as Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, should all participate. Today, the American diplomatic authorities want to organize Mediterranean joint defense after the Atlantic Pact, which is the practice of Lippmann's proposal to promote the realization of the Atlantic Group through the two pacts.

These two pacts are currently being negotiated in Washington. From the perspective of current practical needs, they are indeed jointly needed by countries on both sides of the Atlantic. For Western Europe, if it wants to resist the communist forces from Eastern Europe invading Western Europe today, it must rely on the economic and military assistance of the United States and Canada. And for the United States, for the sake of anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union, it also needs to move its defense line to Western European countries. Therefore, we predict that the negotiations in Washington will definitely proceed very smoothly and a satisfactory result can be reached soon. At the same time, we can also assert that the conclusion of these two pacts will definitely have a great impact on resisting international aggression and promoting world peace.

However, from the perspective of the entire world, whether the Atlantic Pact and the Mediterranean Pact can achieve their task of defending world peace is a serious question. Because world peace is indivisible, even if the countries on both sides of the Atlantic can unite like iron and jointly resist international aggression, so as to maintain local peace and security, as long as there is turmoil and unrest or war elsewhere one day, the Atlantic will not have the possibility of surviving safely. The lessons of history are valuable and most worthy of deep reflection by politicians and diplomats of various countries. Taking the current international situation as an example, Western European countries can survive for a while under the Marshall Plan and the Western European Pact. Now adding icing on the cake and concluding an Atlantic Pact seems to make them feel even more secure, but looking at the situation in Asia, from Southeast Asia to China, and from China to Northeast Asia, there is no place that does not show the seriousness of the Asian crisis. And the United States insists on implementing the policy of "Europe first, Asia second," and even regards the anti-communist vanguard—China—as almost insignificant, and sits idly by as Asia sinks. The United States may still think it is a good plan at the moment, thinking that the Atlantic Pact can guarantee world peace, but it does not know that "Europe first, Asia second" will inevitably lead to a historical mistake, and it will eventually swallow the bitter fruit, and the Atlantic Pact and the Mediterranean Pact will also lose their meaning. The lessons of history must not be ignored!

Politicians talk about reality, and diplomats especially need to pay attention to reality. Now that the Atlantic Pact is being negotiated in Washington, we hope that the politicians and diplomats in Washington can face reality, not be stubborn, have no prejudices, and re-establish a global security system. The people of Asia are all looking forward to the next action in Washington!

### Legislative Yuan's 28th Meeting Passes Resolution to Establish Mongolian Counseling Group to Commend Ma Hongkui and Ningxia Corps

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The 28th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 14th. The meeting opened at 9:30 in the morning. The President and Vice President were absent due to various reasons. Lei Yin was elected as the chairman. After passing the minutes of the previous meeting, Zhao Huimo and Luo Heng reported on their visit to Bengbu to comfort the troops. Then, temporary motions were dealt with: (1) Guang Lu and 112 others proposed that the assembly send a telegram in the name of the assembly to commend General Ma Hongda and all the officers and soldiers of the Ningxia Corps to encourage them. The resolution was passed. (2) Zhang Zhijiang and others proposed requesting a telegram to urge President Sun to return to Beijing immediately to form a responsible cabinet, start work, and reverse the crisis. Committee member Wu Shangying explained that Sun had already been discharged from the hospital with illness and was scheduled to go to Beijing on the 15th to take over the matter. Most committee members believed that there was no need to send a telegram to urge him, and the resolution was postponed to the next regular meeting for discussion. The meeting members debated this motion for a long time and adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at 3:30 in the afternoon. Temporary motions: (3) Zhao Zhenzhou and others proposed improving the current method of gold and silver exchange to avoid manipulation and control by a few people, leading to sudden wealth. The resolution was submitted to the Finance and Finance Committee for review. Then, the agenda items listed for discussion were carried out. The first case was the report of the Legal System and Border Affairs Committee on the review of the proposal by Wu Yunpeng and others to accommodate Mongolian exiles, assist in the promotion of Mongolian administration, strengthen the suppression of chaos, and stabilize the hearts of the Mongolian people. It was proposed to temporarily establish a Mongolian Counseling Group in the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee. The resolution was based on the review opinions to amend the draft organizational regulations of the Mongolian Counseling Group to establish the Organizational Regulations of the Committee for Employment and Education Counseling for Exiled Mongolians of the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee, which was passed after three readings. The second case was the report of the Health and Legal System Committee on the review of Articles 8, 9, and 13 of the Organizational Regulations of the Black Fever Prevention and Control Office of the Ministry of Health. The resolution was passed as is. The third case was the report of the Social and Legal System Committee on the review of the draft amendment to the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Some committee members raised opinions on the duties of the various departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Social Affairs, believing that since there was already a Workers' Cooperative Labor Bureau in the ministry, it was a redundant organization and there was no need to establish it. If the bureau was a temporary agency, it should not be included in the regular Organizational Law. Some committee members also pointed out that the amendments to the names of some departments in the review opinions were inappropriate. The discussion was adjourned at around 5 o'clock. When it was planned to continue the meeting at 5:30, the meeting place suddenly lost power and the meeting could not proceed, so it was adjourned. The third case and the remaining cases that were not discussed were all postponed to the next regular meeting for discussion.

### The United States Considers Re-arming Japan: Establishing a Police Force of 150,000 to Cope with the Current Drastic Changes in the Far East Situation

[United Press Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] Well-informed sources in the defense sector told United Press on the thirteenth that the United States is considering establishing an armed police force of 100,000 to 150,000 men in Japan. They stated that, from a military perspective, the United States' Far East policy does not plan to make drastic changes, but it is gradually evolving to prevent Japan from becoming a vacuum after the withdrawal of the occupation forces. The first formal consideration of this matter by the United States was based on Lieutenant General Eichelberger's endorsement of Japan forming a 125,000-man armed police force after returning from Japan. Subsequently, the situation in China deteriorated, raising new questions regarding the United States' policy in Asia, and leading to consideration of organizing a Japanese security force. However, well-informed sources in the defense sector insisted that there are no plans for drastic changes. They pointed out that all occupation forces in Japan are mandated by policy to disarm Japan, and the Japanese constitution also stipulates that Japan complete disarmament. However, Japan can maintain a certain amount of military force within its territory for police purposes and maintaining order. On the other hand, it is stated that the planned Japanese force of 150,000 men would not conflict with policy or the constitution. It is rumored that a few months ago, MacArthur endorsed providing the Chinese government with a large amount of army supplies unused by the occupation forces. However, the current situation has changed, and inventory that was considered surplus or unusable a few months ago is now regarded as important for defense. For example, parts for C-54 aircraft have been taken from the inventory stockpile for use. Given the changing situation, according to unconfirmed reports, MacArthur has requested strong reinforcements and asked US policy makers to consider arming Japan. It is not yet known whether the National Security Council is considering this policy. The decisions of the committee are highly confidential, and even if a decision has been made, it will not be announced. However, sources at a lower level than the committee stated that the United States is proceeding with preparations for an armed Japanese force. These sources all stated that when the occupation forces withdraw from Japan, Japan obviously cannot be without a military force. Therefore, Japan needs to establish and train a strong and well-disciplined military force. These sources also carefully pointed out that neither the US State Department nor the National Security Council can decide on US policy. President Truman and Congress may repeal the policies and orders of both and re-formulate the entire Far East policy. Based on past trends, Truman and Congress often listen to the advice of the State Department and the War Department.

[United Press Tokyo Fourteenth Dispatch] US officials here revealed on the fourteenth that the Japanese police have already expanded to the authorized limit of 125,000 men. This limit has been criticized by China and the Soviet Union as a "new army," but the United States considers it insufficient. Allied headquarters officials declined to comment on news from Washington. According to that news, the United States is considering expanding the Japanese police and arming them to a sufficient extent.

### Ignoring the Urgent Situation in the Far East, the United Nations Makes a Big Mistake: Evatt Advocates Speeding up the Conclusion of Peace Treaties with Japan, Germany, and Austria

[United Press Paris Thirteenth Dispatch] UN General Assembly President Evatt stated on the thirteenth that the East-West tension has eased, but warned that "neglecting the Far East and the Pacific region is a great mistake, because the crisis in that region is currently quite acute." Evatt condemned the disputes among major powers as the cause of the failure of the Paris conference. He also emphasized the need to swiftly conclude peace treaties with Japan, Germany, and Austria, considering this a step towards bringing peace to the world.

In a written statement to reporters in the almost abandoned Chaillot Palace assembly hall, Evatt stated, "Due to the convening of the UN General Assembly, the tension among major powers in September has eased. However, the patient's temperature has not yet returned to normal, but the fever has subsided. The second half of the session will be held in New York on April 1st next year, instead of being postponed until the fall, in order to prevent the rifts among the major powers from deepening and causing war. Of course, all people around the world do not want war. Although the United Nations and all its procedures are not the only help in promoting peace treaties with Germany and Austria, they are at least the best way."

### A Major Political Storm in Japan: Finance Minister Izumiyama, Drunk, Molests Two Female Legislators: Majority of Legislators Demand Resignation of Yoshida Cabinet

[United Press Tokyo Fourteenth Dispatch] Due to Finance Minister Izumiyama's "drunken molestation" of two female legislators on the evening of the thirteenth, a majority of Japanese legislators decided on the fourteenth to demand the total resignation of the Yoshida cabinet. As public opinion seethed over the public accusation by one of the "insulted" women, Izumiyama resigned from his post as Finance Minister on the morning of the fourteenth and resigned from his seat in the afternoon, just as a special parliamentary committee was about to expel him.

When Shigeru Yoshida came to power two months ago, he declared that he would eradicate "scandals" in the government so that Japan could be respected by the international community. His opposition party has quickly seized this heaven-sent opportunity. Izumiyama did not defend himself, but said that his wife remained unwavering in her belief in him. He was still hungover and slightly unwell on the fourteenth. Due to the major storm caused by the Izumiyama case, the supplementary budget of 70 billion yen and the no-confidence motion proposed by the opposition party on the thirteenth were shelved.

[United Press Tokyo Fourteenth Dispatch] Fifty-two-year-old Japanese Finance Minister Izumiyama Sangō resigned from his cabinet post on the morning of the fourteenth. Yoshida accepted the resignation and temporarily appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry Oya Shinzō as acting Finance Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Shūtō Hideo as acting Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. Due to Izumiyama's drunkenness, his inability to attend meetings, and the accusations of female legislators against his "improper behavior," the parliamentary agenda for discussing the 70 billion yen subsidy budget was delayed. Although members of the House of Representatives had been meeting overnight in the Diet Building, many members, exhausted from the all-night meeting, remained in the Diet Building until 10:00 am on the fourteenth, sleeping on chairs and desks. The opposition declared that the budget must be passed before they would vote on a no-confidence motion against the Yoshida cabinet. The opposition party and the government are still arguing over the new base salary for civil servants. The former advocates raising the base salary of civil servants to 6,307 yen, while the government only advocates increasing it to 5,330 yen. At the same time, Yoshida reiterated his determination to dissolve the Diet and let the people decide. According to general indications, the Diet will be dissolved on the fifteenth so that a general election can be held in January next year.

### Female Legislator Reports on Izumiyama's Muddled Account

Mrs. Yamashita spoke vividly

[United Press Tokyo Fourteenth Dispatch] Mrs. Yamashita (47 years old), one of the two female legislators who were "molested," was summoned to attend a parliamentary committee report in the afternoon of the fourteenth. She reported that Izumiyama entered the Diet dining room at 6:00 pm on the thirteenth and immediately shouted at the waiter. I felt he was a bit reckless. He quickly poured down two cups of rice wine. A vice-minister entered, and Izumiyama toasted with him. Later, Izumiyama sat next to me and said, "It's too stuffy here. Let's go outside." He dragged me into the corridor. I asked him, "What are you doing?" Izumiyama replied, "There's no one here." Then he forcibly hugged me, and then he behaved recklessly. I can't say it here. Before that, I told him that people in the government were busy with the new salary base and the supplementary budget, and that he shouldn't be getting drunk. But he said, "Don't worry about that, let's go find a place." He didn't listen to me. Mrs. Yamashita also told the committee, "Up until now, I have only met Izumiyama twice. This case not only affects our fifteen legislators, but it is also closely related to all women in Japan. The reason why we ran for election was to protect all women from being trampled on by people like Izumiyama. Some people say that I was also drunk, but I reported Izumiyama's molestation in the Diet last night, which proves that I was not drunk."

The other "insulted" woman, Mrs. Matsuo (41 years old), told reporters that Izumiyama had tightly held her hand. However, she said, "I don't want to make a fuss. Of course, I think there should be etiquette between male and female legislators, but I don't want to make a report like Mrs. Yamashita. As I see it, aren't most men like Izumiyama?"

### Arab Countries' Tendency to Split over the Holy Land Issue Becomes Overt: Egypt and Other Countries Oppose Transjordan's Annexation of the Holy Land: Transjordan Conducts Peace Negotiations with Israel

[United Press Beirut Fourteenth Dispatch] The possible split among Arab countries over the Palestinian issue became overt on the fourteenth. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon are united in opposing Transjordan's annexation of the eastern part of the Holy Land. The Transjordan parliament announced on the fourteenth that King Abdullah will be "King of the United Kingdom of Transjordan and Palestine" and has taken steps to include Palestinian Arabs in the Transjordan cabinet in Amman.

The Iraqi parliament is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on the fourteenth to decide whether Iraq will support Abdullah or join other Arab countries, as the ruler of Iraq is a relative of King Abdullah. Transjordan officials apparently attach importance to Iraq's position, as Iraqi troops occupy part of the territory annexed by Abdullah. If Iraq opposes the annexation, Transjordan will stand alone against all other countries in the Arab League. According to a dispatch from Amman, Transjordan officials said that they were deeply saddened by the attitude of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. They believe that annexation is the best path for Palestinian Arabs. The exact areas of Palestine annexed by King Abdullah have not yet been determined, but it is reported that they include the entire Arab Palestine. However, the areas occupied by the Arab Legion are only the central part of Eastern Palestine, while Egyptian troops occupy the southern part. Another dispatch states that King Abdullah has instructed the Prime Minister of Transjordan to expand his cabinet to accommodate Palestinian Arabs and concentrate on sending Arab refugees back to their hometowns. The cabinet will prepare to hold elections in Palestine to elect members to participate in the Transjordan parliament. At the same time, Transjordan is conducting armistice and permanent peace negotiations with Israel. Although these negotiations are presumed to include all Arab countries, a dispatch from Tel Aviv states that Transjordan may make peace with Israel alone. The movement to merge Transjordan and Arab Palestine became apparent after the Juri Valley meeting on December 1. At the Juri Valley meeting, all Arab leaders in northern and central Palestine wanted to merge the two regions into one.

### British, American, and French Zones of Berlin to Be Merged: Germans Call for Reorganization of German Military

[United Press Berlin Thirteenth Dispatch] British occupation army officials stated that the American, British, and French occupation zones of West Berlin may be immediately merged under the legitimate government of Berlin.

[United Press Berlin Fourteenth Dispatch] Schmidt, a representative of the right-wing Social Democratic Party at the Bonn Constitutional Convention, called for the "reorganization of the German military" on the thirteenth. Schmidt wrote an article for the German "Welt" newspaper published by the British military government, advocating that the German armed forces be incorporated into an international army. He said that the "collective security" system of Western Europe cannot be created without Germany's participation.

### The Dutch Military May Launch a Decisive Attack on Indonesia Before Christmas; Indonesian Leaders Remain Willing to Negotiate a Settlement with the Netherlands

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 14th dispatch: The Mediation Committee reported to the Security Council that leaders of the Indonesian Republic requested the committee to advise the Dutch government to seek a peaceful resolution. It is said that the Indonesians are still willing to consider a reasonable solution. The next day, a report from the Dutch side stated that continued negotiations were impossible and that they intended to establish a provisional federal government for all of Indonesia.

[Central News Agency, Yogyakarta, 13th dispatch, United Press] The Indonesian Republic calmly awaits Dutch military action, which is expected to continue within six weeks. In fact, people from all parties in the Republic believe that the Dutch decision to cease negotiations with the Republic is tantamount to a warning that the Dutch will resume last year's "police action." Informed sources say the Dutch may launch a full-scale offensive before Christmas, but the imminent arrival of the UN Mediation Committee is likely to reduce the possibility of such action occurring sooner.

[United Press, Amsterdam, 13th dispatch] The left-wing newspaper "Het Parool" predicted on the 13th that war was inevitable in Indonesia before Christmas and called on the United States to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. The newspaper commented on its front page that the Netherlands was preparing to "take military action against the Indonesian Republic, and the Dutch government has begun to prepare the people to believe that there is no other way." The article stated that the Netherlands was completely correct in this dispute, but the world political situation forced them to consider foreign opinions.

### Supervisory Committee Branch Sends Personnel to Review Accounts; Suspicion of Favoritism in Gold Exchange Discovered; Over Two Thousand Taels Exchanged Without Queuing

Expresses Determination to Thoroughly Investigate the Rice-for-Cotton Cloth Swap Case

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, reporters visited the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Supervisory Committee Branch to inquire about the two major cases recently investigated by the branch: the Central Bank's handling of gold deposits and exchanges, and the limited-price period rice-for-cotton cloth swap. Supervisor Ni Bi and Branch Secretary Wang Yawu informed us that regarding the suspicion of corruption in the National Bank's gold deposits and exchanges, personnel had been sent three times to conduct on-site investigations. A review of the accounts revealed that National Bank employees had exchanged over two thousand taels of gold without queuing. As for the alleged irregularities in the distribution of application forms by the Central Bank on the 10th of this month as reported in various newspapers, it was found that the first application form was issued to an employee of the Bank of China, and the third was given to a student, possibly due to favoritism by the gatekeeper, who provided convenience to relatives and friends. As for other rumors of bank employees colluding with large clients and secretly collecting handling fees, no evidence has yet been obtained, and the branch will continue to investigate.

Regarding the rice-for-cotton cloth swap case, the branch has appointed an investigation team led by Zhang Zhengzong to conduct an investigation and will visit relevant agencies in the coming days for inquiries. Secretary Wang emphasized that rice is a necessity for people's livelihood, and its supply can affect the stability of social order. The branch has the power to exercise supervisory powers, and the inside story of this case is complex and intriguing. It is the duty of the branch to thoroughly investigate, reveal the whole truth to the public, and, if there is indeed evidence of corruption, submit it to the Supervisory Yuan for strict investigation. The Central Bank and the China Textile Construction Company will be notified that all cotton cloth will be suspended from allocation until the entire case is clarified. At the same time, during the limited-price period, organs, schools, citizens, etc., in this city stored rice at rice shops. Subsequently, some rice shops used the excuse of being snapped up to forcibly settle payments in cash at limited prices. The Supervisory Committee has received many complaints of this kind, and it is now planned to investigate them all thoroughly.

The Rice Merchants Association sent representatives, including Yin Fuxiang, and more than ten others to the Textile Construction Company around 4:00 p.m. on the 14th to request that the 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth be allowed to be picked up. Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing met with them. According to Mr. Wu, the National Bank had promised to allocate cotton yarn at a limited price for the cotton cloth at that time, but the National Bank has not yet allocated the cotton yarn, so it is not convenient to allow the cotton cloth to be picked up. A final decision can be made after he consults with the National Bank.

### Stampede Occurs, Resulting in Fights; Six People Injured in Front of Two Banks; Flying Fortresses Deployed to Suppress

Because the modified methods for gold and silver deposits and exchanges have not yet been announced, the exchange situation yesterday was unprecedentedly crowded.

The situation was particularly tense at the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. Groups of local ruffians and scalpers were mixed in, and the order was chaotic, leading to fights.

### Director Bi Delin of the Gold Control Bureau Officially Assumed Office Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] The newly appointed Director Bi Delin of the Gold Control Bureau of this city officially assumed office at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Shi Shouchang, Director of the Goods Tax Bureau dispatched by the Ministry of Finance, supervised the event, and there were many well-wishers from the financial and industrial and commercial circles. Mr. Bi stated that everything would be done in accordance with laws and regulations in the future to strive for financial stability.

Furthermore, according to government laws and regulations, people are allowed to hold gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency, but only silver coins are allowed to circulate and be bought and sold. The permission for silver bars to circulate and be bought and sold is to facilitate payment and exchange and the use of large amounts of gold yuan certificates, and not to use silver coins as a tool for profit. The current silver dollar transactions on the market are clearly in violation of the above regulations. The Gold Control Bureau has been ordered to ban all black markets for gold, banknotes, and silver dollars, and will strictly enforce this in conjunction with relevant agencies.

### Frontline Comfort Mission Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing; Firmly Believes that the Battle Will Definitely Achieve Brilliant Results

[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Municipal All-Circles Comfort Mission to the Frontline Soldiers returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon after completing its mission of comforting the troops on the Bengbu front. This reporter accompanied the mission to visit the war zone and witnessed the strong and vigorous morale and loyal patriotic spirit of the National Army on the front lines. It is firmly believed that the Battle of Suxian-Bengbu will definitely achieve brilliant results, and the Huai River will surely become the graveyard of the Chinese Communist bandits. This battle will also reflect the Battle of Fei River, which shines in the history books. At the forefront of North China, this reporter personally witnessed the National Army bravely charging and killing with superior firepower, defeating a regiment of Chen Yi's bandits in one hour. In the process of suppressing the bandits, Chiang Wei-kuo, the President's second son and Chief of Staff, personally led his tank unit to charge at high speed, achieving the task of coordinating infantry to advance forward. Mr. Chiang's personal command on the front lines gave the soldiers great encouragement.

Commander Li Yannian told reporters in a firm tone on the front lines that the National Army will definitely win the battle in the Huaibei battlefield. He pointed out that since the beginning of the battle, under the correct strategic guidance, the National Army has eliminated most of the Communist bandits' main combat forces and disintegrated the Communist bandits' fragile combat will. The current bandits have become shaken, and many have surrendered with their weapons in recent days, which is in stark contrast to our strong morale. The elite troops led by Division Commander Liu Cuigao, who had just retreated from the Northeast, have rushed to the north bank of the Huai River and launched a fierce offensive to accelerate the convergence of the Northern Expeditionary Army and Huang Wei's Corps. All officers and soldiers of the division have strong fighting spirit. Most of the National Army on the Huaibei front are veterans who have experienced hundreds of battles and are very interested in the strict military life. Their national consciousness is particularly strong. The visit of the Comfort Mission from Nanjing and Shanghai to comfort the troops on the front lines made the battlefield full of gunpowder reveal human warmth, and the officers and soldiers were even more encouraged. The frontline soldiers are willing to win continuous victories to earn continuous comfort, and the people in the rear are willing to use continuous comfort to welcome continuous victories.

Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi said in his speech in thanks to the Comfort Mission that he is determined to win a comprehensive victory in suppressing the bandits and repay the material and spiritual comfort of the compatriots in the rear. He also called on the compatriots in Nanjing and Shanghai to eliminate pessimistic and defeatist sentiments and fully support the war against the bandits, and the future can definitely be optimistic.

Zheng Shouye, the Business Manager of the Jiangya Steamer, and the survivors explained the circumstances of the ship's explosion and sinking at the time. Then, the steamer returned. They arrived at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf at about 6:00 p.m. It was also heard that the prosecutors will schedule another inspection when the wind and waves subside.

Before the salvage ships sailed back to the port to avoid the wind yesterday, a female body was salvaged. It was transported to Shanghai yesterday evening.

Family Members of the Victims Ask for Relief

According to Ye Rongzhang, the leader of the relief team of the Jiangya Steamer Disaster Aftermath Committee of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, many family members of the dead fellow villagers have asked the team for relief in recent days. However, the team's recent funds are only enough to barely meet the needs of emergency relief, so there is no way to help them. However, it is not a good way to sit idly by and do nothing. It is hoped that the committee will establish a fundraising team and immediately mobilize to raise money or in-kind donations to start handling the aftermath relief. According to Zhou Haoran, the deputy leader of the team, the current stage of the team's relief work is limited to the victims who escaped the disaster. However, in recent days, many family members have come to the team to request the issuance of free boat tickets to escort coffins back to their hometowns or to return to their hometowns after receiving bodies from Shanghai. In order to take into account the actual situation, the team has sent personnel to verify the facts and has given them flexible processing and issued certificates.

Mayor Wu Guozhen served as the Chairman of the Presidium and delivered a welcoming speech, stating briefly: In the past two and a half years, the city has experienced hundreds of crises, but thanks to the assistance and cooperation of Commander Xuan, we were able to overcome them safely. Today, Commander Xuan is honorably transferred to the new position of Deputy Director of the Quzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, and we feel infinite reluctance to part with him. Wu expressed deep gratitude to Xuan for his past spirit of cooperation and expressed hope that Commander Chen Daqing would maintain this spirit of cooperation with all local circles at this time of greater difficulty and hardship, jointly take responsibility for maintaining the security of Shanghai, and make it as secure as a rock. Wu also praised Port Commander Zhou Lixing for his past achievements and welcomed Commander Zeng Jiqing, praising his close cooperation with all circles in relevant logistics work.

The Gap Between Rich and Poor Should Be Narrowed Quickly

Following Wu's speech, Commander Xuan expressed his gratitude for the kindness of all parties and offered parting words. He particularly pointed out that Shanghai's current relatively well-off situation is the result of the spiritual cooperation of the party, government, military, and people, and has been achieved through some storms and difficulties, not by chance. The current problems are even more serious, and he feels sorry to leave at this time, but he firmly believes that Shanghai already has a good foundation for cooperation, and by working hard on this foundation, Shanghai can continue to be stable and further stabilize the whole country. He expressed his feelings after presiding over military and police work in Shanghai for more than two years: There is no need to avoid the fact that the lifestyles of Shanghai's six million citizens today have not yet reached fairness and rationality, and there are still many gaps and conflicts of interest. If these factors are not eliminated, Shanghai will still be dangerous. He said: Due to the past economic system, there is a clear gap between the rich and poor among the people of Shanghai. At the present stage of the life-and-death struggle with the communists, this gap should be narrowed quickly. How to make six million people live in harmony and work together, coordinate and unite, and become a whole force is the goal that should be actively pursued today.

Stability is the First Priority

Today, a few people only know how to escape, but they do not know that if the dangerous factors existing in Shanghai can be eliminated first, Shanghai will be no different from an iron fortress, so why worry about the communists? He finally said that Quzhou is now the second line of defense and is closely related to Shanghai. He hopes that all circles will continue to give advice from time to time so that the second line of defense can be consolidated.

The newly appointed Garrison Commander Chen Daqing said in his speech how to make Shanghai's commerce continue to develop and prosper, how to make Shanghai's culture and education continue to progress, and still become the leader of the country. He contributed three points of opinion as the goal of joint efforts: (1) Labor-management cooperation to solve the current difficulties of industry and commerce; (2) To exert the correct and constructive power of public opinion and lead the people to cooperate with the government; (3) Only under the situation of consolidated security and normal order can all work be carried out, so stability is the first priority. He frankly admitted that there are still some shortcomings in the military and is making effective improvements. Then, City Councilor Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech on behalf of all circles to bid farewell and welcome. He solemnly pointed out that Commander Xuan's parting words and Commander Chen's three instructions are worthy of deep understanding and gratitude from all citizens. He listed several of Xuan's achievements in Shanghai, saying: A few sparks can start a prairie fire, and the military and police led by Xuan extinguished them in time. The people may not be aware of it because it did not start a prairie fire, but if it did, the consequences would be unimaginable? Xuan's execution of maintaining autumn order under the requirements of freedom and democracy was really not easy. Pan believed that Commander Chen would "follow the rules of Xiao and Cao" and continue to make Shanghai stable. Pan emphasized the meaning of "self-help," appealing to all Shanghai citizens to be thoroughly enlightened today, seek their own blessings, and must first have a strong popular morale in order to have a strong military morale, and must first fulfill the national duty in order to eventually achieve national freedom. Therefore, we must contribute all our strength to support the government and use the power of the people to change this situation and change the views of international people. As Hoffman and Badger said, "Only the Chinese can save China." If we can save ourselves, foreign aid will gradually flow in. Finally, Pan presented Commander Xuan with a large silver tripod, and the meeting adjourned in a warm atmosphere.

### Emergency Meeting of Private Yarn Factories; Requesting Government to Maintain Them

[Reported by this newspaper] The cotton textile associations and private yarn factories in the Su, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai areas held an emergency meeting yesterday. Since the private yarn factories have been in charge of unified purchase, unified sales, and代纺代织, the losses this year have been considerable. In addition, during the currency reform period, the limited-price sale of yarn could not be replenished, and the damage was even greater. At present, maintaining the status quo is quite difficult, and the year-end bonus cannot be afforded. Therefore, a resolution was made on the spot: (1) To send a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Executive Yuan requesting relief; (2) To appoint representatives Rong Erren, Guo Dihuo, Liu Jingji, Wang Zhuyi, Liu Piji, Lu Ziwen, Yuan Guoliang, Cheng Jingtang, Zhu Fuju, Tang Huaru and other ten people to visit Mayor Wu and Director Wu yesterday afternoon to state the actual difficulties of the current yarn factory industry and ask the government to maintain them.

### Madame Chiang's Trip to the United States (Continued from the First Edition)

Some say: Madame Chiang came late this time. A month, if she had come earlier, the situation might not have been so rigid. This statement is reasonable. This time, Madame Chiang came after the Truman-Marshall talks decided on the policy. It is not convenient for the current US government to make a change easily. This is a fact. The so-called "Truman-Marshall talks" were after Truman won the election and Marshall finished his task of attending the UN General Assembly and returned with a belly full of "resentment." In order to win the votes of women and children for Truman's despicable "Vincent Incident," he did not hesitate to sacrifice the Secretary of State. Marshall came back, originally intending to erupt and erupt specially. First, he wanted to question Truman, what kind of tricks did he want to play? The second step. Then he and Secretary of Defense Forrestal resigned together.

However, Truman also had his own slick way. He comforted Marshall calmly, saying that Marshall was a first-class talented patriot. Marshall accepted such a series of "high hats" and finally temporarily dismissed the intention of resigning. Afterwards, Truman and Marshall began to discuss the world crisis. Truman fully supported the "Marshall Plan" to aid Europe. What about Asia? The cost is too high, let's wait and see for the time being! In this way, Truman also issued a series of statements on China policy: no loans, no sending MacArthur, evacuating overseas Chinese, and even issuing a statement that "the official did not invite Madame Chiang"!

Madame Chiang came one step late, but she still did not refuse to come. The American national character has a strange habit. They often show special sympathy for those who do not avoid difficulties and dangers, are not afraid of embarrassment, and struggle to the end on their own. The Truman election was an example. After Madame Chiang arrived in Washington, the Chinese Embassy received many official letters from organizations inviting Madame Chiang to give a speech. When the author wrote this message, the plan for Madame Chiang's speech had not yet been decided. Most people with insight advocated that Madame Chiang should give a public speech and tell the American people frankly from the East Coast to the West Coast about China's situation and the attitude of the Truman government so that the American people can have a fair criticism.

Because the Truman government's policy towards China has not been clear until now, the American media rarely mentions Madame Chiang's visit this time. Before the Truman-Marshall talks, The New York Times had repeatedly called for strengthening aid to China. After the Truman-Marshall statement was issued, deciding to continue to maintain the "no policy policy," The Times no longer spoke. Instead, a small newspaper in New York, the "New York Mirror," wrote an article severely criticizing the "State Department" after Washington showed coldness to Madame Chiang, saying that the State Department was doing confused diplomacy and that the experts in the State Department had not read the history of the Far East carefully. Therefore, on the one hand, they supported Europe's anti-communism, and on the other hand, they called on China to tolerate communism.

The commentator of the New York Mirror cited Li Hongzhang's and Lobanov's 1898 Sino-Russian Treaty to illustrate the Tsar's ambition to attach importance to the East, and then talked about today's Stalin's approach to the Tsar's practice, and even the blindness of the United States' foreign policy towards the Far East in recent years. The Mirror said: "Only such confused diplomats would do this." "They would: when they are happy, they would praise Madame Chiang as a god. When they are not happy, they would run away to the hospital, letting the female leader of our allied countries for many years be treated like a refugee in Washington"!

The brave Madame Chiang, she ran to the hospital to find Marshall and had two long talks. The content has not been released yet. ABC Radio reported that "Madame Chiang visited Marshall in the hospital, and Marshall's attitude was as arrogant as if he were receiving representatives of the German and "this" people."

A radio reporter from WBC humorously reported that "Truman has been busy rearranging the treasures of the United States these days, so that the brave Madame Chiang can't find where the American gold and silver are"?

When will Madame Chiang be able to discover this treasure? When will she be able to win sympathy? That depends on the timing and the use of wisdom. But in any case, Madame Chiang is loved by the American people. The editor of the New York Herald Tribune, Donler (Columbia Professor), wrote: "No matter how good or bad the national policy is, Madame Chiang is always respected and loved by the American people. She is the first foreign woman in American history to be able to win the widespread praise of the American people"!

### Private Universities and Colleges Decide to End Early; Examination Dates for Each School Determined; Decision to Start Next Semester Early

[Reported by this newspaper] The presidents of private universities and colleges in this city met at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 3:00 PM yesterday.

During the meeting, the presidents of the schools decided to end the current semester early in view of the fact that students in South China have been asking for leave to return to their hometowns, and students in the war zone have had their economic sources cut off. In order to adapt to the situation and take into account the facts, Zhijiang decided to start the final examination on the 16th, Datong started the final examination on the 20th, Guanghua started the final examination on the 23rd, Aurora and Daxia started the final examination on the 24th, China Business College started the final examination on the 26th, and most other schools also scheduled to finish the examination and start the holiday before the end of the year to end the academic program for this semester. The starting date for the next semester should be February 22 according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, and classes should start on the 29th or March 1. Now the presidents of the schools have decided to start school one week earlier on February 14, and classes will start on the 21st. The courses that are missing due to the early end of this semester will be made up in the next semester. However, there are also special cases, such as St. John's, which has decided to end this semester at the end of the month and start the academic program for the next semester one week after the holiday. Registration will be on January 6 and 7, and classes will start on the 10th. The tuition fee for the next semester will be calculated by multiplying 32 yuan by the cost of living index at the end of December this year, with 96 yuan for this semester as the base number, and will be paid in three installments. The tuition fees for the second and third installments will be calculated according to the cost of living index at the time of payment. Shanghai University will also decide based on St. John's affordability.

### A Word to Those Coming to Guangzhou from Other Provinces: Think Thrice Before Acting

— By Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong

[Guangzhou, 12th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The war along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers has brought Guangzhou into an even greater state of prosperity.

For the past month, a tide of people has been pouring into this important southern city from North and Central China, filling every available dwelling. From "necessary preparations" to "outsiders" wandering the streets, everything has become the most stimulating topic of conversation.

Guangzhou's urban area has approximately 180,000 houses, which were originally already perceived as extremely valuable, given the population of over 600,000. With the wave of evacuation, Cantonese people from East China are returning south, and "outsiders" from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are pouring in. With the difficulty of living in Hong Kong, Guangzhou naturally seems the most ideal. As a result, everyone is scrambling and competing, leading to high prices in bidding. Guangzhou landlords have also learned the benefits of "extra fees." A small Western-style house can command exorbitant sums, with three, five, or seven "extra fees" without worrying about anyone being unwilling to pay. Land prices have soared to unprecedented levels, with demands often made in Hong Kong dollars or gold. Consequently, many of those evacuating from other places and seeking a place to settle have returned in disappointment, unable to find even a foothold.

The difficulties in finding housing for newcomers caused by the evacuation wave, along with the alarming price levels akin to those in Beijing and Shanghai, have also followed the influx southward, posing a threat to residents' livelihoods. According to statistics from relevant departments, Guangzhou's current prices have risen by an average of over threefold in the past month, more than double those of Beijing and Shanghai. (The cost of public utilities is five times that of Shanghai). To accurately report the latest prices, one must write them down only at the post office counter. Therefore, those busy "fleeing the disaster" and coming south should think thrice before acting.

Due to the changing situation, Guangzhou's importance has undeniably been increasing. Chairman Song Ziwen's presence in the southern frontier and his recent hard work and busyness are beyond what outsiders can imagine. Even the appointment of a minor police chief is done personally, naturally to strengthen the overall security of South China. According to a recent announcement by the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, "Security in various parts of South China, after careful deployment, is now sufficient to deal with any sudden event." At the same time, dispatches were sent to all suppression zones to intensify the campaign to eliminate bandits in their respective jurisdictions, to ensure complete safety, and plans were made to recruit 200,000 soldiers next year to consolidate the region. A series of measures will solidify South China.

On the other hand, the development of resources is progressing alongside military affairs. With the official opening of Huangpu Port, the smooth flow of materials is gradually approaching the ideal. To enhance transportation efficiency, Chairman Song Ziwen recently allocated substantial funds, ordering the accelerated completion of the Huangpu branch line of the Yuehan Railway. When American aid arrives, it will be unloaded at Huangpu and transported to the war zones along the Yuehan Railway. The importance of its position is self-evident. At the same time, due to the southward relocation of factories and some institutions under the National Resources Commission, the center of import and export has shifted from Shanghai to the south, further promoting Guangzhou's industrial prosperity. Everything is progressing rapidly. With 40 million people diligently working together, Guangdong will undoubtedly be able to rekindle the revolutionary spirit and strength of the Northern Expedition era under the leadership of Chairman Song Ziwen!

### Sichuan Intensifies the Organization and Training of the Populace

[Chengdu, 10th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After the establishment of the Sichuan Self-Defense Committee, it was decided to convene a provincial conference of the populace to safeguard Sichuan, resist bandits, and save the country. The provincial council was tasked with drafting a plan to pacify Sichuan and defend against bandits. The entire population of Sichuan has begun mobilization and is implementing emergency measures step by step. Militarily, self-defense organization and training are being carried out, refining a militia of 2 million. A request has been made to the central government to allocate 100,000 self-defense rifles, and civilian firearms will be borrowed to expand the security forces by 16 regiments. In addition, five divisions of the Sichuan Army will be expanded, including two divisions of Sun Zhen, and one division each of Luo Guangwen, Yang Gancai, and Xiang Minzhi. There are also plans for another mobile self-defense corps of the populace. Politically, free expression will be encouraged, uniting the government and the public, thoroughly eradicating corruption, clarifying official governance, and mobilizing the populace. The government and the people will jointly form a new organization to suppress and defend Sichuan. Economically, a special self-defense levy will be collected, forcing those with money to contribute, and prices and materials will be comprehensively managed and controlled.

Self-defense organization and training are currently being carried out in various counties. According to the "Sichuan Province Populace Self-Defense Organization and Training Plan" drafted by the provincial government: (1) Each county and city will establish a populace self-defense organization and training headquarters, with the county magistrate concurrently serving as the commander, and a specially appointed deputy commander responsible for actual operations. A self-defense brigade will be established in each township, and a self-defense squad in each bao, with a three-tiered system of responsibility, all under the overall command of the provincial security headquarters. (2) The self-defense team will be based on the bao squad, with each bao drawing one to three able-bodied men from each jia to rotate training. (3) The principle of the self-defense team is to not be separated from production. Able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 will be organized. (4) The principle of "man not separated from gun, gun not separated from village" will be followed, with basic-level cadres selected by the squad themselves. It is expected that this organizational training work will be completed by next spring.

### Henan Students Wander Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line

— By Our Reporter Jiang Feng

[Jinhua, 12th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Thousands upon thousands of students have fled in a state of chaos from various cities in the Central Plains. They probably left in too much of a hurry, and other than what they could carry on their shoulders – a bedding roll and some scattered clothing – they left everything behind, heading southeast on their way. These refugee youths, with weary feet, are drifting along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line via the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Line.

On the special trains carrying refugee students westward along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, hundreds of students are packed into dilapidated carriages, often accompanied by the mournful tunes of Henan ballads.

The recently repaired Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is extremely poorly equipped, and the sudden burden of transporting refugee students is proving to be somewhat overwhelming. Therefore, except for the one or two express trains that manage to operate as usual, the bottoms of all other passenger and freight trains (numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 41, and 42) have been entirely converted for the evacuation of refugee students since the ninth of last month. In just the short half-month from the tenth to the twenty-fifth of last month, a total of over 20,000 refugee students from a dozen or so schools, including Henan Yuzhang, Zhengzhong, Zheng Gong, Kaizhong, Kaishi, Jizhong, Yanzhong, Shangzhong, Xuzhong, and Zhongzheng, have been evacuated.

The reporter recently visited the Xuchang Normal School, Yuhua United Middle School, and Heyue United Middle School in Lanxi, Jinhua, and Quzhou, respectively. The students' miserable situation and the schools' difficult circumstances are the same in all three schools. Except for Heyue United Middle School, where Director Tang Enbo of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters helped to build thatched huts, most are cramped in ancestral halls and temples, sleeping on the ground. During the day, they take out the only one or two books they have and stand in the wilderness to read. At night, two or three people share a thin blanket, huddled together on the dirt floor. Now, as it is early winter, many students are so poor that they don't even have cotton-padded clothes, and they resist the cold wind with their bodies. They are all enduring the refugee life with great patience and hardship.

### Guizhou Plans to Increase Production and Develop Weining Caohai

— By Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Guiyang, 11th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Guizhou is located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with many mountains and little water. Although rivers such as the Wujiang and Nanpanjiang flow through the province, they are impeded by towering mountains and steep cliffs, lacking both convenient navigation and irrigation. Moreover, floods often occur in summer and autumn, causing disasters and hardship for the residents along the rivers. In recent years, those who study hydraulic engineering have been searching for the secrets of the mountains and rivers to develop hidden resources, either by utilizing the water level difference to build power generation projects, or by draining accumulated water from deep pools to develop farmland irrigation, rectifying deviations and saving the drought-stricken, which greatly benefits the prosperity of the rural economy. Since assuming office this summer, Guizhou Provincial Chairman Gu Zhenglun has made "developing ground resources" the main theme of construction, and has been making unremitting efforts to build farmland water conservancy and increase food production. Recently, the provincial government standing committee approved the development of over 60,000 mu of land in the Weining Caohai area in the northwest of the province, a water conservancy project covering a total drainage area of 380 square kilometers. It advanced the full cost of the surveying team from October to December of this year, which is a good policy for striving to build the rear and supporting the front's pacification efforts. Therefore, I will report on the various aspects of the Caohai development in summary to benefit readers who are concerned about rear area construction.

The Flooding of Caohai

Caohai is located west of Weining County in the northwest of Guizhou Province. According to the county chronicles, the area was originally a vast plain, with three rivers formed by the convergence of water from the four mountains, flowing through it and dividing into the deep water pool that eliminates water in front of the Dragon King Temple near Jiangjiawan across from Yangguan Mountain, and into dozens of dry caves in the Ao River. In the twenty-seventh year of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, continuous rain and mountain floods broke out, with surging waves carrying sand and rocks, destroying and blocking all the holes that eliminated water, causing the drainage to be ineffective, the plain to be submerged, and the land to sink. The water flowed and swirled, gradually forming a "sea," with an area of approximately 45 square kilometers, equivalent to more than 67,500 mu. The loss of good farmland was once submerged by water, and the loss was terrible.

Early Surveying

In the eighteenth year of the Guangxu Emperor, General Su Yuanrui once dug a drainage ditch to lead the accumulated water into the Black Rock Cave, but the work was suspended due to Su's departure. Although the effect was not significant, the water level was slightly lowered. In June of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the county magistrate of the county, Zhou Fushi, requested the provincial government to send a team to survey the area. The former Guizhou Provincial Farmland Water Conservancy Loan Committee organized the "Caohai Survey Team" in October of that year, sending personnel to lead the team to conduct a preliminary survey. However, its purpose was to focus on understanding whether the drainage design was possible, so it only surveyed the terrain in the area from the bridge to the Black Rock Cave, without covering the entire Caohai area. It took two months to get a rough idea.

Interruption of the Project

According to the drainage plan formulated by the Farmland Loan Committee survey team based on the preliminary survey results at that time, the area of Caohai was 45 square kilometers, the drainage area of Caohai was 180 square kilometers, in addition, another river flowed into Caohai, and the drainage area of the river was 200 square kilometers, so the total drainage area of Caohai was actually 380 square kilometers, its water level was 98.14 meters (assuming the height of the benchmark was 100 meters, set on the foundation of the Li family house on the west side of the bridge), the deepest height of the seabed was 94.34 meters (the height of the ordinary seabed was mostly 96 meters), assuming that it could be drained in five days, the drainage volume was 250 cubic meters per second, which was the number required at the beginning of the drainage period. Once the drainage canal was completed, the water level would drop, and the subsequent drainage volume could be reduced to one-fifth of the above number, which was 50 cubic meters per second, which was the drainage volume estimated based on the existing volume of Caohai. Based on this estimate, the team designed the Caohai drainage project, which was divided into two parts: the first part was to drain the accumulated water, and the second part was to build canals to irrigate farmland. In addition, it may be possible to use a tunnel to drain water and generate 600 kilowatts of electricity to promote the rural industry in the vicinity. According to the budget prepared in August of the 32nd year of the Republic of China according to this project plan, approximately 70,654,000 yuan in legal tender was required for the project cost. Later, because the Agricultural Bank of China did not approve the loan, and because Guizhou was invaded by the enemy in the south, the overall situation was greatly affected, and this project was suspended again.

Suspension Again

Later, the Weining County government felt that the project was of great importance to local interests, so in May of the 33rd year, it convened a meeting of local gentry to decide to plan and implement it by itself, to be completed in five years. The part of the project was decided to be built by collecting labor, and the stone work part was to be funded by raising funds, but because the local revenue was insufficient and the financial resources were limited, it still insisted on requesting the Agricultural Bank of China to loan 10 million yuan in legal tender each year as a subsidy, but it was not recognized by the Agricultural Bank of China, and the project was suspended again, causing this vast plain of 45 square kilometers to be abandoned, which was a pity.

Revitalizing Water Conservancy

Chairman Gu Zhenglun patrolled the counties in the northwest of the province last month. After passing through Weining and returning to the province, he witnessed the hardship of the counties in the northwest of the province, where agricultural production was not abundant and it was difficult to be self-sufficient. He felt very regretful, believing that the only way to relieve the local rural areas was to reclaim wasteland, build water conservancy, and increase food production. He ordered the Guizhou Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau to plan and implement the Weining Caohai drainage project to restore the past farmland and increase food production, and to facilitate the development of the area after the Xukun Railway and Xiangqian Railway are connected in the county in the future. The maps, reports, and various records obtained by the Farmland Loan Committee survey team that day were either simple due to the loss of focus, or were lost due to years of disrepair. At present, if we want to talk about development, we must ask the central government for money. To ask for money, we need budgets, plans, survey maps, and other things that are indispensable. The Water Conservancy Bureau had no choice but to go back and repeat the survey again.

Survey Report

Recently, according to the preliminary report from the head of the second section of the bureau and the head of the survey team, Jiang Yunxin, and the survey team of eight people who arrived at Caohai and surveyed for more than half a month, the water level of Caohai has undergone major changes in recent years, with the deepest point being no more than six or seven meters, and the shallowest point being only about one meter. It is the shallowest "sea" seen in the interior of our country. In the shallow and clear part, the old paths can still be clearly seen. Once the water flow is discharged, there is no doubt that cultivation can be restored. The surveying work is still actively progressing in the cold weather, and it will be fully completed by the end of February next year. According to Water Conservancy Bureau Director Zhang Hongchang, once the surveying work is completed and the maps and records are compiled, a detailed project plan will be prepared and sent to the central government for inclusion in the budget, and it is hoped that it can be allocated as soon as possible, hoping that construction can be prepared in the spring of next year, so that the food problem in the northwest of Guizhou next year can be largely resolved, and the song of "Farmer's Joy" can then be broadcast with a smile from the mouths of the frowning and worried poor farmers.

### Hong Kong Military and Police Grand Exercise Ends; Grantham Sternly Warns the Communists

— By Our Special Correspondent Zijian

[Hong Kong, 12th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] "We cannot compromise with communism. One cannot compromise with the devil… They interfere with our way of life, therefore we must firmly resist. Since the Fascist Devil was destroyed, we are now facing another demon, namely Communism. In its total disregard for the human soul, it is as bad as Fascist tyranny…"

This was a speech given by Hong Kong Governor Grantham on the evening of the 9th at Morrison Hall of the University of Hong Kong after Hong Kong's first major post-war military and police exercise (see the 10th Industrial and Commercial Evening News). The Governor's statement at this time that "Do not compromise with the Communists" has attracted considerable attention here. As far as we remember, the Governor visited General MacArthur last month, and then went south to Singapore to hold a conference of British territories in Southeast Asia. The Governor, who usually lives quietly next to a park in Hong Kong, now seems to be busy. In this speech, in addition to condemning the wrongdoings of communism, the Governor also issued a stern warning to the rampant Communists. He said: "Communists must understand that if we peace-loving people are attacked, we will resist, and at the same time we must not deceive ourselves, nor can we be deceived by others."

Is this speech by the Governor aimed at the Communists in Hong Kong?

Another Exercise

The Hong Kong military and police grand exercise, which lasted for four days, was officially announced to be over at 9:00 am on the 9th. British Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Alexander said that the results of the exercise were "fairly satisfactory." Alexander revealed that the British Army authorities are preparing to hold another exercise of the same nature in February next year.

Reuters reported from London on the 8th that British Defense Minister Alexander said in the Lower House on the 8th that in view of the advance of the Communists, attention has been continuously paid to security measures in Hong Kong. British Colonial Undersecretary Winnis also said that the government has taken all possible steps to prevent Hong Kong's population from being overly crowded and chaotic. It seems that the situation in Hong Kong has now been noticed by the gentlemen in London.

After this telegram was sent out, the English-language South China Morning Post on the 10th reported on the security of Hong Kong under the headline, reporting that the Gurkha Rifles, which are now protecting rubber plantations and tin mines in Singapore against the Malayan Communist guerrillas, will be transferred to Hong Kong by the end of this year to increase defense. The Gurkha Rifles are a type of Indian soldier, tall and strong, known for their bravery and skill in battle. Most of the Gurkha people live near Nepal on the Sino-Indian border. They have long been recruited by the British to be the main force protecting British interests, and they have done a lot for Britain in both World Wars. Now they are coming to Hong Kong again, regardless of the long distance.

A cartoon recently published in a local newspaper depicts a wealthy man who has just arrived from Shanghai, who is taken aback when he sees the British army exercise. If this wealthy man had read this reporter's report, he might have simply wanted to turn back from Hong Kong.

### Local Raw Cotton Has Entered the Market in Large Quantities; The Joint Purchasing Association Strengthens Collection and Storage; The Routine Meeting Yesterday Decided to Increase Funds by 200 Million Yuan Again

[Our Newspaper] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee held a routine meeting yesterday. After discussion, it was decided that local raw cotton has entered the market in large quantities to enrich the raw cotton inventory and adjust rural finance. It was decided to increase financial assistance again and launch a comprehensive purchasing operation. As a result, it was decided to increase cotton purchase funds by 200 million yuan again, to be borne equally by the Central Bank and the China Textile Construction Corporation. According to the original amount of cotton purchase funds of about 200 million yuan, 200 million yuan was increased at the routine meeting last week. Including the funds increased this week, the total amount of cotton purchase funds has reached 600 million yuan. All funds will be allocated this month.

Since the association launched the cotton collection, it has now collected 220,000 dan, and there should be no problem in collecting 500,000 dan by the end of this month. According to the current situation, just in Hankou, as long as there are sufficient funds, there is no problem in collecting 10,000 dan per day.

In addition, 12,000 pieces of yarn previously paid by private factories are priced at 789 yuan per piece according to the limited price. Now the Central Bank is purchasing it and giving a subsidy of 6,500 yuan per piece, for a total price of more than 50 million yuan.

[Another Dispatch] As of now, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee has collected more than 200,000 dan of cotton. Most of the above cotton is allocated to the National Bank and the Textile Construction Corporation, and a small amount is allocated to private yarn factories. The reason is that very few private factories participate in the joint purchasing business. Although there are one or two, they have not paid the second batch of working capital, so they did not go to pick up the quota they received. It is also learned that recently, the cotton collection agencies in various places of the Joint Purchasing Association have been very prosperous. Farmers in the Shanghai and Hankou districts have been very enthusiastic about selling their cotton. Since the war situation has been tense, most private factories have not launched cotton collection work, and even their business policies are mostly uncertain. Furthermore, many of the important responsible persons of the factories have left Shanghai, so the cotton collection work has turned cold. This situation may affect the supply of raw materials for the cotton spinning industry next year, so the Joint Purchasing Association intends to seize the time to increase the storage of local cotton, and will discuss with the National Bank and the Textile Construction Corporation to allocate more funds so that it can be purchased as much as possible during the peak season.

### Exchange of Gold Principles Remain Unchanged; Technical Improvements Await the Announcement of New Measures by the Central Bank; Authorities Deny Reduction of Exchange Quota

According to Mr. Li Xiaozhuang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, in an interview with a reporter, recent rumors that restrictions would soon be placed on the exchange of gold and silver for deposits, limiting each person to two taels of gold and twenty yuan of silver, are completely untrue. Yesterday (the 14th), the exchange limit for gold was still ten taels, and for silver dollars, it remained at the previous amount of forty-nine yuan. As for whether the number of application forms issued daily would be increased to encourage the recall of currency, the Central Bank has not made any decision. The bank is currently awaiting the announcement of the new measures for the exchange of gold and silver by the Ministry of Finance.

New Measures for Gold Exchange Include Three Principles

According to sources within the new financial management authorities, the new law regarding the exchange of gold and silver for deposits contains three principles:

(1) Preventing "scalpers" and "powerful individuals" from monopolizing the exchange. (2) Ensuring that all people have the opportunity to exchange. (3) Limiting the amount of exchange to avoid large-scale arbitrage by a small number of wealthy individuals and to prevent a repeat of the past policy of selling gold.

The source also stated that the Ministry of Finance has already formulated detailed measures based on these principles, which will be formally announced in the coming days. As for rumors that the government's gold reserves are depleted due to the recent rush to exchange gold, this is absolutely inaccurate. Although the number of people exchanging gold and silver in various places has increased in recent days, the amount exchanged is not large. Therefore, the government will definitely continue to manage the exchange of gold and silver in accordance with its established policy.

### Gold Shops Request Gold Allocation; Will Petition the Central Bank Again

Local gold shops have repeatedly requested the Central Bank to allocate gold at the exchange rate to solve the problem of the source of gold ornaments. At that time, the Central Bank authorities agreed to consider the matter further. It is now learned that because the Central Bank has not yet given a formal reply to this issue, the gold shops will petition the Central Bank again in the coming days, requesting permission to allocate gold to maintain their business.

### Half of This Year's Winter Farming Loans Approved

According to related sources, the authorities have decided to approve half of the ten million yuan in winter farming loans from the Central Farmers Bank. The Shanghai branch's original quota of 644,000 yuan has reportedly been approved for a 50% disbursement by the Central Bank, totaling 322,000 yuan. However, according to the person in charge of the Farmers Bank, formal approval has not yet been received. As soon as the approval is issued, the loan approval process will begin.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates and Overseas Remittances Both Rose Yesterday

The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates rose significantly yesterday. The initial price was 48.5 yuan for buying, then 49.5 yuan, and finally 50.5 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The exchange rate for overseas remittances at the Bank of China was raised to 50 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan.

### Planned Capital Increase of Banks and Financial Institutions to be Deposited; Amount Estimated at Approximately 60 Million Yuan

[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Finance previously decided to extend the deadline for commercial banks and financial institutions to deposit their increased capital at the Central Bank to the end of this month. However, to date, none of the banks and financial institutions have applied to the Central Bank. According to the Central Bank, banks and financial institutions in other cities have generally completed the process. Although banks and financial institutions in this city have not applied to the Central Bank for deposit, most of the capital increase work has been completed. It is expected that the entire process will be completed within the next half month. It is estimated that the amount of increased capital to be deposited is approximately 60 million gold yuan. Although the money supply in this city has recently become loose, the market situation is expected to return to normal once the banks and financial institutions complete the deposit process.

### Canned Food Industry; Sales Decreasing Daily

According to the Industrial Association, the situation of the canned food industry is as follows: In 1914, only Taikang Company had a factory producing bread, biscuits, and canned food. In 1918, Guanshengyuan Factory was established, manufacturing various pastries and canned foods, and together with Taikang Company, they were known as the two giants of the food industry. In 1933, the Merlin Canning Factory was established, mainly producing canned goods. Later, factories such as Weida, Jimei, Rusheng, and Kailin were established one after another. There are a total of 16 factories of various sizes in this city, with 1,074 workers. The equipment includes 112 can-making machines, 12 punch presses, 374 foot-operated punch presses, 7 shear cars, 26 steaming tanks, 15 cooking pots, 9 vacuum pumps, 2 egg beaters, 1 orange peel car, 20 lid-making machines, 4 green bean shelling machines, 3 bean sorting machines, 8 tomato machines, 9 crushing and grinding machines, 21 candy machines, 2 sets of soda equipment, and 2 sets of automatic biscuit-making machines. The annual output of products includes 310,000 boxes of various canned foods, 25,000 boxes of various bottled condiments, 130,000 tins of biscuits, 360,000 jin of bulk biscuits, 3,600 boxes of Huadiao wine, 5.5 million pieces of bread and pastries, and 200,000 dozen of soda, fresh orange juice, and fruit syrup. Most of the raw materials used are domestic products. Only 40,000 boxes of tinplate, 8,000 reams of copperplate paper and cellophane, 120 tons of fuel oil, and a portion of chemical raw materials are imported from abroad. However, recently, domestic wages and prices have risen sharply, making it difficult to export products. Exports are only half of what they used to be. Due to inconvenient transportation, sales in northern and inland China have decreased significantly. In this city, due to the weak purchasing power of the people, there is an oversupply in the market. The daily expenses of factories have increased dramatically, so many are reducing their workforce.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Rise; Cotton Cloth Prices Fluctuate Slightly Higher

Yesterday, cotton yarn prices started flat and ended strong. The money supply remained loose, and there were still many buyers in the market. However, those holding goods, believing that prices had reached their peak, were considering selling, so supply and demand were still balanced. As a result, the prices of all yarns were still slightly higher than the previous day.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 16,500 yuan and closed at 17,500 yuan, an increase of 1,700 yuan. Other yarns, such as Baoguang and Jincheng, also rose by about 1,500 yuan.

32-count Silver Moon rose by 400 yuan and closed at 15,200 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 14,000 yuan, then fell to 13,800 yuan, but finally rebounded to 14,600 yuan, an increase of 400 yuan.

20-count Double Horse rose from 12,000 yuan to 12,300 yuan, an increase of 600 yuan. 16-count Guangming and 10-count Boy Scout yarns were both close to the 10,000 yuan mark, at 9,500 yuan. Other yarns also ended firmly.

Cotton cloth trading was sparse. Buyers, anticipating further price increases, mostly remained on the sidelines. Northern merchants continued to sell at high prices. The market opened firm in the morning, but prices fell before rebounding, and finally saw slight progress.

Longtou fine cloth opened at 535 yuan, then fell to 515 yuan. At one point, due to support from the floor traders, it rose to the highest price of 555 yuan from the previous day. The noon close was 540 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan. Laba Tong fine cloth alone fell by 15 yuan. Junzi Yuan drill opened at 530 yuan, reached a high of 555 yuan, and closed at 545 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu Yuan drill also rose by about 10 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong rose by 15 yuan and closed at 565 yuan. Tiao Li Yuan Guang oblique remained unchanged at 320 yuan. Other colored cloths and printed cloths also showed improvement.

China Textile Distribution

Due to price fluctuations, the market was quite receptive. China Textile's distribution yesterday was also very strong. A total of 14,320 bolts of various colored cloths, 880 yuan of bedsheets, and 12,000 pounds of remnants were sold, bringing in a total of 7,663,400 yuan in gold yuan. The prices were: Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong Ne 555 yuan, Sijunzi Biji 535 yuan, Tiao Li Changqing Biji 500 yuan, Tiao   Hui Guang Xie 290 yuan, Tiao   Handkerchief Cloth 480 yuan, Sijunzi Hua Biji 490 yuan, Second-Grade Hua Gong Ne 440 yuan, Second-Grade Hua Biji 440 yuan, Lion Furnace Sailcloth 660 yuan, Da Ling Extra Fine Cloth 360 yuan, Da Ling Extra Fine Oblique 360 yuan.

### Tea Market Trend is Strong

[Reported by this newspaper] According to tea industry authorities, export tea merchants, seeing that costs have increased sharply and that foreign exchange transfer certificates are conducive to exports, and also because of the recent loose money supply and low market interest rates (only 14-15 yuan per thousand yuan for daily discounts), may be inclined to hold on to their goods and are unwilling to sell them at a loss. Therefore, although export purchases by Xiehe and Yihua are strong, it is difficult to achieve their desired results, and transactions remain sluggish, but the underlying trend is exceptionally strong.

Domestic sales of tea in areas such as Benjie are in high demand, but the prices of goods also change rapidly, so the trend remains active and colorful.

### Tung Oil Base Firm

Since the sharp increase the day before yesterday, the tung oil trend remained strong yesterday. This is mainly because of the recent influx of capital from North China, which has loosened the money supply in the market, and daily discount interest rates have fallen. Therefore, holders of goods, seeing that borrowing is easy, are trying to hold on to their goods, so the situation is stable and the base is firm.

### Prices at Production Areas Fall; Rice Market Slightly Weak; Flour and Coarse Grains Turn Downward; Edible Oil Hovers

The rice market saw a slight decline because prices in Wuxi fell the previous day, so sentiment was very weak. In addition, there was a large arrival of goods, and with owners eagerly seeking to sell, prices finally declined by 10 yuan. In the South Market, white japonica rice and thin rice were both priced at 365 yuan, each 10 yuan lower than the previous day. Early rice fell by 15 yuan. Zhangyan early rice opened at 350 yuan, and indica rice fell by 5 yuan. Prices in the North Market remained firm. White japonica early rice maintained the original price, and thin rice and sheep indica each increased by 5 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan each rose by 10 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals were 4,502 shi in the South Market and 7,814 shi in the North Market.

Flour

Stopped rising and turned downward because the increase the previous day was too large, and actual sales were slow. In addition, those intending to trade took the opportunity to sell. Tianjin merchants sold a lot of Lao Che flour, opening at 160 yuan, then falling to 153 yuan, a decrease of 9 yuan from the previous day. Bingchuan flour closed at 150 yuan, a decrease of 4 yuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng were priced at 138-139 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour also fell by 5-6 yuan. Bran also declined, with large bags falling by 5 yuan.

Coarse Grains

Mostly weakened, but soybeans rose because Shantou merchants bought them. Zhadou closed at 190 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan. Corn purchases by merchant groups decreased, falling by 10-15 yuan. Red sorghum from inland areas became slow to move, falling by 5-10 yuan. Mung beans were actively sold by vermicelli factories, rising by 10-20 yuan. Jianqing sales were sluggish, falling by 10 yuan. Sesame also fell slightly by 20 yuan. Raw peanuts fell slightly by 10 yuan.

Edible Oil

Prices hovered at a high point. The initial market showed signs of weakness, but later became firm because oil factories did not open. Soybean oil's highest price was 1,070 yuan, closing at 1,050 yuan, a slight increase of 10 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 950 yuan, up 20 yuan. Raw oil did not rise enough the previous day, so yesterday Jitong raw oil rose by 100 yuan, to 1,150 yuan. Small cart sesame oil rose by 90 yuan. Soybean cake rose by 3-4 yuan.

### Silk Fabrics Fluctuate

Yesterday, the silk market went high then fluctuated, with a stable trend. After the opening of various stalls, there was active trading in the market, and sentiment was calm. The close was slightly higher by 200-300 yuan.

120-count Tianqiao initially opened at 15,400 yuan, and Dongyang at 15,600 yuan. After the opening, it was heard that the trends of various external goods were flat. The floor traders did not intend to raise prices. The holders also took the opportunity to settle. The silk weaving industry still had strong demand, so the market saw little fluctuation. It was slightly better by 200 yuan near the close.

The raw silk market also had a flat trend yesterday. There was a loose money supply in the industry. Various external goods did not fluctuate. Foreign firms' purchases were sluggish. The silk weaving industry's interest was weak. Holders also had ample funds and were reluctant to sell. Sentiment was mostly wait-and-see. There were few transactions at various grades.

The silk satin market first rose and then softened yesterday. Sentiment was quite firm at the initial opening, and prices rose straight up. In the middle, retail sellers kept selling, and sales to customers were not smooth, so prices went down again. Huaqiang bedspreads and Meiya bedspreads opened at 10,800 yuan and 11,000 yuan, respectively. After the opening, there were long calls for bids, but no transactions were heard, and sentiment suddenly softened. Floating sellers took the opportunity to settle, and prices fell back by 500 yuan. Finally, the market entered a stalemate. Near the close, Meiya settled at 10,600 yuan, and Huaqiang at 10,400 yuan.

### Remittance Income Decreases, Ministry of Finance Seeks Ways to Encourage Inward Flow

[Our Newspaper's Report] It is understood that since the authorities adopted the new method of releasing the exchange rate daily, our country's remittance income has improved compared to the past. However, due to the turbulent situation and the lack of security for domestic investment, the income is still not as large as expected. September saw the best remittance income situation after the currency reform, with stable prices. Since October, the handling banks have been submitting monthly remittance figures to the Ministry of Finance, and no longer making them public. Recently, due to the unrest situation, the flow of domestic capital to the Philippines has had a considerable impact on our country's remittance income, because at one point after the currency reform, remittances from the Philippines ranked first in our country's overall remittances. In the current situation, remittances from the Philippines are bound to have a significant reduction.

[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance: Regarding the government's absorption of remittances, the situation has improved in recent months since the revision of the methods. As for how to guide overseas Chinese capital to import equipment and materials, in addition to striving to simplify procedures and relax restrictions, the government has also formulated other incentive measures for overseas Chinese investment in the country to encourage them. If overseas Chinese are not familiar with the procedures for importing, they can also entrust the Central Trust Bureau to handle import matters on their behalf. Detailed methods are being studied and drafted by the Export-Import Management Committee.
