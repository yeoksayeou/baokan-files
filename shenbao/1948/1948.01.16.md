### British Envoy and Foreign Minister Wang Confer Earnestly, Kowloon City Case Expected to Be Resolved; Supervisory Committee Suggests Government Retake Hong Kong and Kowloon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the Kowloon City issue, British Ambassador Stevenson and Foreign Minister Wang conferred earnestly again on the evening of the 15th. It is heard that both sides' opinions are nearing agreement, and under the condition of maintaining China's position, this matter is expected to find a reasonable solution.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] There were no major developments in the Kowloon City incident on the 15th. The British Embassy has still not received any instructions from London. Yin Baoyu, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received Lei Boji, Counselor of the British Embassy, at 11 am to discuss various issues related to the Kowloon City incident again. Yin made a serious request to Lei regarding the Hong Kong court overstepping its authority in sentencing Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu, representatives of the arrested residents of Kowloon City, to hard labor, earnestly requesting the British to release the two residents and urging the British side to quickly accept the various demands previously made by Foreign Minister Wang to Ambassador Stevenson in order to maintain friendly Sino-British relations. Regarding the issue of jurisdiction over Kowloon City, Lei still maintained his original intention, but for the sake of Sino-British friendship, he agreed to forward our demands to the British Ambassador for immediate communication to the London government.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Supervisory Yuan held a discussion meeting of supervisory committee members at 10 am on the 15th to discuss the Kowloon City incident. After the meeting, supervisory committee members He Hanwen, Yu Fen, Huang Fengchi, Yu Shude, Mei Gongren, and 23 others jointly proposed a motion for "Retaking Hong Kong and Kowloon by a Set Date." The original text is as follows: "In the late Qing Dynasty, politics were corrupt, and the great powers took advantage of the danger, successively invading and occupying our country's territory and sovereignty. After the Opium War, Britain forced us to cede Hong Kong. On June 9, 1898, it further forced us to lease Kowloon in order to extend the ruling scope of Hong Kong and its aggressive forces towards South China. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, with our country's eight years of heroic struggle, the international status increased, and countries showed deep sympathy to China. They all successively and automatically abolished various unequal treaties signed with China over the past century, and all concessions and leased territories were successively taken back. However, Britain, limited by the interests of its colonies, has not agreed to return Hong Kong, which was seized by aggressive means, and Kowloon, which was forcibly leased, despite repeated reasonable negotiations by our country. Recently, it has become even more intensified. The Hong Kong government authorities have even ordered the Chinese residents of the old city of Kowloon to demolish their houses. On the 5th of this month, the Hong Kong and Kowloon police armed themselves and entered Kowloon City outside the leased territory to forcibly demolish houses and arrest resident representatives, arbitrarily sentencing them to hard labor. On the morning of the 12th, they brazenly shot at Chinese residents, causing public outrage. Our country's government diplomatic authorities have also lodged a serious protest with the British government. The 1898 Sino-British lease treaty regarding the Kowloon Peninsula stipulates that the leased territory is for a period of ninety-nine years, under British jurisdiction, but the Kowloon City area is still the complete territory of China and is not included in the lease. Chinese officials can still perform their duties in the city, residents can still continue to reside and do business, and Chinese warships can still use the waters of Dapeng and Shenzhen. This time, Britain's brutality in Kowloon not only violates the lease treaty but is also a new action of aggression against Chinese sovereignty. Moreover, due to the existence of Hong Kong and the Kowloon leased territory, various illegal elements and groups resisting the government rely on it, and all smuggling uses Hong Kong and Kowloon as a base of operations, and the Hong Kong government also secretly protects them. Considering the facts, since the British government seized Hong Kong and Kowloon by aggressive means in the first place, and now treats our residents with violence, our country's government should re-determine its countermeasures. Since all unequal treaties suffered by our country after the war have been abolished one after another, the remaining poison of the seizure of Hong Kong and the forced lease of Kowloon cannot be allowed to continue to exist. The committee members respectfully suggest in accordance with the law that the government should immediately take effective measures to retake Hong Kong, abolish the Sino-British Kowloon Peninsula lease treaty, retake the Kowloon Peninsula, and demand that the British government compensate our residents for all losses suffered due to this illegal action. If Britain continues to have the same situation as before, our government should protect the residents with force on the one hand and conduct tough negotiations on the other." (Other news about the Kowloon incident is published in another column.)

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Xu Chuanlin, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, commented on the Hong Kong government's action of ordering Chinese residents to withdraw from Kowloon City on the 15th, calling it a disgrace to the British. He suggested that the government sever traffic with Hong Kong for three months as a protest. A spokesman for the Youth Party pointed out that Hong Kong is a remnant of imperialism and demanded that the government retake sovereignty over the island.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 15th] The bandit troops of Chen Geng and Liu Bocheng, who have been roaming in southern Henan and northern Hubei, have continued to launch fierce attacks on Deng County in recent days. The Air Force here has been constantly dispatched to inflict heavy blows on them. The bandit crowds entrenched in various villages on the outskirts of Deng County have suffered heavy casualties from our Air Force's day-long bombing and strafing. Most of the fortifications they built have also been destroyed, and the bandit army's offensive has apparently been shattered by the intense pressure exerted by our Air Force.

Editorial

### The Military Focus is in the North

Since the Lunar New Year, the wars in the Northeast and North China have not eased due to the cold weather. Instead, the communist bandits have intensified their attacks in the icy and snowy conditions. In the Northeast, the communist bandits launched their seventh offensive against Shenyang, coming on fiercely. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers, in the line of Zhangwu and Xinlitun in western Liaoning, defeated the right wing of the communist bandits, turning their seventh offensive into a bubble. Although the war has been quieter in the past few days, it still presents a situation of outward expansion and inner tension. The main force of the communist bandits is currently shifting from the triangular area of ​​Xi'an, Meihekou, and Qingyuan to Faku, Xinmin, and other places, attempting to threaten the Beining Railway, thereby besieging Shenyang. In North China, the flames of war once spread to the outskirts of Tianjin, and Xiaozhan, an important stronghold in its southeast, was once infiltrated by the communist bandits. The communist bandits also attempted to take advantage of the situation to harass Tanggu, but after three days and nights of hard fighting by the National Army, Xiaozhan was finally recovered, removing the threat to the outskirts of Tianjin. However, the communist bandits' ambition to harass has not died, and they are still making trouble there, so the crisis in North China has not really been eliminated. Although we are unwilling to deny the seriousness of the situation, we have not lost our confidence in suppressing the bandits and quelling the chaos.

Chairman Chiang flew to Beiping and then to Shenyang on the 10th of this month, and it is hoped that the war situation in the Northeast and North China will stabilize in the shortest possible time. Moreover, military actions to suppress bandits and quell chaos must advance without retreat. From a national perspective, the recent convening of the Army Training Conference, presided over by Chairman Chiang himself, has decided to divide the country into eight new recruit training centers, with Beiping and Shenyang being two of the eight centers. If we look at the Northeast and North China, the saying that the Generalissimo Headquarters will move to Beiping has been clamoring in recent days. Moreover, in order to ensure the transportation on the Beining Railway and eliminate the communist bandits in the border area of ​​Hebei, Rehe, and Liaoning, the National Army has decided to set up a command structure in western Liaoning, with General Fan Hanjie in charge. Therefore, Chu Xichun, the newly appointed Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, recently stated: "The National Army will never give up Changji, and the Beining Railway will soon be opened." These two sentences are definitely not empty words, and facts can prove this in the near future.

Looking around the national war situation, the current military focus is still in the North (including the Northeast and North China). I remember that in the spring of last year, the communist bandits had the arrogant ambition to "ensure the Northeast, consolidate North China, and develop Central China." For a year, the troops of the communist bandits Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, and Chen Yi have been scurrying east and west in Central China, attempting to implement their so-called "conspiracy to develop Central China." Everyone knows that Central China is the heart of the government. If it becomes a bandit's roaming area, the entire situation will be extremely serious. However, since the establishment of the Jiujiang Command Post of the Ministry of National Defense, the military affairs of Central China have been assigned to General Bai Chongxi to be responsible for commanding them, and therefore all difficulties have been overcome. Recently, because the communist bandits' plan to roam failed, they vented their anger on the United States and even massacred American female missionaries. From this point alone, it can be seen that the troops of Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, and Chen Yi are certainly more than capable of killing ordinary people while running east and west, but they will never succeed in developing Central China. Therefore, we believe that the military focus today is still in the North, and we want to ask readers to pay close attention to the development of the war situation in the North. We must also know that the gains and losses of the military to suppress the bandits in the North are too important to the future of the entire effort to quell the chaos and build the country. Some defeatists create rumors of abandoning the Northeast, which are not worth readers laughing at.

Recently, the Central Government has issued a general order to the troops to pay attention to and value economic strongholds. This is indeed the most valuable instruction in the work of quelling the chaos. The strategy adopted by the communist bandits since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War can be summed up in one sentence, which is the four words "calling troops to rebel." In addition to expanding their territory by force, they also want to destroy domestic transportation, causing the country's production to stagnate, thereby promoting the collapse of the government in financial and economic aspects. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall came to China to mediate, and in less than a month, he saw through the communist bandits' conspiracy to drag down the government by means of war. Therefore, for the government, the only fundamental way to suppress bandits and quell chaos lies in military and economic aspects, working together and complementing each other, so that it can achieve twice the result with half the effort. It can even be said that economic quelling of chaos is more important than military affairs. We have read the government's recent instructions and can be more confident and justified.

Based on this, the economic value of the North, such as the soybeans of the Northeast, the coal mines of Beiping and Tianjin, the cotton of Shijiazhuang, the tobacco leaves of Xuchang, and the wheat of Shandong, are all important materials for the national economy and people's livelihood. The National Army must pay attention to striving for them. The reason why the communist bandits want to "ensure the Northeast and consolidate North China" is also based on this. Therefore, the National Army must implement the purpose of this instruction in the future. Only in this way do we expect that the war in the North in the next month or two will be a war to compete for cotton. According to experts' estimates, the cotton harvest in the North last autumn may be 12 million dan, of which only one-third has been purchased by the government, and the remaining two-thirds are still waiting to be snapped up. This depends on the coordination of military power, which goes without saying.

In short, we observe the evolution of the national situation and have to call on the whole country to step up the work of suppressing bandits and quelling chaos. In the current stage, on the one hand, the National Army must pay attention to the North. The Northeast and North China are our lifeline, and we must never give them up lightly. To be honest, without the Northeast, there is no North China; without North China, there is no Central China. We must never be defeatists and want to be content with temporary peace. On the other hand, we must also face the crisis in Central China. The Jiang, Huai, He, and Han are indeed a vast plain, but there are also many mountains in Dabie, Dahong, Tongbai, and Wudang, which can be used as bandit hideouts. At present, we should take advantage of the communist bandits' unstable foothold in Central China to give them a head-on blow. On the active side, we should encircle and annihilate the communist bandits; on the passive side, we should at least consolidate the river defense and strictly guard the Sichuan border, so as to prevent the communist bandits from realizing their delusion of crossing the river or entering Sichuan to expand the scope of the roaming army.

### Students in Beijing Jointly Petition, Urging the Government to Resolutely Protect Rights; Gan Naiguang Says Recovering Hong Kong and Kowloon is a Matter of Time

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Twelve units of colleges and universities in the capital, including National Chengchi University, have formed a student petition delegation to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon, and dispatched more than 50 representatives to petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Executive Yuan on the afternoon of the 15th.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Gan Naiguang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, made important remarks on the issue of recovering Hong Kong and Kowloon when he met with representatives of the Beijing student petition on the afternoon of the 15th. He said that the National Government is a revolutionary government, and has been doing its best for 36 years to remove the shackles of unequal treaties. In the early days of 1943, most of the various unequal international obligations had been abolished, and the right to recover the remaining Kowloon was declared. The complete removal of unequal shackles is a basic national policy. The Kowloon leased territory will eventually be recovered, which is only a matter of time. If we file a negotiation at the appropriate time, our friendly country Britain will surely be happy to agree. The petition delegation included more than 50 teachers and students from 12 schools, including National Chengchi University, the Affiliated High School of Central University, the Frontier School, the Central Midwifery School, the Jianguo College of Law and Business, Jiangning Normal School, the Municipal No. 2 High School, No. 3 High School, No. 5 High School, No. 6 High School, Normal School, and the private Chunghua Girls' High School. They were enthusiastic about patriotism and aimed to supervise and encourage the government. They were serious and orderly. They gathered and set off at about 2:00 PM, chanting slogans along the way and distributing leaflets to fellow compatriots. At 3:30 PM, they arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where Liu Shuaishun and Yin Baoshou met them and gave a detailed explanation of the background and process of the Kowloon Walled City incident and the government's position. They also answered representatives' questions and agreed to forward the petition to Foreign Minister Wang. The delegation then reorganized and went to the Executive Yuan to petition. The requests put forward in the petition were: (1) Please the government firmly insist that the British side bear full responsibility for compensation for the damage caused by the Kowloon Walled City demolition atrocities; (2) Immediately recover the territories of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

[Another Dispatch] The Kowloon Bloodshed Incident Report to the National All Circles Compatriots Book issued by the National Chengchi University Kowloon Recapture Action Committee on the 15th called on compatriots across the country to rise up together and demand five things: (1) Stop inhumane atrocities; (2) The British side compensates all losses suffered by residents when demolishing houses; (3) The British side is responsible for treating the injured and compensating all their losses; (4) Severely punish the murderers who fired the guns and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future; (5) Recover Hong Kong and Kowloon.

### Guangzhou People are Indignant and Protest the Atrocities of the Hong Kong Police; Reporters Refuse to Travel to Hong Kong

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th] The reaction here to the Kowloon Walled City bloodshed incident has reached its climax, especially after the reports from the Shao Yuan All Circles Comfort Group and the Guangzhou newspapers reporters sent to Kowloon Walled City to investigate returned here on the 14th, which made the public even more angry. It is reported that for the demolition of the Kowloon Walled City, the Hong Kong side has decided to convert the land into a park and continue to expel our displaced compatriots. All circles here have decided to hold a demonstration on the 16th to protest the atrocities of the Hong Kong government, and decided to allocate 500 million yuan, which was sent by Xiao Ciyin of the Provincial Committee to Longcheng on the 14th to provide emergency relief to the suffering compatriots. Anti-imperialist slogans are everywhere on the walls of the British Consulate in Guangzhou, and the people are extremely agitated.

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 15th] Guangzhou News: There will be an anti-British demonstration in Guangzhou on the 16th to protest the Kowloon Walled City incident.

At the same time, the Seamen's Union has announced its readiness to expel all British ships from entering Guangzhou.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] The Guangzhou City Journalists Association decided today that before the Kowloon Walled City incident is resolved, it will reject the invitation of the Hong Kong Airlines to send eight reporters from Guangzhou to Hong Kong for a visit on the 17th, and at the same time does not hope that colleagues from Hong Kong will come to Guangzhou on the company's plane.

[This Newspaper, Bengbu, 15th] People in Bengbu expressed great indignation at the Kowloon Walled City incident. Teachers and students of Chongzheng Middle School donated 100,000 yuan and telegraphed it to Guangzhou Catholic Church on the 15th to transfer it to the Kowloon Walled City refugees.

### UNRRA Water Transport Team Ships Divided Equally Between the Ministry and Shipowners; UNRRA Far East Committee Resolved Yesterday

[This Newspaper] The UNRRA Far East Committee held its 37th meeting at the Bank of China Building at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the principles for transferring UNRRA materials and the dissolution of the committee. As a result, because the representatives of the committee had different opinions on the end of the UNRRA Far East Committee, it was decided to postpone it to next Thursday for an informal discussion at the residence of Cleveland, the director of the UNRRA China Office, and then decide on the closing date. Chairman Yan Huiqing hopes to end it as soon as possible so that the post-relief and rehabilitation mechanism that continues the responsibilities of the UNRRA Administration can carry out its work. At yesterday's meeting, the handling of the UNRRA Water Transport Team was also discussed. It was resolved that the team's ships would be divided equally between the Ministry of Communications and the shipowners. The Ministry of Communications should receive 65 main ships, worth approximately US$6 million. The right to sell the equipment of the Water Transport Team will be the responsibility of the UNRRA Water Transport Team Disposal Committee jointly formed by the UNRRA Administration and the UNRRA. However, the Far East Committee repeatedly stated that the ships of the Water Transport Team, as well as all equipment and materials transferred by the UNRRA to the post-relief mechanism, must not be used for military purposes, but should be used for post-relief and reconstruction. Otherwise, the Post-War Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan can recover the original items at cost.

[Another Dispatch] The 15 branch offices of the UNRRA Administration in various places are rushing to complete the closing work. It is reported that the Zhejiang, Fujian, and Taiwan branch offices have been officially closed, and the remaining branch offices will also be closed in succession in the short term. As for the closing work of the UNRRA Administration headquarters, the government has limited it to be completed within five months, and it is expected to be completed on schedule.

### 43,000 Tons of Rice to be Shipped from the U.S. to China

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] Chinese diplomatic circles here told the Associated Press that they deeply hope that 43,000 tons of rice will be able to leave the U.S. port and be shipped to China within the next two or three weeks. They said that this rice is US$30 million, which is planned to be supplied to China after the end of the UNRRA. This is because of procurement difficulties, and the relief supplies that have not been delivered to China before. It is reported that these difficulties have also stopped the delivery of medical relief supplies to China after the end of the UNRRA. In addition, the rice worth US$30,000 agreed upon by China and the UNRRA after the end of the UNRRA to purchase from Siam has not yet been shipped to China, but it is deeply hoped that the rice can leave Siam and be shipped to China within a month or six weeks. Well-informed sources said that the coup in Siam was one of the reasons for the delay in shipping the rice. Chinese diplomats said that in the UNRRA post-completion plan, the actual food delivered to China so far is only 16,219 tons of flour and wheat. The plan also stipulates the supply of medicines, some of which must be obtained from countries other than the United States. At the same time, it was also heard that the U.S. Department of State is making preliminary decisions on the various types of goods supplied to China under the 18 million yuan temporary relief plan. Well-informed sources said that these funds will be used to purchase food, fertilizer, medical relief supplies, cotton, oil, and plant seeds (mainly cotton seeds), but when this plan will take effect after the procurement of the products is completed is unclear.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th, Associated Press] It has been learned that the International Emergency Food Conference has increased the amount of rice allocated to China in the first half of this year by 4,500 tons, so the total number has reached 204,600 tons.

### Henan Educational Personnel Are Successively Withdrawing; Air Transport to Laohekou Is Problematic

[Special Dispatch] According to news from church sources in this city: the Zhengzhou Southern Church Hospital, a large-scale facility with 100 beds, began withdrawing from the 14th to avoid the threat of bandit troops. The church plane "St. Paul" has already transported the first batch of hospital equipment and the hospital director, Ennis. Director Ennis said that the hospital will be moved to Guilin. The main equipment in the hospital will be airlifted to Hankou by St. Paul first, and then transported to the destination. In addition to equipment, the church plane also transported several Swedish female missionaries from Zhengzhou. Most of them came from Luoyang. The church personnel in Zhengzhou are now gathering at the airport, waiting for air transport. An old American missionary, who experienced the great disaster of 1927, sighed, "In today's situation, I am afraid that all of us will withdraw from China."

Before the withdrawal of the Zhengzhou Southern Hospital, the Xinyihui Church Hospital in Queshan was moved in advance because the county was under fierce attack by bandit troops, and the hospital site and its staff dormitory were severely damaged. Dr. Fant, the person in charge of the hospital, later told people: Three divisions of bandit troops once attacked the hospital site. With the help of the elite artillery of the group wall, they bravely repelled the bandits with a small number of people. There is truly much to be praised for their bravery. Those who broke through with Fant included his wife and three American nurses. They all boarded a military plane carrying parachutes and left the city. After reaching a safe location, they took the Pinghan Railway to Hankou.

As for the Laohekou area, because the 12th Division of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops has crossed the Han River, the military situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Foreign missionaries in the area have been concentrated, waiting for planes to withdraw to Hankou. The "St. Paul" was originally scheduled to fly to Laohekou yesterday, but it is now known that it did not happen due to technical problems. Because the ground equipment of the Laohekou military airport was dismantled and moved a week ago, the pilot of the St. Paul believes that it is not advisable to risk landing before ground contact is restored. Several weeks ago, the American Embassy in Nanjing requested our government to allow the church plane to land at Laohekou Airport in order to evacuate the missionaries. At that time, it was not approved due to military relations. The current situation of the missionaries in that area has caused anxiety among the churches here.

### Draft of Implementation Measures for the Financial Portion of the Economic Program: Full Text

[Special Dispatch, Nanjing, 15th] The draft of implementation measures for the financial portion of the economic reform program has been formulated, and is recorded as follows:

I. Consolidating Public Finance

Original Plan (1): The public revenue and expenditure system should be revised, and provincial financial resources should be increased to achieve self-sufficiency. The statutory taxes of counties and cities should be reorganized to strictly prohibit illegal apportionment, so that local finances can be developed soundly to meet the needs of local construction.

Implementation measures:

A. Revision of the revenue and expenditure system:

The current public revenue and expenditure system is a three-level system. After the decision on this draft, the national public revenue and expenditure will be divided into two major systems: the central public finance and the local public finance. The local public finance will be further divided into two levels: (1) provinces and municipalities directly under the central government, and special administrative regions; (2) counties, municipalities under the jurisdiction of provinces, or establishments equivalent to counties and cities. As for the division of tax sources between the central government, local (provinces and cities), and counties (municipal bureaus), during the period of national mobilization to suppress the rebellion, the current public revenue and expenditure system will still be temporarily followed. However, it is proposed to allocate to the localities in advance the central tax revenues that are suitable for profit-sharing to subsidize the localities, or for the localities to collect on behalf of the central government (detailed measures will be given later). It is also proposed to transfer all land tax revenues to the localities after the implementation of the constitution in order to increase local financial resources.

B. Enriching provincial (municipal) finances:

(1) Land tax. After the implementation of the constitution, the land tax is proposed to be changed to a local tax, with provinces and counties each accounting for 50% of the income. Municipalities directly under the central government will still contribute 40% to the central government. Before the implementation of the constitution, it will still be a tax shared by the central government, provinces, and counties. The proportion will still be handled according to the current method. (2) Public grain collected with taxes. It is proposed to allocate 50% of the local public grain collected with taxes to each province and county. However, the province should use half of the income to coordinate the surpluses and deficits of the counties and cities within the province. (3) Business tax. It is proposed to allocate all of the business tax to the provincial finances. Except that municipalities under provincial jurisdiction should still be given 50%, 50% will be exempted from being distributed to counties. The proportion of contributions to the central government by municipalities directly under the central government will still be handled according to the current method before the implementation of the constitution. After the implementation of the constitution, all of it will be classified as the income of municipalities directly under the central government, and its tax rate will be increased separately. For those who pay taxes according to the amount of business income, it is proposed to increase it from 1.5% to 3%. For those who pay taxes according to the amount of business profit, it is proposed to increase it from 4% to 6%. (4) Deed tax. It is proposed to classify all of this income as county and city income, and the additional income originally belonging to counties and cities will be changed to provincial income. (5) Special taxes. It is proposed to allow municipalities directly under the central government to levy special taxes in accordance with the law based on the actual needs of the local area.

C. Reorganization of county finances:

It is proposed to start with three items in the reorganization of county finances, which will be described separately as follows: (A) Increase in tax allocation: (1) Inheritance tax. Increase the proportion of inheritance tax allocated to counties and cities. It is proposed to increase the ratio from 30% to 70%, and stipulate methods for county and municipal governments to assist in tax collection. (2) Local tobacco and local wine tax. It is proposed that the central government entrust counties and cities to collect taxes on its behalf, and allocate 50% of the income to counties and cities. The methods for assisting in tax collection are also proposed to be revised immediately. (B) Adjustment of tax rates: (1) Tax rates for various donations and taxes. The tax rates for housing donations, business license tax, user license tax, slaughter tax, banquet donations, entertainment donations, deed tax, etc. are proposed to be increased separately, and the methods of collection are improved. (Detailed measures for this item have recently been approved by the Executive Yuan by a special project of this department, and are now in the process of completing the legislative procedures.) (2) Farmland tax rate. Adjust the farmland tax rate and registers to equally bear the tax, investigate different places, and increase income. The measures for this plan will be drafted by this department jointly with the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Land Administration, and will be submitted for approval and implementation. (C) Increase in tax sources:

(1) Special taxes. Any reliable donations and taxes that people are willing to pay or that do not harm the livelihood of the local people (such as livestock tax in the Northwest, marine products in the Southeast, medicinal materials and special crops in the mountainous areas, etc.). Localities will be allowed to handle or organize them in accordance with legal procedures, and they will be recognized as legal taxes in the locality.

D. Enriching township finances:

(1) Setting up guaranteed fields. The income from at least 30 mu of guaranteed fields per bao (unit) is designated as the township baojia (security system) fund, and land without owners and land collected in accordance with the law will be allocated to it. (2) Enriching township education funds, holding a study valley donation with the approval of the public opinion organ, and designating 50% of the township's publicly owned funds and production income as township education funds. (3) Strictly implement the regulation that township expenses account for more than 50% of the county budget.

E. Prohibition of illegal apportionment:

(1) All counties and cities should effectively implement local general budgets, and there should be no other income and expenditure. If new local undertakings need to be carried out, the supplementary income and expenditure budget should be handled in accordance with the law first, and it can be implemented only after it is approved. (2) For undertakings that do not belong to local autonomy, such as those entrusted by the central government or the province, the expenses should be allocated by the entrusting agency. (3) Any organization that illegally collects taxes on a regular basis shall not directly collect any money or goods from the people. Those who violate this shall be dealt with in accordance with Article 129 of the Criminal Law. (4) Formulate measures for counties and cities to develop special taxes to restrict local apportionment.

Original Plan (2): The tax rates of direct, commodity, customs, and salt taxes should be carefully adjusted in light of the people's ability to pay taxes in order to increase the national treasury income and equalize the people's burden.

A. Adjustment of direct tax rates

(A) For income tax, except for the income tax of the first type of profit-making enterprises, which still adopts the full progressive tax rate, the income taxes of the remaining second, third, fourth, and fifth types will all be changed to proportional tax rates to facilitate collection. (B) The income tax threshold and tax rate shall, in accordance with the British system, be determined in light of the national economic situation and the needs of national finance before the start of each year, and shall be submitted to the legislative body for review and promulgation and implementation in order to adapt to fluctuations in prices and the ability of the people to bear the burden. (C) Raise the threshold for inheritance tax and reduce the tax rate. The current tax law stipulates that the current tax law progresses from 2% to 60%. It is proposed to change it from 1% to 25%. As for the tariff level, it is proposed to reduce it from 17 levels to 8 levels to facilitate promotion. (D) Increase the fixed rate of stamp tax. It is proposed to increase it appropriately according to the situation at that time. (E) Change the standard of levying special business tax based on income amount or income amount, so that businesses with high income can bear a higher tax amount to equalize the burden.

B. Commodity Tax

(A) Increase the tax rate on luxury goods. Among commodity taxes, such as cigarettes, foreign wine, local tobacco, local wine, tinfoil, superstitious paper, cosmetics, etc., are all luxury goods, and a tax of 45% to 100% is currently levied on the price. After that, it is still planned to adjust the tax rate in the future based on the price of goods and the ability of merchants to bear the burden. The original tax rates for wheat flour, cotton yarn, coal, iron, and mineral products are all still low, and it is proposed to temporarily not increase them to avoid stimulating prices.

C. Customs Duties

(A) Restore the collection of import taxes on gasoline and diesel, and increase the original import tax rates for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene to 50% of the price (this plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implemented since October 1, 1947). (B) Revise the import tariff in accordance with the tariff principles approved by the government and the obligations accepted by our country at the World Trade and Employment Conference in order to seek the customs revenue medium.

D. Salt Tax

(A) Uniform tax rate: After the victory, the salt tax rate adopted different rates to adapt to the different environments of the recovered areas. There were as many as ten types of rates. After repeated adjustments and simplifications, this year's August has been adjusted again, classified and unified as 100,000 yuan per dan for ordinary edible salt and 80,000 yuan for Tu Gao salt. The national unity, the people bear an average, and the audit and collection are convenient. In the future, it is planned to follow this principle. (B) Adjust the tax rate: The new tax rate adjusted in August is about 16,000 times higher than the average rate before the war, but it is still less than half of the price. In terms of the people's ability to pay taxes, the burden is still light. In the future, it is planned to consider the price changes, the people's ability to pay taxes, and the needs of the treasury expenditures, and continue to discuss the adjustment plan when necessary.

Original Plan (3): Develop new taxes and donations in accordance with the principle of those who have money pay money to meet the needs of nation-building.

Implementation Measures: Hold a special donation for nation-building, stipulating that individual citizens of the Republic of China are the levy target. For individuals with a total amount of wealth of more than 5 billion, the starting tax rate adopts a progressive amount system, from 10% to 50%. The handling procedures are divided into declaration, nomination, accusation, investigation, and assessment. The public opinion organ is responsible for nomination, the local relevant organization is responsible for investigating and estimating the value, and the competent collection authority assesses the donation based on the actual value of the investigated property. Original Plan (4): Adjust the collection agency, strictly control the tax source, and improve the audit procedures to strengthen the efficiency of tax administration and reduce collection costs.

Adjust the collection agency, strictly control the tax source, and improve the audit and collection procedures to strengthen the efficiency of tax administration and reduce collection costs.

Implementation measures:

A. Adjustment of the organization

A. Direct tax: (A) Strengthen the base branch, enrich the manpower tax source, and do not salt the collection fee. All branches with more than 30% of the tax revenue will be merged to save expenses. (B) Considering the tax revenue situation, the provincial and regional agencies will be merged. Recently, Guizhou and Shandong provinces have a shortage of tax sources. The Guizhou Direct Tax Bureau has been merged with Yunnan into the Yun-Gui Direct Tax Bureau, and the Shandong Direct Tax Bureau has been merged with the Henan District into the Lu-Yu Direct Tax Bureau.

(B) Commodity Tax: (A) All branches and county offices with a ratio of income and expenditure exceeding 30%, and factory and mine personnel with a ratio of income and expenditure exceeding 20%, will be closed or reduced in number at any time to save expenses. (B) Considering the tax revenue situation, the provincial and regional agencies will be merged. Recently, the Guizhou Commodity Tax Bureau has been merged with Yunnan into the Yun-Gui Commodity Tax Bureau.

C. Customs duties: In order to meet the needs of audit and collection and prevent private transportation in South China, it is planned to adjust the branch institutions as follows: (1) Huludao Branch Customs, which belongs to Qinhuangdao, will be changed to the jurisdiction of Yingkou Customs. (2) Taipei Customs will be moved to Keelung. (3) Change Wuzhou Customs to a branch Customs under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Customs. (4) Nanning Customs will be abolished. (5) Longzhou Branch Customs will be upgraded to a General Customs. (6) Beihai Branch Customs will be upgraded to a General Customs. (7) A branch Customs will be added to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, under the jurisdiction of Jianghai Customs. (8) In Jiulong Customs, four branch Customs and eleven branch offices will be added in the areas of Baisezhou, Yantian, Shayupu, and Nanao in the district, and guard posts will be set up in the cargo-important areas between the branch Customs to specialize in observation and investigate private salt. (9) A branch Customs will be added to the Guanwan area outside Hong Kong. (10) A branch Customs will be added to the Qinglong Mountain area outside Macau.

D. Salt: (A) Cut and merge inspection cards. After the victory, the salt affairs policy focused on abandoning the actual production area, shrinking the sales area, and cutting and merging inspection cards as much as possible. Since its implementation, more than 600 agencies have been cut and merged one after another. (B) Reduce troops in the sales area. After the sales area is reduced, the salt police forces originally stationed in the sales area have also been reduced to the minimum. (To be continued)

### The Repayment Ability of Western European Aid Recipients: US State Department Submits Report, Categorizing Repayments into Grants, Loans, and Cash

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The State Department today released new figures regarding the Marshall Plan, covering the imports and exports, production, and political situations of each participating country, but without disclosing the amount and method of US aid allocation. State Department officials also stated that they have decided that aid to Greece and Austria should be in the form of purchases; aid to Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, and Iceland should be partly in the form of grants and partly in goods; aid to Ireland, Sweden, and Norway should be in the form of loans; and goods provided to Switzerland, Portugal, and Turkey must be repaid in cash. The following is a breakdown of the parts concerning each country mentioned in the State Department report:

Britain: During and after the implementation of the European Recovery Program, rationing of food, clothing, and gasoline in Britain will continue. Britain's gold and dollar reserves currently total approximately $2 billion, but by the end of 1948, they will be only half that amount. A dollar trade deficit will continue for several years, and Britain's external payments are expected to be balanced around 1952. Regarding food, it will take until at least 1952 to restore pre-war levels. Britain's current control system will continue to exist before 1952, and the pound may depreciate. Politically, the State Department believes that there is no fundamental difference between the foreign policies of the Labour and Conservative parties. Within the Labour Party, there are left-leaning and centrist factions. The Communist Party's influence in Britain is extremely weak. Britain's overseas territories are of great help in assisting Britain's recovery and balance of payments.

France: The success of the Schumann government and its political rivals' struggles and the completion of its strong economic policies will be difficult to achieve within a few years without foreign aid. The key to France's parliament and Western Europe is whether to allow the French economy to collapse, establishing a communist dictatorship in the chaos, or to strengthen the forces of democracy in Western Europe. Currently, the French government has a breathing space, which is due to General de Gaulle's unwillingness to retake power during the winter and the fact that many parliamentarians do not dare to overthrow the interim government before the Communist Party's power is broken.

Greece: The State Department believes that there is no doubt about the legitimacy of the current Greek government. Only one-third of the guerrillas are true communists, and the rest are fugitives. Therefore, if the strength of the guerrillas can be reduced and internal stability established, then the Greek government's economic recovery plan and the aid currently provided by the United States can form the basis for a minimal recovery. If guerrilla activities can be stopped, the people's living standards can be maintained. Communism began to expand in Greece during the chaotic conditions after the war. If Greece obtains a stable economic and necessary construction base, it can maintain independence and safeguard a free and independent system. However, if the People's Party or the Liberal Party withdraw from the current coalition government, it will be difficult to form a stable government.

After the Implementation of the Marshall Plan, the Living Standards of Germans Remain Low: Currency Reform in the British-American Zone Is Inevitable

Germany: After the completion of the Marshall Plan, the standard of living in Germany will continue to be tight. Consumption will remain lower than before the war. Only the per capita consumption of tobacco and sugar is expected to reach 70% of pre-war levels. Meat consumption will be only 60% of pre-war levels, and oil consumption will be only 40% of pre-war levels. The report also stated that a new currency must be adopted in the British-American zone of Germany to greatly reduce the circulation of banknotes. If the four powers do not reach an agreement on reforming the currency system for all of Germany, currency reform in the British-American zone is inevitable.

Italy: The State Department believes that the absorption of Italy's surplus labor by other countries is a necessary condition for its economic stability. The main causes of Italy's economic difficulties are rapid population growth, food shortages, inflation, and widespread unemployment. Politically, the State Department believes that the recent strengthening of centrist political forces in Italy is due to the people's aversion to the unrest stirred up by the Communist Party and some unfriendly actions taken by the Soviet Union. However, the existence of a moderate Italian government still depends on improving its severe economic situation.

Turkey: Turkey was not affected by the war, and its government can maintain a consensus on foreign policy. Therefore, the economic recovery problems it faces are different from those of most European countries. Since 1945, Turkey has been under constant external pressure, forcing the government to maintain a standing army of 600,000, which has caused serious financial and human resource problems. It is expected that after the completion of the Marshall Plan, Turkey's foreign trade will greatly increase, and the imports it receives under the aid program will not be difficult to repay in cash.

Switzerland: The State Department suggests that Switzerland contribute to the Marshall Plan by lending its gold and foreign exchange to other countries under the Marshall Plan. The report believes that Switzerland has the highest standard of living in Europe, and its government's stability is not threatened by any political or economic problems. The State Department also believes that Switzerland, Portugal, and Turkey do not need financial assistance, and even if there is a trade deficit, it is extremely small.

### Stassen Advocates Suspending Machinery Shipments to the Soviet Union

[United Press, Lake City, 15th] Republican presidential candidate Harold Stassen stated that the United States should stop shipping machinery to the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate. He said that the Taft-Hartley Act is basically good, but it still needs to be amended.

### Meeting of Sixteen European Nations Unlikely to Reopen

[Reuters, London, 15th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the meeting of the sixteen European nations is unlikely to reopen, which would cause inconvenience to the US government. The spokesman's remarks were intended to respond to US Under Secretary of State Robert Lovett's statement in Washington yesterday that it is not appropriate to reopen the meeting of the sixteen nations before the US Congress concludes its debate on the Marshall Plan. It is expected that the invitation that Britain will issue to the other fourteen nations after the talks in London will not specify a date for the reopening of the meeting.

### Western Europe Should Receive US Aid, But the Amount Has Not Been Determined: State Department Spokesman Claims

[US New Agency, Washington, 14th] A State Department spokesman said today that how much US aid the countries of Western Europe will receive in the European Recovery Program has not yet been decided. The spokesman's statement was in response to a question regarding news contained in the New York Times and other reports. The statement read: "No decisions have been made to date regarding the amount or method of financial assistance to European countries. This matter must be decided after Congress takes action, and the administrator of the European Recovery Program, under the advice of the government, will consult with the National Advisory Council and make decisions based on the facts at any time. Any estimates regarding the amount or method of assistance at present can only be regarded as speculation."

### US Military Authorities State the Importance of Aid to Europe

[Our Report] New York, 15th broadcast, Washington report. US government military authorities Royal and Forrestal today told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the purpose of the Marshall Plan is to prevent war. If Congress does not approve the Marshall Plan, it is necessary to immediately strengthen national defense. The government is requesting $6.8 billion for the first fifteen months of implementing the Marshall Plan. If our country has to greatly strengthen national defense due to the deterioration of the European situation, the cost will be far higher than this figure.

### Rumor of International Communists Planning a Scheme to Destroy the Ruhr Industrial Area: Aiming to Undermine the Marshall Plan

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] The "Berlin Post," registered with the French authorities, stated that the Ruhr area recently discovered a Communist plot to cause Ruhr industry to stagnate in order to undermine the Marshall Plan. According to reports, the German Communist Party has a so-called "M Plan," which states that the key point of the winter battle is to defeat the offensive of the monopolistic capitalism and imperialistic Marshall Plan. The newspaper also stated that the nine-nation Communist Information Bureau in Belgrade has been responsible for coordinating socialist movements in Europe to jointly resist the Marshall Plan. The plan includes launching simultaneous strikes in the transportation and production industries, scheduled to complete preparations by the end of February 1948, and launch in early March.

[United Press, Berlin, 15th] After newspapers under Soviet control threatened to ask Britain and the United States to withdraw from Berlin, and the US military government replied that it would not consider changing the four-power joint administration of Berlin, German trade union leaders in the Ruhr area today threatened a general strike of four million workers. According to reports from Frankfurt, railway workers in the western zone also have the intention to strike.

### UN Security Council Met Yesterday to Review the Kashmir Case: India Demands an End to Pakistani Assistance to the Unrest

[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] The Security Council met on the 15th to review India's complaint against Pakistan regarding the Kashmir issue. Indian representative Gopalaswami Ayyangar will deliver a 6,000-word speech. The British representative in attendance is Commonwealth Relations Secretary Philip Noel-Baker. Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafarullah will attend in person and will request a postponement of the debate, citing poor weather and late arrival in New York without adequate preparation.

[United Press, Lake Success, 15th] Indian representative Gopalaswami Ayyangar declared at the United Nations Security Council today that unless the United Nations finds a way to stop the conflict in the State of Kashmir, India may engage in a large-scale war with Pakistan. As the situation becomes increasingly serious, the Security Council must advise Pakistan on the following three points: Stop Pakistani military and political officials from assisting in the invasion of Kashmir. Ask the people of Pakistan to refuse to participate in the unrest. Do not allow indigenous forces to use Pakistani territory to attack Kashmir.

### Soviet Union Attaches Importance to the Situation in India

[Reuters, London, 14th] Twenty-four hours before the Security Council began the debate on the Kashmir case, political figures here revealed a certain conspiracy to undermine the resolution of the Kashmir issue. The Soviet trade union newspaper "Trud" published an article on January 11, pointing out that Britain and the United States, with imperialistic intentions, are attempting to break the relationship between the two dominions of India and Pakistan. The newspaper stated that Britain and Pakistan have a secret agreement that allows Britain to maintain bases in Pakistan, and also accused Indian Governor-General Mountbatten of instigating Kashmir's annexation to India. It also said that the invasion of Kashmir by tribesmen from the Northwest Frontier Province was instigated by British spies. The newspaper further accused the British government of implementing a "divide and rule" policy in the Indian peninsula in order to establish a new form of rule in the two dominions of India and Pakistan. While denying the aforementioned accusations, government officials here stated that the British government will do its best in the Security Council to ensure that the issue is resolved peacefully and quickly.

### Gandhi's Second Day of Fasting: Urges India and Pakistan to Cease Fighting

[United Press, New Delhi, 14th] Today is the second day of Gandhi's fast. According to doctors, he has been in good spirits for the first 31 hours and shows no abnormalities. He is currently lying on a cot on the lawn of Birla House, carrying on with his affairs as usual. Tonight, he also participated in prayers, asking Pakistan to abide by its name as the "Land of the Pure." (Note: The meaning of Pakistan is "Land of the Pure"). It is said that he often considers the partition of India to be a sin, but Pakistan should not be warned, rashly making this move, hoping to do well on its own and not ruin its name. I am old and about to die, but if all religions can live together peacefully like brothers, the joy in my heart will not be less than that of children playing games.

### A Major Achievement of the Mediation Committee: India and the Netherlands Sign a Ceasefire Agreement; Indonesia Condemns the Netherlands for Forming a Puppet Federation

### After the Purge of Rikizo Hirano, the Political Situation in Japan May Be Temporarily Stable: Various Factions Active on the Eve of the Socialist Party Congress

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Japanese Socialist Party cabinet ministers Katayama, Nishio, Mizutani, Suzuki, etc., met at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday afternoon to discuss the Socialist Party's countermeasures after Hirano's purge. It is rumored that they believe that the purge of Hirano can temporarily stabilize the political situation, and the forces of the three ruling parties can be used to overcome the difficulties of the political situation.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] As the Socialist Party is scheduled to convene a congress tomorrow, various factions have been actively engaged. For example, the centrist Thursday Society held a meeting yesterday, deciding to appoint the current ministers as central committee members, Katayama as chairman, and Asanuma as secretary-general. As for policy, they will not be constrained by the three-party coalition and will strongly implement socialist policies that are suitable for the current situation. On the other hand, the left-wing commissioners also held a meeting yesterday, deciding to abandon the four-party policy agreement and oppose appointing the current ministers as central committee members, only considering them as advisors, and nominating Kato Kanju as secretary-general. If the congress fails to pass the left-wing's nomination for secretary-general, the faction will declare that it will take free action when electing the chairman. In addition, a proposal was made to the Thursday Society that if it agrees with its claim to abolish the four-party agreement, it will agree to nominate Katayama as chairman. However, the Thursday Society has not yet responded.

### Japanese Government Issues Statement: Reasons for Hirano's Purge

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Regarding the purge of Hirano and its political importance, the Japanese government specially issued a statement on the 14th, stating: "On May 5, 1932, Hirano and Shumei Okawa founded the Japan National Socialist Party, and Hirano served as a main cadre and was very active. In 1933, he became a central figure in the Kodo-ha. Although Hirano explained that this was for the purpose of farmers' movements, as the highest cadre of the association, he should be held responsible.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The Japanese government announced that although Hirano's dismissal as Minister of Agriculture has been publicly announced, his status as a member of parliament acquired before joining the cabinet has not been revoked. It specially notified the House of Representatives to inform Hirano, ordering him to automatically resign his parliamentary seat before the 21st.

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Hirano told a United Press reporter that he will appeal directly to MacArthur. He still insists that his purge is due to the pressure of some Allied officials.

### Zenno Expresses Determination to Form a New Party

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] After receiving the report of Hirano's purge, the Zenno faction convened a meeting of executive committee members yesterday, deciding to continue to form a new party, and issued a statement stating that "Hirano's purge has no connection to the movement to organize a new party, and the struggle against the political issues of purging Hirano will not end with this."

### Outlook on the European Situation By Our Special Correspondent, Saben Geng

We only need to recall that the First World War originated in continental Europe, and that the Second World War also used Europe as one of its main battlefields, to imagine that even today, when the world's financial center and international organizations have moved to New York, continental Europe still retains its important position on the international political stage. Learning from the past to understand the future, our review of the European situation in 1947 can greatly enhance our understanding of the European continent, as well as the world political situation in 1948 and beyond.

Logically speaking, 1947 should have been a very important year for continental Europe, because during this year, it should have laid the foundation for long-term peace on the European continent. In fact, whether it achieved this or not, continental Europe did indeed have some extraordinary events during this year. Let's start with a simple "chronicle of events."

March 10 to April 24, 1947: The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France met in Moscow to discuss the issues of Germany and Austria, but dispersed without any results.

June 5: US Secretary of State Marshall gave a speech at Harvard, explaining the US economic aid plan for Europe. (Although this matter and the following item 8 did not occur in continental Europe, they were closely related to continental Europe.)

July 12: Sixteen European countries held the European Economic Cooperation Conference in Paris.

September 22: The report of the European Economic Cooperation Committee was signed in Paris.

October 5: The establishment of the Cominform (Communist Information Bureau) was officially announced in Belgrade.

November 25: The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France met in London to discuss the issues of Germany and Austria, but dispersed on December 15 without any results.

December 17: The United Kingdom and the United States signed an agreement on the allocation of expenses in the German occupation zones.

December 19: The US Congress passed the emergency relief portion of the Marshall Plan for economic aid to Europe.

December 24: The Greek Communist Party announced the establishment of a provisional government to resist the current Greek government.

December 30: Romanian King Michael announced his abdication, and Romania established the "People's Republic."

Of course, the above list is only a part of the major events in continental Europe in 1947. Other events, such as the cabinet crises and labor strikes in France, and the political prisons in Eastern European countries, I cannot record one by one. However, even these events are enough to represent the situation in continental Europe in 1947. If we observe the above facts individually, they may not seem very important, or their importance may not be obvious. But if we connect them together, they indeed reflect the mainstream of the situation in continental Europe over the past year.

Purely from the surface of the facts, the problem in continental Europe centers around the German question. The repeatedly held meetings of the four foreign ministers also focused on the German question. Among the German issues, although there were issues such as the eastern border of Germany, reparations, and the future German government, the most important issue was that the Soviet Union hoped for a pro-Soviet, or similar to the current Eastern European countries, Germany, while the United Kingdom and the United States hoped for a Germany that accepted so-called "Western culture." Furthermore, with Eastern Europe already de facto a Soviet sphere of influence, the future of Germany will determine the fate of continental Europe. Thus, the failure to resolve the German issue has intensified mutual suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union. After the four foreign ministers' conference in the spring of 1947 ended without results, both sides were playing chess. The motive behind the Marshall Plan may have been to prevent the spread of communism in Europe, or it may have been to find an outlet for America's surplus productivity, but in any case, it required a stable Europe and opened a door for international cooperation. The refusal of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to participate confirmed the dividing line between Western and Eastern Europe. Developing along the lines of the Marshall Plan was the economic conference of sixteen Western European countries. Although the establishment of the Cominform was said to be for the exchange of information, it was actually more or less a reincarnation of the Third International, and at the same time, it was also meant to counter the Marshall Plan. These preludes had already determined the fate of the failed four foreign ministers' conference in London in November. The failure of the London conference further promoted the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States in western Germany and the US Congress's passage of the emergency relief portion of the Marshall Plan. Under these circumstances, the Greek Communist Party, whether by order or spontaneously, took advantage of the increasing formation of the two blocs to announce the establishment of a government, and the King of Romania abdicated in order to consolidate the situation in Eastern Europe early. This development clearly showed the clear opposition between the two blocs, led by the United States and the Soviet Union.

This situation has a very negative impact on 1948. The problems that were not resolved in 1946 not only could not be resolved in 1947 to lay a foundation for peace in continental Europe, but it seemed to make the problem even more "rigid." The Moscow conference in the spring of 1947 was decided in advance, while the London conference in the winter of 1947 failed to schedule a meeting for this year, which is indeed a great misfortune.

Recalling the period after the First World War, although the handling of every international issue was not satisfactory and did not lay the foundation for peace, there was no such stalemate as today. The main problem is not because the Soviet Union has replaced the position of France after the First World War, but because the Soviet Union, due to its special beliefs and economic system, hopes to have an infinitely large security circle. If we look at the European continent in 1948 from this point of view, the future is naturally very pessimistic. We see that both sides have openly accused each other, which makes it impossible for us to imagine that the problems that could not be solved in 1947 can be solved in 1948. Some people even fear that 1948 will become like 1914 or 1939. However, if we think about it calmly, 1948 may be a very rigid year, but if we say that a global war will break out, that would be too pessimistic. First, the Soviet Union's policy, whether for its own security or for its own expansion, is conducive to a policy of "nibbling"; in other words, it is conducive to gradual expansion, but not necessarily conducive to "war." Under this policy, continental Europe may be very unstable, and the Communist Party may create political turmoil, labor strikes, and even all kinds of panic in various countries, but it may not immediately create war. Second, after the Soviet Union fought against Germany, it was severely weakened. It is said that 1946 was still a year of famine, and the five-year plan after the war has not been completed. Obviously, if there is a war, it must be a long-term war. I don't think the Soviet government has the confidence to support another long-term war today. Third, the Eastern European countries on the periphery of the Soviet Union have not yet recovered economically, and are not yet stable politically. It seems that they cannot yet be used as war capital. On the British and American side, Britain's current situation, economically speaking, it absolutely does not want to and cannot support an international war at the same time. Although the United States has an advantage in terms of materials, and is geographically distant, the countries in Europe that can be allies of the United States have very limited strength. Under these circumstances, it is also incredible to say that the United States will launch a war. Of course, this is an estimate based on the interests of both sides. The outbreak of war often carries a sense of "accident." In the First World War, the assassination of the crown prince, and in the Second World War, Hitler's attack on the East, etc., no one ever thought that it would cause such a protracted war. Therefore, when neither side has confidence, the possibility of war is still very small. I am in a position to assess the situation. The European continent in 1948 may be a situation of tension. On the one hand, it is trying to stabilize Western Europe, and on the other hand, it is consolidating Eastern Europe. It is possible that there will be many unresolved problems, and it is also possible that there will be turmoil and unrest within some countries. (Sent from London on January 5, 1948)

### Police Officer of the Sichuan Road Police Station Detained, Disputes at Tongji University Expand, Principal Ding Subsequently Denies Summoning Police to the School to Suppress Students, City Police Bureau States That It Will File a Lawsuit

[Our Newspaper Report] Disputes over the re-election of the Student Union at National Tongji University suddenly escalated yesterday. The reason for this is that after the school was ordered the day before yesterday to publicly announce the Student Union charter promulgated by the Ministry of Education, some students, Du Shoubai and He Changcheng, dissatisfied with the content of the announcement, tore up the announcement. The authorities believed that the students had destroyed public property and disrespected teachers, and thus expelled Du and He from the school. After this incident occurred, more than 1,600 students from all colleges of the school gathered at the law school square on North Sichuan Road from morning to evening yesterday to petition Principal Ding Wenyuan, demanding two points: 1. Recognition of the Student Representatives Congress elected by universal suffrage in the current session. 2. Rescinding the order to expel Du Shoubai and He Changcheng, directors of the previous Student Union. Mr. Ding initially refused to consider it. Until 5 p.m. yesterday, he negotiated with student representatives, but no agreement was reached. However, Mr. Ding had agreed to convene a guidance meeting at 2 p.m. today to reconsider. Regarding the legality of the Student Union elected by universal suffrage, Mr. Ding said that it must be handled in accordance with the regulations of the ministry's charter. If students have any opinions, they can provide them in writing so that they can be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for review. At this point, the students returned to their colleges separately, waiting for the decision of today's guidance meeting.

At around 11 a.m. yesterday, while the students of the school were collectively petitioning Principal Ding, a middle-aged man with suspicious behavior was suddenly discovered in the school's general affairs office, holding a telephone receiver and talking to the outside. They immediately went forward to detain him and searched the following items from him: a No. 3599 handgun, containing seven bullets; a Shanghai Police Bureau No. 1318 badge; a North Sichuan Road Police Station No. 1196 section member symbol; an order from Director Zeng of the bureau appointing Cai Yanzuo to temporarily act as the chief of the judicial section; a national identity card, stating Cai Yanzuo, 35 years old, from Guangdong, with a photo of himself attached; a Tongji University No. 1199 school badge; and two tickets for the North District School Famine Relief and Winter Relief Celebration Evening. The students of the school then convened an emergency meeting of representatives from each department at 2 p.m. yesterday, resolving to protest to the school authorities. At the same time, Cai Yanzuo was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office to request an investigation.

According to news from the District Prosecutor's Office, after an investigation by the prosecutor, Cai Yanzuo was indeed an employee of the North Sichuan Road Police Sub-bureau. Because the bureau had received a report that the school's students had gathered, fearing that there would be an accident, they sent Cai to pay attention. For the convenience of action, he was ordered to wear plain clothes for easy access. Cai has requested an injury examination, and as a result, he was ordered to return.

Principal Ding told reporters last night: He denied that he had summoned the police to the school to suppress students yesterday morning, or issued a school badge to allow him to enter the school. However, he said: The police officers of the bureau may have entered the school on their own to prevent the order within the school from becoming chaotic. As for where Cai obtained the school badge, he had no way of knowing. Mr. Ding further said: I will never recognize the student's election this time.

[Another report] It is heard that the police bureau has filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office because the students of the school detained a police officer.

### City Council Expresses Indignation Over the Unfortunate Incident in Kowloon Walled City, Cables Chairman to Urge Active Negotiations

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai City Council sent a special cable to the chairman regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident, stating: "To Chairman Jiang of the National Government in Nanjing: We believe that the integrity of territorial sovereignty and the protection of people's freedom are the basic conditions for establishing a country. After returning from victory, all lands that were lost or leased in the past should be negotiated for recovery separately in order to strengthen the borders. At the first meeting of this council in September 1946, in view of the Hong Kong government spokesperson's denial that Kowloon Walled City was Chinese territory and China's current exercise of jurisdiction in the area, it was immediately resolved to petition the central government to actively negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macau, and other lands ceded, transferred, or leased due to unequal treaties, and was previously submitted to you for review and implementation via telegram (35). Recently, the Hong Kong government has used the imperialistic style of colonial officials, relying on strength to bully the weak, forcibly demolishing all civilian houses in our Kowloon Walled City, arresting representatives, shooting and injuring people, and disregarding our government's protests. While negotiations are underway between China and the United Kingdom, they are expanding the situation, willingly acting as the chief culprit, and wantonly destroying the traditional friendly relations between China and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, in the battle to defend Hong Kong during this World War, our overseas Chinese bravely resisted and showed a spirit of righteousness, which is clear for all to see. And relying on your wise leadership, China and the United Kingdom and other allied nations fought side by side for several years, and finally achieved complete victory. China's contribution cannot be said to be small. Therefore, the Cairo Conference also reached a direct solution in principle regarding the return of Hong Kong to our country. Upon hearing this shocking news, this council, in the midst of immense pain, believes that the land of Hong Kong and Kowloon should immediately implement our country's established policy and actively negotiate in order to achieve the purpose of getting to the root of the problem, so that the blood shed by the compatriots in Kowloon Walled City will not be sacrificed in vain. As for the Hong Kong government officials' atrocities, the responsibility should be investigated and the British government should be required to severely punish the culprits and compensate for the losses suffered by the compatriots in Kowloon Walled City in order to calm public anger and protect national rights. We await your orders to the utmost. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai City Council, and Xu Ji, Deputy Speaker, kowtow (37) (Zi) (Deleted)"

[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Yan Huiqing, a member of the National Government (pictured), has decided to participate in the election of the Legislative Yuan in this city as a socially respected person, and has legally signed and submitted his application. Mr. Yan is a senior figure in China's diplomatic circles. He is 72 years old, was born in Shanghai, and graduated from St. John's University. He later went to the University of Virginia in the United States for further studies. After returning to China, he served as a professor at St. John's University and the editor-in-chief of the English Department of the Commercial Press. Later, he entered politics, serving as the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Internal Affairs, and other important positions. He also served as an envoy to Britain, the United States, Germany, and other European countries, attended important international conferences, and became famous at home and abroad. In 1932, when China and the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations, Mr. Yan served as the first ambassador to the Soviet Union, making many contributions. Until the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he retired due to health reasons and engaged in various charitable undertakings in his private capacity. In the early days of the Pacific War, when Hong Kong fell to the enemy, although the Japanese tried every means to force him, he remained unyielding. After the victory, he lived in Shanghai, did not ask about politics, and devoted himself to industry and education, serving as the chairman of the Shanghai Cement Industry Association and a director of St. John's University.

### It Is Not Easy to Marry and Find the Right Partner, Afraid of Abandonment and Abuse, It Is Easy to Solve One's Own Problems, But Difficult to Feed the Whole Family

(The above text is on the left corner) Are dancers willing to marry? What kind of person is the ideal husband? Jin Meihong believes that it is best to marry after the dance ban, but choosing a partner is not easy. Most of the people who frequent dance halls are middle-aged now, and there are few young people. For middle-aged people, dancing is just a way to relieve stress and vent emotions. Can they discuss marriage with them? Cohabitation, being a concubine, is uncertain. Temporary material enjoyment will bring endless sorrows! Among the 15 directors of the Dancers' Association, five people hastily married due to concerns about the dance ban. They are all living in rented rooms, and no one dares to imagine when a miserable experience will befall them!

### Most Are Unwilling to Be Concubines

Sun Zhimin said that most dancers are unwilling to be mistresses. Being someone's concubine, being pointed at and touched by the husband's relatives and friends, and being subjected to cold ridicule, they cannot stand this kind of anger. Miss Sun very frankly took herself as an example. She had also dated for several years, and many of her classmates, some of whom were unmarried, were quite willing to marry her, but a civil servant, bearing the burden of two people's lives, was already difficult, how could he support her entire family? And her old mother was suffering from lung disease, and her younger sister had to be raised. Where would the other party get the extra money? In this situation, how could she solve the marriage problem?

All the dancers present agreed that the general public in society discriminated against dancers. If they are not taken as mistresses, who would be willing to marry dancers! But they do not hope to live in a foreign-style house or ride in a car. They are satisfied as long as they can eat enough and their families can get a little warmth.

Meng Yan's ideal husband is: it doesn't matter if he is older, but he must not have a wife, and at the same time, he can give his younger siblings a chance to make a living.

Zheng believes that if someone with a wife wants to take her as a mistress, as long as the family recognizes her and treats her the same as the first wife, then it is not impossible to marry. She doesn't care about hard work, but if she is abused and ridiculed as a mistress, she would rather commit suicide!

### Terrible Examples

They also said: since the anti-prostitution decree was issued, "husband" no longer has any "ideal" requirements; as long as he meets the basic needs, they are willing to lower their standards. However, they are still afraid of getting married. Then, they gave several real-life examples:

A certain dance hostess met a poor but ambitious young man. They fell in love at first sight, she devoted herself to him, and used all her savings to help him study. She also asked her dance patrons to help him find a job. Exhausted physically and mentally after nearly six or seven years, she lived entirely in anticipation. However, her expectations were eventually shattered. The young man forgot the great virtue of her nurturing and abandoned her after graduating. The young man and his family stated that marrying a woman who works as a dance hostess would ultimately be detrimental to their reputation, but he forgot that reputation was bestowed upon him by the lowly dance hostess. The shattered expectations caused the dance hostess to become extremely resentful. From then on, she decided to only love money and not people, engaging in superficial relationships and gambling with the world, enduring ridicule with tears. Recently, she has been living with a soldier in a playful cohabitation. Her only request is to continue her dance career. She said, "I still want to keep some regular customers in my hands, because I'm afraid he'll get tired of me and throw me away!"

Another dance hostess married a middle-class businessman. They could have lived a peaceful life as a normal couple, but unexpectedly, within ten days, they broke up. According to the man, he told people, "I had fun for more than a week, that's enough!"

In the vast sea of humanity, the experiences accumulated inside and outside the dance floor make them realize that marriage is a road they want to take but are afraid to go through. In Shanghai, more than 20% of girls start dancing at the age of fourteen. They have now been in the business for ten years, but they never talk about marriage. When asked about their feelings when the anti-dancing decree was issued last year, they said, "We really can't tell if it's panic or uncertainty..."

### Many Hands Make Light Work - Hoping That All Sectors of Industry and Commerce Will Launch Group Scholarship Assistance

Yesterday, we received a scholarship fund of 12.4 million yuan from Mrs. Liu Minhuai's birthday celebration, which made us think that in a big city like ours, countless people spend countless sums of money on weddings, funerals, and celebrations every day. If they could only save one-tenth or one-hundredth of what they spend, it would accumulate into a huge sum of money. Countless poor students are placing infinite hope on this excess money.

The "Reader Scholarship Fund" has been running for many days, and we have already received donations and encouraging letters and telegrams from several enthusiastic readers. However, we know that the power of individuals is ultimately limited. As the ancient saying goes, "One hand cannot clap, many hands make light work." If the major industrial and commercial organizations in this city could launch "collective scholarship assistance," I believe that the future of the "Reader Scholarship Fund" will definitely have unlimited hope.

### Request to Unload Rice from Ships Causes Conflict on the Banks of the Suzhou Creek

Yesterday morning, two men, Chen Zhixiang and Chen Genxiang, who claimed to be members of the Seamen's Union, led over a hundred unemployed workers to the Northern Rice Market. They said they were representatives of the Xinzhapu Quan Cang Cooperative and requested to unload rice from ships on the Suzhou Creek. However, this type of work has always been the responsibility of the ship workers, assigned by the customers. If other work gangs were to be involved, it would effectively raise the price of rice, which is against the law. Therefore, the request was not approved. A conflict broke out on the banks of the Suzhou Creek. The police department dispatched police vehicles to suppress the situation. After Ji Mingzhai, the section chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, arrived at the scene to persuade them, the workers gradually dispersed in the afternoon.

### Tea Dances and Dance Schools Prohibited First - The Social Affairs Bureau Sent a Document to the Police Bureau Yesterday, Likely to Be Implemented Today

[Reported by This Newspaper] After the anti-dancing decree reached this city, the following measures were stipulated to take effect immediately: No more dance hall licenses or dance hostess licenses will be issued. No more bar licenses similar to dance halls will be issued. Tea dances from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day, except for Sundays, will not be allowed. All dance schools will be ordered to close immediately. The Social Affairs Bureau sent a document to the Police Bureau yesterday. If time permits, the Police Bureau will implement the measures starting today.

There are a total of twenty-nine officially registered dance halls in this city. At the end of this month, half of them will be selected by drawing lots to close by the end of March, and the remaining half will close by the end of September. Chen Su, the tenth section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the bureau has decided that the Dance Hall Association will set the date for drawing lots. At that time, all members will be gathered for a public drawing of lots, and the Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to supervise.

In addition, the implementation measures for the anti-dancing decree stipulate that "dancing is prohibited in all bars that currently have music, dance hostesses, or bar girls providing dance companionship for guests, and those who violate this rule will be closed down immediately." Regarding those with music and dance floor facilities, Director Wu stated that they will not be shut down for the time being, and customers are still allowed to dance with their own companions. However, due to concerns about potential abuses, they are currently studying whether it is illegal to bring dance hostesses to dance. In general, they will not interfere with compensated dancing; however, if it is for commercial purposes, it will be considered a violation. The detailed rules have not yet been finalized. Director Wu expressed strong support for the dance hostesses' preparation for a re-employment fund. He also stated that if there are any difficulties that require assistance, the government will not shirk its responsibility.

House Charity Raffle Ticket Prices Have Not Been Increased

According to the person in charge of the Winter Relief Association's house charity raffle department: Recently, there have been rumors that the prices of the A and B type house charity raffle tickets issued by the association will be increased due to rising prices. This is a complete misunderstanding. The association has no plans to increase the face value of the house charity raffle tickets. Currently, each A type ticket is still sold for 200,000 yuan, and each B type ticket is still sold for 100,000 yuan. Recently, sales have increased sharply since we entrusted major banks, newspapers, and companies to sell them on our behalf. The 1.2 million lottery tickets originally planned for this time will definitely be sold out by the end of February.

The Speaker's Wife Raised a Huge Sum of Money

[Reported by This Newspaper] Mrs. Tang Guanyu, the wife of Speaker Pan and the leader of the third team of the Winter Relief Women's Clothing Collection, has raised 20 million yuan from Zhang Yuwen, 20 million yuan from Zhenxin Yarn Factory, and 150 million yuan from the Shanghai Cotton Business Association, all of which have been deposited into the city bank.

### How Will 4,000 Dance Hostesses Survive? - A Serious Social Problem - This Newspaper Invited Eight Dance Halls and Twelve Dance Hostesses for a Collective Interview

Shanghai currently has more than 4,000 dance hostesses in dance halls of all sizes. Because the government's anti-dancing decree has officially arrived in Shanghai, a serious problem has arisen: "How will they survive in the future?" Although they shouted the slogan of "Self-help and Helping Others" at the general meeting, they are also actively preparing for re-employment. However, is re-employment an easy task? What follows is the question of how to re-employ? Where to re-employ? After re-employment, can their livelihood be solved? These are all things worth considering. As for opening schools and holding technical training classes, although they seem to be a way to solve the problem on the surface, raising funds and how to start classes will take a considerable amount of time. Moreover, the educational level of dance hostesses varies, and the selection of courses is quite difficult. Even if these difficulties are overcome and the dance hostesses can be trained and study, the training period should be at least a year and a half! Then, how will their lives be maintained during this long period? This series of difficulties are the pressing problems that dance hostesses think about day and night, and it is also the entire social problem. As for the general public's belief that the best re-employment for dance hostesses is to get married, how many people can afford the lives of a dance hostess's family? Are dance hostesses willing to be mistresses? These seemingly easy to solve but actually extremely difficult problems are what dance hostesses feel most fearful about. This newspaper, in order to address this rather serious social problem, specially invited twelve dance hostesses representing eight dance halls of all sizes to conduct a collective interview. From their mouths, we gained a deeper understanding that what lies before them is anxiety and hesitation.

In a short three-hour conversation, these ten dance hostesses from various dance halls did not give us the impression that people generally imagine. They are full of a sense of justice, analyze facts reasonably and forcefully, and their strong and powerful speeches all show that they have a good character at their core. Here we can see Jin Meihong showing the talent of a strong leader; Meng Yan with deep thoughts and a speech that can capture people's hearts; and Sun Zhimin, who is eloquent and good at speaking.

Summarizing their opinions: They believe that re-employment is difficult and marriage is not easy. In the end, they hope that the government can grant a grace period.

### The Problem of Re-employment is Full of Difficulties - The Fact That Many College Students Are Unemployed Makes Them Even More Panic-stricken

Meng Yan was the most plainly dressed dance hostess among those who attended yesterday. She wore a blue cloth gown, old cotton shoes, no makeup, and was the most modest and careful when speaking. When describing her sad life, her voice trembled slightly, making people feel pity. She said that as long as she could survive, she would be willing to be a maid. She said, "I became a dance hostess because I had nothing to eat. My mother is old and cannot earn money, and my younger brother is still young and cannot work. Now I rely on earning money to support his studies. If dancing is banned, what will I use to support this family?" Summarizing her opinion on the re-employment of dance hostesses, she believes that some dance hostesses who have received education and have a junior high school education may still have the possibility of changing careers, but what about the majority of illiterate dance hostesses? Miss Meng said that she had not studied, and she had also considered her way out after dancing was banned - working in a factory. What she heard was only layoffs and closures, and it was not easy to get in. Even if she got a job, would it be enough to support the whole family? ... Besides working in a factory, there is also being a maid. She said that she is not unwilling to help people, but the difficulty lies in the fact that although her own life will be solved after helping people, how will her mother and young brother live? What's more, the market is so sluggish now, and everything is soaring in price. Even the big mansions are talking about thrift. After Miss Meng's conversation, her emotions became more intense, her face pale, and her feelings were tense. She said in a painful tone, "I hope to support myself with my own hands. Even if I can't get enough to eat, I'm willing to eat porridge, but you have to give us a way to go! During the enemy-puppet period, we still had a mouthful of household rice to eat. Now the government's ban is as firm as iron, where are we supposed to go?"

Most Have Not Received a Good Education

Jin Meihong believes that more than 70% of dance hostesses have not received a good education, and re-employment training should start with practical skills. However, raising training funds is not something that can be done overnight! What's more, you may not be able to get a job after the training is completed. There are so many unemployed college students!

She added: If a job has both college students and dance hostesses applying at the same time, I dare say that society's choice will definitely belong to college students. She pointed out that the social assessment of dance hostesses' lives as extravagant and absurd is a huge mistake. Although the social butterfly type dance hostesses are on equal footing with dignitaries and wealthy businessmen, they only account for a very small number. Currently, dance hostesses with a monthly income of 7 million yuan are already in the upper middle class, and those with 1 to 2 million yuan are very common. Just think that every dance hostess has family burdens and her own overhead expenses. The meager income is not higher than that of a store clerk. If there is now a store that pays its employees a monthly salary of 3 or 4 million, they would be willing to give up dancing and switch to another job immediately.

Most Are Over the Age of Thirty

They all agreed that there are many "old women" over the age of 30 among dance hostesses, who have been married and had children. However, some sacrificed and some were scattered during the Anti-Japanese War, and some have dying mothers and disabled fathers, so the burden of life cruelly weighed on their shoulders. Society thinks that dance hostesses are seductive and sexually suggestive, but this is just a painful means of earning a living. Some people also say that dance hostesses are despicable and lowly, but aren't there still jobs in Shanghai that are more lowly than dance hostesses? Why is the fate of dance hostesses more tragic than theirs?

There Are Three Practical Difficulties - Finally, They Analyzed That There Are Three Practical Difficulties in the Re-employment of Dance Hostesses: First, more than 10% of the older dance hostesses all have children, sleep late and wake up late, and have difficulty dealing with housework, making re-employment extremely difficult. Second, it is impossible for some dance hostesses who are self-indulgent and have deep-rooted bad habits to re-employ. Third, those who are willing to re-employ but lack skills and opportunities are equivalent to not being able to re-employ. Setting up schools to conduct training under these many difficulties is of course the most ideal, but the initial budget for school expenses requires 10 billion, which still depends on the help and guidance of all parties. Finally, they hope that the government will allocate school buildings for vocational training schools and extend the lottery time as much as possible.

Sun Zhimin said: She has been looking for a job for three months, but has not yet found one, and is quite pessimistic about re-employment. She is unwilling to be a "female employee with conditions" or a "vase with no potential." What's more, in the current sluggish market, it is not easy for those who have skills to find a job, so how can we lose to this big group of us? What she personally hopes for is that the government or social elites will set up a high-level company or other handicraft factories, because running other factories requires a lot of funds, and the dance hostesses also do not have enough skills (continued from the lower right corner)

### Twelve Beauties

The list of the twelve dance hostesses who were invited by this newspaper to talk yesterday is: Sun Zhimin (Yangtze), Jin Meihong, Li Qing, Jin Liping, Wang Meiying (Vienna), Meng Yan, Hong Xiaoping (MGM), Wang Min (Dahu), Wang Ying (Imperial Palace), Qian Suzhen (Victory), Chen Xueli (Huadu), Ye Zhi (Xianle).

### Northern Fujian Highway Network

[Reported from Fuzhou by Airmail on the 8th] There are usually three routes from Zhejiang to Fujian: one is to take a boat from Hangzhou via Shanghai to Fuzhou, one is to go from Wenzhou to Pingyang. Take a small boat to Fuzhou, and the other is to take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway train to Jiangshan and take a car across the Xianxia Ridge into Fujian. The reporter chose the third route this time.

From Jiangshan to Pucheng, from Pucheng to Jianyang, and from Jianyang to Nanping, these three days of 356 kilometers are enough to make people suffer. The car starts from Jiangshan, and the first hurdle is the Xianxia Mountain, the border area between Zhejiang and Fujian. Facing it is a mountain, and passing on both sides are also mountains. People who are used to living in the plains of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be suspicious of being in a foreign land when they first enter here. The mountain roads are rugged, and the highways have to twist and turn. The highway cars have to advance along the line. The reporter personally saw the car bypass a large temple three times near Fengling, the intersection of the highways of the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The first time it passed the base of the temple, the second time it turned around the temple gate, and the third time it reached a road as high as the top of the temple. The twists and turns of the road can be seen from this.

South from Fengling

Passing through Pucheng to Jianyang, this area is traversed by the main peak of northern Fujian, the Wuyi Mountain Range, and is also the source of the Jianxi waterway on the Minjiang River. In addition to the folded mountain peaks, there are also rivers winding back and forth. When walking along the creek, you can see the mountains like walls. When walking on the top of the mountain, you can see the streams like belts. If it weren't for the bumps that made people uncomfortable, the mountain and water scenery would be quite enjoyable. From Jianyang to Jian'ou to Nanping, this section of the road is the famous production area of Jianben in the country and the raw material collection area for Fujian wood. The fir and pine trees on both sides are like mountains and seas. It's the beginning of autumn, the green leaves are still there, and the remaining shade covers the sky, which is a spectacle. After reaching Nanping, the three streams in northern Fujian converge, and the Minjiang River waterway is widened. Passengers to Fuzhou have to abandon their cars and take small motorboats here.

It is said that 15 years ago, this was still a barren path. After the "Fujian Incident" in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the central government ordered the construction of a highway network to connect with the predecessor of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, for military needs. Except for the Jiangxi to Xiaocheng section, if Jianyang is the center, there are four main lines and six branch lines, which creates the so-called "Northern Fujian Highway Network." This

Four Main Lines

Are Distributed as Follows: From Jianyang, it goes east through Shuiji and north to Xiaocheng, a total of 118 kilometers, which can be extended to Jiangshan and connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. From Jianyang, it goes through Wuyi Palace, Chongan, and over the Fen Shuiguan, the border between Fujian and Jiangxi, to Shangrao, the terminal in Jiangxi, a total of 190 kilometers. It can also be connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway currently. From Jianyang, it enters Guangze via Masha and Shaowu, a total of 112 kilometers. This road can be connected with the various highways in eastern Fujian. From Jianyang to Jian'ou, it enters Fuzhou via Gutian, a total of more than 200 kilometers. It enters Nanping and goes up the Minjiang River, extending to Shaowu and Jianning via Shunchang and Jiangle, with a total length of about 200 kilometers. In fact, the reach of this highway network has reached three provinces. There are railways in the north and the ocean in the south. It can truly be called a "network."

However, this road is full of difficulties. Since its construction, it has first been troubled by soldiers and bandits, and traffic has been interrupted from time to time. The actual traffic situation before the war was not impressive. It was not until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, when the transportation between Fuzhou and foreign countries was blocked, and the provincial capital was withdrawn, that this road strengthened its importance. Especially after the 31st year, when the war shifted to the southeast and all the centers along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line moved into Fujian and Jiangxi, this road became even more prosperous. At that time, the frequency of military vehicles traveling back and forth was the highest in the country, creating the highest record of automobile transportation volume, second only to the "Ledo Road" later. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, along with a period of chaos, this road gradually lost its function. There was a time when it was said that it was even interrupted for a short period of time. It was only recently, with the New Jiangxi Transportation Army and the transportation vehicles in the Jinrao area shifting their positions to make a living here, that this road was reactivated.

Currently, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, and the Fujian Provincial Highway Bureau are all

Serving in Rotation on This Line

There are about 50 or 60 trucks and passenger cars traveling back and forth every day. Although the business situation is not very good, it is not bleak either. What is transported out are the local products of northern Fujian, such as bamboo shoots from Pucheng, paper from Shaowu, shiitake mushrooms from Jian'ou, lotus seeds from Jianyang, tea from Wuyi, and rice and miscellaneous grains from various places on the Minjiang River. What is transported back are textiles, daily necessities, and industrial products. This is a unique form of trade in rural China, and of course, this area is no exception. Today, based solely on the reporter's observations, I am very optimistic about the future prospects of this highway network. It can also be said that this optimistic stage has already begun, because with the rich products of northern Fujian, the railway, ocean, and river transportation lines that can reach each other, and the call of "developing the northwest of Fujian" that the Fujianese overseas Chinese have been loudly shouting in recent years, people will ultimately believe that northern Fujian has great potential.

### Road Police at Jiaxing Station Run Amok, Shooting and Killing Student Chen Junming; Hu Xibin and Four Others Seriously Wounded by Bullets

[Our Jiaxing Dispatch, 13th] Because the Jiaxing road police at Jiaxing Middle School, on the afternoon of the 10th, treated Chen Hourong, the seventh team leader of the school, who took the wrong exit, and was besieged and injured, on the afternoon of the 11th, the school negotiated with the police authorities and proposed: An apology; compensation for medical expenses; punishment of the murderers; and a guarantee that similar incidents would not happen again in the future. The road authorities did not accept these conditions.

On the evening of the 11th, the road police arrested Li Weihua, Yang Jincheng, and Zhou Zhiguang, three students who had just returned to school from Shanghai, and severely beat them. Therefore, the students of Qing Middle School went to the station to negotiate. The road police shot at the students, causing Chen Junming to die from bullet wounds.

The injured have been sent to the 31st Hospital for treatment, and leaflets have been printed and distributed to elders from all walks of life.

The students of the school are conducting propaganda in the area around the station and making requests to the authorities: Please punish the murderers who shot the students; please replace the road police at Jiaxing Station; thoroughly improve the road police's attitude towards passengers, and improve the road police's level of knowledge; please the Road Bureau strictly select road police who carry guns, so as not to harm civilians with guns. It is reported that the case is currently being handled by the relevant authorities.

Economic Reform Plan: Draft Implementation Measures for the Transportation Sector

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The draft implementation measures for transportation in the economic reform plan have been formulated by the relevant authorities. The full text is recorded below: (Key points regarding water conservancy have been published in the second edition on the 12th of this month)

Original Plan: In addition to the planned lines stipulated and announced by the central government, railways may be permitted and encouraged to be operated by local and private sectors under the system set by the central government.

Implementation Measures:

A. Formulation and announcement of planned lines and regulations for state-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned systems

Railway planned lines are divided into trunk lines and branch lines. Trunk lines should be state-owned. The planned lines of more than 14,000 kilometers stipulated in the post-war railway five-year construction plan are all major trunk lines. The competent department will implement them step by step depending on the country's financial resources. Meanwhile, a revised and supplementary plan including other trunk lines and branch lines will be formulated, and local and private operations will be encouraged depending on the circumstances. Based on this principle, the competent department will review the existing relevant laws and regulations, such as the Public Railway Ordinance, the Private Railway Ordinance, and technical standards, and revise and submit them for approval and promulgation.

B. Strengthening railway engineering and transportation

Strengthening new construction and restoration projects: The new construction and restoration of various railways that are underway should be completed on schedule according to the established plan. In addition to the necessary equipment for military communication, the rest can be simplified to save financial resources.

Strengthening transportation: Continue to reorganize and enrich transportation equipment and vehicles to increase transportation capacity. Strengthen intermodal transportation to improve transportation efficiency. Pay attention to maintenance to ensure safe military operations and enrich road administration.

Original Plan: In addition to national highways stipulated, announced, and constructed by the central government, the rest are permitted and encouraged to be operated by local and private sectors under the standards set by the central government.

Implementation Measures:

A. Construction and transportation of highways

The national highway network of more than 57,000 kilometers nationwide has been formally announced and stipulated by the Executive Yuan, and the central government will take over in stages. Provincial, municipal, and county roads should first be planned by local governments and submitted to the central government for approval, constructed by local governments, and assisted by the central government. All highway transportation, except for those related to national defense and special needs, may be operated by local or private individuals as stipulated by the central government.

B. Improvement, maintenance, and engineering standards of highways

Strengthening engineering progress: National and provincial highways should be strengthened for reorganization and restoration, and road lines with too low standards should be raised.

Enriching maintenance: Popularize public road maintenance, and pilot mechanical road maintenance in border areas to increase road maintenance effectiveness.

Revising laws and regulations: The Highway Law has not yet been promulgated, and many existing highway laws and regulations need to be supplemented and revised. Technical standards also urgently need to be unified and should be revised, promulgated, and implemented separately.

Original Plan: Airports are operated by the government, and after preparations are complete for airway construction, station equipment, and flight control, efforts should be made to encourage private operation of air transport businesses.

Implementation Measures:

Strengthening equipment, preparing for opening up to private operation

Before the foundation of the aviation industry is stable, the first priority should be to enrich equipment, improve facilities, and ensure aviation safety. The construction of airways, station equipment, and personnel training need to be strengthened urgently. The following matters to be handled are listed as follows

A. Enriching airway construction

Quickly build two major air routes, north-south (Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Haizhou, Shanghai, Fujian, Xiamen, Guangzhou) and east-west (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Yixing, Chengdu, Kunming), and set up various necessary navigation aids along the line, such as radio navigation stations, radio beacons, obstacle lights, and meteorological stations, to ensure safety.

B. Strengthening flight control: Divide the country into eight flight control areas: Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, Xi'an, and Shenyang. Set up air traffic control stations, draw various aeronautical charts, and revise various relevant control regulations to strengthen control.

C. Enriching station equipment

In international airports and domestic air transport center stations, in addition to repairing runways and airports, night navigation equipment will be gradually added.

D. Strengthening equipment for repairing aviation equipment

In order to make the most of existing aircraft and equipment and maintain flight safety, the repair equipment of the two major airlines should be strengthened so that repairs can be carried out at any time at all important stations.

E. Training talents

There is a severe shortage of air and ground aviation technical personnel. In order to expand state-owned operations and prepare for opening up to private operations, the Civil Aviation Administration, aviation technical personnel training institute, and various universities should add or expand aviation technical classes to strengthen specialized training.

Original Plan: Trunk waterways are dredged by the central government, branch waterways are dredged by the province, and the smallest branch waterways are dredged by the county. Important ports are operated by the central government, and secondary ports are operated by the province and city. The central government subsidizes all waterways and ports operated by the province and city with financial and human resources. Efforts should be made to encourage private operation of the shipping industry.

Implementation Measures:

A. Operation of Ports

First, the important and secondary ports along the coast and inland rivers should be divided and designated, and a clear order should be announced. Important ports such as Yingkou, Huludao, Qinhuangdao, Tanggu New Port, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Guangzhou Huangpu, and Nanjing, Yingkou, etc., are operated by the central government. The competent authorities should first carry out construction projects, as well as organize navigation signs, and build breakwaters, etc., complete the port construction plan, and enrich the port management institutions for systematic development. Secondary ports are operated by the province and city, and the central government provides economic and technical assistance. (To be continued tomorrow)

### Primary School Curriculum Standards: Ministry of Education Completes Final Revision; Lists Eight Characteristics; To Be Announced Soon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The final revision of the primary school curriculum standards by the Ministry of Education has been completed by the competent department and is being sent to the Minister for review and will be announced soon. The characteristics of this revision include: In terms of new standard courses, the school's course selection should be based on the grade and season to compile detailed teaching material outlines and teaching material sources, teaching time, etc., and be flexible. Schools in the north, south, and central parts of the country, as well as in the border areas and overseas, can compile and adapt their own courses according to this standard. Also, in terms of time, it is permanent and can be implemented for ten to fifteen years without modification to avoid changes in typesetting and printing. Reduce the weekly teaching time for each school year to ease the burden on students. Merge the moral education standards separated in the 31st year with the hygiene training standards and restore civic training. Stipulate that the national language and common sense should still be compiled separately into textbooks and taught separately. In the first and second grades, only recognize characters without using textbooks. The teachers will compile teaching methods separately and teach in order. Stipulate that calculation structure will formally begin teaching from the third grade, and the first and second grades will be changed to incidental teaching. Restore arts and crafts, and merge the library science department established in the third curriculum standard into the fine arts department to expand the scope and focus on aesthetic cultivation. The music and physical education of the first and second grades will still be combined into singing and games, and manual labor and art will still be combined into work. Strive for uniformity in the standard format of each subject, and strive for the national language in all texts, and change the past style of mixing literary and vernacular Chinese. In short, this revision of the standard is much more progressive than before.

### Shanghai Students Protest Kowloon City Incident; University Representatives to Petition Today; File Protest Letter at British Consulate

Since the Kowloon incident occurred, various universities in this city have successively issued declarations and lodged protests. Considering that the British authorities in Hong Kong and Kowloon are shameless and violent, and have intensified their actions, various universities in this city, in view of the fact that our country's sovereignty cannot be violated and our compatriots cannot be bullied, convened an emergency joint meeting of student group representatives from colleges and universities last night to organize the "Joint Association of Shanghai Universities to Resist the Kowloon Incident." It has been decided to send eight representatives this morning at 10:00 a.m. to first submit a letter to the mayor of the city to petition, and then to the British Consulate to lodge a protest, and at the same time issue a declaration. The participating schools include 12 student groups such as the New Blood Society of Fudan University, the Support Association for Protesting the Hong Kong and Kowloon Massacre of Jinan University, the Student Union of Southeast Medical College, the Patriotic and National Rights Association of Daxia University, the Ziqiang Society, the Patriotic and National Rights Association of Shanghai Business College, the Patriotic and National Rights Association of Shanghai Law School, the Medical Friendship Association of Aurora University, and the United Federation of Student Groups of Guanghua University.

[Our Dispatch] Students of Jiaotong University in this city issued a declaration protesting the Kowloon incident. Acting Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau told reporters yesterday: The government has expressed its firm attitude in negotiating with the British on this matter, and students should wait quietly for the government to seek a reasonable solution through diplomatic channels. Also, in order to prevent primary and secondary school students from being exploited and causing disputes, the Education Bureau has ordered all schools not to take any action.

### Taiwan Provincial Education Group Presents Banner to Education Minister Zhu

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 15th] Zhu Jiahua was warmly welcomed by 15,000 students from the city this morning at 9:00 a.m. After the flag-raising ceremony, he gave instructions, first expressing his pleasant mood. He said: The Japanese education of 51 years was to make Taiwanese compatriots forget Chinese words and characters and forget to be Chinese. However, after Taiwan's restoration, they began to be people of the Republic of China again. He thanked the students for lining up to welcome him, but he hoped that this would be the last time, because he had repeatedly ordered that such actions that wasted studies be prohibited and not to be copied. Then, the banner presentation ceremony was held. National Taiwan University and various specialized schools, national schools, and education groups all presented brocade banners, and the national schools praised him with the words "National Teacher and Protector."

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 15th] Zhu Jiahua told reporters: He is very concerned about Taiwan Province.

### Needy Students Should Not Solicit Donations to Help Themselves Avoid Losing Eligibility for Scholarship Applications: Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Written Statement Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Unified Scholarship Review Committee in this city, issued a written statement yesterday, saying: Education enthusiasts and national institutions from all walks of life in this city, in view of the past method of students soliciting donations to help themselves, not only wastes studies, but also is difficult to obtain practical benefits, have specially raised funds since this semester to jointly organize scholarships, so that needy students can be rescued without labor, and their intention is sincere. It has recently been heard that a small number of students in each school still plan to solicit donations to help themselves. The action is inconsistent with the purpose of the committee. Therefore, the committee has sent letters to the authorities of each school to persuade the students not to participate, and to strictly handle the preliminary review work, so as not to lose the opportunity to win awards. If the authorities of the uncooperative school fail to persuade them, the committee will immediately cancel their eligibility to apply for scholarships. In the autumn of the economic panic, all walks of life in the city are still actively raising scholarships to rescue needy students, which is a rare and commendable act of righteousness. All scholarship recipients should not regard this as a duty to them by all walks of life, and especially should not regard scholarships as a right that they deserve.

### Dutch Overseas Chinese Leader Hopes That Nanjing International Radio Will Increase Reporting of Motherland News to Enhance the Effectiveness of Radio Education

[Our Special Correspondent, The Hague Dispatch, 7th] More than a dozen overseas Chinese in the Netherlands told our reporter today that they hope that Nanjing International Radio will increase the reporting of domestic news from the motherland and improve its power equipment so that overseas Chinese in Europe can listen to news from the motherland at any time. At present, there are about seven or eight hundred overseas Chinese residing in the Netherlands, except for a portion of sailors living on ships, most of the rest have household radios, but it is very difficult to receive shortwave broadcasts from the motherland. A certain overseas Chinese leader said that a few weeks ago, he occasionally received the international radio station's broadcast to Southeast Asia, and the current affairs report only had a few lines, and it was international news. The rest were all "Western music" records. They believe that since the international radio station is broadcasting to overseas Chinese, it should increase the current affairs report, especially the report of domestic news from the motherland, so as to increase the effectiveness of radio education. If it is necessary to broadcast music programs for relaxation, it is appropriate to broadcast Chinese music, or even Peking opera records, so that overseas Chinese will know that it is the radio station of the motherland as soon as they hear it. As for "Western music" and European and American international news, overseas Chinese can read the newspapers of the country of residence, so they can be exempted.

They proposed a full exemption. The Finance Bureau submitted a report to the municipal government for review. It has now been resolved by the 108th Municipal Affairs Meeting that it should still be levied as prescribed. If an application for exemption is made, the exemption should be given in part or in whole depending on its operating performance and burden, as a subsidy from the municipal government to the school. The Bureau of Finance and the Bureau of Education will handle it jointly and it will be implemented starting in the winter of the 36th year.

### Shanghai Cotton Merchants Plan to Form Joint Operation to Purchase Raw Cotton from Production Areas, Aiming to Collect One Million Market Dan Before the End of July

[Our Newspaper Report] Since the leaders of the Shanghai Cotton Commercial Association discussed the future prospects of cotton merchants with Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee and achieved satisfactory results, they have followed Chairman Yuan's instructions and drafted a plan for merchants to operate on behalf of the committee in the future. The main points of the plan are: The name will be Shanghai Cotton Commercial Joint Operation Office. This office will be the point of contact for the Yarn Control Committee. The quantity of cotton to be purchased on behalf of the committee: It is estimated that more than one million market dan of cotton will be collected before the end of July this year. All members of the association can provide credit or physical guarantees to the office, based on their own purchasing capacity, and freely purchase raw cotton from various production areas. Once the plan is approved by Chairman Yuan, the joint operation office will be formally established, and a board of directors will be elected, and managers and staff will be hired. It is reported that after the establishment of the office, it is planned to ask the Yarn Control Committee to coordinate the operating funds for cotton merchants to purchase cotton.

### Yarn Control Committee to Allocate Raw Cotton and Cotton Yarn to Small Yarn and Cloth Factories

[Our Newspaper Report] Yarn factories with less than 3,000 spindles and cloth factories with less than 30 looms will not be subject to the system of spinning and weaving on behalf of the committee. Instead, the Yarn Control Committee will allocate raw cotton and cotton yarn based on the number of spindles and looms, and then purchase the finished products. It is also reported that the deadline for the Yarn Control Committee to handle matters related to yarn, cloth, and replication industry factories and businesses was originally yesterday. However, as the relevant associations were unable to compile the registration forms in time, a special request has been made for a three-day extension.

Cotton Yarn Continues to Fall

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to decline due to tight credit among businesses and continued selling by traders. Demand from buyers was weak, and although replication manufacturers absorbed some of the supply, their appetite was limited. Supply exceeded demand, and the market continued to decline. However, arbitrage trading on the futures market was active, while other parties were less active.

In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell another one million compared to the previous day, to 60.3 million. 20-count converted yarn saw a sharp decline. In the afternoon, arbitrageurs entered the market to cover their positions, which was somewhat encouraging, but the final price was still about one million lower. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also decreased by 300,000 to 1 million or more.

Cloth Prices Decline

The cotton cloth market opened with reports of profit-taking sales, and market sentiment was extremely weak. Tight credit conditions led to selling pressure from long positions, and strong players also competed to sell, strengthening the selling pressure in the market. Prices fell in a straight line. Near the close of the market, buyers from Ningbo and Shaoxing absorbed some of the yuan drill, partially offsetting the losses and slightly improving market sentiment. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth and other fine cloths continued to fall by 65,000 to 30,000, while colored cloth, domestic cloth, and bleached cloth remained stable. The rest all declined by 30,000 to 50,000.

[Our Newspaper Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 4,780 bolts of cloth and 30 bedsheets. There were 102 applicants, of which two were manufacturers who purchased 200 bolts of cloth. The rest were all purchased by cloth shops.

### Unified Bonds Recover, Foreign Stocks Flat and Weak

Trading volume was approximately 4 million, with C bonds rising by 1,500 compared to the previous close. A, B, and D bonds were reported to be up 3,000 yuan, and E bonds were also up 2,000 yuan.

Among foreign stocks, only British American Tobacco (BAT) was strong mid-session, reaching a high price of 950,000, reportedly due to news of changes to the par value. Foreign companies bought in, and film companies sold off. Ewo Cotton opened at 620,000, retreating from 625,000 to close at 570,000. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Cotton, Yihua, Guangzhi Paper, Navigation, and Steel fell by 0.5%, while British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, and Ewo Drill slightly declined.

### Tight Credit and Poor Environment Lead to Initial Rise and Subsequent Fall of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were under pressure from tight credit and a poor environment. Many parties were unable to sustain their positions and sold off their positions, resulting in losses. Mr. Zheng forcefully raised the price within the market at No. 137, while secretly selling 200 million shares outside the market, leading to a rise followed by a fall.

At the beginning of the morning session, the rumors of dismantling over-the-counter trading lines were still prevalent, and the opening of industrial and commercial loans was also silent, leading to a low opening. Wing On Yarn opened at 800 yuan and climbed to 843 yuan, rising to 816 yuan and 860 yuan after opening. Backwardation increased, and over-the-counter interest rates also rose to 0.33 and 0.375, falling to 792 yuan and 839 yuan. Over-the-counter prices continued to be more than 30 yuan ahead of the market. There was a rebound to 810 yuan, and backwardation reached a new high of 862 yuan. However, due to a change in the surrounding environment, there were many downstream sellers, and credit was also unusually tight, retreating to a low of 775 yuan and 829 yuan. No. 157 significantly covered short positions, rebounding to close at 786 yuan and 840 yuan. Xinyi even fell to the limit, while Tongyi recovered after falling to the limit, along with Xinguang, Li'an, and Xinhua, all falling by 10%. Xinhuo, Rongfeng, Meiya, Commercial Press, Match, Jingfu, Qin Xing, and Banque Franco-Chinoise fell by 0.5%. China Industrial rose slightly, while the rest declined slightly. Backwardation stocks rose and fell differently due to backwardation relationships.

The after-hours night report contained news of Hong Kong electricity retracement and industrial loans, opening up to 810 yuan and 854 yuan. It then rose to 820 yuan and 859 yuan. Unexpectedly, while No. 137 was strongly advancing in the market, a large shareholder, Mr. Zheng, secretly sold 200 million shares outside the market. After Hengshu discovered this, the quote immediately lowered, leveling with the market, and the market price plummeted. Xinyi fell to the limit at No. 4, retreating to a low of 767 yuan and 805 yuan. The closing price was 769 yuan and 808 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, the forward contract stock Xinyi fell to the limit, Banque Franco-Chinoise and Meiya rose slightly, Xinguang, Neiyi, Huaxin, Li'an, and Xinhua were all flat, while the rest declined slightly. Backwardation stocks Xinguang and Jingfu fell by 0.5%, while the rest of the stocks rebounded slightly. Over-the-counter unlisted stocks saw banking stocks rise by 0.5%, Huashang fell by 0.5%, inland stocks rose by 0.5%, and the rest of the stocks saw slight gains and losses.

Due to the widespread tight credit conditions yesterday, it was difficult for dealers to cope. Backwardation gradually increased, and those who advanced at a premium could obtain a net profit of 0.19 to 0.3. This was not limited to those who advanced at a premium on the board. Yongsha opened at 40 yuan, rising from 39 yuan to 54 yuan. Xinhuo rose from 20 yuan to 28 yuan, Xinguang rose from 5.3 yuan to 7 yuan at the close, and Meiya was 70 yuan.

### Premium on Large Denomination Notes?

[United Credit Information Agency Report] According to authoritative sources in commercial banks, the supply of cash is tight recently, and deposits have also decreased. 5,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan denomination gold yuan notes are even more difficult to find in the market, so black market premiums have increased sharply. It is reported that a 5,000 yuan gold yuan note requires a premium of 2 million legal tender yuan per 100 million legal tender yuan.

The oil market had strong selling pressure, with ample supply and reduced demand. Prices fell sharply after the opening. Various oils successively plummeted by more than 100,000 yuan, and the situation became weak again.

### Wuxi Grain Prices Fall

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 15th] Due to extremely tight credit conditions, prices here are showing signs of decline.

The prices of matches are high, and sales are sluggish. Meili Fenghuang has gradually fallen by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

In the timber market, although foreign pine prices have risen due to exchange rates, actual sales are weak, and market prices have slightly recovered. The cedar market is also weak.

### Silver and Money Industries to Conduct Settlement Within One Month, Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans

[Our Newspaper Report] The order announcing the implementation of the regulations on the settlement of pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry was officially received by the Shanghai Copper Coin Trust Industry Association from the Ministry of Finance on the 13th. After the announcement of the regulations, the Shanghai Banking Association immediately entrusted the Banking Society to draft a Uniform Handling Method for the Settlement of Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry based on the regulations. After being reviewed by the three associations, it was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for record and notified to all member banks and companies to follow the method. At the same time, a letter was sent to the National Federation of Banking Associations to ask local counterparts to imitate the method to avoid discrepancies in operations. The method is divided into principles, methods, and examples. The three associations will comply with the regulations and begin settlement within one month. Therefore, it is expected that settlement can be handled from January 27th. Before January 27th, the associations will publish a separate public notice in the newspaper. It is also found that the uniform handling method has a total of ten articles. In addition to most of the content already published in the newspaper on the 14th, the remaining provisions are supplemented as follows:

Article 6: The calculation method for the settlement of loans is as follows:

1. If a portion of the principal of the loan has been repaid, but the interest has not been paid, the remaining amount due will be calculated based on the original loan date. The unpaid interest on the repaid portion will be calculated by combining the payment dates.

2. If additional loans or advances are made during the loan period, and the interest has not been paid, they will be calculated separately based on the respective loan dates or advance dates.

3. If the loan interest has been paid up to a certain period, the outstanding amount will be based on the interest accrual from the continued period.

4. If the lender has received funds on behalf of the borrower after the loan is made, it will be regarded as a repayment of the principal, and the remaining amount due will be calculated according to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 of this article.

Article 7: For loans secured by the bank's deposit certificates or passbooks, after the bank offsets the loan according to the contract, the remaining amount will be calculated based on the interest stop date of the loan.

Article 8: The interest transferred into various deposits and loans due to bank interest accrual from August 14, 1937 to December 9, 1941 will not be considered as payment or receipt. Article 9: According to the provisions of Article 7 of the regulations, the way banks notify customers will be through public announcements in newspapers by local banking industry associations, and individual notices will no longer be issued.

Article 10: The sum of the principal and interest of the deposit calculated, all parts above 5 million yuan, shall be repaid in monthly installments according to the provisions of Article 7 of the settlement regulations. The interest shall be calculated from the date when the depositor comes to exchange for a new passbook and shall be calculated at half of the loan interest rate approved by the Central Bank at the end of the previous month. Before the exchange procedures are completed, or after the exchange, the date for taking money is overdue, and no interest will be calculated for those who do not take the money.

Explanation 1: According to Article 2 of the handling method, deposits and loans before August 13, 1937 shall be calculated by doubling according to the regulations in the attached table of the settlement regulations, that is, the sum of the principal and interest of each yuan is 3,405.924 yuan, which is derived from the formula 1+ (1703.462-7) x 2. According to Article 2 of the settlement regulations: "The principal part of pre-war deposits and loans shall be paid according to the currency amount stipulated in the original contract without any increase or decrease", in the sum of principal and interest of 1703.462 yuan, the principal of 1 yuan should be subtracted and then doubled.

Explanation 2: The trust funds mentioned in Article 3, paragraph 10 of the handling method refer to the funds entrusted by the entruster to be invested or used on their behalf. Ordinary trust deposits shall be settled by multiples according to Article 1 of the settlement regulations.

### "Mothers-in-law Shouldn't Just Look at Appearances When Assessing a Son-in-Law; Request a Health Certificate Rather Than a Diamond Ring" Pre-Marriage Examination

— Wang Juerong

I remember during the War of Resistance, one evening, a young woman introduced her brother to me for a medical consultation. Upon examination, I discovered that this young man had a severe sexually transmitted disease. I gave him an injection, prescribed some pills and a medicinal solution, explained how to use them, and offered him some moral advice. At that moment, he suddenly asked me:

"Doctor, is there any way you can make me better by tomorrow!"

"How could it be that fast?" I replied. "You'll need to come for several more consultations until you're completely cured!"

"But," he hurriedly said, "I have to return to Songjiang tomorrow because the day after tomorrow is my wedding day!"

"What?" I asked in surprise. "You're getting married the day after tomorrow? You absolutely cannot get married before your sexually transmitted disease is cured! You will transmit this terrible disease to your wife, and perhaps to your children. This is not child's play!"

"What can I do?" he said, very distressed. "Everything is prepared, the invitations have been sent, postponing is impossible!"

After an hour of explanation and earnest advice, he finally agreed to find a way to postpone the wedding. After he left, though I had lost an hour of my time, the inner satisfaction made me very happy!

The next day, he didn't come. I assumed he had gone back to postpone the wedding. The third day, and for a long time after, he never came again, and I gradually forgot about the matter.

Three or four months later, the young woman introduced a young wife to me for a consultation, and on the introduction card, she wrote: "This is my new sister-in-law. She's been married for less than four months. She came from Songjiang and asked me to recommend a doctor, so I'm introducing her to you..." I then remembered the young man from four months ago. After inquiring, I learned that the young man's wedding had not been postponed. I began to worry about whether this young wife had unfortunately been infected.

After various examinations, the Wassermann test and Kahn test were both positive, and the Zonbeck early pregnancy diagnosis reaction in her urine was also positive! Clearly, she had been infected with her husband's terrible disease and was pregnant. I began to worry about this innocent child!

My assistant in the clinic, having been involved in the work, knew the whole story in detail. After the young wife left, she began to curse the young man's misconduct, which had caused the young wife and child to be burdened with an indelible disease.

Of course, I deeply regretted that the young man had not heeded my advice and had reaped such a bitter fruit. However, I didn't entirely agree with my assistant's placing all the blame on the young man. I believed that the health administrative authorities should bear considerable responsibility.

Why? Because in China, a "compulsory pre-marital health examination system" has not been established to this day. Because of this, countless innocent young wives are infected with sexually transmitted diseases soon after their marriage! Of course, more babies are aborted due to infection, and those who are fortunate enough to be born are also infected with terrible diseases because of their fathers!

In advanced countries around the world, a compulsory pre-marital health examination system has been in place for years. Not only has it made a great contribution to eugenics, but it has also had a greater effect on the health of the entire nation and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases!

Why hasn't our country, which is ridiculed as the "Sick Man of East Asia," established this excellent system as soon as possible?

In March of this year, at the invitation of the Chinese YMCA, the author and brothers Huang Jiayin and Wu Yuantai held a "Systematic Lecture on Marriage Problems" in the hall of the association. The author repeatedly mentioned the importance of pre-marital health examinations and urged the highest health administrative authorities to pay attention! In September of the same year, at the invitation of the Shen Bao newspaper, the author publicly appealed to the public to pay attention to this issue in two special weekly broadcasts on various radio stations. On one occasion, when the author gave a public lecture at the "Happy Family Society," he also asked the ladies who are about to become "mothers-in-law" not to just find the "son-in-law more and more interesting the more the mother-in-law looks at him," only paying attention to the son-in-law's appearance, but not valuing health examinations. Later, at the invitation of a certain girls' school, I also asked the young ladies that instead of demanding "diamond rings or gray overcoats," it would be more worthwhile to request a health examination certificate of even greater value. Health is priceless, and children are symbols of family happiness! If you have diamond rings and overcoats but lose your health and adorable little angels, will you not regret it?

Recently, I heard that the municipal health bureau is paying attention to this issue, but the public is not only not interested in it, but a few newspapers have published manuscripts ridiculing this new movement. I am therefore using my pen to write this manuscript to explain this movement, hoping to attract the attention of the public. The future of national health depends on the promotion of this movement! I also ask the health authorities to pay attention to broad publicity, and to submit the plan to the Ministry of Health, and then to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan, to complete the legislative process, so that it can be enforced simultaneously throughout the country.

### Defense Against Pulmonary Tuberculosis (II)

— Yu Zhengxing

1.  Relationship with Constitution: Before the discovery of the tuberculosis bacillus, the infectiousness of tuberculosis was not fully substantiated, so personal factors were given considerable importance. Today, it has been completely clarified that it is purely an infectious disease, and the relationship with constitution is no longer important. However, tuberculosis easily becomes a family disease, and there are other reasons besides infection and immunity. Therefore, today, constitution refers to the combination of physical condition (including asthenic constitution and scrofulous constitution), congenital placental infection, and other inducing factors.

2.  Relationship with Environment: The influence of the environment on those who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis is very great. Overwork, malnutrition, or mental and psychological unhappiness, and constant depression, all make it easy to contract pulmonary tuberculosis.

The Incidence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and the Economy: In Europe, pulmonary tuberculosis is called "the disease of the poor." Poor people work hard all day long, live in hardship, and are limited by their economic ability, resulting in malnutrition, thus increasing the factors of infection with pulmonary tuberculosis. According to Hamburg statistics: among those with an annual income of 900-1200 marks, 90 people die out of 10,000. Among those with an annual income of 10,000-0000 marks, 7.4 people die per 10,000. It can be seen that the incidence rate is inversely proportional to economic status. Because after infection, they cannot afford medical treatment, the mortality rate naturally increases accordingly.

The Incidence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Occupation: Infection varies depending on the occupation. Among all occupations, those that produce dust (such as stonemasons, 90%; metalworkers, 73.7%; and miners, etc.) and those who have frequent opportunities to come into contact with patients (such as hotel waiters, barbers, and bathhouse workers) are most likely to contract pulmonary tuberculosis. The second most susceptible are those who work indoors at desks (such as clerks, typists, telegraphers, seamstresses, shoemakers, etc.). Because they exercise less and do not get enough sunlight, resulting in weak physical resistance, they are also prone to the disease. As for manual laborers (such as workers, porters, and farmers, etc.), if the heavy exercise is not prolonged or very rapid, and there is sufficient sunlight, and if the nutrition is good, their incidence rate is lower.

### Do You Believe in Zombies? Do You Believe in Ghosts?

— Qiao Xia Ke

Scientific medical knowledge and scientific hygiene knowledge don't mean just rattling off some new terms—or perhaps semi-old or already old terms—like vitamins, hormones, etc., until you can say them fluently. If "being able to say them" counted, then wouldn't those Donghong gentlemen who wrote stereotyped essays also claim to be speaking for the sages, "establishing words"? But in the end, it's still just a stereotyped essay. Those who can say "vitamins" and "hormones," if they "stop at just being able to say them," could very well turn into vitamin clichés and hormone clichés, which are what we call "foreign clichés." Who would want to degenerate to the status of a cliché? How can we avoid such degeneration? We must build a foundation on belief that can prevent corruption, and this foundation can be called the realm of freedom of belief.

I'm not talking about vitamins, I'm not talking about hormones, but I'm talking about—even now, there are so many people who are so happy to talk about, and so many people who are so happy to listen to—ghosts and zombies. Of course, this column is not a *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*; we certainly can't talk about them in the style of *Strange Tales*. And it's not Hu Shi's or Chen Duxiu's collected works either; there's no need to quote what they said, what they said about the existence or non-existence of ghosts; although what they said about the existence or non-existence of ghosts is still very worthwhile to read now.

Do you believe in ghosts? No matter how you answer, whether affirmative, negative, affirmative but uncertain, negative but uncertain, or uncertain whether to affirm or deny, good, it's always your freedom, freedom of belief. This freedom is permissible; we might as well call it freedom within the scope. Why is it permissible? Because those who believe in ghosts cannot prove their existence, and those who don't believe in ghosts cannot prove their non-existence, so we can only let everyone do as they please, and there's no way to force them. As for the records of ghosts in novels and the ghost legends of the elders, no matter how vivid and lifelike they are, if they cannot be performed on the spot at an appointed time, they cannot stand on scientific grounds. Ghost photos and ghost tricks, the "scientific ghost performances" of famous people at home and abroad, are still just jokes (or, to be polite, still just questions).

Do you believe in zombies, ladies and gentlemen? Here, freedom of belief is not allowed; there is only one answer: zombies cannot exist! Of course, the definition of a zombie must be stated: after a person dies, is put in a coffin, and after a certain number of years, the corpse will jump out (everyone says in unison that zombies can only jump, not walk), chasing people, grabbing people, hurting people, and eating people. —Have you ever seen a dead mosquito or dead fly turn into a zombie mosquito or zombie fly, jumping and hopping? If an insect expert could create mosquito zombies or fly zombies, that would be equivalent to bringing the dead back to life. Ladies and gentlemen, here, "dead" means truly dead, because the revival of a false death is not surprising. Ladies and gentlemen, I suppose turning into a zombie is revival, which is completely correct. Because a zombie can jump, and jumping is exercise physiology, which at least proves that the muscle cells are alive. However, turning a dead, truly dead cell back to life is currently impossible—if it were possible, how happy we would be! Bringing the dead back to life, bringing back to life those who have been dead, truly dead, and dead for a long time, is currently an impossible thing, a thing that remains unsuccessful despite strenuous research. Therefore, one cannot believe in zombies, one cannot believe in the stories of Chenzhou talismans driving corpses back to their hometowns. If you insist on believing, although it is your freedom, it should be called freedom outside the scope, which is not allowed on scientific grounds. Why is it not allowed? Because those who believe cannot prove their existence, and those who do not believe have already proven their non-existence.

Under the same name of superstition, there is freedom to believe in ghosts but no freedom to believe in zombies. Under the same name of science, can you casually believe or not believe? Can you have freedom of belief that does not abide by the scope?

### Symptoms of Vitamin B2 Deficiency

— Liang Junqing

We internists or pediatricians often encounter parents bringing their children to seek medical treatment for symptoms such as a sallow and emaciated complexion, sores at the corners of the mouth, and stunted growth. Of course, this is a symptom, not a disease, because many diseases have similar symptoms, and we cannot casually say that they are suffering from a certain disease. However, experience tells us that if we treat it as chronic tuberculosis, that is wrong. If we say that it is pernicious anemia, that is also wrong. If we say that it is just an ordinary chronic stomatitis, accompanied by chronic anemia, or that they are suffering from intestinal parasitic diseases (such as roundworms), and that as long as we cure the local stomatitis, or cure the chronic anemia, or cure the intestinal parasites, these symptoms will disappear, that is also wrong. Because according to this method of treatment, these symptoms will never disappear. Why? Because they are suffering from vitamin B2 deficiency. If they are not given sufficient vitamin B2, then these symptoms will never disappear. Many parents are sighing over their money, thinking that having money is useless. They buy many tonics for their children to eat, but they never see any effect. Instead, they see their children always having a sallow and emaciated complexion all day long. "This is really frustrating!" In fact, if the medicine is not right for the disease, then no matter how much money you have, it is useless. No matter how many tonics you give them to eat, it is a waste of effort. The vitamin B2 deficiency that I am talking about now is one of them. As long as we can recognize these symptoms and give them treatment and prevention at any time, then children will not get these symptoms. By analogy, do we not need our recognition and prevention at any time for other diseases?

Speaking of vitamin B2, it is a relatively new thing. Although some people had published papers before the War of Resistance, saying that another yellow substance could be separated from vitamin B and that it was an indispensable substance for promoting the growth of young children, not many people knew about it. Since the outbreak of World War II, general medical experts have been working hard on research. They are working for the welfare of mankind. In addition to countless other medical inventions, there have been many great inventions in vitamin research. We don't need to talk about anything else; just take vitamin B2 as an example, there have been more successful studies. Due to space constraints and for the sake of being accessible, we can only briefly introduce it below:

Vitamin B2 (i.e., Lactoflavin) is a water-soluble substance. It is a necessary matrix for promoting the growth of young children. If they lack it, then the development of children will be hindered. It is a yellow, shiny substance. It can be extracted from milk. It is also found in oranges, eggs, and yeast. If young children lack it in nutrition but it is not very severe, then it can cause gastroenteritis, anemia, stomatitis, glossitis, cheilitis, and various skin diseases.

According to a report by Dutch physician Van Creveld, "When the Japanese invaders invaded the Dutch East Indies, many Dutch women and children were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps for three or four years. Initially, the food was barely enough to cope with, but it gradually decreased. If calculated by heat energy, it decreased from about 2,000 calories (Ca 2000 kalorien) to about 1,000 calories. And the most uncomfortable thing was the reduction in meat. Later, in the late stages of the war, they could only fill their stomachs with beans or other grains. If they wanted to find meat, they could only catch frogs and snakes. Subsequently, the Japanese invaders were defeated and surrendered. This group of innocent victims, crowded together, and then suffered from a severe outbreak of measles, resulted in these children and young children all being pale, abnormally anemic, not only having extremely poor nutrition, but also having sores on their lips, inflammation of their tongues, and granular skin diseases all over their bodies (see Figure 3). Although other medicines were used to improve their general nutritional condition, they only recovered their health after taking large amounts of vitamin B2."

Based on the above situation, we can know the severity of vitamin B2 deficiency. And children who generally eat only one or two kinds of food are even more likely to suffer from this disease.

Free Talk

### Sugar Without Sweetness

— Tizhai

Everyone was chatting and suddenly talked about the origin of many things, such as the scholar's four treasures commonly used by us "pen-wielding gentlemen," and occasionally they also talked about printing. The Han Juyan brush was discovered in Ningxia. Its shape is almost like today's steel pen. It consists of four long pieces of wood tied together to form a pen shaft, with the brush head clamped in the middle, generally made of rabbit hair or deer hair. Once it is worn out, it is discarded and reassembled. Thus, we understand the story of Wang Xizhi's great-grandson who wore out his brushes and formed a mound. Paper, of course, came later. The eunuch Cai Lun made it from rags and fishing nets, but it was still rarely used at that time. There are so many Western Han wooden slips, narrow and long, which shows that paper was not yet widely used. This led me to think about why the Han Li script tends to be flat and has such a hook at the end, the so-called "silkworm head and wild goose tail." It is probably because the space on the bamboo slips was limited, so it was necessary to use a shoulder-like body to accommodate more characters, and the formation of the tail hook was also closely related to the brush and ink. The reason is very simple; there is no need to say anything cloudy and foggy to deceive later generations and leave them in confusion.

But no one in China writes this kind of book that is both popular and not low-level. When talking about calligraphy, it is always the "Diagram of Brush Techniques," or something like the "Eight Principles of the Character Yong," which leaves you confused. The same is true for everything else. Bernhard Karlgren's Chinese phonetic dictionary immediately uses international phonetics to mark the ancient sounds of Chinese characters, simply and neatly, unlike Chinese scholars who specialize in "oral and auditory learning," from Chen Di, Gu Yanwu, Kong Guangsen, Duan Yucai to Zhang Taiyan and Huang Kan, who only play with the tricks of yin-yang opposition, clear and turbid sounds, causing many university graduates to still regard them as "heavenly books." In the final analysis, they still have to rely on Karlgren's method of marking out the sounds to give later generations a concrete concept. If there are still people in the classroom talking about the four-class sounds of "first-class Hongda, second-class next, third and fourth are all thin, and fourth is especially thin," that is simply confusing. However, what is shameful is that this clear and concrete method was led by foreigners, while writing is our treasure of three thousand years! Does it not make one feel chilled to think about it!

We often feel that Chinese so-called scholars are dedicated to keeping learning inside the door, absolutely not allowing it to "descend to the common people." Even if they put in a lot of effort to understand a small problem, they must make it mysterious and hide it away, saying it in such a magical and unpredictable way that people do not know its underlying meaning. In this way, after half a year or a year, they publish a highly sophisticated and confusing academic paper, creating more labyrinths and more intellectual puzzles. The scholar's status becomes higher, and we become even more unfathomable to them. Unfathomable is almost synonymous with "highly sophisticated" because you do not understand their "treasure of difficult words and shallow knowledge," so you must ask them for advice—if you are determined to get to the bottom of it—then the scholar's airs are put on at this time!

It cannot be said that we have few research institutions, and the money spent amounts to several billions, but what do they show? The common people do not know what these things have to do with them, even though those billions are directly and indirectly drawn from their blood. However, our scholars absolutely do not feel ashamed of this. The writing must be high, the books must be classical, the further away from the real world, the more Nirvana is achieved.

Looking at so many popular science booklets written by foreign scientific experts, I really admire them. Those who study history can write interesting and accurate stories for you, and those who study physics can write down the great principles of the atomic bomb that everyone can easily understand. They are willing to turn what they have digested into vitamins ABCD and then feed them to the ignorant people of the world, instead of eating big fish and big meat and specializing in setting up mazes.

Ilin's "One Hundred Thousand Whys," "Black and White," "Fire Stories," "Indoor Travel," etc., which country does not have a translation of them? The American Popular Science magazine has even better sales. Although we cannot reach that level, we should aspire to it. This is like making sugar, the essential condition is that it has a sweet taste. Sugar without sweetness is just waste. Western medicines all have sugar coatings to reduce our burden of bitterness. Apart from the fact that sugar itself is an important nutrient, this effect should not be underestimated. Our Chinese experts and scholars may be making sugar, but they have forgotten one thing—sweetness!

Who is willing to eat this stuff that tastes like chewing wax?

### New Laundry Detergent

— He Ku

The American Fuyu Oil Company has researched a waterproof compound called Wax Emulsion, which is a boon for both clothing manufacturing and household use.

Putting a small amount of the compound into the wash water, and ironing the clothes after washing, has a waterproof effect and can prevent dust contamination, thereby reducing the number of washes.

This wax emulsion can make the appearance of the material appear more expensive and have a durable feel. Curtains or dresses, after being treated with wax emulsion, can maintain their original style and prolong the life of things like curtains. After each wash, the wax emulsion must be reapplied to regenerate the waterproof power.

The greatest use of this compound is that it can prevent the wrinkling of men's hard collars in the summer.

### Rescuing Refugees

— Jing Wen

These past few days, when I open the newspaper, besides the floods that fill the pages and cause distress upon first glance, what makes one feel that there is still a trace of warmth in the world is the extremely enthusiastic winter relief donations. Many hands make light work, and many a little makes a mickle. From thousands to tens of thousands to hundreds of millions to billions and hundreds of billions, it can be seen that there are still many people who are willing to sympathize with the refugees struggling on the line of death.

However, relief is the most arduous task. Raising large sums of money is indeed troublesome, but how to use the money most appropriately, so that every yuan of legal tender is not wasted, is even more difficult. We must not only give the relief money to genuine refugees, but also strive for speed and seize the time. Winter relief means rescuing refugees from the severe cold to prevent them from dying. If fundraising is slow and distribution is delayed, like "a quick wind meeting a slow doctor," then "distant water cannot quench a fire nearby." It would be sitting idly by as the donations in the bank pile up without being touched, while the merciless cold current waits for no one! By the time spring returns to the earth and the weather turns warm, and the great waters of the West River can no longer save a carp in a dry rut, the large sum of money will have been collected, but the dead cannot be brought back to life, so what good will it do?

"Suffering" is the most abstract noun. No matter how it is explained with words or described with language, it can never be truly conveyed. Just take the two words "hunger and cold." Those who feast and wear sable caps and heavy furs need not be mentioned. Even those who have three coarse meals a day and a tattered cotton quilt or old coat will find it difficult to understand the pain of hunger and cold. Only by personally experiencing two days without food and shivering in the wind and snow in a single-layered jacket can one know that hunger and cold are by no means comparable to missing a bowl of breakfast or wearing one less vest. When the north wind tightens, hundreds of people can die in a single night!

If "death" is "dying in the right place," then one can be spiritually free of guilt. This is what believers generally mean by ascending to heaven and the world of ultimate bliss. Unfortunately, if one could live but cannot, then of course one will "die with eyes that will not close."

We must break the habit of moving at a snail's pace and take the suffering of others as our own. Relief is like fighting a fire, and delay is the most taboo! Otherwise, although I did not kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren died because of me. These refugees who have been pulled back from the gates of hell will still not escape the clutches of freezing and starvation. The refugees will die with eyes that will not close, and how can we be at peace?

Today's Zhongzheng East Road, before Japan launched the Pacific War, was known as Avenue Edward VII. Twenty years before that, it was a creek called the Yangjingbang by the people of Shanghai. The north side of the creek was the British Concession, and the south side was the French Concession. Inns lined both sides of the creek, such as Changfa Inn, Taian Inn, and Fozhao Building. These inns were all located around the Second Yangjing Bridge and the Third Yangjing Bridge. Guests arriving in Shanghai by boat from Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places also disembarked at the bridges. I fear that young people under the age of thirty would not know about this.

### Extraneous Poems of Weng Songchan

— Chen Yixian

Recently, at Brother Zhou Jinjue's place, I saw Wang Pengxin's copy of Zhao Mengfu's "Xiao Xiang Tu" long scroll, which contained a seven-character ancient poem by Weng Tonghe. It was written when he was returning to Beijing from visiting his ancestral graves in Changshu, passing through Shanghai, and waiting for a boat at an inn on the Third Yangjing Bridge. It is not included in his poetry collection, which makes it all the more precious.

The poem was written on the Double Ninth Festival of the Ji Chou year (1889), which was when Tonghe was most favored by the emperor. This can be seen from the line "I am now going to the palace, my mind soaring," and the small note "He entered to give thanks, and was instructed to be cautious about maritime matters." Ten years later, in the Ji Hai year (1899), he added a postscript to the poem, which was one year after Tonghe was dismissed from his official position and returned home after the Wuxu Reform. "Recalling the old events, it is like a dream," which shows his old-age sadness. (When Tonghe was dying, he had a five-character quatrain, "Sixty years of events, desolate until the coffin is closed. I will not shed tears lightly for you." His deceased friend Yuan Boyi praised it enthusiastically.) Now I will record his seven-character ancient poem and postscript on Wang's scroll:

"Writing on the Double Ninth at Yangjingtou,
I cook white fish myself and buy wine from the market.
Leaning against the bright window in a corner of the small building,
Peng Zhitong and Sheng Dalin are on my left and right (referring to two paintings by Wang Hui).
Who is knocking at the door, the guest from Tongjing?
He is alone in his sorrow, pitying my plight.
Pengxin sends me a scroll,
Xiao Xiang becomes a boat in my hand.
The north wind brews cold, the golden chrysanthemums are thin,
Bitter rain connects the beds, the kapok is rotten.
The faint waves are faint, difficult to grasp,
Where can the music of Jun Tian be found?
I thought of visiting Lord Dongting,
But unexpectedly, I meet the Governor of Yongzhou again.
Yongzhou resigned, and now lives in Ezhou,
Watching the stars in front of the Yellow Crane Tower.
Old feelings are vast, I only please myself,
The old brush is strict and not at all careless.
Dong Yuan's painting is originally a wonderful work,
Thousands of imitations, all kinds of ugliness.
Able to transform the plain into the majestic and profound,
Before there was Mi Fu, after there was Dong Yuan.
Yongzhou imitates the ancients without being rigid,
The brush forgets who is who.
The Lingyan Pavilion is open and the lots are drawn,
The Kuaiyu Hall is deep and the windows are startled.
At that time, all the old men praised and admired it,
Let alone leaving it for a hundred years.
I am now going to the palace, my mind soaring,
Still longing for Mount Heng, I turn my head back again and again.
Thousands of words shine, the emperor's grace is heavy (When Tonghe entered to give thanks, he was instructed to be cautious about maritime matters),
A rain is late, the will of heaven is generous.
Meijun flutters along with the jade scepter,
Tracing back to Yuan Lake and Mount Guiju.
The landscape and writing evoke past causes,
Intending to build a lifetime to serve good friends.
Tonight, writing poetry, I am ashamed of its roughness,
The paper is full of dragons and snakes intertwined.
The lamp flowers make flames, the sound of clogs is rare,
Will it be clear tomorrow?"
Postscript: "In the ninth month of the Ji Chou year, waiting for the wind in Shanghai, living alone and bored. At that time, Fang Bomin was about to travel to Hunan, and he held the scroll and asked for an inscription. I casually wrote a poem to ask for his guidance." Another postscript: "In the ninth autumn of the Ji Chou year, I met Fang Bomin in Shanghai. At that time, Bomin was recommended by Shao Zhongcheng to go to Hunan together, but I wanted to visit my sister-in-law in Hunan, and the fake trip was imminent, so I stopped again. Therefore, the meaning of the poem refers to this. Now it has been ten years. Bomin has already retired, and I am also living in seclusion at home. One day, he suddenly visited by boat and brought out this scroll to look at again. Recalling the old events, it is like a dream. End of the fourth month of the Ji Hai year, written by Weng Tonghe, the Layman of Songchan."

### "Little Wild Ambitionist" Imprisoned

— Ke Ming

Casually opening the newspaper, the headline "Little Wild Ambitionist Imprisoned" immediately caught my eye. The content was: "Sixteen-year-old boy Jin Shishan, who used to study at Gezhi Middle School, suddenly last year claimed to be the commander of the Mobile Task Force, privately carved official seals, and privately issued orders..." etc.

Although Jin Baoshan is only a sixteen-year-old boy, his behavior violates the law and should, of course, be punished by law. Imprisonment is a good opportunity for him to reflect and make him realize his mistakes. However, the reasons for his crime need to be analyzed and studied. He himself said: "Because I have always had a desire to be a leader, and I have also been influenced by movies and comic strips," so he did these things. From these few words, we can fully see the morbid state of social education. For the sake of the next generation of citizens, this cannot be ignored.

Currently, what children welcome most, besides games, is comic strips. Teenagers have weak comprehension and are in a period of strong imagination. Legendary stories and strange and bizarre things best meet their needs. And comic strips are full of immortals who ride clouds and drive fog with boundless magic, heroes who fly over walls and move without a trace, demons who are twelve feet tall with eyes like copper bells, and ghosts who scatter beans to form soldiers and summon wind and rain! Therefore, children regard them as the only treasure for after-school entertainment. Despite strict prohibitions in schools, they secretly become even more fond of reading them. The current sales of comic books are so wide and the types are so numerous that they cannot be compared to any other books. Their footprints are all over every corner. No matter how remote the streets and alleys are, as long as there is a place with used book stalls, you can immediately see the red, green, and yellow comic strips, displayed in a dazzling array, attracting large groups of young customers. When children see them, they are so happy that they forget to eat and sleep, and they can't put them down. And illiterate parents even praise their children for studying hard!

As a result, toxins seep into the fragile minds of children and are gradually anesthetized. Over time, "news" such as going to Mount Emei in Sichuan to visit a teacher and Jin Baoshan-like events are staged. In schools, it is common to see elementary school students gesticulating and talking about monster stories, and sometimes when they are happy, they pretend to shout "Wala lala!" or organize armies and call themselves great generals. The reason for this is nothing more than wanting to imitate the freaks in comic strips.

The influence of comic strips is so great, can we no longer stand by and watch?

### Truman's Consulting Physician

— Xu Tonghua

Serving as President Truman's consulting physician, his status and position are no less than those of the "imperial physician" or "Doctor of the Imperial Academy" in the era of autocracy. If the title "Medical Consultant to President Truman" is added to his name card, it will make the recipient of the name card feel awe.

Now, let's talk about the current consulting physician to President Truman, Brigadier General Wallace Graham of the Army. His rank is lower than that of Major General, but above that of Colonel. His responsibility is to take care of the health of President Truman and his family. Usually, this is a relatively leisurely job, with plenty of time to engage in research work in his spare time. However, before President Truman's mother passed away, he had to stay in Washington for a while and rush to Grandview for a while. The two places were thousands of miles apart, which kept him very busy.

Since the death of President Truman's mother, Dr. Graham only needs to pay attention to two patients, namely the President and his daughter, Miss Margaret. Both of them are very healthy. He only needs to take care of their moderate diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise.

Whenever the President travels abroad, Dr. Graham has to check the President's drinking water, vegetables, and various foods, so as not to let bacteria mix into the delicious food prepared. He found that President Truman is an obedient patient. He understands the way to maintain health. He must take a short break after each meal. As soon as he leaves the office, he can leave all matters, big and small, behind him. He can sleep soundly for eight hours at night, and he has a good appetite, although he doesn't eat much. He has no minor ailments.

Dr. Graham is six feet tall, with light brown hair and a slightly bald head. His eyes are blue, and he is thirty-five years old this year. He was a good athlete in his student days and also a scholar. He was born in Harrisonville, Kansas, and studied at the University of Missouri, Central Missouri State Teachers College, Cosgrove University Medical School, and Harvard University Medical School.

After Dr. Graham graduated, he interned in internal medicine and surgery at Kansas City Municipal Hospital, the Cooke Outpatient Hospital, and universities in Vienna, Budapest, and Edinburgh. He participated in medical work during World War II and served in the British theater. He was wounded in the front lines in a certain battle. His father, old Dr. Graham, is an old friend of Harry Truman.

### Burma (Part Two)

— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion

In the midst of the celebrations for Burma's independence, it just so happened that a "Miss Burma," Ma Shengding (a female youth association worker), gave a speech in Beiping. It was very frank and very detailed, and there are many points that can be used as a reference for our people. It is especially wonderful to cross-reference it with a section from Carpenter's "Burma" in her travelogue of Asia. (Although Carpenter's work was published in 18197, many years ago, it still has reference value.)

She said, "Burmese women have a very high position in society. Eighty percent of men nationwide are educated, and forty percent of women are educated. Many women are principals, doctors, police officers, and even bricklayers. The status of men and women is very equal."

This is the actual situation, and it is not something that started today. Carpenter's book also believes that the characteristic of Burmese customs is that "Burmese women's rights are the best in all of Asia." It also says: Japanese women are slaves to their husbands, Chinese women are servants to their mothers-in-law, Korean women cannot go out without carriages, and Siamese women's labor is more burdensome than that of their brothers and they are also a property of the king. Malay women and Indian women and Turkish women are rarely seen on the streets. However, Burmese women, like men, travel freely and do not avoid suspicion. Women have equal property rights with their husbands, and women and men have equal standing in social interactions. There are many female bosses in stores, and female attendants at the counter. Although marriage is not autonomous, the joy of love is free, which is the same as in the New World. Although the law does not prohibit men from taking concubines, families are mostly monogamous, which shows the truth of love.

The above points may not be surprising if compared with the current situation in all of Asia, but at that time, it had not yet undergone the baptism of European and American winds and rains. All parts of Asia were feudal families. Only Burma, without the agitation of new trends, had women's rights on its own, which cannot but be considered a miracle and a characteristic.

Regarding the marriage section, according to "Miss Burma": "It is not very free. When a man takes a fancy to a woman, he must first tell his parents, and then the parents ask the woman's family. If the woman takes the initiative, it is a shame." This is somewhat like the old system in China. Just look at the "Dragon and Phoenix Wedding Invitation" of the old family. The man's parents first send a copy, writing "Respectfully request your golden consent," and the woman's parents reply with an invitation, "Respectfully obey your order," which are necessary words for engagement. Carpenter's travelogue also says that Burmese parents preside over marriages without soliciting the consent of the girls, so there are many elopements. Men and women like each other, become spouses, and establish families on their own, which is also common. Therefore, although Miss Ma Shengding said that Burmese marriage is not free, she also said that she had "been in love," which shows that it has been half "feudal" and half "democratic" for a long time.

On the day of the wedding, eating "rice from the same bowl" is regarded as proof that "they are now husband and wife," which is the same as China's "jiaobei" (intertwined cups). These "remaining styles and remnants" have probably been gradually eliminated or changed in the cultural import from modern civilization.

The Smallness of the World

If you analyze the types of mice, there are so many kinds that it is a sight to behold.

The protruding part on the back of an Arabian camel contains 80% pure fat.

There are thirty-five types of bananas in the Philippines.

One-eighth of the meat in the United States is used to make sausage.

### The Difficulty of Writing

— Wang Baili

Hu Shigang Baocun wrote: "A person in my hometown once went to the market to buy wine, and always complained that it was weak. He asked the person in the store, 'Your wine has enough weight, but why is it weak? Do you mix water in it?' The person in the store said, 'No.' A countryman next to him said, 'You don't mix water in the wine, but you mix wine in the water.' Everyone laughed." These sentences seem quite similar at first glance, but upon careful thought, there is a world of difference between them. Qi Ji's early plum blossom poem says: "In the deep snow of the village ahead, several branches bloomed last night." Zheng Gu said: "Change the word 'several' to 'one,' and it is truly an early plum blossom." Xu then bowed down. This shows the difficulty of using words and sentences. In Han Yu's "Memorial to My Nephew Twelve," there are the sentences "Teach my son and your son, may they succeed; raise my daughter and your daughter, waiting for her to marry." The word "raise" is interpreted as "nourish." This "raise" character is exactly opposite the "teach" character in the previous sentence, and the sentence endings "may they succeed" and "waiting for her to marry" are also opposites. But today's people often misread it as "Teach my son and your son, may they grow up; my daughter and your daughter, waiting for her to marry." Although it can be barely understood in terms of explanation, the syntax of the second sentence is completely gone. This shows that not only is writing difficult, but reading is not easy either.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (43)

Zhu Zhai saw that this sentence had already struck his heart, so he sighed again and said, "I have no complaints now, I only complain that my fate is not good. I want to eradicate this bad luck, and I will fight with my life. Maybe happiness will come in the future. In the past, I was afraid of public opinion, afraid of everyone's gossip, but now I am not afraid of anything! Rather than bury the pain in my heart, I would rather let my will do something. Life is only a few decades long, no need to make myself suffer. My will has completely changed now. I can only plan for my own future, and I don't care about anything else. Let them laugh and scold, I don't care at all. In the past few months, I have suffered unspeakable pain, reaching the extreme! I can't bear it anymore." As Zhu Zhai said this, he seemed to feel something, his eyes reddened, and tears flowed down. Yun Qing had a cold face but a warm heart, and her heart was the softest. Knowing why Zhu Zhai was sad, she couldn't help but shed tears of sympathy, feeling a burst of sadness in her heart. She took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes, saying, "Don't be sad. I think everything will succeed as long as you have the ambition. It is also reasonable for you to be dissatisfied with your wife. Your wife is not bad, but marrying you was a mistake. If she married a businessman, or someone who could be diligent and thrifty, or someone who was mean and calculative, she would definitely be a very good helper, able to help her husband start a business. Marrying you is absolutely incompatible." Zhu Zhai said, "I just can't describe her. No matter how she serves me, I always find her annoying, and I can't talk to her. In such a situation, not only am I in pain, but she is also in pain! I hate that her brain is too old and she doesn't have this concept of divorce. I wish I could ask someone who understands to explain the pros and cons to her, so she would know that divorce is actually beneficial to her." Yun Qing listened and remained silent. Zhu Zhai said, "It's not that I don't have the courage to openly propose a divorce, but because of my father's temper, you know. If things are not handled well and the old man is angered, then my sin will be unforgivable. I have always been tolerant and dared not act out because of this. But if I continue to tolerate it like this, my lifelong happiness will be over!" He kept sighing. Yun Qing said, "Your wife and I can still talk. If I go to persuade her, maybe I can move her. It's just that this matter is too important. On the one hand, it will ruin someone else's marriage, and on the other hand, I'm afraid people will gossip about me, which is very unfavorable to me." Seeing Yun Qing automatically express this intention, Zhu Zhai quickly turned into a smile and said, "If you are willing to speak, it is to save her, and it is also to save me. You love me very much, can't you sacrifice this little bit for me?" Yun Qing's face turned red and said, "What I'm worried about is that I'm afraid people will gossip about me. Everyone knows about our past."
