### Bai Chongxi Reports on Military Suppression of Communists: Ensuring Stability in the Northeast and North China, Communist External Aid in Central China Has Been Cut Off

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] At the Central Memorial Week, Committee Member Bai Chongxi briefly reported on "Recent Communist Military Affairs," stating: (1) "Northeast Front": After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communists attempted to seize the Northeast. At that time, 116,000 personnel were transported to the Northeast by sea from Shandong and by land from Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou. In May of the 35th year (1946), after the National Army captured Sipingjie and Changchun, Lin Biao's Communist forces were demoralized and in disarray. At that time, it would have been possible to pursue the victory and capture Harbin, Manzhouli, and Jiamusi, annihilating all of Lin's forces. However, due to the influence of political negotiations, a ceasefire was implemented, allowing the Communists to spread and grow, leading to the current situation. The Northeast is a shield for North China. To protect North China, the Northeast must be secured. Historically, the Liao, Jin, and Manchu entered the Pass with the Northeast as their base. The Russo-Japanese War was also fought to gain control of the Northeast. Furthermore, the Northeast has a large amount of national defense resources, with an annual output of 3 million tons of iron, 26 million tons of coal, 19 million tons of grain, 3 million kilowatts of electricity, and 12,000 kilometers of railways. Its importance in national defense is self-evident. The General Headquarters attaches great importance to the current military operations to suppress the Communists in the Northeast and will make every effort to ensure the Northeast is secured.

(2) "North China Front": Currently, we still have a military advantage. On one hand, we are ensuring the political and economic center of the Tianjin-Beiping-Baoding triangle area. At the same time, we are developing from points and lines to strive for control of areas, in order to stabilize North China and support the Northeast.

(3) "Northwest Front": Currently, the military strength in the Northwest has an absolute advantage. The Ningxia and Qinghai provinces have a considerable number of cavalry, which are the most effective forces for suppressing bandits in the Northwest. Before the War of Resistance, Xu Xiangqian led a large number of troops to harass western Gansu, and was severely打击 by Qinghai province cavalry, nearly to the point of complete annihilation. Previously, Ma Jiyuan's troops eliminated a Communist regiment in Heshui with a small number of cavalry. Also previously, Ma Hongkui's cavalry in northern Shaanxi relieved the siege of Yulin, demonstrating their effectiveness. Currently, the Communist suppression military affairs in the Northwest only require unified command to eliminate the Communist bandits and consolidate the Northwest.

(4) "Central China Front": Shandong is the main battlefield for suppressing Communist bandits. Since Zhangjiakou was occupied by the National Army, the international route by which the Communists connected to Outer Mongolia has been cut off. Last year, we successively recovered Yantai, Longkou, and the Yimeng Mountain area, destroying the Jiaodong base area. The international maritime traffic through which the Communists obtained external aid has also been cut off, forcing them to flee south, infiltrating the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui in various directions. Liu Bocheng's bandit troops infiltrated the Dabie Mountain area. Chen Yi's bandit troops fled to western Shandong, northern Anhui, and eastern Henan. Chen Guang's bandit troops infiltrated western Henan, all to cover Liu's establishment of a base area in the Dabie Mountains. Tactically, they adopted the "three demands policy," namely demanding soldiers, demanding food, and demanding battles, coercing young men, seizing civilian guns, looting grain, and avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, using large forces to attack small forces, which the Communists call "airborne tactics." However, although the bandits fled south in various directions, their supply of weapons and ammunition is difficult, which is their fatal blow.

(5) "Regarding the Suppression of Communist Bandits in the Dabie Mountain Area": Since August of last year, Liu Bocheng led his First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Columns and the Central Plains Independent Brigade, successively crossing the Yellow River, passing through southwestern Shandong, and infiltrating the border areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan, joining forces with Li Xiannian's Twelfth Column, attempting to establish a military base area in the Dabie Mountain area. After Liu's bandit troops infiltrated the Dabie Mountain area, they looted civilian supplies, coerced young men, and seized grain, while dispatching a large number of village cadres to develop underground organizations, attempting to occupy the area for a long time, and cooperating with the two bandit units of Chen Guang and Chen Yi. Militarily, they attempted to block the Jinpu, Longhai, and southern sections of the Pinghan railways, cut off the waterways of the Yangtze River and the Hangzhou Canal, and waited for an opportunity to cross the Yangtze River to invade Jiangnan, threatening the capital to the east and Wuhan to the west,妄想 to realize their dream of crossing the Yellow River in the 36th year (1947) and the Yangtze River in the 37th year (1948). According to intelligence, the bandit leaders held a meeting in Jingfu, deciding that Liu Bocheng's bandit troops would establish a base area in the Dabie Mountains, Wang Hongkun's bandit troops would infiltrate the Tongbai Mountain area, Li Xiannian's bandit troops would infiltrate and cross the Yangtze River, Chen Geng's bandit troops would harass the Funiu Mountain area, and Chen Yi's bandit troops would conduct mobile operations to coordinate.

In order to crush Liu's attempt to establish a base area in the Dabie Mountains, our Supreme Command ordered me to organize the Jiujiang Command of the Ministry of National Defense, whose task was to break Liu's attempt to establish a base area in the Dabie Mountains, ensure the safety of Nanjing and Wuhan, and maintain the land and water transportation of the Yangtze River (between Nanjing and Hankou), the Pinghan Railway (between Hankou and Xinyang), and the Jinpu Railway (between Tianjin and Bengbu). The operational command range of the Jiujiang Command is south of the Huai River (the line of Bengbu, Zhengyang, Gushi, Xixian, and Xinyang), north of the Yangtze River, east of the Pinghan Railway, and west of the Jinpu Railway, with the Dabie Mountains as the main area, including parts of eastern Hubei, southern Henan, and western Anhui.

### The Communist Suppression Process in the Dabie Mountain Area

Regarding the communist suppression combat progress in the Dabie Mountain area, after November 27th of last year, our troops gradually completed their concentration and began the encirclement. Liu's bandit troops were forced to cross the Ba River to the west and flee to the northwest, attempting to receive reinforcements from the 10th Column moving south from the Huai River. Our various units pressed from the north and south, forming an encirclement of Liu's main force north of Macheng and Zhubu, and south of Guangshan, Pihe, and Xuanhuadian, forming a strategically advantageous situation. Starting in December, Liu's bandit troops were forced to begin a partial centrifugal retreat, attempting to lure our main force to pursue and relieve the siege of their main force. Their deployment was to send the 10th and 12th Columns west to the Pinghan Railway, and two columns northeast to Guangshan, while their main forces, the First, Third, Sixth Columns, and the Independent Brigade, remained in the Dabie Mountains. At that time, the command secretly deployed a large force in the Liulin area in advance. The entire 10th Communist Column and part of the 12th Column, totaling more than 20,000 people, passed through Liulin on December 6th, and were annihilated by our army in a three-day-and-night battle. The number of Communist officers and soldiers killed was 9,325, including 316 officers and 3,562 soldiers. The captured materials included 5,920 rifles, 36 light and heavy machine guns, 16 artillery pieces, 150 horses, and many other military supplies and documents. The main force of the 10th Communist Column was destroyed by our army, and part of the 12th Column was defeated, and most of its combat capability was lost. The second battle was the battle of Queshan. On December 24th of last year, the First Communist Column fled north to Runan. The Third Division under the command of our Zhengzhou Command was frustrated near Xiping in order to coordinate with the defense of Yancheng. After the bandits barely escaped, they used the main forces of the First, Third, Fourth, and Ninth mixed teams, totaling about 70,000 people, to attack the Queshan defenders, our 20th Division, on the evening of December 28th. The division obeyed orders and was determined to hold firm. The command immediately ordered a strong force to Zhao Yue's operational area to rush to the rescue and lift the siege, and dispatched the air force to assist in the battle day and night. The officers and soldiers of our 20th Division fought bravely. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, our reinforcements advanced to the flank and rear of the bandits, in the Zhengyang and Minggang area, forming a strategic situation. The bandits collapsed. In this battle, more than 3,400 Communist officers and soldiers were killed, about 8,000 Communist officers and soldiers were wounded, 358 Communist officers and soldiers were captured, and a large number of military supplies such as heavy machine guns, rifles, and rifles were seized.

The above are the important combat experiences of Communist bandit suppression after the establishment of the Jiujiang Command. Smaller-scale battles are not detailed. Liu Bocheng, known for his cunning, graduated from the Soviet Red Army University and is a military theorist of the Chinese Communist Party. The Soviet Union praised him as one of China's strategists. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, Liu's bandit troops have repeatedly attacked the National Army. First, our 30th, 40th, and New 8th Armies were attacked between Xinxiang and Anyang. Later, in western Shandong, our 55th, 66th, 70th, and 32nd Divisions were successively defeated by them. Also, in eastern Hubei and western Anhui, one brigade each of our 40th, 52nd, and 88th Divisions also suffered setbacks. Liu is now the "Commander of the Central China People's Liberation Army." This time, when he infiltrated the Dabie Mountain area, his force totaled about 110,000 people. Since we began the suppression campaign, our main forces have been defeated in the past three months, with the total number of casualties and prisoners amounting to about one-third. They have now been forced to leave the core of the Dabie Mountains, dispersing into smaller units. This is a victory gained by relying on the virtue of the Supreme Commander and the dedication of the officers and soldiers. This has greatly boosted morale and strengthened confidence, believing that the bandits are not impossible to suppress, but can certainly be eliminated. However, one should not expect quick results. In the past, the war between the Xiang Army and the Taiping Army lasted fifteen years, and the Huai Army took eighteen years to suppress the Nian Rebellion. That is, from the 18th to the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1929-1933), our suppression of Communist bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui also lasted about five years. We are now dividing the areas to clean up this fleeing group of bandits in the Dabie Mountains. We are actively repairing roads, setting up communications, selecting strategic points, building fortifications, and deploying troops to defend them. At the same time, we are actively organizing the masses, leveraging civilian power, and cooperating with the military to eliminate the underground organizations of the Communist bandits. In this way, food, young men, and civilian guns will be controlled by us, and intelligence can also be blockaded, so that the bandits cannot obtain food from the people, coerce young men, or obtain intelligence, which is equivalent to fighting in the dark. We, on the other hand, are always proactive. Given a little time, we will surely be able to eliminate the remaining bandits. (To be continued)

### Air Force Searches Mountain Areas in Southern Henan

Currently, only Sui County and Xiangyang County still have bandits entrenched. As for Zhang Jian's unit between Yuan'an and Jingmen, there are only a thousand or so scattered bandits left, who can easily be wiped out.

The headquarters acknowledged the difficulties, but after receiving some American equipment from our troops stationed in India, it is now on a larger scale. Although warfare has now entered the atomic bomb era, atomic bombs cannot solve the entire battle, so armored forces still occupy an important position. Our country was originally behind other countries in armored forces, but we must catch up and strive to complete the mission of strengthening the suppression of bandits and establishing a new army.

Therefore, it is necessary to gather like-minded friends to analyze China's major problems and grope for a path that may lead to light in the darkness. He also said: "We really want to find a new path, which is neither limited to the paths that have already been taken by people in the country, nor will it easily shift with the evolution of the international situation."

Luo told reporters: (1) The Northeast and North China have become a single battlefield. Without the Northeast, there is no North China. The National Army is determined to make every effort to ensure the Bohai ports and western Liaoning. If the National Army controls the above-mentioned bridgeheads, it can fight the Communists outside the Great Wall and crush their attempt to enter the Pass and threaten Beiping. (2) In the past, the Northeast warlords took into account strategic and resource bases with limited troops, resulting in losing sight of one thing while attending to another. In the future, the troops should be concentrated to consolidate strategic bases, and the troops can be used flexibly. (3) There are no problems with the defense of Shenyang. The Communist bandits in Huaiyin still have an active plan to attack Shenyang. Whether the railway between Jinzhou and Shenyang can be opened depends on the arrival of reinforcements.

It is said that the bandits have harassed Lao Siping, and fierce battles are expected in Siping within days. On the eastern front, Benxi, which was already isolated, is now being approached by most of the Communist 4th and 8th Columns from Yingkou.

### The Death of Flying General Zhu Peifeng; Chiang Wei-kuo Painfully Recalls the Incident

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Zhu Peifeng, Chairman Chiang's nephew, died in an accident on January 12 while piloting a transport plane, 20 miles west of Luoyang. Chairman Chiang was deeply saddened by the news; Zhu's friends were also deeply saddened. It is never easy for the nation to cultivate a talent. Moreover, a young man like Zhu, who was both academically and militarily accomplished and eager to learn, had unlimited potential. Now, he has unfortunately died young. Zhu's cousin, Chiang Wei-kuo, spoke to this newspaper today, still in deep mourning as he recounted Zhu's past. He was saddened by the loss of their friendship and pained by the loss of a talent for the nation. Zhu Peifeng and Chiang Wei-kuo were classmates at Soochow Middle School. After graduation, Wei-kuo continued his studies at Soochow University, while Zhu was admitted to the Civil Engineering Department of National Central University. After graduating from Central University, he went to study in the United Kingdom, specializing in architecture at the University of London and Cambridge University, where he obtained a bachelor's degree. This academic background alone was enough for a young man to develop his ambitions. When the War of Resistance broke out, Zhu happened to be in the United States for inspection. Realizing the severity of the national crisis, he decided to abandon his literary pursuits and join the military. He excelled in mathematics in school, and with this foundation, he studied "celestial navigation" in the United States. After graduating, he formally became a pilot, undergoing basic and advanced training, and then studying bombing. In 1943, he completed his studies and returned to China, serving as an operations staff officer in the Air Force Bombing Brigade with the rank of Second Lieutenant. He was stationed in Hanzhong, Liangshan, and other places, participating in numerous battles. In operations such as bombing Wuhan and bombing the Yellow River Bridge, Zhu flew his iron bird, dropping bombs on enemy construction works, striking the invaders. In 1944, he was sent to the United States to attend the Air Force Staff Class at the Staff College. After the victory of the War of Resistance, most of the personnel of the Bombing Brigade were reassigned to the Second Air Transport Brigade. He switched from bombing to transport, still serving as an operations staff officer, but by this time his rank had risen to Captain.

Soldiers originally dedicate themselves to the nation, and airmen are even more dangerous due to the nature of their duties. When they decide to become air warriors, they put life and death aside. Zhu Peifeng participated in air force operations for several years, braving dangers and escaping perilous situations several times, without diminishing his spirit. This time, however, it was an accident. In early January, he was ordered to transport gasoline from Xuzhou to Xi'an, arriving safely. On January 12, they flew back to Xuzhou from Xi'an in the same plane, with a total of six people on board, with no passengers or cargo. Suddenly, they discovered a serious malfunction in the plane. According to regulations, they could have abandoned the plane and parachuted, but Zhu Peifeng, in order to save the nation an airplane, tried to make an emergency landing. This was over the skies west of Luoyang. As they slowly descended, only two or three hundred feet above the ground, the plane suddenly caught fire and exploded. All six people on board, Zhu Peifeng, the co-pilot, two mechanics, and two communications officers, were all killed.

To not die in the airfields of the War of Resistance against Japan or suppressing bandits, but to die during routine transport flights, is somewhat regrettable for a warrior. But even more regrettable are the warrior's elderly father, mother, and young daughter. Peifeng's father is Mr. Zhu Zhishan, currently the Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications. His mother was Chairman Chiang's younger sister, who died early. He was an only son, with no siblings, and was raised by Chairman Chiang from a young age. The Chairman had a special fondness for him. In order to save the nation from danger, he did not choose a safe job, but instead threw himself into the battlefield. It was not until December 25, 1945, that he married Miss Yang Yuwen in Chongqing. Miss Yang is the third daughter of Chairman Yang Sen of Guizhou. The couple had a very loving relationship after their marriage and had a daughter, who is now less than a year old. After Peifeng's accident, the elderly parents and the widow were overwhelmed with grief. The remains have now been sent back to Zhu's ancestral home in Fenghua County by Miss Yang. The family still lives in Shanghai. The absence of a central figure in this family makes their desolate situation imaginable.

When Chiang Wei-kuo described Zhu Peifeng's personality to the reporter, he especially pointed out that Zhu usually enjoyed sitting quietly and thinking deeply, and had profound insights into all issues. When he was active, he was intensely active. He was good at both basketball and tennis. At Cambridge University, he was a member of the school's tennis team! Zhu was extremely sincere to his friends and extremely responsible in his duties, never uttering a word of complaint. Chiang Wei-kuo said, "The death of my cousin Peifeng is a great shock to me, but also a great encouragement. My brothers and I are all working in the military. He was in the Air Force, and I am in the Army. Now he has unfortunately died! I think only by doubling my efforts can I make up for the loss of his death!"

Editorial

### Face the Problem of Factory Raw Materials!

Most of the second-category goods listed in the Provisional Measures for the Amendment of Import and Export Trade are industrial raw materials. Since the first quota was announced on February 18 of last year, five rounds have been conducted up to February 20 of this year (the fifth and sixth quarters were announced together). The figures are as follows:

First Quarter $99,675,000 USD

Second Quarter $72,610,000 USD

Third Quarter $67,873,000 USD

Fourth Quarter $53,393,000 USD

Fifth and Sixth Quarters $73,476,000 USD

The average figure for the fifth and sixth quarters is $36,738,000 USD. It can be seen that the quota is gradually decreasing each quarter. The recent two quarters are less than 37% of the first quarter. Although the authorities claimed at the time of the first announcement that the quotas for second-category goods were mostly determined based on the average import value of the three years before the war, the domestic production situation and the possibility of domestic substitutes were also considered. However, as the quotas decrease each quarter, and foreign prices increase with time, and as the communist bandits disrupt more and more areas, hindering the source of domestic substitutes such as cotton, wool, and wheat, a general shortage of industrial raw materials is inevitable. When the second quota was announced, the Transportation Control Committee already frankly admitted that the quota was known to be insufficient compared to the needs of production. Now the permitted import quota has been reduced by half compared to that time, making the situation of being stretched and barely able to cope even more imaginable. Therefore, the match, woolen textile, and rubber industries have successively requested an increase in the quota, and the textile industry is particularly concerned about the limited cotton reserves. As for general manufacturers, with limited resources, disputes have arisen over the allocation of resources between industrial associations and import associations, between old members and new members, and between region A and regions B and C. Labor disputes involving reduced wages and layoffs have emerged endlessly over the past year, with the lack of raw materials being a major reason. On the other hand, scarcity has made goods expensive, leading to hoarding and speculation, resulting in an increasingly rampant black market. After factories are allocated raw materials, they often sell them privately for profit, as the profit from manufacturing is less and easier than reselling the raw materials, reducing the incentive to produce. In addition to fictitious companies, there is now a new type of fictitious factory that specializes in competing for allocations and reselling for profit. Legitimate manufacturers engaged in production are forced to seek raw materials on the black market or through smuggling to barely maintain their production. As a result, the black market is thriving, and smuggling is becoming more prevalent.

If these phenomena were merely disturbances and chaos, it might be possible to endure them for a while, waiting for the situation to improve. As the Labor Control Committee said, only when the trade situation gradually improves can the needs of all parties be reasonably adjusted. Unfortunately, raw materials are indeed insufficient, and production will be interrupted. This is not just an industrial problem, but an overall economic problem, and not just an economic problem, but it will affect the entire social and security problem. According to official statistics, from the victory in August 1945 to the end of last year, the municipal labor-management dispute cases totaled 3,877, of which 1,652 were related to employment or dismissal, accounting for approximately 43%. In the past year (1947), the number of such dispute cases exceeded the total of the previous sixteen months. This proves that the number of layoffs by businesses is increasing with time, and the unemployment situation is indeed becoming more serious.

How should this problem be solved? The most ideal solution, of course, would be to open up foreign exchange and allow foreign raw materials to be imported freely, which would provide a continuous supply. However, this is impossible in reality and not permitted by the current trade policy. Secondly, it is to dredge local products and transport them from production areas to industrial areas to supplement some of the needs. This is something everyone should work together on, but it also depends on the domestic military and transportation situation. Therefore, we believe that the only thing we can focus on at present is to strive to absorb remittances from overseas Chinese and promote exports. This is the only way to obtain foreign exchange funds and the only way to exchange for raw materials to maintain production. The key is whether the import-export chain system can be implemented and whether goods with self-provided foreign exchange can be allowed to be imported. If these two things are allowed, then the above problem can be easily solved.

Although opinions differ on how much overseas deposits Chinese people have abroad, since methods such as borrowing have been repeatedly announced by the government and have diplomatic difficulties, apart from guiding them to freely flow into the country through methods such as running businesses and investing, there is no other way to attract them. Outside of the current foreign exchange management methods, if overseas remittances are required to flow entirely into the country without spilling over elsewhere, then apart from guiding them to freely flow into the country through methods such as running businesses and investing, there is no other way to attract them. We really don't understand what policy the government is adopting. On one hand, it is stingy with funds and claims to welcome foreign investment, while on the other hand, it is deeply closed and refuses to allow Chinese people's own foreign exchange to return to the country? What reasons do these officials hold? If it is said that unrestricted foreign goods would be like dumping and would endanger national industries, then the import and export management measures are in place, and it should not be difficult to strictly limit the types of goods. If it is because smuggling is difficult to prevent, then smuggling is rampant now, and the state has not therefore completely cut off legitimate import and export. We guess that their biggest reason is nothing more than preventing the black market for foreign exchange and avoiding stimulating prices. In fact, the black market for foreign exchange has never disappeared during the war and after the war, and there are many factors that stimulate prices, so it will not stabilize because of this. Conversely, the influx of necessary foreign goods and the abundance of materials may temporarily achieve the effect of moderating prices. This can be supported by the fact that prices were relatively stable during the time of President Song.

The above reasons can also be applied to the import-export linkage system. Because the reason why this system has been delayed is said to be due to these concerns. Otherwise, the exchange of import and export should be allowed, not just barter, which does not conflict with the government's current trade policy. Moreover, the disadvantages of export trade are borne by the importers themselves, which can be used to promote exports. Foreign raw materials come in continuously without consuming foreign exchange, which is also beneficial for the government. If imports are excessive or violate prohibitions, they can be restricted according to law. These measures are what is called killing several birds with one stone, so why is the government not happy to do it?

Some say that after importers collect local goods for export, the government will have no foreign exchange to obtain, which must be seriously considered. We don't know if after the import and export linkage, the purchase of local goods will be allowed to importers as a monopoly. Since merchants can purchase and transport exports, why can't the government divide the channels and advance together? Moreover, in addition to this fund, the government has its own sources of foreign exchange, such as loans, barter, and various loans. On the export side, although a sum of funds is divided, on the import side, a burden is equally saved. The result is an increase in exports, an inflow of foreign capital (including overseas remittances and overseas deposits), development of production, and increased tax revenue, with no actual loss.

In short, whether raw materials can be supplied is not just a matter of the interests of a few manufacturers, but it is related to the nation's lifeline. Therefore, whether import and export should be allowed to be linked, whether self-provided foreign exchange should be allowed for import, and how to promote export goods and absorb overseas remittances are all technical issues. Although we have no preconceptions, to maintain the national economy, we must maintain the national industry, and to maintain the national industry, we must maintain sufficient raw materials. This is a very obvious principle. The current state of raw material panic and anxiety, as well as the atmosphere of capital flight and factory relocation, should not be ignored by anyone concerned about the national economy and the people's livelihood, especially the responsible authorities. Moreover, according to the fifth and sixth quota lists, a certain number of cars are still allowed to be imported, but no foreign exchange is given. This clearly leaves a way for self-provided foreign exchange to be used for importing goods. Why is this way only allowed to be applied to car imports and not allowed for factories to follow suit? Is it because most car dealers are foreign merchants, so a convenient door is opened for them? This is especially difficult to understand!

### Fundraising for Children's Relief Fund; Draft Agreement Prepared

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] White Les, Deputy Representative of the Far East Fundraising for the United Nations Children's Relief Fund, is currently negotiating with the Chinese government to sign an agreement on fundraising for the Children's Relief Fund. The draft agreement has now been prepared and will be submitted to the first regular meeting of the Chinese Committee on the 2nd for preliminary discussion.

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] The United Nations Headquarters recently received a telegram from Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, guaranteeing full support for the United Nations' global appeal for people to donate one day's income to relieve refugee children around the world. Similar telegrams have arrived in the capitals of various countries. At the same time, the Planning Committee of the United Nations Children's Emergency Relief Fund held a meeting today to discuss the report of its representative to China. The report recommended that the emergency aid to China approved by the Committee at its last meeting should be shipped immediately. Of the US$3.5 million temporarily allocated for relief in China, US$1 million is for immediate relief.

### Talks with Petition Delegation from the Northeast

(Continued from page 1) "Our delegation, entrusted by all the people of the Northeast and authorized by the Northeast Bureau, represents the Northeast to petition in the capital. Bi Yiyu, Speaker of the Jilin Provincial Assembly, and Lin Lanshan, Speaker of the Liaobei Provincial Assembly, originally agreed to come together, but due to transportation obstacles between Changchun and Siping, they traveled slowly. Subsequently, the Jilin Provincial Fellow Townsmen Association in Shenyang recommended Mr. Tian Yushi to represent the people of Jilin and Changchun to go to Beijing together to petition. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the 27th of last month, but it was delayed due to aircraft problems and only arrived in Shanghai recently. Regarding the seriousness of the situation in the Northeast and the way to save it, fellow countrymen and elders from the Northeast in Beijing and Shanghai have made clear representations to all parties. If a large army can be immediately reinforced, it can be saved. If it is delayed any longer, it will inevitably be lost, and it will be difficult to recover for a hundred years, not only endangering North China but also shaking the foundation of the country, and world peace will also suffer a more serious threat. Just as our delegation was leaving Shenyang on its way south, we learned that the war situation in the Northeast was deteriorating and that the Central Government was about to send reinforcements, but the timing was urgent, and we must race against time and see the facts to be effective. Our delegation will take the night train tonight to go to Beijing to meet with the Chairman and relevant authorities and discuss everything with all parties. Shanghai is the center of public opinion in our country. We hope that fellow countrymen and the press will provide more assistance to awaken the people's attention to the situation in the Northeast, so as to unite our efforts and overcome difficulties together. This is what we hope for."

### Vice Chairman Sun's Remarks in Taiwan

Regarding the Distortion of Reports by American Reporters, It is Considered Necessary to Refute Solemnly

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 1st] Vice Chairman Sun met with reporters at the Provincial Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM today. According to his remarks, in the past, a few American journalists came to Taiwan and did not interview the government and the council, but only obtained information from one or two people who hated the government, making distorted reports, saying that Taiwanese people hoped to break away from China and be placed under trusteeship. This kind of instigation and discord is a propaganda that does not conform to the facts and is purely an international communist conspiracy, which should be solemnly refuted. He went on to say that the technical personnel of our country taking over the industries in Taiwan are not only competent, but also have new improvements and contributions in technology. According to his estimate, it takes about US$100 million to revive Taiwan. If detailed methods are prepared, this fund can be borrowed from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Regarding the National Assembly meeting, he believes that it will not be postponed. Finally, regarding Sino-Soviet relations, he said that there should be no problems with Sino-Soviet relations, because China has always abided by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, but in the past, the dismantling and relocation of factories in the Northeast, the refusal to allow our army to land in Dalian, and the transfer of weapons captured from the Kwantung Army to the communist bandits are all obvious to everyone, which is regrettable.

### Ship Passenger and Freight Fares Increased by 50% Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] Ship passenger and freight fares were once agreed upon by the shipping industry association and approved by the Ministry of Communications, and were to be increased by 33% starting March 1. However, commodity prices have been fluctuating sharply recently, so that the original proposal can no longer be compensated. The shipping industry association convened an emergency meeting on the 29th and immediately asked the Ministry of Communications for instructions by long-distance telephone. After approval, it was changed to an increase of 50%, which has been implemented since yesterday. The 30% ice river fee for the Shanghai-Tianjin line last winter was canceled at the same time. The Yangtze River shallow water fee is still maintained because it has not yet reached the high water season.

### Taiwan Aluminum Corporation Specializes in Smelting and Rolling Aluminum

Not Related to Aluminum Ore Mining

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs: Taiwan itself does not produce aluminum ore. During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, two aluminum smelting plants were established in Kaohsiung and other places. These plants extracted aluminum oxide from aluminum ore imported from Southeast Asia and China, and then smelted it into aluminum ingots, without rolling any aluminum products. After China took over these factories, they were operated by the National Resources Commission. One of the factories was heavily bombed during the war. It was decided to first operate the Kaohsiung factory, which is now the Taiwan Aluminum Corporation. Its original equipment can produce approximately 30,000 tons of aluminum oxide and over 10,000 tons of aluminum ingots annually. The company previously entered into a joint venture with the American Reynolds Metals Company, specializing in smelting and rolling aluminum, and is not involved in the business of aluminum ore mining.

### Dozens of Overseas Chinese Peddlers in Manila Still Permitted to Operate

Legal regulations stipulate that if no Filipinos apply to set up stalls, foreigners may fill the vacancies.

### Three Japanese Nationals Sentenced to Hanging for Torturing and Killing Chinese Laborers and Prisoners of War

[Central News Agency Yokohama Dispatch, 1st] The Sino-American Joint Military Tribunal today sentenced three Japanese nationals to hanging for torturing and killing 431 Chinese laborers and prisoners of war. In addition, three others were sentenced for mistreating prisoners of war and laborers, one to life imprisonment, two to 20 years of imprisonment with hard labor, and one was acquitted. All seven were tried by the Tribunal at the Yokohama Military Court on charges of mistreating prisoners of war and forced laborers at the Nakayama Labor Camp in Akita Prefecture. The trial lasted for three months. The prosecutor presented evidence that 431 of the 981 Chinese laborers died within a ten-month period due to mistreatment and malnutrition. The laborers included prisoners of war who were transported from Qingdao via Japan between 1944 and 1945 to work as miners in copper and coal mines. Before the Japanese surrender, there were a total of 43 Chinese laborer concentration camps. The mortality rate at the Nakayama camp was 42%, ranking third. The highest mortality rate was at the Shizuku camp, where 52% of the Chinese laborers died from starvation and mistreatment within a year. The three Japanese nationals sentenced to death today were all guards at the Nakayama camp who frequently and cruelly mistreated the Chinese laborers.

### Vandenberg Attends Senate Debate Defends Aid to Europe Amount Not to be Reduced Aid to China and Greece-Turkey Cases Soon to be Submitted for Review US House Foreign Affairs Committee Demands Leadership of the World in Resisting Communism

[Our Newspaper Report] New York Radio Dispatch, 1st: Washington News, Senate Chairman Vandenberg today strongly urged the Senate to pass the European Recovery Program, believing that this effort is sufficient to prevent the outbreak of a third world war and become a turning point in the history of the next century. This legislation aims to seek peace and stability for the free people of the free world. He argued that the cost of the first year of the aid to Europe plan is 5.3 billion US dollars and should not be reduced, because reducing it will reduce the possibility of its success. All things should be thoroughly sought, and we should not hesitate. The Soviet Union's obstruction makes the future of the aid to Europe plan somewhat obstructed, but the United States must do its best to rescue the world from danger. Vandenberg also stated that the United States also has a responsibility to provide assistance to Latin America, China, and Greece and Turkey, which must be discussed in this session of Congress.

[Reuters London Dispatch, 1st] Well-informed sources in the United States stated: The United States can approve the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe by the end of this month. The Senate and House of Representatives will finally pass the bill within four weeks, but if the plan is passed on March 31, the shipment of materials from the United States to Europe will be several months later. At the same time, authoritative sources here expect that the review of British economic policy in early March will change its basis due to the imminent implementation of the Marshall Plan.

[Central News Agency Washington, 29th, United Press] The US House Foreign Affairs Committee recently requested that the United States lead the defense of the "non-communist world" to prevent it from being under the Soviet and European Communist control; otherwise, the United States will face a "violent revolution" throughout the world. The committee issued a lengthy report entitled "The World Strategy and Tactics of Communism." The report believes that the conclusions of Soviet policy are as follows: (1) The Communist Party has one goal, which is world revolution; (2) They believe that this revolution will be a violent revolution; (3) They do not admit that peace can be maintained in the future; they expect another world war. The report stated that when the Communist Party seizes the "extreme democratic group," they use despicable means to use this group to achieve their goals and infiltrate workers' organizations. The chairman of the committee is Bolton, a Republican from Ohio. This report was released on the 100th anniversary of the "Republican Manifesto." The report believes that to prevent global communism, we should do our best to establish economically consolidated groups, led by the United States, including Western Europe, China, the Near East, and the Western Hemisphere.

### French Prime Minister Asks People to Increase Vigilance Firmly Guard the Last Bastion of Europe Financial Measures Fail to Achieve Results Crisis Lurks

[Reuters Lyon, 29th] Prime Minister Schumann recently delivered a speech to the National Committee of the People's Republic, stating that France has fallen behind in military technology and time cannot be lost. He said that France is the last bastion of civilization, and it is not enough to issue a decree to deploy an iron curtain to protect France's safety. There is currently unrest everywhere, and anything can happen at any time. Neither domestic nor foreign affairs can be sure to avoid any development.

We must not be too pessimistic, nor should we speculate arbitrarily. We should pay attention to developments outside the national borders, but we should not judge European affairs solely on the basis of the Soviet Union. We in France should restore the welfare of the country. If we can establish social peace and justice, it will be the most effective opposition to communism. The National Committee of the People's Republic also passed a resolution condemning the coup in Prague, denouncing it as an opposition to democracy and the establishment of a dictatorship by a minority. The National Committee also passed another resolution, supporting Schumann's efforts to revive the French economy and curb rising prices.

[United Press Paris, 1st] Many observers here predict that if the government cannot stabilize prices within fifteen days, the Communist Party will again trigger a strike wave. So far, the financial austerity plan implemented by the Schumann cabinet has failed to curb the rising prices. American and French people alike believe that France's US dollar reserves are being depleted at an increasing rate, and the Marshall Plan will not be implemented until after April 1. I am afraid that distant water cannot put out the nearby fire and cannot save the crisis that will be caused by workers demanding increased wages. This crisis seems to be gradually forming since the beginning of March.

### Italian Prime Minister Criticizes the Communist Party National Radio Staff Strike

[United Press Rome, 29th] President Sperli recently told 20,000 Catholic party members that communism must be defeated in the April election; otherwise, we will not be able to vote in Italy again. These words of Jia are the strongest attacks on the Communist Party in the election campaign. A few hours later, all Italian radio stations were silent because 3,000 technicians had followed the strike order of the Communist Party-controlled union. They demanded fourteen months' salary per year. Jia criticized the Italian Communist Party, saying that it established action teams, just like those who supported the Czech coup. It is said that the Czech incident proves our crisis, but we believe that the incident does not happen in one area but everywhere. He criticized Communist leader Togliatti because Tao protested against Jia's speech, calling it a challenge. He replied that the Czech Republic is an example of what he criticized. Defense Minister Fatkiniti also warned the armed forces that political propaganda is not allowed in the military during the election period.

### Finnish Conservative Party Refuses Soviet Proposal

[Our Newspaper Report] London Radio Dispatch, 1st: Helsinki News, The Finnish Conservative Party announced that the party's members of parliament decided to try to urge the government to reject Stalin's proposal to conclude a Soviet-Finnish military agreement.

[United Press Helsinki, 1st] All major political parties have begun discussing the issue of Soviet Premier Stalin's request to conclude a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and Finland. It is reported that the final decision will be submitted to the President on Wednesday. President Paasikivi met with the leader of the pro-Soviet Social Unity Party, Kurollo, over the weekend. According to well-informed sources, the President supports the signing of the treaty. The executive committee of the People's Democratic Alliance, co-organized by the Communist Party and the Social Unity Party, will also meet tonight to discuss the matter. At that time, Premier Pekkala will attend in person.

[United Press Stockholm, 29th] Finnish Social Democratic Party member of parliament Fagiholm hinted here tonight that recent developments in Finland may lead to a government reorganization. It is said that although the Soviet proposal may not be found to have the major changes that some countries with close agreements with the Soviet Union currently have, the government's reorganization can be imagined as a result of the evolution of the situation.

### Anti-Soviet Leaflets Discovered Rumors Abound in Helsinki

[Reuters Helsinki, 29th] Anti-Soviet and Stalin leaflets were discovered here today. The police are investigating their source. The leaflets stated, "Our country now has only nominal independence. Moscow decides the country's affairs. This situation must be ended quickly. Stalin has never forgotten his wartime promise that the Finns on the ground must be eliminated, and he has begun to implement these promises." There are many rumors here. One said that the Soviet flag has been hung outside the Finnish Congress, but it is actually one of the national flags of various countries hung here for the World Skating Championships. It is also rumored that the Soviet Ambassador to Finland, Lavrentiev, has requested the Finnish authorities to provide a complete list of active Finnish army officers. Officials have not been able to confirm this statement, and a press release may be issued.

### British Newspapers Advocate Taking Action to Prevent the Soviet Union from Expanding Its Influence

[Our Newspaper Report] London Radio Dispatch, 1st: Newspapers here today almost unanimously advocated taking action to prevent the expansion of the Soviet Union. Editorials from the right-wing and left-wing moderates are quite similar. The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" stated, "The United States should make it clear to the Soviet Union that if the Soviet Union takes another step forward in Europe, the atomic bomb will soon land in the Soviet Union." The Labor Party's official newspaper, "Daily Herald," published an editorial entitled "Peace or War," stating, "The Soviet Union's policy is bad and should not be ignored. However, Western European democracies should not be satisfied with anticipating a conflict that is about to come, but should still strive to get the Soviet Union to participate in global cooperation, as stipulated in the United Nations Charter." The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" urged to speed up the promotion of the European Recovery Plan and sign economic and military agreements with the United States.

[Our Newspaper Report] New York Radio Dispatch, 1st: Seoul News, Today, General Hodge, commander of the US military in southern Korea, announced that a general election will be held in the US-occupied area on the 9th of this month, from which it can be seen that the Korean Committee's original plan to hold elections by region has been abandoned.

### Moscow Broadcast North Korea Has Not Established a Government

[Reuters London, 1st] Moscow Radio said that Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Presidium of the North Korean People's Assembly, denied the claim that an independent country had been established in North Korea. Kim pointed out that the news reported by American newspaper reporters that North Korea had established a People's Democratic Republic was a provocative fabrication to conceal the actions of South Korea and its people, as well as the efforts of the US military authorities to separate South Korea from North Korea and build a reactionary government under the protection of the United States.

### US Department of Commerce Announces New Export Regulations

So that American Materials Do Not Flow into Eastern Europe

(2) An export license may be issued for domestic exports in short supply to any foreign country at a "competitive price." If the pricing is too high, a certificate will not be issued. The new regulations aim to support the aid to Europe plan and prevent important American goods from being exported to Eastern Europe under Soviet influence, and to shift the target to Western European countries.

It also said that the change in the US attitude is due to the fear that once Franco falls, a pro-communist regime will take over.

### Chairman of the US State Department Policy Committee Kennan Arrives in Japan to Meet MacArthur Talks May Involve the China Issue

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 1st] Kennan, Chairman of the US State Department Policy Committee, arrived here at 5:15 a.m. today to meet with MacArthur.

Kennan is one of the main policy makers in the US State Department. He is believed to be the author of the famous article "Mr. X", a paper on the Soviet Union that was published in Life magazine. He is also believed to be responsible for a part of the US's more firm policy toward the Soviet Union.

[United Press Tokyo, 1st] Kennan told United Press reporters that his main task is to study the situation in Japan.

### A War Within Ten Years: US Public Opinion Poll

[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] The various events in Czechoslovakia, Palestine, Korea, and other countries have garnered significant attention from newspapers. The diplomatic cloud over Eurasia is growing increasingly dense, but the fear of another world war among American voters has not increased significantly. According to a Gallup poll, the percentage of American voters who believe that the United States will be drawn into another major war within ten years remains the same as in August of last year. In August of last year, 53% of voters surveyed believed that the United States would be drawn into another major war within ten years, while this time, 54% held the same view. The Gallup poll shows that Americans do not believe the Soviet Union's accusations that the United States is instigating war, nor the similar claims made by Wallace, are justified. The survey also shows that the vast majority of those who believe war is inevitable believe that the Soviet Union, not the United States, will be responsible for starting another major war.

### Chiang Ting-fu Addresses Asia at the United Nations

### British Parliament Debates Defense Issues; Conservatives Oppose Troop Reductions

[United Press, London, 29th] Parliament is scheduled to discuss defense issues tomorrow due to the Conservative Party's strong criticism of the Labour government's continued policy of troop reductions. Conservative Deputy Leader Eden will introduce an amendment stating that "the United Kingdom's defense lacks a system of adjustments that is comprehensive and suitable for the times, which is cause for serious concern." A heated debate is anticipated. The government's defense plan stipulates that the total number of national armed forces should be reduced to 716,000 by March 1949. The current troop strength is 940,000, compared to 1,427,000 a year ago. In addition, this year's military expenditure will be reduced from £899 million to £692 million.

### Japanese War Criminal Suzuki Deceived Hu Lin

Claimed to Sympathize with China While Advocating Aggression

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Today, during the trial of war criminals, the prosecution of the Far East International Military Tribunal attacked the credibility and evidentiary value of the testimony of Hu Lin, general manager and publisher of the Ta Kung Pao. The prosecution claimed that Mr. Hu had been deceived by the accused Teiichi Suzuki, and therefore Mr. Hu's testimony was worthless. Hu Lin was the first Chinese representative to testify in defense of the accused Japanese war criminal. He testified by means of a written document, which was submitted as evidence by the defendant's lawyers last December. Hu defended Suzuki, calling him a "friend of China" and expressing great sympathy for the Kuomintang and the Chinese government under the leadership of President Chiang. Hu stated that as early as 1929, Suzuki had advocated that Japan should encourage cooperation between Chairman Chiang and Marshal Zhang Xueliang to unite China, and that Suzuki's attitude toward Sino-Japanese cooperation remained unchanged even when Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated to a serious degree in the final years. Canadian prosecutor Nolan told the military tribunal during the presentation of his individual indictment against Suzuki that Suzuki "deceived" Hu, keeping him unaware of the Japanese army's true policies. The clearly stated goal of the Japanese army was to ultimately dismantle the Kuomintang and completely control China, and Suzuki's so-called sympathy for the Kuomintang and the Chinese government under the leadership of President Chiang was a "ruse."

### Civil War in Yemen; Capital Surrounded

### Czechoslovak Cabinet Convenes Meeting; Discusses Strengthening Domestic Security; Guarantees Implementation of Agricultural Reform Plan

[Reuters, Prague, 1st] The new Czechoslovak cabinet will convene its first meeting tomorrow. The agenda will include studying proposals from the trade union movement and the Communist Farmers' Congress, and a plan to strengthen domestic security.

Prime Minister Gottwald addressed a gathering of 100,000 farmers today, declaring that landholdings of more than 50 hectares would immediately be distributed as property to those who till them. However, he stated that Czechoslovakia would not implement the Soviet system of collective farms.

Gottwald's address was met with cheers from the crowd. Defense Minister Svoboda, who is not affiliated with any party, followed Gottwald and expressed Czechoslovakia's continued loyalty to the Soviet Union and other allies. After his address, he asked the crowd to cheer for President Beneš, which was met with thunderous applause. Agriculture Minister Ďuriš stated that there are currently 6,000 tractors in the country, and after the completion of the two-year plan, this number will increase to 12,000, and after the completion of the five-year plan, it will increase to 35,000. He also said that after the implementation of tax reform, 70% of farmers will be exempt from taxes. The assembly concluded with the singing of the national anthem by the entire crowd.

Masaryk's Remarks

[Reuters, Prague, 29th] Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk, who is not affiliated with any party, met with a French journalist today and gave his first public statement since the political crisis. He said that the Czech nation is fundamentally a democratic nation and will continue to maintain these characteristics. The political crisis was caused by those who held mistaken ideas that they could govern the country without cooperating with or even opposing the Communist Party. The crisis has now been resolved in a democratic and constitutional manner. When asked about his personal role in the crisis, Masaryk stated that he had always acted in concert with the people and would continue to maintain this attitude in the future. He joined the government based on democratic ideals and will continue to serve the new democracy to the best of his ability and as needed. Regarding the German question, Masaryk stated that Czechoslovakia, as a neighbor of Germany, has a deep understanding of the German question. The new government and the entire nation are united in recognizing the dangers of the German question. However, Czechoslovakia is a peace-loving nation and will never allow Europe to be divided into two opposing blocs.

### Motives for the Czechoslovak Coup

Internal Factors Were a More Significant Component

[Reuters, Prague, 29th] Many Western diplomats believe that the Czech crisis was due more to internal factors than to the Soviet Union's eagerness to consolidate its alliance system and acquire territory for future expansion into the West. This view has been clarified by the statements of Czech politicians in recent days and by the declaration of the All-Slavic Committee last week. Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Clementis told a reporter from the French Communist Party newspaper L'Humanité that the first goal of the new Czech foreign policy is to complete its alliance system, especially to conclude a treaty with Poland. The resolution passed at the final meeting of the All-Slavic Committee yesterday also mentioned the need for Slavic countries to conclude firm treaties with Romania and Hungary.

### US Election Predictions

Taft Says Republicans Will Win

Democrats Will Not Support Truman

[United Press, Cleveland, 29th] Senator Taft predicted on the 29th that the Republican Party would easily win the November election because the Democratic Party has been split by a third party, because Southern Democrats have already shown their disloyalty. He also said that Wallace's third party will absorb the votes of the communist left wing, while the Southern states' opposition to President Truman's actions will weaken the Democratic Party.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] A Southern Democratic senator bluntly predicted on the 29th that the Democratic National Convention to be held in Philadelphia in July would not nominate Truman as the presidential candidate. At the same time, Senator Taft believed that Southern senators would use delaying tactics to defeat the president's civil rights plan.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] It was believed by many that Senate President Vandenberg would unexpectedly be nominated by the Republican Party as a presidential candidate. However, he said on the 29th that although he did not intend to have his name removed from the initial list, he had no interest in the matter.

### Hull's Memoirs (37)

Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance, Translated by This Newspaper

Severity Is Not Necessarily a Good Method

In September 1944, when the President decided to meet with Prime Minister Churchill to hold the Second Quebec Conference, he asked me if I would be willing to accompany him. At that time, I was in poor health, and the Dumbarton Oaks Conference was also underway, so I replied that I would like to stay in Washington, but if he needed me, I would be able to break away and go.

Shortly before the conference was to be held, the President was forced to allow Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau to accompany him. Morgenthau and his friends had been drafting a harsh plan for dealing with post-war Germany for some time, and the leaders of those groups concerned about German atrocities demanded that the President allow Morgenthau to go to Quebec to present his plan for dealing with Germany.

The President himself had the view that the German people as a whole should be given a lesson they would never forget. On August 26, 1944, he sent a long memorandum to Secretary of War Stimson, and sent me a copy, in which he objected to the content of the manual prepared by the War Department for guiding the military government officials occupying Germany.

He said, "This book gives the impression that we are going to completely restore Germany, just like the Netherlands and Belgium, and return the German people to their pre-war condition as quickly as possible.

"The most important point is that every German must recognize that Germany has been defeated this time. I do not want them to starve to death, but, for example, if they need more food to keep body and soul together, then we should use the army kitchens to make soup and feed them three times a day. This can keep them completely healthy, and they will remember this experience for the rest of their lives. Whether as a whole or individually, they must clearly recognize the fact that they are a defeated nation so that they will not dare to launch a new war in the future."

Regarding the issue of disposing of the German navy, the President put forward a new idea.

On October 13, he wrote me a memorandum in which he said that he agreed with the Joint Chiefs of Staff's opinion on completely destroying the German navy, but he had a point to add:

He said, "In the past, the so-called destruction meant dragging the ships into the sea and sinking them. I think that sometimes surrendered ships are turned into scrap metal as destruction. I do not agree with sinking tens of millions of tons of steel into the sea as a complete destruction.

"Recently, a new use has been found for these ships. We have used sunken ships as breakwaters to build new ports, both in Italy and on the coast of Normandy. This is a cheaper way to build breakwaters. I think that the United Nations organization should pass the request of that country to use these ships for definite purposes, sinking them on the beach as breakwaters to improve or newly build berthing facilities. Using them for this peaceful purpose is a good idea.

"In this case, the ships should be sunk at the designated location as quickly as possible, and monitored on-site by a subcommittee of the United Nations organization. Once the ships are sunk, it will never be possible to retrieve them and reuse them for war purposes."

On September 1, 1944, Rypins told me that the President wanted to organize a "Cabinet Committee on the German Problem."

The "Cabinet Committee" held its first meeting in my office on September 5, with Hopkins, Morgenthau, and Stimson also in attendance. I presented a memorandum that I and my staff had prepared in advance, dated September 4, which included some preliminary recommendations that the Cabinet Committee might submit to the President.

Secretary Stimson almost completely agreed with this memorandum, except for one point, which was that the German people's standard of living should be lowered to the subsistence level. Secretary Morgenthau also seemed to agree with most of the memorandum, but was unwilling to state it explicitly. Hopkins gave me a short message on September 5, in which he said that he also agreed, except for a few minor reservations on the wording that would not affect the content of the memorandum.

The next day, these people met with the President at the White House. I presented the memorandum of September 4 to the President and said that the other members of the committee had not yet fully agreed, but it could serve as a basis for discussion. Stimson presented a memorandum from the War Department, which was very similar to ours in general. However, Morgenthau presented the harsh original memorandum from the Treasury Department.

The discussion ended without a result. The opinions of the State Department and the War Department were so different from those of the Treasury Department that no further discussions were held.

This was our situation when the Quebec Conference was held on September 11. We had not been able to reach any coordination in terms of opinions. As I said above, Morgenthau induced the President to let him participate in the conference, where he was prepared to present his own extreme plan to the President and the Prime Minister. I asked Ambassador to Canada Atherton to represent us.

Four days after the start of the conference, I received a memorandum from the President dated September 15, which shocked me greatly. This memorandum showed that he and Churchill had largely accepted Morgenthau's opinion. The memorandum said that the President and the Prime Minister felt that the best way to prevent Germany from rearming, one of the key points, was the future disposition of the Ruhr and Saar regions. Germany's rapid and easy conversion of metallurgical, chemical, and electrical industries from peacetime to wartime had given us a very painful lesson. At the same time, we should also remember that Germany had destroyed a large part of the industrial facilities of the Soviet Union and other allied countries, so it was fair that those damaged countries should have the right to remove the machinery they needed to compensate for the losses they had suffered.

The memorandum continued:

"Therefore, the various industries in the Ruhr and Saar regions must be shut down. We feel that these two regions should be entrusted to a country under the world organization, which would supervise the dismantling of these industries, ensuring that they do not reorganize under some disguise."

"The goal of this method of removing war-manufacturing industries from the Ruhr and Saar regions is to transform Germany into a country that is primarily agricultural and pastoral in nature."

"The Prime Minister and the President have expressed their agreement to this method."

In the letter attached to the memorandum, the President said that he was quite satisfied with this. He believed that I would also be able to agree with the general idea of not allowing the Ruhr and Saar regions to revive.

However, I felt that I could not agree with any plan whose "goal was to transform Germany into a country that is primarily agricultural and pastoral in nature." Seven million Germans could not possibly survive on that little bit of German land alone. They would starve to death as a result, and would become a burden on other countries. This strategy would cause Germans to have endless hatred. This would be to punish the entire people and their descendants for the crimes of a few. This would not only punish Germany, but also punish most of Europe.

The President also confirmed in the letter that he thought he had finalized the locations where the troops occupying Germany would be stationed. He had hoped to use northwestern Germany as the American occupation zone, but later agreed with Churchill to have the British occupy it, while the United States would occupy most of the southern regions, including Bavaria.

On September 15, the same day that the President sent me a memorandum including the Morgenthau Plan and the decision on occupation zones, he sent me another memorandum in which he told me that Morgenthau had also presented a plan in Quebec, along with his plan for dealing with Germany, for a $6.5 billion loan to Britain. This seemed like a quid pro quo; the Secretary of the Treasury used this to make Churchill agree with his Draconian method of dealing with Germany.

The President said in the memorandum that he had agreed that Britain could continue to receive $3.5 billion worth of military aid and $3 billion worth of non-military aid from our country while Germany was defeated and the war against Japan was still in progress. He agreed with Churchill's statement that if the United Kingdom was to clear its war debts, then its export trade, which had already been reduced to a minimum, had to be re-established. Of course, materials obtained from the Lend-Lease Act and other similar loans must not be exported or sold for profit, but it was essential that the United States should not attach any conditions to the materials supplied to Britain under the Lend-Lease Act, because otherwise its export trade would be unable to recover.

This struck me like a blow to the waist. This would destroy the negotiations we had been conducting with Britain for three years. This violated Article VII of the Lend-Lease Agreement we signed with Britain in 1942, which stipulated that Britain should adopt a non-discriminatory commercial policy after the war, meaning that it would abolish imperial tariff preferences.

I believe that this entire development in Quebec angered me more than anything else during my entire time as Secretary of State. If this Morgenthau Plan had been leaked, and leaks were inevitable—and it was leaked later—the result would have been that Germany would have fought desperately, causing the United States to lose thousands and tens of thousands more lives.

### Full Rationing Price Decided: $240,000 Per Peck; Mayor Wu and Others Jointly Host Press Conference, Reporting That Proceeds from Rice Sales Will Be Used for Social Relief

[Report from this newspaper] The system of quantitative rice rationing based on household registration certificates in this city was officially implemented yesterday. The ration is one peck of rice per person per month, and the price is set at $240,000 per peck. Ration certificates were issued yesterday. To ensure that citizens fully understand the system, Mayor Wu, the chairman of the Municipal Food Distribution Committee, Pan Guanghui, the representative of the US Aid to China Materials Processing Committee of the Executive Yuan, and Mr. Kirkpatrick and Mr. Payne of the US Aid to China Materials Committee, jointly hosted Chinese and foreign journalists at the city government at 5:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu first explained that the purpose of rice rationing was to stabilize rice prices. In the past, it was not possible to implement this due to concerns about the source of rice. This time, thanks to US aid, we would like to express our gratitude. Then, the Chairman of the Committee reported the detailed arrangements for the rationing, stating that the principle of the full rationing was to be as simple as possible. All citizens, regardless of age, are entitled to one peck of rice per month. To avoid crowding when purchasing rice, the rice ration certificates are divided into two types: one for use in the first half of the month, and one for use in the second half of the month. Rice stores are not designated, and citizens can choose any rice store in their district to purchase rice with their certificates. All rice stores and rice companies in this city are participating in the program, mobilizing more than 2,000 rice stores, more than 200 rice companies, 130 brokers, and more than 300 middlemen. They are all given a profit of 5%. In the future, when citizens go to buy rice, they can compare rice samples and ask for delivery without paying for delivery. Rice ration certificates in this city have been distributed to the district offices starting yesterday, and they are instructed to distribute them to each household within three days. Citizens can then purchase rice with their certificates.

### Factors Determining the Rationing Price: Report by the Mayor

Regarding the determination of the rice rationing price, Mayor Wu reported the following two points: (1) It is calculated based on 95% of the actual price in the free market. (2) The rice price for the next month is determined during the last five days of each month. This month's price is based on yesterday's prices in the free market. Yesterday's market price for top-quality white rice was $2.8 million, plus a 6% profit, which should be $2.968 million. Because US relief rice is 150 catties per dan, while domestic rice is 165 catties per dan, it is discounted by 96%, totaling $2.8419 million. Because the quality of the rationed rice is lower, it is further discounted by 90%, totaling $2.557 million. After another discount of 95%, it is $2.4025 million. For ease of calculation, the price of the rationed rice is determined to be $2.4 million per stone and $240,000 per peck.

### American Representative's Three Points of View

Mr. Kirkpatrick of the China Relief and Material Committee stated: Shanghai is the third largest city in the world, attracting significant international attention, and he hopes the rice rationing system can be successfully implemented as a pilot program. Speaking from the position of an observer, he offered three points: (1) This rationing plan will operate on a four-month cycle.  The rice supply for these four months must be fully stocked, and preparations for the next period's rice supply should be made early. He has already raised this point with the National Government and it has been accepted. (2) The implementation of the rationing plan will treat the five major cities of the country equally. Shanghai is currently managed by a separate organization—the People's Food Allocation Committee—and with the cooperation of the municipal government, success is strongly believed to be attainable. (3) The United States believes that this is the best possible solution under the current overall economic situation in China, and hopes that it can be implemented throughout the country. Following this, Pan Guangjiong of the Executive Yuan's China Relief and Material Processing Committee explained the reasons for selling American relief rice.  According to the Sino-American agreement, this rice must be sold in the five cities, and the proceeds will be used for relief purposes, specifically allocated to social relief and medical hygiene. Therefore, relief is the goal, and rice rationing is merely a tool.

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, did not attend yesterday, but issued a written statement with the following content: (1) He hopes that all citizens of the city will sincerely cooperate with the government. (2) He hopes that the staff will work diligently and honestly. (3) He hopes that all levels of administrative agencies in the city will assist. (4) He hopes for the support of public opinion.

### Only Success Allowed, Failure Not Permitted

Finally, Mayor Wu gave two conclusions, stating: (1) He thanked the United States for providing a large amount of supplies (half of the rice for comprehensive rationing is supplied by the government, and half is supplied by the United States), enabling the rice rationing to be implemented. (2) He declared that the administrative responsibility for rice rationing rests entirely with the municipal government and is unrelated to the US China Relief Committee. Therefore, rice rationing must succeed and cannot fail. Otherwise, the municipal government will face a major crisis. At the beginning of the implementation of the rationing system, he especially called on responsible public officials, rice shops, and all citizens of the city to work together.

### Student Uprising Case Rescheduled for Public Trial

### Important Resolutions of the Assembly of Councillors Abolition of Penalties for Exceeding Electricity Limits The Limit is the Month with the Highest Electricity Consumption in the Last Three Months Those Who Do Not Exceed 40 Degrees Will Still be Standardized at 40 Degrees

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon. In addition to continuing the agenda that was unfinished at the fourth meeting, namely questioning the Civil Affairs, Police Affairs, and Social Affairs Bureaus, and the three directors successively answering, another important proposal on saving electricity was discussed. After discussion by the Assembly, it was resolved to abolish the penalty method for exceeding electricity limits, and citizens were asked to conserve electricity voluntarily for a trial period of six months. The detailed resolutions include five points: (1) Starting from March 1st of this year, citizens are asked to conserve electricity voluntarily, and the Public Utilities Bureau is requested to promptly order all power companies to temporarily suspend penalties on bills based on meter readings from March 1st. (2) The limit for electricity consumption will be the month with the highest electricity consumption in December of last year, January of this year, and February of this year. However, if any of these months (December, January, or February) did not exceed 40 degrees, the limit will still be 40 degrees. (3) For those who exceed the electricity consumption limit, a first warning will be given, a first severe warning will be given, and those who exceed the limit by more than 30% for the third time will be subject to a power outage for one week or less. (4) The above measures will be tested until the end of September of this year, and the results will be reviewed. If there are any problems, further discussions and improvements will be made. (5) The above points will be sent to the Municipal Government for urgent implementation.

Request for the Return of Electrical Machinery

In addition, an incidental resolution was passed: The electrical generator of the Shanghai Chinese Chamber of Commerce Electric Company, which was dismantled by the enemy during the occupation and placed at the Shijingshan site in Beiping, is now in the possession of the North China Iron and Steel Company of the Resources Committee. The Council will specially send a telegram to the Executive Yuan requesting that it order the Committee and relevant agencies to expedite the development, in order to alleviate the electricity shortage in the Nanshi area.

Maintaining the Principle of Electricity Conservation

According to the above resolution, it was based on the revised review opinions of the Public Utilities Group Review Committee after detailed discussions. A total of seven proposals related to electricity conservation were submitted to the Assembly. After being merged, the reason for the case was: "In order to reduce the burden on citizens, a trial abolition of the penalty for exceeding electricity limits is proposed, and citizens are requested to consider the difficulties of electricity supply and strive to save energy." Therefore, Speaker Pan repeatedly stated that although the penalty method has been resolved to be abolished, the principle of electricity conservation should still be maintained, and he hopes that citizens will voluntarily conserve electricity. On the one hand, it can also test whether citizens have the ability to restrain themselves automatically.

### Compensation for Casualties in the Jindu Incident Vigorous Suppression of Scalpers

Director Yu Shuping replied to inquiries: (1) In response to Chen Peide's suggestion that two police officers took away the rickshaw pullers' cushions, he has repeatedly ordered it to be prohibited. He plans to have patrol station police officers manage the issue and set up mobile police stations to manage illegal situations. (2) In response to Zhang Zhihan's question: The bandit leader in Pudong committed crimes in the Nanhui area, so he was escorted to that county. The so-called jailbreak situation has been reported to the Department for record. Armed personnel interfering with citizens without cause has been repeatedly addressed with the Department for suppression, but it has not been completely eliminated. The Ling Elementary School case has been handled by the court. In the Jindu tragedy, two citizens died and one was injured, and the municipal government has been asked to provide compensation. (3) Zhao Junhao reported two things: (1) The Xin Kang Flour Mill on Pingliang Road was occupied last October by representatives of the creditor group, along with Sun Zhongxuan, a judicial section member of the Jianlin Road Police Station, who beat the workers. Lawyer Ji Fang represented the mill in a newspaper appeal to the Council, causing social uproar. Why hasn't the authorities investigated and dealt with police officers abusing their power in this way, and why hasn't the police station made a statement after the mill's advertisement for three days? (2) Scalpers in this city are becoming increasingly rampant, and some are taking an international route, leading Americans to improper places in the wharf area. If they are not suppressed, what kind of "national diplomacy" can this be considered? Director Yu replied: The Xin Kang Flour Mill case on Pingliang Road has been sent to the court. If it is found that judicial section members violated the law, they will be severely dealt with. Scalpers are also being vigorously suppressed, but due to the difficulty of the situation, it is impossible to eradicate them all at once. (4) In response to Zhang Zhongyuan's question: Because second-hand goods dealers purchase stolen goods, fingerprinting is used to investigate past crimes, which is not without reason. New prostitute licenses have been suspended since January. (5) In response to Chen Cunren's question: Beggars occupying small vegetable markets will definitely be suppressed. (6) In response to Shi Wende's question: Suburban police vehicles are lacking due to lack of funds, and he hopes that the Council members can initiate donations. (7) Regarding Tao Baichuan's statement that a police officer on Haining Road falsely accused a 13-year-old elementary school student of stealing wire, causing him to be beaten, he said that he was not aware of this and would definitely investigate and deal with it strictly. (8) In response to Jiang Hao's question: Public gambling must be prohibited. Regarding the alleged disguised prostitution investigation by police officers at the Yangshi Cangzhou Hotel, but staying overnight until the next morning before calling the police to arrest the prostitutes, he doubts that this would happen and will investigate and clarify the matter further.

The Municipal Council will continue to hold its sixth meeting this afternoon to discuss proposals.

### Director Wu's Reply to Inquiries on the Prohibition of Dancing "I Have Done Nothing Wrong" "I am Doing Right By the Dancers"

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, replied to inquiries in the Assembly yesterday, making a detailed explanation of the dance ban issue, and stated that he "has thought it over and over, and has done nothing wrong. It can be said that I am doing right by the citizens and doing right by the dancers." Regarding Zhang Zhongyuan and Zhang Zhihan's question of whether the Central Government could be asked to temporarily postpone the dance ban, and why the Municipal Government did not respect the Council's resolution, he said: I can responsibly answer that if the Central Government approves temporary execution, then this Bureau will definitely comply. Or, if the Central Government does not make any statement before the end of March, then execution will also be temporarily postponed. As for the Council's resolution, I not only submitted official documents to the Central Government, but also went to the capital in person to state my case to the Central Government, even to the point of becoming hoarse, but the Central Government still refused to allow it, and execution was required. Therefore, it was the Central Government that did not accept the Council's resolution, and I felt regretful about this. As for myself, being a government official, it is inconvenient to speak to the Central Government on behalf of the councilors. He hopes that the councilors will elect representatives to speak, which may make one aware of the experience I have had.

Central Government Urges, Cannot Be Delayed Any Longer

Regarding Fan Xipin's criticism of why the lottery time was not according to regulations, the lottery method was unreasonable, why was it not prohibited before the dance industry meeting, why were representatives not seen for petitioning, why did the dance industry representatives say it was at New Xianlin, but then mentioned it at the Bureau of Social Affairs, and on the issue of establishing a special court, Director Wu replied: (1) The lottery time was changed to the morning because the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee meeting was scheduled for the afternoon of that day (i.e., January 31st), and on January 29th, a telegram was received from the Central Government inquiring about the lottery situation, so it was decided that it could not be postponed any longer and had to be held in the morning. (2) There is no need for a legal quorum for the lottery. The Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were asked to send representatives, but both replied that it was inconvenient to participate.

Smuggling Unnoticed, No Prevention

(3) Before the dance industry meeting, Director Yu specially sent a flying fortress to prohibit it. However, the dance industry personnel used a clandestine method, smuggling unnoticed. After indicating to the police that they would disband, they ran to the Social Affairs Bureau. Later, Commander Xuan rebuked the representatives at the Social Affairs Bureau. The meeting started at 3:00 PM, and the Garrison Command only received notification at 2:00 PM. (4) Whether the dance industry representatives actually petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau can be proved by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker who were present at the time. (5) I did not know that the dance industry representatives were meeting at New Xianlin. It was Mr. Fan Xipin himself who told me. (6) Whether a special court should be organized has nothing to do with Wu Kaixian. The chairman's order was given to Mayor Wu, not to me.

### Freezing the Cost of Living Index Testing Has Not Been Effective

In addition, (1) Regarding Zhang Zhihan's suggestion that the cost of living index has too much impact, whether a special review committee can be organized to study and suggest an appropriate solution to the Central Government. Director Wu said that there are currently two committees for the application and review of the cost of living index. If another committee is to be organized, he can also accept it. The method of freezing the cost of living index was tested last year, but it was not effective because prices still could not be frozen, and the reason why prices could not be frozen was because of inflation. My opinion is that I hope the Assembly will resolve to ask the Central Government to quickly open up industrial loans, or use the method of purchasing manufactured goods to allow factories to barely survive and prevent workers from becoming unemployed. Otherwise, within six months, a major incident will occur in Shanghai.

### Arrangement for Refugees to Engage in Production

(2) Regarding the noble inquiry about the price of rice for workers rising to 80,000 yuan per dou, Wu replied that it was an order from the Central Government, but the rice price in the January cost of living index was compiled according to 81,000 yuan. (3) Regarding the refugee problem inquired about by Mei Jiannong and Shi Guan, he said that he would do his best to ask the Ministry of Social Affairs for several general labor unions to allow refugees to engage in production.

### If the Number of Ballots Does Not Exceed the Number Issued, It Cannot Be Considered Fraudulent

Regarding the inquiries to the Bureau of Civil Affairs, Director Zhang Xiaosong answered each one as follows: (1) Regarding the problem of the conciliation committees in various districts proposed by Qu Yue, Director Zhang stated that the conciliation committees have no legal authority, so many disputes cannot be completely resolved. (2) Regarding the point inquired by Yao Baozhen and Li Shuzi as to why the self-defense force has not yet been established, it will be handled within a short period of time. (3) Jia Dechao questioned Mayor Wu regarding election fraud. He replied: The mayor did not attend due to official duties. Within my scope, I can answer that I am the executive director of the election office, and my responsibility is to perform my duties. The reason why the number of votes is higher than the number of votes when electing councilors is because the population at that time was 3.4 million, while now it is more than 4.4 million. Also, if the number of votes cast does not exceed the number of ballots issued, it is not considered fraud. Some polling stations in various districts are sparsely populated, while others are crowded. As for the district with more votes cast than ballots issued, it is true. Taking the Zhenru district as an example, there are 23,676 voters, 16,500 ballots were issued, and the district head reported that only 5,033 votes were cast, but the number of votes counted was 11,114. Although there were more votes cast, the number did not exceed the number of ballots issued, so it cannot be considered fraud. As for the election results in that district, the votes cast for [name] were the most, accounting for 7,367 votes, which is a fact. In short, the supervisory committee is thoroughly investigating whether there was any fraud in this election. After the investigation, there will be appropriate measures. (4) Regarding the inquiry by Zong [name] about the accounts of the military conscription consolation fund, it is said that the conscript comfort is handled by each district, and the expenses for subsidizing resettlement costs are reported by fourteen districts, and other districts are still being urged to report. As for fraud, there is indeed a case, and personnel from the Bao Tuan Department have been sent to the law [illegible] in five cases and two have fled (5) Shao Yongsheng's suggestion to respect the powers of the district people's representative assembly, strengthen the Bao Tian organization, and train district Bao personnel will be accepted and improved as appropriate. However, the Baomin meetings and training venues are not yet available, so they cannot be handled quickly. (6) Regarding Zhao Yangxiong's question of whether the district chief can also be a councilor, the Ministry of Interior explained that he cannot hold both positions, and he will be notified to the Assembly after further investigation.

### US Military Iron Barge Causes Accident Zhongfang Tugboat Sinks After Collision

[Our Newspaper] The Zhongfang Construction Company's Fangjian No. 1 tugboat was suddenly hit hard by the US Army's No. 792 iron barge as it left the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf, piercing its waist and sinking immediately. Fortunately, the employees on board were able to jump onto the dock and were unharmed. The Fangjian No. 1 tugboat has a displacement of 40 tons and is 70 feet long. It was formerly the China Merchants Bureau's Feicheng steam launch. The night before, it towed two Zhongfang iron barges to transport yarn to the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf, where it was transferred to the Haiyu to be transported to Hong Kong. After the loading was completed that night, the Haiyu set anchor to leave the port at around 5:00 AM yesterday. The Fangjian No. 1 tugboat was planning to leave the wharf when it was hit by the US ship due to attempting to avoid a civilian ship, causing the accident. It is reported that the US Army has scheduled today to ask the US Navy to send a crane to lift the sunken ship and is willing to be responsible for compensating all losses.

### Ye Qiuyuan, Chief Writer of This Newspaper, Passed Away in the Hospital This Morning The Corpse Was Sent to the International Funeral Home, and the Encoffining is Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] Ye Qiuyuan (Jian Gang), the chief writer of this newspaper, unfortunately passed away at the Gongji Hospital at 0:30 this morning due to a sudden heart condition, at the age of 42. Mr. Ye was usually in good health, but after being injured in a car accident last August, although he recovered, his physical strength gradually declined. In the process of treatment at Gongji Hospital, symptoms of heart disease were found, and the doctor ordered him to rest carefully. However, Mr. Ye was committed to service, so after being discharged from the hospital after recovery, he resumed his work as usual. Last winter, he felt unwell and thought that his old stomach illness had recurred. When he went to the hospital for an examination on February 5, he found that his heart disease had worsened. He was discharged from the hospital on the 25th, and returned to Gongji for another consultation on the 27th. Yesterday, Mr. Ye still planned to do his duty in spite of his illness. In the afternoon, he also attended the Catholic Church meeting, but at 5:00 PM, he suddenly suffered from severe stomach pain and asthma. He rushed to Gongji Hospital and found that his condition had worsened. He was given oxygen treatment at 10:00 PM, but it was too late. He passed away at 0:30 this morning. The body has been sent to the International Funeral Home, and the encoffining is scheduled for 1:00 PM on the 4th (Thursday).

Mr. Ye's Brief Biography

Mr. Ye was from Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He was born in February, five years before the founding of the Republic of China. At the age of seventeen, he traveled across the ocean to study politics at Indiana University in the United States. In 1927, he returned to China and served as an editor for Shen Bao and a professor at Fudan University, at the age of only twenty-one. In 1933, he was hired as the director of the Department of Political Economy at China Public School, when he was only twenty-seven years old. During the Anti-Japanese War, he took refuge in Hong Kong and served as the editor-in-chief of the English-language "Tien Hsia Monthly". When Hong Kong fell, he went to the capital and served as a member of the Legislative Yuan until today. After the publication of this newspaper after the victory, Mr. Ye came to Shanghai with Mr. Chen, the general manager of this newspaper. Half of the daily editorials came from his hand. Mr. Ye was not only a famous reporter and a famous professor, but also a devout religious person. He was a lifelong Catholic and spared no effort in promoting his beliefs in writing. In 1944, he went abroad to inspect the British, American, and Roman church affairs, and wrote the book "Pilgrim's Progress" after returning to China.

### Compensation Machinery Guest Invitation to Visit Mostly Japanese-Made Clothing Some German Products Careful Packaging and Good Quality

[Our Newspaper] The Japanese compensation for private enterprises that the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Counseling Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs received, so far, has a total of 343 boxes of machines, including more than ten kinds of lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, and shapers, all stored in the seventh pier warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong. In order to let people from all walks of life understand the contents of the received machines, the office has specially invited representatives from all walks of life to visit for three consecutive days, starting yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, factory personnel and news reporters, the first group to participate, took the China Merchants Bureau's Guoguang ship to the warehouse for a visit.

Heaps of Japanese Compensation Machinery [Photo by Our Newspaper]

Machine Age Five to Ten Years

A total of 20 boxes were opened yesterday. These machines are carefully packaged, of good quality, and free of rust. Most of them are made in Japan, and some are made in Germany. The age is five to ten years old, and there are also a few that are less than five years old or more than ten years old. The factory representatives who participated in the visit were all engrossed and discussed a lot, but they all thought they were usable.

Converting Legal Tender Calculating Evaluation

Director Gu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs told reporters yesterday about the handling of private enterprise compensation materials, saying that the evaluation committee has been established, but has not yet held a meeting. In the future, the first step will be to decide on several major evaluation principles. The price set by the Allied Headquarters is in US dollars. The evaluation after our country receives them in the future will have its own standards. Although the unit is US dollars, the payment will be calculated in legal tender according to the official exchange rate of the National Bank. Because the machines are not easy to keep after they are unpacked, they will not be unpacked when they are distributed to the factories in the future. If the factory finds that there is a problem with the machine after unpacking, the evaluation meeting will also formulate a unified processing method for this.

Electricity Repayment Price Becomes a Problem

According to the opinions of the factory representatives who visited yesterday, it is believed that this type of machine averages about two tons each, and the value of each machine is about 500 million yuan. The machines are certainly usable, but the problems are: First, electricity, that is, after the factory expands, is there enough electricity in the city to supply it? Second, the problem of repayment, that is, although it is currently stipulated to pay in four installments, will it be possible to pay it off when the term expires? If it cannot be repaid, will the machine be taken back by the government? Therefore, they believe that buying a one at a price also has a "considerable risk."

### Municipal Councilors Re-election Not Accurate

[Our Newspaper] The term of office of the councilors in this city is legally limited to two years and should expire in August of this year, but the central government has clearly ordered that the term of office of the current councilors be extended until the official establishment of the city council. Yesterday, there was a rumor about the re-election of the councilors in this city. According to the person in charge of the Civil Affairs Bureau who spoke to reporters, this is indeed inaccurate.

### China Relief Society: British Woman Alleges Underage Girl in Care is Pregnant and About to Give Birth

[Report from this Newspaper] A British woman, Lin, recently filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate, accusing the China Relief Society, located at No. 361 Ying Shi Road in the Catholic Church, stating that her niece, Li Liwenkena, who is now 15 years old, suddenly became pregnant while at the Society. She requested an investigation. The facts of the complaint are as follows: Li Liwenkena lost both her parents when she was only two years old and was placed in the care of the China Relief Society. Last autumn, the director of the Society, Tao Guman, suddenly sent Li to the mental asylum affiliated with Guangci Hospital in Minhang, claiming that Li was mentally unstable and needed treatment. However, after Ge Lin investigated, Li was found not to be mentally ill but actually pregnant. The Society, fearing the news would leak, used the guise of mental illness to send her to Minhang for a secret birth. Ge Lin found it suspicious that Li was underage and pregnant and requested the District Procuratorate to investigate thoroughly. The District Procuratorate previously sent forensic doctor Wei Ligong to Minhang for an examination, and Li was indeed found to be pregnant and about to give birth. Yesterday, Prosecutor Yu Yixin opened the court for investigation, and Ge Lin attended and requested an investigation into who had sexually assaulted Li. As no one from the accused China Relief Society appeared in court, the hearing was postponed.

### Rice Prices: Expired, Invalid; Each Dou of Rice Must Weigh 15 Jin (City Pounds); Strict Punishment for Confirmed Defalcation and Fraud

[Report from this Newspaper] According to Ji Mingzhai, Section Chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau: Rice distribution for March is divided into two phases, the first phase from the 1st to the 12th, and the second phase from the 16th to the 28th. Distribution certificates from the first phase are not valid for the second phase, and all expired certificates will be invalid. The rice distributed this month is rice belonging to our government. Each person receives one dou. Next month, the distribution of American relief rice will begin. The total distribution volume for this month is 500,000 dan. The rice shops that are authorized to distribute rice are determined by the People's Food Allocation Committee based on their actual sales reported in December of last year. Those whose monthly sales are less than 60 shi do not have the right to distribute rice. If a rice shop authorized to distribute rice this month sells less than 60 shi, its authorization will also be revoked next month. If the sales situation is good and all rice is sold out, they can apply to increase the distribution quota. The rice certificate states that each dou of rice must weigh 15 jin (city pounds). Strict punishment will be given if defalcation or fraud is discovered.

After the full rice allocation system was implemented in this city, it was originally stipulated that in addition to the one dou allocated to each person, another certificate would be issued to restrict purchases of one dou at free market prices, and no more could be purchased. Now, due to the floating population in this city and the fact that some citizens have large appetites, this restriction has been relaxed. Those without certificates can also purchase rice in the free market, but they cannot buy too much. If it is felt that the method of restricting purchases of one dou with a certificate is no longer needed next month, it will be cancelled, and only one dou will be allocated by the government, with the rest left to citizens to obtain from the free market.

### Drawing Method

When the lottery was drawn, thousands of citizens went to the stadium to watch. The stadium gate was decorated with colorful county flags. A temporary drawing platform was set up in the sports field, illuminated by bright mercury lights. The drawing equipment was borrowed from the Central Savings Society and consisted of three globe-shaped steel drawing balls that could rotate up and down. The ball in the center of the stage, called the A ball, was about two feet in diameter. The balls on the left and right, called the B and C balls, were about one foot in diameter. The number balls were about the size of bullets. The 600,000 lottery tickets for the Group B houses were divided into 50 groups, with each group (i.e., each character) having 12,000 tickets, numbered from 00000 to 11999, for a total of 12,000 numbers. The drawing method involved shaking each of the three balls separately and then combining the results. The first ball shaken was the C ball, which contained 50 small balls engraved with characters such as "Ju" (巨), "Que" (闕), "Zhu" (珠), "Cheng" (稱), etc., representing the group of the lottery ticket. The second ball was the B ball, which contained 12 small balls engraved with numbers 00 to 11, representing the first two digits of the lottery ticket number. The third ball was the A ball, which contained 1,000 small balls engraved with numbers 000 to 999, representing the last three digits of the lottery ticket number. The combined result of each shake of the three balls was the winning number for a certain group. The character drawn from the C ball was not returned to the ball for the second draw, while the numbers drawn from the A and B balls were returned to the balls for the second draw. This process was repeated 50 times to obtain the 50 winning numbers.

Various Representatives Arrive One After Another

The drawing ceremony began at 2:25 PM. Around 2:00 PM, the stands were already crowded with people. The staff of the Winter Relief Committee, led by Director-General Wang Xianqing, were busy with the arrangements. Supervisor Yan Zhuang, Jiangsu Inspector; Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Yuan Wenzhang, Division Chief; Xu Jilong of the City Chamber of Commerce; Chen Hanbing of the Local Court; Quan Dian of the District Procuratorate; Feng Youzhen of the Journalists Association; Wang Zhengyi of the Federation of Trade Unions; Chen Yide, representative of the City Party Headquarters, and other representatives from various sectors arrived one after another. Mayor Wu arrived at 2:15 PM, and the ceremony began shortly thereafter. First, the mayor gave a speech stating that the cost of the Group B houses was estimated at 800 million based on March prices, while the market value was over 1.6 billion. Recently, some people have suspected that the lottery method for the charity tickets is not transparent. Today's drawing here should dispel such unfounded rumors.

Nearly 100,000 Tickets Not Sold

Wang Xianqing then reported that out of the 600,000 Group B tickets, 504,169 had been sold, and the remaining unsold tickets were being kept by the City Bank. Less than half of the Group A tickets have been sold so far, so the drawing has been postponed to April 16. After explaining the lottery method, Wang began the drawing at 2:45 PM. First, the character balls and number balls were placed into the three large A, B, and C balls. Supervisor Yan Zhuang checked to make sure everything was correct. When placing the number balls from 000 to 199, some accidentally fell to the ground. All the balls were carefully checked to show due diligence. Each shake involved three rotations, and then the gate was opened, and one small ball from each of the three large balls rolled out and into a pre-placed glass cylinder. The staff announced the numbers in front of the microphone, hung them on a blackboard, and filled them in on a red sign on the wall. At the same time, the Victory Radio Station broadcast the progress of the drawing for citizens to listen to. The first group drawn was the "Shi" (始) group, and the last group drawn was the "Ju" (巨) group. The entire drawing was completed at 3:30 PM.

### Redeem Certificates with Tickets Starting on the 5th

As for the names of the winners of the winning numbers, it was still impossible to determine them yesterday. Anyone who finds themselves to be a lucky winner can bring their tickets to the Winter Relief Committee's Housing Charity Group at the City Chamber of Commerce starting on March 5 to exchange them for a certificate. They can move in after the houses are built.

Before the drawing, Mayor Wu reported that he had received letters from Zhu Chenglie and Zhu Chengyong, students of the affiliated elementary school of Nanyang Middle School, each of whom used 1 million yuan of their New Year's money to buy 10 Group B charity tickets. If they won, they were willing to donate the proceeds from the sale of the house to scholarship funds. Another anonymous person also wrote that they had purchased 10 Group B tickets and, if they won, would also donate them to winter relief. Unfortunately, none of the 30 tickets won.

### Annual Production of Five Million Trees: Largest Export Commodity; Timber: Planting, Felling, Transport, and Sales

[Report from Fuzhou on February 27 via airmail] In Fujian Province, regardless of the season, the largest export commodity is timber. The term "Jian Timber" is very familiar in South China, North China, and even Southeast Asia and the Philippines. It is produced in many corners of Fujian Province, with Jian'ou and Jianyang in the Min River basin being the most famous production areas. Other counties such as Shaxian, Shuiji, Songxi, Zhenghe, Shunchang, Chong'an, Gutian, Youxi, Nanping, Yong'an, Changting, Longyan, Datian, and Yongding are also areas where forests are concentrated. According to pre-war statistics, the annual production in the Min River area alone was about 3.9 million trees, the Ting River area had 900,000 trees, the Jiulong River had 170,000 trees, and other areas had about 200,000 trees, for a total of 5 million trees. Multiplying this number by today's currency value yields an enviable amount.

There are many types of "Jian Timber," mainly including fir, pine, camphor, paulownia, Phoebe zhennan, rosewood, Chinese tallow tree, Phoebe, Cunninghamia lanceolata, poplar, and boxwood, among dozens of others. However, in terms of exports, fir and pine are the most common. Today, the timber flowing down the Min River, transported through Mawei, and loaded onto ships in batches to the south and north is almost entirely these two types. This type of timber all comes from deep mountains and wilderness. Tracing its ancestry, transmission, and sales process offers a unique flavor.

Planting: Diligent Cultivation, Renewal

Given the massive annual logging and continuous exports, Fujian timber is by no means naturally grown and thriving. It requires very planned and patient diligent cultivation, and this must be done every year through "renewal" work. In the counties of northern Fujian, the one million or more timber farmers generally plan the next year's planting in the autumn. First, they use the high winds and dry weather of autumn and winter to burn the mountains, then use the remaining ash and charcoal as fertilizer. When spring comes and it is time to plant and sprout, they transplant a large number of seedlings. In the first ten years, they must weed under each tree at least once a year. After ten years, when the trees have grown large and provide shade, they burn the mountains again, using the remaining ashes as fertilizer for the second batch of seedlings. Generally, a piece of timber needs to grow for 20 years, which means each tree needs to have 20 "growth rings" in its cross-section before it can become timber. (Generally, "正材" (standard timber) refers to timber that is more than six inches in diameter.) At this point, it can be felled at will, the roots removed completely, and then new seedlings are replaced in the same way. Generally, the mountain tops have strong winds and little water, making it difficult for trees to grow large, so seedlings are mostly planted on the sides of the mountains, where they can thrive more easily.

Felling: Determining the Direction Before the Axe

Felling timber is a rather difficult and arduous task. In the deep mountains and dense forests, it takes a lot of effort to use only axes and manpower to topple trees that have been rooted for decades and weigh tens of thousands of pounds. Fortunately, the Chinese have inherited a wealth of experience from ancient times, and the loggers also know how to use scientific principles. At the beginning of the axe swing, they first determine the "direction" of the tree, then open up the side in that direction. After cutting seven or eight tenths of the way through the wood, they use ropes to pull it down. After that, they cut off the branches and leaves, remove the bark, and then cut it into various types of timber according to its length and size. The ones that are the full length are called "long tips." Those that are one zhang six to one zhang four are called "standard timber." Those that are one zhang two are called "barrel timber." Those that are one zhang are called "横丹" (horizontal dan). Those that are eight chi are called "一比" (one bi). Anything less than eight chi is discarded as miscellaneous timber.

The loggers have a specialized nature and are all hired from other places. Currently, the daily wage can be 70,000 to 80,000, but it is extremely dangerous, and there is often the possibility of being crushed to death by trees. The logging foremen once implemented an extremely strict "unilateral rule" stipulating that the foreman only had to pay 5,000 yuan for each worker who was crushed to death. This "rule" has not been abolished to this day. A human life is worth less than a youtiao (fried dough stick), which is extremely lamentable.

Transport: Relying Entirely on Mountain Streams; Five Procedures

Because timber is felled entirely in the mountains, transport relies almost entirely on mountain streams. Therefore, the first step is to move the timber to the side of the stream. Regarding this, there are five procedures: (1) "Opening the road"; (2) "Arranging bamboo," that is, placing bamboo rafts for walking and working; (3) Releasing into the stream: transporting the timber to the side of the stream; (4) Stamping: stamping the timber with the iron seal of the "business" or "gang" for identification; (5) Building rafts: This structure is extremely complex and is something that researchers of timber transport and sales cannot ignore. The so-called "raft building" method is divided into three layers. The smallest unit is the tree, followed by the "du" (笃), and then the "yun" (运). Each du is based on the size of the timber, with some having five trees (called five-bottomed) and some having seven trees (called seven-bottomed), divided into 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 27, and 30 types. Anything beyond 30 bottoms is called "捆根" (bundled roots). Then, the "du" is merged into "lian" (连). Usually, the "yun" is also divided into 6 du, 7 du, 8 du, 12 du, 14 du, and other types. Then, bamboo nails and ropes are added. Once the spring floods come, it can be transported down the river. (Usually, it takes four to five months to a year from felling to transport.) Moreover, according to the old system, the workers transporting the timber had to change shifts three times. The first shift pushed from various upstream areas to Nanping, the second shift pushed from Nanping to Shuikou, and the third shift released it from Shuikou to Fuzhou. Each did not infringe on the other's territory, otherwise, a lawsuit would immediately be filed. According to statistics, during the peak period, the number of timber transported down the Min River each month reached 2,500 to 3,000 yun.

Sales: Domestic and Foreign, Far and Wide

The sales situation of "Jian Timber" can be divided into two categories: domestic and foreign. One is to purchase and transport it from the production area to Fuzhou, and the other is to transship it from Fuzhou to other ports (mainly Qingdao, Tianjin, Yingkou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Shanghai). Currently, there are two main factions operating in this business in Fuzhou. One is the "company faction," including Overseas Chinese, China Forest Company, Xingye Company, Jimei Company, Huatong Company, Fujian Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Company, and a large number of merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The other is the "muke" (木客) gang. This faction is weak but large in numbers. They are mostly responsible for transporting and selling goods from the production area to Fuzhou. Because they have little capital, they are severely exploited. There are many disguised timber businesses in Fuzhou that specialize in offering high-interest loans. The target is this group of muke. In addition to having to sell the timber to the business at the time, borrowers still have to calculate interest and pay commissions. Furthermore, the remaining funds must be repaid within ten days. Under this system, the situation of the timber farmers is extremely tragic. There is a story (which actually happened recently): A family in a certain county in northern Fujian has been a timber farmer for three generations. The grandfather planted the trees, the father felled the trees, and the son transported the trees to Fuzhou for sale. As a result, after deducting transportation costs and debt repayment, they only had enough money to buy a cotton blanket to bring back for the winter. The miserable life of the timber farmers in Fujian is evident. Due to frequent price increases in the production areas and high transportation costs, general companies are also reluctant to move forward. In addition, the situation in North China has recently become tense, and the sales routes to the north have almost been cut off, creating widespread panic in the forestry industry. According to Chen Peizhi, Deputy Manager of Overseas Chinese China Forestry Company, major companies had already reported losses half a year ago. Currently, the profit margin for timber transported from Fuzhou to Shanghai, excluding shipping costs, is less than one-tenth. The only solution is to stockpile it in warehouses and wait for prices to rise. Currently, the number of local materials stockpiled in Fuzhou, Nanping, and Shanghai has gradually become considerable. It is still difficult to predict when it can be sold off...

General opinion is that the future of "Jian Timber" is worrisome. Because timber farmers cannot make a profit, the planting of new trees has disappeared in the past two years. If this continues year after year, the source of "Jian Timber" will be completely cut off in ten or twenty years. However, the government cannot currently prohibit free felling, otherwise, the lives of millions of timber farmers will be completely devastated. How to support timber farmers, open up sales channels, plant more trees, and improve transport and sales methods should be the main tasks of the agricultural and forestry authorities in Fujian Province.

### Fujian to Establish a Provincial Forest Bureau: Suggests Increasing Allocations for Afforestation Loans

[Report from this Newspaper in Fuzhou on the 1st] In order to strengthen forest management and administration, Fujian Province has recently decided to establish a provincial forest bureau within this year, dividing it into four districts: Min River, Longting, Jinzhang, and Min East. Each district will have a forest management agency. Agricultural extension offices will be established in all counties, and forest protection associations will be established in all townships to strictly prohibit wasteful felling. The expenses for this will be collected from "forest owners" and "muke" (timber merchants), called "afforestation funds." The remainder will be a suggestion to the central government to add an "afforestation loan" item under agricultural loans to enable widespread afforestation.

### Fujian Reforms Tenancy System: Expands Rent Restriction Propaganda

[Report from this Newspaper in Fuzhou on February 28 via airmail] In order to actively reform the provincial tenancy system, Fujian Province, in addition to handling the work of supporting self-cultivating farmers in Longyan County before the new year and continuing to handle the work of supporting cultivation in Ningde, Shanghang, and other counties, has recently ordered county governments to supervise township offices to investigate the area of cultivated land in their jurisdiction, the names of the main products, and the quantity of harvest units, and to expand propaganda about the 37.5% rent restriction, guide farmers in revising lease contracts, and mediate disputes between landlords and tenants, thereby benefiting farmers.

### Canal Route: Transportation Resumes

[Report from this Newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 1st] Transportation on the canal route has now resumed. The Minglin steamboat, the first vessel of the Fuyun Company, loaded with passengers and cargo from Huaiyin, safely arrived in Zhenjiang at 11:00 AM today. According to the officer of the vessel, during the recent disturbance by bandits, wooden stakes were placed in the canal to obstruct navigation, but they have now been removed by the National Army and waterway security personnel, and transportation is unobstructed. It is reported that during the Battle of Fanshui, the vessel transported ammunition with the army and resupplied the National Army at Pingqiao. Near Sanbu, it was ambushed by bandits, but the escorting National Army repelled them. All the crew members were unharmed, but the vessel and tugboat were riddled with bullet holes.

### Lanzhou University Prevents Escalation of Situation: Intensifies Control Measures Yesterday

[Report from this Newspaper in Lanzhou on February 29] Regarding the Lanzhou University incident, the reporter interviewed Lanzhou University's Dean of Student Affairs Duan Zimei, Dean of the Law School Xiang Yuxu, and Dean of Academic Affairs Xun Shuangqiu. They stated that the rights and wrongs of the Lanzhou University incident should naturally be adjudicated by the Garrison Headquarters. They tried their best to dissuade the students from marching beforehand to no avail, but they sent two deans of student affairs to accompany the group. Fortunately, the marching order was good. Yesterday, upon hearing rumors from the outside world, they deeply feared that lawless elements would mix into the school and cause incidents, escalating the situation. Therefore, they strengthened the gate security. When asked whether they had heard about the discovery of reactionary slogans yesterday, Duan replied: It is said that a man named Wei Yanling posted them and has been arrested by the security authorities. Since there are clues, the truth can be revealed. However, I guarantee that it was not done by university students and promise that, starting today, the actions of the students can be controlled. It was also reported that the Lanzhou University student-organized "February 25 Tragedy Support Association" announced on the 29th that it would use the former name internally and the name of all Lanzhou University students externally. The reporter met its representative, Xue Xiqing. He stated that regarding the motivation, general student views, and hopes of supporting injured classmates, he said firmly that the students of Lanzhou University absolutely trust the fair handling of the Garrison Headquarters but firmly demand the realization of four conditions. Recently, it has been heard that unscrupulous elements from the outside world have taken the opportunity to incite them. I can represent all the students to express that the purpose is absolutely pure, and the actions are absolutely simple. All external documents of the school's students have a stamp as proof. The records of each gathering in the school are absolutely public. The school has already requested the security authorities to prevent any intentional slander from the outside world, and the school's students will also examine themselves. The only way is to prove the school's position with facts in the future.

### Changsha Rice Distribution: Pregnant Woman Tragically Trampled to Death

### Yuan Dynasty Relic: Bronze Clepsydra (Water Clock) Resumes Timekeeping

[Report from this Newspaper in Guangzhou on February 28 via airmail] The Guangzhou Municipal Museum houses a precious bronze clepsydra (water clock), cast in the third year of the Yuan Dynasty's Yanyou era, belonging to Marshal Ma Suhu at the time. It was looted by the enemy during the occupation but recovered after the restoration. However, many parts were lost. It has recently been repaired and restored and has now resumed timekeeping and is open to the public. The device has a precise structure, with a total of four large and small bronze pots and a floating arrow. It uses dripping water to indicate the time. In the Ming Dynasty, the Westerner Matteo Ricci praised it highly and tried his best to imitate it, but he could not even get started, so its preciousness is evident.

### Impersonating Military Personnel: Extorting in Fujian, Arrested

[Report from this Newspaper in Fuzhou on February 28 via airmail] More than ten people, including Wang Dezhang and Zhai Guohong, who impersonated military personnel, previously used the name "Xuzhou Army Headquarters Comfort Group," carrying receipts and telegrams to various county and city government party headquarters and business trip permits, etc., to raise funds in Fujian. One of them, Wang Dezhang, was captured in Jian'ou. After interrogation by the Third District Commissioner's Office, he confessed to the fraud and revealed the situation of accomplices distributed in various places. The province has telegraphed various counties to prevent and arrest them.

### Lieutenant General Advisor Turns Pickpocket

[Our Chengdu Office, February 25th] The Chengdu Police Department yesterday arrested an elderly pickpocket. He trespassed into a residence in Caojia Lane, outside the North Gate, early in the morning, and stole clothing drying in the yard. He alarmed the owner, who shouted for his arrest, and he was taken into police custody. During interrogation, he tearfully wrote a statement, claiming his name was Shi Ce, age sixty-eight. In his youth, he graduated from the Army Rapid Training Academy, and joined the military soon after marriage, accumulating meritorious service. He participated in the Northern Expedition, bandit suppression, and the War of Resistance. In the eighteenth year of the Republic, he represented Liu Xiang as the Director of the Guangdong Office. During the war, he served as a Lieutenant General Advisor to the Sichuan-Kangsu (Sichuan-Xikang) Pacification Commissioner's Office. After the victory, he was assigned to the 28th Army Officer Corps. He was discharged two years ago and has been unemployed ever since. With the high cost of living, his family property was completely exhausted, leading to separation from his wife and children. Coupled with old age and illness, and no means of support, he also developed an addiction. Unwilling to starve to death, he was forced to resort to pickpocketing. His handwriting and writing style were both elegant and readable. When he recounted his glorious experiences during the Sichuan Army's internal wars, he couldn't help but shed tears of old age. The presiding military judge was moved by his plight and released him. He began to wander off into the twilight, humming the line, "Where to go, at the edge of the sky so vast?"

### Traitorous Bandits Disturb Fengxian Coastal Areas

### New and Old County Magistrates Hand Over Duties; Disaster Relief Rice Turns into Sugar Lumps

[Our Fuzhou Office, February 28th] A "switch" of disaster relief rice occurred before and after the handover of duties between the new and old county magistrates of Ningde County, Fujian. It is said that the former county magistrate, Huang Guangyu, received more than 290 tons of disaster relief rice allocated by the Executive Yuan for the Xipitang reclamation project in the county. Two hundred tons were transported and distributed during his tenure, and the rice quality was still good. The remaining ninety tons were stored in Fuzhou. In January of this year, Huang was transferred, and Liu Dexin took over the vacancy. After taking office, Liu began transporting the rice. However, when the rice, about 1,800 piculs, worth over a billion (currency unspecified) was transported to the county seat a few days ago, it had all turned into broken rice and bran lumps. Moreover, it was moldy and unfit for consumption, causing a great uproar throughout the county. An investigation is currently underway at the Fuzhou headquarters.

### Examining Zhejiang's Highway Construction from the Perspective of Traffic Control for Bandit Suppression

[Our Hangzhou Office, 1st] Zhejiang's transportation was originally very convenient. Waterways could be used for travel, and land routes had the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways connecting the northeast and west. The development and quality of highways were particularly prominent in the country; only in the mountainous areas of southern Zhejiang was transportation more difficult. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Zhejiang's transportation was severely damaged, and the railways and highways were almost completely destroyed. After more than two years of recovery, due to financial difficulties, only the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line and slightly less than two-thirds of the highways have been repaired. The reporter has reported extensively on the progress of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and under the grand objective of "traffic control for bandit suppression," highway transportation in Zhejiang Province is becoming increasingly important. Recovery and construction have also made considerable progress, so I am also reporting this to readers who are concerned about national construction. The era of Zhejiang's highways began between the 5th and 16th years of the Republic of China. The provincial government used the tobacco tax revenue to build the Xiaoshao, Shengxin, and Huangze sections, totaling eighty-seven kilometers. At the same time, it encouraged merchants to invest in the construction of the Hangyu, Yulin, Yuwu, Hangfu, and Pinghu Sang road lines, totaling one hundred eighty-eight kilometers. At that time, the average construction cost per kilometer was only six thousand yuan. After the 16th year of the Republic of China, due to political stability, a comprehensive plan was undertaken, and a provincial road network was planned. The province and merchants simultaneously actively carried out the plan. Among them, the larger projects were the Zhejiang-Fujian, Zhejiang-Anhui, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines. By the 23rd year, two thousand nine hundred and six kilometers had been built. The Luopu, Qin, Longpu, Jiangpu, Fengxin, and Xintianlin lines, which were previously considered difficult to construct, were also completed one after another. In the 24th and 25th years, the Hangjue, Jiahai, and Lisong lines, totaling four hundred and seventy kilometers, were completed. In the first half of the 26th year, the Kaijiang Road, Jiaxing District Transportation Road, and Yongruiping Road, totaling more than three hundred kilometers, were completed, reaching a total of three thousand seven hundred and seventeen kilometers before the transportation (referring to full completion). By this time, the provincial highway network had been largely completed. At that time, in terms of area, there was one kilometer of highway for every twenty square kilometers; in terms of county territory, except for the counties of Qingyuan, Jining, Xianju, Yuhuan, and Dinghai, which were mostly mountains or isolated islands in the sea, all other counties could communicate with each other. However, the flames of the Japanese invaders destroyed so much of the crystallization of so much blood and sweat! Zhejiang borders Shanghai, and Hangzhou and Jiaxing fell first. The coastal highways of Ningbo were deliberately destroyed for strategic reasons; and in May of the 31st year, when the enemy invaded Quzhou and Lishui, the highways suffered the deepest damage. At that time, only the Longpu Road, totaling ninety-three kilometers, remained. Later, as the situation improved, repairs were gradually made. Until the eve of victory, there were still the Longquan-Qingyuan, Jiangshan-Pucheng, Jiangshan-Changshan, Tangshan-Chunan, Caoping-Changshan, Huabu-Zhejiang, Fengling, Yiduguan-Youtou-Badu eight lines, totaling 768.10 kilometers. After the victory, the Traffic Management Office conducted an emergency repair. In the 36th year, the office was changed to the Highway Bureau, and continued to advance (repair) . By August of the 36th year, the repaired routes included the Ligang Road (Lishui Chanshan to Dagangtou), Jiangyou Road (Jiangshan through Qujiang, Longyou, Lanxi to Jinhua), Shengyong Road (Shengxian through Dongyang to Yongkang), Biyou Road (Nanshan through Bihu to Longyou), Liyong Road (Lishui through Jinyun to Yongkang), Hangxian Road (Hangzhou through Shaoxing, Cao'e to Shengxian), Hangwen Road (Hangzhou through Yuhang, Lin'an, Yuqian, Changhua to Wenlingguan), Jinghang Road (Hangzhou through Wukang, Wuxing, Changxing to Wenshi), Yin Feng Road (Yinxian to Fenghua Xikou), Lanbai Road (Lanxi through Shouchang to Baisha), Liutang (leaving the (Qiantang) Qianjiang Bridge) Line, Hangtang Road (Sima to Tangqi section), Gongsan section (Gongchen Bridge to Sanlang Temple), Huhang Road (Hangzhou through Haining, Haiyan to Jinsiniang Bridge), Moqian Mountain Branch Line, Puzhong Road (Zhengjiawu to Pujiang), Yidong Road (Yiwu to Dongyang), Hangchun Road (Hangzhou through Tonglu, Jiande to Chun'an), Shangguan Line Shengxin section (Shengxian through Xinchang, Tiantai, Linhai, Huangyan to Zeguo), Zhapingjia Road (Zhapu through Pinghu to Jiaxing), Jiahai Road (Jiaxing through Wangjiangjing, Pingwang to Wuxing), Caoguan Road (Cao'e to Guanhaiwei), Guan Yin Road (Guanhaiwei to Ningbo), Fengxin Road (Xikou to Xinchang), Fenghai Road (Fenghua to Ninghai), Xuanwu Road (Xuanping to Wuyi), Yuwu Road (Yuhang to Penggong Huanghu), Zhenluo Road (Zhenhai to Luotuo Bridge), Siluo Road (Sixi to Luotuo Bridge), Luzhou Branch Line, Changgong Road (Changxing through Si'an to Guangquan), Fangyan Branch Line, Changyuan Branch Line, Tianlin Huangze Road (Tiantai through Linhai, Huangyan to Zeguo), Xintian Road (Xinchang to Tiantai), and other 36 lines, for a total of 2,252 kilometers repaired. Among them, there were 586 kilometers that were already open to traffic, but due to insufficient public funds and simple engineering, they still needed to be improved. By the end of the 36th year, another 338 kilometers had been repaired. There are 1,008 kilometers of routes that are being planned and implemented, or have already started construction locally, and are expected to be open to traffic this year. In Zhejiang Province, under the grand objective of traffic control for bandit suppression, this year it has been decided to complete twelve major trunk lines to meet military needs: the Chang (xing) Guang (de) line, the Hua (bu) Zheng (yuan) line, the Long (quan) Qing (yuan) line, the An (ji) Si (shui) line, the Yu (hang) Bai (guan) line, the Lan (xi) Pu (jiang) line, the Lin (hai) Xian (ju) line, the Yu (qian) Qian (qiuguan) line, the Yun (he) Jing (ning) line, the Tong (lu) Fen (shui) line, the Yu (hang) Wu (kang) line, and the Sanmen line, totaling 546 kilometers of highways. In order to facilitate the suppression of bandits in the Siming Mountain Pacification Zone, highways will be built from the county seats of Yuyao, Shangyu, Shengxian, Cixi, Fenghua, Xinchang, and Zhuji to Qingtinggang in Siming Mountain, using Qingtinggang as the center. In order to facilitate the suppression of bandits on the border between Zhejiang and Fujian, the governments of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces will cooperate to build the Qingyuan (Zhejiang) to Zhenghe (Fujian) highway. The Highway Bureau plans to build and has surveyed new roads, including the Yu'an and Zhensi roads, which are important routes to Anhui, the Sanmen Xia Line, the Shaolan Road, the Yu Bai Road, and the Shanhuan Xia Line, five routes.

Zhejiang's highway construction is far less in terms of quantity than two-thirds of what was formerly (the total highway quantity before the war), and in terms of quality, it is not as flat and strong as the original. However, opening the map, most of the provincial roads have been connected to various counties, such as Yuyao and other counties, and almost all towns in the county are connected (by road). As for neighboring provinces, there are already the Jinghang and Huhang National Highways connecting to Jiangsu, the Hangchuan National Highway and the Chun'an Huabu provincial road connecting to Anhui, and the Huabu Shanyuan, Changshan Yushan, Jiangshan Guangfeng, and Zheling Guangfeng four lines connecting to Jiangxi. Connecting to Fujian, there are the Zhemin National Highway, and the Long (quan) Pu (cheng) provincial road. Adding the planned routes, it can be truly said to be connected in all directions. However, the simplicity of the road surface and the lack of vehicles need to be greatly improved. This year is Zhejiang's year of construction. We hope that these three words "Year of Construction" are not just a slogan, not just to boost the morale of the staff, but to truly put the focus of provincial administration on construction and restore the vitality lost by the people of Zhejiang due to the war. The reporter deeply hopes that the future highway construction in Zhejiang will not only expand into new areas in terms of quantity, but also take into account the standards in terms of quality, and quickly complete permanent construction.

### Xi'an Lantern Market

[Our Xi'an Office, February 27th] If the winter in Chang'an is like an ink painting, with black representing people, dry trees, and crows, and white representing ice, boxes, and snow, and gray representing the sky, then after the Lunar New Year until the Lantern Festival, new colors are painted everywhere, and its splendor resembles a three-color halftone illustration or a five-color motion picture. Looking at the lantern market everywhere, with ten thousands of reds and greens, carved silver foil gold, we are reminded of the Chang'an lanterns described in old novels such as "Dream of the Red Chamber," whose beauty and liveliness are not exaggerated. At night, with the moon full and round, one sees a red lantern sending away the demons of winter and welcoming the god of spring, like a fishing line hooking up the beautiful childhood memories of many people. Moreover, just like paper-cut flowers, New Year pictures, and woodcut door gods, the Lantern Festival lanterns can also be studied from the perspectives of peasant folk art and folk customs. It reflects a side view of the Northwest countryside.

Although Chang'an is the imperial capital of past dynasties, the lanterns, whether in form, subject matter, or patterns, do not retain much of the imperial atmosphere. This proves on the contrary that lanterns originate from peasant soil.

In the author's memories of returning to his hometown from the coast of the South China Sea, our hometown has the most types and sizes of fish lanterns, as well as lanterns with themes of shellfish, shrimp, and crabs...These are some seafood-themed lanterns. Chang'an is located on the Northwest Plateau, far from the coast, so it's no wonder that in the lantern market, after searching for a long time, there is only one kind of goldfish lantern. It is probably modeled after the fish raised in a glass tank.

Conversely, there are many kinds of lanterns of animals and livestock here, which we don't have in our hometown. The Chang'an lantern market has many horse lanterns (not revolving lanterns), and occasionally some camels, donkeys, monkeys, and unknown wild birds and livestock. The people of Chang'an do not completely avoid white in the New Year, and white horse lanterns and white rabbit lanterns sell well. White horse lanterns are considered inauspicious by Cantonese people. It is difficult to see fresh lotus flowers in summer here, but the lotus flower lanterns are made more exquisitely than those made in the Jiangnan coastal areas. Each petal of the lotus flower is carefully traced with gold water to outline the veins of the petals, and the tips of the petals are wrapped in golden tips. This style clearly follows the lotus flowers painted in Buddhist statues. Reflecting the invasion of Western civilization, such as cars, trains, ships, and airplanes, there are fewer such lanterns than in the coastal areas of Jiangnan. I have not seen half a ship lantern to this day. Last year, an elementary school teacher made some airplane lanterns based on the designs in the newspaper, such as the "Spitfire," "Lightning," and "Black Widow" models, but the result was such a failure that he didn't dare to "try again" this year. This year, a type of airplane lantern with a "fantasy style" is popular, and the form is very interesting: the wings are transformed into two large triangular flags, and the edges of the flags are decorated with serrated tassels. The propeller has been changed to a windmill, and the elevators and rudder behind the plane have been changed to the tail feathers of birds. I firmly believe that this is a creative and reflective shape, and the beauty of a high-speed, airborne machine is "viewed as such" in the eyes of simple farmers. This is like a daydream, and it is also like Dali's "Surrealism."

Some of the lanterns here directly use bird feathers and animal fur pasted on the lantern paper. The author doesn't know if there are similar "realistic" methods elsewhere, so I record this together for those who are concerned with peasant folk art.

### Using Stilts to Promote the Prohibition Policy

[Our Xi'an Office, February 26th] The enforcement of the prohibition policy has always been a difficult and unrewarding task in Shaanxi, but since Yan'an was liberated and the situation in northern Shaanxi became clear last spring, the provincial government has sealed off 3,103 acres of opium poppy fields in one year. This most thorough method has already proven its effectiveness with numbers. According to the latest statistics, more than 5,800 taels of drugs were seized and 3,000 drug cases were handled in the province last year, which is clearly a reduction of one-half to two-thirds compared to the more than 18,000 taels seized and the more than 6,000 drug cases handled in the previous year.

Of course, we are still far from completely eradicating (opium), for example, the repeated extensions of the deadline for warning smokers in this city to quit show that this is difficult to achieve "in one fell swoop." These days, during the Lantern Festival, "Shehu (local opera performances)" and "high stilts" are mobilized everywhere, and using the method of "new wine in old bottles", using "high stilts" to promote the prohibition policy has given the citizens a deep impression.

"Wangxiangmen" is the execution ground in Xi'an for opium offenders, so some "high stilts" are also writing eye-catching slogans: "Outside Yuxiangmen, turn back as soon as possible." (Our reporter, Mai Ye)

### The Zhongzheng Cultural District Must Be Relocated

[Our Office] The former sites of the Longhua and Hualong Bridge airfields in the city were purchased by the city government by issuing public bonds before the war, and are now public land owned by the city. The Municipal Education Bureau had planned to move and concentrate the city's middle schools there to establish the Zhongzheng Cultural District, but the sites of the two airfields are currently being used by the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, and after several negotiations, no results have been achieved. The municipal meeting has now decided to sell the public land to the Civil Aviation Administration, so the Education Bureau must purchase land elsewhere to build the Zhongzheng Cultural District.

### The Education Bureau is Encouraging Industrial and Commercial Circles to Establish Vocational Supplementary Schools

Teaching Subjects Will Be Submitted to the Bureau Affairs Meeting for Discussion

[Our Office] In order to facilitate the promotion of the establishment of vocational supplementary schools by various factories, companies, stores, and groups, the Municipal Education Bureau has formulated the subjects required to be established in vocational supplementary schools and their weekly teaching hours. After more than two months of investigation and research, it has achieved concrete results and will be submitted to the next Bureau Affairs Meeting for discussion. The Education Bureau is now encouraging various industry trade associations to establish these supplementary schools. The Education Bureau will not appoint the principals and teachers, but will be hired by the industry trade associations themselves. Since each industry has its own professional technical subjects, the qualifications of teachers in vocational supplementary schools are not limited to those who have been examined and registered.

### City Normal School Students Petition for Increased Food Expenses

[Our Newspaper] Students of the Municipal Normal School recently petitioned the Education Bureau to increase food expenses and improve their living conditions, with the following three demands: (1) The school's food expenses for this month remain at 196,000 yuan, while the price of rice has risen from 24,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan per斗 (a unit of dry volume), leaving only over 30,000 yuan for vegetables after paying for two斗 of rice, making it difficult to sustain. (2) After the adjustment of living expenses for civil servants in January, the students' public expenses should be 490,000 yuan per month. Please increase the allowance from this month onwards and make up for the difference that should have been issued in January and February. (3) In the future, when the cost of living index for civil servants is adjusted, student public expenses should also be increased accordingly.

### Speaking Up for Education (Continued from the 8th of last month)

— Mo Zhongyi

Second: "Education is not an ornament or monopoly of the wealthy; everyone has equal access to education. This is the minimum requirement of a democratic country." This is correct, but this responsibility cannot be borne by education alone. Considering China's national economic situation, even if primary school to university education were free and provided with public funding, it would still be impossible to ensure that everyone has equal access to a good education. In the past month, our national education or compulsory education, and adult literacy education were all free, and even provided books and stationery. However, those who ran these educational programs deeply experienced the difficulty of recruiting and retaining students. Children and youths in rural and urban areas had to work in the fields, in factories, and at home; they simply did not have time to attend school. For the sake of their family's livelihood, even if you waive their tuition fees and insist on their enrollment, it would not help their actual living conditions. They are genuinely willing but unable. Even in universities and middle schools, during the War of Resistance against Japan, loan and public funding systems were implemented. For several years, although they greatly helped impoverished youths, maintaining this system and hoping for equal access to university and middle school education is truly difficult in China today, before the national economy is improved. Judging from China's single-track education system, education is not designed for the wealthy. From the perspective of China's educational aims and policies, education does not have the flavor of being an ornament or monopoly of the wealthy. But in reality, China's current education does have the characteristics of being an ornament or monopoly of the wealthy. That cannot be blamed on education, but should be blamed on the unreasonableness of China's economic system. To blame education itself for this is unfair, and I cannot help but speak up for education. "As for the treatment of normal school students, it cannot be seen as the same as the public funding for ordinary students," and this has already been resolved by the Ministry of Education.

Graduates Have No Prospects, Is It Appropriate to Solely Blame Education?

Third: "Education hinders the development of social life." Mr. Zhang, based on his own experience, pointed out that receiving a middle school education does not necessarily earn more money than graduating from primary school, and graduating from university does not necessarily satisfy the family more than graduating from middle school. Therefore, he said that the only two paths for China's new intellectuals are to become officials or, if they cannot become officials, to teach, feeling that they have reached a dead end in life. Therefore, he believes that anyone can develop their talents and create a career in a certain environment, but Mr. Zhang, having received a university education, has lost the spirit and ability to create. He believes that this is due to traditional education—the education of books and literature—and that education is divorced from life, fostering a habit of not working, which hinders the development of social life. This kind of argument has long been mentioned by others. Proponents of productive labor education, vocational education, and social education often use this theory as a basis. However, this theory reverses cause and effect and is not consistent with the facts. In my view, modern education not only does not hinder the development of social life, but rather the lack of development of social life hinders modern education, causing education to suffer an unwarranted injustice. The purpose of education is not to teach people to make money, nor can it satisfy feudal ideas. Conversely, seeking a career or profit through education is the failure of education. The fact that China's new intellectuals have no prospects is not the fault of education, but the fault of society. If China's society is stagnant in all industries and educated people have no prospects, do those who have not been educated have prospects instead? If there is specialized knowledge but no place to use it, and this phenomenon of talent surplus is said to be the fault of education, then the only straightforward solution for education is not to exist. If education cannot meet the needs of society, then society should bear the greatest responsibility. If one expects education to cultivate talent on one hand and blames education for cultivating talent that has no market on the other, not only are those engaged in education at a loss, but even gods would find it difficult to help. In the current social environment of China, it would be a miracle if, as Mr. Zhang said, "anyone can develop their talents and create a career in a certain environment." Like Mr. Zhang, someone who "received a university education but lost the spirit and ability to create" did not suffer from education, but rather suffered from society. There are many university graduates who are promoted and become wealthy, and there are also many middle school students and primary school students, and even illiterate people, who rise to prominence. Is this the fault of education? To blame society's strange phenomena on education itself rather than on society is unjust and unfair.

Educators can be blamed for failing to instill a habit of labor in those who are educated, but to think that students' lack of labor habits hinders social development is not a fair argument. There are many laborers in China. It is estimated that farmers account for 80% of the country's population. Compared with educated people, the latter are truly rare. May I ask: What development of social life did China have before the implementation of new education? Education should cultivate various talents and have various facilities and environments. It is right that general education should not be divorced from daily life, but it does not matter if specialized education is divorced from daily life. A scientist or a writer who concentrates on his inventions or his creations, it is not surprising if his habits are divorced from daily life. As for criticizing traditional education as book education and literary education, that is also somewhat extreme. Mr. Zhang, can you create a new education system that does not use books or words? Productive labor education, vocational education, and social education have been promoted for more than a decade. The reason why there has been no significant progress is that trying to change education itself is like Sun Wukong trying to escape from the palm of the Buddha. The backwardness of social production, the stagnation of occupations, and the distress of the national livelihood make it difficult to develop education. This is truly the fatal wound of education. We can no longer reverse cause and effect and blame education.

Emphasizing Literacy Training Does Not Necessarily Stifle Individuality

As for Mr. Zhang's fourth point, that traditional education emphasizes the training of books and words, which stifles the individuality of young people and cultivates a group of bookworms and scholars, that is also not entirely true. Education cannot abandon books and words, as mentioned above. As for whether this stifles the individuality of young people and cultivates bookworms and scholars, that is also too arbitrary. Every school at every level, and even every school, inevitably has bookworms and scholars, and inevitably has students who skip school all day and have nothing to do with books. In my opinion, there are not too many bookworms and scholars like Mr. Zhang among the students in China today; on the contrary, there are too few. If education has stifled the individuality of Chinese youth, why was there the May Fourth Movement and subsequent student movements? I cannot understand this at all. Finally, Mr. Zhang complained that there is public funding available at university while his family at home is starving, and blamed this on education. Can education solve the problem of food for people other than those who are educated? Then education would truly be a panacea and an unsurpassed treasure. University graduates feel a sense of bleakness and despair about the future, which is due to the unreasonableness of politics and society, not the fault of education. Why do university graduates have prospects in other countries, while university students in our country are in despair? The reason is obvious. Considering that there is only one university student for every five thousand people in China, during a time of political stability, economic prosperity, and development in all industries, that is not enough no matter what. The fact that university graduates were reserved and snapped up by all sectors during the War of Resistance against Japan is clear evidence.

As for the shortcomings of education pointed out by Mr. Gu, the point about the examination system has been answered above. It is also not true to say that all levels of schools are preparing for further education. Of course, all levels of schools inevitably prepare for further education, but can you prohibit students' aspirations for further education? If it is said that students have few prospects after graduation other than continuing their education, then would creating an education system, such as a dual-track system, that prohibits a portion of students from pursuing further education solve the problem? To say that "education relies on the next higher level and fundamentally lacks its own independent personality" is not based on facts and is irresponsible. Elementary education implements national education, secondary education implements normal school education, vocational education, and middle school education to prepare for further education, and higher education implements specialized talent education. How can it be said that it "fundamentally" lacks its own independent personality? Mr. Gu concludes by saying: "Our current school education, other than being used for the wealthy to continue their education, is simply useless." I wonder if Mr. Gu has received "our current school education"? Are you "wealthy"? Are you "preparing for further education"? If there is one "no," then the statement that it is "useless" cannot stand. Even if you have received the current school education, you are wealthy, and you have already studied abroad and returned to your country after completing your studies, if there are many people who have received the current school education, but they are not wealthy, and they have not continued their education, but they still live in China and live in the human world, then the current school education should still be somewhat useful, right? China's education is often scolded by knowledgeable people. It is fine for people who do not understand education to scold it. But if someone in the education circle also wants to scold education to vent their anger, I think it is better to consider it first, so as not to be told by outsiders that you are too unambitious.

### U.S. Navy Basketball Team Flies from Qingdao to Shanghai This Morning; Will Play Qingbai at 7:30 Tonight; All Games Scheduled in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 1st] The U.S. Navy basketball team stationed in Qingdao, at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal Basketball Committee, is scheduled to fly from Qingdao at 10:00 AM on the 2nd aboard a naval aircraft and will arrive at Jiangwan Airport around noon.

### Social Affairs Bureau Stops Selling Rice in Markets, Resumes Free Trade; Market Sentiment Weakens, White Rice Drops by 200,000 Yuan Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The rice market resumed free trade yesterday. The authorities stopped selling rice in the market [because the government began to implement full rice rationing and prices in producing areas fell, etc.]. Market sentiment was weak, and most people remained on the sidelines, causing prices to fall by 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, 1,300 shi (a unit of dry volume) were registered as arriving in Nanshi, and 1,350 shi and five斗 in Beishi. Market prices: Special high-quality japonica rice was 2,900,000 yuan, white japonica rice was 2,800,000 yuan, thin indica rice was 2,850,000 yuan in Nanshi and 2,830,000 yuan in Beishi.

Mung beans declined, raw peanuts lacked buyers, and red sorghum was not being traded.

Edible Oil Declines

Although producing areas were not reporting small, tight credit conditions in Shanghai and the falling rice market forced sellers to liquidate and seek cash. Jiton brand peanut oil opened at 6,500,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 600,000 yuan. Local factory soybean oil was offered for sale by the factory at 5,700,000 yuan, with buyback orders at 5,600,000 yuan, a discount of more than 500,000 yuan compared to the previous market. Peanut oil, sesame oil, and Jiton small-cart oil each fell by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and soybean cake sales turned sluggish.

Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive

### Hua Stocks Recover Strongly After Early Weakness, Most Rise at Close

Hua stocks recovered strongly yesterday after early weakness. Tense credit conditions also eased. Banking firms numbered 168 and 232 selectively acquired American, Asian, and real estate stocks for investment purposes, showing notable activity. The overall trend suggested a slight recovery.

Early in the morning, unease prevailed in the market, and credit remained tight. Even news reports of a temporary delay in U.S. aid discussions had no impact, and stocks generally opened lower.

King Lun even reached the lower limit. Firms such as 76 took advantage of low prices to maintain later deliveries, and firm 36 purchased for immediate delivery. By midday, Wing On Textiles had risen to 958 yuan and 989 yuan. The final result was that, compared to last Saturday, King Lun shares, after hitting the lower limit for immediate delivery, recovered somewhat, with the fall reduced by half. Lai On, China Silk, King Fook, China Products, and Commercial Press fell by about 10%. Wing On Textiles, American Asian, Sino British, China Flourishing, New Light, Jia Fa, New China Matches, Wing Kung Underwear, Yung Foong, and Great Union fell by half a percent. United China rose to its limit, while the rest experienced slight declines. Later delivery shares: Keen Hing fell by 10%, while the rest fell by half a percent.

### Government Bonds Decline Slightly; Foreign Stocks Weaken

### Tea Market Lingers at Original Levels

Yesterday, the foreign merchant tea market remained calm due to weak activity from exporters. As for domestic sales, buyers from the local street and areas such as Soochow and Wuxi continued to purchase steadily, resulting in strong demand, and transactions remained consistent. However, the trend remained at the original level, without significant changes from last week. Although sellers intended to raise prices, there was a continued lack of stimulating news to boost confidence, making it difficult to improve the situation. However, according to general observation, with low inventory levels for all goods, there seemed to be no downward trend expected.

### Deadline for Applying to Purchase Compensatory Machinery at Fixed Price to Be Extended

According to Gu Baochang, Director of the Industrial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, only five private factories have applied to purchase Japanese compensatory machinery according to the fixed-price list to date, while more than fifty have applied to purchase without following the list. It is expected that the number will increase soon. The original deadline for applications, March 15th, will be extended until the machinery is sold out. The valuation of this batch of machinery has been handled by an evaluation committee, which will be established soon. The valuation standards will strive for fairness. Although this batch of machinery is already 40% cheaper than new machinery according to the Allied headquarters' assessed value, due to the hasty acceptance and inspection by our personnel, there may have been omissions, so it has been decided to further reduce the price. The applications for purchase will be compiled and reviewed by mid-next month.

[Our Dispatch] It was reported that Northeast circulation currency would be used at a fixed rate with legal tender in Guan Nei (within the Great Wall).

### Northeast Circulation Currency Not Used in Guan Nei

Regarding the report that Northeast circulation currency will be used at a fixed rate with legal tender in Guan Nei, President Zhang of the National Bank of China stated yesterday morning that it is completely inaccurate.

In addition, a senior official of the Central Bank confirmed that the Shanhaiguan branch continues to exchange circulation currency. All individuals entering Guan must exchange circulation currency for legal tender before entering.

### Buyers Watching and Waiting; Cotton Yarn Supply Exceeds Demand; Prices of All Counts of Coarse and Fine Yarn Fall

Yesterday's cotton yarn and cloth market was characterized by tight credit among industry players, leading to a sense of unease. Bulls frequently sold off, dominating the market, while buyers watched and waited, resulting in supply exceeding demand and prices falling sharply. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened at CN$108 million, but there were few takers. The last transaction was at CN$102 million, a drop of CN$20 million compared to the weekend. Spot and warehouse receipts for all other counts of coarse and fine yarn also experienced significant drops, ranging from CN$3 million to CN$8 million.

[Our Dispatch] China Textile Construction Company opened ten types of yarn yesterday, as usual, selling a total of 860 pieces, equivalent to 1200 pieces of 20-count yarn. The opening price for 20-count yarn was CN$57 million.

### Cloth Prices Decline

Yesterday's cloth market was characterized by strict inspections of warehouses and cloth dealers' accounts by yarn authorities, leading to unease. Furthermore, the sudden tightening of credit in the market caused transactions to stagnate. Only a few buyers from Hankou made sporadic purchases. The market was dominated by selling, and prices fell sharply. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at CN$2.60 million but fell all the way down to CN$2.42 million at the close, a sharp drop of CN$280,000 compared to Saturday. Other grades of fine cloth, serge, direct tribute cloth, and twill also fell sharply, ranging from CN$100,000 to CN$250,000, except for the stable local market for Swiss cotton.

### Woolen Fabrics Continue to Surge

The prices of woolen fabrics and serge have been surging daily, reaching unprecedented levels, with a total increase of more than 50% in the past week. The reasons for this sharp increase are mostly due to rumors and speculation. The soaring prices of rice and other commodities, as well as the increase in the cost of living, have also had a significant impact. Currently, retail transactions are being forced to halt one after another.

### Rayon Prices Plunge; Factory Transactions Quiet

The rayon market continued to decline yesterday. As those who ordered rayon with foreign exchange were required to pay customs duties today, demand suddenly stalled. 120's Asahi brand glossy rayon opened in the morning at around CN$38 million. The lowest price was CN$25 million for immediate payment, and the midday price recovered to CN$29.5 million for next-day delivery. The afternoon saw a slight rebound, with the final selling price at CN$31 million. However, this was still CN$12 million lower than last Saturday.

Factory transactions were quiet yesterday due to the sudden tightening of credit and the decline in rayon prices, leading to a wait-and-see approach. Prices for all grades were CN$4 million to CN$5 million lower than last Saturday. High-grade 00 was offered at CN$55 million for immediate payment, with no transactions. Mid-grade rayon also lacked transactions, and prices were CN$2 million to CN$3 million lower.

### The Rebirth and Support of Taiwanese Coal

(Continued from yesterday)

(3) Implementation of Loans: The loans currently offered by the association include two types: coal storage loans and production increase loans. Coal storage loans are provided to coalfields and railway stations to ensure that operators can continue production without financial difficulties. These loans are deducted from the purchase price, ensuring that producers have sufficient working capital to use without having to wait until delivery to receive payment. The total amount of these loans currently amounts to 1.2 to 1.3 billion CN$, approximately 120 to 130 billion legal tender, which provides considerable assistance to operators. Production increase loans are used to assist operators in expanding equipment, improving engineering, or developing new pits. These loans have been agreed upon with the Taiwan Bank, and will be offered at low interest rates starting this year. All those that are truly for production increase purposes can obtain this benefit. In addition, there are subsidies for new pit development, deep inclined pit subsidies, and long-distance coal transport subsidies, all of which are handled jointly by the association and the Department of Construction. The association also pays close attention to the welfare of miners. It has agreed with the Coal Industry Association to allocate 15% of the export surplus to miners' welfare funds, which are distributed and paid by the association. The association has also obtained approval from the Food Bureau to allocate low-priced rice, with all mining employees receiving 30 catties of low-priced rice per month. It is said that employees in other industries have not yet received this benefit. This is also a measure implemented by the association to stimulate production.

Based on the above, the rebirth of Taiwanese coal is not accidental, but rather the price paid by the joint efforts of all parties. (End)

### Last Month, Coal Transported to Shanghai Increased; Allocation Price Increased by 35%; Retail Price of Coal Balls CN$450,000 per Load

[Our Dispatch] According to the Fuel Control Committee, the total amount of coal transported to Shanghai from various places in February reached over 130,000 tons, including approximately 60,000 tons transported from Qinhuangdao, 9,600 tons transported from Tanggu, over 40,000 tons of Taiwanese coal, and 15,000 tons of East China coal, exceeding the total amount of coal transported to Shanghai in January by more than threefold.

Regarding the allocation price for this month, Minister Chen decided when he was in Shanghai to temporarily allow an increase of 30% to reduce the burden on public utilities and production industries. However, coal merchants from various places stated that the prices of flour and the cost of living have increased significantly recently, and that a 30% increase would not cover costs, requesting a change to an increase of approximately 60%.

It is understood that Minister Chen telegraphed the association at 3 pm yesterday, instructing an increase of 35%. After receiving the telegram, the association immediately invited representatives from various factories in Shanghai, including Kailuan and East China Huainan, to a meeting to explain the situation.

[Our Dispatch] The Fuel Group of the Shanghai Municipal Price Appraisal Council held its 20th appraisal meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs at 3 pm yesterday, deciding to adjust the price of machine-made coal balls to CN$7.8 million per ton at the factory, plus CN$120,000 for delivery. The retail price will be CN$450,000 per load, pending approval by Committee Member Wu Zhongren before implementation.

### Fuel Prices Soar

Yesterday's coal market was characterized by scarcity and low inventory, leading to repeated price increases. Jiaozuo white coal chunks rose sharply by CN$1 million per ton, to CN$13 million. Furong white coal was CN$7.8 million, Pingxiang bituminous coal was sold at CN$11 million, Datong was CN$12 million, Xuzhou coke was CN$8 million, and various other types of bituminous and white coal, as well as coal dust, also showed strength, continuing to rise by approximately 10% compared to Saturday.

The factory price of coal balls rose to CN$7.92 million per ton, and the retail price was CN$450,000 per load, an increase of 50% compared to the previous price.

The firewood and charcoal market was characterized by scarcity and brisk sales, leading to higher prices. Chestnut firewood rose to CN$200,000 per load, pine firewood was CN$171,000, green charcoal was CN$770,000 per load, and white charcoal was CN$610,000, also an increase of approximately 20%.

Learning Trends

### On the Totality of Scholarship

— Hong Qian

In the seventh issue of this publication, Mr. Yan Qun, in his article "From Concrete to Abstract," divides learning into two aspects: knowledge and action. "The learning of the knowledge aspect is modern pure natural science, and the learning of the action aspect is modern applied science." The subject of this article is to discuss the relationship between these two aspects of learning: Are they separate or a whole? Are they independent or a totality?

In the minds of most people, these two aspects of learning have fundamental differences, even opposition. The learning of the knowledge aspect focuses on theoretical research and exploration, aiming to establish a theoretical system or network for practical problems. The learning of the action aspect emphasizes "universal and economically practical application" in society, aiming for influence and impact on practical life. But is this a correct view of the relationship between the knowledge and action aspects of learning?

In my opinion, not only are pure natural science and applied science not independent or separable, but also the entire field of "learning" that emphasizes theoretical system research, such as philosophy, literature, history, cultural science, natural science, etc., and the entire field of "skill" that emphasizes social application, such as the application of theoretical research conclusions of all social sciences other than applied science in practice (such as "economic regulation" and business administration in economic science, and "population control" and "administrative organization" in political science), are all a complete totality. Please allow me to explain in detail:

The main reason why most people believe that scholarship lacks totality and completeness lies in the difference in "practical use" for society between the various branches of "learning" and the various branches of "skill." Such differences are not only easy to see within the scope of scholarship and technology, but also obvious within the same academic field. Don't we often hear that those who study the liberal arts are not as useful as those who study science? For example, those who study physics can always connect wires or install wireless electricity, and those who study biology can always identify poisonous pests. But not everyone who studies literature can carve seals or write antithetical couplets. The interest of the general public in philosophy is far less than that of fortune tellers and diviners in the neighborhood. However, those who study engineering are more useful than those who study science. Not only do they, like those who study science, have a superficial understanding and application of certain technological and industrial objects, but after they graduate, they can simply create many strange and wonderful things to solve problems related to clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other aspects of social life. For example, railways, steamships, automobiles, airplanes, sewing machines, telegraphs, telephones, electric lights, etc... There is simply no end to such examples.

This is how we see such a gap and such differences in "usefulness" between "learning" and "skill." However, when we look at the relationship between "learning" and "skill" from a principled or theoretical perspective, it is different. Why is science learning more useful than liberal arts learning in practice? Why is engineering learning more useful than science learning? From a principled or theoretical point of view, it is because the various objects of study in the liberal arts, science, and engineering can harmoniously assist each other, interact with each other, cooperate within the scope of the totality of scholarship, run in parallel without contradiction, and reach the same goal by different paths. For example, let's talk about "learning" located at the very top of all "learning" – that is, philosophy. Philosophy is the origin of European science, and science evolved from philosophy. The natural philosophy of the Greek era included both philosophy and science. The philosophers of that time were also the scientists of that time. The idealist philosopher Plato was a geometrician, and the materialist Democritus was the founder of atomism and also a scientist. Aristotle was naturally a great scientist in the early days of European science, and his view of natural science was followed until the Renaissance. The same is true of modern philosophy. Descartes was the discoverer of analytic geometry, Spinoza was an optician, and Leibniz was the discoverer of calculus at the same time as Newton. The great philosopher Kant was also a great scientist, and his nebular hypothesis can simply be compared with that of Laplace. Modern philosophers such as Lu Zhuo Feixile and Mach were either physicians, physiologists, or physicists. Contemporary philosophers such as Russell, Whitehead, Schlick, Carnap, and Weissmann were either mathematicians or physicists. The writings of the contemporary great scientist Einstein on philosophy are no less than those on pure science. In short, we have never seen any emphasis on one over the other in the liberal arts and sciences that has led to development in either. Nor have we seen a division of emphasis in the liberal arts and sciences that has led to their development. The facts are there, how can there be any doubt?

Having gained the above understanding about the impossibility of separating or isolating "learning" in the liberal arts and sciences, and the impossibility of judging them from the perspective of "usefulness," we can understand the significance of the totality of scholarship. However, if we turn our attention to the relationship between science and engineering, this point becomes even clearer and more thoroughly understood.

So-called engineering learning, or applied science, is actually the application of the principles of natural science in various practical aspects. For example, psychology and biology in medicine, physics and chemistry in pharmacy, mathematics, physics, and chemistry in industrial science, chemistry, biology, soil science, and meteorology in agriculture, and astronomy and oceanography in aeronautics and navigation. As for the utility of scientific methods in craftsmanship, there are metallurgical methods for extracting gold from gold minerals, the technical development of rubber materials and their derivatives, the electrochemical industry, and the improvement of steelmaking methods. In addition, many substances, such as indigo, were previously extracted from natural products, but are now manufactured using synthetic methods. There is also the use of inert gas in the air to make fertilizer, all of which can be used to prove this. Professor Wallace, in his book "The Wonderful Century," compared the practical applications of science in the centuries before the nineteenth century, and at the same time identified thirteen important inventions of the nineteenth century: railways, steamships, telegraphs, telephones, safety matches, gas lights, electric lights, photography, phonographs, X-rays, spectroscopic analysis, anesthetics, and antiseptics. In contrast, there were only seven in the previous centuries: telescopes, printing presses, compasses, Arabic numerals, alphabetic writing, steam engines, and barometers. Although Wallace's comparison of thirteen inventions in one century versus seven in previous centuries is too respectful of the nineteenth century and undervalues previous centuries, it can prove how the progress of science in a certain century is related to the actual inventions of that century. They are inseparable, like form and shadow.

Unfortunately, over the years, those who advocate "learning for application" have often overlooked the relationship between applied science and natural science, and believe that engineering learning has the possibility of independent development. They do not realize that engineering learning, as an applied science, cannot be applied without scientific theory as its basis and scientific methods as its aid, and it fundamentally loses its significance as an applied science. The discovery of conic sections by the Greeks was certainly not for practical use, but when we talk about the curves of bridges or bullets, or about navigation, we must think of this law of conic sections. A part of navigation is based on astronomy, and astronomy is based on Kepler's laws. But the central point of Kepler's laws is only that he was able to use deductive methods to infer from conic sections that the sun revolves in an elliptical orbit with the sun as the intersection point. Therefore, the astronomer Laplace once said: "If the Greeks had not discovered the tangent lines formed by the intersection of conical bodies, this accurate astronomical law would not have arisen." The steam power, telegraph, telephone, and power engines that are generally considered sufficient to change life all come from theoretical research in heat, electricity, and optics. Who knows that Thomson's mathematical analysis of the electrical vibration theory already has the foundation of wireless electricity. Galvani's research on frog leg spasms and Smith's exploration of English strata both came from theoretical curiosity. Although we know that one can be used to guide the development of telegraphs, and the other has a great effect on the exploitation of British mining, what are the actual effects? The method of spectroscopic analysis also comes from theoretical observation. Who knows that it can be used to discover that coal tar contains many mixtures, all of which are clear evidence of those who started without "practical use" and ended up with "practical use."

In summary, we can understand that "learning" and "skill" are fundamentally inseparable and independent, and that they are a complete totality. They are different expressions of academic research and essential contents of human cultural life. Therefore, countries and nations with truly developed scholarship all have special creations and inventions in both "learning" and "skill." Social environments with truly cultural lives also have spiritual traditions and practical skills in both "learning" and "skill." In the past, our country did not understand the totality of scholarship, so there was a time when we valued liberal arts learning and undervalued science and engineering learning, and at another time we did just the opposite. As a result, the promotion of either "learning" or "skill" over the past few decades has been deplorably poor. Therefore, a proper understanding and awareness of the totality of scholarship is a pressing need today.

### Comparing the Intelligence of Urban and Rural Residents After Bombings

— Fangzheng

The simple-mindedness of country folk has often been the source of jokes among city dwellers. Are rural people truly less intelligent than city people? In terms of achievement, there seems to be no doubt. In China, Pan Guangdan and Fei Xiaotong's statistics on the imperial examinations have already proven the superiority of urban dwellers. In the United States, psychologist J. McK. Cattell, in his "American Men of Science," compiled statistics on 866 scientists born in the U.S. Of these, 224 came from cities with populations of 25,000 or more in 1900. The total population of these cities was only one-sixth of the rural population, yet they produced over one-third of the scientists, clearly indicating that cities offer conditions more conducive to producing great scientists. But are these conditions artificial or innate? Cattell himself leaned towards the environmental explanation, attributing the differences in achievement between urban and rural populations to "population density, wealth, opportunity, social atmosphere, and ideals." We will discuss the reasons for this view below.

Since the rise of intelligence testing, there has been much research on the differences in innate abilities between urban and rural residents. Let us take the investigation by W.F. Book as an example:

Up to the age of fourteen, urban children consistently scored higher on average than rural children, with only 24% of rural children able to catch up with the average urban child. This seems to confirm the common belief that urban children are inherently more intelligent. After the age of fourteen or fifteen, rural children seem to catch up with and even surpass urban children. However, this apparent improvement is merely an illusion. The reason is that in rural America, most children no longer attend school after the age of fourteen or fifteen. Those who remain in school are the more intelligent ones, and the tests are conducted in schools. This selection effect makes it seem statistically that rural children outperform urban children. Therefore, the results of intelligence tests generally indicate that urban areas are superior to rural areas.

In Scotland, G.H. Thomson led an even more precise comparative study. He found not only that rural children had lower intelligence than urban children, but also that intelligence increased the closer one lived to the city and decreased the farther away one lived. (Of course, all of this refers to averages.) This degree of difference further supports the "Blood seeks environment" theory, which is widely accepted. In other words, the difference in intelligence between urban and rural residents is not caused by the environment but because the talented individuals in rural areas migrate to the cities, leaving behind those with lower abilities. This kind of selection is strongly advocated by proponents of heredity, and people like Pan Guangdan and Fei Xiaotong in China seem to have similar leanings. However, sociologists and social psychologists have recently presented strong counter-evidence. For example, Professor O. Klineberg of Columbia University, in his book "Race Differences," conducted studies on Black people that are difficult to explain in the same way.

Years of Black People Residing in Cities and Intelligence Chart

Intelligence is directly proportional to the number of years spent living in cities, which makes one question the theory of innate intelligence and believe that the urban and rural environments are the cause of differences in intelligence. Cities have convenient transportation, frequent social stimulation, higher cultural standards, and more educational opportunities, all of which can give an individual an intellectual advantage. Because cities offer better opportunities for cultured individuals, the public is also more enthusiastic about education, and everyone aspires to intellectual development. All of this demonstrates the stimulating effect of the urban environment on intelligence. But there is another important reason that past psychologists have overlooked: the materials used in intelligence tests are all taken from urban contexts, and some perspectives can only be understood by urban children. For example, one sentence-building test in intelligence tests is as follows:

Up Down I Village Go Early

The answer to this test is naturally "I go to the village early in the morning." But this tone is completely the tone of an urban child, something a rural child would never think of. Because the experience of rural children is only "I go to the city early in the morning" or "I go to the street early in the morning." It is not surprising that rural children fail in this type of intelligence test. If we were to choose living materials from rural children, using things commonly seen in the countryside to create the tests, the result might be that rural children have higher intelligence than urban children. In this way, we can no longer confidently say that the intelligence of rural children is inherently inferior to that of urban children. Different environments may be a more fundamental reason.

### What is Immortality

— Zuo Yu

"Immortality" or "non-death" is what everyone hopes for deep down, if it is possible. But what is immortality? Or what is the meaning of immortality? There are different answers to this question. Westerners have their answers, and Chinese people have their answers.

The Western answer is that immortality is the immortality of the soul. Only the soul has the possibility of immortality. This theory of the immortality of the soul has been advocated by the majority of people, from ancient Greek philosophers to modern Christian theologians. This is a major issue in Western metaphysics, which traditional philosophers must explain.

The Chinese answer is that immortality is the continuation of the life of descendants. The question of immortality is the question of whether or not there are descendants. If we have sons and grandsons, our life is entrusted to the life of our descendants, and it continues through the continuation of the life of our descendants. Descendants have descendants, and the life of descendants is infinite, so my life is also infinite. Therefore, Chinese people seek to have sons who can support themselves and carry on their ambitions and inherit their family business. The purpose is to solve one's own immortality problem. If descendants are similar to oneself in both body and spirit, isn't it that oneself has a second or third generation of life? Mencius's saying that "there are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest" emphasizes "having no descendants," perhaps for this reason.

In addition to the above two answers, there is also a third and fourth answer. These two answers seek immortality from the "effects" of life. Everything has an effect, and life must also have an effect. However, the effects of life can be divided into spiritual and material. In terms of the spiritual effects of life, this influence can be immortal. The so-called immortality of spiritual influence is the three immortalities of "establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words" in ancient China. These three immortalities are created by the spiritual activities of life and are unique to a few outstanding individuals, not everyone can have them. Although everyone must speak and act, not everyone's words and deeds can be immortal, that is, not everyone can make future generations be influenced by them and worship or commemorate them. Therefore, those who are able to be worshiped or commemorated by people today have obtained this kind of immortality. This is the most precious immortality.

In terms of the material effects of life, this influence is definitely immortal. The so-called immortality of material influence is caused by the fact that life is a kind of material activity. Once there is life, there is this fact, and this fact must have some influence on future facts. This is to say that any activity of a piece of matter must make the arrangement of atoms and electrons around it different, and this difference must make the arrangement of all atoms and electrons in the future still have some subtle differences. Therefore, as long as the universe exists for one day, this material influence will also exist for one day. This can be said to be the most lasting but also the most meaningless immortality.

Regarding the question of what immortality is, four answers have been proposed above: one is the immortality of the soul, the second is the immortality of having descendants, the third is the immortality of spiritual influence, and the fourth is the immortality of material influence. The first kind of immortality depends on whether there is a soul, and this is a question. The second kind of immortality may not be very reliable, because one does not have complete certainty about whether there will be descendants. The third kind of immortality is hopeful and requires effort. As for the fourth kind of immortality, it is effortless, the most reliable, but absolutely worthless. Therefore, if we want to pursue immortality, what we should pursue is the second and third kinds of immortality.

### Random Talks from the Academic World (11)

— Zhang Qiyun

National Construction Spirit and the Gan-Zhe Railway

Everyone is talking about national construction now, but national construction values practice over empty talk. Throughout my life, I have admired two Mr. Zhangs: one is Mr. Zhang Jian, who founded industries in Nantong, and the other is Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, who founded the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (originally named the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway). I once wrote an ode to Zhang of Nantong, which I will transcribe below.

"Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong lives in seclusion in Nantong, 'plowing in the fields of idleness, fishing on the shores of loneliness.' If bureaucrats and politicians were placed here, they would be unable to bear their worries, but Mr. Zhang is in a time of vigorous activity. Mr. Zhang believes that local autonomy must seek a foundation, and the best way to lay the foundation is to focus on land. In the twenty-seventh year of the Guangxu reign, Mr. Zhang started the Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company. People at the time praised his reclamation, turning barren land into fertile soil, worthy of competing with Duke Fan. The Fan Gong Dike in Jiangbei was built by Fan Zhongyan of the Song Dynasty, also known as the Sea Defense Dike, used to defend against the tides. It stretches through the counties of Ningyang, Yancheng, Dongtai, and Nantong, a total length of more than four hundred li. The dike site still exists today. After the Song Dynasty, the coastline rose, and the Fan Dike was one or two hundred li from the sea at its widest point and several tens of li at its narrowest. The land was barren and lacked dikes to defend against the tides, resulting in a desolate beach where no grass grew. At the beginning of his work, Mr. Zhang opened canals and rivers to facilitate irrigation, built dikes to prevent tidal disasters, and cultivated barren land that was difficult to plow, first planting light green seeds to transform the soil. In areas where thatch had already grown and the barren land had nearly exhausted its vitality, he recruited tenants to cultivate the land and plant cotton according to the suitability of the soil. In the thirty-first year of the Guangxu reign, a great storm surge occurred. Mr. Zhang personally inspected the sea and said, 'Do not be afraid! We will fight the storm surge with the blood and sweat of those who work and the shoulders of the scholars.' He also said that we must not be impatient, ten years to roughly define the scale, five more years to prepare the scale, and five more years to achieve the effect." Mr. Zhang's ambition was to reclaim 15 million mu of land, with each person occupying 20 mu, capable of accommodating 750,000 people. Although Mr. Zhang's plan has not yet been fully realized, from Nantong to Fuyu, large and small, there are no fewer than twenty new construction salt reclamation companies, and no fewer than tens of thousands of reclamation workers. The new villages and towns organized by the various companies are mostly densely populated, but because they have been established for a short time, many places are not yet recorded. 'Within each dike, there are houses for people to live in, rooms to entertain guests, warehouses to store goods, gardens to grow vegetables, huts for tenants, markets for merchants, and roads for travelers, like a small world.' People praised him, saying, 'Outside Fan Gong Dike, Zhang Gong reclaims land, filling the stomachs of ten thousand families.' Mr. Zhang's actions can make the world know that the Chinese are not entirely ignorant of agricultural reclamation plans."

"I once said, what is the difference between a politician of the new era and an old-style official? I believe that the old-style officials only focus on the relationship between people, while the politicians of the new era should focus on the relationship between people and nature. New-style politicians also talk about ingratiating themselves, but they do not ingratiate themselves with superiors and colleagues. What they want to ingratiate themselves with is the heavens above and the advantages of the land below. New-style politicians also talk about running around, but they are unwilling to run around to the doors of wealthy officials. What they are willing to run around to are rivers, mountains, and the vast wilderness, wanting to jointly plan the development of natural resources with the people, for the benefit of the country and the people. Based on this, I must consider Zhang Jian of Nantong to be the foremost practical politician of modern China." (Feelings of Eastern and Western Changes, Era Public Opinion, tenth issue, June 10, twenty-first year)

The Founding Father of the Republic, Sun Yat-sen, called the county the true foundation for building China. Zhang of Nantong's undertakings are indeed the foundation for national construction. The Founding Father also said that revitalizing industry should first prioritize transportation, and planning transportation should first prioritize railways. One latitude and one longitude, in terms of region, with counties as the basis, in terms of undertakings, with railways as the vanguard, this is the most profound saying for national construction. Among the many railway trunk lines in China in the past, the one that best embodies the spirit of national construction is the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, personally created by Mr. Zhang Jingjiang. Now, as the road holds the opening ceremony for the rebuilt Hangzhou-Nanyu section, I must say a few words in commemoration.

The spirit of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the spirit of hard work, quick action, practical action, far-sighted plans, and the ability to see the big picture and start from the small details, so that success can be achieved step by step. Now, our country is in a time of internal and external troubles, and the environment is extremely difficult, but construction is necessary to save the crisis. And current construction, without a spirit of hard work, will inevitably lead to complete helplessness, so the past experience of building the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is extremely valuable at the moment. The first section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, from Hangzhou to Jiangshan, called the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, was proposed by Mr. Zhang Jingjiang when he was the chairman of Zhejiang Province in the nineteenth year of the Republic. The construction of this road in March of the nineteenth year had only 200,000 yuan in construction funds. By July, it had reached Zhuji, and the difficult situation can be imagined. Mr. Zhang devoted his energies and devised a unique approach, laying thirty-five-pound light rails, aiming to save initial construction costs, but still not hindering future expansion and development. The average cost of engineering and equipment per kilometer of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was only 36,000 yuan, which was much cheaper than the cost of more than 90,000 yuan per kilometer for other state-owned roads. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was also extended westward from Jiangshan to Yushan in Jiangxi, called the Hangzhou-Yushan section, which was entirely built by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The route west of Yushan was jointly operated by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provinces. The term Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway began in the spring of the twenty-third year of the Republic. The Yushan to Nanchang section, 290 kilometers long, took one and a half years and was opened to traffic on January 15 of the twenty-fifth year, costing 18 million yuan. This section was rebuilt with sixty-three-pound heavy rails, so the cost was higher, averaging about 60,000 yuan per kilometer, which was not too much.

In the past, China's major projects mostly relied on foreigners. The construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and later the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway did not rely on foreign assistance or foreign capital. Chinese engineers did their own design. Except for steel rails, vehicles, machinery, and bridge materials, which could not be produced domestically and had to be ordered from abroad, domestic goods were used as much as possible within the possible range to reduce leakage. Although steel beam materials were not from Germany, they were distributed to domestic factories for contracting. Later, the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge still followed this consistent spirit, greatly strengthening the confidence of building the country independently. At that time, the government had financial difficulties and could not invest in railways, but the banking industry, which had available capital, was interested in investing due to the construction of the road. The road was also able to maintain its credit for foreign debt, so it was able to continue borrowing and expanding westward. The source of funds for the road was due to the cooperation and support of the domestic financial community. According to the report for the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, the entire road from Hangzhou to Nanchang, 660 kilometers, had a total of 4,000 employees, which was more streamlined than other roads. Senior leaders were able to work hard and self-discipline, serving as role models for all employees, and their service spirit was praised by the people at the time.

The construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was still during the period of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi. In addition to the banditry, it was also affected by floods and plagues. When the Nanchang-Yushan section started construction, the remnants of bandits in northeastern Jiangxi had not been cleared and often caused disturbances, even killing employees of the road and contractors, so the progress of the project was often hindered. Later, we contacted the local garrison for protection and built twenty-eight blockhouses along the road, stationing troops to guard them, so that the project could continue. At the same time, the peasants in this section had suffered from banditry and had also suffered from disasters, and were displaced and had no way to make a living. After consultation with the authorities, we did our best to organize work relief to help them. In total, about 2,000 people died from water, bandits, and plagues during the construction of the Nanyu section. Relying on clever strategies and the collective efforts, not avoiding difficulties and dangers, it was completed, which is also commendable.

The business policy of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is to promote domestic goods, in order to support the mission of revitalizing the domestic industry. Therefore, business offices were set up at important stations to facilitate the promotion of products from Shanghai-Hangzhou domestic goods factories, and transportation costs were drastically reduced in order to reduce costs, so as to compete with imported goods. As for the important specialties of various places along the line, Zhejiang-Jiangxi specialty exhibitions were held to promote them, and transportation and marketing cooperatives were organized at various stations along the line to collect transportation fees, concentrate goods, and set low, simple, and rational transportation prices and combined transportation methods for railways, highways, and waterways, in order to increase railway business and assist in the revitalization of the local economy. Railways are a tool, and their purpose is to improve people's livelihood and prosper the local economy. For the specialties of various places along the line, we should find ways to increase their production, improve their quality, and expand their market. Railways are not only a medium for developing inter-provincial trade, but also rely on the export of specialties for foreign trade, so railways should pay more attention to international trade. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau was able to pay attention to this point at the beginning of its establishment, which is a very correct policy. Systematic investigation of the economic geography along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line, precise estimation of industrial location, and multi-faceted support for various production enterprises, of course, still await continued efforts in the future.

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has a short history, and has been through wars and many obstacles, so we should not be satisfied with the existing achievements. But at present, various undertakings in the period of national construction often feel that although there are many plans, the perseverance to implement them is not enough. Therefore, I cannot but express my utmost admiration for the fighting spirit of Mr. Zhang Jingjiang and many of his successors.

### The Dilemma of Intellectuals

— Xuanxuan

Our intellectual class is out of touch. In the old days, it has lost the traditional rights of the scholar-officials. In the new era, it can only play a very small role in this capitalist society, such as small civil servants in institutions, clerks and documents in industry and commerce. As for pure intellectuals, such as writers, journalists, teachers, etc., economically speaking, they are just dependent figures. They are definitely not the chief executives, nor are they more "substantial" laborers. They mostly earn a meager living with a little skill that may or may not be necessary in this society. But society is too unstable. The more unstable society is, the less they can do, and the more pitiful they become.

I have a friend who used to work in literature and art. In recent years, seeing that there is no way out for literature and art, he switched to doing single-handed business. As soon as he did single-handed business, his face became rosier than before. There is also a friend who writes articles. Although his articles are not earth-shattering, in a civilized society, such works are definitely not too many. But now he sits in a securities firm every day, staring at the numbers on the quotation board. If he were born in the United States, at least his life would not be a problem. But in China, we do not need his sense of humor, nor do we need his wit, but he does need a job. Since he does not have a fixed job, speculation may be his only way out, although speculation is definitely not beneficial to society.

Ordinary intellectuals, of course, do not have outstanding knowledge. Maybe they just understand things a little more and know a little more about major events. But in China, a society where illiteracy accounts for more than 80%, they may have a great effect. Single-mindedness towards goodness may not necessarily bring peace to the country, but single-mindedness towards evil, people like Wu Yong and Niu Jinxing, can all be considered "scholars."

This is really an unbearable situation.

In this society, the more knowledge one has, the more one suffers losses. We do not need to deny this. But those in power cannot ignore this fact. Merchants with bloated brains can laugh at intellectuals for "deserving it," but those in authority must not think like this. They must at least do their best to make up for shortcomings and do a little "correction" to the status quo, so that the useful ones do not suffer too much. In the past, non-intellectuals suffered too much, and we have already experienced the consequences today. Now, if we go the other way, the consequences may be even more terrible.

### Reasons for Not Buying Books

On the 25th, Mr. Ze Shi published a great article titled "Chinese People and Books" in this publication, asserting definitively about Chinese people's reading habits, "This is because Chinese people do not like to read, which also means they lack the desire to learn." If this "Chinese people" refers only to non-civil servant Chinese, I dare not disagree for the moment, but if it includes civil servants, then to say they all "do not like to read" or "lack the desire to learn" is something I cannot accept. Why? Let me explain.

Although I am not yet a civil servant, I am the son of a civil servant. We come from a family of scholars. My father loves to read, and I also love to read. Therefore, I have indeed read some books. I wouldn't dare say I'm learned enough to fill five carts, but I have certainly consumed a lot of black and blue ink. Needless to say, we like to buy books. But have we actually bought any books? The answer is: a couple of months ago, I bought one or two, but for more than a hundred days now, I haven't bought even half a book. Why? Because I have no money.

We often see book reviews in the publishing sections of newspapers, and we want to buy them, but we have no money to buy them. We often see book titles in advertisements, and we want to buy them, but we have no money to buy them. We often flip through books in bookstores, and we want to buy them, but we have no money to buy them. We often discuss what books we want to buy, but in the end, we don't buy any books because we have no money.

Indeed, didn't Mr. Ze Shi's friend say, "My money for buying books comes from saving on things that can be spared or not. For example, if you are used to smoking white tin foil, why not switch to red tin foil, or only smoke four times a month, and use the saved money to buy a book? If you take rickshaws, switch to trams. If you are used to seeing first-run movies, switch to seeing late-run ones or not seeing them a few times. And so on. Such savings will not cause any loss, and there will be more than enough money to buy books." However, my family not only doesn't smoke white tin foil, but also doesn't smoke red tin foil. We can't even afford black tin foil. When we go out, we not only don't take rickshaws, but we also rarely take buses or trams. Most of the time, we still use "two-legged vehicles." As for movies, except for the few times I saw them on Sundays because I received some free military tickets from others, my family has never seen them. We don't even know what first-run or late-run movies are. Even so, we still have no money. The money we use is all for things that "cannot be spared at all." We have never used money that is "absolutely sparable" or "can be spared or not."

Let me calculate our expenses for you: my family has seven members, and my father's monthly income is less than four million yuan. However, we need about 1.3 piculs of rice per month. After deducting the ration of 0.3 piculs, we still need to buy 1 picul, which costs 2.45 million yuan (let's say 2.4 million yuan). Take this month as an example: apart from the 2.4 million yuan for buying rice, although I have public funding for university and don't need to pay tuition, I have one younger brother and two younger sisters in elementary school. The fee for each student in a municipal elementary school is 810,000 yuan, so three students cost 2.43 million yuan. This alone exceeds our monthly income by a lot. In addition, can we not buy side dishes? Can we not get haircuts? Can we absolutely not take trams? Can we not communicate with friends? Can we not take medicine when we are sick? Where does the money to buy books come from!

Therefore, the reason why civil servants don't buy books is indeed because of poverty, at least in my family. And I think there must be many families like mine!

Books, oh books, I want to buy you but have no money. I want to read you but have little time.

Regarding news about Mr. Chu Nanqiang, I received word from my old friend Fang Jiekang yesterday that he is still living in seclusion in his hometown and that they communicate regularly. This brought me great joy. Recently, after reading Mr. Shi's article, I learned that Jian Weng is still healthy in his old age. Although times have changed, the blessed land remains intact, and my old friend is strong. This is truly a great pleasure.

Around 1928 and 1929, the trend of developing famous mountains could be described as extremely popular. Wu Zhislao and Xu Jinglao developed Huangshan, Mr. Chu Nanqiang developed Liangdong, and Mr. Jiang Shunan developed Yanyan. They devoted themselves to opening up roads, renovating temples, planting trees, hosting tourists, publishing guides, and promoting these places with all their might. In particular, Mr. Chu and Mr. Jiang used their individual strength, persevering tirelessly, and were eventually able to greatly transform the scenic spots of Liangdong and Yandang. People admired their names and visited them in succession, and the two gentlemen often personally took on the responsibility of hosting these tours. Their enthusiasm and perseverance should be appreciated by the mountain spirits.

My visit to Yandang was due to the introduction of my old friend Huang Binhong. In the summer of 1931, I traveled south along the sea with my painting student Xu Peiji, entering the mountain from Yongjia Leqing. I received gracious hospitality from Mr. Shunan, and his son guided me throughout the mountain. I stayed in the mountains for a month, creating six albums of paintings, which marked the beginning of my on-site research on Chinese landscape painting sketching. To this day, Lingyan Lingfeng, Dalongqiu, Beishiliang, Jing Temple, and Old Monk Rock still bear the inscriptions I made at that time.

Mr. Shunan originally studied martial arts and possessed great talent and ambition. However, he obviously did not fit in with the times and was frustrated. He once annihilated more than 300 bandits in one fell swoop near his hometown of Dajing, clearing the banditry in the Yongjia area for several years. Mr. Shunan was generous in his drinking. His residences in Dajing, as well as Yantianwo in Yandang, were filled with liquor jars. One year, when Mr. Shunan came to Shanghai, he drank with Mr. Binhong at a certain hotel in Paoqiu Square. Each time a pot was emptied, it was placed on the seat. The two talked and drank, and the seat was filled with pots, but their enthusiasm had not waned. I couldn't drink and could only watch, but I already felt tipsy. I excused myself and returned home first. A few days later, I visited Mr. Binhong with Mr. Shunan on Ximen Road. At that time, there were several bottles of Moutai that a friend had given as a gift. The two resumed their unrestrained drinking, leaving only half a bottle. Mr. Shunan took it with him, also carrying a painting of Dalongqiu that I had made. Halfway to his destination, he accidentally dropped the bottle onto the car. When he picked it up, the bottle was broken, and the remaining liquor was about to spill. Unwilling to waste it, he drank it all in one gulp. By the time he arrived at his residence, it was all gone. He told me about it the next day, and we laughed together.

Now, Mr. Shunan's tomb is already covered with trees. Jiekang said that his eldest son has also passed away. In Yandang Mountain, there are now people gathering and causing trouble, making it impossible to revisit. Hearing that Mr. Nanqiang is healthy brings me joy, but remembering Mr. Shunan brings me grief. The most heroic and unrestrained people I have met in my life are undoubtedly these two gentlemen. Obviously, they were both unable to be of great use to the world and could only be with the mountains and forests. The misfortune of the two gentlemen is also the misfortune of the nation.

Chapter 11: A Bellyful of Doubts (85)

Qi Wan said, "Think about it, what era was it before, and what era is it now? If I don't know one or two influential figures of the time, I will be at the mercy of others. Especially with my position, I can easily offend people unintentionally." Zhu Qi was taken aback again and asked, "According to what you say, you are going to occupy a position in the opera world forever!" Qi Zhi smiled coldly and said, "If I don't work hard in my profession, what will this family eat and drink?" Zhu Qi saw that Qi Zhi's answer was completely contrary to her usual principles, and he was momentarily angry, saying, "Qi! I have always cared for you. No matter how your environment and your psychology change, I will protect you from going astray. Your association with such a person of questionable reputation is very detrimental to your status." Qi Zhi listened and remained silent. At this time, Little Wang's mother also came in and said from the side, "I think that Section Chief is very impatient. He curses people at the drop of a hat. I think the boss..." Qi Zhi glared at her before she could finish speaking and said, "Don't talk too much!" Little Wang's mother was scolded by her and lowered her head, not daring to speak anymore. Zhu Qi continued, "Whether this person is impatient or not, being with them is very unfavorable to you. Your status is different from others. When you bring out your reputation, who wouldn't respect you! Besides, your future is unlimited, and you don't need to rely on these martial arts friends to protect you! Now that this news has been published in the newspaper, people outside are talking about it. It will be troublesome to explain. I hope you pull back from the brink and don't make mistake after mistake." Qi Zhi said, "I have my own methods. I don't think there is anything wrong. I know that my reputation is very precious, and I won't involve others unless it is absolutely necessary." Zhu Qi saw that Qi Zhi's words were so decisive that she probably wouldn't accept anything more he said. He stood up angrily and said, "I am sincerely advising you. This matter concerns your reputation and your future. It doesn't have much to do with me." Qi Zhi said, "Of course it doesn't have much to do with you!" Zhu Qi said, "These are your own words. Then I have done my duty to advise you. Goodbye!" He said, walking away angrily. Qi Zhi ignored him, pursed her lips, and watched him leave. Little Wang's mother chased after Zhu Qi to the door, repeatedly urging him to come again tomorrow. Zhu Qi left unhappily. Little Wang's mother returned upstairs and saw Qi Wan crying next to her pillow!

### Life and Education

— Thoughts on the Tragic Murder of Professor Xu Shouchang

"I, Mr. Xu, killed him. You come and arrest me. I'll make it easy for you, but please agree to my demands. First, my parents are very poor. I have more than ten thousand Taiwan dollars and a watch. Please send someone to my house. Second, let me write a letter to my parents. If you don't agree, I will never admit it, or I will commit suicide."

"The prison warden agreed to his request, and he wrote a letter home, mainly saying: 'I am ashamed of you two elders. Don't think about me after this inhumane act. The education I received was also wasted. Please burn all the books I read before!'"

The case of the assassination of Xu Shouchang, director of the Chinese Department of National Taiwan University, has been solved. The murderer, Gao Wanche, turned out to be a young worker. Because this house used to be the Taiwan Provincial Translation Hall, the murderer kept a key to the gate. He entered the room in the middle of the night to steal, but Mr. Xu discovered him in bed with a flashlight. In a moment of desperation, the murderer pulled out a firewood knife and struck a vicious blow. A scholar who tirelessly taught and wrote extensively died tragically under the blind and arrogant consciousness of the murderer. This is a most painful and tragic event!

According to reports, the murderer was very afraid and remorseful after killing Mr. Xu. Therefore, after being arrested, he admitted: "I deserve to pay him with my life." Alas! National essence is gone. To use a straw bag to pay with his life is truly like comparing Mount Tai with a feather. What can it compensate for?

The motive and beginning of this tragic case are actually simple, entirely based on poverty and ignorance, leading to the act of violence when the theft was discovered. Gao Wanche deserves to die. However, when he was arrested, he never forgot his parents, giving the remaining money and watch to them. Furthermore, he realized that "the education I received was also wasted, please burn all the books I read before!" After all, people are people. Sometimes they go against reason and act unlawfully, and sometimes their conscience awakens, and they face death as if returning home. Gao Wanche is an example of the intensification of life's contradictions.

Mr. Xu Shouchang was a pure scholar, respected for his articles and morality. He also devoted himself to education and did not talk about politics. His death this time is even more regrettable! And what is most moving is what the murderer said - "The education I received was also wasted, please burn all the books I read before!" Gao Wanche probably felt, after knowing his crime, that education was ineffective and that he had lived in vain!

Education! Education! What kind of "thing" is education in today's world? The whip of life forces educated people to go astray, unable to extricate themselves. After the case of Xu Shouchang's assassination has been revealed, we grieve for the unjust death of the deceased, and also for the vain life of the living. We especially grieve for the bleak and colorless future of education!

### Flower Affairs Novels and Wei Chun Garden

— Yu Yifen

In Mr. Liu Yan-sheng's article "Old Scenes of Shanghai" published in this newspaper on the 20th, it stated, "As for the flying carriages surrounding beautiful women, we can see the scenes of that year in the Nine-tailed Turtle written by Haishang Shushi Sheng and the Shanghai Flower Records written in Shanghai dialect." This is a mistake. According to Mr. Zhang Chunfan, the author of the Nine-tailed Turtle (whose name is the same as Zhang Chunfan, the husband of Xiao Dangui), also known as the Master of Shushu Liushanfang, the protagonist Zhang Qiugu is actually a self-portrait. I used to meet him several times with my teachers Han Yunlin and Wu, he was stout and short-sighted, a dignified elder, and he did not seem like the romantic and unrestrained character in the book. As for Haishang Shushi Sheng, it is the alias of Mr. Sun Yusheng. He wrote Shanghai's Prosperous Dreams and the martial arts novel Five-flower Sword of Immortals and Knights. He indulged in pleasure in his youth, but after middle age, he stopped visiting entertainment venues and was able to maintain a light figure and remain vigorous in old age. He founded the Prosperous News, which was the beginning of small newspapers in Shanghai. He especially encouraged young people. I first met him in the winter of Guihai and considered him a friend despite the age gap. He died of illness in Shanghai during the war at the age of eighty-odd. The author of the Shanghai Flower Records is Flower Also Pitiful, who first wrote the book in Suzhou dialect, which is a unique style in fiction. After being promoted by Hu Shih, the name began to be famous. The Dream of Prosperity and the Nine-tailed Turtle also use Suzhou dialect, which became popular after publication, so there are many sequels. I used to enjoy entertainment and liked to pay attention to the past events in this area. I wish I could read all three books to the end, but the volumes were too long.

Flying carriages should refer to horse-drawn carriages. At that time, the most popular were steel wire double-axle covered carriages, called Hansoms (a transliteration of the English word "pretty," which is what Shanghai people call Yangjingbang). Famous courtesans were taken out on outings, often acting as drivers themselves. The destination was Ankaidi in Wei Chun Garden in western Shanghai. Every time the sun was setting and the lanterns were not yet lit, the silk fans and gauze dresses fluttered as they arrived, and the jeweled carriages and beaded curtains arrived one after another, enjoying the coolness and expanding their views. It was truly the unrestrained emotions of rouge and powder and the grand occasion of women's ornaments. Among the courtesans, Lin Daiyu, Jin Xiaobao, Zhang Shuyu, and Lu Guanfen were known as the Four Beauties, obviously carrying the dragons and elephants among them, indulging in flowers and the moon, extremely fascinating for a time. In the garden, you could often see the shadows of their whips and hairpins. Wei Chun Garden was the property of Zhang Shuhe from Wuxi. The world has changed, and the garden can no longer be seen, but even today, the area around Jing'an Temple Road and Moore Ming Road is still called Zhang Family Garden. (Editor's note: "Ting Simei" seems to come from the English word Hansom, which originally meant a changing wheel carriage. Mr. Yu's so-called "pretty" should be Handsome. It is unknown which one is correct, so both are recorded.)

### My School Friends

— Xue Xueyuan

I was deeply touched by Mr. Sun He's article "Memories of Ling Yange" published in the Free Talk section of February 5th, and I regret that I don't know exactly who Mr. Sun is. "Sun He" I think is a pen name (the original article said it was a teaching colleague, but it was not clear which school). The record is truly methodical, stable and detailed, and there are also one or two misrememberings. I am from "Peking University" rather than "Beiyang". This matter relates to my academic record, so I must clarify it. Now, I will talk about my school and my school friends.

My school "Peking University" is not slang. It can be called the foremost, oldest, largest, and highest institution of higher learning in the country, from the Imperial University of Peking (the pre-Qing translation name Imperial University) to Peking University (the Republic of China translation name Government University, later changed to Peking University). From its founding in the year before the founding of the Republic of China to today, it has been celebrating its 50th anniversary. Before and in the early days of the Republic of China, there was only this one in the capital, and it occupied the same lofty position as the "Taixue" in ancient history (that is, the Imperial College, which represents the national school). Therefore, when "University" or "University student" was mentioned, everyone knew it, and there was no need to add a prefix, like the "Bald General without a Character" in history. As Liu Jin said in the play "Famen Temple", "This job is enough to obtain!"

The historical evolution of my school can be divided into three periods: (1) When it was founded 14 years before the Republic of China, it was only because the capital needed a lofty and large school, and it did not consider what conditions a university should have or what level university students should be. Moreover, primary and secondary schools had not yet been established, and there were no students who were promoted level by level, so there could not be qualified university students who could apply. Therefore, teachers and students were very complex, including Jinshi and Juren from the old imperial examinations, and mathematics and astronomy students from Tongwenguan. The curriculum and subjects were also arbitrary. The so-called "University" was just a "Large School," not a "University" in the sense of the word. It was not until the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences University three years before the Republic of China that it became a real university. This is the first period. (2) The second period was from the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences University to the reform in 1919, when the New Culture Movement occurred. After the reform in 1919, it entered the third period, until today. (In the past 30 years, some changes have occurred due to political changes, such as the restoration of the "Imperial University of Peking" during Zhang Zuolin's time, which are not enough to be called stages, and will not be discussed.)

I was one of the first students admitted to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences University. There were more than 500 students in the seven departments. Now, let me first mention a few of our civil engineering classmates. The one with the best graduation performance was Xia Changchi (Zi Guangyu, from Qingpu, Jiangsu). He worked in the Ministry of Communications in Beijing for several years. After the capital moved south, he also undertook many famous projects in the south. After the victory, he was also appointed as the transportation rehabilitation supervisor and commissioner in the central China area. (Last year, I saw in the newspaper that this name or title was not entirely consistent with the original title.) I think there are many people who know him in the north and south of the Yangtze River. This old classmate, Brother Guangyu, was gentle and refined in his youth, and very diligent. He always ranked first in the big exams, and we jokingly called him "Xia Zhuangyuan". After the "September 18th" incident, he visited me once and we had a long conversation. It has been many years since we last met. There were also Ye Shenxiu (named Yongbao, from Suzhou, civil engineering) and Wang Jianqing (from Changzhou, mining). Both brothers graduated from Suzhou High School and entered Peking University. Those who came from Guangdong were Lao Qu (his Nick name was Potatoe), Lao Chen (Boyu), Lao Li (Wenji), and Lao Li (Boxian), Lao Mai from the mining class, and Lao Wu (Cifeng), Lao Zhang (Litang) who graduated from Shandong High School. They have always served in the engineering field in central and southern China. Recently, I received a letter from Lao Zhang forwarded by the editorial department of this newspaper. He saw the text about Ling Yange and the Faculty of Engineering of Peking University in Gansu while reading the Shen Bao, and only then did he know that the old classmates were safe. They are now working in the Lanzhou-Tianshui Railway Engineering Bureau, healthy as usual. I have other letters, but the journey is far away and there is no fixed shipping date, so I will add a few words here and ask him to convey my thoughts to a dozen or so older classmates.

At that time, there were many students in the seven departments (which would be called seven colleges according to the current system), and it was difficult to know them all. Especially the many friends in the liberal arts and law departments did not have academic exchanges with us engineers, and we did not have time to identify them. It was not until a few years after graduation, when I myself changed careers, that I had the opportunity to meet a few people through other social occasions in the political, academic, and journalistic circles. After being introduced by others, I realized that they were the classmates who took the same entrance exam. I will not explain them one by one here. I will only mention two "famous people". One fragrant and one stinky, one alive and one dead. The fragrant one, the living one, is Lao Liu (named Zhe, Zi Jingxing, from the Northeast), who is currently the vice president of the Control Yuan, with a high position. He often recites the sentence "Many classmates in their youth were not lowly," and Brother Jingyu is worthy of this sentence. He was Minister of Education in 1927. I was teaching in two universities, and our positions were far apart, so we never communicated. In 1935, when he was a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee, I met him a few times at the press reception. When we talked about the old days of Ma Shen Temple, we were filled with emotion. And now we have experienced more vicissitudes. The stinky one, the dead one, is Liang Hongzhi, a well-known traitor, one of the leaders of the puppet Reformed Government, who has been punished by the national law and his reputation has been ruined. He brought it upon himself, and I cannot bear to mention it. This person once served as the "President of the Puppet Supervisory Yuan." Brother Jingyu's academic friendship with this person is closer than mine. The two supervisory councils, one true and one false, also show that Brother Jingyu must have a deeper regret and joy for Liang's talent and bad behavior.
