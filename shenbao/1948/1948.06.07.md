### Minister of Finance Plans to Open New Tax Sources to Balance Revenue and Expenditure in the Second Half of the Year, Considering a One-Time Property Tax

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] The new Minister of Finance, Wang Yunwu, has already begun calculating and planning the national revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of this year. After Wang's arrival at the ministry, he separately spoke with the heads of various responsible units to study the possible amount of revenue for the second half of the year and planned to open up new tax sources. Wang instructed the heads of responsible units, especially the heads of tax authorities, to first conduct detailed research and planning. A meeting will be convened in the coming days specifically to discuss how to balance revenue and expenditure in the second half of the year. According to rough estimates from relevant sources, the budget for various tax revenues in the first half of the year is over 30 trillion yuan, but the commodity tax revenue may reach 50 trillion yuan. The income from the disposal of enemy and puppet materials is approximately 20 trillion yuan. However, after offsetting revenue and expenditure in the first half of the year, there is still a 50% shortfall. The total national revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of the year is projected to reach 200 trillion yuan in tax revenue. However, based on estimates of the inflation rate in the first half of this year, total expenditure in the second half of the year may reach × hundred trillion. The gap between revenue and expenditure is still significant. In addition to planning to open up new tax sources, Wang also plans to use the following methods to increase national income: (1) Sale of state-owned enterprises; (2) Disposal of enemy and puppet materials; (3) Disposal of Japanese reparations materials; (4) US aid. The aim is to gradually bring revenue and expenditure closer to balance. According to Wang's calculations and planning over the past few days, there will still be a considerable gap after offsetting revenue and expenditure. In recent days, he has been considering various ways to make up for the shortfall.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] In order to plan for increased national income and save the current economic crisis, Wang Yunwu is currently considering a one-time property tax, so that those with money can use their excessive profits to compensate for the national financial crisis. Wang is determined to implement a one-time property tax, believing it to be the only way to open up new tax sources. However, he believes that the implementation technology is very difficult and requires detailed study. Wang met with a tax official on the 5th and discussed this matter.

### Leighton Stuart's Statement is Directed at Semi-Official Circles

Opinions of the Acting President of Yenching University

[Our Beiping Office, 5th Dispatch] Lu Zhiwei, the acting president of Yenching University, said: Ambassador Stuart's statement is mainly directed at the semi-official opposition to the United States supporting Japan, and the relationship with intellectuals or students is likely to be less.

The next morning, four bodies were found in the area. One of the deceased had a diary with reactionary slogans and songs. However, since no units in the Andong area were dispatched to kill the bandits, it is generally speculated that they were killed in internal conflict by the remnant forces of the rebel Chu Guibin.

They released Chen Qinru and demanded hundreds of millions of dollars from his son, setting a ten-day deadline for the ransom, after which they would tear up the ticket.

Escaping from the Bandit's Den, A Letter of Blood and Tears, Communist Bandits Brutally Massacre the People, Reaching the Most Severe Stage [Times News Agency, Nanjing] Our agency recently received a letter of blood and tears from Mr. Sun, a 62-year-old. In the letter, he poured out the suffering he endured in the bandit area. The full text is as follows:

Dear Editor: I am a refugee who recently escaped from the communist bandit den in Feixian County. I am a family member of a soldier in the War of Resistance. I am 62 years old. My son, Sun Peiyuan, and my second son, Sun Fuyuan, both graduated from the Central Military Academy and joined the army to fight against the Japanese for eight years. My second son served in the expeditionary force in Burma. After the victory, they both sent letters home. At that time, my eldest son was a lieutenant colonel in the Chongqing Military Officers' Corps, and my second son was a major staff officer in the 9th Brigade of the 9th Division. Later, as the communist banditry in our county intensified, news was cut off. Because I am a family member of a soldier in the War of Resistance, I was even more resented by the communist bandits. They insisted on giving me the title of "stubborn" and maliciously sending me the Kuomintang emblem. They made me wear a grass rope and parade through the streets, wearing a paper hat, gathering crowds to mock me, beating gongs and drums, like a monkey in a show, beating, spitting, scolding, like scolding cattle and horses, using thousands of methods to insult me in every possible way. As for houses and fields, they were divided and distributed after struggle sessions. Food, clothing, and household items were looted by instigating mobs. Movement was restricted, and neighbors were not allowed to interact. Speech was punished, and no relatives dared to inquire. Even the slightest carelessness or violation would result in heavy beatings or even death.

I was living in a deep abyss, truly suffering the pain of wanting to live but being unable to, wanting to die but being unable to. Recently, the Mao bandits have intensified their cruelty, and the massacres have reached the most severe stage, extensively implementing the "Three Cleans" and "Three Checks." The "Three Cleans" are: Clean Background, Clean Class, Clean Bloodline. The "Three Checks" are: Check Ideology, Check Tendency, Check Work. All those who were classified as landlords, regardless of gender, were killed. Intellectuals, regardless of age, were not spared! The bandits' intention is to exterminate mankind to satisfy their desire for massacre. Recently, during the pilot implementation period, news of those being investigated and brutally killed is heard every day. Although I have suffered countless struggles and insults, I was still unable to escape. Last December, I was dragged by bandits to a public square. A crowd of bandits gathered, and with a shout, they began punching, kicking, and beating me with sticks. In an instant, I lost consciousness and fell to the ground. When I regained consciousness, I was already in the bandit's prison, awaiting death. As for the bandits' methods of killing – there is the "Viewing Platform," the "Single-Log Bridge," the "Toad Jumping Pit," the "Monkey Climbing Pole," all kinds of cruel punishments, too many to count. Anyone with a little humanity would be terrified upon hearing them! In the bandit's prison, I could only wait for my neck to be stretched out and die, as there was no hope of survival. I thought to myself that when the bandits held a public trial, I would not know what kind of cruel punishment I would suffer before dying. Fortunately, the National Army went to suppress the bandits, and the bandits fled in panic. I seized the opportunity to escape to Gaojia Village in Sishui County. My family of six also fled with the army. After nine deaths and one life, we were fortunate to see the light of day again. However, with seven old and weak people, we are adrift in a foreign land, without clothes or food, suffering from hunger and cold. Having just escaped the tiger's mouth, we are now facing the difficulties of hunger and cold. Therefore, I poured out the suffering I endured in the bandit area in this blood-soaked letter, so that young people will know the communist bandits' inhumanity and not be seduced by their sweet words. I also hope that my two sons will see this letter and find a way to help us so that we will not starve to death. If there are any kind gentlemen, or my son's former commanders, or friendly colleagues or classmates who know their recent whereabouts, please give us a message. The sincerity of our gratitude cannot be expressed in words. With best wishes for your well-being. The 62-year-old Sun Baojun wrote in tears

New Shandong Style: Everything for the People, Wang Yaowu Elaborates on Specific Content [Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] Chairman Wang Yaowu held a simple dinner with one dish and one soup for reporters from this newspaper on the evening of the 4th, after returning from Nanjing. During the dinner, he elaborated on the reasons for his request to resign, his feelings upon returning, the specific content of the new style movement he is promoting, and future measures concerning the military and political situation in Shandong.

He first told reporters that he originally made the biggest determination to resign due to various reasons. My own plan was to suggest to the central government that after I resign from my current concurrent positions, I hope to be able to select three reorganized divisions and have the central government assign two more reorganized divisions to form a mobile corps dedicated to fighting the main force of the communist bandits. Wherever He Hu (a commander) reports an emergency, they will be reinforced there, becoming a stabilizing force. I am absolutely willing to endure hardship to serve the leader and the country. The highest authorities expressed approval in principle for this suggestion, but the focus of the problem was that there were no suitable successors. Therefore, after my firm resignation was not accepted, I had no choice but to come back and jump into the "Mao pit" (a Shandong dialect term meaning "not pretty"). Since my resignation was not approved, the central government has agreed to strengthen the military strength of Shandong and supplement Shandong's forces.

I have many feelings after returning, but the most important of these is first, change, but it must change in a good direction in order to survive; second, research, researching how to change in a good direction; third, quick action, after the goal of change is determined, we should carry out the task with a spirit of quick action; fourth, self-reliance.

Chairman Wang then elaborated on the new style movement he is promoting after his return. He analyzed the overall goal of loving the people and being close to the soldiers in great detail. For the former, we must achieve (1) taking the people as the foundation of the country, everything is for the people, and military, government, and educational personnel are serving the people; (2) overthrowing all corrupt and evil ideas, traditional bad habits of exploiting the people, preying on the people, and sacrificing the people, and immediately mobilizing for the benefit of the people; (3) officials who neglect the interests of the people and hinder the lives and livelihoods of the masses should be given absolute power to be sanctioned; (4) our officials should supervise each other, learn from each other, and encourage each other. For the latter, we must achieve (1) the widespread accumulation of bad habits among commanding officers, such as the disparity in life between officers and soldiers and the lack of demonstration, leading to poor discipline and demoralization; (2) commanding officers should treat soldiers like parents treat their children, with love, protection, and the natural and obligatory duty to care for them; otherwise, they are not standard commanding officers and should be abandoned by the masses; (3) the specific items of being close to the soldiers include living frugally, sharing weal and woe, cutting down on extravagant expenses, enriching nutrition, encouraging the excellent, and sanctioning the dregs. Among the methods of implementing the new style, he especially emphasized integrity and resolutely decided to crack down on corrupt local bullies, hoping for the support of the media. Regarding land reform, it was decided that "three-one rent payment and land grant to soldiers" will be achieved this year.

Finally, Chairman Wang answered reporters' questions. The Shandong Provincial Government will undergo a partial reorganization in the short term, and there is absolutely no problem with the security of Jinan. In fact, I have completed all preparations. Not to mention three or five communist bandit columns coming to attack, even ten columns can be handled with ease. Regarding the entire suppression of the rebellion, due to the change in the National Army's strategy, we will adopt mobile warfare as much as possible in the future. In addition, a large number of new troops will be trained and completed in the short term, so the entire situation should be completely changed soon.

Director of Civil Affairs Liu Xiang Firmly Resigns, Personnel Decisions Will Be Partially Adjusted, Director of Civil Affairs Liu Xiang Firmly Resigns, Peng Guodong Internally Appointed as Successor [Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] The personnel of the Shandong Provincial Government will be partially adjusted. According to sources, Director of Civil Affairs Liu Xiang is determined to resign due to the arduous situation in Shandong and his weak health. Peng Guodong, former director of the Southwestern Shandong Administrative Office and now a member of the Provincial Council, has been internally appointed as his successor.

Failure to Obtain Soviet Cooperation in Currency Reform, West Germany Will Implement It Alone, Allied Control Council in Berlin May Reopen [Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Reliable sources indicate that the Soviet Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Sokolovsky, convened his main financial and political advisors at his Berlin headquarters on Monday. German political figures close to the Soviet military government believe that this meeting will determine the Soviet Union's attitude towards the currency reform that West Germany will implement this month. It is expected that the Soviet authorities will make one last preparation to reopen the Four-Power talks to discuss the currency reform of the entire Germany. Political figures pointed out that the German-language Berlin Night Express, registered with the Soviets, recently published an editorial calling on the French Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Koenig, to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council before June 15th. It is rumored that June 15th is the deadline for the implementation of currency reform in West Germany. Political figures believe that the Soviet Union itself is unwilling to take the initiative to reopen the Allied Control Council meeting, but if it is convened by another power, the Soviet Union would be happy to participate. French officials here also expressed their belief that the Allied Control Council is expected to be convened on June 10th, which would be the first meeting of the Allied Control Council since Sokolovsky withdrew from the Allied Control Council on March 20th. People from all parties in Germany are also eagerly hoping that the Allied Control Council can reopen its meeting, believing that this is the last chance to avoid East and West Germany from implementing currency reform separately, so as to prevent Germany from falling into a confirmed split state.

According to a very reliable report from the Soviet-occupied zone, Soviet-led groups and authorities there have begun to adopt a policy of easing and ingratiating themselves with the Germans. Since June 1st, police checks on passengers on highways and railways have been greatly relaxed. Free German labor movement personnel controlled by the Communist Party have gone to various parts of the zone to visit church people, volunteering to cooperate with the church in the planned social reform program. Another group, the Farmers' Association, also suddenly reduced its political propaganda and devoted itself to rural revitalization programs. It is generally believed that the purpose of the Soviet Union's policy is to win people's hearts and unite as many Germans as possible to form a national front in preparation for announcing the establishment of East Germany to counter the West Germany that the Western Allies will establish.

[United Press, London, 5th] Diplomatic officials said that the Western countries intend to immediately reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to establish a sound and unified currency system in the entire Germany for domestic and international trade. The details have not yet been revealed. The chances of success of this action can be seen in the fact that the Soviet Union and the Western countries have strongly argued for the need for a unified currency system. The United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have established a new agreement on this matter. The Soviet Union recently condemned the Western powers, especially the United States, for undermining the Four-Power Berlin talks on German financial reorganization. The United States and Britain have denied these accusations. In recent weeks, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Military Governor of Germany Clay have expressed their hope to promote a national new currency. If the Soviet Union opposes this request or wants to shelve it indefinitely, it is said that the Western countries will proceed with the currency reform plan for West Germany alone.

Vandenberg Will Make Every Effort to Restore Original Foreign Aid Amount, Preparing to Attend Senate Appropriations Committee to State Opinions [Reuters, Washington, 5th] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today, requesting permission to attend and testify, presenting his opposition to the reduction of foreign aid expenses. Vandenberg's move shows that he will personally lead the Senate's efforts to restore foreign aid expenses after they were reduced by the House of Representatives. Vandenberg's friends revealed that the foreign aid bill was passed by Congress, largely due to Vandenberg's efforts. Now that he has heard that the House of Representatives has passed a reduced appropriation案, it is like a major blow to him, so Vandenberg is doing his best to restore the original amount.

According to State Department officials, the reduction in the Marshall Plan's expenses was affected by the recent Soviet peace offensive. The Soviet Union's peace offensive has eased the international tensions of recent months, so the House Appropriations Committee believes that it is not necessary to allocate such a huge amount of money to aid other countries. Therefore, State Department officials have been lobbying in the congressional lounge for the past 36 hours to correct the over-reliance on the Soviet peace offensive and the resulting situation. It is generally believed that some of the expenses reduced by the House of Representatives have no hope of being restored to their original state. Even if the Senate resolves to maintain the original amount, the final result can only be a compromise between the amounts approved by the House and the Senate. The consequences of the reduction in foreign aid are not limited to one aspect. The most important one is the impact on the United States' foreign policy based on the Marshall Plan. Marshall has already stated that after the reduction, the reconstruction plan will only become a relief plan. Many members of Congress seen in the Capitol area are serious, showing their importance to the reduction of foreign aid. Since the Republican National Convention will be held in Philadelphia on June 21st to elect presidential candidates, the congressional session is very rushed. If the situation falls into a serious state, Truman, who has already set off on a national campaign tour, may rush back to Congress to issue a warning himself.

Foreign Trade Agreement Act, Term Should Be Extended, Marshall's Advisor Expresses Opinion [Marshall's Advisor Expresses Opinion] [Reuters, Washington, 7th] Former Deputy Secretary of State Clayton, Special Economic Advisor to Secretary of State Marshall, testified before the Senate Finance Committee, solemnly warning against accepting certain restrictions added to the Foreign Trade Agreement Act that has already been passed by the House of Representatives. He pointed out that these restrictions would kill the reciprocal trade plan created by former Secretary of State Hull. Clayton earnestly urged the Senate Finance Committee to overturn the House's resolutions that have been passed to limit the extension of the bill to a maximum of one year, and to limit the president's power to negotiate tariff reduction agreements with other countries. He requested that the government's requested three-year extension be maintained. He pointed out that among the sixteen countries that have accepted Marshall Aid, Austria, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Denmark, and Ireland have not yet signed reciprocal trade agreements with the United States. If the extension is only for one year, it will not be possible to conclude them one by one.

Vietnam Provisional Government Joins French Federation, Ho Chi Minh Denounces It as Puppet Government [United Press, Hanoi, 5th] The French-sponsored Vietnam Provisional Central Government was announced on Saturday near Haiphong on a French warship. French High Commissioner Bollaert, Annam Sun King Bao Dai, and Provisional Government Prime Minister Nguyen Van Xuan signed a treaty recognizing its accession to the French Federation. Bao Dai read out the proclamation of the establishment of the Provisional Government. His yellow embroidered red dragon imperial flag flew alongside the French tricolor flag and the new national flag of the Provisional Government (yellow with red stripes). Bao Dai's own status is still unclear. Although referred to as His Majesty, he is not included in the new government. The Vietnamese government led by Ho Chi Minh calls this new regime a puppet government.

New Government List [Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] The Vietnam Provisional Central Government has been formed and sworn in at the Li Li Hall at 5 PM this afternoon. The list of the new government is as follows: Chairman and Minister of National Defense Nguyen Van Xuan, Vice Chairman, Governor of Cochinchina Tran Van Khac, Governor of Tonkin Nghiem Xuan Thien, Governor of Annam Phan Nguyen Giao, Minister of Propaganda Phan Huy Dan, Minister of Finance Nguyen Trung Vinh, Minister of Public Health Dang Huu Tri, Minister of Youth and Sports Nguyen Khoa Toan, Deputy Minister of Youth and Sports Yen Xuan Trach, Minister of Interior Nguyen Khac Tri, Deputy Minister of National Defense Tran Quang Vinh, Minister of Justice Nguyen Khac Ve, Minister of Agriculture Tran Thien Hong, Minister of Public Works Nguyen Van Tu, Chief Secretary Dinh Xuan Quang.

Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Restore Old System of Tong Organizations, Our Government Protests to France, Declares All Consequences Should Be Borne by France [Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] The French Commissioner for Tonkin, Dicaux, officially announced this afternoon that the system of Overseas Chinese Tong Offices will be restored from today onwards, and has also announced the list of persons in charge of Overseas Chinese Tong Offices in various places. This move is similar in nature to the dissolution of various Chinese General Associations in the Saigon-Cholon area by the French authorities in Cochinchina, and the accusation of the responsible persons of various Chinese General Associations of the crime of organizing illegal groups. The question of the organizational method of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam is one of the Sino-French diplomatic cases, which is still under negotiation. Before the result of the negotiation was reached, the French side took unilateral action, apparently trying to create a fait accompli and restore the old system before the war. Our government, considering that the French side disregarded its repeated promises and took unilateral action, submitted a written protest today, and declared that all consequences should be borne by the French side.

British Commissioner for Southeast Asia Says He Will Prevent Communist Activities [United Press, Singapore, 6th] British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald said in a broadcast tonight that there is an indication that international communist leaders have decided to launch a political offensive in Asia after being frustrated in Europe. Communist agitators are desperately trying to implement the rule of the sword in the plantations, mines, and factories of the Malayan region. Such movements must be suppressed. Labor unrest occurred in Malayan rubber plantations, factories and tin mines last month.

Fourth Anniversary of the Normandy Landing, Britain and France Hold Grand Commemorations, Encouraging Each Other to Continue to Maintain Unity [Reuters, Paris, 6th] Today, with international tensions unabated, the French people commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Normandy landings, a turning point in World War II, with particular emotion. French President Auriol and British and American ambassadors went to the Normandy coast to pay tribute, laying wreaths at the tombs of British, American, and Canadian soldiers. The President also went to the city of Caen in northern France, which was the site of the heaviest sacrifices in the landing battle by British and Canadian troops. A special memorial mass was held at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris was filled with wreaths to commemorate this earth-shattering battle four years ago.

Truman Arrives in Omaha, Speaks on Importance of Agriculture [United Press, Nebraska, Omaha, 5th] President Truman, touring the western states, spoke in this agricultural area today, advocating support for agriculture and ensuring the future welfare of rural America, roughly the same as the bill he presented to Congress on May 14th.

[Associated Press, Omaha, 5th] President Truman, speaking at the 35th Division reunion today, said that the United States is determined to do its best to make the United Nations succeed. He said that after World War II, the United States embarked on a new path, without repeating the mistakes of the aftermath of World War I, when shortsighted people in the Senate prevented us from joining the League of Nations, and the United States suffered from it. Therefore, we should be vigilant now and not let the tragedy after World War I repeat itself.

[Central News Agency, Omaha, Nebraska, 5th] Truman, after arriving in this traditionally isolationist Midwest, his "non-political" transcontinental journey has turned into a very solemn political activity. He himself is more confident that he can be re-elected in the November election. Every time he goes to one of these five states, he asks the people to help him be re-elected. Truman's trip has been warmly welcomed, and the work of directly promoting himself to the Americans seems to be successful. Judging from the response received in the initial stages of his trip, his prestige has obviously increased, but it remains to be seen what kind of achievements he can achieve.

Maintaining Intermediate Forces, French Premier Decides to Continue in Office [Central News Agency, Paris, 5th, Associated Press] It is reported that French Prime Minister Schuman has decided to maintain his "Third Force" government at all costs, at least until October of this year, to avoid a conflict between the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction.

[Reuters, London, 6th] Today is the fourth anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, and churches throughout Britain held religious ceremonies to commemorate the brave warriors who sacrificed themselves four years ago. The memorial to the 255,000 Allied soldiers who died in the battle, built at the Portsmouth naval base, was also commemorated today by the British Empire Chief of Staff.

Eliminating Selfishness, Seeking International Understanding, Auriol Calls on the Powers [Reuters, Paris, 6th] French President Auriol gave a speech at the Anbeson fortress in Normandy yesterday, calling on the victorious Allied nations of World War II to maintain unity and fulfill their national missions. After mentioning the great achievements of the Allied forces and the French resistance fighters, Auriol said, "We must restore the principles of the Allied nations unanimously held during the five years of resistance, and the principles of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter. These principles require all countries to fulfill their missions and are the best guarantee against suspicion, fear, and shrinking back. We know that the responsibility for the current situation lies in the selfish psychology of the countries, which has misunderstood the revolution of the modern world and the distinction between its individual interests and true independence. For this reason, France is prepared to limit part of its sovereignty on the basis of reciprocity to ensure international security, such as the establishment of an international security force and international control of weapons produced in factories and laboratories. We believe that if we can recognize the axioms of the Internet order and the needs of prosperity, and have the will to succeed, any disputes of the past can be easily resolved. France is concerned about its own obligations for the safety of all countries in the world. France has the right to obtain its legitimate compensation, and has the right to declare the danger of any international policy that does not show its warnings and experiences. France is most sensitive to these international policies. France has the right to demand that the enemy of yesterday not become the enemy of the victorious country, and has the right to demand that the victorious countries agree and fulfill their obligations to each other.

Arab-Israeli Stalemate, Bernadotte Has Not Met with Arab-Israeli Leaders, Israeli Side Unwilling to Concede on Immigration Issue [Reuters, London, 6th] United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte left Rhodes this morning for Haifa to meet again with Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok. After the meeting between Bernadotte and Shertok, he will fly to Amman, the capital of Jordan, to meet with Arab League leaders, and then fly back to Cairo to study the results of today's negotiations and decide on the final course of action.

At the same time, British Commander-in-Chief of Palestine General Macmillan also left Haifa today for the Suez Canal area to meet with senior British officials. It is expected that the meeting will decide on the plan for the implementation of the ceasefire and make recommendations to Bernadotte. In the military aspect, the war continues on all fronts, but the positions of both sides have not changed significantly.

[Reuters, London, 5th] United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte met with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi for 90 minutes in Cairo on the 5th to seek a ceasefire formula acceptable to both Jews and Arabs. In addition, Bernadotte also met with United Nations Commissioner for Jerusalem Evans and Peng Qu of the United Nations Palestine Committee Secretariat. Bernadotte seemed very optimistic when he arrived in Beirut, saying that both the Jewish and Arab sides were hoping to accept his ceasefire terms. It is understood that the current stumbling block is still the immigration issue. The Security Council has entrusted Bernadotte with full power to decide on this matter. The Arab side insisted that immigration to Palestine must be stopped first before it would accept the ceasefire plan, while the Jewish side disagreed. The Security Council originally scheduled a meeting yesterday to discuss whether Jewish men of military age should be allowed to enter Palestine during the ceasefire period, but it was suddenly canceled and Bernadotte was authorized to decide. If Bernadotte can reconcile the opinions of the Jews and Arabs on the immigration issue without the Security Council continuing the debate, then Bernadotte can be regarded as a suitable candidate to complete the final solution to Palestine.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 5th] An Israeli spokesman said on the 5th that unless the Arabs make concessions on the immigration dispute that is delaying the start of the truce, the chances of a Palestinian truce will suffer a "serious blow." He firmly adhered to the provision of the United Nations Security Council ceasefire plan, which specifically stipulates that men of military age may immigrate to Palestine during the ceasefire period, as long as they are not trained or mobilized. Currently, the Jewish side seems to have no hope of accepting a compromise on this point, and may only agree to immigrate men of military age at a slower pace.

Work of the Small Assembly Emphasizes Mediation of Disputes, Progress Has Been Made in Promoting International Cooperation [Central News Agency, Lake Success, 6th] US representative to the United Nations Small Assembly Jessup said today that the Small Assembly has made practical progress in the work of promoting the general principles of international cooperation and has improved the method of peaceful settlement of disputes. The 15-nation small group committee of the Small Assembly is currently studying how to implement the principles of international political cooperation stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Jessup made a statement on the work of the committee, especially mentioning the proposal jointly put forward by China and the United States. According to this proposal, a group of qualified people should be proposed, and member states or the United Nations should select some of them to participate in the investigation or reconciliation committee. Jessup also said that the Small Assembly is currently engaged in another work, which is to study how to peacefully resolve disputes through negotiation, mediation, reconciliation, arbitration, and legal solutions. The study of the above issues by the Small Assembly originated from the suggestion made by our representative Xu Shuxi in January of this year.

American People More Restless and Unstable in the Past Seven Years, Seventy Million People Move Frequently [United Press, New York, 5th] According to figures released by the US Bureau of Statistics, the American people have been more restless and unstable in the past seven years than at any time before. According to government statistics, 70 million people (almost half of the US population) moved to new homes from 1940 to 1947, of which 25 million moved from one country to another or from one state to another. Most of the movement was towards the west, with the western states increasing their population by 2 million people, and about 1.5 million people moving to the south. The main reason for the movement is employment opportunities. The average age of the people who move is 23 to 35 years old. Among young people aged 38 to 24, there are more women leaving home than men, and the educational level of those who move is higher than those who do not.

[France Press Agency, London, 6th] According to the London "People's Daily" today, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made a suggestion to the United States to divide the world into two spheres of influence. It is heard that the negotiations are currently being conducted by US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik.

It is rumored that the Soviet Union proposed to the United States to divide the world into two major spheres of influence, Negotiations are being conducted in Washington and Moscow [Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] The French Foreign Ministry today explained the recent signs of international politics as a compromise of East-West tensions. Among the various signs, two major facts are the most important: (1) The peaceful proposal of the Greek rebel leader; (2) The United States reduces its aid to Europe. It is believed here that the actions of the Greek rebels may have been instructed by the Kremlin. The United States' reduction of aid to the Marshall Plan seems to be a compromise action by Washington. In addition, the slight relaxation of East-West tensions can be proved by the following facts: (1) The Soviet Union abandoned part of Finland's reparations; (2) Neither Yugoslavia nor the Soviet Union denied the rumors of the dissolution of the International Intelligence Bureau.

Indonesian Membership Application Case, Asian Economic Committee Extends Discussion, Will Be Submitted Again Next Wednesday [United Press, Ootacamund, India, 5th] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East today extended the discussion of the Indonesian Republic's application for membership for the second time, and will submit it again next Wednesday. The Philippines proposed to postpone the discussion to the next meeting, which was passed with a vote of two to four after India proposed an amendment, which was seconded by the Soviet Union.

General Commander Meng Presided over the Unveiling. During his speech, he earnestly called on all victorious Allied nations to continue to maintain unity. He said, "We have won the victory in the war. Will we lose the peace?" Recalling the course of the battle

Science, Radio Waves, and the Universe by Gang Ren

The progress of science has not only greatly changed human life but has also brought seemingly mysterious theories into practice, producing astonishing facts. Astronomy and physics are no exception. Conversely, much of our knowledge about the world, such as the atomic fission found in stars, being realized by humans on Earth, is the most obvious proof.

Therefore, people feel that it is worthwhile to spend human and material resources to explore the universe and reform old concepts. Tools and methods are, of course, the prerequisites for all research.

Since humans began thousands of years of cosmic exploration, they have relied on their naturally endowed eyes. This is clearly unreliable. Until Galileo introduced the telescope to us, it only moved the round celestial bodies, stars, and moons closer in a mirror. Observation was still with the naked eye, inevitably resulting in blurred and unrecognizable sensations.

It was not until the last century that scientists used spectroscopes to analyze the light emitted by celestial bodies into a spectrum. Although this spectrum provided them with much assistance, it was still insufficient for a thorough understanding of the composition of celestial bodies.

Recently, due to the astonishing progress in wireless battery research, wireless radio receivers have been expanded and applied to astronomy, serving as the latest tool among many less reliable instruments.

In 1929, American physicist U. J. Jansky heard a "hissing" noise from a shortwave radio receiver and proposed studying these sounds, which he believed came from other planets.

Many scientists continued to study this problem and reached the initial conclusion that the source of these sounds was the stars of the Milky Way.

At this time, Sir Edward Appleton and J. S. Hey in the United States also discovered that many powerful disturbances came from sunspots. Sunspots are the most powerful shortwave radio stations, with the equivalent of one million kilowatts of power.

At the recent British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting, Sir Edward Appleton presented his 1946 report, pointing out the detailed relationship between the changes in sunspots and all radio waves on Earth.

Now, many scientists believe that the "cosmic static" discovered by Jansky may be coming from "star spots."

However, how to explain all these cosmic "static" sounds, our radio wave research is still an imperfect science, lacking experiments and records. But applying radio waves to cosmic research will undoubtedly allow people to understand more things.

It is generally believed that cosmic rays and cosmic "static" are not related, but a few scientists believe they come from the same source. Many Soviet and American scientists are actively studying this.

Obviously, our naked eyes can only see a very small part of the universe, and our eyeballs cannot analyze emitted light into a spectrum. Spectroscopes are used here to supplement this, allowing us to study the various substances contained in celestial bodies. Their eyeballs cannot accept cosmic "static" at all. However, with radio receivers, which convert electromagnetic energy into sounds that resonate in our eardrums and send them into our ears, humanity has tightened its grip on wisdom and tools.

Therefore, further research into the universe requires relying on these tools and methods. The United States and Britain are making great efforts in radio detection of the universe. Radar research and application are a beautiful interlude because they know that these disturbances to the quiet spectrum contain many truths that will not only serve as corroboration for existing theories but also generate new discoveries.

If metallurgists can find the most beautiful materials from the study of Earth's substances, bringing happiness to mankind, and a Russian scientist named Popov (Baport) before Marconi proposed "wireless communication," which is practically connected to people's information and emotions, why is literary cosmic research impossible?

Therefore, the harsh static first heard by Sir Jansky and the use of radio waves as a tool are not only extremely important in astronomy.

### The Largest Telescope

by Li Zhonghuan

The world's largest astronomical telescope is a 200-inch reflector telescope installed on Mount Palomar in San Diego County, Southern California, USA. This 200-inch telescope can collect four times more starlight than the previous 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson and has more than twice the distance. It can see cosmic space beyond 100,000 light-years (approximately 5.865.696.000.000 miles). It is mounted on a base 137 feet in diameter and weighs 500 pounds. Engineers have tried their best to make it sophisticated and flexible, so a motor the size of a fist can make it turn freely.

As early as eighteen years ago, astronomer E. P. Hubble used a 100-inch telescope to measure gradually dimming nebulae and came to an unprecedented conclusion in the scientific community. He believed that the entire universe is expanding.

Astronomy has a speedometer to measure the movement of planets. Starlight is aligned with the telescope and then analyzed into a spectrum by a prism. When this spectrum is redder than normal, it indicates that the planet is farther away from Earth. This phenomenon is called "redshift." When Hubble discovered the phenomenon of redshift in light, the receding speed increased. His conclusion was: The receding speed of nebulae is proportional to their distance.

According to Hubble's discovery, nebulae beyond 250 million light-years are escaping at an astonishing speed of one-eighth faster than the speed of light. This theory aroused opposition from many scientists because Einstein's theory of relativity (the highest law of physics) states that nothing in the universe can move faster than the speed of light. The 100-inch telescope allowed Hubble to discover that the universe is expanding, but it also raised many unanswered questions. This requires a 200-inch telescope to solve.

In 1928, the Rockefeller Foundation agreed to manufacture this telescope for him, but no manufacturer could customize a 500-ton glass brick. In 1936, the glass brick for the lens was finally transported to the Palomar Optical Factory at the California Institute of Technology for polishing. Before it was completed, the Pacific War broke out. Hubble had to temporarily suspend his work to participate in wartime work.

After the war, he returned to the optical factory. Under his supervision, this extremely delicate polishing work proceeded step by step. This edge had to be parabolic. The accuracy had to reach one two-millionth of an inch. Visitors were not allowed to wear boots inside because a grain of sand could ruin months of polishing work. The mirror was finally completed in August 1946.

Astronomers work on the mountain at night and can get enough sleep in light-avoiding bedrooms during the day.

(For theories about redshift and the expanding universe, please refer to "Old Zhu's Dream Tour of the Physics World" translated by Wang Pu of the China Scientific Book Instrument Company, which is clearer than other books).

### Uses of Television

by Qu Youding

Television (also known as wireless facsimile) is a major advancement in the electrical field in modern times. The benefits it provides to mankind are even greater than those of wireless radio. This method of transmitting distant object images was invented by the Englishman John L. Baird many years ago. Now, it is thriving and developing rapidly.

In addition to being used for family entertainment, television also has many normal and important uses, which are briefly described below.

Normally, divers can only dive to a depth of about two hundred feet, but with the use of television, our vision can be extended to a greater depth without any danger. This method involves placing a television display inside a thick metal-walled measuring cylinder, which is then lowered into the water from an observation ship and sunk to the depths of the ocean. The surveyors can then sit comfortably on the deck and complete their observation tasks in a few hours if they are skilled. For the television display, only a thicker cylinder wall is needed to resist the pressure at the bottom of the water. It does not need air supply, nor is it afraid of the near-zero temperature at a depth of six hundred feet. This underwater television can assist in marine rescue and underwater salvage operations and can indicate the appropriate location for drilling underwater oil wells. The depth to which it can sink is only related to the amount of pressure the cylinder wall can withstand.

The melting situation in glass furnaces and ore furnaces has always been unknown because their heat is too high. When measuring their high temperature, an optical pyrometer must be used to measure at a considerable distance. Observers must wear specially made black protective goggles, and only a moment is possible to observe. If you get too close, you will become blind and your skin will burn. However, if a television display is installed in the appropriate place inside the furnace, the melting situation can be reflected in the eyes of the factory's office engineers. The engineer can observe from start to finish, just like traveling inside the furnace. The radiant gold or glass inside the furnace provides sufficient light for the display. The display itself can be cooled with a special coolant liquid to prevent it from being destroyed by the fire. In the future, if it develops to a considerable extent, it may be possible to install television devices in all parts of the factory to facilitate centralized management and control, protect life safety, and promote the quality of production and increase output.

The continued development of television will completely change the education system. When necessary, the blackboard in the lecture hall will be changed to a television screen, especially in medical schools.

In terms of entertainment, it has gradually become widespread in the United States. The total number of television equipment across the country is often more than 100,000, and there are already enough relay broadcasting stations. However, its broadcast range currently only covers a circular area with a radius of 40 to 60 miles. A standard television broadcasting station usually has several hours of broadcasting time per day. The programs are mostly ball games on the sports field, wrestling, tickets, and theater scenes.

The above refers to black and white television. Recently, there has been an invention of full-color television. A year ago, the American Columbia Broadcasting Company made this claim, saying that using ultra-high-rate waves similar to radar waves can obtain brighter and clearer full-color television than black and white. Subsequent continued development will eventually succeed. This type of color transmission is entirely an electronic transmission, and the rotating parts in the equipment have been replaced by photocells and reflectors. There is a transmitting cathode ray tube at the transmitting end. The rays emitted by this tube pass through prisms and color coatings to the photocells and reflectors, and then emit a beam of light, which is divided into red, green, and blue color images and emitted. On the receiver side, there are three color separation mirrors, which simultaneously receive various color images and display them through the action of fluorescent and reflective screens.

The frequency of color television waves is higher than that required for black and white. Other parameters such as the emission rate, the number of prisms, and the picture repetition rate (30 times per second) are similar to those used previously. Therefore, only a frequency converter is needed to convert a black and white television receiver into a color one.

### Summer Cooling Methods

by Liu Yi

Every summer, heat waves come, which greatly reduces our work efficiency. Although scientists have invented various cooling methods and equipment, such as electric fans and air conditioners, which are well known, these equipment are mostly limited to large restaurants, movie theaters, banks, large companies, and wealthy families. Most people are not blessed to enjoy them. In the hot summer, the scorching sun is fearful. Living in a small room is like being in a cage, which is indeed annoying.

Recently, the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois in the United States has established a residential cooling research laboratory, which is dedicated to researching how ordinary middle and lower-class people can cool their houses. The laboratory has special hot air pipe and air conditioning pipe equipment to test how to increase the temperature in winter and how to reduce the temperature in summer. The object of research is the ordinary houses where most people live. According to the experimental research, the effective and easy-to-implement method is to open the windows of the house as much as possible from 6 pm to 6 am the next day. Conversely, close the windows more during the day. In other words, it is advisable to let cold air flow in at night and retain it for daytime use. Open the doors and windows on the top floor at night. This forms a natural air circulation path, which can gradually flow the hot air in the lower floors of the room during the day to the outside. Close it again during the day to prevent the cold air in the room from flowing out. For those who want to be more comfortable, use curtains to cover the three sides of the doors and windows that are exposed to the sun. In this way, the intrusion of heat waves can be reduced. According to experimental results, the difference in coolness and heat between houses with curtains and without curtains can reach 20% to 30%, which means that the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors is 20% to 30%. This seems like a cliché and there is no great truth, but if you follow it, you will get the practical benefits of cooling. Moreover, this method is simple, easy to implement, and costs nothing.

### Scientific News: Acid-Resistant Glass

by Liu Suisheng

Hydrofluoric acid can corrode glass, which is well known to those who study chemistry. Therefore, rubber bottles or wax bottles are usually used to store hydrofluoric acid. But today, hydrofluoric acid can be stored in glass bottles. Not only does it not change at the time, but even after three weeks, there is no sign of corrosion. What is the reason?

Hydrofluoric acid can chemically react with the main component of ordinary glass, sand, causing corrosion. The main component of the newly invented "anti-acid glass" is mostly phosphorus pentoxide.

This new type of glass was invented by the American Optical Company when studying the atomic bomb and handling another glass-corroding substance, uranium hexafluoride.

(Notes) (1) Hydrofluoric acid is made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to fluorite (calcium fluoride):

CaF2+H2SO4—CaSO4+H2F2 (Hydrofluoric Acid).

(2) The principle of hydrofluoric acid corroding ordinary glass:

3H2F2+Na2SiO3 (Glass)—2NaF+SiF4+3H2O.

Sodium fluoride, NaF, is soluble in water; silicon fluoride, SiF4, is a gas that escapes.

(3) Phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) can be produced by burning.

(4) Ordinary glass is made of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sand (SiO2).

### Insect Growth Hormones

by Hao Tianhe

Although people have always been skeptical about the existence and function of hormones in insects, it has now been generally recognized by insect scientists such as Elggt Warth and Weed. A new science called Insect Endocrinology has also been established. Currently, most researchers focus on the following three aspects: (1) color hormones, (2) the function of base control hormones, and (3) growth hormones. This article only provides an overview of the third item.

In the late embryonic stage of insects, there is also a set of developmental procedures. Insects go through larvae and emerge as adults. This phenomenon is called metamorphosis. Some insects directly change from larvae to adults, and some insects must go through a pupal stage between larvae and adults. Although the metamorphosis of the former is gradual, the change in shape during the last molt is very different from the previous molts. The latter type of change is very significant at each stage. These two types of changes are consistent in physiology and steps, but they differ only in time and degree.

The growth hormones in insects can be divided into two types: (1) molting hormone; (2) metamorphic hormone.

(1) Molting hormone—Insect molting has a certain period, so the age is also mostly fixed. Due to the secretion of this hormone, the insect larvae can molt. For example, in the development period of some blood-sucking assassin bugs (scientific name Rho ntus), the first four instars take 12 to 15 days, while the last instar takes 28 days. If the head is cut off after it is full of food in the first few days of each instar, this can effectively prevent it from molting. Sometimes this headless assassin bug can live for more than a year. Hormone secretion has a certain time limit, called the critical period. The critical period for this blood-sucking assassin bug is 4 days after being full for the first four instars, and 7 days after being full for the last instar. If the head is cut off after the critical period, molting cannot be prevented because the hormone is transmitted in the insect's body through blood circulation. After the critical period, the hormone has been brought to the body (various parts). Try to connect two headless assassin bugs with a capillary tube at their necks, and then seal them with glue. In this way, an insect that has produced molting hormone can pour its hormone into the body of another insect that has not produced molting hormone through the blood. As a result, this insect can also molt. The properties and functions of the molting hormones produced in each instar are the same. Therefore, the blood of a fourth-instar larva can make a first-instar larva and a fifth-instar larva molt. It can even make a blood-sucking assassin bug that has molted once molt again. What is even stranger is that: molting hormone is not restricted by species. Insects with close blood relations can interact with each other. Therefore, a blood-sucking assassin bug can make another genus of assassin bug (Triatoma) molt. Even the bed bug (Cimex), which belongs to a different family, can make it molt. It is very clear that there is no species difference in molting hormone.

Another type of molting hormone is found in lepidopteran insects. The molting of some moths (scientific name Lymantria) from larvae to pupae depends on the action of this hormone. The critical period for this moth to produce this hormone is between 7 and 10 days of the last instar larva. During this period, if the last instar larva of this moth is cut with a knife or tied into two halves with thin silk, the front half will soon pupate, and the back half will not change even if it can live for a few weeks. If it is divided into two halves in the same way after 10 days, both the front and back halves can pupate soon. The critical period for silkworms (Bombyx mori) to pupate is before they stop eating. Similarly, people have used flies (Callipilora) for experiments. When this fly is about to pupate, tie the last instar larva into two sections with thin silk or hair. If it is within 12 hours, both the front and back sections can pupate. If it is before 12 hours, only the front half can pupate. Its critical period is 12 hours before pupation. To pupate the back half of this fly, you only need to inject the blood from the front half into the back half. The most interesting thing is that not only can injecting the blood of this fly into the body of its larvae cause the larvae to pupate early, but if the blood of wax moth (Galleria) larvae or pupae is drawn and injected into the larvae of this fly, it can also make the larvae pupate.

The secretions of these two molting hormones may come from the following four places: the first place to secrete hormones may be yellow cells. Between the epidermis and basement membrane of insects, there are some yellow, multi-lobed cells scattered. They were first discovered by Fabre, who named them yellow cells. In fact, they are colorless in the cortex of most insects. The growth of these cells varies with the type of insect. In some insects, such as in the larvae of one genus of insect (Thrixion), the yellow cells increase with age. The second instar is three times the size of the first instar, and the third instar is about twice the size of the second instar. In the larvae of other insects, such as silkworms, these cells increase periodically. Yellow cells can secrete molting hormone, which can be proved in silkworms. When silkworms molt each time, the cells in the skin are particularly enlarged and also show special activity. Conversely, if these cells do not change, the silkworms will not molt. The second possible place to secrete molting hormone is probably Verson's Gland. This gland also grows in the epidermal layer, under the old cornea, with thin tubes leading out to facilitate the excretion of secretions. The third place is the corpora allata. They are a pair of tiny white glands located between the small brain and mandibles of the larvae. Wigglesworth used the above-mentioned blood-sucking assassin bugs as research material and found that the cells of this gland are particularly enlarged during the critical period. The last possible place to secrete is the insect's brain. If the brain of the larva is cut off, it cannot pupate.

(2) Metamorphic hormone—Due to the existence of this hormone, it can prevent insect larvae or pupae from emerging into adults. This is the opposite of the function of the previously mentioned molting hormone. We inject the blood of fourth-instar larvae of blood-sucking assassin bugs into the bodies of last-instar larvae, which can prevent them from emerging. During the critical period of each instar larva, if their heads are cut off, most of them can emerge. This proves that each instar larva is completely prevented by metamorphic hormone, otherwise they would become adults. This metamorphic hormone also has no species difference. The organ that secretes the hormone is also the corpora allata. Try to cut off the corpora allata of the third-instar or fourth-instar larvae of blood-sucking assassin bugs and transplant them into the bodies of last-instar larvae, and it will produce a huge larva that can never emerge into an adult.

### Random Thoughts: The Masses and Discipline

by Jing Wen

After watching the two films "Melody of Youth" and "The Great Review," I was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the mass scenes. However, I have a feeling that these neatly marching troops and unified forms, although beautiful, are they really expressing the meaning of united will? Do these seemingly grand scenes represent the union of individual free wills?

The reason why I have such doubts is that in Germany when the Nazis were in power, the mass scenes displayed by the Brownshirts also had the same grand and orderly style. Even under Mussolini, the Fascist "goose step" also had its special formal beauty. These were all propagated at the time as expressions of mass power, the Great Wall formed by united will. But now they have all collapsed.

The above remarks are not biased. I just think that disciplined unity is ultimately not as powerful as the unity of free will. The Spartans of ancient times were the most disciplined people. Although there were nobles, commoners, and slaves in Spartan society, the pure Spartans who were in the position of nobles, under strict disciplinary training, lived a life of hardship that far surpassed the commoners and slaves under them. The private lives of the leaders of the so-called "revolutionary regimes" of the extreme left or extreme right were often extremely ascetic and self-motivated and emphasized "iron discipline" before they succeeded. After taking power, this "iron discipline" was used as a tool to control subordinates. Therefore, all totalitarian countries, in their heyday, often appear as united as iron barrels on the outside. The power of the masses is even expressed as solid as the Great Wall. The "grand" scenes that Hitler manipulated at the Munich Party Congress and the successive Berlin mass rallies deceived the eyes and ears of countless people at the time.

Compared with the Spartans, Athenian society at that time also had nobles and slaves, but one was like a barracks, and the other was like a garden. The Spartans, apart from the heroic tragedy of the Battle of Thermopylae, seem to have left nothing in history. On the other hand, Athens is not only the cradle of Greek culture but also the birthplace of Western European philosophy and literary and artistic thought, making a great contribution to human civilization.

Having said that, I have no intention of slighting "iron discipline" and the power of the masses. Because humans are necessarily social animals and cannot live apart from the group. And in a group society, a certain discipline is necessary. The development of human social civilization to have written or unwritten laws shows that humans themselves have a demand for discipline.

In individual units, discipline is necessary. However, in addition to maintaining order, the most important role of discipline is to awaken the members of a group or society to the self-awareness of morality, which is generally called a sense of responsibility. Such discipline must be built on the basis of the free will of each individual. It must make people understand that the discipline they obey is not an external pressure, but a moral contract they have made with society. Only such discipline can generate true unity.

People who distort liberalism often think that freedom is licentiousness, lack of discipline, and inability to unite. But the lessons of history are almost completely the opposite. Hitler, Mussolini, and a group of Japanese militarists in the past held this view. The discipline they valued was "ten-cheng" style discipline, and the mass power they valued was the orderly form of the Brownshirts or Blackshirts. The countries of the free world were, in their eyes, a disorganized crowd that was vulnerable to attack. This increased their confidence in this regard because of the repeated defeats of liberal countries such as Britain and France at the beginning of the war. But they did not expect that the people of liberal countries would also have mass power and the discipline of a wartime country, and they exerted an effect that they did not expect.

The power of the masses is great, and discipline also has a restraining effect. However, if one relies solely on the restraint of discipline to manipulate the power of the masses while neglecting the development of individual free will, sooner or later one will inevitably repeat the mistakes of people like Hitler and Mussolini, resulting in the tragic outcome of the tree falling and the monkeys scattering.

Finally, I must state that this article is only my personal feeling about general phenomena and has nothing to do with the two films mentioned. It is only used as an introduction.

### Sequel to "Flowers of Shanghai": The Author, the Old Man of Yan Valley

by Qian Dacheng

The author of "Sequel to Flowers of Shanghai," the Old Man of Hua Valley, surnamed Zhang, styled Yinnan, and named, also known as Mang Gong, Layman of Mang's Nest, and in his later years, he lived in Yan Garden, so he also called himself the Old Man of Yan Valley. His original name was Cheng, a native of Changshu. He was a Jinshi in the Qing Guangxu Jia Chen period, an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a recording imperial censor, and a consul in Kobe, Japan and Incheon, Korea. During the palace examination, the reading ministers presented ten volumes, and the old man ranked first. Because his countermeasures advocated constitutionalism, he disobeyed the will of Empress Dowager Cixi and was suppressed to the first place in the third class. He lost the first prize, which was a pity for those who heard about it. During the turmoil, his cousin, Mr. Nan Tie, obtained his palace examination paper at a cold stall, and I once saw it.

During the Qing Dynasty, Grand Historian Shen Beishan impeached the three villains (Gang Yi, Rong Lu, and Li Lianying), and his upright voice shook the world. The draft was actually written by the old man. I will write another article about this.

During the Ding Chou Rebellion, the old man fled to Guilin and broke a foot on the way. When he arrived in Shanghai, he lived with Master Shen Peiwei. For several years, he could not go downstairs. In his later years, he became more and more impoverished. His only son died early, and he had only one daughter, who married Shao. His grandson, Yanqing, was living with his daughter at that time. He sold the remaining calligraphy and paintings to make a living. The novel "Sequel to Flowers of Shanghai," which he wrote, was first introduced and published in the Beiping Zhonghe Monthly and received a small amount of royalties. Later, a certain bookstore published it as a separate book, but he did not receive a penny. It is said that the sales were not bad, and the old man's daughter did not want to pursue the matter, but she was fortunate that her father's writings could be passed down immortal. The old man also translated the Yuan Secret History, which was published in the Guoxue Lunheng. He also had manuscripts and notes, which were all stored in the Ting family.

The year before last, I bought the old man's hand-corrected "Complete Works of Shangu" at the Cungu Bookstore in Suzhou. He carefully examined it with vermilion ink, and no stroke was left uncorrected. Master Yang Wuyang and Master Mengshao each wrote a postscript, saying that they had seen the old man's hand-annotated "Cheng Weishi Lun," "Han Changli," "Wang Linchuan," and "Mei Wanling" collections in the past. They were scattered during the turmoil, and I don't know where they were transferred. People know that the old man's poetry admired Yuxi, but in fact, he used a lot of effort on Shangu. Shangu and Jinggong both came from Yuxi, and the old man certainly got his secret.

This spring, I went to the old man's former residence, Ying Garden. After the war, it was desolate and overgrown with weeds, and I could not overcome the feeling of the past and the present. The old man once had a garden poem: "Sitting and lying in a barren garden for twenty springs, white pine and blue stone are free from dust. The old man tries his best to maintain it, leaving it for others to love and protect in the future." The old man was deeply versed in internal Buddhist scriptures and knew that all laws are empty, and when the cause is exhausted, it will perish. However, the white-haired students who come here cannot help but feel sad.

### Little Raindrops

by Shi Jimei

Good people are lonely, bad people are isolated, and people who are neither good nor bad are in pain.

If you sow the seeds of balsam, how can a peony bloom in the flower club?

If you build a beautiful and dazzling fairy palace in the sky, it is better to pile up a small mound on the mud construction site.

A mirror that is too clear may make you feel disgusted because you see your own freckles and pimples, but it faithfully reminds you - allowing you to know yourself.

The sparrow's wings are hard, and it still has to leave its old nest. Can people stay in their hometowns for a lifetime?

Don't sigh that people have forgotten you. Maybe you abandoned them?

On the smooth as a mirror floor, in the melodious music, the waltz begins. Maybe you will complain that the pair of cloth shoes on your feet cannot dance?

But, on the rugged mountain road, your cloth shoes are useful, and the beautiful high heels are placed aside.

### The Disgrace of the Twentieth Century

by Li Chu

Although the twentieth century is an era of freedom and equality, the problem of racial discrimination still exists in the United States today.

In the southern United States, the black and white divide is very strict. Black people cannot enter white schools; black people have a "special carriage" on trains; theaters, churches, and other public places have separate entrances and seats for blacks and whites. If a black person mistakenly enters the white entrance, it is "deserved," but if a white person mistakenly enters the black entrance, there are also "thousands of prohibitions." Not long ago, Senator Taylor, a campaign aide to Wallace, was charged with disturbing public order by the security authorities for insisting on entering through the black entrance at a black gathering in Birmingham. As a result, the court sentenced him to a fine of fifty dollars and 180 days in detention, but the detention portion was suspended.

What is even more painful is that black people are also subject to interference when they buy property in white areas. A black builder named Shelley in St. Louis bought a house in a white area. As soon as he moved in, he was sued by the surrounding "white neighbors." As a result of the lawsuit, Shelley was able to preserve his property, but he had exhausted his energy. It can be seen that what is not a problem for white people—such as buying property—has become a "big problem" for black people.

Are black people so annoying? White people always say they are stupid, unclean, and morally depraved. Even if uncleanness and moral depravity are facts, they may be caused by economic and social factors; stupidity is not necessarily the case. In recent years, the achievements of black people in literature, music, engineering, and other fields have proved that they are not stupid. There is a genius school in New York that admits highly intelligent genius children, and there are also black people among them.

These kinds of prejudices are undoubtedly obstacles to civilized progress. But looking to the future, there is still no hope of improvement. Recently, Dr. Malan of the National Party won the general election in South Africa. One of the policies he advocates is to more thoroughly implement the segregation of whites and colored people. This is a reverse current of the times and a shame for "civilized people."

### The Golden World of the United States of America

The golden world of the United States of America has its natural value and endowment, and its artificial historical efforts. The resources of that land are particularly rich, and industry and science are second to none in the world. Therefore, it owns 90% of the global gold rate and is strong. Its luxury of all enjoyments is indeed something that is done without doing it, and it cannot be imitated by force. Moreover, Western fables and novels already have stories satirizing gold worship, briefly saying that one person is busy with gold all day long, and the residence is nothing but gold. Gradually, the five senses and limbs also turn into gold, and then become a useless person who cannot speak or move. This is indeed a refreshing elixir for those who are trapped in material things. Moreover, China is poor and weak, and after a great disaster, it only sees the wealth of neighboring countries, following step by step, which is inevitably too naive. It is said that the confiscated traitorous property in Shanghai has countless gemstones and gold, which shows that people are blinded and only know that more money is better, and they do not know how to enjoy it or how to control it. Just like the villain in the play "Picking Up Gold" and Zhang Wang in the play "Greedy Joy," they hold a large amount of silver but don't know what to do with it. It is a full description of the parvenu! Old bureaucrats such as Sheng Xuanhuai were not only profit-oriented and made countless fortunes, but they used them for self-enjoyment, for charity, for education and culture, and for contributing to the Empress Dowager, all in an orderly manner. This is called "spending what you have seen." This matter also has a distinction between "experts" and "old hands," and the difference between new and old rich people lies in this.

### The Beginning and End of the New Stele of Hanshan Temple

by Zheng Yimei

The painter Wu Hufan is recovering from illness and is said to have been discharged from the hospital. Yesterday, I went to visit him. On the wall was a rubbing of the new stele of Hanshan Temple, tall, beautiful, and vigorous. The ink color was as clear as a child's eyes. Looking at it, I had the joy of escaping from thoughts and flying in spirit. I asked Hufan, and I learned that the stele was recently erected in Hanshan Temple in Wuzhong, carved by Huang Huaijue. Hufan entrusted Huaijue to ship it to the temple. After the stele was erected, the abbot of the temple sent a letter to Hufan to express his gratitude. The stele was written by Zhang Ji of Cangzhou, recording the Tang Dynasty's poem "Moon Sets, Crows Cry, Frost Fills the Sky," written in running script, showing his skills. It also included a postscript saying, "I have long admired the scenic spot of Hanshan Temple. I have traveled back and forth to Wu Dou for many years, but I have not visited it once. Mr. Hufan said that my name is the same as the person who wrote the poem 'Mooring at Maple Bridge at Night' in the Tang Dynasty, so he asked me to write this poem and engrave it on stone. I only take the meaning of lasting fame and truth, and I do not presumptuously imitate the poet." Below is Hufan's postscript: "I said that Mr. Zhang Junquan was the same as Zhang Ji of the Tang Dynasty, so I asked Mr. Pu Boxin to ask him to write the poem 'Mooring at Maple Bridge at Night.' Unexpectedly, after the writing was completed, Duke Pu passed away the next day, so it became his last work. This is also a karmic connection from a previous life. I ordered it to be engraved on stone and erected in the mountains of Hanshan Temple to leave this good story, and I will engrave the two characters of Duke Pu below. This is truly a gift for the historians to preserve."

The letter said: "Mr. Hufan, from Shanghai. Thank you for your kind reception. I have been busy with worldly affairs since we parted, and the incident has not yet been reported. I am deeply sorry for the delay. The poem 'Mooring at Maple Bridge at Night' has been repeatedly urged. Because Zhang Pulao has been too tired recently, he finished writing it only three days ago, and he passed away the next night. This paper is really his last work. The colleagues at the History Museum wanted to keep it. Then, because Duke's feelings for this paper are beyond description, he should send the original to you. However, I hope that after you engrave it on stone, you will still return the original paper to the History Museum so that Zhong Qi can preserve it as

Prices eased slightly in late May, but on the 4th and 5th of this month, prices in Nanjing and Shanghai began to stir again. According to Nanjing reports, the highest authorities are paying unusual attention to this. The Executive Yuan has also agreed on countermeasures to suppress the rising tide, which will be implemented in sequence. But how to suppress the rising tide of prices? In the past decade, the authorities have tried various methods, such as: (1) price limits, (2) price negotiations, (3) price labeling, (4) selling off reserves, (5) strictly prohibiting speculation and hoarding, (6) tightening credit, (7) restricting exports and re-exports, (8) strictly enforcing supervision and inspection, and (9) implementing rationing. More or less, all of these have been promoted to a considerable extent. However, a glance at the price index tables in various places reveals that these measures have not only been completely ineffective, but have actually intensified the trend of rising prices despite efforts to suppress them. Therefore, if the new Executive Yuan wants to stabilize prices, it must take further steps and make fundamental and prompt remedies.

In fact, the so-called fundamental solutions are well known to everyone, namely two paths: (1) stop printing money; (2) increase production. Because prices are a comparison between currency and goods. If currency continues to inflate while the supply of goods cannot meet demand, then no amount of skill can forcibly suppress prices. Regarding the cessation of currency inflation, we have advocated using the proceeds from the sale of US aid goods to make up for the deficit in public finances, thereby alleviating the issuance of new currency. Recent statements from relevant authorities have also largely advocated this. If agreement can be reached with the US, it seems that there will be no major problems on this path. Furthermore, on the day of his inauguration, the new Minister of Finance, Wang, also declared that the Ministry of Finance's administration would still focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. If this statement can be truly realized, and supplemented by the aforementioned US aid, we believe that at least in the short term, currency inflation, even if it cannot be completely stopped, can at least be temporarily eased, and there is always hope.

However, how to effectively promote increased production remains to be seen and requires much effort. The movement to increase production is not a new concept. Slogans and plans for increasing grain production, cotton production, silk cocoon production, etc., have long been familiar to everyone. However, in recent years, the actual numbers have not shown a significant increase. Moreover, the various products that can be obtained are often stranded in the fields due to obstacles such as banditry and transportation, and cannot be smoothly processed or reach the final consumer. When they fortunately reach the manufacturing stage, they often encounter imbalances in supply and demand and suffer from stagnation and slow sales due to various unreasonable controls, power, machinery, and funding constraints. On the surface, the movement to increase production is vigorously promoted, but in reality, it is being forced in the direction of reduced production. Coupled with the abundance of speculative capital and rampant speculation, how can the rising tide of prices be curbed? But from our perspective, in order to adjust supply and demand and stabilize prices, the following four measures must be effectively implemented in the future to increase production:

First, stabilize the production environment, including improving labor-management relations, improving conscription and grain policies, and strengthening local security. The goal is to ensure that those engaged in production, whether farmers or workers, can work with peace of mind and be happy to serve the public, and that entrepreneurs can operate freely within the framework of reasonable laws and regulations, without any worries. Only in this way can various production undertakings proceed smoothly.

Second, alleviate the suffering of merchants and the people. On the surface, all government measures are intended to benefit merchants and the people. Words such as "encouragement," "promotion," and "assistance" are everywhere. In reality, however, the benefits to merchants and the people are far less than the pain of being bound and exploited. This is partly due to poor implementation and partly due to incomplete legislation. The Legislative Yuan should immediately make sweeping reforms, thoroughly eliminating all cumbersome, harsh, repetitive, and meaningless laws and procedures, and truly start anew with the people, so that merchants and the people feel a sense of intimacy and love towards the government, and do not harbor suspicion and oppression. Only then can government and business genuinely cooperate and production be actively promoted.

Third, reduce the burden on merchants and the people. During this period of constitutional government and suppression of rebellion, expenses are enormous, and taxes are especially needed. It is naturally necessary to actively increase revenue and tax collection, as Minister Wang said, in order to avoid a sharp increase in currency issuance. This is something that the public can understand and accept. The great concerns are: (1) tax rates are sometimes too high, hindering production and causing the so-called "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs" phenomenon; (2) overlapping and repetitive taxation; (3) ostensibly implementing control measures but actually seeking profit, allowing general officials to use their positions to engage in petty calculations; (4) various localities arbitrarily establish names and arbitrarily levy taxes and donations without limit. Various public and private apportionments are especially novel and endless. This not only increases costs, making it impossible for producers and consumers to bear the burden, but also demands without limit, making it impossible to calculate costs, further delivering a fatal blow to producers.

Fourth, increase the convenience of finance. As a result of the sharp decline in deposits due to currency inflation, the financial resources of general commercial banks are now greatly diminished compared to the past. To promote the activities of industry and commerce and the smooth progress of production undertakings, national banks cannot but adopt more proactive measures, channeling funds through commercial banks as much as possible to maximize the effectiveness of finance. The current policy of tightening credit, while not without temporary effects in terms of addressing the symptoms, has caused commerce to stagnate and production to inevitably be hindered. Moreover, tightening and loosening credit from time to time only makes legitimate merchants exhausted and unwilling to operate freely, while speculators can take advantage of the intermittent weaknesses, which runs counter to the goal of stabilizing prices. As for restricting domestic remittances and restricting the transportation of cash, this is tantamount to building a high levee in the middle of the exchange of goods, preventing the free exchange of raw materials and finished products, which is especially incompatible with the movement to increase production.

### Mystery of Pyramid-Shaped, Huge Structure: Rumors of Discovery in Guanzhong, But No Factual Proof

[This newspaper, Xi'an dispatch, 6th] Foreign media have repeatedly exaggerated the story that a pyramid-shaped, huge structure exists in Guanzhong and was recently discovered from the air by a foreign pilot. There is no factual proof here, and many believe that this may be just a "Uncle Sam" publicity stunt. General Cha Fei, who is familiar with the aerial topography of this area, told reporters that he and his colleagues were initially interested in this and often took the opportunity to explore, but have not found any trace of it. However, there is a small hill in the southwest of the Qinling Mountains, namely the Zhongnan Mountains, that is slightly geometric in shape, which may be the source of this rumor. Another archaeological expert believes that it may be a mistaken reference to a certain imperial tomb, such as the Mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang at the foot of Lishan Mountain in Lintong, which is 1,200 feet high and round at the top and square at the bottom, or the Maoling Mausoleum of Emperor Wu in Xingping County, which is 300 feet square. Both have square bases similar to the huge pyramid-shaped structures that we know of. As for the "pyramid" recently discovered, with its four sides painted in four different colors of red, green, etc., as reported by foreigners, this may be seen in a Disney color cartoon, but there would never be such a groundbreaking construction in ancient or even modern China.

### Kunming Observation Post Newspaper Destroyed by Students

[This newspaper, Kunming dispatch, 6th] Before the incident of the destruction of the Fuxing Evening News by Kunhua Agricultural School was over, the Kunming Observation Post was surrounded on the evening of the 5th by Duan Yishen, a military training instructor from Kunhua Commercial School, and 145 students. The business department was completely destroyed, and slogans such as "Observation is not clear, investigation is not bright" were written in large characters with asphalt. Afterwards, Zhang Dajun, the interview director of the newspaper, was kidnapped and imprisoned in a small house in the school. They shouted slogans along the way, with a fierce momentum. Military police stopped them to no avail. The cause of the incident was that the newspaper published a reader's letter on May 19, stating that a certain vocational school's dean of academics, Liu, and a staff member, Luo, had an ambiguous relationship. After it was published, Kunhua Commercial School sent a letter to the newspaper for correction. After the newspaper complied, this atrocity suddenly occurred half a month later. Members of the news profession are indignant about this and unanimously support the newspaper. They convened an emergency meeting of the press association to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that the Observation Post was founded by Long Chunwu, the eldest son of former Chairman Long Yun. Relevant authorities also attach great importance to this.
