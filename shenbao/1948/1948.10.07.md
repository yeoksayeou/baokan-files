### Decision to Increase Dividends on State-Owned Enterprise Stocks

To Encourage People to Purchase Enthusiastically

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 6th, inviting the Ministry of Transportation, the Resources Commission, and other agencies to discuss how to make the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks smoother and improve the technology for selling them. Deng Hanliang, Director of the Department of Commerce, and Fei Mingyang, Director of the Department of Control, both attended. As a result of the exchange of opinions, it was decided that in order to make people more enthusiastic about purchasing state-owned enterprise stocks, dividends should be increased and the priority rights of private shares should be determined. The dividend for China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC) was previously set at 5% per share for government shares and 1% per share for private shares. In the future, the dividend for private shares will be further increased according to the original standard. At the same time, it is hoped that the Ministry of Transportation and the Resources Commission will do the same for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC), Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC), and Taiwan Paper Corporation (TPC). Regarding the determination of the priority rights of private shares, various methods will be adopted, such as the priority dividend rights of private shares and increasing the management rights of private shares, so that private shareholders can participate more in the board of directors and supervisors. In addition, opinions were exchanged on the issue of guaranteed interest, and it was generally believed that the government should still provide interest to private shareholders when the company does not make money and there are no dividends to distribute. The various points decided at the meeting will be made into suggestions by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce next week after the Ministry of Transportation and the Resources Commission submit written opinions, and will be sent to the government for adoption in order to facilitate the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, but the basic methods and principles of the sale will not be changed.

### Various Committees of the Legislative Yuan Promote Work Separately; Draft Amendments to the Principles of Confidential Meetings of the Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The various committees of the Legislative Yuan discussed and promoted their work separately on the 6th. In the morning, the Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the standards for treaty cases and cases concerning the Sino-US Commercial Treaty Protocol, etc. The National Defense Committee secretly discussed the National Defense Department Organization Act. The Economic Affairs Committee and the Finance Committee each held a convener's meeting to discuss the agenda. The Budget Committee secretly discussed the review procedure for the general budget and passed it with amendments. The Labor Committee reviewed the Trade Union Law draft. The Commercial Law Committee discussed the rules of procedure and the opinion letter from the Electrical Engineering Association regarding the Electricity Law and the opinion letter from the Banking Association forwarding the opinions of the China Industrial Bank on the Banking Law, etc. In the afternoon, the Legal Affairs Committee amended and passed the "Draft Principles for Confidential Meetings of the Legislative Yuan." The Social Affairs Committee reviewed the draft amendments to the Farmers' Association Law.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the morning of the 6th to process the cases submitted by the Yuan for review. More than 30 members attended, chaired by Cheng Tianfang. First, they discussed the "Executive Yuan's consultation on the US Senate's resolution on the Sino-US Commercial Treaty Protocol, requesting review to facilitate compliance." This case was because the US Senate, when approving the Sino-US Commercial Treaty Protocol, reserved the US government's rejection of Article 5(c) of the Protocol regarding the protection of translations of literary and artistic works, and that the relevant provisions of the 1903 Sino-US Supplementary Treaty of Commerce and Navigation should still apply to this issue before the two countries negotiate a protection agreement. The US Embassy then consulted our side for their opinion. The Executive Yuan considered this reservation to be a formal change to the treaty and first consulted the Yuan for review. After the Yuan submitted it to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review, the members expressed their opinions on this case and decided to invite representatives from relevant government departments to attend and explain, and to ask academic circles and groups to provide opinions before further discussion. The second case was: "Executive Yuan's consultation on four temporary specific standards regarding treaties, requesting review." Li Baohong, a specialist of the Foreign Affairs Committee, presented his research opinion on this issue, arguing that the scope of "treaties" should be expanded to include all kinds of international diplomatic documents with important content, which is very different from what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted to the Executive Yuan for consultation to the Legislative Yuan. Some members believed that all international diplomatic measures, such as the Foreign Minister's attendance at the UN General Assembly on behalf of the government, should also be approved by the Legislative Yuan, and that the review by the Legislative Yuan should not be circumvented by distinguishing between "treaties" and "executive agreements." However, most members believed that this issue was worth discussing and that it involved the interpretation of constitutional provisions, and that it should be decided by the Council of Grand Justices. After much debate, no result was reached, and it was decided to continue the discussion at the next meeting. Finally, the candidates for members of the Financial Committee to jointly conduct a preliminary review of the proposal by Zhang Qingzhen and others that "the Executive Yuan should be urged to formulate and implement specific measures as soon as possible for the registration, management, and administration of foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens deposited abroad, so as to be effective" were nominated, and the meeting adjourned at around 12:00 noon.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th, chaired by Li Hanming, to discuss the review procedure for the general budget. As a result, according to the opinion of the general meeting, Articles 7 and 9 were amended, and it was decided to submit a report to the Yuan meeting on the 8th. If approved, the review will proceed according to the procedure. Premier Weng, Minister Wang, and Director Xu of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics will be invited to the Yuan next Tuesday to report.

âDedicated to the First Economic Control Conference of the Shanghai Areaâ

Following the expansion of the Shanghai Economic Control Zone, the first economic control conference of the two municipalities and three provinces of Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is being held in the capital today. In addition to discussing the control of materials and the rationing of daily necessities, the conference will also review the connection between economic controls in the two municipalities and three provinces. The mayors of the two municipalities and the chairmen of the three provinces will personally participate in the discussions, demonstrating the importance of this economic conference. Especially today, when panic buying has occurred in various cities and Shanghai is about to become an economic island, we naturally attach particular importance to the first economic control conference held by the two municipalities and three provinces.

Everyone recognizes that the success or failure of our country's current currency reform is not only a matter of life and death for the 450 million people across the country, but also a key to the honor, disgrace, rise, and fall of the nation. Therefore, both the government and the public hold the expectation of "only success, no failure" for this currency reform. However, the success of currency reform depends half on the economic control methods after the currency reform, and even more on the soundness of the reform plan itself. Of course, the government officials will insist that the plan itself is bold and powerful, thorough and appropriate, and that success or failure depends on the people's belief and support. And among the general public, it can be said that they wholeheartedly supported it in the first month, especially the citizens of Shanghai. But scholars and experts are worried about how to remedy some of the loopholes in the plan itself. Naturally, the government will use control methods to remedy this. Therefore, the authorities have attached particular importance to strengthening economic control from beginning to end. In addition to establishing an Economic Control Commission under the Executive Yuan, economic control supervisors were also established in the four major cities of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Chongqing to be stationed in various places to promote various measures to stabilize the economy; particular emphasis was placed on the economic control of the Shanghai area, and Yu Hongjun and Jiang Jingguo were sent to Shanghai as supervisors. Of course, everyone believes that Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in the country, the source of speculation and hoarding, and that every time prices soared in the past, the rising winds always blew from Shanghai to various places. As long as the economic control of the Shanghai area is done well, prices in various places will naturally follow Shanghai's lead. Although some people with broader vision pointed out that economic matters may not be so simple, Shanghai can affect the interior, and the interior can also strike Shanghai. However, the speakers spoke earnestly, but the listeners were dismissive. But what is the reality after a month and a half? Now it is clear to all.

Under the iron fist of Supervisor Jiang in the Shanghai area, eliminating the black market, eradicating speculation, banning hoarding, regulating the supply of materials, and guarding the "August 19" price limit defense line, it cannot be denied that the economic control in the Shanghai area has initially achieved great success. But if we look at the prices in Chongqing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Tianjin, in the month and a half after the currency reform, they have all risen by one to three times. Although the calls to "follow Shanghai's lead" and "learn from Jiang Jingguo" can be heard almost everywhere, have they really followed? We sincerely admire Supervisor Jiang's work in controlling the economy, but at the same time, we are very worried for him. The temporary stabilization of prices in Shanghai for more than forty days, although it has not completely rescued the citizens of Shanghai from the depths of misery, has at least given the people oppressed by high prices a chance to breathe. Moreover, Jiang's hard-working, fast-paced, and pragmatic attitude and his enthusiasm for serving the people not only refreshed the ears and eyes of the whole country, but also established a new style of politics, which can have a great effect in winning people's hearts. In today's "people's hearts yearning for change," Jiang Jingguo's performance in Shanghai can be seen not only as the starting point of a "new deal," but also as a beacon of hope for the people of the whole country. This is why we admire him so much; however, this is also why we are so worried.

Why worry? There are three reasons:

First, the economic power of the Shanghai area is not enough. Supervisor Jiang is facing thorny roads in promoting his economic control work in Shanghai. Many enemies are lurking around him, and they are intentionally and unintentionally trying to break through this "August 19" defense line at all times, giving the impression that "the Tao is one foot high, but the demon is ten feet high." Therefore, although Shanghai's prices are still guarding the first line of defense of "August 19," it is undeniable that Shanghai has become an economically isolated island! At present, the economic isolation of Shanghai from other regions, the depression of the business community, and the reduction of work in various factories have caused production to show signs of contraction. At the same time, the oversupply of floating capital has made the "August 19" defense line precarious. Furthermore, due to the resurgence of the citizens' psychology of "valuing goods over money," a panic buying wave has also occurred in Shanghai. If this bad situation is allowed to evolve naturally, not only will the prices in various places not follow Shanghai's lead, but Shanghai may be forced to follow the prices in various places. Originally, economic affairs are like a ring without end, closely related to each other, and decisions are interdependent. There is no possibility of "throwing a whip to stop the flow." Supervisor Jiang's economic control work in the Shanghai area can at most be expanded to the two municipalities and three provinces. Regardless of how the two municipalities and three provinces carry out their economic control work and keep pace, even if they do as well as Shanghai in the past month and a half, what about the areas outside the two municipalities and three provinces? Therefore, the success of economic control in the Shanghai area cannot rely on the strength of the Shanghai area alone, nor can it rely solely on the strength of several members of the Suppression and Construction Brigade, let alone rely solely on the strength of Supervisor Jiang alone, but depends on how closely the overall economic control work across the country is coordinated and how to strengthen its strength.

Second, the government has not yet had any real manifestation of encouraging increased production, but wants to rely on an iron fist to permanently maintain the price limit, which is too difficult for Supervisor Jiang. Strictly enforcing price limits is like using an ice pack for a feverish patient, taking sleeping pills for an insomnia patient, or giving a cardiac tonic to a patient with heart failure. This is only a temporary measure to treat the symptoms, and the source of the disease cannot be cured by relying solely on these drugs. But in the past month and a half, in addition to asking doctors to use these methods for treatment, what efforts has the government made to help increase agricultural products and factory-made products? On the contrary, it only wants to use the method of rigid price limits to suppress the prices of agricultural products, and to use rigid restrictions to block the source of raw materials for factories and to cut off the way for factory-made products, making an industrial city and the rural areas of the interior economically disjointed. How can this increase production? If production does not increase, but consumption is unlimited, we are very worried about the future of economic control work in the Shanghai area.

Third, the central government officials have not only failed to balance the national treasury's revenue and expenditure and do not have the courage to implement methods to maintain the value of the gold yuan currency, but instead constantly issue indiscriminate remarks and stimulate the people's trust in the gold yuan. It must be known that the focus of the economic reform plan is not only on reforming the currency system, but also on balancing the national budget. Otherwise, if the legal tender is exchanged for the gold yuan, and the government still relies on issuing currency, what will be the result? The total amount of gold yuan is 2 billion yuan, and more than 900 million yuan have been issued by the end of September. How does the government plan to recover the large amount of gold yuan, or issue less gold yuan in the future? Selling shares of state-owned enterprises without selling them individually according to each unit, but selling them in a general way, what effect can it achieve? If the sale of shares is changed, but the stock exchange is not allowed to open, what will happen if people who buy shares have an urgent need? The people have handed in a large amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency in exchange for gold yuan, but the government has not yet issued hard subsidiary coins to gain trust. It also does not have the courage to dare to transfer the large amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency that it has collected, as well as the gold, silver, and foreign exchange that the government has already controlled, to a foreign exchange fund so that the people can exchange gold yuan for foreign exchange from the Central Bank when they have legitimate needs, such as preparing production raw materials, machinery, and daily necessities, to strengthen the people's trust in the value of the gold yuan. How can it be easy to suddenly change the people's abnormal psychology of valuing goods over money? What's more, our Minister of Finance Wang openly told reporters in the United States that we need US aid of 500 million US dollars per year for two or three years to balance revenue and expenditure. If what is reported is true, isn't this openly making fun of the gold yuan currency? There is no courage to rectify tax collection, and there is no courage to adjust the prices of transportation and public utilities, and the national treasury still has to subsidize a large amount. The salaries of public officials and teachers must be increased. If this is the case, when can the national treasury's revenue and expenditure be balanced? If this cannot be done, it is the fundamental cause of all difficulties. But hoping for the success of economic control in the Shanghai area seems too extravagant.

Therefore, we believe that the key to ensuring the success of economic control does not lie in the Shanghai area, but in the central government's decision-making and in the implementation throughout the country!

### Panic Buying Remains Rampant in Various Locations

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 6th] Panic buying is still very prevalent in Hangzhou. Shops are greatly alarmed. Mayor Zhou specially convened a conversation with various industries on the morning of the 6th. Various industries put forward requests, the main ones being to open up the source of goods, to require Shanghai manufacturers to have rationing rights, to require legal profits, and to limit the quantity of goods purchased. The municipal government accepted and forwarded them to Jiang Jingguo, and decided to limit the quantity purchased. Shops must still maintain eleven hours of business.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] The market in Suzhou is becoming increasingly bleak today. Shops are decorating their windows with a small amount of inferior goods, barely coping with retail sales. Cigarettes have been out of stock for three days. Edible oil must be purchased from oil shops outside the city to obtain a small amount. Rice shops are using low-quality reddish-brown unpolished rice mixed with grains and chaff to supply the market. Ordinary people are complaining loudly.

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 6th] The market price of coarse grains in Wuxi is lower than that in Suzhou and Shanghai. Few merchants transport goods to Wuxi. The market is sluggish. Very little japonica rice is arriving. There is slightly more indica rice. There is a price for white japonica rice, but no goods. Mostly inferior goods are used to supply the market. People are competing to buy flour. Restaurants are mostly not using chicken in banquets because the price of chicken exceeds the price limit by one time.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 6th] Recently, the local silk and cloth have been purchased competitively by ordinary citizens due to the ban on exports from the production areas of Wuxi and Shanghai. Sales have increased sharply, reaching a state of panic buying. In order to prevent the smuggling of materials to bandit areas, the guild has specially requested the government authorities to impose restrictions and require purchases to be made with a national identity card. In addition, the consumption tax rate has been adjusted. In addition to the new price of cigarettes being approved and announced, the prices of both northern and southern miscellaneous goods have now been submitted for adjustment.

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 6th] The evil wind of panic buying in Yangzhou has not subsided. The prices of various goods have risen to the original prices of August 19.

After posting a sign saying "Please come early tomorrow," they closed one after another. The Economic Control Authority held an emergency meeting today, approving various industries to operate on a set schedule from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and advising on opening up sources and supplying as much as possible to maintain the appearance of the city.

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 6th] A shopping spree has swept into Wuhu. Silk and cloth shops and foreign goods stores are all crowded and have stopped selling early. Department stores and grocery stores have a lot of goods and are still open. Yarn gold is out of stock and has been out of stock for many days. The rice market has been out of stock for three days, and a black market has emerged. Those responsible for economic control seem to be waiting for the new decisions of the Nanjing Economic Control Conference and have taken no action. Poor people who cannot buy rice are complaining.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] After a period of price fluctuations in Hankou, some goods have disappeared again. Citizens are rushing to buy daily necessities in the markets starting today to store them. Customers are crowding the national goods company. The order is chaotic, resulting in them being forced to lock the doors and refuse to sell. According to a police investigation, more than 500 shops throughout the city are hoarding goods and selling them privately, and rising prices and black markets are becoming increasingly rampant.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] After the panic buying wind swept Beiping, the first such phenomenon occurred on Wangfujing Street. At 11:00 AM on the 6th, the entrances to department stores, woolen fabric shops, and cloth shops on Wangfujing Street were extremely crowded. In the afternoon, it spread to Qianmen Xidan, so many shops closed at 4:00 PM. People are extremely uneasy. After the police department asked the municipal government for instructions, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department are now negotiating a solution. Most of the panic buyers are vendors and merchants.

### Nantong Native Cloth Sales Boom; Cotton Yarn Supply Insufficient

[Our Nantong Dispatch, 6th] Yesterday, the native cloth market received more than 18,000 feet of cloth, setting an unprecedented record. After selling cloth, machine households used cloth strips to purchase yarn from yarn shops, resulting in an insufficient supply of cotton yarn throughout the city. The cloth sold was equivalent to 500 pieces of yarn, but the yarn sold was still short 200 pieces. The weaving households negotiated with the yarn industry association, and they agreed to register and gradually ration the yarn before dispersing. The native cloth market was specially closed today for one day to facilitate the yarn shops' continued supply of cotton yarn.

### Overseas Chinese in Malaya Receive Protection; Article 7 of the Sino-British New Treaty Implemented; Our Consulate to Be Notified of Any Arrests

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] News from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Since the communist riots in Malaya, the British authorities have arrested a large number of suspected criminals under emergency laws, among whom overseas Chinese account for the majority. According to Article 7 of the Sino-British New Treaty, whenever an overseas Chinese is arrested, the local government should notify our consulate. This provision, in addition to being implemented in Singapore after our negotiations last October, has not yet been implemented in Malaya due to the implementation of the new constitutional system and our adjustment of consulates. In order to intensify the protection of overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed our Consulate General in Singapore to negotiate with the British side that the treaty should still be implemented. Subsequently, the consulate replied that the British side had agreed to do so, but that Malaya would have to wait until the areas of jurisdiction of the new consulates were determined and they were officially opened before it could be implemented. Now that our consulates in Malaya have been established separately, and the areas of jurisdiction of each consulate have also been notified to the British authorities, the Consulate General in Kuala Lumpur has sent a letter to the Malayan authorities requesting immediate implementation. According to reliable sources, the Government of the Federation of Malaya has instructed the police to notify our relevant consulates immediately when overseas Chinese are arrested. Article 7 of the Sino-British New Treaty has now been implemented throughout Malaya.

According to the order, all yarn exchanges in Chongqing will be cancelled in the future, and yarn factories will jointly form a joint sales office to distribute yarn directly to cloth factories and users through retail departments, thereby cracking down on yarn merchants making profits in the middle and creating a black market for cotton yarn.

### Yulin Hainan Iron Ore to Re-enter into Contract with Allied Headquarters

Continuing to Supply 200,000 Tons of Ore to Japan

[Our Newspaper, Haikou, 5th] Yulin Hainan

### Hu Shi Lectures on the International Situation: If Major Powers Maintain Clear Attitude, World War Can Be Avoided; Otherwise, the Global Situation Is Not Optimistic

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th] Hu Shi gave a lecture in Hankou on the 6th, discussing his observations on the international situation. He began by pointing out the tragic defeat of Germany and Japan as the greatest tragedy of the past 50 years. He also cited Zhang Qun's report on his visit to Japan, reiterating that the United States would not support the rearmament of Japan. Regarding whether a third world war is imminent, Hu Shi stated that the main factor leading to war is the mutual suspicion among major powers. The First World War occurred because Britain was unwilling to show its cards, and America's attitude was ambiguous. The formation of the Second World War was due to America's failure to truly show its cards initially, leading Japan to mistakenly believe in America's neutrality facade and launch the war. Hu Shi said that now the United States has declared its "firm" and "patient" stance. If the attitudes of the major powers can remain clear, then a major war can be avoided. However, Hu Shi warned the audience that humans are the most foolish creatures. If someone, like Hitler, stubbornly refuses to believe this card, then the effect of showing one's hand will be limited, and the global situation remains far from optimistic. After successful mining explosions at the Iron Ore Bureau, September's output increased to 95,000 tons. Further explosions of more than 100,000 tons before November will complete this year's output. The Bureau recently re-entered into a new contract with the Allied Headquarters for 200,000 tons of ore. The Allied Headquarters has decided to send engineer Ye Luobi to Hainan again to assist in mining. As for the first batch of 250,000 tons of ore to be shipped to Japan, 210,000 tons have already been shipped.

### Representatives from Chahar Province Petitioning in Nanjing Present Ten Demands to the Central Government

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Du Jimei, Speaker of the Chahar Provincial Assembly, Cui Yunshan, Councilor, Bai Baojin, Director of the Department of Finance, and other representatives from Chahar Province who are petitioning in Nanjing, have been continuously calling on central government authorities in Nanjing to appeal regarding the situation in Chahar Province. Du and others held a reception for reporters at 3 pm on the afternoon of the 6th, reporting on the recent situation in Chahar Province and the demands of the people. Du and others pointed out in their report that Chahar Province is rich in resources and located at the forefront of national defense. In the past, the Japanese were keen to develop it, but our central government has not given it special attention. Chahar Province has a population of only 2.7 million. It has contributed troops and supplies to support the suppression of rebellion. In the past two years, it has contributed 150,000 troops, accounting for 15% of the able-bodied men, all of whom are fighting outside the province. There are only security teams in the province, lacking sufficient salaries and equipment, and the central government continues to neglect Chahar Province. The allocation of relief supplies is very small, and the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants is divided into provincial and county levels, making it impossible for the Department of Finance to distribute salaries.

### The Flow of Speculative Capital to the South Becomes More Intense: The Economic Supervision Office in Guangzhou Telegrams the Executive Yuan, Requesting a Swift Regulation on the Limit of Cash Carried by Travelers Heading South

### Major Japanese Bribery Scandal Implicates the Government: Ashida Cabinet to Submit Resignation Today; Socialist Party Withdraws Support for the Government Due to Nishio's Sudden Re-arrest; Yoshida Shigeru Seems Likely to Make a Comeback

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] The Ashida Cabinet decided to hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting on the morning of the 7th to collect the resignations of the cabinet members. They will then visit MacArthur to report on the process of the collective resignation before formally completing the resignation procedures.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] After the Ashida Cabinet decided to resign collectively on the 7th, some people predicted that the next cabinet would be based on national unity, that is, a coalition government formed by the extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party, Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party, and National Cooperative Party, with a member of the Democratic Liberal Party as prime minister. If so, then former Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru may take office as prime minister for the third time.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] Senior government officials said on the 6th that the Ashida Cabinet, which has been in power for seven months, will resign after holding an emergency meeting on the morning of the 7th as a result of the development of the Showa Denko bribery scandal. The government stated that Ashida's decision to resign was issued after the Social Democratic Party held a central executive committee meeting on the afternoon of the 6th and decided to withdraw its support for the cabinet. The Social Democratic Party is one of the three pillars of the cabinet. The party held a central executive committee meeting to discuss the position of the cabinet after former Deputy Prime Minister Nishio was arrested on the morning of the 6th. The left-wing members of the party had "demanded the resignation of the cabinet" after the arrest of the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, Kurusu, last week. Although Nishio is one of the leaders of the party, he resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister several months ago due to a case of accepting bribes from a contractor. This time, he was involved in the Showa Denko case again. The party leaders voted on the 6th to demand the resignation of the government due to the public moral responsibility of cabinet members being arrested. Ashida convened a meeting of the leaders of the three government parties on the evening of the 6th. It is said that the cabinet had no other option but to resign. At this meeting, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Katayama Tetsu, had already decided to demand the resignation of the cabinet. If Ashida refused, the party would withdraw from the cabinet. The party occupies six ministries in the cabinet, and this action will certainly determine the fate of the Ashida Cabinet.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] Former Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party and former Deputy Prime Minister Nishio was arrested by the police on the morning of the 6th in connection with the Showa Denko bribery case. Nishio appeared at the Ministry of Justice at 6:40 a.m. and is expected to be detained in prison tonight. Officials from the Ministry of Justice searched his residence in Tokyo this morning and reportedly found many incriminating documents. Sato of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was also summoned to the Ministry of Justice. It is said that he had persuaded Nishio to settle the Showa Denko bribery case. It is also said that Nishio had received millions of yen in bribes from Showa Denko. The chairman of the company, Hinohara Mizu, has been charged with illegally borrowing loans from the government's Financial Reconstruction Corporation and has been imprisoned for several days. Leaders from major Japanese business and financial circles who are related to this case have also been imprisoned. The first leader of the Democratic Liberal Party to be arrested was Ono, who was arrested last month. In addition, Ozawa, a member of the Democratic Liberal Party, was also arrested last night on suspicion of bribing Kurusu, the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. Kurusu himself was arrested on September 30 in connection with the Showa Denko case.

### The United States Decides to Maintain Its Position in Berlin: Willing to Open a Foreign Ministers' Conference If the Blockade Is Lifted; Soviet Representative Attends Security Council and Listens to Jessup's Speech

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, Radio on the 6th: When the Security Council met on the morning of the 6th to debate the Berlin crisis, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky sat quietly and listened. At first, he expressed concern, and then gradually showed boredom. At the second meeting in the afternoon, Vyshinsky returned to the conference room, but he still did not indicate whether he would break his silence and participate in the debate.

[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The Security Council convened at 10:50 a.m. this morning. U.S. Representative Jessup declared that the United States would never yield to the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. At that time, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky sat silently in the hall listening to the American statement. At the same time, Jessup proposed a compromise solution, saying that if the Soviet Union lifted the Berlin blockade, the West would be willing to meet with it at a foreign ministers' conference. Although Vyshinsky had denounced the UN General Assembly's debate on the Berlin crisis as an "illegal" act on the 5th and said that he would boycott it, he still attended on the 6th to listen to the West's accusations against Soviet policy. He arrived 20 minutes late, but Chairman Brahmaglia of Argentina waited for Vyshinsky and the young Ukrainian representative Tarasenko to sit down at the horseshoe-shaped table before announcing the start of the meeting.

Jessup used strong language, indirectly warning the Soviet Union that the United States would use force if necessary to maintain its position in Berlin. He accused the Soviet Union of using "methods of aggressive action and hostile threats" to implement the "illegal" blockade of Berlin's railways and waterways, infringing on the rights and responsibilities of the United States stationed there. Jessup was calm and his tone was moving. He first read the preface to his speech for ten minutes, saying, "The world knows that the Soviet Union is illegally using the threat of force to obstruct the Western countries' access to Berlin." He also said that the United Nations Charter recognizes the need and right to self-defense in the event of an armed attack. If the action is aggressive and threatens the use of force, it is still an act of aggression and a threat to peace, even if it does not immediately lead to armed conflict." Jessup proposed a "strong and decisive formula" to resolve the Berlin crisis, but without further explanation, only pointing out two possible immediate steps: (1) If the blockade is lifted, convene a foreign ministers' conference; (2) The Security Council can still use peaceful resolution methods such as negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, and legal judgment.

While Jessup was speaking, Vyshinsky listened attentively and took notes from time to time, sometimes reading the newspaper.

### British Representative Speaks

Security Council Adjourns Until Next Week

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, Radio on the 6th: When the Security Council met in the afternoon, British Representative Cadogan said, "The British government is deeply regretful to learn that the Soviet delegation is unwilling to participate in the discussion of the Berlin issue. Does the Soviet Union have no opinion, or has it decided to refuse any proposal from the Security Council in silence? Is this the Soviet delegation's way of seeking peace and understanding? If one party refuses to participate in the discussion, how can we resolve the dispute?" Cadogan made the same suggestion: If the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade, a four-power foreign ministers' conference can be convened. The Security Council adjourned on the evening of the 6th and may be postponed until next week to give the Soviet Union the opportunity to consider accepting the Western proposal.

### Stalemate on the Issue of Controlling Atomic Energy: The Soviet Union Insists on Its Original Proposal; Britain Asks Three Questions and Does Not Receive Satisfactory Answers

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, Radio on the 6th: British Minister of State McNeil launched a fierce attack on the Soviet Union's actions that threaten peace, demanding a definite answer from the Soviet Union on whether it agrees to first control atomic energy and then destroy the atomic bomb. He said: The United Kingdom and the United States "are unwilling to give information about the atomic bomb to other countries conditionally."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] British Representative McNeil raised the following three questions to the Soviet delegation: (1) Does the Soviet Union agree to the implementation of international control before the draft treaty on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the draft treaty on atomic control are signed and take effect simultaneously; (2) Is the Soviet delegation prepared to accept the report of the majority of countries as the basis for establishing the control treaty; (3) Is the Soviet Union willing to not use the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Council for international organizations entrusted with control powers. Soviet Representative Malik replied that the Soviet Union requires the simultaneous implementation of the two draft treaties in the proposal, one on control and one on the prohibition of atomic weapons.

### Marshall Summoned by the President: Scheduled to Return Home for Duty in Two Days; Dulles Returns to Paris After Meeting Dewey

[United States Information Service, Washington, 5th] The White House announced today that Secretary of State Marshall will fly back to Washington on Saturday to report to President Truman on the progress of the Paris UN General Assembly meeting. Presidential Press Secretary Ross said that Marshall's return home does not indicate any special crisis, but is because the President wants to hear the Secretary of State's oral report. Marshall is leading the U.S. delegation to attend the meeting in Paris and will arrive here on Saturday morning on the President's special plane "Independence."

This morning, Dulles met with Republican presidential candidate Dewey in Albany, New York, to discuss the international situation. After the meeting, Dewey issued the following statement: "Dulles has reported to me on the current international situation, especially the serious problems caused by Soviet policy. I have analyzed the important issues involved, and I have expressed my opinions to him. Dulles will return to Paris tomorrow to continue his work as a member of the bipartisan delegation, which represents a united United States in the United Nations."

### Marshall Formally Denies the Rumor That the U.S. Forced France to Hold Elections; The Report That Three Parties in France Will Form a Government Is Actually Impossible

[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall completely denied on the 5th the rumor that the United States is pressuring France to hold elections. The U.S. Embassy issued a statement by Marshall saying: "Secretary of State Marshall authorized the U.S. Embassy to clearly deny the reports in the Paris newspapers that the U.S. government had warned the French government that it should hold elections as soon as possible and take certain concrete steps if it wants U.S. aid to France to continue. This statement has no basis in fact."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] Qualified sources today denounced the recent rumors that the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Communist Party will restore the "three-party government" as an impossible "fantasy." The sources pointed out that the basis of the above rumors is that two left-wing members of the Popular Republican Movement are said to have asked representatives of the Republican and Resistance Movement Alliance (the Communist Party's allied party) to join the government, but the latter replied that their party was too small and that the Popular Republican Movement should invite the Communist Party to join instead. However, there has been no new development since then, so the rumors of a three-party government are quite unreliable. The sources emphasized that neither the Socialist Party nor the Popular Republican Movement is willing to form a coalition government with the Communist Party, so a three-party government is actually impossible. As for Prime Minister Queuille's Radical Socialist Party, although it is willing to unite with the left wing, it is also willing to unite with the right wing, which is unacceptable to the Communist Party. The sources concluded that the middle parties are still trying to maintain a middle position between the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction. When it is impossible to maintain this position, it will be decided whether to turn to the left or the right.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] The Democratic and Social Union of Resistance Movements of the French Liberal Party decided at its steering committee meeting last night that the party would continue to participate in the Queuille cabinet. Some members of the party are dissatisfied with the government's wage and price policies and want to break away from the government.

### Wallace Criticizes U.S. Aid Policy to China

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, Radio on the 6th: Wallace gave a speech at the Federal Club on the 6th, launching a fierce attack on U.S. foreign policy. He said that some U.S. military officers have openly admitted that the United States is supplying aircraft and artillery to President Chiang, building China into an attack base, and preparing to participate in the war that the military is happily planning. Wallace quoted General Chennault's report to Congress in March this year, saying that modern bombers departing from Chinese airfields are closer to Soviet industrial areas than U.S. bases. Indeed, air strikes from Chinese airfields could isolate Siberia east of Lake Baikal. Chinese bases are even closer than North African bases. Wallace declared that General Marshall's efforts to form a unified and stable government in China were almost the last gasp of U.S. foreign policy. Wallace expressed his fear of war, saying, "I know that these things are not entirely our fault, nor are they the fault of other countries. At present, no country is surrounding us with bases, accumulating atomic bombs, and publishing plans to destroy us and our industry, but we are doing these things every day and every hour." Wallace also attacked Truman's policy of aiding countries fighting communism.

Greek Guerrilla Force Has Become More Powerful

Authoritative sources said that the President's report did represent the views of the U.S. government over the past year.

### Supervisory Office Orders Resolution of Civilian Food Supply; Rice Industry Representatives Pledge to Transport 200,000 Dan per Month to the Market; Guarantee to Continue Selling at Limited Prices

[Our Report] Recently, the rice supply in this city has been disrupted. Yesterday, only 43 dan of rice arrived at the North and South Markets. The Supervisory Office is paying close attention to this abnormal phenomenon and believes that a small number of rice merchants are secretly causing difficulties in order to create a food shortage and force the authorities to concede, thus fulfilling their desire to undermine price controls. Yesterday afternoon, Wan Molin and the managers of the North and South Markets, Yin Fuxiang and Xu Songshi, were summoned to the office for a discussion. Secretary Cai Baili met with them and requested Yin and Xu to be responsible for transporting 300,000 dan of rice from other places to Shanghai each month. Because the two indicated that it was difficult to agree to this, the dispute shifted in time. Secretary Cai angrily left his seat and returned to the supervisor's office to report. At that time, Chiang Ching-kuo's attitude was very tough, and he ordered that if Wan, Yin, and Xu could not be responsible for the supply of rice to Shanghai, they would be severely punished. After the repeated persuasion of Major Cheng Yi-kuan, Yin and Xu first made a pledge to be responsible for transporting 100,000 dan of rice from other cities to Shanghai each month for each market. Wan Molin also subsequently made a pledge to ensure that the city's rice shops continue to supply rice at limited prices. After the three made their pledges, Secretary Cai also stated face-to-face that he hoped that the three, with their leading positions in the rice industry, would persuade rice merchants to transport rice to Shanghai. If the control is successful, they will be permanently appreciated by the citizens. The conversation ended at 6:15 pm. When the two sides were arguing fiercely, it hit the outdoors. The personnel of the supervisor's office immediately announced: Under any circumstances, the price of rice will not rise.

Manufacturers Can Apply to Purchase on Their Own

[Our Report] New grains from various places have gradually entered the market. For the rice needed by various factories, companies, banks, and other business organizations, in addition to entrusting legitimate grain merchants to go to the producing areas to purchase successively in accordance with central regulations and not to compete for purchases in the market, those who directly purchase from the rice-producing areas are allowed to apply to the bureau for a purchase permit. However, each purchase must not exceed two months of actual needs. The procedures stipulate that the applicant must clearly state the number of people currently employed, the quantity to be purchased, the variety, and the location, and send a letter directly to the bureau's fourth section. After the section lists and signs the director for approval, it can be filled out and issued. This expedient measure has been reported separately and will be implemented from today.

### Legitimate Merchants in Various Places Are Still Allowed to Purchase and Transport Goods; Applications Can Be Made with Official Documents from the Guild

[Our Report] Since the authorities restricted the amount of daily necessities carried by passengers leaving the country by sea, land, and air to no more than one person's needs yesterday, the craze for panic buying has subsided slightly. However, the daily necessities of various cities in the interior originally relied on Shanghai for transportation, and there will now be panic. According to Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, the original intention of the restriction measure was to crack down on "single haulers" (illegal peddlers). The authorities will still permit legitimate merchants from various places to purchase and transport goods. The industry association can prepare official documents to apply to the supervisor's office, so that the government can also know the statistics of domestic sales. Currently, some places have applied to the supervisor's office for transporting sugar and cloth out of the country.

In addition, the Supervisor's Office announced: If factories along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines need raw materials and equipment, they can first obtain a certificate from the local industry association, and then purchase after approval by the Shanghai District Supervisor's Office.

### Suggest a General Census and Issuance of Commodity Rationing Certificates

[Our Report] Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said yesterday: The bureau is now concentrating its efforts on restricting citizens' consumption. To eliminate the current bad phenomenon, a strict and universal rationing system should be adopted, and the rationing of oil and coal can be restored in the short term. Regarding the issue of national identification cards, which is closely related to rationing, he has discussed it with Supervisor Chiang and suggested conducting another thorough census. It is planned to issue various commodity rationing certificates based on national identification cards. In the future, citizens will need to hold these two documents to purchase daily necessities, and the store selling the goods will cross out the goods sold on the rationing certificate. The current emergency method of stamping a "goods purchased" seal on the national identification card will be prone to being filled.

### Clothing Industry Requests Direct Allocation of Woolen Fabrics

[Our Report] Representatives from the Western-style clothing and fashion industry went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to request direct allocation of woolen fabrics to reduce intermediate exploitation and restrict citizens from ordering clothes, with each person limited to one suit every six months based on their national identification card. It is said that there are currently orders for Western suits that will not be delivered until next year. Customers' psychology is abnormal, and they are willing to pay first and pick up the goods several months later. Currently, most Western clothing merchants need several months to complete all orders. Fashion shops have the same phenomenon. The Social Affairs Bureau is reported to be convening relevant industries for discussion.

### Manufacturing of Fountain Pens Lacks Gold; Pen Factory Submits Application for Allocation of Raw Materials

Retailers should stamp the household registration certificate when selling and register who they are selling to one by one. The authorities are prepared to conduct spot checks at any time to prevent abuses. After the market is closed, manufacturers and wholesalers will supply 7,500 dan to retail stores each week, which will be distributed twice.

### Shanghai Journalists Association Sacrifices to Martyr Shao Xubai

The Shanghai Journalists Association, because its former member, Martyr Shao Xubai, was assassinated in Shanghai on July 1, 1940, and died heroically, the Shao Martyr Burial Committee has chosen the 7th of this month to bury him in his ancestral cemetery in Maoshan, Yin County. Therefore, a sacrificial text is offered to show loyalty and comfort the heroic spirit. The sacrificial text is recorded as follows: "On October 7, the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Journalists Association, respectfully offers clear wine and delicacies to the spirit of Martyr Shao Xubai, saying: Alas! The Japanese pirates were rampant, and they snatched Dong Hu's pen; the treacherous and cunning traitors lost the warrior's life. The light of the law was fleeting, and there were grievances for eight years. Recalling the past, it is difficult to describe with a pen. Alas, how sad! Thinking of Mr. Shao, his talent was unparalleled. He studied in Nanjing and devoted himself to writing. His family was poor and he dropped out of school, but he was skilled in trade. When the revolutionary army rose up, he participated in the secrets, valuing death over life, consistent from beginning to end. When Liaodong launched a revolt, he comforted the righteous army in the border provinces. When Li Deng arrived in the west, he submitted a strategy of ten thousand words. At the beginning of the resistance against the enemy, he formed a society for commentary, supported the national policy, and intentionally planned for survival. His pen was stern, the wind rose and rushed, exposing treachery and subduing, and the group swallowed. How could the villains be jealous of his talent, first with wealth, and then with poison, never resigning from death, his body became benevolence, and the righteousness is always there, how sad! His integrity was unflawed, and he never retreated. Heaven blessed China, and gave birth to this extraordinary talent. The auspicious signs were water divination, and the woodcutters did not destroy the mother. The cassia and orchid will be sacrificed to comfort the spirit in the spring. The spirit in the spring will know, and the soul will return, alas, how sad! May you enjoy the sacrifice.

### Interception at the North Station; Raw Materials for Drug Trafficking Privately Transported; Source and Destination Clarified; Wang Xiaofu's Scene is Lavish

[Our Report] At 11:25 pm the day before yesterday, in front of the gate of the Beijing-Shanghai District Railway Administration on Minde Road, a small railway worker came with a travel bag, intending to cross the administration plaza to the station. The gate guard saw that his behavior was suspicious and went forward to check. There were ten paper packages in the bag, each containing four yellow lumps. He said that it was a Western medicine entrusted by a friend and asked him to send it to the station. At that time, Inspector Du Gongtang happened to be patrolling here and recognized that the yellow substance was the raw material for manufacturing the drug heroin. He brought the small worker to the police station for questioning. According to the worker, the item was entrusted to him by his former neighbor named Xue Zhiguang. Xue himself was waiting at the station, intending to take the 16th Beijing-Shanghai night train to Beijing. Inspector Du and others disguised themselves and went to the station to arrest Xue. However, at this time, the 16th train had already departed, and the platform was empty. However, it was expected that Xue would not leave before obtaining the drug, so a secret search was carried out. Later, Xue was found in an empty car. At that time, the suspect Xue offered a bribe of 100 yuan in gold and a gold ring. The railway police severely rebuked him and took Xue to the interrogation office. Xue confessed to privately carrying drugs and said: The item was given to me by Yan Huisheng at the Wulu Electric Tram Station and I planned to take it to No. 1 Guapu Bridge, Erpailou, Nanjing. Yan also originally intended to go with me that night, but he has already fled. The source of the drug was provided by Wang Xiaofu. Wang's scene is very lavish on weekdays, and he has his own car to travel in and out. He only knows that he often bathes in the Shuanglongquan Bathhouse in Nanshi, but he does not know where his home is. The police department has sent personnel to investigate, but Wang has received the news and fled. He is currently being arrested from all sides.

### Zhou Zhiguang's Case of Inciting Workers Adjourned Pending Judgment

[Our Report] Zhang Zhiguang, who was dismissed by Zhang Yunju at No. 27, Huangpi South Road, was accused of inviting hundreds of workers from various factories at around 10 pm on July 10 to gather at the intersection of Huixi Street and Xuhong Road to openly give speeches, incite workers to stop working, and obstruct order in order to demand a pay raise from the capitalist. The District Court opened the trial yesterday. Bao Weiran, chairman of the Textile Workers Union, and Wang Guangxing, a director, testified in court: Ju gathered more than 100 workers on Xuhong Road that night and incited a strike by giving speeches. Zhou and his defense lawyer then defended, strongly denying that Bao and Wang's testimony was untrue. They said that the work stoppages in various factories were not due to his incitement: (1) The Huashang Electric Company stopped supplying electricity on July 11, and various factories stopped working due to the lack of electricity. (2) Ma Jindi and Weng Guangrong, workers at Zhang Yunjii, had a dispute over a fight, which caused the workers of various factories to stop working. They were involved in a lawsuit in court for injury, which was later mediated, and there are court records to prove it. (3) The number of workers gathered by Bao that night was different from what Wang said. (4) The labor-capital negotiations of the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives of the labor side to participate, which proves that Ju is a person who does not have the facts of the crime as charged. The court considered that the case was clear and scheduled to pronounce judgment in three days.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Broadcasts to the City, Pointing Out the Path for Citizens to Take, Enduring Temporary Pain to Put the Economy on the Right Track

Chiang Ching-kuo (pictured), the Economic Control Supervisor for the Shanghai District, delivered a broadcast to all citizens of Shanghai at 8:00 PM last night via Shanghai Radio, elaborating on the current economic control work and future directions. The text of his speech is as follows:

Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai: It has been 41 days since the government promulgated the Emergency Decree on Finance and Economy. In this short period, the government has implemented currency reform, stabilizing the soaring prices. This is the result of the government and the people working together with one heart and one mind. However, this is only the initial success of implementing the new economic policy. To consolidate and develop this initial success, we must continue to work hard to achieve the goals of stabilizing society and improving people's lives. In the past month, Shanghai citizens have exchanged 1,100,5652 taels of gold, 32,800,3894 US dollars, plus silver, silver dollars and Hong Kong dollars, totaling 372 million Gold Yuan. This accounts for 64% of the total amount exchanged nationwide. This figure shows how much the citizens of Shanghai support the government's currency reform policy, enriching the reserves of the Gold Yuan and providing greater assurance for the success of the currency reform. In the future, the government must strengthen economic control work to stabilize prices in the long term, thereby stabilizing people's lives.

We Will Surely Achieve the Goal of Increased Production

We demand price stability. First, the government's budget must be balanced. Second, production must be increased to match supply and demand. Third, we must practice thrift and reduce consumption. Fourth, we must eliminate hoarding and destroy the black market. The government is engaged in suppressing the rebellion for the survival of the country, so all expenditures are naturally quite large. To increase revenue, tax collection must be streamlined. The recent increase in tobacco and alcohol taxes is an important measure to balance revenue and expenditure. To ensure price stability, no taxes have been added to necessities that affect people's lives. Regarding increasing production, the government is now trying to help factories purchase raw materials from home and abroad. Considering the existing raw materials in Shanghai, the reserves of many types are quite sufficient. The current problem is to find ways to channel idle funds into production. Although this work is currently facing many difficulties, once the economy is on the right track, the goal of increasing production will surely be achieved. However, we must know that while increasing production, we must also practice thrift and reduce consumption. I hope all citizens can tighten their belts to overcome today's difficulties and uphold the spirit of self-reliance to build our country. The rationing system we are about to implement is not only for stabilizing life but also for saving consumption. Hoarding and speculation are factors that disrupt the market. In the past month and a half, the economic control authorities have taken the strictest measures to eliminate black market trading and all other speculative activities. In the future, we must continue to prevent the revival of speculative activities. As long as speculative activities are not eliminated, prices cannot be stabilized. In the future, anyone who violates the government's economic control laws will be severely punished according to law. Therefore, I hope that the people and the government can cooperate more closely to eliminate the speculative market. The ultimate goal of economic control is to put industry and commerce on the right track. Before August 19th, the deposits of Shanghai commercial banks, calculated in Gold Yuan, were only 6 million Gold Yuan, but recently, deposits have increased to 200 million Gold Yuan. Before August 19th, the interest rate was at least seven cents, but now it has fallen to five or six cents. To take a small matter as an example, due to the crackdown on speculative activities, the number of telephone calls used by Shanghai citizens last month has decreased by 40% compared to August. These facts all prove that the Shanghai economy is on the road to normalization. If bank deposits were used for production, that would be a further success.

Firmly Upholding the "August 19th" Price Limit

In recent days, some citizens have been anxious all day long, buying goods everywhere. Not only wool, cashmere yarn, and cloth have been purchased in large quantities, but even tin foil has been heavily acquired. This mentality is very abnormal. Yesterday, a friend told me that he had already bought 25 shi of rice, and also bought a lot of soybean oil, coal, and soap, so he wouldn't have to worry for a year. This concept is absolutely wrong. Ask yourself, if your family has food to eat, but one thousand or ten thousand people have no food to eat, can you eat quietly? This concept is not only wrong but also foolish. The phenomenon of "behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie corpses frozen to death" is absolutely not allowed. The government has stated that except for the increased tax on tobacco and alcohol, the prices of other goods have not been increased, and the prices of daily necessities must strictly adhere to the "August 19th" price limit. At the same time, the inventory in Shanghai is still quite sufficient. I can tell everyone that Shanghai has 6.5 million bolts of cotton cloth, 100,000 pieces of yarn, 200,000 dan of oil, and 80,000 tons of sugar. As for rice, in addition to the 500,000 zu monthly ration provided by the government, the rice supplied by rice merchants to the market only needs 250,000 shi. According to Mr. Yang Chuoan, the source of government-allocated rice will not be a problem, not only for October but also for the quantity required for November and December. The rice currently registered in rice shops is about 200,000 shi, excluding miscellaneous grains. In addition, the government has also entrusted the Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Treasury to purchase rice in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan to supply the Shanghai market. This year's harvest is also quite good, so although the current source is not very smooth, it will definitely not cause any problems. Looking at it this way, the citizens of Shanghai can rest assured and don't need to be afraid of anything. What we fear today is not a shortage of goods but a panic. If the government strictly controls prices on the one hand and the people can be content and abide by the law on the other hand, then the necessary supplies for the people will definitely not be a problem. The most important thing is that everyone should be at ease and not panic at rumors. Recently, to implement comprehensive economic control, the government has expanded the control scope of the Shanghai District to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Nanjing provinces and cities. I believe that price regulation and control within the expanded scope will achieve better results. Today, I can honestly tell all the citizens of Shanghai that controlling prices and regulating materials is indeed quite difficult. For example, regarding the reorganization of the vegetable markets, we have spent a lot of effort and have not yet reorganized them well, which is sorry to the general residents. The source of rice has not been completely smooth, which is also not a very good phenomenon. Many merchants have told me that as long as the price is increased, everything will come in abundance, but it is not that simple. According to past experience, all prices will increase by one point today and another point tomorrow, until there is no end. Therefore, I firmly stated that I would rather endure temporarily than absolutely adhere to the "August 19th" price limit. We must know that as long as there is one price concession, it will affect the overall situation. To ensure that prices can be stabilized for a long time, we must grit our teeth, work hard, and thoroughly implement the established policies. As for the places where the "August 19th" prices are not very reasonable, they can naturally be adjusted to allow industry to reproduce. But the so-called adjustment is not a price increase but simply to make the entire economy reasonable and get on the right track.

Not Letting Speculators Dream Again

I have carefully observed and realized that the people of Shanghai have recently reflected an abnormal mentality. It is said that in the past month, the business of Shanghai dance halls, cinemas, and theaters, teahouses, and restaurants has been unprecedentedly lively. There are also a particularly large number of people traveling to Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Beijing. The mentality of the general rich is mostly to live a life of "drink today while you have wine, spend today while you have money." Everyone often says that they cannot buy pork, but the number of pigs slaughtered in September was more than 10,000 more than in August. According to statistics, from July 19th to August 18th, it was 74,380, while from August 19th to September 18th, it was 86,991. These are all reflections of an abnormal mentality. We must correct this. At this moment, while I am speaking here, I am afraid that many people are still drinking and dancing wildly. How painful and pitiful are the men, women, old, and young begging on the streets now. Among them, there are probably many people who were once wealthy and influential. This contrast reminds us of the ancient Chinese saying that "extreme joy begets sorrow," which is worthy of our reflection and vigilance. I earnestly tell everyone: Today, we should pay more attention to the country's difficulties and sympathize with the people's suffering. Only when the interests of the country and the people are protected can individuals have freedom and survival. Some people in Shanghai should really wake up from their life of drunken stupor, be born again, and embark on the bright path. In the future, the citizens of Shanghai have two paths to take: The first path is to maintain the superficial prosperity, where the rich can buy whatever they want, let the speculative market flourish again, let the speculators who fled to Hong Kong, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Moganshan return to Shanghai, and stir up trouble again, disrupt the market, causing prices to soar and people to live in poverty. This is the first path. The second path is to be able to endure temporary pain, go through a difficult period, and even experience a temporary recession. Naturally, only one of these two paths can be taken. I hope everyone can use all their strength to prevent the first path and not let speculators dream of speculation again. As for the second path, as long as everyone is willing to endure difficulties and give up personal and temporary interests, it is definitely a passable path, and it is a path that must be taken.

Finally, I want to explain to everyone that I am very strict with the people participating in the economic control work in the Shanghai District, but because of the large number of people, there must be a mix of good and bad. Any cadres participating in economic control work who engage in deception and extortion outside, please do not show any mercy to tell me, and I will definitely deal with them severely. As for myself, I often feel that there are inevitably many mistakes. As the saying goes, "bystanders see clearer," you must see more clearly. I earnestly hope that everyone will point out my mistakes and criticize my shortcomings, and I will be happy to accept them. Today, when we do things, we should do what should be done and say what should be said, with unity from top to bottom and concerted efforts, to complete this arduous task. I feel very ashamed that I have not completed my own task in a month and a half of work. In the future, under the leadership of Mr. Yu Hongjun, I will do my best and work diligently to repay the expectations of the citizens of Shanghai. I wish you all good health!

### Appeal of the Dance Craze Case, First Trial Concluded, Main Points of the Defendants' Statements, All Claiming Not to Have Handed in Destruction

[Reported by this newspaper] The Dance Craze Case was concluded in the first trial by a division of the High Court yesterday, with sentencing scheduled for the 13th of this month.

The case was heard yesterday by the High Court bench, comprising President Si Wen, and judges Han Shuzhi and Zhao Qia, with Prosecutor Ye Yushao appearing in court for the prosecution. The defendants who appeared for appeal were Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, Meng Yan, Jin Ying, Li Meijuan, Shi Meifang, Qin Xianfen, Yu Zhiqin, Gu Keren, Pan Zhiguang, Wang Fulin, Zhu Caigen, Zhao Aqing, Lu Jialin, Li Ying, Xia Shaotang, Chen Ayiao, Wang Xianliang, Cheng Yinkang, Xu Jiecai, and twenty others. Ruan Jianmin did not report to the court. The defendants in custody who were brought to the court were Zhu Fei, Zhao Zhengxiang, Yu Jinbao, and Zeng Zhigang. Also present was Jin Tangshi, the mother of the defendant Jin Ying, and witness Yang Lili. Another defendant, Xu Jinhua, filed a temporary motion to withdraw her appeal and accepted the one-year prison sentence. Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, and Meng Yan, who are of particular interest, all appeared without makeup, dressed plainly, and sat side by side on the left end of the second row of the audience. Sun Hongyuan and Zheng Wei Xian, heads of the Dance Industry Association, were also in attendance.

Jin Ying's Mother Claims Her Daughter is Not a Dancer

The court opened at 9:00 AM. Each defendant stated the main points of the indictment. The general sense was that although they had participated in a petition to the Social Bureau, they had not laid a hand in the destruction. They stated they were dissatisfied with the prison sentences handed down by the District Court. Witness Yang Lili reversed her previous testimony, claiming that she did not see Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, Meng Yan, or others actually engage in destruction. As for her previous testimony, she said that the police station had forced her to sign it. Jin Tangshi stated that her daughter Jin Ying had made friends carelessly and had been associating with a dancer named Chen Juping. On that day, Chen Juping had invited her to watch the excitement at Xin Xian Lin, and her daughter was not a dancer and had not participated in the destruction of the Social Bureau. Jin Ying wept and said: I am still studying, and if I serve my sentence (three months), it will definitely affect my studies. The trial ended at around 12:00 PM.

Forced by Life Circumstances, the Situation is Not Entirely Unforgivable

The debate began at 2:00 PM. Prosecutor Ye stood up and argued that the defendants were all forced by life circumstances. Upon hearing of the dance ban, they were emotionally driven to destroy the Social Bureau. Although there is a suspicion of obstructing official duties under the law, the circumstances are not entirely unforgivable. The prosecutor asked the Criminal Court to consider the circumstances and reduce the sentences as a sign of compassion. Each of the defendants' lawyers then made their arguments. At the end of the court session, the case was scheduled for sentencing on the 13th of this month, and the court adjourned at 4:30 PM.

### Four Defendants Appeal Against Violation of the Exchange Law

### Talking about Xiangfan by the side of Mount Longzhong

â Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ling Songsheng

[Dispatch from Xuan Chang, This Newspaper, 1st of the Month] As Xiangfan becomes a cornerstone for the National Army to shield the Jianghan region during the current intense fighting in the Henan-Hubei border area, and especially after the strength of the Wanxi local troops was significantly reduced this spring, Xiangfan holds inestimable importance in monitoring the actions of the bandit Kong who dreams of entering Sichuan through the Shaanxi-Henan border. In fact, regardless of "crossing the river" or "entering Sichuan", considering the current strength and plans of the Communist bandits, they are unwilling to easily take action and deplete their forces in the short term. However, given the evolving objective environment, if the Communist bandits genuinely want to expand their roaming area outside the Central Plains battlefield, Xiangfan will invariably be a thorn in their side.

Patrolling Along the Han River Embankment

Upon arriving in Xiangyang, the reporter, together with Pang Guineng, the deputy regimental commander of a certain regiment stationed in Xicheng, rode along the Han River embankment to inspect the western suburbs of Xiangyang, where the fighting was more intense. About four or five Chinese miles west of Xiangyang city, there are three hills: Zhenwu Mountain, Lion Mountain, and Yanghu Mountain. Under normal circumstances, these three hills would certainly need to be controlled. Firstly, to block the enemy's advance with firepower and shield Xiangyang, and secondly, to prevent the enemy from occupying them and threatening Xiangyang's urban area with artillery fire. However, in the Xiangfan campaign, the bandit side did not carry any heavy weapons, so the second effect of controlling the hills was lost. Moreover, the defending forces were weak and could not reliably maintain communication lines between our army's positions and the hilltop garrison. As a result, when the Catholic Church west of the city was occupied by the enemy and the access route to the mountains was cut off, the hilltop garrison had to retreat and enter the city via the South Gate.

After Xiangfan was heavily besieged on the 9th, it was not until the 15th that the bandits broke through. There was a week of relative calm in between. During these days, the Communist bandits worked day and night to dig trenches, extending from their base directly to the west city of Xiangyang, in order to reduce their casualties. The reporter and Deputy Regimental Commander Pang patrolled the western suburbs and saw winding trenches stretching westward for dozens of miles. This was originally a clumsy method, but the Communist bandits insisted on using this clumsy method to achieve some success. As for the scattered white bones and skulls on the ground, with flesh and blood eroded by the wind and rain of the past two months, they were everywhere. Listening to the autumn wind howling through the trees and the tide of the Han River, one can only say that they were a kind of embellishment on the battlefield, with no other greater significance.

General Kang Ze's Mystery of Life and Death

After Xiangyang fell to the bandits, the whereabouts of General Kang Ze, commander of the 15th Pacification Zone, became a matter of national concern. According to Mr. Li Langxing, responsible for the 5th District of Hubei, he told the reporter that when the bandits occupied the Pacification Zone, Commander Kang attempted to commit suicide with a gun in the basement, the bullet hitting his left shoulder. His guards quickly seized the gun. Mr. Li and Commander Kang were captured at the same time. (Mr. Li did not witness Mr. Kang's suicide attempt because they were separated by a considerable distance when captured. This was later told by Commander Kang's guards.) After being captured, Mr. Li seized an opportunity to escape from Xiangyang that night. As for Commander Kang after being captured, there were three versions of the story: (1) Some said that he died soon after being captured due to severe injuries. (2) Others said that Mr. Kang was still alive, and the bandit side was treating his wounds. (3) Still others said that after Mr. Kang was captured, the bandit side carefully treated his wounds, but Mr. Kang refused to yield and refused treatment or food, and eventually died for his country in Kanghe County, Henan. According to the broadcast of the Communist New China Radio, Kang Ze died on July 28, and based on other intelligence, to verify Mr. Kang's personality, the third version of the story is very likely. (Note: According to Fan Longxiang, director of the Political Work Department of the former Chuan-Shaanxi-Hubei Border Region Pacification Headquarters, the above information has been confirmed). The death of a national general is naturally an irreparable regret and loss for the government and the people across the country who were concerned about Mr. Kang. However, Xiangfan has after all been recovered. As long as the place where General Kang was martyred â Xiangfan â forever becomes a strong fortress for suppressing the rebellion, thereby shielding the heartland of Jianghan and Sichuan, then General Kang's sacrifice cannot be said to be without value.

Traces of Bullets Everywhere at the Old Site of the Pacification Zone

After arriving in Xiangyang, the reporter and Secretary Wang Shancheng of the Political Work Department of a certain unit stationed in Xiangyang visited the old site of the 15th Pacification Zone in the shadow of the setting sun. There were traces of bullets everywhere on the dilapidated walls, which were all symbols of the wounds inflicted by the Communist bandits on the nation. The basement, where Commander Kang unsuccessfully attempted suicide, has now become a pile of rubble. Secretary Wang told the reporter that after the Xiangfan battle ended, more than a dozen of our soldiers, carrying a machine gun, lurked in the basement. One day, when the Communist bandits were preparing to search the basement, they opened fire with their machine gun, causing many casualties to the Communist bandits, and they even spread rumors of ghosts. This is enough to prove the morale of the Communist soldiers today. These dozen or so people were safe and sound in the basement, surviving on a small amount of dry food, until they were transferred to the rear after the recovery.

The reporter had a casual conversation with Wu Chongyan, deputy division commander, and Ren Jingxiu, chief of staff, of a certain garrison division about the future defense of Xiangfan. They believed that the fall of Xiangfan was partly due to insufficient external conditions and partly due to shortcomings in personnel matters. Given the good terrain of Xiangfan, they had great confidence in the defense here. Both of them are famous generals on the battlefield. Ren had brilliant military exploits in the Que Mountain campaign in southern Henan, and Wu in the Teng County campaign in southern Shandong. During the bitter defense of Teng County last summer, Wu invented a method of using car lights to replace flares, which greatly threatened the Communist bandits' night activities. During his tenure as Chief of Staff, Chen Cheng issued an order to all troops across the country to follow his example.

Calm and Quiet Outside Xiangfan

The area outside Xiangfan is currently quite calm. North of Fancheng, twenty or thirty Chinese miles away, there are occasional small-scale skirmishes. The Communist bandits' strength is limited, and they dare not act rashly. To the west, the elite troops of the Xth Army Corps are taking Nanzhang as their core and sweeping through the mountains in three routes. The Xiangsha Road, under the maintenance of the military, is open for transportation. Regarding the defense outside Xiangfan, if we want to be absolutely safe, the best strategy is to capture Laohekou and Xinye to form a mutual support situation and shield Xiangfan. However, due to limited troops, it is difficult to talk about it for the time being. Of course, with Commander Yang Gancai's past successful experience and prestige in the Teng County, Fangcheng, and Que Mountain battles, where he won victories through large-scale bloody battles against the Communist bandits, the safety of Xiangfan is not a concern. General Yang often fishes by the Han River in his spare time, and this leisurely sentiment can set off the tranquility of northern Hubei. The scenery of Mount Longzhong and the waves of the Han River are expected to bring a refreshing change to the situation in northern Hubei with the rising autumn wind.

### The International Background of the Greek Border Conflict (Part 1)

â Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Europe, Xin Feng

The Greek issue is listed as a major case on the agenda of the Third United Nations General Assembly. This case originated from the complaint filed by the Greek government to the Security Council in December 1946. Greece believed that the banditry in its northern border was entirely instigated by its northern neighbors, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, with military assistance. However, the three countries believed that the cause of the unrest was the poor political situation of the Greek government itself and had nothing to do with the three countries. After discussion, the Security Council dispatched a commission to investigate incidents on the Greek border, composed of the eleven member countries of the Security Council, to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the four countries concerned. The Chinese representative was Ambassador Jin Wenshi, and the deputy representative was Minister Xue Guangqian. After half a year, a report was produced. The majority opinion was that the northern border of Greece was indeed supported by the three countries. It was recommended that the Security Council order the three countries to stop assisting the Greek bandits in creating disturbances, and it was also advocated that all disputes involving the four countries should be resolved by peaceful means. After two months of discussion by the Security Council, there was no result due to the Soviet Union's use of the veto power. It was submitted to the Second United Nations General Assembly held in New York in September last year for discussion. The General Assembly passed a resolution on October 21 last year to organize a United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans. On the one hand, countries sent patrolmen to patrol the northern border of Greece to see if the three countries continued to provide military assistance to the Greek bandits in creating disturbances. On the other hand, they tried their best to mediate and resolve issues such as good-neighborly relations, border agreements, refugee repatriation, and free exchange of ethnic minorities, in order to ease the strained relations between the three countries and Greece and reduce the fundamental causes of friction. The committee was originally planned to be composed of eleven countries, including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, Australia, Pakistan, and Poland. However, the Soviet Union and Poland refused to participate from the beginning. So in fact, it was composed of only nine countries. The US representative was Admiral Kirk, the US ambassador to Belgium, the UK representative was Sir Seymour, the former British ambassador to China, the Mexican representative was former Foreign Minister Gastinro, and the Dutch representative was former Navy Minister Zai Baoxian, all of whom were prominent figures of the time. The Chinese representative was Minister Xue Guangqian, and the deputy representative was Zhao Junxin. Minister Xue had been stationed in Europe for many years and had participated in the Greek investigation, so he was familiar with the matter and handled it with ease. The headquarters was established in Thessaloniki, northern Greece, in November last year, but the meeting place has recently been moved to Athens, the capital of Greece. Each country sent 40 border patrolmen, mostly from the UK and the US. China sent three people to participate: Gui Zongyao, Ji Zhiren, and Yang Fengqi. They were stationed on the borders of Greece-Albania, Greece-South, and Greece-

Bulgaria. They were in the midst of gunfire every day, risking their lives in all sorts of dangers. Once, when Gui Zongyao was patrolling the Greek-Bulgarian border, he encountered a landmine explosion, killing more than a dozen people. Mr. Gui narrowly escaped. Recently, he was hit by shrapnel on the Greek-Albanian border. It is said that the Greek government specially instructed its ambassador to China to express condolences to your Foreign Ministry. US Secretary of State Marshall also sent a special telegram to our representative Xue Guangqian, expressing his deep condolences. Last week, An Zhiren was shot by Greek bandits with machine guns when he was patrolling on a special plane, and more than a dozen bullets hit him. He barely managed to land, fortunately without causing an accident. This spring, when the Greek bandits raided Thessaloniki in the middle of the night, they fired more than 90 mortar shells into the city for two hours. One of them landed outside Minister Xue's bedroom, only two yards away. At that time, the doors and windows were destroyed, and the danger was evident. When people talk about Palestine, everyone is terrified. Little do they know that the situation in the Balkans is even more difficult and dangerous, and the chaos is even deeper than in the Jewish holy city. The committee has been established for ten months now. In addition to strengthening the confirmation of the continued support of the three countries to the Greek bandits based on the results of the patrol, there has been no progress in the mediation and resolution work because the three countries refused to cooperate with the committee. The committee first produced a general report on June 30, and then produced a supplementary report on September 10, listing the facts, conclusions, and recommendations, and submitted them to this General Assembly for discussion. Everyone knows that the Greek issue is not limited to the disputes between Greece and the three countries. The root cause is still between the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union. If the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union cannot reach an understanding, it is feared that this General Assembly discussion will be difficult to achieve results. The Greek government intends to ask the General Assembly to send international armed forces to blockade its northern border, which is more than 1,000 kilometers long. However, according to Article 43 of the United Nations Charter, the international armed forces should be placed under the Security Council. Due to the confrontation between the Soviet Union and China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, it has fallen into a stalemate and has not yet been realized. Therefore, the Greek government's wish is nothing more than drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. The international background of the Greek border will be described as follows for reference.

The Geographical Situation of the Northern Border of Greece

It is almost impossible to study the relationship between Greece and its northern neighbors, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, before understanding their geographical situation. The northern border of Greece stretches for about 840 miles from Albania through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Generally speaking, the border area, except for the eastern section of the Greek-Bulgarian border, is a mountainous area. Greece is geographically a corner of the Balkan Peninsula and also a piece of land in the Mediterranean. The terrain of the Balkans is rugged, with undulating hills. In the area where Greece borders its three northern neighbors, countless valleys are separated among them. There are only a few places where roads can pass. There is no major road from Albania to Greece, only one road from Albania to the center of the Balkan Peninsula, and finally to Thessaloniki and Istanbul. In addition, there are several passages in Sarantoporos and other places on the Albanian-Greek border. The border between Greece and Yugoslavia has an international passage that runs from southern Belgrade through Nish and Skoplje, along the Morava and Vardar rivers, through Gevgeli to Thessaloniki. The other minor passes on the southern border of Greece are mainly some routes in the Beles region. The main passage on the border between Greece and Bulgaria runs south from Sofia through Greek territory to Adrianople in Turkey. There are also several minor passages. Historically, Greece has been invaded by enemies from the north, south, east, and west. Because Greece is located half on land and half on the sea, it is not only threatened by the north on land, but also attacked by sea because its people must rely on the sea for their livelihood.

For centuries, the geographical location of the northern border of Greece has not changed, but the importance of its situation has changed with the times. Especially after the Second World War (1947 to 1948), as a result of the confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, Greece was the first to bear the brunt. Because of its increasingly complex relationship with its three northern neighbors, the current situation on the northern border of Greece can be outlined in the memorandum submitted by the Greek government to the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans on December 8 last year:

"The borders of Greece with Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have now been completely abandoned. For a year and a half, the Greek border guards have been attacked from time to time, and countless defending soldiers have been killed and captured.

They bloomed yesterday, with red and white colors interspersed, bright and lovely, attracting many viewers.

### Salted Duck in Southern Anhui

â Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Yu Ningpo

[Dispatch from Huizhou, This Newspaper, 3rd of the Month] At a time when there is a chicken and egg panic in the Jiangnan area, it may be welcome by readers to have the reporter report on the salted duck in southern Anhui. Salted duck, also known as salted duck, has always been a famous product of Nanjing, followed by Wuhu in southern Anhui. In fact, the source of Nanjing salted duck, in addition to some from Gaochun and Liuhe, is mostly purchased from Wuhu, Xuancheng, Hefei, and other places. Wuhu is particularly rich in duck production due to the Qingyi River and Chaohu streams. In the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, the annual output of raw ducks was always more than four million. The sales of salted ducks in Wuhu market were about one million per year. After the 19th year of the Republic of China, although the market in Nanjing and Wuhu was not prosperous, the consumption of salted ducks still maintained a large part of the original sales, remaining strong and unyielding.

Production and Sales

The origin of raw ducks is quite wide, with two types: domestic ducks and wild ducks. Domestic ducks are hatched by farmers themselves, while wild ducks are produced in the reeds of rivers and lakes. Gaochun, Liuhe, Gaoyou and other places in Jiangsu Province are rich in raw ducks, and farmers also raise a lot of them. Farmers in Wuhu, Xuancheng, Dangtu, Datong, Guichi, Hefei and other places in southern Anhui raise even more ducks than in Jiangsu Province. The Qingyi River in the south and the Chaohu Lake and Heyuezhou in Datong in the center are particularly rich in wild duck production. Every year from September to January of the following year, during these five months, it is the time when fat ducks are on the market. Merchants from Nanjing and Wuhu duck shops come to the production areas to buy from duck vendors, because direct transactions are fairer in price.

The annual output of raw ducks in southern and central Anhui is three to four million. There are more than 100 duck shops in Nanjing, most of which are opened by Muslims. The annual sales are from two million to one million five to six hundred thousand. The sales of ducks in Wuhu market are not as good as in Nanjing, because the capital has a larger population and more travelers, so the sales of salted ducks will still be guaranteed in the future.

Production

Salted duck production mostly uses fat, raw ducks, and diseased or dead ducks are discarded. The brine for marinating ducks is better the older it is. This brine is the essence juice boiled with salt, and the taste of ducks boiled with fresh brine is worse.

The method is to slaughter the duck, remove the large and small feathers, cut a small hole under the wings, take out the internal organs, wash the inside of the duck's abdomen, so that no blood remains inside, then stuff salt into the abdomen and smear it all over the body. Each duck must use four taels of salt. After about 24 hours, the salt water turns into blood water. Then pour out the salt water in the abdomen, soak it in the old brine for about 12 hours, take it out and hang it on a hook, wait for the wind to dry the moisture, and it becomes the famous product of salted duck.

The period for making salted duck is most suitable in the months after autumn and before spring. After the spring is warm, the duck shops will stop making it. If there is a need, they will also engage in production, and the procedure is still the same, but the time for marinating in the old brine should be shortened, because the weather is warm and the salty taste is easily absorbed. In spring and autumn, the marinating time should be 12 hours, and in summer, it only needs 3 hours.

Cooking Method

Salted duck is a famous product of Jiangnan, so people who live in Nanjing and Wuhu, or travelers passing by, always buy a few salted ducks when they return to their hometown to give to relatives and friends. When the Jianglun approaches the Nanjing and Wuhu docks, the small stalls selling salted ducks rush to the ship to sell. The passengers on the ship also buy one or two of this delicacy to add to their meals and drink with wine.

If the cooking method of salted duck is not proper, the taste will naturally be unpleasant. The best cooking method is to boil the water, then put the duck in, then add 20% pure water, cover the pot with a lid, preferably a small lid, so that the duck does not float on the surface of the water, and at the same time turn off the stove fire. After about 50 minutes or an hour, boil the water in the pot with the duck until it is 80% cooked (until small bubbles are found), take the duck out, pour out the accumulated water in the abdomen, put it back in the pot, and cook it with a little cold water over a low fire for about an hour. The taste will naturally be extremely delicious.

### Announced Yesterday by the Superintendent's Office: No Shortage of Industrial Raw Materials

[Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Superintendent's Office takes increasing production as a matter of utmost urgency, so it pays special attention to investigating the inventory of raw materials in the city. It is now learned that the industry has compiled a detailed list of the required amount of 15 major raw materials and sent it to the Materials Adjustment Committee of the Superintendent's Office for reference. According to the office, the inventory of diesel and gasoline among the various industrial raw materials can last for four months. For cotton, a large amount of US-aided cotton has been shipped and has begun to be distributed, so there is no worry of shortage in two or three months. Since raw cotton is supplied, there is no problem with cotton yarn. Yongli Company and Taiwan can fully supply both caustic soda and purified alkali. For Chilean nitrate, the Central Bank has a large storage in the past and can supply the market demand as much as possible. As for the supply and demand situation of dyes, according to the estimate of the Dyeing Industry Association, the monthly demand is 450,000 pounds, and the China Trust Bureau currently has a storage of 1.8 million pounds, which is enough for four months. For alum, there are regulations in the import quota, so the source is not lacking. In addition, shipping companies usually sell a large amount of raw materials such as factory iron, which can meet the needs of the market. So in fact, the raw material problem is not as serious as expected.

### Cotton Yarn Market Stagnation: Yarn Merchants Plan Joint Distribution

Cotton Yarn Business Association Director Tang Zhiliang yesterday met with Supervisor Jiang, requesting early approval of the business scope of yarn merchants and offering advice on the establishment of a joint cotton yarn distribution center. His reasoning was based on the following three points:

(1) After trading in the cotton yarn market ceased, among all member yarn firms, only retailers still intended to hold inventory for business. However, once the inventory is sold out, they will also face the same stagnation. Regarding their business scope, they request early approval to maintain their livelihood.

(2) Cotton yarn wholesalers, who promote yarn mill products as far as Southeast Asia and the Near East to meet the needs of handicrafts in various cities and towns, propose that yarn mill products, in addition to direct distribution to local replicating industries, be distributed by all yarn merchants through a jointly organized distribution center, dividing into two groups: local retailers and domestic and foreign bulk distributors, defining their business scope. As for how to allocate, a detailed plan will be submitted for approval after the principles are decided. If this plan is feasible, yarn merchants can have fixed business after the market stops, and the supply and demand of cotton yarn in local and foreign regions can also tend towards normalcy.

(3) The yarn industry directly and indirectly employs tens of thousands of people. If yarn merchants' businesses are not allowed to continue, it will increase unemployment and affect society.

Production Estimate

According to information recently obtained from the Materials Adjustment Committee: Regarding the export of yarn and cloth from this city, after a decision was made in a previous meeting to conduct planned exports based on actual production and consumption, preliminary estimates of the production and consumption quantities have been completed. The total monthly output of all factories in this city is estimated to be over 90,000 pieces. After supplying the city's monthly need of about 50,000 pieces, 20,000 pieces will be exported to foreign countries to exchange for raw cotton, and 20,000 pieces will be sold to the inland.

According to Deputy Director Li Lixia of the committee, who told reporters yesterday morning, there is no fear of a yarn and cloth supply shortage at present, as the number of working spindles in factories across the country is approximately 4.4 million or more, only about 20% less than before the war, while the purchasing power of the general public is more than 20% lower than before the war. As for the supply of raw cotton, the authorities are also making every effort to find a solution. It is estimated that 60% of the raw cotton needed nationwide in the future can be supplied domestically, and the remaining 40% will be exchanged from foreign countries.

Central Textile Distribution

The cotton yarn and cotton cloth markets in this city remain closed. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company, as usual, opened up distribution of eight types of yarn. Among them, 40-count TK Sunlight brand yarn was limited to clothing industry purchases; 40 and 60-count Sunlight were limited to handkerchief industry purchases; 10-count doubled yarn was limited to canvas industry purchases; and 16-count coarse yarn was limited to towel industry purchases. As for 20-count yarn, distribution was temporarily suspended because the Central Bank and the General Administration had not delivered the goods.

Also, due to the monetary authority's control of materials, both the yarn and cloth markets have stopped gathering, causing replicating manufacturers in other areas to have no place to purchase raw materials. They had previously applied to the Textile Construction Company, seeking to enjoy the same distribution and purchase rights as manufacturers in this city. This matter has now been satisfactorily resolved, and they will be approved for distribution in the next round.

The cotton cloth market continues to be closed. The cloth industry association still represents the dyeing and weaving industry association in handling the second round of cloth distribution, distributing more than 25,000 bolts of assorted colored cloth. All member retail cloth stores of the association can apply for purchase. In addition, it is supplying more than 40,000 bolts of cloth on behalf of private dyeing factories, limited to member purchases.

The trend of panic buying has been prevalent in the market recently. Flying Wheel thread is still being supplied as much as possible. It is said that the foreign exchange earned from sales in Southeast Asia and India is exchanged with Textile Construction for cotton yarn, so the raw materials for thread making are not lacking.

Quiet Cotton Market

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was quiet, with a slight turning point. Various grades of coarse and fine cotton linters were still not traded, people were quiet, and the market atmosphere was still cold. Zhoupu seed cotton was traded slightly, as scheduled.

### Cotton Cloth Industry Notice to Members: No Early Closing

The Cotton Cloth Industry Association recently stated that, as citizens' panic buying of cotton cloth is intensifying, especially for the cotton cloth industry, most cotton cloth retail stores are closing early, causing panic in the market and greatly affecting people's minds. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to all members to prioritize the country and the nation, act cautiously, and comply with the prescribed hours: (1) Monday to Saturday, from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (2) Sundays from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

### Stable Silk Market

Yesterday, the market sentiment for rayon silk was slightly calmer, with sporadic transactions. Local retail sales were still brisk, but Japanese goods in various grades were out of stock, and Italian goods of various brands were also slow to sell. Association distribution continued as usual. Due to the high price of raw silk, many buyers were watching and waiting. The silk weaving industry was also weak due to the cost of silk materials exceeding the cost of finished products, and their purchasing appetite was very low.

Local sales of silk satin remained brisk, but most were female-oriented and floral-patterned goods that were frequently snapped up. Winter menswear goods were also in demand. The supply and sale of quilt covers from factories was scarce, and interest was also weak, resulting in a sluggish market.

### Statistics on Sales of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, a total of 18,500 gold yuan of state-owned enterprise stocks were sold, bringing the total to 4,037,400 gold yuan before transportation. The sales figures for each type of stock are as follows: Textile Construction 2,861,000 yuan, China Merchants 45,500 yuan, Taiwan Sugar 1,035,200 yuan, Combined Paper 91,700 yuan, Tianjin Paper 4,000 yuan.

### Measures for Insurance Industry Capital Increase Still Awaiting Approval

[Our Newspaper] Amidst the wave of capital increases in the banking industry, there are rumors that the financial authorities are also actively drafting measures for capital increases in the insurance industry, and there is talk of stipulating that the minimum capital of each insurance company be 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, the reporter inquired with Director Lin of the Financial Control Bureau about the Ministry of Finance's handling of the capital increase for this industry. Director Lin replied: Regarding the measures for the capital increase of the insurance industry, no order has yet been received from the Ministry, and it is still awaiting approval.

However, according to the views of leading figures in the insurance industry here, the capital increase of the insurance industry is clearly different from that of the banking industry. The financial authorities' management of the insurance industry should focus on the industry's retained premium and reinsurance amount, while the amount of capital is actually a secondary issue.

It is reported that the insurance industry's opinion is that a more appropriate minimum capital for each company would be 100,000 yuan after the capital increase. If the minimum capital requirement is too high, it will reduce investment in the insurance industry, further reducing insurance companies, resulting in only a few remaining insurance companies unable to bear huge insurance amounts, and massive reinsurance abroad, which would only harm the country's foreign exchange. Therefore, they believe that the financial authorities can use this capital increase opportunity to formulate a reasonable capital increase amount, while carefully paying attention to the retained premium and reinsurance amount of the industry, which would more easily promote the development of China's insurance industry.

### Legal Tender Used as Papermaking Raw Material

[Our Newspaper] Since the issuance of the gold yuan, a large amount of old legal tender has been collected, estimated to be over 100 trillion. The Central Bank's treasury has made a decision on how to handle this legal tender. That is, in all collection areas where there are paper mills, the legal tender will be purchased by the paper mills as papermaking raw material. If the paper mill is too far away and the purchase price offered by the paper mill is not enough to cover the freight costs, then it will be destroyed. As for the huge amount of legal tender collected in this city, it will be sold to paper mills by auction once it has been sorted out.

### First Allocation of American Cotton Totaling Approximately 70,000 Bales

According to the United American Aid Cotton Yarn and Cloth Joint Operating Office: The total amount of American aid cotton is expected to be more than 300,000 bales (500 pounds per bale), which will be allocated in three or four installments depending on the arrival of each batch. The first allocation is 69,518 bales.

The proportional standard for the first allocation is based on the American aid cotton allocation principle, which should be allocated in proportion to the number of working spindles in domestic textile factories. The proportion for the first allocation is based on the current total number of 4,419,452 working spindles in national and private yarn mills, with each working spindle receiving approximately 0.0157 bales of American aid cotton (calculated as a percentage, state-owned yarn mills account for 40.07%, private yarn mills account for 58.2%, and foreign-owned yarn mills account for 1%).

The first allocation of American cotton is divided into 31 types according to length and grade. There are approximately 230 yarn mills receiving the allocation, and the types of yarn and cloth converted are numerous. Therefore, the procedures are quite cumbersome under the conditions of fair and cautious error prevention.

Since the work began in mid-September, as of now, 87 yarn mills that have submitted formal applications have been signed and delivery orders have been issued. In addition to approximately 10,000 bales allocated from Tianjin and Qingdao, according to reports from warehouses in Shanghai, more than 6,000 bales of Sichuan cotton have been issued. In recent days, manufacturers who have received delivery orders are being urged to pick them up.

[Our Newspaper] At the fourth meeting of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee the other day, after passing the cases of comprehensive joint purchasing and expanding the joint purchasing fund to 150 million yuan, Committee Member Li Lixia has now brought the cases to Beijing last night so that they can be submitted to today's Executive Yuan regular meeting for approval and implementation.

### Less Than 50 Bushels Arrived: Rice Market Almost Completely Shut Down, Flour Mills' Raw Material Source Exhausted

Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving was less than 50 bushels, only 43 bushels, which can be said to have disappeared. All 43 bushels were delivered to the South Market, including 8 bushels of white japonica, 25 bushels of thin indica, and 10 bushels of milled indica, all sold at the limited price. This tiny amount can be said to be a drop in the ocean, so trading can be said to have not taken place. The North Market had no deliveries at all, so trading was completely stopped. The industry all closed early.

Flour

Trading has not started, as before. Not only has the market stopped, but the raw material wheat for Japanese factories has also been exhausted. Future production is a major concern.

Miscellaneous Grains

Trading has entered its final stage. Soybean transactions are few and far between, with only 20-30 bags of Poyang seed beans and about 50-60 bags of winter beans traded, all acquired by local merchants who were quick on their feet. Sesame supply has decreased, and the market is firm. More than 100 bags of raw peanuts from Xuzhou were offered. No other grains were offered.

Edible Oil

Transactions are infrequent. Yesterday, the China Grease Company distributed 250 barrels of old-barrel cooked vegetable oil, each barrel containing 375 catties, priced at 43.3 yuan. Each retailer received one barrel. Also, manufacturers had planned to distribute soybean oil and vegetable oil through a joint sale yesterday morning, upon presentation of the market permit to the designated manufacturers, but the China Vegetation Factory portion was not distributed. There were still no soybean cake transactions.

### Stable and Brisk Tea Market

Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, although the buying interest from exporters was like bamboo shoots after the rain, growing rapidly without restraint, sellers still believed that goods from the producing areas were scarce and prices were high. Therefore, they were unwilling to easily let go of the goods in their hands. As a result of negotiations between the two sides, the situation mostly remained in a stalemate. The process, after being silent for a long time, has not yet recovered, but the market atmosphere is extraordinarily stable and brisk. As for domestic sales of tea, there is also more demand than supply, and prices are firm.

### Sugar Prices Hover

The sugar market was stable yesterday, with sentiment firm but slightly soft, and prices hovering. Trading within the market was slow. Sellers were unwilling to sell, and buyers' purchasing appetite was also very limited. The market closed with a slight improvement. The 22nd issue of granulated white sugar warehouse receipts was not traded. Medium sugar and local factory white sugar rose slightly by one or two jiao. Trading in No. 45 car white refined sugar was very cold, with no change in price. Xinghua high white sugar retreated slightly, while tenth sugar was dull and trading was sparse. The rest remained unchanged.

### Last Week's Export Settlement Reduced by Half Compared to Previous Week

### What Are We Waiting For?

-- Wu Yong

In a short essay titled "Waiting," R. L. Evans said something to the effect that many people are waiting, not really knowing what they are waiting for, but still inexplicably waiting, and life quietly passes by in the waiting. A father longs to spend more time with his son when he has more free time; a mother genuinely wants to pay more attention to her daughter's affairs; but while waiting for the opportunity, time waits for no one, and the daughter gets married and the son establishes his own family and moves away. Some people are constantly thinking of breaking bad habits and constantly thinking of having more contact with friends. But when will they put it into practice? People seem to forget that daily life is our life. So-called life refers to the era we live in, the day we are going through, and every hour. Whether we are disappointed or bored, this is our life. The author ends by asking: What are we waiting for?

What are we waiting for? Speaking personally, I feel quite lost.

In searching for that short essay, I found three similar essays in American magazines, which shows how much this idea is valued in America. I haven't read many books, but after searching my mind, I found that there is no such idea in Chinese philosophy. Zhuangzi advocates the merging of self with others and all things, and does not encourage people to value the future, but at the same time he also tells you not to value the present; Yang Zhu said something like "Enjoy the present, why worry about the afterlife," which seems a bit like it on the surface, but its real meaning is to tell you to passively enjoy life in a timely manner, not to actively focus on the present. The ancient poem: "Life is not as long as a hundred years, but often worries about a thousand years," also focuses on the negative. This idea does not seem to have been encountered in Confucianism, and it is even less likely to be found in Buddhism. Is the reason why it doesn't exist because it is too ordinary? This is beyond my knowledge.

The focus of our traditional thinking is to overestimate the future, such as "thrift," such as "diligence," such as "looking ahead," such as "foresight," all of which are centered on the future. Generally, the reason why Americans are diligent is that their goal is not thrift. If their goal is the word "thrift," why bother being diligent? As for the Bible's saying "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself," old gentlemen immersed in traditional thinking might even regard it as heresy. But the strange thing is: the more you worry about the "future," the more you risk losing the "present." Because you value the unknowable future, you lose your own center of gravity, which is to lose yourself.

A person's life is ultimately made up of many "todays"; a country's destiny is ultimately formed by a majority of "individuals." If the whole country is just waiting for the future and ignoring the present, the fate of a country composed of people who have lost their center of gravity can be imagined. But in fact, many of us have indeed lost our center of gravity. These people are really extremely kind people. These people are happy when they hear that American loans are promising, and worried when American loans are hopeless. When they hear that someone is going abroad, they turn around to inquire whether the news is true, looking panicked, as if everything depends on this one move; if they find out that someone is just spending foreign exchange, they immediately sigh, thinking that everything is over from now on; when they learn that he is indeed going for a loan, they suddenly place great expectations on him again. With so many rumors in this city, if a person focuses on how so-and-so will be, he can spend the whole day neglecting his own business and still be busy. In fact, "things must happen, and principles must be followed," and any truly important thing in the future can be accurately inferred from the past, so why give it unnecessary expectations? What is important is you today.

Otherwise, since the Republic of China, first there were several years of "extraordinary times," followed by eight years of the "War of Resistance period," and now it is the "Suppression of Rebellion period." We must wait for the arrival of a normal period of peace. We may grow old and accomplish nothing. What's more, if we look through history, we know that the world has never been normal.

Therefore, we might as well change Yang Zhu's words and use them as our motto: "Care about today, why worry about tomorrow!"

### Metaphor

-- Cong Zhi

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman held a press conference, expressing the hope to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union.

A female reporter interrupted him. She asked, "Since the two countries cannot coordinate politically, is a friendly trade relationship possible?"

Harriman replied: Miss, your family buys groceries from the catering company every day, but you may not be willing to marry the owner of that catering company, right? However, as long as his dishes are indeed very good, I think you will definitely still be happy to be his customer, and have a pretty good relationship.

### First Trip to Shanghai

-- Le Zhi

As someone who has just arrived in Shanghai, I will briefly describe my impressions as follows. I don't know how those who have lived here for a long time feel.

The general phenomenon in Shanghai is complexity, richness, disorder, and contradiction, which is elusive everywhere. This is due to a city's gradual development over a hundred years, and there are innate factors that cannot be helped. The congestion on Nanjing Road is the most obvious example. Shanghai seems to be exclusively for people with the highest level of life, who can transcend the general reality and enjoy themselves. Secondly, it is also for people with the lowest level of life, who can sacrifice any real constraints and eke out a living. The average middle class people are the most helpless. They cannot afford to live in a house, but they cannot spend the night by the roadside. They are the target of all public laws. They have to bear burdens and obey, but their welfare needs a lot of effort. To give an example, there are few or no public toilets for men and women on the streets. Even if there are, no one knows where they are. This is also difficult to ask people about. High-class people sit in cars, hotels, tea rooms, and familiar places, where they can find a solution easily, and the lowest-class people can ignore everything, but ordinary people want to solve the problem casually, but it is not allowed by etiquette and law. To be honest, this matter is not a small problem in Shanghai now. If you look at the traces on the side of the road a little bit more remote, you have to say it is a kind of humiliation. The root cause is that the distribution of public toilets for men and women is not average enough, and there are no clear instructions. In fact, the structure of public toilets may as well be as simple as possible, and the number of places must be greatly increased. You must know that many low-class families do not even have this convenience at home, and they all rely on public toilets.

In the past, foreigners managed the concession without considering the convenience of Chinese people. There were no street names on the house numbers, and the roads were too long. Often, when getting off the bus halfway, one had no idea where one was. There are a few things that are extremely easy to do, why not do them? The beginning and end points of each road should be clearly marked on the street signs as the east entrance or the west entrance, the south entrance or the north entrance. On too long roads, a sign should be erected in sections to indicate the house numbers from a certain intersection to a certain intersection. The tram station should indicate where the tram is waiting. Public vehicles should paint the route they pass on the body of the vehicle. (Shanghai's terrain has the Huangpu River, Suzhou River, and Racecourse as standards. You only need to draw a simplified map to symbolize the places you pass.) The times of the last bus on each route of public vehicles are different, and they should also be explained separately. In addition, we have seen the signs of postal vehicles, but there is no explanation of the time, so how can people who are not familiar with the situation know what time to wait for the postal vehicle? Things like this are inevitably convenient but cannot be completely thorough.

Shanghai's place names have the confusion of new intersections and old road names, plus the difference between what is said verbally and what is written on paper. They all show its complexity and disorder, so it seems that the facilities for indicating routes still need to be increased.

### Hemp on the Wall

-- Jia Tianjian

Living upstairs, there is no inch of land to plant autumn flowers. On the low wall under the terrace, wild hemp grows short and long; How much soil is there around the roots? Watering only relies on rain and dew. Rain is uncertain, and nourishment cannot be lacking. How can it also grow? Autumn flowers take the place of spring! Fire-colored flowers bloom every year, shaking brilliantly like a haze in September. I have lived in this building for nearly eight years, and this hemp is more than last year; Last year there were only two or three sparse branches, but this year there is a dense clump growing vigorously. Passers-by point and laugh, asking in surprise, I have nothing to answer, how can I boast? If the original vitality is truly abundant, and the nourishment is not trivial, then a breath of air can connect with heaven and earth, regardless of rain, water, or soil? Who believes in this principle? Viewers only sigh in silence! The owner hates dust and can use it to block one side; The owner loves autumn colors and can draw small golden cars from the flowers. An extraordinary sight that is dazzling and pleasing to the eye, why bother going to Tao Yuanming's home with wine!

### The Queen of the Netherlands

-- Chen Xiang

Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands abdicated in early September of this year. This 67-year-old lady took office on August 31, 1898, her 18th birthday, and has been in power for half a century.

Wilhelmina is the eleventh monarch of the House of Orange. Her father, William III, was 63 years old when she was born, and she was the only person to inherit the throne. However, her mother, Emma, was only 20 years old at the time and was William III's second wife. When William III died, Wilhelmina was only ten years old and was ruled by her mother for eight years before formally ascending the throne.

Wilhelmina is simple and frugal. She lives in a simple white palace on a bustling street in The Hague. This palace even has a house number like other houses - number 68. Inside, there are only stoves and no radiators. When the Queen wants to take a bath, the water has to be carried bucket by bucket temporarily. She also rides a bicycle like ordinary people, and the bicycle is usually parked on a rack near the palace gate. She also takes time to manage household affairs. Before World War II, people could often see her sitting at the window sewing.

The newly appointed Princess Juliana is the only daughter of the Queen and Prince Henry of Mecklenburg. She was born in 1909 and is now a 38-year-old middle-aged woman. The Queen felt that her childhood was too restricted, bleak, and lifeless, so she raised Juliana in a more normal way. She allowed her to study at schools outside the palace and play with other children. Therefore, Juliana has many friends and freely mingles with commoners without restraint. It is said that this new Dutch monarch not only inherited her mother's simple style, but will also be closer to the common people.

The current semester has begun, and I planned to withdraw money as agreed to cover tuition and other expenses. Unexpectedly, the bank still used the pre-war deposit repayment method, only allowing a one-time settlement, paying only a little over two corners. May I ask, twelve years ago, I deposited the price of 30 shi of white rice, but today I only receive one liter of rice, which is not enough to buy a book. Is there such a principle in the world? The government advocates frugality and rewards deposits for children's education. Parents who educate their children and save materials for the country should not allow banks to exploit and enrich themselves. In terms of the capital of various banks, what was the total value more than ten years ago? What is the current value? Even if we ignore real estate, the amount of foreign exchange recently paid by various banks to the national treasury has exceeded the value. I believe there must be many depositors in the same situation as me. I hope the government authorities will re-establish reasonable measures and order various banks to pay as agreed to maintain credit. Reader Li Shiyong

### Mark Twain's Love Letter

-- Zhang Ruxian

The famous American writer Mark Twain can be regarded as the most diligent writer of love letters. After he and Mrs. Livy got married, they still wrote letters frequently. When he was away from home, he would send her a letter almost every day, sometimes four letters a day. Even when he was at home, he would still write to her, often putting short notes on her breakfast plate or stuffing them in her hand. The following letter was written on November 27, 1885, which was Mrs. Livy's 40th birthday and their 17th wedding anniversary. He used the morning as a metaphor for youth, and the green valleys and fields as a metaphor for the happy days of youth. Look, it's simply a beautiful poem:

"Dear, here we are at another milestone, far from where we started. But when we look back, there is a pleasant scenery - in our pleasant memories, everything in that distant morning is still the same, the slopes are still lush green, the fields are still full of flowers, and the mountains are still silent. We still have many companions on this journey - ah, such precious, lovely, gentle companions who inspire my ambition! They make us forget the difficulties of the journey. You and I are both heading towards the sunset, and they accompany us, holding our hands, so that our feet do not feel tired. Everyone is together, only becoming more and more loving. Everyone walks towards the flower-filled green fields ahead, the light of dusk shines behind the fields and flowers, as lovely as that gentle morning of the past."

### Remembering Zhao Shuru

-- Chen Zuogao

I previously wrote about the anecdotes of Wu Changshuo. Thinking of Mr. Zhao Shuru of Siming, who was also proficient in epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting, the two of them shone in the art world one after the other. Some of the old words and deeds are worth passing on, so I will write them down to continue the previous discussion. Mr. Zhao's given name was Shiwang, and his courtesy name was Weichang. Later, he changed his courtesy name to Shuru. He collected two crossbow machines from the Shu Han Dynasty, Wei Wu's Jianxing era, and treasures such as Shuzhong, all of which are rare treasures. Therefore, he named his study Er Nu Jing She, and later changed his name to Er Nu Laoren. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he was an official in Fujian, serving as the Assistant Magistrate and colleague with my father. His calligraphy was proficient in all four scripts, and his painting was excellent in feathers, flowers, grass, and insects. His horses were especially well-known. His father, Cuifu (named Youchen, a well-known calligrapher in the late Qing Dynasty, who had many famous scholars as his disciples, such as Wu Dacheng and Tan Zhonglin), once served as the Magistrate of Zhenjiang. When Mr. Zhao was only eight years old, he would paint for guests, with a calm demeanor. His Eight Horses were lifelike, embodying the beauty of "Meng Ni Min E Zhi Man Gui Xian Qie Pei." One day, Lin Ouzhai (named Shoutu, Provincial Treasurer of Hubei), went to Cuifu's banquet, saw his work, and was greatly surprised, calling him a child prodigy and marrying his daughter to him. After that, Mr. Zhao became more devoted to Lang Shining's paintings during the Qianlong period, studying the posture, demeanor, and expression of horses day and night for decades.

Mr. Zhao's seal carving imitated Zhao Zhiqian, and he gained the essence of it. The side inscriptions were simple and dignified, almost surpassing him. However, his whole life's energy was focused on art, and he had no time to engage in the ordering of words and sounds and giant works. In the early Republic of China, Cheng Linsheng collected a wealth of bronze vessels and artifacts from the Three Dynasties, and asked Mr. Zhao to organize them one by one and attach explanations. As a result, he made many discoveries in the comparison of similarities and differences, which can continue the work of Ruan Yuan's Ji Gu Zhai and Zhang Jin's Qing Yi Ge. It is said that although Mr. Zhao was only an engraver, he could be ranked among the epigraphers.

After the Xinhai Revolution, he once worked in the Jiangxi Tax Bureau and settled in Shanghai, moving his residence three times. He first rented a house on Tangshan Road. The senior calligrapher Zeng Nongran, who was living nearby at the time, often came with paintings to ask for comments. Later, he moved to West Jiaxing Road, next to a pig slaughterhouse, with a manure pier in front of the door. Strange noises were heard all day long, and the stench filled the air. People all covered their ears and noses and passed by, but Mr. Zhao lived there peacefully for seven or eight years. Before the War of Resistance, he moved to Weihaiwei Road, and Zuo Gao often went to visit him, seeing that he was tall and vigorous, holding a cigar, with smoke rising. The beard had only a dozen strands, comparable to Wu Changshuo. When carving stone seals, his arms and wrists were in the air. He often told his disciples, "Take the highest standard as your model, and you will only get the middle one." He was usually taciturn and never criticized people. Even close indoor disciples were treated with the courtesy of guests. Besides going out to watch movies and plays, he had no other hobbies, sweeping away the habits of a celebrity.

Looking back, since Mr. Zhao traveled as an official in Fujian, he had seen many fine stone seals and became determined to imitate them. In the catalogues of seals from the Qin and Han dynasties, he painstakingly copied every character with a different form, following the example of the Han Dynasty's classification of rhymes, with the number of characters about three times wider. After that, he wrote three or four drafts but did not finish them, so he asked his brother Julai to continue it, naming it "Ancient Seal Character Rhyme Forest." In the year of Bingyin, Mr. Luo Zhenyu from Shangyu visited Shanghai, and Mr. Zhao went to his door with the book to beg for a preface. More than two years later, the preface had not been published and was returned as it was. Later, Luo Zifu Yi also had "A Compilation of Qin and Han Characters" published. However, the manuscript of the Rhyme Forest was voluminous and had not been printed, and it is still stored in the home of the seal collector Zhang Luchang. Holding a pen to this point, I occasionally check the Two Nujing House Seal Collection on the desk, and I can't help but feel a sense of the loss of a dear friend.

### Calling for Children's Education Savings - Hoping the Government Will Revise Reasonable Measures

I read the news in the Nanjing dispatch of your newspaper on September 22, "Xu Huqing and other representatives of pre-war bank depositors in the capital petitioned the Legislative Yuan for children's education savings." As one of these depositors, I have some thoughts. Twelve years ago, I saved money and food to open an account for my young son in a bank in Jiangsu Province, depositing 280 yuan of national currency for secondary school education savings. This year, it is due to expire. According to the bank's regulations, 100 yuan will be withdrawn each semester as tuition, food, and book expenses, with twelve installments for six years of secondary school. We should encourage savings. Depositors educate their children and save materials for the country. We should not allow banks to exploit and enrich themselves. In terms of the capital of various banks, what was the total value a little over ten years ago? What is the current value? Even if we ignore real estate, the amount of foreign exchange recently paid by various banks to the national treasury has exceeded the value. I believe there must be many depositors in the same situation as me. I hope the government authorities will re-establish reasonable measures and order various banks to pay as agreed to maintain credit. Reader Li Shiyong
