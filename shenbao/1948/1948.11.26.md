[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 25th] The situation on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway is developing. The northward troops are still stalled near Xisipo. The battle for Lingbi remains intense.

One of the villages, named Liujiatun, was rumored to be the headquarters of Chen's Third Column, and it was also hit and destroyed. After 3 p.m., the air force continued to sortie, conducting extensive bombing of bandits who had infiltrated between Suxian and Lingbi.

### US Leaders Discuss Aid to China: Statement to be Issued Upon Decision; Secretary Marshall's Style is Consistent: Taciturn; President Truman Expresses Great Sympathy for Ambassador Koo's Appeal for Assistance

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] Truman, Marshall, and senior U.S. defense officials have been discussing since the 22nd whether it is possible to provide more assistance to the Chinese government, which is currently in distress. It was learned here tonight that the meeting of these senior officials to discuss the China issue has not yet ended. As soon as they reach a final decision, the United States will issue a formal statement on its policy toward China. Marshall met with Truman for 25 minutes today, and it is generally believed that their conversation concerned the China issue. However, Marshall maintained his consistent style and remained silent on the matter. The National Security Council, which is responsible for formulating U.S. defense strategy and foreign policy, also held an important meeting at the White House last night, but the content of the meeting is unknown. What actions the United States will take to aid the Chinese government in the future is a matter of great concern and speculation. Both the extreme factions advocating full-scale aid to China and those advocating a hands-off approach have a large number of supporters and are arguing endlessly, but the attitude of U.S. government officials remains secret.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] When Marshall met with reporters on the afternoon of the 24th, he made a brief verbal statement on the situation in China, but did not explain what policy the United States would adopt in the current crisis, nor did he specifically mention what kind of assistance would be given to the Chinese government. When Marshall began to discuss the situation in China, he emphasized that one of the major problems facing the United States was what appropriate measures the United States could take in the current crisis to truly help overcome the difficulties. Marshall continued, saying that when considering this matter, it must be clearly remembered under what conditions the United States could take action, which was related to the actions of Congress. He also specifically mentioned the question of whether there were available resources and materials, and the question of the United States getting involved in the Chinese vortex. He declared that this was a very difficult problem that needed to be carefully considered. Marshall then reviewed the $400 million military and economic aid plan for China passed in April, saying that a considerable amount of the $125 million military grant consisted of airplanes, gasoline, and other military supplies, most of which were equipment. Referring to the problem of available supplies and materials in the United States, he said, "We are making every effort to expedite action, using naval vessels and merchant ships to transport materials to China." At this point, Marshall suddenly ended his remarks on China, saying, "I have said all I intend to say this afternoon about the situation in China." At today's press conference, which was attended by an unprecedented number of reporters, the Chinese crisis was the issue of greatest concern to the audience, but reporters still did not learn any specific expressions of U.S. attitude from Marshall. When reporters asked Marshall whether the China issue could be clarified in the next few days, he replied that he did not intend to comment on it. One reporter, dissatisfied with Marshall's reserved attitude, asked him, "Does the United States have no policy toward China?" Marshall replied, "No comment." Another reporter asked Marshall whether the State Department would recommend to the next Congress that aid to China be increased, and Marshall gave the same empty reply. Marshall seemed extremely unwilling to discuss the situation in China today. It is evident that since Monday, Marshall, Truman, and other government officials have not reached any clear conclusions in their discussions on the situation in China. Before a final decision is made, neither the White House nor the State Department intends to issue any formal statement.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] Our Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi Kyuin, continued today to ask President Truman to immediately provide our country with more material and moral support as we engage in a war to resist communism. After meeting with President Truman, the Ambassador told reporters that he was extremely excited after his meeting with the President, and that the President expressed "great sympathy" for our country. However, when reporters asked why he was so excited, the Ambassador did not explain. Koo said that in his meeting with the President, he had emphasized the urgent need for aid to China. When reporters asked whether he had discussed the issue of the United States sending a military delegation to China, the Ambassador reiterated that he had emphasized the urgency of our country's needs, the seriousness of the situation, and its impact on the general justice of freedom and democracy. When reporters asked what assurances he had received from the President, he said, "You should ask the President to explain." When reporters further asked whether our country was still seeking moral support while waiting for the United States to clarify its statement on its policy toward China, the Ambassador said, "That is naturally the case." It is learned that Koo had frankly discussed with the President various possibilities for aiding our country, and had put forward "concrete suggestions regarding our country's immediate need for American aid in both material and moral terms." He also requested to schedule a meeting with Marshall, but no decision was made.

### MacArthur's Appointment

Reportedly Requires Decision by the State Department

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] MacArthur's aides today declined to comment on Washington reports that President Chiang wanted him to be the head of the U.S. military advisory group stationed in . It is said that such an appointment requires a decision by the State Department.

### Soviet Broadcast Propaganda Opposes U.S. Aid to China

Accuses Bullitt of Inciting War

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] Moscow today conducted anti-U.S. aid to China propaganda on its English-language broadcasts to the U.S., accusing Bullitt, who advocates aid to China, of being an open war instigator, and hoping to hinder Truman and Marshall's meeting to formulate a clear policy toward China.

[This Bureau News] Bullitt visited Yu Hongjun, President of the Central Bank, at the bank at 11:30 a.m. yesterday and left after a while. The content of the conversation is unknown. However, because Yu is also the Vice Chairman of the Executive Yuan's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, it is widely believed that the conversation was related to the utilization of U.S. aid.

### Measures for Import and Export Trade and Regulations for Managing Foreign Exchange to be Revised by the Ministry of Finance; Guangzhou to Establish Economic Coordination Committee to Promote Construction; Shanghai's Approval of Foreign Order Import Amounts Sharply Increases

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] In order to adapt to the linked import and export measures, the Ministry of Finance is currently revising the import and export trade measures and their appendices, as well as the Central Bank's foreign exchange management regulations. Finance Minister Xu Kan convened a meeting of representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Central Bank on the 24th to discuss the principles of revision. Xu Kan has also designated Zhang Fuyun, Director of Customs, Zhu Xie, Deputy Director, Wu Xingzhou, Director of the Currency Department, Cheng Dacheng, Counselor, and Wang Zishuang, Deputy Director of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, to be responsible for studying and revising the measures.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 25th] According to relevant sources, an Economic Coordination Committee will be established in Guangzhou to promote the economic construction of South China and to coordinate with the wartime economic system. The committee will be chaired by Huo Baoshu. Regarding the linked import and export system, it began to be implemented here on the 24th. Only two companies completed foreign exchange settlement procedures in accordance with the new method that day. The reason is that various factories are not fully aware of the procedures and are still taking a wait-and-see attitude.

[This City News] According to Zheguan Zengxi: From the 15th to the 20th of this month, import applications for foreign orders for which payment has already been made have had a total of US$219,408.11 in permits issued. This is about ten times the US$22,931.56 in the first week of this month (1st to 6th), and more than two times compared with the second week (8th to 13th).

[Central News Agency, Manila, 24th] Here, the opening exchange rate for Gold Yuan overseas remittances today was 8.2 Philippine pesos per hundred yuan. At the close of the afternoon, it was 7.9 pesos. Banking circles say that this fluctuation is due to the trade import/export system announced by our government last week.

Subsequently, the central government promulgated supplementary measures for financial and economic reform, which changed the gold yuan to U.S. dollar ratio from 4 to 1 to 20 to 1. Therefore, the Taiwan Provincial Government finally adjusted the Taiwan dollar to gold yuan exchange rate in accordance with this ratio, changing it to 370 to 1, effectively increasing the value of the Taiwan dollar fivefold compared to its original value. The Taiwan Provincial Government also announced on the 25th that it would readjust the salaries of public servants in Taiwan Province starting this month.

Special Commentary

### My Humble Opinion on the Revised Emergency Financial and Economic Measures

— Ping Lun

The author is a domestic authoritative economist who has a thorough understanding of the revised measures for issuing the gold yuan and the revised measures for handling gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people, but is unwilling to disclose their name. Our newspaper values their arguments and is introducing them here. - Editor's Note.

Since the government announced the revised measures for issuing the gold yuan and the revised measures for handling gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people on the 12th of this month, the government's economic policy has developed in the opposite direction to the August 19th policy. The legal gold content of the gold yuan has fallen from 0.22217 grams of pure gold to 4.4434 milligrams, the exchange rate of four to one for the U.S. dollar has become a conditional twenty to one, and the possession of gold, silver, and silver coins has gone from being prohibited to being permitted, with conditional redemption. In less than three months, the government's policy has changed to the opposite extreme, and many people must be shocked by the government's rashness and condemn its lack of credibility. A closer analysis reveals that this change is inevitable, and the government's courageous change of policy can be described as deeply appropriate and extremely wise. The August 19th Emergency Economic Measures attempted to solve economic problems with purely political means, and it seems that considerations were not thorough enough. Regarding this point, the author cannot help but feel deeply moved.

Since the accelerated depreciation of the legal currency in 1946, speculation in gold and U.S. dollars on the market has intensified, and social opinion and some short-sighted people have often called for the nationalization of gold. The author once participated in the work of a central design agency as an expert and saw many plans for the nationalization of gold. In addition, the competent department also had this immature plan, and in the summer of 1946, the financial authorities sought the author's opinion on this plan. At that time, the author raised two counterarguments: (1) How to nationalize? Nationalization is not about seizing from the people, but about purchasing from the people at a certain price. One side purchases gold, and the other side releases currency. If that is the case, then how is it different from an expansionary policy using Open Market Operation in the open market? Now that prices are soaring, it is appropriate to contract, so how can an expansionary policy be adopted? The central bank's policy of selling gold should be regarded as a short-term means of dealing with emergencies and is not wrong. The questionable point is that it excessively suppressed the price of gold and foreign exchange, causing the country to lose gold reserves too quickly. If we now reverse course and purchase gold for nationalization in one fell swoop, funds will flood the market, and prices will soar. How can we deal with the aftermath? (2) Gold is a means of savings for the general public. The policy of the former kings was to regulate the people's property, so that they could afford to support their parents and raise their children. Today, the government has no time for this, and no one complains. If even the only means of saving is prohibited, the consequences are truly unimaginable. Consider that the people's hard-earned money has no means of saving, and the depreciation of currency cannot be prevented. Who will not protect their own interests? As a result, there is only the path of waste and hoarding of materials, which is ten thousand times more serious than speculation in gold and foreign currency. Moreover, the people's habits of thousands of years cannot be reversed in a day. Forcing it will inevitably lead to disturbances. India changed to a gold exchange standard policy and stopped using hard currency ten years before China adopted a legal currency policy. Even now, the abundance of gold hidden in the private sector is still the first in the world, and its intake and output of gold and silver affect the world's gold and silver markets. However, the government still never dares to risk the anger of the people to prohibit it. What day is today? How can we invite trouble upon ourselves? At that time, the author also advocated opening the securities market to increase the people's means of saving. It was also said that those who advocate the nationalization of gold today are merely aware that gold speculation is too rampant and contributes to the expansion of credit, and they want to eradicate it. However, they do not know that gold speculation is a natural result of currency depreciation. The government cannot avoid responsibility for currency depreciation, so why should it simply condemn the people's speculation? The financial authorities should find ways to reduce the deficit, contract the currency, stabilize the currency value, and stop the source of gold speculation. They should not worry about the people holding gold. At that time, the financial authorities adopted the author's opinion, so that the panic that occurred a month ago did not occur two years ago, which was fortunate. If we compare the author's arguments at that time with the facts after August 19th of this year, then Finance Minister Xu's proposed amendments to the government are truly timely and appropriate and will be of great help in stabilizing people's hearts and the economy.

Another questionable point after August 19th was the strict use of price controls. The social and economic situation is constantly changing. Even under the condition that the currency state remains unchanged, relative prices still adapt to the state of supply and demand, and change from time to time. The usual academic policy of stabilizing prices refers to stabilizing the price level, not limiting individual prices. A week before August 19th of this year, a certain senior official inquired about controlling prices and controlling the economy. The author strongly stated that it was impossible, saying that without controlling production and supply, simply rigidly controlling the economy and prices would inevitably lead to disaster. China's production units are as numerous as atoms, and the intentions and motivations of production and consumption cannot be controlled by government decrees. If a certain senior official recalls the author's past remarks, they should also feel deeply moved. Those who advocate control often flaunt the control policies of the United Kingdom and other Western countries, but do not deeply consider that even if the control of other countries is successful, it must follow economic principles, otherwise it will inevitably lead to failure. The control of various countries, in principle, increases the profits of special industries, changes the relative status of various industries, and helps the movement of production elements to conform to the government's plan. Has the controller of China ever considered these principles? How can China's objective conditions be widely applied to this kind of plan? To cite Western examples: Before the Great Depression (1929-1933), the intervention policy of the U.S. Federal Farm Board and the Egyptian government's intervention in the cotton market both failed because they ignored economic principles. As a result, the government lost funds, and the normal activities of the market were rigidified, but the seriousness was far less than that of China this time. The United Kingdom does indeed implement comprehensive rationing, but industrialists and businessmen can still export. When the author was in England in the winter of 1946, they examined that British exports had recovered to 97% of the pre-war level, and they planned to increase exports to 170% of the pre-war level in 1948. It is definitely not like China after August 19th, which blocked the source of all profits, making the economic function completely rigid. Speaking of this point, the government seems not to have accepted the opinions of experts. The August 19th Emergency Decree was deeply evasive in advance. According to what the author learned afterwards, many senior government officials did not sympathize with it, and one or two of the people who were ordered to implement it did so with painful and contradictory feelings. Only the "laymen" who had the power to decide were particularly enthusiastic. In the past, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, control and price limits were tested many times and suffered ruthless failures. They were also not worthy of serving as a lesson. Now that price limits have been lifted, the free market has been restored, and the two revisions have been announced, the government's policy has returned to a reasonable path. We can't undo the past, and complaining is useless. Only under the new policy can the whole country unite and cooperate to overcome the current difficulties. After starving millions of people, Lenin's military communism bravely corrected its mistakes and was able to consolidate its regime. We absolutely don't need to be pessimistic.

Secondly, the author also wishes to express a few opinions on the revised measures themselves: (1) The ratio of the gold yuan to gold has changed from 200 to 1,000, the ratio to silver dollars has changed from 2 to 10, and the ratio to U.S. dollars has changed from 4 to 20. All of this is subject to the condition of an equal amount of deposit before it can be exchanged. Some people may accuse the government of breaking its promise and seizing most of the wealth of law-abiding people. This fact is undeniable. However, we must think from a broader perspective. At this time, the government has an obligation and necessity to stabilize the value of the gold yuan. After decades of war in China, the wealth of society and the country is very limited, and productivity has not recovered. Any expert who comes to power can only find the natural level of currency value based on the country's existing wealth. If the value of the gold yuan is overestimated too much, the country will not be able to fully fulfill its promise of redemption, and the gold yuan will not be stable at all. Consider the socio-economic situation a month ago, which was almost destroyed, which is chilling. At this time and place, what the government should strive for and be able to strive for is not the issue of fairness to each individual, but how to obtain a stable currency value, a stable economy, so that production will increase in the future, and everyone will benefit. If we are determined to haggle over the issue of fairness to each individual, then the overall problem will still not be solved, which will not help anything. People who have suffered losses in the past by abiding by the law will be able to feel at ease and free from resentment if they think of this point. (Continued on page 4)

### Beijing and Shanghai慰勞 Groups Arrive in Xuzhou; Present Embroidered Banners and Gift Lists with Great Solemnity; Liu Zhi Hosts a Banquet and Reports on the Great Victory

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 25th] The Beijing and Shanghai慰勞 Groups, led by Group Leaders Zhang Daofan and Fang Zhi, arrived in Xuzhou on the 25th at noon on four special planes to express appreciation to the soldiers at the front lines.

### Taiwan Salt Has Slow Sales; Only Temporary Difficulties; Exchange and Transportation Problems Being Resolved

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Ministry of Finance: Taiwan Salt's planned production quota for this year is 4.4 million units, accounting for 7.8% of the national total production of 56.638 million dan. By October, the actual production in the area was more than 6.964 million dan, which is 92.43% over the planned production (the production from January to October was more than 3.619 million dan). A total of more than 770,000 units have been shipped to Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. There are currently 1.45 million dan of salt that have been allocated to Hunan and Hubei for shipment. However, due to frequent military transportation, the lack of transportation tools, and the suspension of exchange between Taiwan and Shanghai, funds cannot be allocated, which has had a considerable impact for a while. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense and the Taiwan Provincial Government, instructing the military agencies to exempt salt transportation tools from detention and transfer the Taiwan Provincial Bank to open exchange in order to facilitate the transportation of Taiwan salt. In addition, the export of salt from the area to Japan was originally handled by the China Trust Bureau. This year, 22,450 tons have been shipped out, totaling 449,000 dan. About 17,000 tons, totaling 340,000 dan, can be shipped soon. Recently, the Salt Administration sent personnel to Japan to directly negotiate with the Allied Headquarters. The original plan was to export a total of 500,000 tons in the coming year, with Changlu and Taiwan salt fields accounting for half each, namely 250,000 tons each. All related matters have been largely agreed upon. Once the issue of the China Trust Bureau's old debt to the Allied Headquarters is resolved, a contract can be signed and shipments can begin. Based on the above situation, the slow sales of Taiwan salt are originally due to temporary difficulties in exchange and transportation. Once these are resolved, there will be no need to worry about stockpiling.

### France Approved to Participate in Ruhr Control, Equal Rights with Britain and the United States, Sovereignty Returned to Germany, Anglo-American Policy Unchanged

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] According to sources from the British Foreign Office: France's permission to participate in the Ruhr Control Committee has been reviewed by Britain and the United States at a meeting in Paris on the 19th between Marshall, McNeil, and Schuman. The original intention of Britain and the United States was to invite France to participate only after the merger of the three occupation zones in Germany. Therefore, the current action of Britain and the United States in allowing France to participate without waiting for the merger of the three zones is generally regarded as a concession by Britain and the United States to France.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The British Foreign Office announced today: Britain and the United States have agreed to allow France to have full participation in the institutions for inspecting and controlling Ruhr coal and steel, in other words, France's rights in this institution will be completely equal to those of Britain and the United States.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Marshall told reporters today that the United States and Britain intend to return the Ruhr area's coal and steel industries to German management, regardless of France's opposition. At the same time, the US government is also prepared to continue taking various measures to prevent the revival of German militarism. The occupying forces will continue to be stationed in Germany, so there should be no problem with the security of the Ruhr area. I have invited France to join the Anglo-American Coal and Steel Committee to help review various security measures. The final security measures will be stipulated in the peace treaty with Germany. A security committee will be established soon to continue inspecting German industry. The American people deeply sympathize with the French people's concern that their peace and freedom may be threatened, but the reorganization of the Ruhr area's industry is urgently needed to aid West Germany and Europe as a whole. In order to expand production, returning it to German management is crucial.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 25th] Moscow dispatches and comments on the Ruhr issue, stating: France has now proven to have fallen to a secondary status, and the opinions of that country are not valued by Britain and the United States. Not only that, but in the political performance of Britain and the United States, the manipulation of everything and the high-pressure tactics of the United States have become increasingly obvious. It also stated: The 75th law promulgated by General Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Germany, and General Robertson, Commander of the British Forces, handing over the Ruhr to private capital management, is the final surrender of Britain to the United States. The previous position of Britain was to strongly advocate that the Ruhr industry must be socialized. The complete victory of the American view of restoring German private monopolies is closely related to American monopoly capitalists.

### Evatt Attempts to Enlist Four-Power Conference, Rumored Stalin Expresses Agreement, Neutral Countries Urgently Appeal to the Four Powers, Do Not Worsen the Situation in Berlin During the Mediation Period

[United Press, Paris, 24th] It is reported that UN General Assembly President Evatt has received replies from the heads of the four powers to his confidential telegram seeking a resolution to the Berlin crisis. It is believed that Evatt may have suggested a meeting between Truman, Stalin, and other leaders of the four powers. According to reliable sources, Stalin is one of those who have already replied, and there are signs here and in Moscow that the Soviet Union may welcome such a meeting. It is rumored that Evatt hopes that Truman, after being elected, may also express some decisive attitude, not only to resolve the Berlin dispute but also to resolve the general disputes between East and West.

Previously, Evatt and UN Secretary-General Lie jointly appealed to the four powers on the 13th for an immediate meeting to end the Berlin crisis, but the Western powers refused the request. Later, Evatt wanted Lie to join him in sending a telegram to Truman and Stalin, but Lie felt that he was an international official and could not proceed to such an extent. Therefore, Evatt issued the telegram alone. It is believed that Evatt is now studying the possibility of further actions, some of which are based on his confidential telegram. The importance of Evatt's secret telegram is increasing as the attempt to resolve the Berlin crisis through mediation by the Security Council appears to be failing.

[United Press, Paris, 24th] Reliable sources claim that Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, the Security Council's President for the month, has decided to personally make an urgent appeal to the four powers not to exacerbate the tense situation in Berlin during the mediation period. Bramuglia plans to first present this appeal in person to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky tonight, and then to the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France tomorrow. Bramuglia is also scheduled to hold another meeting with the other five neutral countries tomorrow to study the four powers' replies to the Berlin currency issue in order to find clues for a basis for mediation.

### King of England's Right Leg Numb, Rumors of Abdication Untrue

[United Press, London, 24th] Absolutely reliable sources vehemently denied on the 24th rumors that King George VI of England would abdicate to Crown Princess Elizabeth due to poor health. They said: The King has absolutely no intention of abdicating. According to a long article published by the "Daily Mail" on the 24th, the King is currently suffering from "Buerger's disease"—a vascular occlusive disease discovered by Buerger in 1908. In this disease, the arteries in both legs or one leg become inflamed, gradually closing the blood vessels, so that nutrients cannot reach the lower limbs. Sufferers of this disease are mostly middle-aged, and King George is indeed middle-aged—53 years old. The Paris "Echo Report" published news that the King may abdicate and bequeath the throne to Princess Elizabeth. However, according to absolutely reliable sources close to the royal family: "There is absolutely no basis for the news of the King's abdication. This matter has never been considered and will not be considered, even if the King's health deteriorates, there is no need to consider this matter."

### Cabinet Reshuffle in Siam, Fifteen Cabinet Members Resign

Important ministers such as the Minister of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Finance will remain in office, but the three Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force have resigned together.

### French Cabinet Gains Confidence of Parliament, Monnerville Likely to be Elected President of Senate

[United Press, Paris, 24th] Prime Minister Queuille gained three votes of confidence in the National Assembly today, but whether this can represent the true strength of the cabinet's position remains a question.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] Riding on the momentum of gaining a vote of confidence from the National Assembly on the 24th, the French coalition cabinet led by Prime Minister Queuille took a further step on the afternoon of the 25th, planning to consolidate its position in parliament. When the Senate elects its president, the moderates can secure victory. The post of president seems to belong to Monnerville, who, like Queuille, belongs to the Radical Socialist Party.

So far, Monnerville is the only candidate who has been nominated. The Gaullists seem to have only obtained sporadic positions in the Senate. On the evening of the 24th, 12 senators from the Liberal Republican Party, 38 from the Independents, and 15 from the Farmers' Party formed a new party, becoming the second-largest party in the Senate. The Gaullist French People's Rally sharply fell to fourth place. The positions of Vice-President of the Senate and secretaries of various groups are allocated according to the strength of the parties, so the Gaullist position is not very high. Although, amid the left-wing offensive, Queuille's center-right government has encountered a new labor strike. Eighty percent of the members of the French department store union voted to strike next week, and the final decision rests with the joint meeting of the Communist General Confederation of Labor and the centrist Christian Confederation of Labor on the 25th. If the strike is approved, Parisian children will have no toys for Christmas this year. With the labor movement demanding step by step, whether Queuille can unite the Socialist, People's Republican, and Radical parties to maintain the coalition government remains to be seen. Political figures say that Queuille believes that wages must be maintained at the current level in order to balance the budget for the coming year.

### Montgomery Returns to London from France

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Field Marshal Montgomery, Chairman of the Western European Five-Nation Defense Committee, left here today and flew back to London.

### Bloodless Revolution in Venezuela, Government Overthrown, President Under House Arrest

[United Press, Capital of Venezuela, 24th] The army launched a revolution today, overthrowing the government without firing a shot, and announced that it has control of the entire country. Army Chief of Staff Jiménez said that the army launched the revolution because the government led by President Gallegos was incompetent and because extremist elements among the workers attempted to launch a general strike to support the president. Gallegos was elected president only in February of this year and is currently under house arrest at his residence.

[United Press, Capital of Venezuela, 25th] An official announcement: Defense Minister Chalbaud has been elected president of the military government, pending the establishment of a new government. Army Chief of Staff Jiménez and Deputy Chief of Staff Páez will serve as members of the military government.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] A senior official of our country's delegation to Japan told a reporter from the Central News Agency today that he was deeply dissatisfied with the fact that Allied representatives were not allowed to observe the executions. He pointed out that during the Nuremberg war crimes trials, the four powers participating in the trials had jointly organized a joint execution committee composed of officers. He further believed that it was absolutely necessary for Chinese representatives to be present at the executions, as at least four of the seven war criminals being hanged were convicted primarily for their aggression against China.

### Regulations on Secret Execution of Tojo and Others, Our Delegation Expresses Dissatisfaction, Allied Reporters in Tokyo Demand to Observe Hangings

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] The US Eighth Army Public Relations Office announced today that the seven Japanese Class A war criminals sentenced to be hanged, including Hideki Tojo, will enjoy turkey and other items on Thanksgiving, just like the US troops stationed in Japan. According to Colonel Elguer of the General Headquarters Public Relations Office, the prisoners will be executed in approximately two batches, the first batch of four and the second batch of three. This is because the facilities in the prison can only execute four people at a time.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th, United Press] US Army Brigadier General Walker announced on the 18th that Tojo and six other Japanese Class A war criminals would be hanged on a secret date, which has aroused formal protests from the Tokyo Reporters Association. The association is composed of reporters from various Allied newspapers, radio stations, and magazines. They have formally requested General MacArthur's headquarters to allow representatives from the press of each country to participate in the executions, following the precedent of national representation. Given the current situation, the initial external report on the executions will be issued officially. The Reporters Association requests that all reporters be allowed to participate, or at least one reporter be allowed to participate due to limited space and a joint message be issued.

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur's press officer, Elguer, said that "the latest speculation" is that Tojo and others will be hanged next Saturday inside Sugamo Prison in Tokyo. He denied reports that the Far Eastern Commission in Washington had ordered MacArthur to carry out the executions in secret.

### Gratitude for Exonerating Responsibility, Japanese Emperor Hosts Dinner for Keenan

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] Joseph B. Keenan, the chief prosecutor of the Tokyo Military Tribunal, visited the Japanese Imperial Palace on the 24th for lunch with the Japanese Emperor. Keenan returned to the court at 2 p.m. He refused to say a word about the meeting with the Japanese Emperor, but he stated that he would return to the United States within the week. According to the Japanese press, the Japanese Emperor's dinner invitation to Keenan had no special significance, as Keenan had issued a statement that the Japanese Emperor could not be tried as a war criminal, so the Japanese Emperor personally hosted a dinner to express his gratitude.

### Struggle Between Japanese Government and Opposition Parties Becomes Increasingly Fierce, Possible Dissolution of Parliament Due to Head-on Clash

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese opposition parties have officially clashed with the government. At 4 p.m. on the 25th, representatives from the Socialist Party Asanuma, the Democratic Party Komeda, and the National Cooperative Party Takeyama visited Yoshida, Ozawa Mori, and Sato of the House of Representatives, as well as Hirokawa, the secretary-general of the Liberal Party, and handed over a joint statement from the right wing of the opposition parties, demanding the prompt submission of a supplementary budget. Prime Minister Yoshida replied, "There are still difficulties in submitting the budget." After the meeting, representatives from the opposition parties held another meeting in a separate room, deciding to continue demanding that the government submit the budget quickly, while also discussing how to unify the opposition front. It is reported that the government and the Liberal Party have responded to the joint statement from the opposition parties through statements issued by Chief Cabinet Secretary Sato and party secretary-general Hirokawa, stating that it is inappropriate for the opposition parties to use the supplementary budget as an excuse to delay discussions on amending the Civil Service Law. The budget must be completed before it can be submitted, and there is no need to discuss the two together, while the opposition parties have a moral responsibility to discuss the amendment to the Civil Service Law as soon as possible.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The deadlock in the Japanese Diet not only shows no signs of breaking, but the struggle between the ruling and opposition parties is intensifying. The Socialist Party, the major party holding a leading role in the opposition, held a secret general meeting of its members on the evening of the 24th to discuss future action plans. It is reported that they insisted that the amendment to the Civil Service Law must be passed according to the Socialist Party's draft, otherwise they would vote against it, even if it led to the dissolution of the Diet. The issue of dissolution will be entirely handled by the party's Central Executive Committee. The Democratic Party also held a leadership meeting yesterday, studying in detail the Socialist Party's plan for dissolving the Diet that had been submitted to the party. The party resolved to firmly oppose the government submitting the supplementary budget to an emergency meeting of the House of Councillors for approval.

### Truman Hopes Soviet Union Will Join Food and Agriculture Organization

Also Hopes Countries Will Re-Negotiate Wheat Agreement

[United Press, Washington, 24th] President Truman addressed 500 delegates from 57 countries attending the fourth session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization on the 24th. In a moderate tone, he invited the Soviet Union to join the grand alliance against hunger and said: "Cooperation among major countries in food production may make other points of contention easier to resolve." The President said: "Hunger has no nationality," and hoped that all countries could participate in the Food and Agriculture Organization. Truman raised a special issue of global cooperation in the food problem, asking the representatives to try again to negotiate an international wheat agreement. He said: "I deeply regret the failure of this agreement." He continued: "I guarantee that if another wheat agreement can be negotiated, I will definitely submit it to the US Congress next January for approval."

### US East Coast Labor Strike, Agreement Reached

Workers Expected to Return to Work Next Monday

[United Press, New York, 25th] The strike by dockworkers on the US East Coast, which lasted 16 days, has reached an agreement after much negotiation and will begin to resume work.

However, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Director Ching said that workers are expected to return to work next Monday. Ching presided over the meeting on the night of the 24th, mediating and ultimately achieving success.

### Soviet Excavation Team Discovers Ancient Dinosaur Tomb

Tomb Contains Fossils of Ancient Elephants and Birds

[United Press, Moscow, 24th] A Soviet paleontological excavation team led by Professor Yefremov discovered an unprecedentedly huge dinosaur tomb on the 23rd at the site of an ancient river in the Gobi Desert. According to their estimates, "countless specimens of large dinosaurs, ancient elephants, prehistoric turtles, and fossilized birds have been discovered in this tomb, possibly the richest harvest in the history of excavation."

### Anglo-American Views Approaching on Resolving Palestine Dispute, Soviet Union Insists All Foreign Troops Should Withdraw Completely from Holy Land

[United Press, Paris, 25th] Soviet representative Tsarapkin submitted a motion to the UN Political Committee on the 25th, advocating that all Arab armies and other foreign military personnel withdraw completely from Palestine. The Soviet proposal not only applies to the Arab armies that entered the Holy Land after May 15, but also includes the hundreds of British, American, French, and Belgian military observers sent to Palestine by the United Nations to oversee the UN ceasefire order. At the same time, the Soviet Union will also demand that the Security Council take appropriate action to prevent military action from reoccurring in Palestine. Britain originally fully adopted the Bernadotte Plan, but submitted a new proposal on the 25th that was milder than the previous one. Because the United States opposed the original British proposal and offered opinions, the new British proposal includes many suggestions from the United States, so that the two countries can have closer views and thoroughly resolve the Palestine issue. However, the new proposal still differs from the US position on one key point: whether the future borders between the Arabs and Israelis should be rigidly stipulated by the United Nations, or freely negotiated by the two sides. The British proposal clearly stipulates that Israel has a moral responsibility to give up the Negev region in exchange for Western Galilee. The United States, even if it does not intend to completely eliminate this point, at least believes that it should have great flexibility. The Political Committee has currently received countless proposals on the Holy Land, and it is feared that no single proposal can obtain a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly. One diplomat said, "It seems that we will accomplish nothing because of the Negev." The various proposals that the Political Committee has received are as follows: (1) "British Proposal": Establish a UN Conciliation Committee, adopt part of Bernadotte's recommendations, persuade the Jews to give up the Negev, and the Arabs to recognize Israel. (2) "US Proposal": Aims to supplement the British proposal, reduce the importance of the Bernadotte Plan, and allow the Arab and Jewish sides to negotiate a final solution. (3) "Australian Proposal": Reaffirms the UN partition resolution for Palestine, considers Israel's admission to the United Nations at an early date, establishes a conciliation group, and remains silent on borders and other suggestions. (4) "Colombian Proposal": The main viewpoints are roughly similar to the British and American plans, but stipulate that the conciliation committee should include three world-renowned figures designated by the General Assembly, and stipulate that a separate administrative organization for Jerusalem should be established by the Trusteeship Council.

### South Korean Government Sends Letter to Marshall, Urging the US Military to Delay Withdrawal

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 24th] The Seoul government formally notified the US government tonight, hoping that the US military would remain in South Korea to prevent the threat of communism. The South Korean Foreign Minister wrote to Marshall today: "I wish to inform you of the resolution passed by the Korean government on November 22, namely, to request you to postpone the withdrawal of US troops stationed in Korea until Korea can ensure its national defense position." The above letter was requested to be forwarded by the US Ambassador to Korea.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 25th] Twenty thousand members of the right-wing Youth Corps, who hope to become the basic force of the South Korean defense force in the future, held a meeting at the Seoul Sports Field this afternoon and passed a resolution strongly urging the US military to continue to be stationed in Korea until the country can prevent communist aggression with its own strength. The meeting was chaired by the leader of the group, the current Minister of Defense, Lee Beomseok.

### Issues Regarding Tuition Fees at Private Schools: Mayor Announces Handling Measures, Criticizes Principals for Negotiating Multiples of Fees Without Proper Procedures

[Our Report] Although the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city previously announced a general leave of absence, some schools still held classes as usual yesterday. Yesterday, the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools held a press conference at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM to report on the course of this general leave of absence. At 4:00 PM, Director Li of the Bureau of Education convened a meeting at Yucai Middle School with the board members of the Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools and the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools. Only representatives from Shenpei, Xinjian, and Junde schools attended, and the meeting did not take place. At 6:00 PM, representatives of the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools went to the Municipal Government to petition, and Mayor Wu personally received them. The Mayor expressed full sympathy for the difficult lives of the faculty and staff and announced four points of handling measures. He criticized the private school principals for increasing fees without following legal procedures. He believed that the general leave of absence of the faculty and staff was unjustified and would instruct the principals of each school to persuade the faculty and staff to cancel their leave of absence. If this was not possible today, they should resume teaching no later than tomorrow. Mayor Wu also scheduled a meeting with private school principals at 3:00 PM this afternoon in the Municipal Government conference room and instructed Director Li of the Bureau of Education to notify them.

Representatives of the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools, Shi Jiadong, Wang Yunyi, Feng Zhen, and Xia Huanxin, went to the Municipal Government to petition yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, presenting four demands to Mayor Wu: (1) Please clearly state whether the Mayor considers the current tuition fee increase by private schools to be reasonable. (2) Private school faculty and staff should enjoy the same in-kind allocations as municipal school faculty and staff. (3) Please thoroughly investigate Director Li of the Bureau of Education for abusing his position and causing a serious crisis in private schools. (4) Please sanction radio stations and individuals who maliciously slander and insult private schools. Mayor Wu first explained the circumstances of the private school fee increase, stating that the private school principals had previously requested government relief due to the difficult lives of the faculty and staff and the difficulty in maintaining operations. In addition to approving the priority issuance of special rice, the request for government subsidies could not be fulfilled due to the city's tight finances. In principle, it was agreed to appropriately increase tuition fees to subsidize the lives of faculty and staff. However, considering the burden on parents, the principals of each school were instructed to discuss the fee increase with the Bureau of Education. Subsequently, the private school principals held a meeting on their own and decided to increase fees by two to four times, notifying Director Li by telephone. This was extremely unreasonable in terms of procedure. Because traditionally, the issue of tuition fees should first be discussed with the Bureau of Education, and then jointly approved by the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and representatives from all parties, to ensure that school expenses, the lives of faculty and staff, and the burden on parents are all taken into account. However, this time, the private schools increased tuition fees after a decision made by the principals' meeting and then notified the Bureau of Education, which was very inappropriate in terms of procedure.

### Principals Should Be Responsible for the Difficult Lives of Faculty and Staff

Strictly speaking, the private school fee increase is not reasonable. Students' parents pay tuition fees in full at the beginning of the semester, which is equivalent to entering into a contract with the school. The school should be responsible for the student's education for the entire semester, and the school also pays the faculty and staff six months' salary in full at once. However, due to the drastic fluctuations in prices, the salary received by the faculty and staff at one time may not be enough to buy daily necessities. To take into consideration the difficult lives of the faculty and staff, he reluctantly approved the appropriate collection of additional tuition fees, but not up to four times as much. This responsibility does not lie with the faculty and staff, but should be borne by the principals of each school. Therefore, the reply to request (1) is that a reasonable increase will be granted, but the procedures are not appropriate. (2) Regarding the request for private school faculty and staff to receive the same in-kind allocations as municipal schools, Mayor Wu stated that municipal schools pay salaries monthly, while private schools pay a semester's salary in full at the beginning of the semester. The treatment of private schools is already better than that of municipal schools, and the government does not have such in-kind allocations, so it is practically impossible. (3) Regarding the request to thoroughly investigate Director Li of the Bureau of Education, Mayor Wu stated that he would first investigate the responsibility for causing this dispute, asking why Director Li had notified the principals several times to discuss the matter but the principals did not attend. (4) Regarding the request to sanction radio stations for verbally abusing private schools, Mayor Wu claimed that, to his knowledge, the abuse was directed at the principals, not the faculty and staff. One of the representatives immediately stated that some faculty and staff were also abused. For example, Xiao Kuaile once stated on the radio that the principals were bosses, the teachers were prostitutes, and the students were嫖客. Upon hearing this, Mayor Wu stated that the Municipal Government is an administrative organ. In addition to notifying the Bureau of Social Affairs to discourage verbal abuse, faculty and staff who feel insulted can appeal to the courts.

### Mayor Expresses Full Sympathy for Faculty and Staff

The Mayor stated that he fully sympathized with the faculty and staff, but could not sympathize with the actions of some principals. The general leave of absence under martial law is illegal, and this general leave of absence is unjustified, so he hoped that they would resume teaching immediately. Finally, the Mayor announced four points of handling measures: (1) The exact amount of the tuition fee increase will be determined jointly after inviting the Municipal Council and other parties. (2) The tuition fees collected from this increase should be kept by the faculty and staff, and the principals are not allowed to use a single penny. (3) The accounts of schools that have already increased fees for students will be thoroughly investigated. (4) The principals will be instructed to immediately persuade the faculty and staff to cancel their leave of absence and resume teaching to maintain the students' education. If the principals are at fault, the school board will be asked to replace them, otherwise the Municipal Government will send someone to take over.

### Over Two Hundred Silver Shops to Resume Business Today

[Our Report] The silver shops in this city have decided to resume business today. The price of gold ornaments will be in accordance with the regulations of the Gold Control Bureau, which is two thousand one hundred yuan per tael. The purchase price will be a maximum of one thousand nine hundred yuan per tael. The calculation standard for the sale of gold ornaments is based on the Central Bank's price of one thousand yuan per tael, plus a legal profit of 20%, operating expenses of 40%, and a maximum wage of 50%. The selling price of silver ornaments will also be calculated according to this ratio.

Wu Pengnian, the chairman of the Silver Shops Association, and others, went to the Gold Control Bureau yesterday afternoon to meet with Director Lin to discuss the matter. It was decided to comply with the regulations of the Gold Control Bureau. The official document from the Gold Control Bureau approving the Association's resumption of business in accordance with the regulations was also delivered to the Association yesterday afternoon. The Association immediately sent a circular to all of its more than two hundred members for their information and compliance. According to Director Lin of the Gold Control Bureau, the regulated price of two thousand one hundred yuan per tael for the sale of gold ornaments temporarily approved for the silver shops to resume business refers to gold of 995 fineness or higher. If the fineness is insufficient, the price should be reduced proportionally according to the actual fineness.

### Hospitals Request Rice Allocation: Mayor Orders Self-Resolution

He hoped that they would share the difficulties of the time and devote their efforts to solving the problem themselves.

### Wang Jingqi's Remains Arrive in Port Yesterday Morning

[Our Report] Dr. Wang Jingqi, the former Chinese envoy to Poland, died of overwork at his post in Warsaw.

Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and various foreign embassies in the city went to the port to welcome the remains. The ceremony was very solemn. Wang's remains were covered with the national flag and will be temporarily placed at the China Funeral Home on Huashan Road. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office has scheduled a public memorial service at the hall of the funeral home at 10:00 AM on the 28th, and the remains will be transported to Hangzhou for burial at a later date.

### Private School Faculty and Staff Association Reports on General Leave of Absence, Blames Director Li of the Bureau of Education

[Our Report] The Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Middle and Elementary Schools held a press conference at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Shi Jiadong and Wang Weiqun reported on the course of the general leave of absence of faculty and staff of private middle and elementary schools, stating: (1) This fee increase is entirely for the livelihood of colleagues and cannot be privately obtained by the principals. (2) The principals have suffered unjust accusations for the livelihood of their colleagues. (3) Salaries of faculty and staff account for 70% of the tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by the schools, while administrative expenses account for only 30% at most. The rumor that principals can obtain 70% is untrue. (4) In general, school board members of private schools are unable to be responsible for the school's finances, so the schools appropriately collect fees from students' parents, taking from the students and using it for the students. (5) The government authorized the schools to collect fees because it was unable to provide subsidies. (6) The principals and faculty and staff are mostly law-abiding and have not dared to hoard goods. Now they are affected by the currency devaluation. (7) Although the schools have set fee amounts for this fee increase, they are by no means mandatory and are only the maximum limit. Students from poor families and children of public school teachers are allowed to reduce or waive fees if they are truly unable to pay. Schools have never refused. (8) This general leave of absence was truly forced. The Bureau of Education allowed the collection of fees previously, but then stated that it never approved it, causing social surprise and parental bewilderment. Colleagues believe that livelihood is a small matter, but dignity is a big matter. The Director of the Bureau of Education, as the leader of the colleagues, does not respect himself and places the colleagues in a state of bewilderment, causing parental blame and social disturbance. 士可殺而不可辱, hence they were forced to take this general leave of absence.

### Shanghai Prison Murder Case: Coffin Exhumed for Re-Examination Yesterday: Suspect Guards Summoned for Questioning: Contradictions Discovered in Confessions: Further Investigation Scheduled for Today

[Our Report] The case of the assassination of Jin Duanliang, a guard at Shanghai Prison No. 26, had been determined by autopsy to be caused by fatal burns inflicted with a high-temperature iron object while he was alive. It had been investigated in court several times, and relatively rich leads had been obtained. The District Prosecutor's Office recently exhumed the coffin at the request of Warden Kong Xianglin. The coffin was exhumed in Minhang again yesterday and transported to the Changde Road autopsy site for re-examination. After the coffin was opened, the body was already rotting, but the two wounds on the thighs were still obvious, and the wound on the genitals was also clearly visible. After re-opening the chest for examination, Sun Kui, the director of the Forensic Medicine Research Institute and the director of the Shanghai Prison Hospital, cut off the genitals and took them away along with the heart. They then went to the prison scene, where Sun Kui, Cao Hong, Tang Meiqiao, Kong Xianglin, Huo Chunsheng, and Gao Yongan conducted a detailed investigation and summoned suspect guards Wang Fuming and Ding Shouxing for questioning. It was discovered that the confessions of the two contradicted each other, and the prosecutor believed that they were highly suspicious. However, because it was late, all the relevant guard staff could not be summoned. It was decided that a detailed investigation would be conducted at the prison again at 9:00 AM today. Prosecutor Cao handed the list of about ten relevant people to Warden Kong Xianglin for safekeeping. It is expected that this case will be clarified soon under the close attention of all parties.

Curbing Obstruction of Customs and Freight to Ensure Smooth Flow of Goods

It is found that the actions of local governments to obstruct the exit of materials originated from the strict implementation of the price control policy. Even though the government promulgated supplementary measures for financial and economic reforms on October 30th of this year, which clearly stipulated that local governments should not hinder the flow of goods and that those who arbitrarily obstruct customs and freight would be severely punished, it is inevitable that there are cases where freight traffic is still delayed due to adherence to established practices or failure to receive clear orders. It is requested that your esteemed Yuan and Ministry effectively curb this situation to ensure the smooth flow of goods and balanced supply and demand to help stabilize prices. This is one point. It is found that the suspension of the stock exchange originated at the beginning of the currency reform, and its purpose was undoubtedly to completely eliminate speculation and indirectly assist in the completion of the August 19th price control policy. Now that the price control has been lifted and the situation has changed, the promotion of subsequent policies should focus on supporting production and dredging floating capital as urgent tasks. The establishment of a stock exchange is mainly to execute the intermediary between productive enterprises and investors and to absorb floating capital into the task of investing in the right track. If it is desired to revitalize productive enterprises and curb the evil of floating capital in the future, the stock exchange should be resolutely allowed to resume operations immediately. This is the second point.

Abolish Cost-Based Pricing to Restore a Free Market

The rise and fall of prices has its natural law in economics, the so-called scarcity of goods leads to high prices, while abundance leads to low prices. If efforts are not made to increase production and dredge the source of goods, but instead to suppress the natural changes in prices, it is like trying to stem the flow of a river to the east, and it is likely to eventually breach. The failure of the past price control policy can serve as a warning. Since the government promulgated supplementary measures for financial and economic reforms and lifted price controls, prices have risen once, but have recently gradually stabilized. In many cases, the decline from the time of the rise has been more than half. This is a reflection of the gradual normalization of supply and demand as the source of goods is smooth. Unfortunately, the supplementary measures failed to completely open up price controls, and the negotiated pricing system based on cost-based pricing was still retained. Its malpractices have made it impossible for both producers and retailers to completely avoid the pain of decoupling. As a result, the production side still feels that the supply of raw materials is difficult, and sales merchants also have the trouble of cost-based pricing, which is contrary to the natural law of economics. From a purely economic standpoint, since the rise and fall of prices have their natural levels, it is better to remove the root cause than to simply pour soup to stop boiling. If the cost-based pricing method can be abolished and the free market can be completely restored, while strictly cracking down on hoarding and speculating, and effectively dredging the source of goods, supporting production, and guiding floating capital to the right track, then price stability can be ensured. This is the third point.

Handling of Profit and Loss Items: Please Exempt Income Tax

In addition, Article 8, paragraph 2 of the recently promulgated and implemented "Measures for the Registration of Changes in the Conversion of Registered Capital of Profit-Making Enterprises into Gold Yuan" stipulates: "If the amount of capital obtained by deducting all liabilities from the estimated assets exceeds the standards stipulated in these measures, the excess part shall be treated as profit and loss items…". The phrase "should be treated as profit and loss items" was not in the original draft and was added during the amendment. The main purpose is that the portion of the asset estimate that exceeds the standard capital amount should be regarded as the income of the profit-making enterprise, requiring it to pay income tax. However, it is not known that the portion of the asset estimate that exceeds the standard capital amount is not the income of the enterprise itself, but purely a manifestation of the adjustment and restoration of the low currency value over the years. There is absolutely no increase in the net assets of the enterprise. Therefore, it is unreasonable to order it to pay income tax in accordance with the law. This point should also be corrected to relieve the difficulties of industry and commerce. This is the fourth point. Since the implementation of the currency reform and the implementation of price control policies, raw materials have been blocked, production has shrunk, panic buying has been rampant, and nine out of ten stores have been empty. After the opening of price controls, prices have soared. Stores have made huge losses in purchasing goods in the original currency, and some have even been unable to resume business. For the benefit of industry and commerce, the government should take measures to remedy the situation. The Association suggests that the central government approve the exemption of profit-making enterprises from income tax for the first half of the 38th year (i.e., the income of profit-making enterprises in the second half of the 37th year), which must be said to be an urgent and reasonable requirement. This is the fifth point. Obey Orders to Register Various Goods: It is Improper to Purchase According to Price Limits

In addition, the Association telegraphed the Bureau of Social Affairs regarding the matter that various goods registered by industry and commerce should not be purchased according to price limits, stating: Since important daily necessities and industrial raw materials have been changed to cost-based pricing, it is no longer appropriate to use price limits. It is improper for the government to forcibly purchase goods at the price limits, giving law-abiding merchants an undue blow. If it is said that the cost price of these registered items is mostly below the price limits of August 19, it is appropriate to collect them at the price limits, then the only option for factories and commercial establishments that sell at the price limits and then replenish at market prices of ten or dozens of times is to go bankrupt, which is very clear. In this situation, it is tantamount to confiscating their registered items. The government favors a portion of the population while causing industry and commerce to suffer an undue sacrifice, which is no different from neighboring as firm. Moreover, among the items in the general registration scope, the only ones that are necessary for personal or family life are rice, flour, cloth, cooking oil, coal, and sugar. As for呢羢 and cigarettes, they are neither within the scope of banning important daily necessities nor in the list of general registration of daily necessities, and it seems even more inappropriate to move from类 and as class, without any choice. Since the country is in a difficult situation, consolidating the hearts of the people is the first priority. The first measure to deal with it is to implement Article 7 of the Constitution, which stipulates that "All people of the Republic of China are equal before the law, regardless of class". Respectfully expressing my humble opinion, I hope that your esteemed Bureau will review the situation and transfer the correct opinion, so that the涸轍's attached, can celebrate the re-birth, which is truly a public convenience.

Enclosed with Fixed Deposit Certificates in Gold: Please Allow Circulation and Transfer

Furthermore, in accordance with the resolution of the members' congress, the Association requested the government to allow the circulation and transfer of gold that is attached to fixed deposit certificates of the same amount in order to show monetary credit. The Association also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting that it be adopted and implemented.

Also, at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a cooking accident occurred at the office of Yuanfengxing Kee Timber Company, Room 406, No. 133 Jiujiang Road. It was extinguished immediately, and the damage was minor.

### British Warship "Sussex" Arrives in Shanghai

### Compelled to Lay Down Razors - Request to Raise Prices Not Permitted - Barber Shops Close Down One After Another - Industry Representatives Express Responsibility to the Government

Due to the barbering industry's request to adjust prices not being approved by the authorities, most barber shops in various districts such as Eastern Shanghai have automatically closed down since yesterday. The industry's labor union, because capitalists are forcing workers to stop work, affecting their livelihoods, specially dispatched representatives to see Mayor Wu at the city government at 9:00 AM yesterday to report the facts of the matter. They stated that the responsibility for the closure should lie with the capitalists and requested an order to the industry association to resume normal operations. The mayor stated that the case should be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the representatives left accordingly. In the afternoon, labor and management each sent dozens of representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. The capitalist association also submitted a cost calculation table, stating that since the price restrictions were lifted, workers' meals, fuel, decorations, and other supplies have generally increased more than twentyfold. They requested, in accordance with the government's principle of setting prices based on cost, that adjustments be permitted. The Social Affairs Bureau official in charge stated that the industry has already been approved twice since the price restrictions were lifted, increasing prices a total of ninefold. Therefore, any further adjustment of sales prices should wait until the publication of the cost of living index at the end of the month, and ordered both parties to resume business immediately. Worker representatives also stated that the shops told them that if they wanted to open for business, they would only provide two meals of thin porridge per day. If they closed down, they would continue to provide three meals of white rice as before. Some people are also instigating a "general leave" of all barbers in the city. The workers agree with adjusting sales prices, but do not agree with the tactic of using workers' leave.

At the same time, we believe that if we can truly do something to express this friendship, then China's talents will surely be recognized again."

Regarding the displacement caused by the evacuation of Americans, Cabot said, "This is nothing more than our hope to once again earnestly express our long-standing friendship with China, hoping that they will be rescued from the tyranny of foreign imperialism."

### Motor Vehicle Taxes - Penalties for Overdue Payments

[Our Correspondent] The collection of motor vehicle license tax and municipal construction tax in Shanghai, which began on the first of this month, has reached two-thirds of the total amount. In order to avoid congestion, the Finance Bureau has scheduled a phased payment process, expecting to collect the full amount by the end of next month. Overdue payments will be subject to a penalty of one times the tax amount. For municipal construction tax, overdue payments within 10 days will be penalized at one-tenth of the tax amount, within 20 days at two-tenths, and within 30 days at three-tenths. The vehicle license will also be withheld.

### Personal Views on the Amendments to Emergency Economic Measures (Continued from Page 2)

(2) Regarding the issue of conditional redemption, the government has indeed taken on a significant burden. Originally, under currency management, domestic redemption was unnecessary. All gold and foreign exchange were concentrated for use as a tool for international balance of payments. Even the strong United States is no exception. How do they maintain the value of their currency? First, the quantity of currency strictly adapts to the needs of the social economy. Second, when settling international balance of payments deficits, gold and foreign exchange are still used according to a fixed ratio. Within the country, the currency is uniformly paper money, but in the foreign exchange market, there is still a fixed standard, and international balance of payments obligations are strictly fulfilled. In normal times, currency is merely a medium of exchange. If holders can obtain foreign exchange or gold to settle international balance of payments deficits according to a fixed ratio when necessary, it will not shake confidence in the value of the currency. The legal tender (fapi) policy of 1935 was successfully built on this theory. Unfortunately, this natural and reasonable method can no longer be used. After the accelerated devaluation of legal tender and the past Gold Yuan, the people have lost confidence in non-redeemable paper money and can only "flee from the currency" (Flied from the Currency). Fleeing from the currency is equivalent to the collapse of the currency. To rescue this crisis, there is no other way but redemption. The British pound has also experienced similar disasters several times in history, and they were overcome by using redemption policies. However, fulfilling the obligation of redemption is indeed a major burden on the government. The obligation of redemption must develop in direct proportion to the amount of Gold Yuan issued, or even super-proportionally. The government should be vigilant about this. Financially, it is necessary to gradually bring revenue and expenditure closer to balance, cultivate sources of tax revenue, increase income, and reduce unnecessary expenditures. In terms of finance, it is necessary to stop the low-interest policy that promotes inflation. In normal times, the central bank's benchmark interest rate leads the market interest rate. In times of inflation, the market interest rate forces the central bank's benchmark interest rate to change accordingly. If the central bank disregards market conditions and always maintains a low-interest policy, idle funds will not be drawn in, lending will expand more and more, the quantity of currency will increase too rapidly, and the stability of the currency and the practice of redemption will inevitably face great difficulties. We anticipate that after the implementation of the amendment measures, the value of the currency will gradually become stable, and people's confidence will naturally recover. The next step is to consider the conditional and comprehensive opening of foreign exchange. Because in the long run, it is much more economical to stabilize the value of the currency with foreign exchange than with gold and silver (it can save currency materials), and the effect is no different. This long-term prospect does not need to be elaborated on for the time being. But the government authorities must plan in advance. As for dealing with the black market for gold and banknotes, we cannot have excessive expectations for the two amendment measures. Since foreign exchange trading is not completely open, and gold and silver are only conditionally redeemable, the black market for gold and banknotes is bound to persist for a short period of time. Since exchanging gold and silver requires paying the same amount of deposit, those who are unwilling to fulfill this condition but still want to hold gold and silver will inevitably seek it in the market at a high price. But even if the black market exists, prices must fluctuate within a fixed limit, so a standard of value can be established no matter what, and a stable economy can be produced under a stable standard of currency value. Furthermore, there is nothing to fear from people saving gold and silver. Only rampant waste or hoarding of materials when a standard of value does not exist is a fatal injury to the national economy. In the past, financial management concentrated its efforts on investigating and prohibiting the possession of gold, banknotes, and silver, which can be said to be abandoning the root and pursuing the branches, and at the same time losing popular support. In fact, financial management should have its reasonable scope. It is a pity that the authorities in the past failed to put more effort into the positive aspects. It is hoped that the financial authorities will be able to make a statement on this in the future. Furthermore, if there is a difference between the market price and the official price of gold and banknotes, then the restoration of the foreign exchange settlement certificate system is also a matter of course. Because only in this way can the official and market rates tend to be consistent, thereby stimulating exports and absorbing overseas remittances, in order to facilitate the implementation of the new monetary system.

Finally, I would like to put forward two expectations: First, I hope that the government can adopt more of the opinions of experts. Financial and economic problems are really too complicated and cannot be handled by being clever on one's own. Chinese society is not without talent. It is a great loss to the country that talent is submerged and the government has no way to approach it. Second, I hope that powerful people who do not understand specialized issues, regarding specialized issues, will remain silent for a while. Finance and economics require ten years of academic study to even begin to speak, and even being able to cite a few foreign textbooks may not count for much, let alone reading some encyclopedias or the like. What is the use? It is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the entire field of social sciences and to integrate it with the country's cultural traditions in order to have the qualifications to speak on China's finance and economics. The lives and property of hundreds of millions of people must not be repeatedly experimented with by "outsiders"! The lessons of the past few decades have been painful enough!

###慰勞團昨晨飛徐　記者訪問團同行

### Police Bureau Revises Fines for Vehicle Violations

The Municipal Police Bureau recently announced that the fines for vehicle violations in Shanghai, which were previously passed by the Municipal Government meeting, were set at 1 Jinyuan or more and 10 Jinyuan or less for non-motorized vehicles, and 1 Jinyuan or more and 30 Jinyuan or less for motorized vehicles. However, since the price restrictions were lifted, prices have been adjusted, and these fines seem inappropriate. The Police Bureau has now re-drafted a set of fines, which are: (1) A first violation for non-motorized vehicles will be fined 1 Jinyuan to 10 Jinyuan. (2) A first violation for motorized vehicles will be fined 5 Jinyuan to 50 Jinyuan. (3) For both non-motorized and motorized vehicles, a second violation will be subject to a penalty of one-half of the original fine. Anyone who continuously violates the rules three times within three months may have their license revoked. These fines have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and have been ordered to be implemented by all subordinate branches.

The representatives then went to the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition, stating the difficulties of the industry and hoping that the relevant authorities would understand the difficulties of businesses and accept their request.

### Small Soccer Final - Railway and Zhichao

[Our Correspondent] The final match of the Third Small Soccer Field Tournament, Zhichao vs. Railway, was held at the Nanshi Stadium at 3:00 PM yesterday. Due to the inclement weather, the audience was only about 2,000 people. As a result, a double goose egg, zero to zero, was not divided the victory. Because of the rain, both sides agreed not to extend the time, and the game ended in a tie. The remaining decision, will be determined by the Small Soccer Commission. In the first half, both sides had offensive. Zhichao's general Wu Qixiang sat in the back, and the Railway's multiple offenses relied on Wu Qixiang's proper rescue to avoid incidents. Zhichao's surrounded attack, Railway's inner guard fouled 13 yards from the gate, Wu Qixiang kicked, but was saved by Liao Xiong. Neither side scored in the first half.

In the second half, drizzle drizzled, the stadium was muddy and unbearable, the ball was difficult to control, and the two sides fought in the rain, and the excitement was greatly reduced. As a result of the fierce battle between the two sides, they never managed to enter the door. After that, the rain became heavier, and the heroes were even more useless. At the end of the time, the two sides shook hands and made peace.

### Ample Supply, Slow Movement - Rice Market Listless - Flour, Grains, and Oil Prices All Decline

Yesterday's rice market was stable in the Nanshi market and declined in the Beishi market. Due to sluggish sales, rice shops were very disinterested. Arrivals were still smooth, especially the early and late rice and thin rice new crops from Nangang, with low prices at the origin. With ample supply and slow movement, the price of white rice in Beishi retreated to 55 Jinyuan, thin rice to 430 Jinyuan, and early rice and others fell by 25 to 20 Jinyuan. In the Nanshi market, the prices of thick and thin rice barely stabilized, and early rice fell by 5 Jinyuan. The market outlook is even more tired and lacks takers. Prices for Yin rice and white rice are the softest. Yesterday, 4,226 shi of goods arrived in the Nanshi market, and 5,604 shi in the Beishi market, totaling nearly 10,000 shi.

Flour continued to decline, due to sluggish sales and high interest rates, owners were eager to sell, so the market could not rise. Lao Che flour opened at 140 Jinyuan, and Bingshun at 135 Jinyuan, each falling by 5 to 7 Jinyuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng each fell by 2 to 3 Jinyuan. Xiong brand flour was abundant in supply, and prices fell by 3 to 4 Jinyuan. Bran sales were still active in rural areas, and prices stabilized. Wheat was at 180 Jinyuan.

Grains uniformly declined again, the market atmosphere was weak, sales were very strong, but actual sales were quite sluggish and difficult to sell, so prices declined. Factories did not take soybeans, and finally sold at 155 Jinyuan, falling by about 10 Jinyuan. Red rice was supplied in large quantities but sales were sluggish, falling by 5 Jinyuan. Corn from the northern gangs was slightly touched, and the price barely stabilized. There was not much trading in Yuan wheat and Mung beans, and the market was said to be stable. The price of selected green beans did not rise or fall. Sesame was reduced by 20 to 30 Jinyuan. There were many arrivals of raw peanuts, falling by 50 to 60 Jinyuan.

Edible oil prices finally fell again due to the sluggish sales situation. The main street was not interested, customer sales were stagnant, and factories opened a lot, but there were few takers. Soybean oil was 760 Jinyuan, but was taken at a lower price of 730 Jinyuan, falling by 50 Jinyuan. Vegetable oil was 610 and 590 Jinyuan, falling by 20 Jinyuan. Raw oil fell by 60 Jinyuan, Jiton raw oil was 960 Jinyuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil was 770 Jinyuan. Soybean cake was bought by the Shantou gang, and the situation was unique. Yu Ji cake was 69 Jinyuan, rising by 4 Jinyuan.

### Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates - Market Price Unchanged

The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates remained at 25 Jinyuan yesterday, the same as the day before, with no rise or fall. Overseas remittances poured in, and exporters prepared more export funds, but importers needed less because import quotas had not yet been issued, so the market price was not easily raised.

### Export Merchants Hope for Improvement

Additional News: Although there have been transactions in foreign exchange transfer certificates recently, the transaction price of 25 Jinyuan is still about 40% away from the current actual price. Export merchants in Shanghai are all concerned about this phenomenon. They believe that if this disconnect is not quickly improved, it may have a great impact on the export business and overseas remittances, which are showing signs of improvement. They also pointed out that the formation of this phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that the Import and Export Management Committee has not yet relaxed and accelerated the issuance of import permits. Therefore, they hope that the Import and Export Management Committee can make a quick decision on relaxing the audit standards for imports. However, officials believe that this is an inevitable phenomenon at the beginning, and they believe that in the near future, a reasonable standard for the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates will be found.

### Banks Suspend Overdrafts and Loans

Yesterday, the money supply tightened, and interest rates rose.

The Bankers Association urgently informed all member banks and firms yesterday, stating that the market has been fluctuating quite sharply recently. From now on, overdrafts and loans will be suspended, and short-term interbank lending and commercial paper discounting will be the main focus.

Yesterday, the money supply suddenly tightened again, and the black market interest rate rose to 30%. The reasons for this are: (1) A lot of idle funds flowed south, while remittances to Shanghai decreased, resulting in a shortage of funds. (2) The government has sold a lot of gold and silver dollars in recent days, resulting in a greater shortage of cash.

### Export Goods Overdue for Exchange Settlement

Calculated at 70% of the Exchange Settlement Certificate

[Our Correspondent] The Business Bureau of the Central Bank specially issued Circular No. 163 yesterday to all designated banks, stating that: Regarding the regulations for overdue exchange settlement of export consignment goods, from now on, it will be calculated at 70% of the foreign exchange transfer certificate price on the date of exchange settlement. The bank's previous Circular No. 158 should be repealed.

### Deposits Exchanged for Gold and Silver - Significantly Increased Compared to Previous

[Our Correspondent] The number of deposits exchanged by national banks on the 24th increased significantly compared to the previous few days. On that day, the four banks of Zhongzhongjiaonong redeemed a total of 2,400 taels, 4 mace, 1 fen, and 6 li of gold, recovering 2,400,416 Jinyuan. 24,353 silver dollars were redeemed, recovering 243,532 Jinyuan. The above totaled 2,643,946 Jinyuan recovered. Deposits also increased by one time, totaling 5,287,892 Jinyuan recovered.

### Whether the Stock Exchange Will Resume Operations - Still Awaiting Decision from Authorities

[Our Correspondent] Gu Shanchang, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, went to Nanjing on the 23rd to negotiate with the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and returned to Shanghai a few days ago.

It is speculated that Gu's trip was related to requesting the resumption of the stock exchange's operations. However, according to Gu, he held comprehensive talks with the relevant authorities of the two ministries on the securities business in a detached position. In particular, the issue of the issuance of stocks of state-owned enterprises was discussed in detail. As for the resumption of the stock exchange's operations, it is still awaiting a final decision from the authorities.

### Guests from Elsewhere Constantly Searching for Purchases - Cotton Yarn Triggers a Rising Trend - Cloth Sales Sluggish, Price Fluctuations Narrow

Yesterday's yarn market was driven by the influx of idle funds into the market, with the money supply gradually loosening. Yarn firms on the main street and the Guang gang all started to become active, absorbing all available yarns, both thick and thin, causing the market atmosphere to suddenly become excited.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn saw asking prices surge past 12,000 customs taels. Although there were profit-taking sales in the middle, the market quickly recovered as buyers' appetite was too strong, and the market continued to soar, rising all the way to 12,800 yuan at the close, up another 600 yuan from the previous day.

21-count Double Horse yarn saw particularly strong buyers. As soon as asking prices were announced, they rose, and at noon, they rose again to close at 9,800 yuan, a uniquely large increase of 1,700 yuan. Other 16-count Benteng, 10-count Boy Scout, 20-count Jincheng, and 32-count and 40-count and other various thick and thin yarns were sought by Guang gangs from outside the industry to be transported south, and the trend was surprisingly brisk. As a result, asking prices were uniformly raised by 400-500 yuan to 1,300-4,500 yuan.

The cloth market saw sluggish actual sales and abundant supplies. The Tianjin gang was selling a lot of goods, but cloth merchants and door shop gangs on the main street were not interested, and price fluctuations were very small.

12-pound Longtou fine cloth once showed a rising trend in the middle, but finally remained at the original price of 365 yuan, leveling with the previous day. Sijunzi yuan billi fabrics, built by the textile factory, were sluggish, and the results were similar to the previous day. The market atmosphere for other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and Shilin cloth was also very flat.

Spot Cotton Rises

The spot cotton market yesterday saw prices rise due to the sudden surge in cotton yarn. The prices of various grades of fine velvet averaged an increase of 10%, but most of the transactions were still scattered. There were later inquiries for Zhoupu fenhua cotton, but there was no increase in price yesterday.

### Tea Market Buzzing with Buying Activity

The domestic tea market continued to see transactions yesterday in the main street and other places, and the market atmosphere was lively. As for export box tea, although the buying interest of exporters such as Tongfu, Huacha, Yihe, Wuchang, and Xinhua in Shanghai was as strong as ever, holders of tea were still cautious due to depleted inventories and thoughts sparked after the announcement of the new foreign exchange transaction methods. Asking prices soared even more like kites off the string, soaring all the way to the clouds. It is said that the annual Wutun tea from the main gang was asking for as much as 1,600 yuan per load, and special Qimen tea even required 2,000 yuan, while Pingshui tea from the main gang was 1,000 yuan, and they were unwilling to part with it, making transactions more difficult to unfold. However, the situation is becoming more and more solid, and the future is more likely to rise than fall.

### Food Continues to Decline

The sugar market yesterday remained sluggish. Out-of-town sales were sluggish, and inventories on the main street were abundant. The market was miserable. Furthermore, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation distributed coarse sugar again, and the industry was scrambling to make up for the shortfall, and the money supply showed a slight tightness. The market moved into a soft phase. No. 45 Chebai fine sugar closed at 350 yuan, down slightly by 5 yuan. Coarse sugar and medium sugar turned flat after softening, and the market was neither good nor bad. Xinghua white and Zhang Diaoqing were all weak.

### Today's Refuge for Hong Kong's Upper-Class Refugees

— Our Correspondent, Ziqian

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 20th] The Taikoo Shipping Company's Shengjing vessel arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai on the 19th, instantly recreating a "Refugee Fleeing Famine" scene at the Central waterfront that had not been seen for many years. This situation was akin to the chaos, hustle, and bustle of refugees awaiting ships to leave Hong Kong during its occupation. However, this time, the "refugees" were arriving in Hong Kong, not leaving. Hong Kong, this small island, is now once again playing its role as a haven for Chinese "refugees," a position it has assumed repeatedly in modern Chinese history. Before the Shengjing vessel arrived in Hong Kong, there were already four or five special flights chartered by wealthy individuals from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Many people were also taking the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to escape to Hong Kong via Guangzhou every day. However, these were all wealthy individuals, each well-dressed and with full purses. The people of Hong Kong treated them as ordinary tourists. However, the passengers on the Shengjing vessel mostly appeared impoverished, fully embodying the essence of "refugees."

Hotels of All Sizes Announce Full Occupancy

In Hong Kong Central, officials have been busy planning the work of accommodating "refugees" these past two days. However, their target for accommodation is British expatriates withdrawing from North and Central China to Hong Kong, unrelated to the yellow-faced, black-eyed Chinese "refugees." This is because hotels of all sizes in Hong Kong Central have now announced that they are fully occupied. Our millionaires and billionaires have even taken over foreign-owned hotels. For the sake of money, the hotel owners are too embarrassed to ask these newly arrived "upper-class Chinese" to leave.

Business Booms, Premium Prices Rebound

The lukewarm atmosphere in Hong Kong at the beginning of the issuance of Gold Standard banknotes has now become a thing of the past. According to reliable sources, it is estimated that Hong Kong has gained 5,000 to 7,000 people in the past two or three weeks. Although they are not all rich and powerful figures, they are at least their assistants, advance troops, and family members, etc. Since the hotels are filled by them, foreign general merchandise companies, woolen shops, the catering industry, and entertainment venues have also seen their profits triple due to their arrival, creating an atmosphere of prosperity. The premium prices for new buildings, which had been declining two months ago, have now rebounded. For example, new buildings on the edge of Causeway Bay used to have a premium price of about 6,000 yuan per floor, but now it has increased to 10,000 yuan, and the rent has increased from 300 yuan per month to 400 yuan, but there is still more demand than supply.

Five Gold Ingots - All Confiscated

A Reuters London dispatch on the 17th said that the British House of Commons has noted the situation of "a large number of Chinese refugees entering Hong Kong without restriction." It is generally speculated that the Hong Kong government may restore the immigration law that was once implemented before the war to cope with this situation, restricting the entry of Chinese people. However, the Hong Kong government may be too busy welcoming the above-mentioned upper-class "refugees," and the targets of their consideration for restriction are probably the type of people carried by the Shengjing vessel.

The day before yesterday, at Kai Tak Airport, the wife of a tycoon had five gold ingots on her, which were seized by Hong Kong Customs. Those gold ingots were naturally confiscated (Hong Kong regulations prohibit the import of gold). A message to those coming to Hong Kong: do not carry gold, otherwise, you will give your money to others for nothing. Not only will they not thank you, but they will also send you to court!

### Further Response to Readers Regarding Scholarships

On the 23rd of last month, we provided a general response to readers regarding the "Reader Scholarship Fund." Now that this year's scholarship work is nearing its end, many readers and applicant students have written to inquire, so we are providing another general response here. At the same time, we want to express our deep hope to the listed schools, appealing on behalf of poor students.

Of the students who applied for our newspaper's Reader Scholarship Fund, 329 were initially approved by our newspaper, including 95 private universities, colleges, middle schools, and vocational schools. Later, after a review by the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, only 137 were approved. The remaining 192 were not approved because the schools they attended either never submitted a roster of tuition-free students to the Scholarship Unified Review Committee for verification, or the roster was submitted but the number of tuition-free spots was insufficient. We have heard that the Scholarship Unified Review Committee will transfer these affected students to the Education Bureau to instruct the schools to provide tuition-free education; however, we cannot predict whether the schools will comply.

The following 16 schools did not submit a roster of tuition-free students:

Huxin Middle School Yuhnianhui Middle School

Minzhi Middle School Dongnan Middle School

Mengxian Middle School Weiyu Middle School

Dade Midwifery China Middle School

Xinhua Middle School Minli Middle School

Qixiu Girls' Middle School St. Francis Middle School

Zhengzhong Middle School Attached Middle School of the Law School

Zhengzhong Girls' Middle School Patriotic Girls' Middle School

The following 19 schools had an insufficient number of tuition-free spots:

Guangcheng Pharmaceutical Vocational Jiangxi Middle School

Xihua Middle School Zhende Middle School

Minli Girls' Middle School Xiejin Middle School

Huaien Middle School Datong Attached Middle School Second Hospital

Chongshi Middle School Xuhui Girls' Middle School

Dongnan Pharmaceutical Vocational Datong Attached Middle School First Hospital

Yueche Middle School Jiancheng Middle School

Jingwen Girls' Middle School Nanyang Middle School

Zhenche Attached Middle School Xiaoming Girls' Middle School

Yuedong Middle School

According to the regulations of the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, students applying for scholarships from any organizations or groups must be attending a school that already has the required number of tuition-free spots in order to be approved. This was originally intended to prevent schools from "being generous at others' expense," but in reality, it has affected the application rights of poor students. Our Reader Scholarship Fund aims to help poor students, and it is truly regrettable that they have been denied assistance due to the schools they attend. In addition to expressing our deepest apologies and concern, we hope that the Scholarship Unified Review Committee's remedial measures will be readily accepted by the schools.

Nowadays, many people believe that many private schools in Shanghai are "degree mills," but this is not entirely true. We firmly believe that the purpose of the schools listed above is to cultivate talent, and that the administrators are all well-known figures in the education field. The fact that the number of tuition-free spots is insufficient or that no roster of tuition-free students was submitted may be due to other difficulties and reasons that are understandable. Therefore, we are confident that the authorities of these schools will be able to make an effort to accept the Scholarship Unified Review Committee's remedial measures and ensure that poor students are not disappointed.

In addition, we would like to clarify that many poor students who originally applied to the Scholarship Unified Review Committee have recently been approved by the committee, which has requested that our newspaper's scholarship fund provide assistance, totaling 370 people. As our aim is to help students, we have readily agreed. (Please refer to the lists in the Tai Lan section on the 22nd and 23rd).

Finally, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the donating readers!

### "It Is Surely About Rectifying Names"

— Leiting

"Rectifying names" seems to be an unshakable habit among famous scholars in our country. This is of course deeply influenced by the saying "If names are not correct, words are not in accordance," and the particularly important key lies in "words not being in accordance."

However, in the current society and country, where everything is abnormal, can the work of rectifying names and making words in accordance achieve good results? This is, of course, a big question mark in the eyes of discerning people!

For example, from the government's policy guidelines to the regulations of general social organizations, which one, which item, which aspect is not logical and reasonable? Not only are "words in accordance," but "names are also correct." However, when it comes to implementation, how many are nominally existent but practically dead?

However, the thoughts and purposes of most "name rectifiers" are still focused on "rectifying names."

For example, the rise in prices, the increase in taxes, or anything else related to the increase in costs; the simplest thing to say is that prices are rising. But some people think that the word "price increase" is too stimulating, too obvious, and has the suspicion of inciting price fluctuations. Thus, a more moderate "adjustment" is produced to adjust it.

In this way, the rather provocative word "price increase" is no longer written or spoken by anyone. Thus, although the newspapers are full of records of adjustments, and everywhere is a cry for adjustments, the "name rectifiers" turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, as if the world is truly peaceful. Because nothing has increased in price.

However, in the past two years, although ordinary people have not been stimulated by price increases, they have long been unable to bear the gifts of adjustments, and they feel that adjustments seem to be more terrifying than price increases. However, the thoughts and purposes of most "name rectifiers" are still focused on "rectifying names."

For example, recently, teachers and staff in private primary and secondary schools, unable to bear the large "adjustments" of all prices, and unable to survive, have requested an increase in × fees (because officials do not allow the use of names such as tuition or miscellaneous fees, and the primary and secondary school associations have not determined a name, so they dare not act without authorization and use × to replace it). The official's response is: first, they express deep sympathy for the plight of the teachers and staff; second, the city treasury is depleted and cannot help; third, × fees can be increased, but names such as tuition or miscellaneous fees cannot be used, and the multiple cannot be specified; fourth, the amount to be collected should be negotiated by the school authorities and the students' parents.

For the first two points, these officials, even in the midst of their busy official duties, still pay attention to this group of small teachers struggling on the starvation line. I think they have nothing to say except to be extremely grateful. The concern for the burdens of the students' parents in the fourth point shows the authorities' consideration of maintaining education and caring for the people's sufferings, which makes people even more admiring. But for the intention of the third point, one cannot help but feel perplexed.

Because students are seeking knowledge, the fees they pay should be called tuition; schools are places for teaching, so the fees they collect should be called tuition; and the teachers' remuneration (from the ancient system, respecting teachers) is stipulated to be paid from the tuition by the authorities, so it is also taking tuition. Since the fees increased this time are for the teachers and staff to take, it can be said to be preventing unscrupulous school owners from enriching themselves, which is understandable. As for not allowing the use of the word "tuition," putting down the books, it is truly "the higher I look up, the more lofty it seems!"

In fact, whether it is called a respect-teacher fee, a professional development fee, or even a donation, the biggest purpose of the poor teachers is just to hope to get a little more money to sell their lives to maintain their minimum living for a few more days, that is all. On the parents' side, no matter what it is called, they still have to take out some money, that is all. Eight taels is still half a catty.

However, the "name rectifiers" are still focused on "rectifying names"!

"It is surely about rectifying names?" This is the way of the sage.

This humble one is not clever, and respectfully accepts the teaching!

### On Abhorring Evil

— Wu Yong

Mencius said, "If the virtuous are honored and the capable are employed, and outstanding talents are in positions, then all the scholars in the world will be pleased and willing to stand in their court." This is of course the case, there's no need to mention it. However, I personally believe that Mencius said this to the ruler, not to "all the scholars in the world." Therefore, it does not contain the meaning of asking people to hide their light and bide their time. Mencius did not say that the "standing in their court" of scholars must be conditional on the superiors "honoring the virtuous and employing the capable, and outstanding talents being in positions." It should be known that if the ruler has already reached the point of "honoring the virtuous and employing the capable, and outstanding talents being in positions," then whether the scholars "are willing to stand in their court" is no longer important, and there is no need to emphasize it further.

According to Mencius, the personality of Bo Yi in ancient times was: "He would not serve a ruler who was not his ruler, nor befriend a friend who was not his friend; he would not stand in the court of evil people, nor speak with evil people; standing in the court of evil people and speaking with evil people was like sitting on charcoal with court clothes and a court hat; pushing the heart of abhorring evil, thinking of standing with the villagers; if his hat was not straight, he would leave with a worried look, as if about to flee." The spirit of Bo Yi, who cherishes his integrity and hates evil like an enemy, is admired by later generations. However, I think his "not befriending a friend who was not his friend, not standing in the court of evil people, not speaking with evil people," etc., are somewhat excessive. This kind of behavior is somewhat similar to what people now call "ostrichism" in a negative sense. Therefore, Mencius's comment is "Bo Yi is narrow." The reason why people are evil is that they have little contact with good people; "the court of evil people," as the name suggests, should mean that good people are not in the court. If good people retreat to the mountains and forests and do not compete with the world, the world will inevitably become more evil and things will become worse. In this way, the "goodness" of good people does not work on the evil of evil people, so why is there any value in having good people in the world? Therefore, only when there are evil people in the world is it all the more necessary for good people to put themselves in the ranks of the court.

Bo Yi's starving to death on Shouyang Mountain is worthy of our sympathy. But this is the inevitable result of "not speaking with evil people, not standing in the court of evil people." Regarding this point, the Biography of Marquis Wei Qi and Marquis Wu An in the Records of the Grand Historian says it most clearly: "...Therefore, Marquis Wei Qi was made chancellor, and Marquis Wu An was made grand commandant. Ji Fu congratulated Marquis Wei Qi and then mourned, saying: Your Lordship's temperament is fond of good and hates evil. Now good people praise Your Lordship, so you have become chancellor; but Your Lordship hates evil, and there are many evil people, and they will also slander Your Lordship; if Your Lordship can be tolerant, you will be lucky to last long, if you cannot, you will be removed by slander. Wei Qi did not listen." Marquis Wei Qi not only "liked good," but also firmly advocated "hating evil," and as a result, he was squeezed out by Marquis Wu An and ended up with the fate of being "abandoned in the market."

This kind of ending is of course not very interesting. This makes us think: what kind of position should a person take on "good" and "evil"? There are four possibilities. The first is: to like good and hate evil; the second is: to like good and not hate evil; the third is: to like evil and not hate good; and the fourth is: to like evil and hate good. The second and third paths have the advantage of being stable; to like evil and hate good, although it is good, it tends to be extreme, and there may be times when it does not work, because there are indeed "many evil people" in the world, but the degree may not be so severe, so it is in the same category as "liking good and hating evil," which is "out of touch with the times."

In my personal opinion, it is okay to like good and hate evil; but "liking good" is liking the goodness of others, and "hating evil" is hating one's own evil. If one embraces the attitude of liking the goodness of others and hating one's own evil and interacts with the present world, is it almost right?

### A Record of Buying Meat

— You Mo Jun

In the morning, I heard colleagues in the school talking about buying meat to eat. I wondered where the meat came from, and thought that the meager hourly wage earned by shouting until my throat was hoarse and racking my brains every day was only enough to eat a bowl of plain noodles, so where would the money come from to buy meat to eat? Isn't that ridiculous! To tell the truth, all the teachers and students in the school have been vegetarians for a long time; radish, vegetables, and tofu soup, it's always the same old tune every day. When we are hungry, we can comfort ourselves with "If you can bite on vegetable roots, you can do anything," but the vegetables have no oil, and even if they have oil, they can lubricate the intestines, but now the intestines have become "this road is blocked," and magnesium sulfate must be taken!

Where did the meat come from? It turned out that a school worker asked for leave to return to his hometown. It is said that his family slaughtered a pig, so he brought some pork to the school. The price is not expensive, only 16 yuan per catty in Gold Standard banknotes, which is really not expensive! Two days ago, I did know that spare ribs were 24 yuan per catty, and rump was 2 yuan more. A housewife told me personally that she went to the market and saw a piece of spare ribs in a butcher shop. The fat and lean meat looked really good. After weighing it, the price was 27 yuan in Gold Standard banknotes. She touched her body and only had 15 yuan, and in great disappointment, she had to give the spare ribs a glance and leave. Now, each catty of meat only costs 16 yuan, which is almost one-third cheaper than the price two days ago. Wouldn't it be a pity not to eat it? So everyone suggested "eating company," which was considered a meat meal.

A few days ago, I received a letter from my old friend Jiang Danshu, which contained the words "Our school must have 'porridge meals' every night, but actually nothing has happened." The words are humorous and sad. I don't know what thoughts will arise in his mind after reading this article.

### Recent Works by Xia An

— Ye Gongchuo

I once sold paintings of bamboo in Shanghai to grow bamboo, and wrote poems to record it. Now I have returned to my hometown and live in Dongshan, and I am planting bamboo again, and I often paint bamboo to exchange for rice. I will write this poem again.

Bamboo and Xia An seem to have an appointment, living in seclusion, empty and skillfully arranged. I knew early on that eating meat was not my business (I have not eaten meat for 26 years), and I still have a vacant mind as my teacher. Pine and cypress compete for firmness in the stream, thorns and bushes are no hindrance to making fences. After recovering from illness, I occasionally write and sell paintings, and three paths of string songs can be used for this.

Su Hui heard of a birthday memorial service

Turning his head, he truly left and will not return, his heroic light is uniquely visible from the cold ashes. Yi invaded the Little Odes and was difficult to abolish, and old spring solitary flowers only bloom on their own. The fire seems to be waiting for a time to come, and orchid grease is fighting to be treasured when there is no talent in the world. Who will continue the uninhibited sound of the South, gazing at the reeds and backtracking.

### A Record of Wu Dunzhai

— Chen Zuogao

During the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, famous scholars emerged from Wu Zhong. Among the anecdotes worth discussing, Mr. Wu Dunzhai should be mentioned. Mr. Wu's given name was Yusheng, his courtesy name was Weiru, and his literary name was Dunzhai. He was a Hanlin scholar in the Dingchou year. He was known for his integrity during his time as an official. Weng Tonghe admired him greatly, and the Wu Taishi mentioned repeatedly in his diary is him. When he was still a boy, his father took him to the family ancestral hall because he was losing Li Zi, and his studies were very strict, so he was not allowed to be too relaxed. When he was just 20 years old, he passed the provincial examination and became a jinshi in succession. At the age of 24, he entered the Imperial Academy and served as the chief examiner of Guangdong, Hubei, and Fujian provinces. He and Shen Zengzhi (Meisou) served as the chief examiner of Guangdong at the same time. Kang Youwei of Nanhai, whose registered name was Zuyi, came from his tutelage. For decades, he respected him as a teacher and never waned. During the Hundred Days' Reform, Mr. Wu was released as the Sichuan Educational Commissioner. Wu Xia, such as the Zhang Yi Kun brothers, were all recruited into his staff, and they even served him as their teacher. Later, Zhang Ying was recommended by Mr. Wu to Shen Qiquan, his wife's uncle, for a special economic examination. He was particularly insightful in identifying and promoting talents. During the Qing Dynasty, he served as the Left Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, entered the Grand Council, and served as the Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, known as an honest and famous official. At that time, old officials such as Liang Shiyi, Guan Genglin, and Ye Gongchuo were all his close friends and followers.

After the Republic of China, he deeply understood the meaning of the revolution and never boasted of being a Qing loyalist. Instead, he lived in Qingdao, studying inscriptions diligently. Every year, the income from calligraphy was used to support relatives and friends who had no one to tell. His calligraphy obtained the rules of Yan Zhenqing and the methods of Song Huizong, becoming a great master of the late Qing Dynasty. He could also identify calligraphy, painting, and bronze inscriptions from ancient times, being exquisite and subtle, and was respected by the art world. When he passed through Shanghai in the Yimao year, he stayed at the Yipinxiang Hotel. One day, he met a young man holding a silk fan with the words "So-and-so Tongnian" written on it, signed by Dunzhai. Mr. Wu jokingly asked who the name above was. He said it was his grandfather's name, and that the writer had passed away many years ago. Mr. Wu smiled and said: "I am Dunzhai." The young man left in embarrassment. Even at the age of seventy or more, he still watched three movies a day, walked leisurely, and his spirit was undiminished. His heroic and humorous style was like this. In the Yihai year, he reassigned the Deer Crying Odes, and in the Dingzhuang year (during the Anti-Japanese War), he rejoined the Qionglin Banquet, celebrating two grand events without holding them. Four years later, he died without illness in the island building, leaving behind two sons, Zengzhi and Zengqin, who both graduated from special departments in Belgium and France.

The Wu family has been a family of scholars in Suzhou for generations. Wu Zhongjun (Songfu) and Wu Tingchen (Dihua), known as the Uncle and Nephew Zhuangyuan of Wu, were Mr. Wu's great-great-grandfathers. After Mr. Wu left the Imperial Academy after the Dingchou year, the diaries he wrote continued for 60 years without interruption. This grand masterpiece is extremely valuable for the anecdotes and allusions of the Tongzhi, Guangxu, and Xuantong periods of the Qing Dynasty. It can be compared to Li Yueman and Song Chan. It is a pity that it has not been published. Dai Biaoyuan's preface repeatedly mentioned the gathering of Wu Xia figures, which further confirms this.
