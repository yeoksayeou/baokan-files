If the President can be successfully elected before noon, the Vice President will be elected in the afternoon; otherwise, it will be postponed to the next preparatory meeting. The Provisional Secretariat is extremely cautious in handling the election. According to staff members of the Procedural Affairs Section, only Yuan members and staff members handling meeting venue affairs are allowed to enter the venue. Newspaper reporters will only have the opportunity to observe from a distance in the balcony. This regulation has been advertised by the Provisional Secretariat in the Central Daily News, but because no such regulations existed for the National Assembly elections, reporters still hope to enter the venue.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Regarding Fu Sinian's non-participation in the election for Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Hu Shi wrote to Wang Shaolun on May 6th to explain. The original letter stated: "Mr. Shaolun, I was informed this afternoon that some members of the Legislative Yuan wanted to nominate Fu Mengzhen (Sinian) to run for Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. At that time, I told you my humble opinion. This afternoon, I informed Mr. Xia Zuoming, the Acting Director of the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica, of this matter, and his opinion was entirely consistent with mine. He had seen the letter that Mr. Fu Mengzhen sent to the former legislator, Rui Guifu, saying that he did not want to be elected as a legislator. Later, I saw Mengzhen's original letter dated March 11th of this year, in which he said, "My district is in the hands of the Communist Party, and they cannot elect me. Even if they do, I will never do it. I explained this to the Shandong authorities last year." Since Mengzhen has expressed this clearly, I hope that you will convey this to your other friends and decide to cancel the plan you told me about this afternoon. I dare not fail to report the true situation to you, and I respectfully wish you well. Sincerely, Hu Shi, May 6th."

### Shanghai Municipal Assembly Speaker Pan and Others

Send a Letter to the First Legislative Yuan Representatives Expressing Their Views on the Election of the President and Vice President

[Reported by this newspaper] Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly, and Jun Yi, President of Fudan University, recently sent an open letter to all members of the First Legislative Yuan, expressing their views on the election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. The contents of the original letter are excerpted below:

To the Honorable Members of the First Legislative Yuan,

With the closing of the National Assembly and the commencement of constitutional government, this is truly an unprecedentedly great era for our Chinese nation to reform and revitalize, to inspire and strive forward, and to renew the people. The election of President Chiang as the first President and Li as his Vice President is a cause for national celebration that leadership has been found. During the transition period, the Legislative Yuan, as the organ representing the will of the people, bears great responsibilities and powers, and the selection of its President and Vice President must be carefully considered. Now, opinions differ and debates are rampant, and we fear that the esteemed members will act on momentary emotions, thereby delaying the national plan. This is why we are deeply concerned and cannot help but speak out. According to the common practice of parliaments in various countries, the selection of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker is usually decided by the majority party itself, and members with the majority party affiliation invariably vote according to this decision. However, the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang has already decided on the candidates, and the esteemed members, regardless of whether they are members of the Kuomintang, are deliberately acting strangely and making bizarre arguments, calling it a "free election." This is truly a strange phenomenon in the political history of countries in transition. We fear that once a bad precedent is set, party integrity will be completely lost, and future parliamentary politics will inevitably suffer the endless consequences of this. Moreover, according to reports, some people are advocating for Mr. Fu Sinian to be appointed as Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. In our humble opinion, Mr. Fu is still abroad and may not have personally reported for duty, let alone attended meetings of the Legislative Yuan. Strictly speaking, whether he is a legislator is still a question. This is the first point. The President and Vice President are the moderators of the Legislative Yuan meetings. The person must be honest, generous, fair, and broad-minded, with a heart like water, accommodating diverse opinions. Mr. Fu often insists on his own views, which is acceptable for academic discussions, but not for presiding over parliamentary meetings. This is the second point. Mr. Fu is currently the Director of the Academia Sinica and is therefore a current official. We have not seen him formally request and be granted resignation, so he cannot be immediately recognized as a legislator. Without asking whether Mr. Fu himself agrees to resign from his official position and assume the position of legislator, hastily using his name to participate in the election of the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan is clearly an unconstitutional act. This is the third point. We have been serving in cultural and educational undertakings for many years and have either been old friends with Mr. Fu or admired his reputation. We believe that there are many ways for Mr. Fu to serve the country, and those of us who respect Mr. Fu should not place him in a situation that violates the law and the constitution. Therefore, we dare to forget our ignorance and offer our humble opinion, hoping that the esteemed members will abide by the law and respect the constitution.

Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Yi, Hu Wenyao, Hu Dunfu, Shen Sumin, Jiang Zhicheng, Fan Huiguo, Yuan Zhe, Zhou Shang, Hu Shuyi, Tang Yan'er, Xu Xinyu, Liu Tuo, Yu Wen, Yin Weikang, Zhang Yiqu, Wang Zhugu, Wang Jinshan, and others respectfully.

### Chen Lifu Holds a Tea Party

To Host Legislators from Various Provinces, Explaining His Motives for Running for Vice President of the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] Chen Lifu, a candidate for Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, hosted a tea party for legislators from various provinces at 3:30 PM on the 16th at the National Assembly Hall. More than two hundred people attended, including Kong Geng, Zou Shuwen, Li Boshen, Rao Fenghuang, Chen Bosheng, Wang Bingjun, Xiao Zheng, Lai Lian, Zhang Daodang, Zhang Zhijiang, Du Guangxun, Cheng Tianfang, Jiang Yiping, Hu Jianzhong, and Yang Buping. Gu Zhenggang, Ma Qijun, Fang Zhi, and Chen Fangxian were also invited to attend. Chen immediately stood up and spoke, explaining his motives for running and his views on reform. He said that now that the country has entered the constitutional period from the period of political tutelage, although he studied engineering, he is willing to follow the esteemed gentlemen and engage in constitutional work. Therefore, he came out to run for legislator. He originally had no intention of running for Vice President, but the President proposed it, and the Central Standing Committee passed a resolution that he, as a member of the Kuomintang and a person responsible for organization, had to accept the party's decision. Everyone is a comrade in arms, and he hopes that everyone will unanimously support Mr. Sun and himself in the election on the 17th. He is determined to follow everyone and assist Mr. Sun. Chen then briefly explained some of the criticisms against him by some comrades, saying that some comrades have made many criticisms and insults against him, but today, in front of the portrait of the Premier and in front of all the comrades, he can ask his conscience and feel no guilt. In the past, he has made many suggestions regarding the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, especially the economic policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood, but they cannot be completed with just a few slogans and must first establish a good system. As for the criticism that the past organization was not sufficient, the comrades nominated by the party in this election were accepted by the voters. Finally, Chen also said: Regarding some shortcomings in the past, he does not want to argue too much. He hopes that everyone can work together and be jointly responsible for party affairs in the future. After Chen's speech, more than ten legislators, including Li Boshen, Kong Geng, and Chen Zifeng, spoke one after another, mostly saying that they would abide by the party's resolution, obey the President's leadership, and elect Chen as Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

The number of these factories is increasing, and if the supply of rayon cannot be increased, a large number of workers will lose their jobs, making the employment situation even more serious.

Incident of Banning Reporters from the Football Field: Hao Gengsheng Apologizes Solemnly
Accepts Demands, Storm Calmed
[Our Report] During the Army vs. Police football match the day before yesterday, the organizing committee unreasonably discriminated against reporters, prohibiting them from entering the field, which aroused the indignation of reporters from various local and out-of-town newspapers covering the National Games. They jointly lodged a protest. Yesterday, Hao Gengsheng, the Director-General of the organizing committee, issued a statement on this matter, saying: "Since the opening of this National Games, the organizing committee has tried its best to facilitate the entry of reporters from various newspapers for coverage and photography within the possible scope. However, for the Army vs. Police football match held at the Athletics Field at 4:00 PM on the 15th, as it was the key to deciding the championship, the emotions of both sides were extremely tense. In order to prevent unexpected disputes, the organizing committee and the military and police authorities, in addition to having military and police personnel from this city responsible for monitoring the situation on the field, temporarily prohibited personnel not directly related to the game from entering the competition field, including registered members of the organizing committee from the referee, field, publicity, and other groups who should have been on the field for work during various sports competitions. There were no exceptions. As a result, the same level of convenience was not provided for newspaper reporters and photographers to enter the field. This was purely a temporary expedient measure, and it was limited only to the final football match before the closing of the Games. The organizing committee expresses its deep regret that reporters from various newspapers were unable to fully enjoy the freedom of coverage during that match, and sincerely hopes that members of the press will understand the organizing committee's difficulties in maintaining order at the venue and avoiding unexpected disputes at the time. We would be extremely grateful." Yesterday afternoon, reporters from various newspapers held a meeting and felt that Hao's public statement was not satisfactory. They decided to demand that Hao apologize publicly orally, and solemnly apologize in writing, and admit that the attitude towards reporters the day before was in violation of the Games regulations. If Hao did not accept, all reporters decided to abandon coverage of the closing news of the National Games. This request was made by six representatives to Hao on the west command platform before the closing ceremony began. As a result, Hao accepted all of the requests, repeatedly expressing his "twelve thousand points from the heart" apologies in front of the microphone under public scrutiny, and was willing to publish an apology advertisement in today's newspapers. He expressed extreme shame for the repeated violations of regulations that occurred during the Games. He also said, "The smooth progress of the National Games depends entirely on the reporting and promotion of the press. I am willing to guarantee in my position as the person in charge of this session that there will never be any hindrance to the freedom of the press in the next National Games, and reporters will be given more convenience." The reporters from various newspapers were satisfied with this, and a storm was resolved. The closing ceremony was able to proceed on time.

Small Football Performance Match: Zhejiang Defeats Shanghai Three Goals to Nil
[Our Report] Only Shanghai and Zhejiang participated in the small football performance match. Yesterday at 10:30 AM, the two teams met at Yì Garden. The Shanghai team appeared with the following lineup:
Jin Cai, Fei Youliang, Liu Yinxing, Chen Yuanji, Li Yao, Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe
The Zhejiang team was an incarnation of the Two Roads Team, with the following lineup:
Liao Xiong, Yue Renxiao, Wu Jiabang, Lu Bingsheng, Xiao Ziwen, Lu Qingxiang, Lin Dianyi
The match started at 10:30 AM sharp. Initially, neither team put on a good performance. After nine minutes, Lin Dianyi of Zhejiang took the lead and scored, taking a 1-0 lead. Zhejiang's coordination was tacit, and Xiao Yuwen, Lu Qingxiang, and others frequently invaded the center, but they were stopped by Dong Jincai of Shanghai. Although Fei Youliang, Li Yao, and others of the Shanghai team had brilliant performances, Zhejiang's Xiong's iron gate was tightly closed, and they could not achieve success. After a long period of chaos, nothing was gained. At 25 minutes, Lu Qingxiang of Zhejiang, single-handedly broke through the defense. Jincai's long-range reception failed, and Lu Xiang diverted the tiger from the mountain, scoring a goal effortlessly. At 30 minutes, Lu Bingsheng left the field due to a leg injury and was replaced by Zhang Jie. The first half ended with Zhejiang leading 2-0.
After the break, Shanghai replaced Jia Youliang with Zhu Shunfu and Han Longhai with Chen Longquan, determined to strengthen and invade on a large scale. Unfortunately, Zhejiang's rear defense was strong, and they could not penetrate deeply. Enemy cavalry roamed within Shanghai's defense. Thrilling scenes occurred frequently. Li Yao of Shanghai made a long shot, and Longquan made a header, but neither broke the net. Afterwards, the morale of both teams declined. In the last minute, Lu Bingsheng suddenly obtained Ādòu, directly entering the empty gate on a solo effort. The game ended with Zhejiang defeating Shanghai 3-0.

American Sprinter Patton Breaks World Record in 100-Yard Dash
[United Press, Fresno, California, 15th] Patton, a sprinter from the University of Southern California, broke the world record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.3 seconds in a special program at the West Coast Games held here on the 15th. Three timing watches were used at the finish line, one resulting in 9.3 seconds, and the other two in 9.4 seconds. The wind was weak, so the results were not affected. The conference officials announced that this was an "official" result and would be sent to various international sports organizations for recognition. If recognized by various countries, Patton may become the fastest person in the world. The old record was held by seven people, including Simpson, Mayo, Weigauf, McCleave, African American Owens, Jeffery, and Davis, with a time of 9.4 seconds. Patton equaled the record of 9.4 seconds last year, but was only recognized on Friday. In the race on the 15th, Patton only led Raibee from Panama, a student at the University of California, Los Angeles, by a few inches at the finish line. Raibee also tied the world record with 9.4 seconds. Losing in one place but gaining in another, Raibee tied Owens' world record in the 100-meter final with 10.2 seconds.

International Volleyball Friendly: China Wins Big Against Western Union
The International Courageous Volleyball Friendly was held at the Municipal Stadium on Shaanxi South Road, starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. China sent the Police Team, one of the three volleyball co-champions of the National Games, while Western Union was represented by the Soviet team from the Western Youth League. Western Union was accustomed to American-style six-player volleyball and was relatively unfamiliar with the Far Eastern nine-player system. The referees were Chen De and Huang Huazhu. China won the first game 21-19. In the second game, China won again 21-8. In the third game, China won the third game 21-16, defeating Western Union straight sets.
The second act adopted the American six-player system, still with the Police versus Soviet Union. The American system was not familiar, and the performance was awkward. Referee Chen De. In the second game, Western Union won.

80-Meter Women's Hurdles: Time of 11.6 Seconds
Amazing Record by British Athlete
[United Press, Conventry, England, 15th] British Olympian Gardner set a new record of 11.6 seconds in the 80-meter hurdles today against the wind, reducing her old record by two-tenths of a second. The lady also won the 100-meter flat race champion with 12.5 seconds.

Our Newspaper Reporter: The Stadium Suddenly Turns into an Empty Valley
How Bleak the Closing Ceremony Was
When Will the Song of Farewell Be Sung Again
A Song of Parting, Sadly Dismayed
By Our Newspaper Reporter Yuan Wenzhong
Those who participated in the opening ceremony must have found yesterday's closing ceremony unbearably bleak. The east and north sides of the stands, which had been crowded with tens of thousands of people several times, were empty, with hardly a figure to be seen. The sound waves transmitted from the microphone on the west command platform echoed greatly on the east command platform, clearly audible, making people feel as if they were in an "empty valley." Some of the athletes from various places had already returned, some had dispersed, and the number of people had decreased a lot. After entering the field, each team's flag circled only half a lap before standing still. The team banners of various colors waved in the wind, seeming even more beautiful in the bleak mood. Among them, the Guizhou team held theirs the highest, and the United Logistics team held theirs the lowest.
Several members of the Sichuan-Kang Tibetan tourism group came onto the command platform. They were all wearing black cassocks, with prayer beads hanging in front and behind their chests, and their heads wrapped in black cloth, with a towering pointed horn exposed on their foreheads. The Shanghai people called it "growing horns on the forehead," but unexpectedly, they actually saw the reality. A great commotion arose on the command platform, with everyone vying to see this strange dress.
Mayor Wu looked at his watch twice during Minister Zhu's speech, and whispered something to Director-General Hao, probably saying that it was getting late and he would waive his own speech.
When the awards began, Taiwan, which won the first place in men's competition, came up to receive the award first. Someone shouted loudly from the crowd, "Long live Taiwan!"
The types of prizes were magnificent, including silver cups, silver shields, pennants, radios, bicycles, and huge portraits of Chairman Chiang.
When the police team received the award, Director Yu Shuping personally came forward, smiling.
The distribution of prizes for the three co-champions was decided by drawing lots. The awardees each drew one of the three bamboo sticks, a bit like drawing lots in the City God Temple, and a bit like gambling with the people selling rice wine.
After each team took their prizes, they were placed on the ground in front of the team. Many spectators rushed into the field to watch, and the order began to become chaotic. Later, even the hawkers selling tea eggs and spiced beef came in.
In the twilight, the flag of the conference was slowly lowered. "There is no banquet in the world that doesn't end." A scene of prosperity was like fleeting clouds. I would like to say to the athletes from all over the country who came from afar: In the future, may the elegant demeanor spread, and the future be cherished. I wish you to create a new record in the next session.

Visiting Northeast Representative Liu Shuyou
[Our Newspaper Special] In the closing of the National Games, the reporter made a special trip to the athletes' dormitory of the China Training Corps on Shuǐdiàn Road to pay a visit. The athletes' residence, the Zhongzheng Hall and the monks' ritual hall, were mostly empty, and those who had not yet left were also busy preparing to return. The dormitory appeared cold and empty, which, compared with the hustle and bustle of the past ten days, made everyone inevitably feel unbearably bleak.
Three-quarters of the Zhejiang athletes had already left, leaving only a very small number of representatives to visit relatives and take care of personal affairs. The athletes from other units were sparsely scattered in the rooms, rolling up their bedding and tidying their luggage.
The rooms were cluttered, with scraps of paper and cloth scattered all over the floor. The Taiwan athletes' rooms had extra large bamboo baskets for holding watermelons, but they were already empty.
Inside the dormitory of the Northeast athletes in Zhongzheng Hall, the reporter discovered a delicate parrot next to the bed of their table tennis representative, Liu Shuyou. It had green feathers and a red beak, and was verdant and endearing. He had spent 1,900 [currency unit not specified] on it in Wǔmǎ Road. He said: He had never seen such a lovely bird in the Northeast, and he wanted to take it back to his hometown and teach it to speak Northeastern dialect. To buy this parrot, he had sold his beloved swimming watch.
The accompanying photographer wanted to take a photo of this little parrot. Liu Shuyou seemed flattered and extremely proud. He insisted that taking a photo of just the bird was not interesting, so he moved all his belongings out: basketball, volleyball, table tennis, bayonet, gun, sportswear signed by Mei Lanfang, and a white silk scarf and handkerchief with the autographs of athletes from various units, even worn-out shoes and smelly socks were moved out, piled up on the ground.
When taking the photo, he specifically instructed: "Be sure to photograph the three characters of Mei Lanfang." He also said: "Tell me when you take the photo, I want to make an expression." Liu Shuyou's every move was abrupt and excessive, too strange. Out of curiosity, the reporter decided to talk to him to find out what was going on. According to him, he was a representative from Jinzhou, Northeast, and participated entirely at his own expense. He knew everything about all kinds of sports and was proficient in everything. He had a time of over 11.9 seconds in the 100-meter sprint, and had won a championship in table tennis once, and countless second places. He lost as soon as he entered the field this time because he was used to playing with hard balls in the Northeast, and Shanghai played with soft balls. What about the other competitions? The Northeast team leader did not allow him to participate. He had a bellyful of grievances with nowhere to express them.
Liu is currently in charge of intelligence in the police affairs section of the Jinzhou Railway Police Department. When he mentioned his background, he said that he had a bellyful of complaints that could not be expressed in a single sentence. He also said that in addition to sports, he was proficient in photography, business, singing... and that he could do everything.
The more Liu spoke, the happier he became. One of the Northeast athletes who lived with him secretly told the reporter that he was a bit mentally disturbed.
After careful inquiry, it was learned that Liu Shuyou was intelligent, quick-witted, physically strong, and full of ideals. He was unwilling to adapt to the environment, but reality gave him setbacks everywhere. After excessive stimulation, his nerves inevitably became a little disturbed. (Xù Cái)

Grain War in the Northeast: What Are People Focusing On?
[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] Everyone in the Northeast is concerned about the evolution of the war. The tense atmosphere caused by the loss of Liaoyang, Anshan, and Yingkou in southern Liaoning, the retreat in Jilin, and the breakthrough in Siping has dissipated. Everyone is now focusing their attention on the restoration of the Běiníng Road and the security of key cities such as Shěncháng.
What the people of Northeast China are even more concerned about is the grain issue, whether in government-controlled areas or in Communist-controlled areas. Whether ordinary people or soldiers, the first question asked is often about "grain" before any greetings are exchanged. Fluctuations in grain prices and the availability of grain directly affect everyone's nerves. It could even be said that the current war in the Northeast is essentially a grain war. When there is a sufficient supply of grain, there will be a way to obtain soldiers and boost morale.

Energetic Struggle
The Northern Army Destroys Transportation - The government-controlled area's disruption of transportation, occupation of villages and secondary towns, and encirclement of large cities are all tactics used in the "grain war." The Communist army's search for and plundering of stored grain in towns and villages are also tactics used in the "grain war." As for "launching spring plowing," its purpose is even more obvious. Currently, the cities still in the hands of the Nationalists include Shenyang, Changchun, Jinzhou, Fushun, Benxi, Tieling, Xinmin, and Liaozhong. Taking Shenyang as an example, the agricultural areas within a hundred li range south to the Taizi River, east to Fushun and Benxi, north to Tieling, and west to Xinmin are limited. Even in a peaceful and prosperous year, the harvest would be difficult to provide enough food for the nearly two million people in Shenyang. Moreover, the seedlings have not yet been planted, and the spring plowing period of war is about to break out!
Currently, the Northeast military and political authorities are actively reorganizing and replenishing their troops on one hand, and are even more actively seeking solutions to the "grain war" on the other hand. The latter includes opening and repairing the Shen-Jin Highway, planning the Shen-Jin air route, strengthening the Shen-Ping and Shen-Qing air routes, handling agricultural loans to launch spring plowing, and purchasing grain with the army, all of which are progressing at full speed. Deputy Director of the Government Affairs Office Luo Zhuoying and Shenyang Mayor Dong Wenqi have also condescended to go to the countryside to launch spring plowing, which shows the authorities' efforts in the "grain war."

Going to the Countryside to See Spring Plowing
The reporter spent nearly ten days visiting villages within eighty li of Shenyang to observe spring plowing. In Jiangnan, it should be a time of blooming flowers and lush greenery, but in the Northeast, it is still chilly. The day before yesterday, Changchun in northern Manchuria had snowfall, and the northern parts of Hanyang in southern Manchuria still had a strong cold. Although not many people were wearing leather coats, most were still wearing cotton clothes. Eight or nine out of ten Nationalists soldiers were still wearing cotton military uniforms. If it weren't for the fresh branches of green willows swaying in the wind, people would have a feeling of late autumn. Even in typical rural areas, there is no vibrant scene of green rice seedlings filling the fields. Farmers' main work is still loosening the soil and transporting manure. Due to the Communist army's plunder, the number of livestock in rural areas has been reduced by at least two-thirds. The task of transporting manure, which was previously done by horses, is now done by human labor. The fields passed by the reporter by train and on foot were mostly evenly stacked with mounds of yellow-black manure. In several villages, pigs were slaughtered to comfort the troops stationed there to help with spring plowing. They often told the Nationalist army about the slaughter only after it was done, so that the latter could not even refuse the comfort. The people of the Northeast are simple, honest, and sincere, even though the endless artillery battles linger in their minds.
However, it must be said that no matter how serious the grain shortage is, the authorities will not abandon it. Relevant agencies are busy with meetings and discussing countermeasures, such as increasing agricultural loans, strengthening air transportation, relaxing domestic remittance limits, stopping the purchase of grain (military grain will rely entirely on air transportation), and accelerating reclamation. Measures or plans are emerging one after another, although they have not yet been able to bring down the high grain prices.

A Group in Distress
The people in the Communist-controlled areas, unable to bear the oppression of the Communist army, bring their old and young to Shenyang, which shows that the people's hearts are available. However, resettling and relieving them is also a problem. Even the people of Shenyang who have homes to return to have to drink thin porridge and eat bean cakes. With the exception of a few special cases, it is difficult for outsiders to have a more comfortable life. Although the "exiled provincial governments" (such as Liaobei, Andong, and Songjiang) have been reduced to one room, their officials are working hard to deal with the exiled students gathered in front of the "provincial government." If they are introduced for further study, the universities and middle schools in Shenyang are also brewing plans to move to Tianjin and Beijing. Those who do not move cannot accommodate so many people. If they are introduced to occupations, the institutions are conducting layoffs. Relying on relatives and friends or selling clothes is the most practical approach. The badges of "Changbai Normal School" once shone brightly in Siping, but now they are breathing in the dust-filled Northern Market. Old things cannot be sold for money. Even if the entire family fortune is sold, it can only be exchanged for ten or eight catties of sorghum rice. Qipao and coats that have smelled perfume on noble ladies can only become sacrifices for their owners to have three or five tons of porridge. Officials' wives are talking about "flying," and people who set up clothing stalls are also talking about flying. The skinny pretend to be fat, and everyone understands each other.

Dadao and Broadaxe
The eyes of the people of Shenyang: one focuses on the high grain prices, and the other focuses on the impending war situation. Expanding grain sources and reinforcing troops are of course important, but refreshing the style is even more important. Although branch reforms are already brewing and underway, what the current situation needs is thorough reform. Employing private individuals, cultivating factions, and pursuing selfish interests still exist in the military and political institutions and troops in the Northeast. In particular, the recent collusion between grain administration officials and grain merchants has left the deepest impression on the people of the Northeast. The Northeast authorities have not taken a drastic approach to reforming the style. It is worth pointing out here, and demanding that they improve as soon as possible!

Incredibly Low Land Prices: Highest Price 50,000 Per Mu, Lowest Less Than a Bowl of Noodles
[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 10th] In the days before the change of mayor in Zhū City, 28 plots of public land were sold, covering an area of more than 144 mu. The buyers were mostly important officials of the provincial and municipal institutions, totaling 54 people. The municipal government received a total of more than 38 million [currency unit not specified], and the land prices were shockingly low. For example, the square in front of the police station near the Huǒ Cross, the busiest area, and the public land adjacent to the South China Road, the prosperous commercial area of the city, have all been sold. The highest land price was 50,000 per mu, and the lowest was less than a bowl of Chángwàng noodles (25,000). According to the reporter's investigation at the Land Administration Section of the Municipal Government, the initiators were the director of the Guizhou Office of the Yún Guì Supervisory Envoy's Office and a certain legislator. This has aroused extreme dissatisfaction from the provincial and municipal councils and the general public, who believe that the disposal of public land should be in accordance with Article 25 of the Land Law, "Without the consent of the people's organs in the jurisdiction and the approval of the Executive Yuan, it shall not be disposed of or negotiated, burdened or leased for a period exceeding ten years." The sale of public land by the Guiyang Municipal Government this time did not complete the legal procedures in advance. No matter what kind of people the buyers are, they are illegally obtained. The municipal government's unauthorized sale has the suspicion of violating the law and favoritism. This kind of discussion has spread from mouth to mouth in recent days and has become the first major event after Mr. Gu Zhengling and Mr. Zhang Zhizhong took over as provincial and municipal governments. The Zhū City press has visited Mr. Gu and Mr. Zhang one after another. The result is that both of them unanimously stated that they should solve the problem carefully under legal and reasonable conditions. The Municipal Council held a temporary tea party for all councilors at 3:00 PM on the 8th to invite Mayor Zhang and the head of the relevant section to attend and report on the situation. The councilors unanimously agreed that the sale of public land by the Municipal Government this time was illegal and should not be recognized. Fortunately, this was all done by the previous provincial and municipal governments and has nothing to do with the new provincial and municipal authorities. Therefore, they unanimously proposed to request the new Mayor Zhang to never issue any certificates of ownership to any buyers to avoid further complications. It is said that this case will be handled by the Municipal Council sending a letter to the Municipal Government based on this opinion, and the Municipal Government will ask the Provincial Government for instructions, because the Municipal Government sold the public land this time with the approval of the former Provincial Government. How it will unfold in the future is still difficult to predict. Since many of the buyers are prominent figures, whether Chairman Gu's tough style can be thoroughly implemented is a major test.

Solving the Power Shortage in the Jiangnan Area: Developing Hydropower in the Upper Reaches of the Qián Táng River
[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 12th] The Yangtze River Delta, including the cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, is densely populated and has thriving industries. It is the essence of Jiangnan. Industry requires mechanical power, but during the Anti-Japanese War, the power industry in the Jiangnan area was severely damaged. Taking Shanghai, the economic center of China, as an example, its pre-war power capacity was about 260,000 kilowatts, but now it is only 130,000 kilowatts. Zhejiang had more than 40 power plants before the war, but now only 23 thermal power plants and 2 small power plants remain, with a total power capacity of only 23,000 kilowatts, which is certainly not enough for industrial needs. However, since the victory, the smoke of war has filled the land, and the wars in the Northeast and North China have hindered the southward transport of coal from the north. Even if we want to increase thermal power generation, we lack fuel. Therefore, to develop industry in Jiangnan and build the prosperity of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, we can only seek hydropower generation under the current conditions. As early as last spring, the Qiántáng River Survey Office of the National Hydropower Engineering Administration of the Resources Committee was established in Hangzhou, hoping to obtain the industrial needs of Jiangnan and solve the current power shortage from the hydropower of the Qiántáng River. The result was very satisfactory. They surveyed and determined six locations in the upper reaches of the Qiántáng River that could be developed, with a power generation capacity of 217,000 kilowatts. Other small-scale power generation locations that can be used locally are not included.
In the past two years, Chairman Shen Honglie has devoted himself to agricultural water conservancy in Zhejiang. In order to strengthen construction undertakings, this year is designated as the year of construction in Zhejiang. The hydropower generation project in the upper reaches of the Qiántáng River can not only help the development of industries in the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, but also passively reduce rural water disasters and actively electrify rural areas to make them more modern. This is truly a beautiful ideal. Chairman Shen is of course very concerned about this and regards it as one of the two largest and most valuable undertakings in Zhejiang, along with the planning of the Háng (Hangzhou) Yǒng (Yongjia) Railway. However, in the current era of all undertakings waiting to be revived and continuous destruction, the problem of funding is always a fatal obstacle when discussing construction. Moreover, the policy of the former central government was to focus on the revival and construction of South China. Therefore, the central government intended to build the Mǐn (Jiangxi's Guangze) Xià (Fujian's Xiamen) Railway, which has not yet been surveyed, but had no intention of building the Háng Yǒng Road, which has already been surveyed, or restoring the Háng Yǒng section of the Hù Háng Yǒng Railway. However, the central government was quite interested in developing hydropower in the upper reaches of the Qiántáng River. According to the Zhejiang Provincial Government Construction Department Officer Pi Zuóqióng, who spoke to reporters, he has had several long talks with Director Weng Wenhao of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Resources Committee and the Ministry of Water Resources, and they both expressed their agreement. The funds can be drawn from US aid, but only those with less cost and more power generation can be selected for development first. Under this principle, it was decided to develop Jiēkǒu first. Because it concerns the development of the entire Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, it will be jointly developed by four units: the Resources Committee, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government.
Jiēkǒu is located on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui, only 25 li away from the border of Anhui Province, next to the largest tributary of the Qiántáng River - the Lǜ River (namely the Xī'ān River). The riverbed has a drop of 0.11%, and the catchment area is 6700 square kilometers. The terrain is suitable for building high dams. The average flow rate in 1934 was approximately 150 C.M.S. If a dam is built to raise the water level by 80 meters and 100 C.M.S. is used, the power generation can reach 80,000 kilowatts, which is three times the existing power in Zhejiang. The Tánggōng Bureau, which is responsible for the design, has already prepared a plan to build a 180-meter-high dam across the river at the exit of Jiēkǒu Gorge. The middle of the dam will be converted into a 120-meter-wide spillway, with eight drainage pipes separately equipped with starting and stopping equipment to release water in large quantities before floods to allow the river to receive floods, reduce water disasters, and facilitate utilization. The power plant is located downstream, with two 40,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generators installed initially, and a location reserved for future expansion of the machine. To generate these 80,000 kilowatts of electricity, the required funds, from the cost of land acquisition and house relocation for the reservoir to civil engineering, electromechanical equipment, and management fees, interest, and unexpected expenses, total US$26,655,500. Only US$7.2 million needs to be purchased in foreign exchange to purchase hydroelectric machinery, and the rest of the materials can be paid in domestic currency in the domestic market, which is also greatly beneficial to domestic industry and the local economy.

A Friend Comes from America   Yi Jun

Yesterday, a friend of my father's came to visit us, having just returned from America. He took off from New York, day and night, rain or shine, and except for refueling three times along the way, didn't stop. He arrived in Shanghai in forty-eight hours, almost as fast as Sun Wukong's somersault cloud.

According to his observations in America, he felt that nature endows people with extreme equality; whether it's mountains, water, soil, rocks, grass, trees, insects, fish, animals, plants, minerals, climate, or weather, our country is exactly the same as America, with no difference. But they make the best use of people's talents, the land's resources, and the utility of things. For example, roads must be well-maintained, dikes are built with concrete and cement, and places with rapid currents are utilized for power generation. Crops, poultry, and livestock are experimented with using various methods, and breeds are improved every year.

He visited the house of the first President, Washington, which was simple and crude. He visited a museum and saw plows, rakes, shovels, pots, stoves, bowls, alms bowls, spinning wheels, and other tools from two hundred years ago, which were exactly the same as those used in China and Africa today, with no difference. We are two hundred years behind, still stuck in the eighteenth century.

In American cinemas, not only does no one talk, but you can't even hear a cough. The floor is covered with thick velvet carpets, so you can walk silently. The whole place is quiet, and only the movie is playing on the screen. Remembering this, I can't help but think of the current anti-spitting campaign in Shanghai. Those who advise against it keep advising, but if there's phlegm in your throat, you still have to spit it out. What is the reason for this? In my opinion, the first is the lack of sanitary habits, and the second is physical weakness and excess phlegm. If your body is strong and there is no phlegm in your throat, it would be difficult to cough or spit even if forced!

Newspaper vendors throw a pile of newspapers on the street and leave. Whoever wants to buy a newspaper puts three cents there and takes one.

The most admirable thing is their libraries in primary and secondary schools. The walls are lined with beautiful books. Readers don't need a library card or any procedures. They can browse automatically, and after reading, they put them back in place neatly. They can also take them home to read, but they must return them within a day. In fact, no one fails to return them on time, which is an incredible miracle!

The industrialization of America is even more astonishing. Just to mention two things: Once, he flew from New York to Boston, a distance of over a thousand miles. Looking down, he saw chimneys everywhere, stretching endlessly. Another time, he drove into the countryside for an inspection, and after traveling one or two hundred miles, he still saw tall buildings, concrete roads, and neon lights. He was surprised and asked, "Why haven't we reached the countryside yet?" The answer was, "We've already reached the countryside. This is the countryside!"

American farmers, as long as they don't give up on themselves, don't have to worry about making a living. Don't have money? The government automatically lends it to them. There are two types of loans: one is short-term, borrowed in the spring and repaid in the autumn, and the other is long-term, repaid in forty years. In a fixed area, the government regularly has someone patrol and inspect by car. If they encounter someone in poverty, they will handle this type of agricultural loan for them. If someone accepts an agricultural loan but doesn't engage in proper business, it will be unceremoniously taken back. Even in the countryside, transportation is convenient, and cars can pass by every household, so the government has a clear understanding of the situation of the people, and administrative efficiency is extremely high. In this situation, if you still "can't survive," it must be due to "self-inflicted misfortune."

My father's friend chatted with us for at least ten dull hours. The listeners were fascinated, their minds wandering to that country, but when they thought of the situation in their own country, they felt extremely ashamed!

Finally, I want to solemnly declare that although I feel envious after hearing others talk about the situation in America, I still don't believe the saying that "the moon is better abroad." But apart from the moon, what I have described above is probably not false, right?

### Peonies of the Old Capital   Yi Yun

In the high-pressure life of Peiping, even when discussing the peonies of recent times, there is a sense of the past and present. In the past, when the flowers bloomed, famous and rare varieties were everywhere. Old trunks and branches were taller than people, and it was unknown how many years of cultivation and irrigation it took to achieve this. Every time I thought of the spring scenery of the old capital, I longed for it. Recently, I received news from a friend and was suddenly shocked that the past prosperity had all become history, and the changes of time were too terrible to describe. Therefore, I especially record it, thinking that old friends who share the same interests, upon knowing this situation, will surely sigh in unison.

(1) Chongxiao Temple: Chongxiao Temple in Xuan Nan has always been known for its peonies. Every time the flowers bloomed, the monks of the temple would set up seats and serve tea, and famous people would gather to admire them and write poems. There was a flower called Tai Chi Diagram, with two colors in one flower, half pale red and half dark red, and the flower was larger than a foot. The trunk was as tall as eight feet, and the shorter ones were as tall as a person. There were also varieties called Black of All Beings and Ink Hollyhock, with black flowers, also as large as plates. There were also several green peony plants, with bean-green flowers, all considered famous varieties. In front of the hall, there was an old Yao Yellow peony, which was the tallest and largest, and the flower was also the same, with a tender yellow color and unparalleled beauty. All the flowers had trunks as tall as people, and they were all fat and large, which was truly rare and precious. Now, dozens of plants inside the gate of the temple have all withered and died, and small trees have been replanted. In the eastern courtyard, which was the most prosperous in the morning, only twenty-six plants remain, some of which are only one foot tall, and the largest are only two or three feet tall, and there is only one plant like that. In particular, the Yao Yellow peony in front of the hall, which was the most famous, has now disappeared without a trace. Only six plants remain in the courtyard, all of which are unremarkable. In the back courtyard, there are only fourteen plants of various sizes. Fortunately, one of each of the green peony, Black of All Beings, and Ink Hollyhock still exists. This spring, the green peony had three flowers, two of which have been destroyed by naughty children. The Black of All Beings had two flowers, and the Ink Hollyhock had four flowers, all as small as cups, and the leaves were thin and withered. In total, there are only forty-six plants in the three courtyards of the temple, some of which are less than a foot tall, some have only a few leaves and no flowers, and some have flowers as small as monthly roses. Many of the temple's side rooms have also collapsed, with coffins piled up, and an eerie atmosphere. There are very few visitors, and the monks no longer serve tea to guests.

(2) Zhongshan Park: In the past, this was the place with the most peonies. Every late spring, there was a sea of flowers and clouds of people. The flower light and people's faces made it a grand occasion. In particular, the patch in front of Laijin Yuxuan was the most outstanding, with old trunks taller than people, and the fragrance was intoxicating. Now, it is much different than before. The entire park has only sixteen patches, and each patch has many empty spaces. Only one patch west of Laijin Yuxuan and one north of Xili Pavilion are barely satisfactory. Among them, several varieties such as Yao Yellow, Jade Edition, Big Leaf Yellow, and White King are still beautiful and worth seeing, and they are as large as plates. The remaining Black of All Beings and green peony plants are far inferior to what they were in the past. However, compared to today's Chongxiao Temple, this is better than that.

(3) Beihai: There are only three patches under the Prajna Fragrant Terrace, most of which are unremarkable.

(4) Taimiao: There are only plants that have been newly planted in recent years. The flowers are still large, but there are no good varieties. However, the manual labor is still abundant.

(5) Longevity Hill: The peonies in Painting-in-Painting, Yulan Hall, Renshou Hall, and other places have all withered and died completely. Only the crabapple trees in front of Leshou Hall are still blooming vigorously.

(6) Other places such as Zhongnanhai are currently closed to visitors, and it is unknown what the situation is. It is said that the flowers in the Forbidden City are also declining similarly. In short, the decline of the flowers reflects the desolation of the place. "What was once appreciated has become a relic!" It is truly regrettable.

Suburban Trip   Bai Jiao

Opening wide to the countryside, closing the door, I speak of worries and diligence. Old reds take advantage of the rain to adorn flowing water, and nimble greens send off the spring, wanting to reach the clouds. Ten thousand years of rivers will never cease, but temporary scenery enters the setting sun. Looking back, many people carrying rice have hungry faces, exhausted, they return to the black fields.

Thinking of Wen Wei in Taiwan over Wine   Yue Dan

In difficult times, I luckily escaped. Carrying pearls on the sea, I am even more saddened by the spring. You can know the taste of wine is a good scholar, dare to expect that I am poor but still pleasing. Many of the gentlemen are lonely now, and a thousand feelings of the past are truly understood. The wind and sun in Taichung are bright and beautiful, I believe you are free to send a scale.

Regarding Churchill's Memoirs   Tong Tuo

British former Prime Minister Churchill is currently writing his memoirs. The first volume contains approximately 225,000 words. Life Magazine in the United States has already printed 50,000 words, and The New York Times has printed 93,000 words. Eighty newspapers outside the United States are also publishing snippets of it. Houghton Mifflin and the Book-of-the-Month Club will publish the full text of the first volume this summer. In early May, Churchill submitted the manuscript of the second volume of his memoirs to Life Weekly and The New York Times. The content describes the worst but also the best period in British history, witnessing the collapse of France and the bombing of London in 1940. The entire memoir consists of five volumes, and the full text of the second volume is expected to be published in January next year.

Churchill's memoir style is full of ups and downs, and extremely fluent. The first volume details the situation of the stable era between the two world wars, using behind-the-scenes anecdotes to show how sharp this historical drama was, and depicts a deep relief. Churchill wrote about Nazi Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to 10 Downing Street on the day Austria was invaded, saying, "That was the last time I saw Ribbentrop before he was hanged." Churchill's writing is as heavy as an ax, which can be seen at a glance.

To begin this arduous writing task, Churchill first collected all the newspapers, letters, and files, and prepared the overall title for each volume, the title for each chapter, and the outline of the five volumes. He said, "First, I laid the tracks, then built the stations, and then divided the routes."

After the chronological order of each chapter was arranged, he typed out an original draft. Then, based on this draft, he dictated it to his secretary, inserting changes in events, anecdotes, and his own opinions at any time. He had several secretaries who worked in shifts.

The draft, organized by the secretary, was reviewed by Churchill, who then revised the sentences, deleted or extended paragraphs to make them balanced. He wrote his corrections in red ink on the draft.

The draft was then sent to the printing press, where it was typeset and printed according to the corrections within 24 hours. However, it cannot be considered the final version. The first volume went through four drafts, and some articles were temporarily inserted, marked with the words "temporarily thought of." When the manuscript of the second volume was sent to the newspaper the previous week, it was also accompanied by a footnote: "The author has the right to freely modify the original text at any time." Churchill used this right to the extreme, sending telegrams to correct or change words at any time, while Life Weekly had to telegraph to seek the old man's consent to change a punctuation mark, or even correct an obvious error.

There was also an episode when the first volume of the memoir was being printed: The newspaper received a telegram from Churchill saying: "The work plan regarding the printing of my memoir is now canceled immediately. The reasons are as follows: ... But I will try to get the newspaper a memoir by Prime Minister Attlee in a short period as a substitute." The editor saw that the date of the letter was April 1st and was relieved. It turned out that April 1st was April Fool's Day, and the telegram was sent by a colleague in the newspaper who liked to joke, impersonating Churchill.

Lamenting Conscience   Pingxi

In this era, prices of everything are rising, and the only thing that is falling, and falling the most severely, is conscience. When talking about people's hearts, one is often refuted: "Conscience, what conscience? How much does it cost per pound!" Originally, conscience seemed to be a very beautiful word, and it was also something that humanity possessed and that human society relied on for stability and evolution. Unexpectedly, once the situation changes, no one cherishes conscience anymore, and everyone tries as much as possible to eliminate it, fearing that they cannot get rid of it completely!

Everyone sees that there are two kinds of people at present: one kind is happy, joyful, and carefree; the other kind is unfortunate, poor, and worried. But why is there this gap? By comparison, it will be discovered that the latter simply has more conscience, and the former simply lacks some conscience. In this way, people's choice between happiness and unhappiness is very simple, and people's choice of conscience is also very clear.

To have a conscience, one must also have hunger and poverty. This philosophy of life makes people know what to do and makes people vigilant. Thus, conscience is like a pair of broken shoes. If you throw it away, you can throw away all bad luck. If you keep it, then a thousand burdens of misfortune will follow. If one can truly get rid of conscience and throw it away without any attachment, it is simply liberation for some people.

What difference does it make if conscience is lost? It makes no difference at all. People live, enjoy, and crowd as usual. No one will feel uncomfortable, perhaps even more convenient. They can flatter, fawn, boast, cheat, slander, and instigate as they please (not conscience), without having to see the suffering of others and feel sad, and without having to shed tears for the misfortunes of others. Isn't it easier to live than before!

The Battle of Waterloo   Ruzi

The Battle of Waterloo decided Napoleon's fate. According to the report by British General Wellington afterward, the fiercest battle took place around a farmhouse. The farmhouse was surrounded by a garden, which was surrounded by a bamboo fence. This farmhouse was very important, so the British decided to defend it at all costs. However, the battle was very fierce, the British ammunition had run out, and the fence outside the garden was on fire. So the British quickly sent a soldier with a letter to ask for help. Before long, two carriages loaded with ammunition came to the rescue. When the first carriage rushed through the burning fence, the gunpowder caught fire, and all the people and horses were blown to death. In the moment after the explosion, the flames temporarily went out. The second carriage took advantage of this moment to rush through the wall of fire and safely bring the ammunition. The British troops waiting for help in the farmhouse cheered, but the fire on the fence burned even more fiercely.

—The British army relied on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to win the battle.

Strange Food   Qian Dacheng

Today, I read an article on Free Talk called "Strange Dishes of Fujian" and was very interested. In my life, I have also eaten three kinds of strange food: dog, turtle, and hedgehog. From the old gourmand's point of view, it may not be considered strange, but in the eyes of the people of Jiangnan, I am considered to have a gluttonous mouth. How are these three things eaten? What do they taste like? Let me tell you.

The dog was given to me by a student, and it was a dog leg. As the saying goes, "Dog meat is fragrant, give it to the teacher," which is true. The dog leg was all lean meat, braised very well; even in the severe winter, the sweat did not freeze, and the aroma was intoxicating. However, after eating it, I was extremely thirsty. Some people say, "Dog meat is hot." Perhaps that is correct.

I have eaten turtles many times. I taught at a Catholic school for six or seven years. Their Catholic friends really liked to eat turtles, because most of the people on the fishing boats believed in Catholicism, so it was easy for them to get them, and of course they shared some with me. Turtles are only suitable for braising, and you need to add a lot of good yellow wine, and you can't add a drop of water. Cook over low heat, and add a little soybean or dried tofu. Before serving, add a lot of white sugar. Cooked properly, it tastes better than soft-shelled turtle. But it is too greasy, and there is too little meat. His carrion is especially difficult to digest. Occasionally eating it, it still feels not bad.

Hedgehog tastes similar to chicken, but it is too troublesome to cook. The thorns on the outside need to be removed with a cotton gin, or its skin needs to be peeled off. It is also suitable for braising, and you should also add a lot of yellow wine.

My personality is curious, and I want to try everything. If people don't allow me to eat it, I want to eat it even more; but after eating it, I feel that it is just so-so, not as good as ordinary fish, meat, chicken, and duck. It is the same with being a person. Splendor is not as good as plainness, and recklessness is not as good as moderation. Therefore, the ancients had the saying "Warm clothes and fragrant vegetable roots." Fish, meat, chicken, and duck are still a bit too extravagant—especially in these years of war and chaos. Strange food is not the proper way to eat, and strange people are not standard people. "Searching for hidden meanings and acting strangely" only shows their utter boredom! Dying from eating pufferfish is still not contrary to human nature's love of eating, but if Tang Haiqiu died from gambling with others to eat rhubarb, then he was curious and fond of fame, so he deserved to die!

### The Closing of the National Games - On the Achievements of the National Games and Farewell to the Athletes

The Seventh National Games, after twelve days of intense competition among thousands of athletes and enthusiastic participation by millions of spectators, completed its various championship events yesterday with a successful closing ceremony. We are fortunate to be in Shanghai, the venue of the National Games. For half a month, we have been enveloped in the intense and enthusiastic atmosphere of the Games, which has particularly invigorated the spirit of our newspaper work. Recalling the opening of the National Games on May 5th, our newspaper celebrated with a special plane and a special train to relay the news with the torch, expressing our utmost admiration. Now, as the Games close and athletes from all over prepare to depart, we wish to extend our sincere regards and farewell. We will share some of our observations, as a parting gift, for discussion with our readers.

The greatest manifestation of the National Games, and perhaps its most important foundation, is undoubtedly the unity and integrity of our Republic of China. One of the most significant achievements of the Games is the strengthening of mutual understanding, unity, and unification among our entire nation. This National Games was held after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, ten years after the previous Games. Its unprecedented grand scale lies not only in the large number of participating units and athletes but also in the "reunion of Northeast athletes after a long separation, and the return of Taiwan athletes to the motherland" (quoting the Chairman's instruction). Remote areas of Mongolia have their own representatives, and overseas Chinese athletes from the Philippines, Southeast Asia, Hawaii, and other places are more enthusiastic and numerous than before. Various costumes and languages are seen and heard at the venue, but under the blue sky, white sun, and national flag, everyone is a citizen of the Republic of China. In the majestic national anthem, everyone merges into one. We all use one kind of writing for signing and have a common national language for communication. This is a truly great manifestation of human society! We have come not so much at the invitation of the Games to compete for championships, but rather summoned by the nation and the ethnic group to contribute to the protection of our nation and ethnic spirit. Within our national boundaries and under our national flag, our bloodlines are connected, and we share a common destiny. Although China is currently facing war and economic recession, it has such vast territory and people, and especially the spirit of valor, progress, harmony, and unity symbolized by the National Games, further proves that it is a great, promising, and limitless nation. Expanding the spirit of sportsmanship and the harmonious atmosphere of the National Games to all aspects of politics and economy as the foundation for national construction – this statement from the head of the Taiwan delegation is the common belief of all athletes. We praise the National Games' contribution to the nation with this, and we wish to use the spirit of the Games to inspire the national self-confidence and unified patriotic spirit of our people.

Secondly, as we bid farewell to the athletes from all over the country, we must praise the excellent achievements of the countless male and female athletes who have won championships in various events. Their talent, physical strength, and years of training have earned them the honor they deserve, bringing glory to their hometowns and laying the foundation for future world championships. At the same time, we extend our best regards to all the athletes who did not win medals or were even eliminated. We also express our respects and farewells to the judges, team leaders, and staff from various places. Su Dongpo once said, "Victory is pleasing, but defeat is also joyful" (referring to chess). This can serve as an epitaph for athletes today, especially as a comforting thought for those who did not win. Why is defeat also joyful? Because it allows one to reflect on the reasons for falling short and to redouble one's determination to improve. Those who are defeated make progress and strive to win, while those who win are also wary and do not become arrogant. Through mutual stimulation and response, there is continuous and endless progress. Moreover, regardless of the number of events participated in or the number of points scored, everyone who participates in the competition can deeply appreciate the magnificent and expansive spirit, understand the profound meaning of personal and team cooperation to win, and be infected by the sporting spirit that cultivates character. Even if one is eliminated, one has gained much. Therefore, we believe that the delegations from various regions, regardless of the amount of energy and money spent, or even the slight detriment to students' studies, can achieve a great return on their investment. As for understanding that the key to winning is persistent and continuous practice – this profound lesson will inevitably lead to the effect of cultivating good exercise habits and physical training. We wish to encourage all athletes with the two words from the National Games: "While victory and reward exist in the moment, the key lies in consistency."

The enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai for this National Games, and the large number of visitors and hospitality in all aspects, can well demonstrate the emphasis placed on the spirit of sports in the country, which is truly a heartening phenomenon for promoting national health. Holding the National Games is merely one method of promoting sports, and promoting sports is only one aspect of the goal of exercise. Therefore, improving health certainly involves various methods of health education and personal exercise. The value of the Games lies not only in sports but also in cultivating a broad sense of personality, the so-called spirit of sportsmanship. This has been widely explained in the Chairman's instructions on the opening day, "so that moral cultivation and intellectual development can be mutually beneficial," and in Minister Zhu's words, "harmony, unity, cooperation, respect for etiquette, and discipline are all aspects of the sporting spirit." Young people who love sports, and even self-loving and self-improving compatriots, should all deeply understand and actively practice this. Of the six arts of Confucianism, archery and charioteering are two. Confucius always taught people to yield, but only in archery did he say, "Gentlemen do not contend, but they must compete in archery?" It can be said that competitive sports have traditionally been respected as a gentleman's competition in our country. The competition of gentlemen must follow etiquette and reason. Therefore, the spirit of sportsmanship is also the demeanor of a gentleman. Victory does not involve cheating or bullying, and defeat does not involve discouragement or envy. Order must be maintained, and discipline must be strict. One should not undermine the overall rules for the sake of local gains or losses. This is the principle of a gentleman's competition, the ethics of sports, and the basic code of conduct for national character. The National Games generally went well, but we cannot help but regret the unqualified attitude of some units towards referees, nor can we tolerate the few incidents that violated discipline. This requires mobilizing national sports figures and public opinion to sanction and eliminate such behavior, so that the next National Games will have better order and an outstanding performance in the World Games. In short, since we recognize that the function of sports extends to intelligence and morality, we must utilize the Games to cultivate the spirit of young people and enhance the moral character of the nation.

After this National Games, the Twelfth World Games will be held in London, and our delegation has departed in stages. During the later stages of this Games, our athletes achieved a great victory in the international track and field competition, which is a good omen for the Chinese athletes and strengthens their journey. Furthermore, the National Sports Federation has resolved to establish the Asian Sports Committee, and some in the public are advocating that China convene the Far Eastern Games in 1951. We certainly hope for a relaxation of international diplomacy, so that the World Games can be held on time and help promote world peace. However, given the lack of preparation conditions in our country in the past, our current urgent task is to strengthen cooperation between the government and society in emphasizing the importance of the Games and various preparations, so that our Chinese representatives can have excellent performances in the World Games, and the Republic of China can gain greater glory in the international arena.

The Seventh National Games has now closed! The athletes who participated in the Games have understood the noble significance of the Games and will bring the enthusiastic spirit and harmonious emotions from the Games back to their hometowns, "so that the feelings of our entire nation can have a more intimate exchange and a more sincere unity," in order to promote the great cause of China's unification, revival, and construction. This was the original intention of convening the National Games and will also be the greatest harvest after the close of the National Games. We wish the Seventh National Games success, and we wish the athletes health and progress!

### Measures for Re-Education of Personnel Who Endangered the Nation and Surrendered Have Been Drafted - With the Main Purpose of Removing Corruption, Inspiring Renewal, Turning Evil into Good

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Ministry of the Interior has recently drafted "Implementation Measures for Re-Education of Personnel Who Endangered the Nation and Surrendered During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion" in accordance with Article 4 of the "Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Nation During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion" and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review. It is learned that the measures stipulate that re-education affairs will be managed by a re-education committee established by the Ministry of the Interior, and re-education centers will be set up in different areas to receive and train these personnel. The locations are as follows: (1) The capital city, covering the areas of Jing (Nanjing), Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. (2) Hankou, covering the areas of Han (Hubei), E (Hubei), Jiangxi, and Henan. (3) Guangzhou, covering the areas of Sui (Guangzhou), Guangdong, and Fujian.

(6) Lanzhou, covering the areas of Xi'an, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Ningxia, and Xinjiang. In addition, in any of the following circumstances, personnel may be sent to the re-education center in the capital city for training if necessary: (1) Those who have served as general-level military officers in the communist army. (2) Those who have served as senior civil servants above the level of Jianren (recommended appointment) in the communist areas. (3) Those who have held positions above the level of the prefectural committee of the Communist Party. (4) Those who have graduated from specialized schools or higher or who have academic status in the communist areas. Secondly, the implementation of re-education will focus on "removing corruption and inspiring renewal" and "turning evil into good," using "education through action" and "education through influence" as means, and supplementing them with various skills and labor services when necessary. After the re-education period is completed, personnel, except those who should have their re-education period extended in accordance with the law, may be recommended for job assignments or provided with funds to return to their hometowns, depending on their qualifications, abilities, and conduct.
