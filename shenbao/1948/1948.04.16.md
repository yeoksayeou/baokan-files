The fifth group of the presidium was on duty, chaired by He Chengjun. After the minutes of the eighth session were read by the secretariat, the presidium reported, with Representative Pan Gongzhan providing an explanation. Mr. Pan explained three points: (1) In response to the request of the majority of representatives to continue the review of political and economic issues, it was decided to hold a session at 3 PM today. However, as there are many requests to speak, representatives are requested to submit their opinions in writing as much as possible. (2) The agenda for today is to discuss the first reading procedure of the constitutional amendment proposals. Six cases have been organized, and other proposals related to the constitution will be referred for review separately.

After Mr. Pan's report, the chairman asked the assembly if there were any objections. With no objections, it was passed.

(2) Explanation of the discussion of constitutional amendment proposals: A. Methods for handling proposals related to the constitution: A. Proposals to amend the constitution that comply with the provisions of Article 174 of the constitution will be submitted directly to the assembly. B.

Reading the Original Text of the Constitutional Amendment Proposals C. The meeting today will discuss six cases that comply with the provisions of Article 174 of the Constitution. Subsequently, representatives inquired about the interpretation of "total number," asking whether the total number was 3,045 or the total number of those elected. The chairman replied that according to the Constitution, the term "total number" refers to the total number stipulated in the Constitution, but the power of interpretation lies with the Judicial Yuan, and the Secretariat of the Assembly may submit a document to the Judicial Yuan requesting an interpretation. The first reading then proceeded, with the reading of six amendment proposals: (1) Zhang Zhiben and 689 others proposed amending Articles 20 and 29 of the Constitution. (2) Mo Dehui and 771 others requested the enactment of temporary clauses during the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion.

### 10th National Assembly Meeting Continues to Review Economic and Political Issues; Representatives' Speeches Focus on Prices and Criticize the Wealthy

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The 10th session of the National Assembly was held at 3:40 PM on the 15th, with 1,745 people in attendance. The sixth group of the presidium was on duty, chaired by Zhu Jiajian. After the minutes of the ninth session were read by the secretariat, the agenda for the day began, continuing the reading and review of economic and political reports. There were a large number of requests to speak over the past two days. The assembly on the afternoon of the 15th was extended until 6:30 PM, but only 19 people had the opportunity to speak. Before the adjournment, the chairman asked the representatives whether those who had not had the opportunity to speak could send their written opinions to the secretariat for compilation and forwarding to relevant departments for written replies, which was agreed upon without objection.

The focus of today's speeches was mostly on rising prices and criticism of wealthy capitalists.

Ms. Xu Pingyu, a female representative from Hubei, loudly called for the liquidation of wealthy capital. She specifically proposed that the list of large merchant clients who made special contributions for relief should be published quickly, that distribution should be fair, and that it should be handled quickly so that by the time the donations are received after prices have risen, they will not be enough to buy two loaves of bread. At the same time, she advocated the liquidation of wealthy capital and bureaucratic capital, because their leadership is the real cause of rising prices. Xu's speech received applause from the entire venue. Several other representatives also spoke on this matter:

Lin Zigui from Fujian stated: The general rise in prices is led by the price increases of state-owned and public enterprises. Therefore, we should quickly order all regions to find ways to bring prices back to the levels before April so that ordinary people can maintain a minimum standard of living.

Su Ting from Suiyuan stated: The current national tax revenue is mostly borne by the poor, resulting in a situation where the poor pay to maintain the country's expenses, which is actually the poor protecting the rich. At the same time, she proposed that the government should subsidize impoverished provinces.

Wang Kongan from Shaanxi stated: Our economy should be built on the foundation of the Three Principles of the People, not on capitalism. However, the current phenomenon is that wealth is concentrated, speculative capital is rampant, and there is no implementation of capital control or equalization of land ownership. At this critical moment for the survival of the nation, he proposed that special relief donations and special donations from wealthy households must be forcibly collected, and he believes that foreign aid is important, but the most important thing is self-reliance.

Gao Xin from Guangdong pointed out: (1) The foreign exchange policy is wrong. Official prices and exchange rates force 200 million US dollars of overseas remittances to flee to Hong Kong every year. (2) The export exchange settlement method is inappropriate. Due to the limitation of the official price, merchants are hesitant to proceed. (3) Import quotas are restricted, causing several factories in Guangzhou to close down. (4) On what basis is the transport of cotton cloth to the south prohibited? The Ministry of Economic Affairs should reply.

Overseas Chinese representative Huang Jingcan believes: Overseas Chinese have contributed greatly to the motherland, and overseas Chinese have purchased a large number of US dollar savings certificates in 1940, but the repayment method has not been resolved to this day, causing overseas Chinese to complain. At the same time, he proposed that the government should improve its policy of protecting overseas Chinese.

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Short-Term Treasury Bill Regulations, Revised Code of Criminal Procedure, and Martial Law

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan held its 352nd regular meeting at 9:30 AM on the 15th, chaired by President Sun Ke. The minutes of the previous meeting were first approved, followed by Secretary-General Lou Tongsun's report on the National Government's directive that subsequent revisions to postal and telecommunications rates must be reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan before they can be implemented. It was held that the special permission to adjust postal and telecommunications rates during the critical period of suppressing rebellion was the same as the authorization to adjust tax revenue. The Legislative Yuan's resolution did not hinder the implementation of this temporary resolution made by the State Council. The discussion items then proceeded: (1) Draft Regulations on Short-Term Treasury Bills of the Republic of China in 1948, passed. (The text is on page 2) (2) Draft Amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, amended and passed. (The text is on page 2) (3) Draft Amendment to Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the Organizational Regulations of the Anti-Smoking Committee of the Ministry of Interior, passed. (4) The loan agreement between the Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of the United States for the purchase of cotton (signed on March 14, 1946, with a credit of 33 million US dollars) and its extension agreement (public letter of September 12 of the same year) were retrospectively approved. (5) The contract for the sale and transfer of ships between the United States and the contract for the sale and purchase of ships built during wartime between the US Maritime Commission and the Government of the Republic of China (both signed on July 15, 1947, to purchase old ships cheaply) were retrospectively approved. (6) The agreement on the issuance of travel documents to refugees under the jurisdiction of the International Refugee Committee was passed, and it was recommended that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instruct all overseas consulates to handle entry visas carefully after the agreement is implemented. (7) Draft amendment to the Martial Law, amended and passed. (The text is on page 2) As for the draft organizational regulations of the supervisory committee of the Control Yuan submitted by the Control Yuan, it was resolved to postpone the discussion because it was not appropriate for the current Control Yuan to formulate its internal organization on behalf of the new Control Yuan. The draft organizational law of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics was resolved to be re-reviewed after the Political Affairs Conference decided on its name, status, and whether to add a "Design Bureau" under its jurisdiction. The draft amendment to the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan related to it was also postponed accordingly. The draft amendment to the Budget Law and the draft amendment to the Air Defense Law were scheduled to be discussed at the next meeting due to lack of time. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.

Representative Pan Gongzhan spoke on behalf of the Shanghai representatives, raising four points: (1) Shanghai is an economic center, and some people accuse Shanghai of being extravagant, luxurious, and full of speculative capital. Where does this speculative capital come from? Does Shanghai print its own banknotes, or does speculative capital from all over the country gather in Shanghai? The responsible authorities should investigate the source of the speculative capital. (2) Shanghai prices were 6 to 7 times higher in 1946 than in 1945, and 20 times higher in 1947 than in 1946. The government implemented a policy of stabilizing prices in 1947, so why did prices rise even higher? The government should provide an explanation. (3) There are many reasons for high prices and high wages in Shanghai. The biggest reason is the repeated increases in the official foreign exchange rate. Every time prices stabilize slightly, the foreign exchange rate must be adjusted once. The reason is that the people who manage foreign exchange are the people who control foreign exchange. Therefore, the central government has consistently refused to implement the import and export linkage system requested by the Shanghai business community. (4) The land disposal measures passed by the Central China Pacification Conference recognize the policy of selecting and retaining communist party members. In the future, people in non-pacified areas will also follow suit. Therefore, we must promote our land policy and not follow the communist party and retain its demarcation methods. Pan's speech was met with applause from the representatives.

Ma Yi, a representative of the Heilongjiang Farmers' Association, expressed dissatisfaction with the takeover of the Northeast and regretted the unclear destination of materials. He believes that the takeover has not won the hearts of the people, but has lost them all.

Zhang Baozi from Shenyang believes that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty caused the current crisis in the Northeast, and the government should quickly propose solutions.

He Defu from Shanxi pointed out that the current famine in Jin Province is severe, the government has no relief measures, and the requisition of military grain is purchased at low prices, placing a heavy burden on the people.

Zhang Tingkan from Yunnan proposed that the method of collecting grain should be changed to a reform tax to reduce abuses.

### National Assembly Representatives on Hunger Strike Jointly Petition Chairman Chiang, Expressing Gratitude, Soliciting Comfort, and Demanding Attendance

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang sent representatives to comfort the eight representatives on hunger strike the other day. Out of gratitude, they recently jointly wrote to the chairman, expressing two points: A. They sincerely thanked the chairman for his comfort. B. Regarding the issue of the signing of representatives attending the assembly, they implore the chairman to find a solution as soon as possible. The letter was delivered to Yu Bin by Ma Wanche and Sheng Zizhuang on the morning of the 15th, and Mr. Yu scheduled to meet with the chairman on the 16th to discuss it. Regarding the issue of the signing of representatives, there was no solution on the 15th. The motion proposed by 1,321 National Assembly representatives was submitted to Chairman Chiang, and on the 15th, the chairman replied to Yu Bin, Wang Chonghui, and one other, stating that he had approved the case and handed it over to relevant election officials to draft measures for review. Yu Bin will request instructions again when he meets with the chairman on the morning of the 16th.

### Humbly Accept, Frank Admission

Executive Yuan Discusses Answering National Assembly Inquiries

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Executive Yuan discussed answering inquiries from National Assembly Representatives at its regular meeting on the 15th. After much deliberation, Premier Zhang Qun gave two instructions: (1) Humbly accept, (2) Frank admission.

### Chairman Zhang Dulun Takes Office in Hubei

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] The new Chairman of Hubei, Zhang Dulun, took office this morning, and the handover procedures between the new and old administrations were completed simultaneously. Additionally, all sectors of Hubei Province bid farewell to former Chairman Wan, presenting him with banners and silver shields.

### National Assembly Representative Kong Xianrong, of Songjiang Antu County, Commits Suicide in Nanjing, Despairing that Volunteer Army Was Disbanded

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Another representative has passed away during the National Assembly. Kong Xianrong, a representative from Antu County, Songjiang Province, committed suicide in his hotel at around 5 PM on the 15th due to anxieties about the national crisis and the destruction of his family. He was found to be already dead. The aftermath is being handled by the National Assembly Secretariat, and the body was transferred to the China Funeral Home that night. Kong was 68 years old and had served as commander of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, commander of the Northeast Security Zone, and commander-in-chief of the Jiyuan Anbian Zone. Kong's command was revoked when the former Northeast troops were reorganized, and his duties were also removed. Kong has a wife, two sons, and two daughters-in-law. When Yongshi retreated, his wife and one son and one daughter-in-law were captured by bandits. Another son and daughter-in-law are stranded in Changchun, and he has a nephew currently detained in the Beijing Model Prison. After arriving in Beijing on the 7th, Kong saw that his niece and daughter-in-law were also in dire straits. At the same time, he felt deeply that the communist bandits in the Northeast were becoming increasingly rampant, and he felt that his heroism was useless, so he decided to commit suicide to awaken the Chinese people and strengthen the advancement of military suppression of bandits.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Wang Xingzhou, a representative from the Northeast, reported on the suicide of Kong Xianrong, a National Assembly representative from Songjiang, during the Presidium meeting on the evening of the 15th. The Presidium expressed regret and sympathy for Kong's suicide and decided to advise the National Government to provide preferential treatment to his family and commend his anti-Japanese achievements. The coffin was closed at 2 PM on the 16th, and National Assembly representatives should go to pay their respects that evening. Kong's body has been transferred to the China Funeral Home. Mo Dehui and Northeast representatives are scheduled to pay their respects at 8 AM on the 16th. Mo told reporters with tears in his eyes that the main reason for Kong's suicide was that his volunteer army was disbanded by the authorities. Although he repeatedly negotiated with the authorities after coming to Beijing, there were no results. Now this tragedy has occurred, and I couldn't help him, I'm really sorry to him. Du Yuming also told reporters on the evening of the 15th that Kong was loyal and brave in defending the country by fighting against the Japanese and suppressing bandits in the Northeast. He expressed extreme sadness that he committed suicide. I had invited him for dinner on the 14th, and when he talked about the disbandment of the volunteer army, he expressed extreme sadness. I didn't expect that he would commit suicide only a day later, which is very regrettable. Kong followed Du to return to the Northeast, and Du had appointed Kong as the commander of the Second Detachment, responsible for guerrilla warfare near Jilin.

### Legal Tender Issuance Amount Confirmed: 69 Trillion Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Confirmed news: The amount of legal tender issued as of the end of March this year was 69,682.1 billion yuan. The tax revenue for this year from January to March was 11,868.4 billion yuan, accounting for 60.23% of the total revenue of 19,704.3 billion yuan and 23.6% of the total expenditure of 50,170.9 billion yuan. The feature of this year's budget for the first half of the year is that ordinary expenditures are balanced by ordinary revenues (i.e., increased tax revenue). So far, the ordinary part has maintained balance, but the special part is inevitably exceeded during the period of suppressing rebellion. However, with US aid having been approved, the situation in the second half of the year can be expected to improve.

### National Army Recaptures Hejian and Dacheng in Hebei; Bandits Wander Southwest of Wuyang in Henan; National Army in Weixian, Shandong, Still Holds on to the City Gates

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The National Army's Civil Salvation Vanguard recaptured Hejian at noon on the 15th. The area was the CCP's military and political center in Hebei, as well as an important supply station. There are many factories and warehouses, and the war results are being investigated. In addition, Dacheng, 75 kilometers from Tianjin, was recovered on the morning of the 14th, following the recovery of Qing County.

[Another dispatch] Military news: After recapturing Dacheng and Hejian, the troops directly attacking central Hebei are expanding their sweep. 4,000 dan of grain seized in Dacheng were used to relieve the poor. On the afternoon of the 14th, more than 1,000 communist bandits were defeated near Dacheng, and more than 150 were captured and given funds to return home on the spot.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 15th] The 7th column of bandits who fled to Xu Shui Cao Hejian on the 14th were largely annihilated after the Baoding National Army launched an attack and severely suppressed them, and the remnants collapsed and retreated eastward in a state of distress.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 15th] The Liu bandits' 3rd and 6th columns wandered in the southwestern area of Wuyang yesterday and today. The Liu bandits' 2nd column and the Chen bandits' 10th column fled west to Niutijie from Shahedian on the 14th.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] The siege and defense battle of Weixian city gates continued all night on the 14th. The defending troops in the north gate fought fiercely, using a dense network of fire to seal off the city gates and annihilate more than 2,000 bandits who invaded the Bayajie street in the city, ensuring the position. The battle on the southwest two gates was also fierce, with the South Barracks being lost and regained several times. On the 15th, except for the east gate, the west, south, and north three gates were all in a fierce battle. The National Air Force assisted with continuous flights to Weixian, creating brilliant results.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyang, 15th] The bandit troops outside Changchun fled north, with one unit of more than 10,000 men, now transferred back to northern Songjiang. The bandits are deliberately creating a false impression, and their Second Column has fled south from Nong'an to Faku, with a tendency to disturb western Liaoning. The threat to Changchun seems to have been lifted, and the focus of future battles may shift to western Liaoning.

### Record of the National Assembly: From Enthusiasm to Indifference

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The National Assembly has convened for seventeen days, and today (the 14th) it begins the constitutional amendment process. As some representatives were not satisfied with the review of political and economic reports, the presiding officers decided on today's agenda, divided into two parts: the morning session (Ninth General Assembly) to discuss the constitutional amendment (first reading), and the afternoon session (Tenth General Assembly) to continue the political and economic review. The agenda was distinctly different, and the representatives' emotions were also distinctly different, showing enthusiasm in the morning and indifference in the afternoon.

Due to the unpleasantness at the close of yesterday's session, the Presidium was concerned about two issues when presenting the constitutional amendment for discussion this morning: one was the fear of dissatisfaction among the representatives, and the other was the fear that the number of representatives present would not meet the constitutional requirement of three-quarters. At the start of the meeting at 9:38 a.m., both issues were resolved smoothly. The number of attendees today was particularly high, second only to the day President Chiang delivered his speech, reaching 2,032, just enough to exceed two-thirds of the statutory 3,045 people. A report by Pan Gongzhan on behalf of the Presidium dissuaded the representatives from opposing the agenda. Chairman He Chengjun, speaking with a Hubei accent, announced the discussion of the constitutional amendment. Hong Lanyou reported on the procedures for handling the constitutional amendment proposals, repeatedly apologizing for the proposals not being delivered to the venue until after the meeting started due to printing issues. None of this caused any problems, but regarding the issue of what fraction of the total number of representatives was required, someone shouted from the balcony: "Please, Chairman, explain whether the total number refers to the legally mandated total number or the total number of those elected?"

Hong Lanyou's explanation did not satisfy the speaker. The Chairman's response was delayed, and someone shouted again: "Why doesn't the Chairman answer more quickly? The Chairman cannot manipulate the meeting!" There was booing from downstairs, indicating that the opinions of this small minority, even just one or two people, were not taken seriously. The Chairman said: According to the Constitution, only the Judicial Yuan has the authority to interpret the Constitution; the issue of the total number will be referred to the Judicial Yuan by the Assembly for interpretation. At this time, the original text of the constitutional proposals was being distributed upstairs and downstairs. There was an uproar upstairs, startling the Chairman. It turned out that some people were fighting over the proposals, causing some minor disturbances.

The first reading of the Constitution was considered to have begun. The six proposals that met the requirements were read out one by one, with the proposers explaining the main points separately. Zhang Zhiben's proposal was presented first, and his amendment received unprecedentedly enthusiastic and prolonged applause from the entire venue. It seemed that his opinion was exactly the opinion of the entire venue. Mo Dehui's proposal to enact temporary provisions also received enthusiastic support from the entire venue. These two proposals were the essence of the constitutional amendment. The four proposals by Liu Weichi, Gao Wei, Pu Ru, and Sun Shengwu focused on partial modifications and naturally met no opposition. The only prominent interlude during the first reading was when Zheng Chuqing, a female representative from the Youth Party, spoke out against the prevailing opinion and opposed amending the Constitution during this period of suppression of the rebellion. However, she suffered the same fate as Liu Huan, with a chorus of boos from the venue, preventing her from continuing. Although she shouted into the microphone to demand the right to speak, her voice was drowned out by the noise. This interlude fully demonstrated the enthusiastic emotions of the representatives. The meeting lasted for two and a half hours in the morning, and no one "drew straws," almost all of them focusing their attention on listening to the content of the proposals and the proposers' explanations.

In the afternoon, the number of attendees was only 1,541, a quarter less than in the morning. Afterwards, they continued to "draw straws." After the break, it was estimated that there were no more than a thousand people. At 6:00 p.m., Chairman Zhu Jiahua announced a half-hour extension, but many representatives left regardless. At the close of the meeting, there were at most six or seven hundred people in the venue. Fortunately, it was a review, not a vote; otherwise, the number would have become a problem again. However, the continuation of the political and economic review was fought for by several representatives banging on the chairman's table, but they did not expect the representatives to have such indifferent emotions, with some not coming at all and others leaving halfway through. The indifference of the afternoon and the enthusiasm of the morning provided an interesting contrast.

One hundred and forty people requested to speak, which was not permitted due to time constraints. This afternoon, the representatives who spoke were very diverse, including those from Northeast, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shanghai, overseas Chinese, and professional organizations. They almost unanimously criticized the impropriety of diplomacy, finance, economics, food, and governance. Their impassioned arguments received applause from the entire venue, but because the number of attendees gradually decreased, both speakers and listeners seemed unable to muster enthusiasm. Therefore, when the Chairman announced, "Representatives who have not spoken are requested to submit their opinions in writing," no one expressed any further opposition. At 6:30 p.m., Zhu Jiahua announced the adjournment of the meeting, and there was a cheer in the venue. This cheer may have been the only expression of intense emotion in the entire afternoon of indifference. (April 15th, Nanjing)

### Editorial: The International Situation and China's Diplomacy

The National Assembly held its eighth general meeting on the morning of the 14th, during which Foreign Minister Wang Shijie delivered a report on foreign affairs. In addition to explaining our country's attitude towards world peace, he also reported on the evolution of Sino-American relations and the four major obligations that the Soviet Union has to China: (1) All Soviet troops, except those in Lushun, must withdraw from Northeast China; (2) The Soviet Union must not provide any assistance to the Chinese Communists who are resisting the National Government; (3) The Soviet Union must not interfere in China's internal affairs in Xinjiang; (4) The Soviet Union must genuinely respect the independence and autonomy of Outer Mongolia. Finally, he also stated our country's policy towards Japan, advocating that future peace with Japan must guarantee that Japan cannot engage in aggression again, but in terms of economics, he does not oppose the self-sufficiency of the Japanese people. From Foreign Minister Wang's brief report, one can also see a general outline of our country's current foreign policy, but it is very obvious that it lacks a spontaneous, progressive, and revolutionary spirit. Its recognition of the international situation after World War II also lacks foresight and prescience. Everyone knows that diplomacy and national defense are the two major weapons for defending a country's survival. In countries where national defense is not very strong, the importance of diplomacy is even more keenly felt. Especially in today's rapidly changing international situation, the use of diplomacy is particularly needed to seek national security and the realization of national policy.

We in the newspaper business are buried in piles of news every day, organizing, researching, and titling, not only understanding our country's domestic situation but also coming into contact with international politics. Therefore, we would like to take the opportunity of the National Assembly's review of China's foreign policy to put forward a few suggestions for the reference of the National Assembly representatives and foreign affairs authorities.

First, we must point out that the international situation after World War II has undergone a complete transformation after two years of evolution. Looking back at modern history, after the end of any international war, a peace conference is bound to be convened to clean up the aftermath of the war. Therefore, the international issue after the war must be how to deal with the defeated countries. The Congress of Vienna in 1814 and the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 are excellent examples. Similarly, after the end of World War II, the so-called international issues, in Europe, were the German issue; in Asia, the Japanese issue. However, for two years, the Allied powers have not been able to agree on a common policy for either the German issue or the Japanese issue. Not only has the peace conference with Germany and the peace conference with Japan not yet been convened, but the opinions of the major powers, especially the United States and the Soviet Union, have diverged and become increasingly distant, making the current international issue the US-Soviet issue. In this situation, it only benefits the defeated countries. Taking Germany as an example, the United States is actively supporting Germany there as an anti-Soviet fortress for the United States in Europe. The Soviet Union also wants to use the anti-American sentiment of the Germans to incite the Germans to launch an anti-American movement. The US-Soviet struggle in Berlin is for this purpose. Looking back at Japan, the defeated has broken into a smile because the American government and the public are filled with calls to support Japan's recovery. The only one to be pitied is China, which won but did not benefit. Japan's recovery is a threat to China's security, which Foreign Minister Wang said that our country's policy towards Japan is that militarily, Japan must not be allowed to engage in aggression again, but economically, it does not oppose the self-sufficiency of the Japanese people. On the surface, this policy towards Japan is fair and reasonable, but in reality, there are still problems. In modern international warfare, military and economic affairs are inseparable. Japan's economic recovery is the restoration of Japan's aggressive forces, which no one can deny. This is one point. Arming Japan as an anti-Soviet outpost for the United States in the Far East is not only advocated by some in American public opinion, but Japan is also using this to ingratiate itself with the United States. If our country advocates strict military control to ensure that the peace treaty can guarantee that Japan will not engage in aggression again, how can it be implemented? Simply following the United States will inevitably lead to historical mistakes. The Japanese misunderstand that our country's public opinion on Japan is close to that of the United States, which is a major flaw in our country's policy towards Japan.

Second, we advocate that diplomatic policies should not be immutable but should be used flexibly to adapt to the international environment. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country fought alongside the United States while maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union and accepting Soviet aid. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country accepted US aid while signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which is sufficient to show that our country not only wishes to coexist peacefully with the US and the Soviet Union and cooperate closely to ensure peace in the Far East and the Pacific, but also acts as a bridge for peaceful cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union, promoting understanding between the US and the Soviet Union and jointly creating world peace. Taking this diplomatic policy in the international environment at the time can be said to be appropriate. Because the urgent demands of our country and people after the war are nothing more than construction and recovery, which naturally require international peace and also require US economic assistance and technical cooperation. Also, because China and the Soviet Union share a border of thousands of kilometers, the friendship of the Soviet Union is naturally also needed by our country. Therefore, we do not hesitate to pay any price to sign a treaty of friendship and alliance with it. However, for two years, the continuation and expansion of internal strife have affected our country's international status, preventing our diplomatic policies from achieving the expected results. On the one hand, we urgently need US economic assistance, creating a mistaken impression on the US that our country relies solely on foreign aid and does not know how to rely on its own efforts. Therefore, the US and its public opinion often criticize our country, which limits US economic aid to China. On the other hand, although our country does not hesitate to pay any price to pursue the friendship of the Soviet Union, the result is that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has become a treaty of friendship that our country unilaterally fulfills. The major obligations borne by the Soviet Union have not been realized. Foreign Minister Wang's impassioned appeal at the National Assembly the day before yesterday, demanding that the Soviet Union earnestly fulfill its obligations, shows that our country has paid a heavy price but has not been able to exchange it for the friendship of the Soviet Union. From this, we really cannot help but admit that the inferiority complex of the foreign affairs authorities has led to the failure of our country's diplomacy.

Third, we believe that the bipolarization of the world is becoming increasingly clear. In the US-Soviet contradiction, being pro-American or pro-Soviet is not the way out for our country, but rather easily invites unexpected disasters. According to the old saying, we only have one unbreakable principle, which is independence and self-reliance in foreign affairs. Only by taking both approaches can we maintain the balance of power in the Far East. If we can constantly strengthen ourselves and become the only stabilizing force in the Far East, we can obtain the friendship of the Soviet Union even without paying any price. If we can be self-reliant and able to bear the responsibility for peace in the Far East, the United States will be afraid that China will not accept its assistance, so where will any problems arise!

### Hangzhou "Stove Dispute" Murder Case: Deng Zhiou's Wife's Suicide Note Alleges Grievances

[Hangzhou, Fourteenth, This Newspaper] No. 60 Jingjiang Road, Hangzhou, is the residence of Deng Zhiou, a secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Cai Yiming, a commissioner of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau. Last month, due to a stove dispute, relations between Deng and Cai deteriorated. Mrs. Deng committed suicide out of anger. After the incident, Deng Zhiou sued Cai Yiming as the mastermind behind the tragedy and organized a "Support Association for the Tragedy of Mrs. Deng." According to the association's telegram, Mrs. Deng left a death note to her husband before committing suicide, which read: "Zhiou, I was forced to commit suicide by the Cai family over the stove dispute. He bribed the police, who dragged me and humiliated me. The court prosecutor ordered me to pay 2 million yuan in compensation. When I responded reasonably, I was again subjected to willful abuse and imprisoned in a wooden cage. I was allowed to go home in the evening, but the injustice and humiliation were unbearable. I will meet my children in the next life. Your despondent wife." According to the victim's family, "Mr. Cai temporarily moved downstairs in July last year. This was originally leased by Sun Benjie, a former provincial committee member. After Sun left, the owner of the Wuzhou Drugstore entrusted Cai to take care of it. Recently, the owner plans to move his family to Hangzhou for his own use and has repeatedly urged Cai to move with the owner's letter. Unexpectedly, he angered Cai. The stove does not belong to Cai, and Cai has neither a lease relationship nor has he ever paid for it. It is obviously an attempt to occupy it. Now, he has even gone so far as to dispute the stove, forcing a person to death. He immediately fled in fear of punishment. Later, police were sent to guard him, and the borrowed furniture was moved away early the next morning." Various circles in Hangzhou are closely watching the amicable settlement of the case.

### Regulations on Short-Term Treasury Bills

### European Economic Cooperation Draft Treaty Completed - Sixteen-Nation Conference Opens Today - US Negotiating Bilateral Agreements with Various Countries

[United Press Paris 15th] Representatives of the sixteen Western European countries participating in the Marshall Plan yesterday formally completed the draft regulations for a permanent European economic cooperation organization. The organization is modeled after the United Nations, and the draft is scheduled to be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference for approval today. At the same time, the Foreign Ministers' representatives will also draft the agenda for the plenary session of the Foreign Ministers on the 16th.

[Associated Press Paris 15th] The European Sixteen-Nation Economic Cooperation Committee yesterday afternoon passed a multilateral treaty listing the contributions of European non-communist countries under the European Recovery Program. The chairman of the committee, British representative Franks, has turned over some provisions of the treaty to the working group for terminological changes. The main point of contention is Article 6: "The contracting states cooperate in the concept of achieving a multilateral trade system that is substantial and balanced, such as complying with the principles of the Havana International Trade Charter." This clause was inserted after the United States pressured to include it in the European aid program treaty. The committee's final meeting this afternoon will approve the entire treaty and hand it over to the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the countries participating in the Marshall Plan for signature. The Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held at the French Foreign Ministry on the morning of the 16th.

[Reuters Washington 14th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett announced that the United States has begun negotiations with the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan on bilateral agreements between the United States and those countries.

[Reuters Athens 15th] Officials recently announced that Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza will discuss issues to promote understanding between the two countries when they attend the European Sixteen-Nation Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Paris tomorrow. Italian Ambassador to Greece Prus has held exploratory talks with Tsaldaris in Athens this week, and the issue of compensation is also one of the topics. Before departing for Paris this morning, Tsaldaris said that the talks with the Italian ambassador focused on financial issues within the scope of the peace treaty, and that the resolution of financial issues is a prerequisite for promoting understanding between the two countries.

### Implementation of the Western European Alliance - Foreign Ministers of Five Nations to Discuss in Paris

[Reuters Paris 14th] Rumors that the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will take advantage of their participation in the Sixteen-Nation Conference in Paris to discuss the establishment of a Consultative Committee under the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Convention have not been officially confirmed. A British spokesman did not deny the possibility of the five countries exchanging views, but the time and place of the discussion have not yet been decided. It is said that France favors setting up the Consultative Committee in Paris, while the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg favor setting it up in Brussels. However, since the Western European Alliance also involves defense issues, some also advocate setting up the Consultative Committee in London. France believes that since the economic powers of the Consultative Committee are closely related to the permanent institutions of the European Recovery Program's Sixteen Nations, it is best to set it up in Paris.

### Truman Asks Congress to Allocate European Aid Funds

[Agence France-Presse Washington 14th] President Truman today submitted a formal bill to the House of Representatives, requesting an appropriation of $4.245 billion for the European Recovery Program.

This figure is listed in the final draft of German aid that Germany submitted to the British-American military government officials today.

### Truman's Remarks - Confident of Re-election as President

### New Czech Constitution - Land to the Tiller

[Agence France-Presse Prague 14th] The new Czech Constitution was published today, and its economic system has the following three characteristics: (1) Natural resources, large enterprises, and financial institutions in industry are all nationalized; (2) Land property is distributed according to the principle of "land to the tiller"; (3) The development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the inviolability of personal private property are protected.

[Associated Press Prague 15th] The Czech Central Action Committee today read for the first time the draft of the proposed new constitution, calling itself a people's democratic republic and listing itself as a member of the Slavic family of nations. The constitution will be distributed throughout the country for people to comment and make suggestions before it is finally passed by the parliament. The constitution stipulates that the parliament adopts a unicameral system with 300 members who serve a six-year term, and the president is elected by the parliament for a seven-year term. Men and women have equal rights.

### US Aircraft Squadron Flies to Germany - Demonstration Over Italy Denied

[Reuters Washington 14th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett stated at a press conference today that the American Superfortresses currently flying to the American zone of Germany are purely for practice flights. He solemnly denied the reports that these aircraft would fly to Italy on Sunday, the day of the Italian general election, for a demonstration.

### "Factory Guards" on Standby; Austrian Communists Brew Coup; Soviets Tighten Siege of Vienna

[Reuters Vienna, 15th] Western Allied sources here deeply fear that the Soviet Union's restrictions on the movement of Western military personnel are preparing for the Austrian Communist Party to launch a coup. They point out that the Soviet Union has tightened its encirclement of Vienna to obstruct the movement of Western Allied military personnel. Soviet authorities have notified a certain Western Allied nation that when dispatching troops to Vienna, they must first notify the Soviet Military Headquarters. Furthermore, it is reported that Soviet Army Commander-in-Chief Kolasov will request a resolution at the Allied Commission on the 16th to restrict the ability of occupying forces' military personnel to be called upon to assist the Austrian police in emergency situations.

General concern is focused on the so-called "Factory Guards," organized by Communist workers in the Soviet zone. With a strength of approximately two thousand, they are a fully armed and highly mobile force, capable of serving as a strong tool for the Communist Party to launch a coup. The recent restrictions on Allied military personnel's movement issued by the Soviet authorities are largely aimed at British personnel, as the British zone is closer to Vienna. The Soviet authorities' main traffic restriction measures are targeted at highway traffic. In the event of an emergency, the highway is the only shortcut for Western Allied forces to advance to Vienna. Western Allied nations are unlikely to agree to the Soviet Union's request to cease Allied assistance to the Austrian police. This request superficially appears to protect Austria from Allied interference, but in reality, it facilitates the "Factory Guards," the Communist armed force, to enter Vienna without the ability of the Allied nations to help.

### Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany to Implement Currency Reform

[Reuters Berlin, 15th] It is reported that the Soviet military administration in Germany has received orders from Moscow to proceed with detailed plans for currency reform in East Germany. The Soviet military administration has instructed the German economic and financial authorities in the Soviet zone to carry out this task. Sources close to the Soviet military administration and the German administrative authorities say that currency reform in East Germany could be implemented by the end of May or early June.

### Rumor of a Hundred Soviet Tanks Gathered in the Southern Suburbs of Berlin

[United Press Berlin, 15th] British officials reported on the 14th: Approximately one hundred Soviet tanks entered the southern suburbs of Berlin on the evening of the 14th. It is claimed that the forest area where the tanks entered is approximately three miles from the American zone of Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 15th] It is said that Soviet authorities have taken note of the British report that Soviet troops and tank convoys have concentrated near Berlin, even within the city of Berlin. Soviet sources say that this news is purely provocative and will be responded to.

### British House of Commons Passes Abolition of the Death Penalty; Five-Year Trial Period

[United Press London, 14th] The British House of Commons on the 14th abandoned party lines and, despite government opposition, passed by a vote of 245 to 222, abolishing the death penalty for murderers for a five-year trial period. If the bill becomes law, within the British Empire, only those convicted of treason, piracy with violence, and destruction of royal shipyards will be punishable by death. During this five-year trial period, British murderers may be sentenced to life imprisonment instead of being hanged. When the bill was unexpectedly passed, there was jubilation in the House of Commons. Members were extremely excited, cheering, shaking hands, and throwing paper. Such ecstasy was rare in the solemn House of Commons.

### Italian General Election Outlook; Ruling Party Confident of Victory

[Associated Press Rome, 14th] Right-wing newspapers here today report that the Italian Communist Party has been greatly alarmed by the Soviet Union's rejection of the three-nation (US, UK, France) proposal to hold a meeting to discuss the return of Trieste to Italy. At the same time, American diplomatic observers believe that the Soviet Union's move shows that it has abandoned hope that the Italian Communist Party will win the national general election on the 18th. Prime Minister Gasperi, after returning from a speech in the north today, issued a statement expressing that the Christian Democratic Party is quite confident about the general election. However, the Communist Party's actions are as intense as ever. Six thousand people in Milan marched and demonstrated today under the leadership of workers, posting slogans and criticizing the Prime Minister. Gasperi and Communist leader Togliatti are scheduled to deliver their final campaign speeches in Naples tomorrow night, after which the people of the country will have twenty-four hours to consider whether to support or oppose the Communist Party in the vote on the 18th.

[Reuters Rome, 14th] Although the Eastern and Western powers are simultaneously exerting pressure on Italy, recent analysis shows that serious disturbances are unlikely to occur during the vote on the 18th, and large-scale riots, revolutions, or coups are not expected to occur after the election results are announced. According to Professor Feigis, director of the most important public opinion testing organization in Italy, the Taussa Institute, approximately 29 million Italian voters will participate in the election, but at most only 85 percent will vote, with the remaining 15 percent abstaining due to illness, distance, ignorance, or lack of interest. However, he expects that some parties will not hesitate to use improper methods to generate more votes, so the total number of votes cast may reach 90 percent of the total number of voters. The professor continued that he expects the Christian Democratic Party to win at least 40 percent of the votes, while the Communist Party group, if lucky, will not win more than 30 percent of the votes. Fei believes that leftists in northern Italy today are not as pro-Communist as they were in 1946. Communist forces north of the Apennine Mountains, except for Milan, as well as Bologna, Modena, and Parma, have suffered considerable losses, but in Rome and southern Italy, although the Communist Party is in the minority, its power is stronger than before.

### Ballot Marked with Red Treated as Spoiled Ballot

[Agence France-Presse Rome, 15th] Reports from Florence warn women voting in the election not to wear lipstick, as ballots slightly marked with red will be treated as spoiled ballots.

### US Occupation Zone in South Korea Plans to Generate Electricity Independently; Resisting Soviet Power Outage Threat

[United Press Washington, 14th] US officials said on the 14th that the Soviet military administration had threatened the US by cutting off the electricity supply in the US occupation zone in South Korea. This pressure tactic is similar to those used on US transportation lines in Berlin and Vienna. In order to resist this threat and strive for self-reliance, the US has dispatched several electricity supply ships. These supply ships can handle emergency power supply matters in the South Korean occupation zone.

### US Occupation Zone in Germany Orders Expulsion of Hungarian Representatives

[Reuters Frankfurt, 15th] The US military government chief, Clay, recently ordered four members of the Hungarian expatriate community and eleven members of the Hungarian property restitution mission in the US military zone of Germany to leave the US military zone within forty-eight hours. Clay, in a memorandum to Hungary on this matter, pointed out that the Hungarian authorities refused US officials to enter Hungarian territory with a US expatriate train on January 21, 1946, and that the Hungarian authorities failed to prevent Soviet soldiers in Hungary from robbing and engaging in other undisciplined behavior against the train. Clay also said that unless Hungary can provide a satisfactory reply, the US authorities will continue to take other actions.

### Soviet Female Reporter Peterzhi Writes to Freedom of the Press Conference; Protesting Soviet News Policy

[Central News Agency Geneva, 14th, United Press] It is reported that the Secretariat of the Geneva International Freedom of the Press Conference has received a letter from Peterzhi, a former Soviet female reporter in Shanghai. In her letter, she protested against the Soviet Union's news policy around the world. However, the Secretariat does not intend to take action on this matter. It is said that the conference can only handle issues raised by official delegations and inquiring institutions. Peterzhi recently resigned from her position at the Soviet Daily News. She has also criticized the Soviet TASS News Agency and the Shanghai branch of the Soviet Journalists Association for their policies (she has been expelled from the association).

### All Vietnamese Parties Oppose Bao Dai as a French Puppet; Franco-Vietnamese Peace Talks Near Collapse

[Associated Press Hong Kong, 15th] Sources close to the French side claimed today that the Vietnamese peace talks between France and Annamese King Bao Dai are nearing collapse. The reason is that the French attitude remains stubborn, and the Viet Minh insists on complete independence in political, economic, and military affairs. Party leaders do not want Bao Dai to be restored as a mere French puppet.

### Collector in Tsuruga, Japan Discovers Ancient Chinese Coin

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 15th] A collector in Tsuruga Castle on the coast of Japan, Honshu, has discovered an ancient Chinese "Huoguo" coin from over 1,900 years ago. According to the Tokyo Minpo, Japanese archaeologists believe that this is currently the fifth such coin in the world. The coin was cast by Wang Mang and is extremely valuable. Professor Umehara of Kyoto Imperial University recently discovered one at a collector's home in Osaka, which is generally believed to be the fourth such coin. The Japanese people pay much attention to this. Takahashi, a collector at Tsuruga Castle, discovered after reading Umehara's report in a magazine that there was also a Huoguo coin among his family's collections spanning several generations.

### UN Special Session Opens Today; Palestine Armistice Conditions Drafted; UN Police Force to Be Stationed in the Holy Land

[United Nations Office in Shanghai] According to Lake Success Telegraph: The United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session to discuss the Palestine issue, scheduled to open at 11:00 AM on the 16th at Flushing Meadows.

[Reuters Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations Palestine Committee has decided to immediately begin organizing a United Nations police force in Jerusalem, which will be centered around British police officers who originally served in Palestine. Their service contracts will be valid from May 15th to July 1st, and their salaries will be paid by the United Nations organization. At the same time, the conditions for a Palestine armistice, after informal consultations between the Security Council countries, have been finalized and made public today.

[Associated Press New York, 14th] The five-nation meeting of the Security Council announced tonight that the conditions for a Palestine armistice have been drafted, with the following general contents: (1) All military actions, riots, acts of terror, and destructive acts such as strikes and market closures will cease; (2) All armed forces or individuals capable of using weapons are prohibited from entering Palestine; (3) All weapons and military supplies are prohibited from being transported into Palestine; (4) All political activities will cease pending the UN General Assembly's special session this Friday to re-discuss the partition plan.

### US Bituminous Coal Miners' Strike; Aftermath Still Unresolved; Lewis Contempt Case to Be Sentenced

[United Press Washington, 14th] National Miners' Union President Lewis was tried in federal court today, refusing to plead to the charge of contempt of court for one of the court's three-day orders, namely, notifying national bituminous coal miners to cease their strike. According to this charge, he may be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment. Sentencing is scheduled for tomorrow. At the same time, although the strike was resolved on the 12th due to an agreement on pension issues, approximately half of the 400,000 miners have not yet returned to work, awaiting the court's sentencing of Lewis.

### US-Soviet Army Strength Comparison; Bradley Supports Universal Military Training

[United Press Washington, 14th] Chief of Staff Bradley said today to the House Military Affairs Committee that if the United States does not implement universal military training, it must expand its regular army. The Soviet Union currently has 170 active divisions. Intelligence we have received makes clear that it can increase to over 300 divisions within 60 days. The Soviet Union's satellite states can mobilize 95 more divisions. The United States currently has approximately nine divisions. None of the divisions are fully staffed. At the end of World War II, the United States had 90 army divisions, 89 of which were stationed abroad. If we do not implement universal military training, the best security measure is to expand the regular army so that it can sustain a war for one year, pending the effect of mobilization. In other words, the United States needs a basic army of 125 divisions, approximately 1.5 million men.

### Under Heavy Machine Gun Nests; Inter-American Conference Resumes Yesterday; Bogota Still Chaotic; Conflicts Near Marshall's Residence

[Reuters Bogota, 15th] The 21-nation Pan-American Conference, which was suspended due to the rebellion in Colombia since the end of last week, resumed today at the Presidential Palace in Bogota. The palace is surrounded by barbed wire and heavily guarded by armed guards and machine gun nests. The issue of European countries' colonies in the Western Hemisphere, which was on the agenda, remains unresolved. Most representatives expect the conference to close in at most ten days after the resumption.

[Reuters Bogota, 14th] Five days after the outbreak of unrest in Colombia, rioters continue to appear in the city, putting Bogota in a state of nervous tension. Conflicts are still taking place in the nearby Chapinero district and not far from Secretary of State Marshall's residence. Furthermore, the Pan-American Conference, originally scheduled to resume on the 14th, has not been able to do so. It is reported that Secretary of State Marshall is working to enable the conference to resume within 24 hours.

[Reuters Bogota, 14th] Colombian Foreign Minister Angel recently denied the claim that Colombia has severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. He said that the Colombian government has not yet taken definite action on this matter, and the radio station's report on Sunday that it had broken off relations with the Soviet Union was premature.

### Passengers of the Wanli Steamer Detained in Communist Area; Possessions Looted, People Safe; Families Flying to Tianjin and Qingdao Today to Visit and Prepare to Contact the Communists for Rescue

[Our Newspaper Tianjin, 15th] The Changcheng steamer, which sailed from Shanghai to Tianjin, sent a telegram after inspecting the situation of the Wanli steamer, stating: "The Wanli is sunk at the foot of the mainland mountain, with the deck fully exposed. It is obviously a shallow reef. If it were not in the Communist area, it would be very easy to salvage. No passengers drowned. The location is near the Communist area, and many passengers are blaming [the ship]. It is impossible to approach." According to a telegram from business circles: Yang Hexin, one of the passengers of the Wanli, wired Shanghai, saying: "Now out of danger, safely arrived in Yantai." It is heard that all personnel are safe, but their possessions have been looted by the Communists. The personnel may be sent out of the Communist area within days.

[Central News Agency Tianjin, 15th] As of the afternoon of the 15th, the true whereabouts of the 452 passengers on the Wanli steamer aground north of Shengshan are still unknown.

[Our Newspaper] The Wanli steamer of the Fumin Shipping Company ran aground at Bei Shengshan and sank, with passengers and crew landing and mistakenly entering the Communist area. Various details have been repeatedly reported in the news. According to the company's news yesterday, in response to the requests of the passengers' families, the company chartered a special plane from China National Aviation Corporation this morning, carrying nine representatives of the passengers' families, and five staff members from the company, to accompany them to Qingdao to inquire about the whereabouts of the passengers. Another group of personnel also took a flight to Tianjin this morning to contact Qingdao. Furthermore, according to a telegram from the company's Changcheng steamer, it went to the accident site of the Wanli steamer the night before. The night was dark, making it impossible to inspect. Upon the company's order, they waited until dawn and saw the Wanli steamer aground at the foot of the mainland mountain. Presumably, the bottom of the ship was punctured by a reef. The captain, fearing that the ship would sink, immediately accelerated towards the foot of the mountain, causing it to run aground in a shallow beach, thus avoiding sinking. Therefore, although the ship's hull has cracked open, the ship's waterline is above the water surface. It has been decided that all crew and passengers have disembarked. On the other hand, among the more than 400 passengers on the Wanli steamer sailing from Tianjin to Shanghai, there were 13 foreign passengers, including 9 Russian expatriates. It is heard that a certain Russian organization in this city received a telegram from these Russians reporting that Chinese and foreign passengers and crew were all very safe, but their exact whereabouts are unknown.

[Another Message] The families of the passengers of the Fumin Shipping Company's Wanli steamer have hired lawyers and organized the United Association of Wanli Steamer Passengers' Families. As of yesterday, more than 250 people had registered to join. Today, nine representatives from the association, including Zhou Xiaomin, Dong Henghua, and Lin Yanling, along with company personnel, took a special plane to Qingdao this morning to find ways to rescue them. The planned rescue method is to first have the special plane go to Qingdao to find out the whereabouts of the passengers and request the US and Chinese navies to send personnel to rescue them at the accident site. If there is still no information, all will fly to Tianjin and, together with the Tianjin passengers' families, board the Fumin Company's rescue steamer "Changcheng" and sail directly to Yantai to set up an office and then contact the Communist-controlled area to carry out rescue work.

Company Statement

Based on various reports, the person in charge of the Fumin Shipping Company issued a statement on the grounding of the Wanli steamer: "The Wanli steamer carries 452 passengers, including 336 men and 116 women, including 13 foreigners, and 93 crew members, and 488 tons of cargo. It ran aground near Shengshan on the 12th and sank at the foot of the mainland mountain, with the left side of the hull and the deck fully exposed. There are no signs of people on the ship. It is assumed that they have landed, but the area is controlled by the Communists, so it is difficult to send a ship directly for rescue at this time. However, the lives of the passengers are safe. They may be transferred to Yantai to escape danger. Furthermore, there is a temple on the mountain at the grounding site, as well as a village providing food and lodging, 21 miles from the accident site, and Yingyang County. The lives of the passengers can be safe."

### Ping Jade King Sends Telegram Arriving Safely in Yantai

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 15th] Tie Bao-ting, the Ping Jade King, carrying six boxes of jade for sale in Shanghai on the 12th aboard the Wanli steamer, encountered danger but has wired that he has safely arrived in Yantai. The priceless jade king has been lost entirely.

### Ministry of Finance Replies to the Senate on Proposals Regarding Profit Tax

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Senate previously stated that the current profit tax law calculates profits based on currency value, resulting in false profits and real taxes, which is unreasonable. It has drafted four methods: (1) To adapt to the currency value, industrial and commercial capital should be allowed to be adjusted in proportion to the average price index between the original registration year and the tax year. (2) To calculate profits fairly, changes in kind should be used as the standard for profit and loss. Only if the surplus of kind increases can the surplus be settled according to the latest price. (3) Appropriately increase the special treatment of tax officials. (4) Improve the industrial and commercial accounting system, issuing a unified bookkeeping standard, suggesting that the central government refer to and correct them. According to the Ministry of Finance's reply: "It has been found that the Income Tax Law has been revised and promulgated by the government order of April 1 this year. Among them, for the enterprise income tax item, the assessed capital amount has been abolished, and the net income amount is used as the tax base, and the asset valuation method has been leniently stipulated, and various unavoidable donations and expenses are also allowed to be generously listed, in order to reduce the burden. The improvement of commercial bookkeeping has also been circulated to various bureaus for trial implementation, which is in line with the purpose of the proposed amendment."

### Chamber of Commerce Again Sends Telegram Requesting Reduction of the Estimated Number of Income Tax Payments

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the Ministry of Finance's adoption of a six-fold prepayment method for this year's enterprise income tax is too much to bear for businesses, especially at a time when the people are poor and wealth is exhausted. In addition to Xu Jiguang, Du Yuesheng, and Luo Qinghua continuing to appeal on behalf of industry and commerce in Beijing, a special telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, earnestly stating that since the special excess profit tax law has been abolished, the estimated number of income tax payments should be based on the previous year's income tax paid, so that businesses and people can catch up with paying taxes and overcome difficulties together.

The Bureau has agreed to send the Guoshan steamer to rush to tow it this morning (16th). It is heard that the Yonghuang tanker ran aground on a beach, so the hull was not damaged. Once it is towed out of danger, it can continue to sail to Hankou.

### Fuel Oil Prices Adjusted Again Yesterday

### Sale of Fishing Administration Fishing Vessels: Deciding to Select Ten for Initial Repair

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fishing Administration Office of the Custody Committee of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has sixty fishing vessels. It was previously decided that they would be sold to private fishermen, but because the application procedures had not been finalized and the repair work would take time, they have not yet been sold. It has now been learned that at its second meeting the other day, the Vessel Clearing Committee of the Custody Committee decided on three key points regarding the sale of fishing vessels: (1) After inspections by the shipyard and several external architects, it was decided to first select ten vessels with relatively minor damage from the sixty vessels prepared for sale and repair them. It is estimated that the repairs can be completed in about six weeks, and they will then be sold. (2) Although the contract for the distribution of fishing vessels has been agreed upon by representatives of the Executive Yuan and the United Relief Services and approved by the Custody Committee, the application procedures have not yet been finalized. The procedures were originally drafted by the Fishing Administration Office, but the Custody Committee did not fully agree after receiving them. Therefore, it was decided to send all relevant materials to the legal advisor of the Custody Committee for review and drafting. However, these procedures will also be announced in the near future. (3) Mr. Kirkpatrick, an American member of the Custody Committee, previously proposed that some of these sixty fishing vessels be offered for lease, but no specific plans were proposed. Therefore, the Vessel Clearing Committee will ask the original proposer to submit a fishing vessel leasing plan. Before the leasing proposal is approved, the original plan to sell the vessels will continue to be followed.

### Family Tragedy of a Puppet Army Brigade Commander: Li Baiying Accuses His Wife from Prison of Abusing His Young Son to Death

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Baiying, the puppet army's third brigade commander under the command of Ren Yuandao, served as the commander of the Advance Army of the Lower Yangtze River Suwan Border Region after the victory. He was later sentenced to two years and six months in prison by the Jiangsu High Court on suspicion of being a traitor and is currently detained in the Jiangsu Military Prison outside the Changmen Gate in Suzhou. Recently, Li filed a complaint with the local District Prosecutor's Office, accusing his wife, Xu Hanqing, of embezzlement, adultery, abusing their young son to death, and destroying evidence. Li is now fifty years old, and his wife, Xu Hanqing, is thirty-three years old, already a significant age gap. After Li was arrested, according to the complaint, Xu not only did not try to rescue him but also destroyed Li's favorable evidence, leading to Li's imprisonment. On one hand, she had an affair with Tian Hanhua, an accountant at Yunzhong Girls' High School on Fuxu Road, abandoning the family and hiring lawyers Zhu Yongkang and Zhou Chunfang to file a divorce lawsuit in the local court. At that time, Li was imprisoned in Suzhou. The local court granted the divorce on January 17 of this year. On the other hand, she unauthorizedly sublet the building at No. 7 Rongkang Lane, 240 Moore Road, rented by Li to a person surnamed Xie, pocketed the money, and fled. Xu had a son, nicknamed Li Xiaodidi, who was only three years old. Xu, finding it inconvenient to live with Tian, abandoned Li Xiaodidi at the home of the old maid, Chen Ma, who abused him to death. Li then filed a complaint with the local District Prosecutor's Office. Currently, the District Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation. The plaintiff, Li Baiying, was escorted from the Suzhou Military Prison by guards to Shanghai to testify in court. After the interrogation, he was returned to Suzhou, and the defendant, Xu Hanxiang, was ordered to post bail.

### House Tax to Be Collected Based on Rent: Two Supplementary Measures Defined; Distribution of Rent Survey Forms Begins

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's house tax collection method was previously resolved by the Municipal Council to be changed from the summer of this year to be calculated based on the actual rent paid by each household, at the same old tax rate. No resolution was made regarding self-occupied properties. The municipal government felt that implementation was extremely difficult. If the current value were estimated as the basis for calculation according to the house tax regulations, it would not only be of little help but would also inevitably lead to many disputes, and manpower and financial resources would be insufficient. Therefore, at the 119th municipal meeting, supplementary measures were passed: (A) For all (1) self-occupied houses, (2) houses that are rented without rent, (3) houses where part of the house is built by the resident, (4) false declarations, (5) failure to declare within the prescribed deadline, and (6) other similar situations, the house tax will still be calculated according to the original re-estimated full-year rental value of the 26th year of the Republic multiplied by a certain multiple, and the tax will be levied at the prescribed rate. (B) The maximum rent limit passed by the Municipal Council at its fifth general meeting was 9,000 times for commercial use and 7,000 times for residential use. It is now stipulated that in all cases mentioned above, the lower rate will be applied uniformly, based on the re-estimated full-year rental value of the 26th year of the Republic multiplied by 7,000 times, and the tax will be calculated at the prescribed rate. It is reported that the municipal government has sent this case to the Municipal Council for review and has instructed the Finance Bureau to comply.

[Additional Report] The Municipal Finance Bureau has recently printed a "Rent Survey Notice to Residents," notifying all residents to declare their actual rent payments within a limited time to begin collection.

### Jiangyun Ship Passenger Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea; Suicide Note Signed Xia Zhong

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Jiangyun ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company departed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 13th. In transit, a first-class E-room passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea. According to the third steward, Zhao Pinxing, the passenger boarded the ship at around 3:00 PM on the 13th, wearing a gray tweed suit, with no luggage, only carrying two packages of food. After dinner, at around 8:00 PM, the passenger wanted to go out for a walk, but it was the time for collecting tickets, and all the doors were closed, so he could not go out and returned to his room. He left the room again at around 9:00 PM. It was not until 3:00 AM the next morning (the 14th) that it was discovered that he had not returned to his room. An inspection of the table revealed a suicide note, which read: "To whom it may concern, I am using your ship to seek my final resting place. My surname is Xia, my name is Zhong, also known as Wenjun, a 24-year-old from Shanghai, a retired soldier," and so on. Left behind was a full-body photo in military uniform, 858,000 yuan in cash, and leftover snacks, sweet oranges, melon seeds, and candies.

### Destruction of Graves and Unauthorized Construction of Houses: Appealing to the Law

[Report from Our Newspaper] There is a vacant lot behind the old local court on Huining Road in the Nanshi area, owned by Shen Wenzhao and Xu Qingzhang. Xu's ancestral graves are also on the land. During Qingming Festival the other day, Xu went to sweep the tombs and saw that the land was being heavily developed with the construction of buildings.

After inquiring with the Baojia, it was learned that the occupant of the house was named Zhu Baorong. Negotiations with Zhu yielded no results, so they filed a lawsuit with the court, accusing Zhu of occupying the land and excavating other people's graves, requesting the court to order the house to be returned to its foundation and to return the excavated coffin and corpse to their original place.

### Monk Arrested for Receiving Stolen Goods

[Report from Our Newspaper] When Zhu Jiangshi's family from Workshop 155 of Zhongfang 7 Factory at 155 Changshou Road in West Shanghai hired monks to perform rituals on the 14th, they discovered that the monk's hat was from the Ganlu Temple in Jiuyuncun, Caoyang Road, Zhabei. Someone secretly reported it to the Putuo Road Police Sub-Bureau. Zhu Shechang ordered patrol officer Xu Senfu and police officer Wang Xiaoqing to rush to the scene and take the monk to the bureau for interrogation. According to the monk, his name is Juecheng, the abbot of the Putuo Temple in Fa Hua Town. Last April, a monk named Liaoyi gave him a pawn ticket to redeem several monk's robes, two "Five Buddha Crowns," and other items such as table curtains, red robes, and ancestral robes. Liaoyi then sold them to monks Ru Ru and Guantong from the Hongqiao Shimin Village and the Jiangsu Road Dasheng Temple respectively. After further investigation by the original case officer, stolen goods were found in the above two places, and the two monks, Ru Ru and Guantong, were arrested and brought to the bureau. They confessed that last April, a major theft occurred at Ganlu Temple, and a few unscrupulous monks, including Liaoyi, colluded to steal and sell the items. They admitted to being greedy and buying them at low prices. They will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The fugitive thief, Monk Liaoyi, is still being sought for arrest.

### Sudden Increase in Dismissal Cases: Social Bureau to Convene Factories to Encourage Protection of Good Workers

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to statistics from the Social Bureau, in the past half month, cases of factories dismissing workers and labor disputes have suddenly increased. Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Bureau, told reporters yesterday that this phenomenon occurred after the security authorities of the city arrested a large number of underground communist elements hiding in the labor community last month. Some factory owners took the opportunity to dismiss workers they had long been at odds with. As a result of this incident, the general workers are inevitably panicked, and those responsible for trade union work are even more silent and dare not argue. The owners feel that this is a great opportunity and take advantage of it. However, the government only arrests those who participate in communist work and have conclusive evidence. The government remains committed to protecting the occupational safety of good, honest workers. Therefore, the Social Bureau will soon convene factory owners in the city to come to the bureau for talks and persuade them not to allow similar situations to occur again.

### Lisheng Factory Closes and Dismisses Workers: Social Bureau Considers It Inappropriate; Mediation to Be Conducted Again Within Days

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Lisheng Iron Factory in the city recently applied to the Social Bureau to close the factory and dismiss all workers due to constant strikes and slowdowns by the workers. This case is currently being handled by the Mediation Section of the Social Bureau. Fan Kechang, the head of the Mediation Section, believes that the workers' demands are unreasonable, and the owner's use of closing the factory to deal with it is also inappropriate. Therefore, he ordered the factory to continue maintaining production. The factory has agreed to resume work, but proposed an exchange condition, insisting on laying off 23 workers. Fan Kechang will convene both parties again within days to conduct mediation.

### China Textile Staff Privately Grants Interest Discounts for Corruption: Accountant Suspected and Detained for Interrogation

[Report from Our Newspaper] A corruption case occurred at the China Textile Corporation, which was investigated in court by the District Prosecutor's Office the other day. The China Textile Corporation's daily operating income in March reached approximately 3 billion to 4 billion, and it was stipulated that the funds should be deposited into the Bank of Communications daily. At the beginning of this month, an auditor from China Textile went to the Bank of Communications to audit the accounts and found that the remittance dates did not match the deposit dates. The person in charge of handling this was Fei Yuwen, a staff member of the cashier's office. Fei fled upon hearing the news. Subsequently, Shu Yunzhang, the general manager of China Textile, discovered that the accountant, Huang Zheng, was suspected of colluding with Fei in corruption and arrested Huang. Huang was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on the 10th of this month. The other day, Prosecutor Yu Bixin questioned him in court. According to Huang's confession, the corruption was committed by Fei alone. He only transferred 3 billion from Fei on March 13 due to a cash flow problem in his business, and he knew nothing about other situations. As a result, he was detained. According to the investigation, Fei's method of corruption was to delay the daily operating income from being deposited into the Bank of Communications by three or four days, or even up to half a month, and privately grant interest outside. Because the daily amount was as high as 3 to 4 billion, the interest figure was quite alarming. It is planned to send the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. As for the fleeing suspect, Monk Liaoyi, we are waiting for him to be arrested and brought to justice.

### Yan Peixing Is Rumored to Be Feigning Insanity: The Reason Is Property Disputes; A Notable Answer to the "Insanity Mystery" Case

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yan Peixing "Insanity Mystery" case has developed to the point where, although the court is still waiting for the summons of doctors Han Fen and Huang Yingbang on the 27th of this month to debate whether Yan Peixing has a mental illness, the general public already has a very definite understanding of whether Yan is insane or not. The key point that people find incomprehensible is: if Yan Peixing is not insane, why did he write those bizarre notes? If he is indeed insane, why did his wife intentionally preserve those bizarre notes and photos? Although the couple has their own explanations for this mystery, they are clearly very far-fetched. Recently, a notable answer has been widely circulated: Yan Peixing initially cooperated with his wife to feign insanity, but the act turned into reality, almost causing him to lose his life.

To verify this claim, reporters specifically interviewed Yan Yuan and relatives close to them. Although they all denied the matter, their relatives, standing as third parties, believed that Yan Peixing did feign insanity, which evolved into a scene of "the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind," and behind the oriole is the tragedy of the insane.

According to what they said, there are two reasons for Yan Peixing feigning insanity. The first is to acquire the shares of other shareholders in his textile hardware factory, including the shares of his two nephews. The second is that during the enemy-occupied period, the factory's products were sold to peers and then resold to the enemy. Yan was afraid of being accused of being an economic traitor, so he feigned insanity to avoid it.

Origin of Huaxing Hardware Factory

Yan's Huaxing Textile Hardware Factory was not called Huaxing when it was founded in the 26th year of the Republic. At that time, the general distribution office on Henan Road was the "Xinyue Textile Supplies Manufacturing Factory," and the branch factory on Da Xi Road was the "Shenda Yarn Tube Factory." In addition to Yan's brother, Yan Peide, there were other shareholders in the former. The total capital at the time of establishment was 18,000 yuan, and the latter's capital was 15,000 yuan, one-third of which was owned by Yan Peide. In the 29th year of the Republic, Yan Peide went to Yixing Dingshan Zutan to sweep the ancestral tombs and was killed by the Japanese army in Taihu Lake on the way back. Then Yan Peixing took over the factory's affairs alone. By the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, the factory's business was extremely developed and had a considerable position in the textile hardware industry in Shanghai. At this time, Yan Peixing, on the one hand, wanted to avoid possible troubles after the victory, and on the other hand, was tempted by the considerable amount of property in the factory. After discussing with his wife, he feigned insanity and lived in Wuxi, deliberately writing bizarre notes and taking bizarre photos. Yan Yuan Baoying told people that Yan Peixing was insane, and the factory was in a mess and losing money. He told his two nephews and other shareholders: You should split the shares and operate them yourselves. As a result, the two factories actually split up. According to his two nephews, the property they received was less than half of their due shares. From then on, the New Pharmaceutical Factory and the Shenda Factory merged into the Huaxing Textile Hardware Factory, and his two nephews opened a smaller Renfeng Steel Wire Brown Factory in Zhoujiaqiao.

This general process is said to be Yan Peixing and his wife working together to deal with Yan's nephews Yan Xinwu and Yan Xintai. Yuan Baoying said that Yan's nephews wanted to seize their uncle's property, while Yan Xinwu and Yan Xintai said that their shares were swallowed up.

No Children for Ten Years, Unhappy Marriage

Now that the factory's shares have been unified, Yan Peixing's misfortune began within the family. Yan and Yuan had been married for more than ten years without having a son, which is the root cause of their disharmony. During the enemy-occupied period, Yan Peixing married two concubines, both of whom were found by Yuan Baoying, but soon they were intolerable to Yuan and were driven out. The first marriage was to the sister of Yuan's sister-in-law, which was broken up under the pretext of having body odor. Then he married a woman from the same village named Gui Xiu, who was said to have syphilis. It is said that the three of them went to the Third Medical People's Hospital on Tiantong Road and the Shude Hospital in the French Concession to test, but in the end, the poor Gui Xiu was driven out of Yan's house. Thus, they never had a son, and Yuan Baoying pinned her hopes on her nephew Yuan Xiangzheng. Yuan Xiangzheng's hometown was originally said to have only six acres of land, but now he has actually opened a "Tailai" textile hardware factory himself. Yuan Baoying wanted to marry her fifteen-year-old daughter to Xiangzheng as a live-in son-in-law, but Yan Peixing firmly opposed it, because first, the two were eight years apart in age, and second, they were too close in kinship. This conflict of opinions widened the rift between the couple, and Yan Peixing's mental illness had become well-known. In this way, Yan Peixing's entry into the Puchi Sanatorium finally happened.

Visiting Relatives at the Hospital, Confessing the Past with Tears

After Yan Peixing entered the hospital, his two nephews and other relatives went to visit him once. They had originally been skeptical of Yan Peixing's mental illness. In the hospital, Yan Peixing said with tears that he was sorry for them in the past and that he really did not have a mental illness, and asked them to find a way to save him. Later, his sister informed the Garrison Headquarters, and he was released.

Yan Peixing now deeply resents his wife and always says not to talk about the past. If he is really a "smart person" playing a comedy, the result is a character in a tragedy. It is conceivable that he has indescribable pain in his heart.

All in all, this is a family tragedy involving serious social issues. From the perspective of a citizen: First, were there armed men who escorted Yan Peixing when he entered the Puchi Sanatorium? Second, if Yan Peixing is indeed not insane, what responsibility should the hospital authorities bear for detaining him? Third, has Yan Peixing's property been encroached upon by behind-the-scenes figures? These important doubts need to be thoroughly investigated by the authorities to clarify the darkness in this society!

### Small Episode: Taking Steel Wire, Accused of Theft

[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 5:00 PM yesterday, someone went to Yan Peixing's factory on Tianbao Road to take a large amount of steel wire. Subsequently, the accounting room reported to Yuan Baoying and reported the theft to the Tilanqiao Police Sub-Bureau. After investigation by the police station, it turned out that Yan had agreed to the move, so it was not accepted.

### Low-Interest Export Loans

Guangzhou Implemented Since Yesterday

[Our Dispatch from Guangzhou, 14th] Low-interest export loans in Guangzhou were implemented today (14th). All exporters with actual proof can apply for loans. The terms are divided into two types: three months and one month. However, although exporters are interested in low interest rates, they must settle foreign exchange according to the official price, so the application is unlikely to be enthusiastic.

### Amounts on Drafts and Vouchers: Unit Allowed in Yuan

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Clearing House received a telegram from the Bankers Association yesterday, relayed from the Ministry of Finance on April 9, instructing each clearing house to exchange drafts and vouchers, and the amount should be in yuan as the smallest unit, rounding off below one yuan.

### Bank Customers Should Use Real Names

Remittances Must Also Be Handled Similarly

Regarding the use of real names by bank customers, since the National Government announced the "Regulations on Restrictions on the Use of Names," the Ministry of Finance issued a general notice to all banks and financial institutions that all customer names should comply with the regulations and that it is no longer permitted to open accounts and deposit funds using shop names. Later, to avoid perfunctory violations, the Ministry of Finance formulated and promulgated the "Measures for the Ministry of Finance to Supervise Banks and Financial Institutions to Promote the Use of Real Names for Depositors." The main points are to stipulate that customers who have previously opened accounts under non-real names must change to real names within three months. Those who exceed the time limit will be transferred to a special account for withdrawal, without interest. In the future, depositors should use real names when opening accounts and should fill in their occupation and address, without any omissions. It is now known that regarding the names and addresses of domestic remitters, measures have also been formulated. All banks and financial institutions that handle domestic remittances, whether telegraphic transfers, mail transfers, or bank drafts, should have the remitters fill in the remitter's and payee's real names (or the full names of the institution, company, or manufacturer) and detailed addresses on the remittance application form, and the remitting bank should register the remittance account at any time, without any omissions.

### Market Hesitation and Fear: Yarn Market Still Weak Yesterday; Dye Factories Unload Cotton Cloth Downstream

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was sluggish, and sales on this street were also sluggish. Therefore, all levels opened at lower prices, and the fluctuations in the process also tended to be narrow. Although 42-count Blue Phoenix loudly called out 235.5 million in the middle, and 21-count Double Horse opened at 141 million, due to market hesitation and lack of upward momentum, plus speculators actively taking advantage of the opportunity, market prices continued to decline. The former finally closed at 232 million, falling another 1 million, and the latter once saw a low price of 137 million. By the time of the closing, speculators slightly hedged, and there was a slight rebound, ending at 139 million, continuing to fall by 4 million. Each grade of 40-count and 32-count fell between 1 million and 6 million, and each grade below 20-count continued to fall between 1 million and 3 million.

At the morning opening, all cloths were exhausted. Private dye factories, due to the continuous decline in grey cloth prices and the sufficient supply of spun-built companies, sold futures first, but customer demand was still lacking. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 4.74 million and gradually fell to 4.71 million, with few buyers. Each grade of fine cloth fell by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. 120s drill fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, and the rest tended to hover in a sluggish range.

He told reporters: "It was previously stipulated that Shanghai merchants going to Wuxi and other producing areas to purchase grain had to be issued a purchase permit by Shanghai and an exit permit by the Wuxi County Government. The procedures were too complicated, and merchants complained that it was inconvenient." He suggested to the Jiangsu Provincial Government authorities that this procedure be waived. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Grain and the Wuxi County Government agreed. However, in the future, each organization and group purchasing in Wuxi will still need to have a purchase permit.

### Rice Prices Rebound

The rice market rebounded slightly. Because prices had been falling for days, the market had been sluggish for a long time. Yesterday, because the price of tin rose and rice shops on this street replenished their stocks, and because very little goods had arrived in recent days, sellers' willingness to sell also decreased.

Yesterday, a total of 3,482 piculs of goods arrived at the North and South markets.

Flour: Slightly better, but transactions were calm. The market trend was minimal. Because there were still few customers, and limited replenishment on this street, but because of the rebound in rice prices, sellers also had the intention of holding up prices. Lao Che and Bingship each rose slightly by 5,000 yuan, and Jiancheng and Hongfeng rose by 10,000 yuan. Lilihongxiang flour was delivered at a price of 2.14 million yuan for 70 pounds.

Red sorghum was slightly firm, sesame rose again by 300,000, and raw peanuts also added more than 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Only soybeans were sluggish, but the market was set, and the market also turned firm.

Edible Oil: Rebounded, due to the exhaustion, oil factories rarely opened, and the amount of goods arriving also decreased. Yesterday, because rice prices rebounded, people's spirits were lifted, and this street successively supplemented stocks at low prices, and sales became active. Factory soybean oil returned the money for the first time to do 8.05 million, and instantly, under the strong buying atmosphere, it rose straight to 8.2 million. Swatow merchants came to purchase soybean cakes, rising by 20,000 yuan.

### Trade Representative to Japan, Zeng Jiyin, Discusses the Future of Trade with Japan

[Our Dispatch] The Chinese private trade representative to Japan was unable to start business due to the lack of visa accounting methods, and specially recommended representative Zeng Jiyin to return to China to request. Zeng has returned to China for more than ten days and has gone to Beijing several times to negotiate. It is now known that the visa accounting method for trade with Japan has been approved by the Executive Yuan and is being notified to all relevant agencies for reference. Zeng told reporters yesterday: "After the official documents of this method arrive at the Chinese delegation in Tokyo, the delegation can use this as a principle to negotiate with the Allied Economic Bureau and then agree on actual trade methods. Due to the shortage of foreign exchange in China and the lack of strong credit, it is necessary to export first to obtain foreign exchange and then use it to purchase Japanese goods for import. At present, the goods that China can export to Japan are tung oil, pig bristles, animal skins, and raw lacquer, etc., but the number that merchants can control may not be large. Due to the lack of foreign exchange in both China and Japan today, the short-term commercial outlook is not good. At the same time, Japan has some products that others welcome but China does not need. For example, last Christmas, an American businessman bought 100,000 children's toys and shipped them to the United States, where they sold well, but China has no such demand. The inconsistency of supply and demand is also one of the difficulties in Sino-Japanese trade." Regarding the general economic situation in Japan, Zeng said: "The speed of recovery of Japan's light industry is amazing; and its industrial and commercial circles are tightly organized, act consistently, and save food and clothing at home and export quality products with all their strength. This year, imports and exports will not only be balanced, but will also form a trade surplus. Japan is currently suffering from a lack of raw materials, and China can supply a part; but even if China does not supply, other countries will supply. For example, animal skins were originally imported by us before the war, but recently, 3 million tons have been ordered from Canada and more than 5 million tons have been ordered from Australia. Whether Sino-Japanese trade is beneficial to our national economy depends entirely on our own operation."

### Dagong Defeated Hualian: Won the Mayor's Cup Championship

Green Team Defeated Shanghai English in the Women's Final

[Our Dispatch] The championship finals of the men's and women's groups of the Third Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament were held last night. The Municipal Gymnasium was crowded with 10,000 people, with 5,000 to 6,000 fans, an unprecedented situation, and there was no record in this season's basketball tournament.

The Green team defeated Shanghai English in the women's group, 46 to 35. In the first half, the Green team led 24 to 16.

### The Golden Age of Chinese Periodicals

— Sun He

—Memories from the Late Qing Dynasty to 1924

As a professional journalist, the author seems to have a blood relationship with the history of Chinese "periodicals," and has been paying attention to, and fond of them, from student days to the present. I feel that Chinese "periodicals" from the late Qing Dynasty to before 1924 had an indelible spirit of the times, which is worth recording and learning from. I would like to dedicate this article to readers and people who love periodicals.

What we first feel is not only not blameworthy, but also indelible, is Liang Qichao's "Xinmin Congbao" and "Qingyi Bao" edited in the late Qing Dynasty. Although his political and social reforms were limited to constitutional reform and did not advocate overthrowing the Manchu Qing government, and although he advocated a "virtual constitutional monarchy," he did introduce a large number of new ideas and systems from the world, giving China a powerful enlightenment in politics and society. He cleared up Zhang Zhidong's erroneous theory of "Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application," and we should not hesitate to give him a high evaluation. In particular, Liang's own skilled and unrestrained writing style opened the door to Chinese vocabulary, and his articles were so erudite and extensive, although the depth and density are not enough today; but at that time it was indeed the beginning of a bold trend; making people still think of that magnificent, magnanimous spirit today.

Later, another periodical "Min Bao," published in Yokohama, was a step further in Chinese political thought than Xinmin Congbao. It cleared up the latter's illusion about the Manchu Qing Dynasty and put forward the slogan of national revolution, challenging the constitutional reformists with a brand-new revolutionary posture. The editor was Zhang Ji, who recently passed away. Although he himself was not good at writing, there was no shortage of talented and broad-minded revolutionary party members who could compete with Liang Qichao in writing; because of the righteousness and strength, people felt a kind of vitality, a kind of domineering spirit. Recalling it now gives people a feeling of being from another world.

"Jiayin Magazine," published in 1914, was a powerful weapon for Zhang Shizhao to attack Yuan Shikai's Hongxian Dynasty, and completed the historical mission of revolution at that time. Zhang Shizhao's articles at that time were not only logically rigorous, but also full of vitality, vigorous and well-organized, not like Liang Qichao's unrestrainedness, nor like some people such as Dai Tianqiu and Wu Zhihui's "running wild," and truly integrated ancient prose, logic, and political commentary. Not to mention Mr. Zhang Binglin's simple, every word with a source and sharp articles, enough to kill the enemy. (Later, Jiayin was re-published in 1924 and became a publication praising Duan Qirui's government and slandering the founding father, which was of course a self-destruction of history, not only not worth watching, but also disgusting.)

Before this, "Eastern Magazine," and after this, "Pacific" and "Youth China" also had their historical value. The former two had some rigorous academic papers. Even today, they may not be completely ineffective, although world academia has made great progress in the past thirty or forty years. The latter's awakening of national self-esteem and its unwillingness to succumb to the rise of the great powers was truly a youthful spirit. Although today some of the writers at that time have transformed into politicians and forgotten their ancestors, they are happily abandoning their long-changed claims.

"New Youth," which became the new bible and biography of youth around the May Fourth Movement in 1919, not only fulfilled the enlightenment mission of Chinese new culture, but also laid the foundation for new thought. So many warriors from the old society rebelled and struck at the vital points of the old society. Thirty years have passed in a hurry, some have died, some have changed, and some have "married," giving people a feeling of white clouds and gray dogs. However, a periodical has such great power and influence. I am afraid that not only was it unprecedented in China's past, but it will be difficult to have again in the future.

"Yu Si," published in 1924, more or less inherited the tradition of New Youth. This small periodical was originally a publication casually launched by professors at Peking University, but it turned out to have a very important place in Chinese cultural history, which was due to its active attitude, unyielding battle against the Kuomintang youth who massacred the revolution and the pro-foreign Anfu clique government. Even the old man Zhitang, who later advocated diluting, was also attacking feudal forces and imperialists as a fighter at that time. And what is particularly worth mentioning is that the short commentary essays that have now grown into a powerful and universal genre were published at that time with "Idle Talk Collection" and "Our Idle Talk" as columns, collecting articles from many authors.

This article is limited in length and can only briefly discuss comprehensive periodicals. Pure literary periodicals representing the spirit of the times are not involved here. Let's stop here.

### On News from the Keyhole

— Lin Ye

News from the keyhole has a variety of different names, to name a few of the more common ones: such as "inside news," "behind-the-scenes news," or "news behind the news," etc. Ultimately, there is only one meaning: anything hidden behind the covered part.

The value of this kind of news, as seen today, is "sweeping thousands of troops" and "unparalleled in the world." At the very least, it has become one of the targets of competition among journalists. Obviously, publications that win a large number of readers in the market have succeeded in this area. For example, "Xinwen Tiandi," which has been published in Chongqing and has maintained its existence to this day, has 40,000 readers; and the readers of Nanjing's "China News," which recently imitated it, are also gradually increasing; even "Guancha Zhoukan," which is known for its political commentary, does not dare to ignore this kind of news. The same is true from the perspective of Europe and the United States: in 1932, Drew Pearson, a Washington correspondent for the "Baltimore Sun," and Robert S. Allen, a Washington correspondent for the "Christian Science Monitor," jointly published a book called "Washington Merry-Go-Round," which made informal behind-the-scenes commentaries on the current political situation, and thus caused a sensation in the entire United States, resulting in a leap to become famous columnists.

Why is the value of this kind of news so high? Tracing its roots, there are roughly the following kinds:

First, news from the keyhole is the most difficult to obtain. If you can't find the way, can't find the keyhole, or don't have a key, you simply can't open the door. Sometimes, even if you find a fragment, it is accidental, or it is due to your own deduction, citation, and judgment. This kind of news that is not easy to come by is of course more precious than ordinary news.

Second, everyone always has something that cannot be made public, and things are the same. There are many places that need to be kept secret, but the more things that cannot be made public, the more strictly kept secrets, the more interested everyone is in them, so being able to satisfy this interest can gain a large number of readers. In other words, to gain a large number of readers, you have to compete with others in this area, and news from the keyhole becomes precious and important.

However, the following situation often occurs: many "secrets" that do not need to be concealed become valuable news once they are concealed. In other words, some news that originally had no value leaps to become the object of hunting by reporters after going through the "concealment" stage. This phenomenon is produced because of overestimating this kind of news.

Third, the facts that are concealed are often very important. They may cause a sensation in the entire society and the entire human race. The relationship between governance and chaos is very great, and therefore it is important.

The last and most important one: it is the most full of the meaning of Interest. The so-called Interest is the ability to provide new facts, creating new situations and new problems. Old news (facts) that are accustomed to seeing and hearing cannot arouse Interest; it carries rare, extraordinary, unknown, and unpredictable facts.

News from the keyhole is the most important news is undeniable, but the reporting cannot escape the constraints of the concept of news ethics, and everywhere must keep in mind a sentence: "I work for everyone's needs," and cannot violate conscience to fabricate facts, and even more cannot write some news that leads people to evil with inferior techniques.

Block publications and yellow newspapers, that is, the so-called "Shanghai style" news, are the most prevalent in Shanghai. Grasping the psychology of readers, they specialize in finding rumors in the streets and alleys, or fabricating some facts, such as publishing the secret history of big figures, releasing some news that can stir up and bewitch readers; with no factual basis, they are satisfied with just good sales and large profits. This is the tragedy of the news world and the obstacle of the newspaper industry.

### Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

A suspicious person doesn't even trust his own shadow.

A person without faith is like a lamp without light.

Money can buy a good name, but money often destroys a good heart.

The most difficult to control stubborn enemy in the world - yourself.

If there were really four springs in a year, then what would be worth praising about spring?

If you believe that life is really a difficult and arduous journey, you will no longer have so much disappointment, injustice, and crying.

Children grow up quickly, why can't adults grow old all at once? You, be careful and cherish your golden youth.

Snails are not suitable for nomadic life because they can't leave their homes.

### Difficulty in Hiring

— Dan Sun

A housewife in Norfolk, Virginia, USA, has been very happy recently because the most troublesome "hiring" problem has been solved. She has hired a maid to come twice a week to help her with cleaning work.

One morning at half past nine, the maid came. At this time, the housewife was cooking breakfast. She thought the maid must like to have breakfast before working, so she made a particularly hearty breakfast, with fried eggs, bacon, and baked delicious biscuits.

"After you have breakfast," the housewife said, "wash these pots clean before scrubbing the kitchen."

"Madam," the maid announced, "I don't do any scrubbing work."

The housewife was a little surprised, but after thinking about it, it's better not to argue. So she suggested: "Okay, wash the pots first, and then go clean the bathroom."

"Madam, I've already told you, I don't do any cleaning work." The maid replied immediately.

"Do you mean," the housewife said, "come here, sit down and have a hearty breakfast; don't do any work, and then I'll give you wages, right?"

"Well, madam," the maid replied, "that was really a delicious breakfast. I guess it would cost seventy-five cents to eat in a restaurant."

So the maid took out seventy-five cents from her purse, put it on the table, added a dime of ocean, and strode away.

### Reminiscences of Lao Can's Calligraphy

— Dacheng

Two years ago in mid-spring, I traveled to Suzhou with a friend and went to the Baicheng Bookstore on Hulong Street. A book friend showed me Sun Yirang's Gu Zhou Shi Yi, saying that it had annotations, but he didn't know who wrote them. I took it and saw that the calligraphy on the cover was thin and firm. On closer inspection, the annotations had one or twenty items, all prefixed with the three characters "Biaoyun Case," which was indeed Liu Tieyun's (Lao Can) true handwriting. Biaoyun was proficient in the study of bronze and stone inscriptions, and in modern times, those who study oracle bone inscriptions also regard Tieyun as the ancestor. His novel "The Travels of Lao Can" is even more well-known and read by everyone. He had a very rich collection of books in his life, and there were quite a few fine Song and Yuan editions. He also mentioned them in the novel. The book friend's judgment was not accurate, so I got it at a low price, and I was ecstatic for many days.

### Five Quatrains

— Su Qianying

Written on Receiving Mr. Xie Bin Hong's Painting of Wuyi Nine Bends

Ink and brush imitate Jing Guan, strange rocks and peaks hard to climb, my humble room now adds to the scenic beauty, I often feel like I am in Wuyi Mountain.

Inscribing Mr. Xian Zhao's Painting of Oak Trees at Han Temple

Every time I see the red cotton, I feel unbearable, half my life swaying in the river, when will I be able to set foot on Xiangqiao Stone again, leaning on the towering temple to face the blue mountains.

Inscribed on Bamboo and Rock Presented to Mr. Wu Jianlan

Not flaunting colors like ordinary flowers, a kind of purity and strangeness, who can pity, only the bamboo under Yunlin's steps, knows how to sweep away the clouds in the sky again.

Reply to Liu Zuochou in Singapore

Your superb skills are rare in the world, my leisure is unparalleled, in the autumn window, during the night of fine rain, when we linked poems, respectfully reading the rushing torrents amongst the pines. Silk thread fills the old dreams of Lian Tao, in the quiet west window, the shadow is lonely and sparse, but because the love of longing has not ended, I am not as good as you when trying to accompany to the new poetry.

### Idle Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14: Leisure on the Sea - 117

The letter read: "To Elder Yu Ru, I, Qi Wan, having received your teachings, am determined to thoroughly fulfill my promise. I have used various methods to sever all thoughts of Zhu Zhai. Not wanting to be dragged down to a point where my reputation is ruined, and realizing the environment does not permit me to, I believe many people must be gossiping, laughing at, and scolding me behind my back since I left Beiping. I have no way to defend myself. Only you, Elder, understand the intricacies of the matter and perhaps feel indignant on my behalf. I no longer have the face to return to Beiping and see my colleagues! However, I am not discouraged by this. I treat the past as if it died yesterday, and I will make a new start. I have followed my mother's advice and returned to the stage, partly forced by the need for livelihood and partly to dispel the boredom of my days. I will entrust my spirit to art, hoping to forget the wounds of the past. Fortunately, I have received much help from various quarters in Shanghai. Mr. Mei has officially accepted me as his disciple and guides and supports me. I recently performed in Shanghai and received a very warm welcome from the audience. I know these are but fleeting fame and dare not be complacent. Furthermore, these fleeting fame cannot relieve the pain in my soul. You, Elder, are a man of old virtues. You can understand that the fragile seedlings of a young girl's heart cannot withstand repeated destruction. Every day I drift along with the tide, performing on stage, and every night, when all is quiet, I am overwhelmed with emotions, my pillow wet with tears. I dare not tell others of this suffering, and only before you, Elder, can I pour out a word or two, hoping that you will have pity. How is Zhu Zhai doing lately? I have given him many bad impressions, which should be enough to stimulate him. I hope he hates me, hates me to death, only then will I find comfort in my heart.

If he knew all my actions, knew that I intentionally provoked him, the truth would cause him even greater pain. How to permanently hide this from him depends entirely on your judgment, Elder. I frankly tell you, Elder, that I will never forget my feelings for him in this lifetime. I only hope that he can forget me completely, reducing my sins. I also hope that he will strive for progress to comfort you in your old age, and I will be spared the reputation of a heartless woman. I will never correspond with Zhu Zhai. Although I miss him to the extreme, I will not write a single word to him to cause him distress. Now, to dispel the boredom in my heart, I indulge in a romantic life all day long. Outsiders do not know and think I am living happily and successfully, but who knows that I have a knot in my heart that cannot be erased, and the deeper the days go, the more painful it becomes? I should not have told you these things, Elder, but apart from you, I cannot tell anyone my suffering. Please forgive me, Elder, and I wish you good fortune! Qi Wan respectfully." After reading this letter, Zhu Zhai stood foolishly under the peach tree, staring at the peach blossoms, without saying a word. Xiao Bai patted him on the shoulder and said, "Zhu Zhai, you should also work hard so as not to let her suffer in vain. What she said in the letter is entirely meant to urge you to improve. You must understand her intention." Zhu Zhai came to his senses after being patted by Xiao Bai and asked, "Uncle, can I see the letter she wrote to you?"

### Discussing Lu Zhengxiang (Part 2)

— Qingxue Academy

Furthermore, observing the detailed records of his negotiations with Hioki Eki each time (see Wang Yunsheng's "Sixty Years of China and Japan," section on Twenty-One Demands), totaling tens of thousands of words, filled with rivalry and exhausting arguments, prioritizing matters and responding flexibly, his meticulousness and talent were beyond the reach of mediocre individuals. (Although Vice Minister Cao also attended, he could only occasionally contribute a few words, directing his attention to Obata, the counselor accompanying the other side.) Since he handled the treaty single-handedly, it is possible to call him the "leader" of "traitors." According to normal theory, Lu's merits and demerits seem to be a great contradiction. However, examining the evolution of history, Lu's two major actions before and after taking responsibility were actually contradictory yet complementary. Without this, it would not have been possible to guide the revolution against the powerful neighbor after their modernization, leading to its downfall. (The relationship involved is a long story, which cannot be elaborated here; but those who recognize the times can easily understand that the "driving force" of revolutionary diplomacy is like the mutual use of positive and negative electricity.)

"Merit" or "demerit," "loyalty" or "treachery," Lu Zhengxiang has given up everything. Yet, he has neither departed from this world nor become a devout Buddhist, but instead went to the St. Benedictine Abbey in Belgium for ascetic cultivation and practice. From 1927 (the 16th year of the Republic) to the present (1948), it has been a full twenty years, with no news. During World War II, Hitler ravaged all of Europe, and Belgium was the first to bear the brunt, with constant artillery fire and immense suffering. It is hard to imagine Lu's survival. However, miraculously, in August of 1946, a year after the end of the war, European news reported that the old man had been specially awarded by the Pope for his accomplishments in spiritual practice and appointed as the abbot of the St. Peter's Abbey in Ghent. He took office in Belgium on July 10, and priests from various countries gathered to pay their respects. Not only was he unharmed, but his spiritual practice was unusually complete. This is not only beyond the imagination of the Chinese elite, but also a rare miracle among famous people worldwide.

The spiritual practice in monasteries is genuine and arduous, with strict precepts and a unity of knowledge and action. The first year is for trial study, the second year for receiving a saint's name and performing the "washing of feet" ceremony; the fourth year for being ordained as a priest and making vows, totaling three great vows: (1) "Poverty" (Paunxete), (2) "Chastity" (Chastete), and (3) "Obedience" (Oberssonce). Lu observed them all, consistently for more than ten years. The monks of various countries in the monastery are completely equal and mutually helpful, without national boundaries, racial boundaries, class distinctions, or prejudices, truly a model of the world's people. Lu, a man of great fame, position, wealth, and honor, concealed his tracks and practiced in seclusion, from his prime to old age, consistently. According to the sacred records of Sakyamuni Buddha, a prince of a king saw through the vanity of the world, abandoned wealth and honor, and achieved enlightenment, becoming an extraordinary and outstanding person. However, that was an ancient event, only seen in records, whereas Lu is a real person existing in modern times, truly rare and valuable.

Lu was a man full of emotion. The death of his beloved wife (of Belgian nationality) grieved him deeply, which was also one of the reasons for his monastic life. However, he cherished his mentors (Xu Wensu Jingcheng) and friends throughout his life. Such virtue and friendship are rare in the world!
