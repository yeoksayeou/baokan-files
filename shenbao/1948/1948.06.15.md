### Completion of Policy Consultation; President Weng to Give Comprehensive Reply Today; Legislators Urge No More "Headache Treatment for Headaches"

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Weng Wenhao will give a comprehensive reply at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th regarding the inquiries made by legislators on his administrative policies. After the adjournment of the Legislative Yuan at 6:30 PM on the 14th, he invited the heads of various ministries and commissions to his official residence for dinner to discuss the opinions of the legislators and the content of the comprehensive reply on the 15th, which concluded around 8:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Legislative Yuan members' inquiries regarding the Executive Yuan's policy report, which took place over three days on the 11th, 12th, and 14th, involved 222 written and oral opinions. On the 14th, requests to speak were rejected by the meeting, bringing the heated and extensive inquiries to a close. All written records of the inquiries, which have already been sent to the Executive Yuan for individual written responses, will be followed by President Weng giving a comprehensive oral reply at the 12th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th. It was also decided at the meeting on the 14th that if the members are not satisfied with the reply, they can submit further written inquiries, to which the Executive Yuan will provide written responses. President Sun also explained that the Executive Yuan's policy report and the legislators' inquiries were based on Article 57, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, which states that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and no resolution is required.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The 11th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 14th, continuing the inquiries into Premier Weng's administrative policies. The number of attending members was not as enthusiastic as in the previous two meetings, and the content of the speeches consisted more of political views than inquiries, with very few new or unique perspectives being raised. However, Premier Weng and the heads of various ministries and commissions still listened patiently with great endurance. At the beginning of the morning session, after the minutes of the previous meeting were approved, President Sun reported on three provisional motions regarding procedures. The first motion was to immediately cease accepting applications for speeches and to proceed with those remaining from the previous day. The second motion was that written inquiries would no longer be read aloud but would be sent directly to the Executive Yuan for written responses, both of which were approved with applause. The third motion was to cease the inquiries and submit the members' opinions to the various committees for discussion, but it was not considered due to legal incompatibility. Oral speeches then resumed. Yin Shuxian believed that stabilizing prices should be one of the focal points of the administrative policy and inquired why health administration was not mentioned. Wu Shipeng, He Xinghan, Yang Baolin, Niu Jianchu, Yu Ruzhou, Miao Qiping, Deng Zhengtao, and others raised opinions on military suppression of the rebellion. Wu also inquired about the criteria for personnel selection. Huang Yuren inquired about three matters: (1) Given that the current situation cannot be remedied by simply treating the symptom ("treating the headache as a headache, and the foot pain as foot pain"), does the government have a comprehensive plan? (2) Going forward, the manipulation of politics by one or two individuals or families will not be tolerated. Is Premier Weng determined to pay attention to mobilizing the strength of the entire nation? (3) Is the Executive Yuan, in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, making the Ministry of National Defense fully responsible for military operations? Or will it continue to pass the buck to people outside the Yuan, allowing a transcendent head of state to become involved in military affairs? Rong Zhao pointed out that since the government cannot but acknowledge the loss of Outer Mongolia in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, why does it not establish normal diplomatic relations? Does the government have specific plans for education and construction in the border regions? Jin Shaoxian asked if the government has thorough countermeasures against the banditry that caused today's chaotic situation? How will it ensure that the suppression of the rebellion is consistent with the provisions of Article 15 of the Constitution, which states that "the people's right to subsistence, right to work, and right to property shall be guaranteed"? Ma Runxiang raised the issue of currency reform again. Lin Mingjiu and Wu Yanhuan appealed for the refugees. Huang Guoben and Zhang Liyuan emphasized that the foundation of local autonomy should be laid. By noon, about twenty members had spoken. President Sun then proposed provisional motions related to procedures from Deng Hongye and others, believing that the inquiries had been very detailed, and advocated ceasing the inquiries and having Premier Weng and the heads of the subordinate departments respond orally at the afternoon meeting. Many members agreed, suggesting that bills could be submitted to the Yuan for discussion following the rules of procedure. However, due to the firm opposition of a few members who still wanted to speak, it was decided to make a decision at the afternoon meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12:00.

### Price Frenzy in Shanghai; Why No Executive Yuan Response? A Series of Questions Accuses the Cabinet of Irresponsibility

The meeting continued at 3:30 PM. Deng Hongye revised his provisional motion and submitted it, to continue the inquiries that afternoon. Premier Weng and others were invited to attend the meeting on the morning of the 15th to reply, which was passed by the assembly without objection. Then, Wen Shiyuan and others successively expressed their opinions. Wen questioned why the liquidation of wealthy families' capital and the requisition of foreign deposits were not mentioned at all. Shan Qin asked why health administration was omitted from the report and said that the policy content was not sufficient to suppress the rebellion. Guo Zhongxing said: Since it is said that industrial production and construction will be increased, why neglect labor issues? Liu Wendao said: Strengthening the organization, training, and utilization of people's organizations at all levels is an essential element in implementing policies and should be given attention. Liu Butong raised a series of questions: The price frenzy in Shanghai, the Executive Yuan has no response, but the president sends someone to investigate; does the fact that Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Bandit Suppression, appealed directly to the president to resign indicate that Premier Weng's responsible cabinet can no longer be responsible? Is attention being paid to supporting ethnic minority autonomy in the border regions? Is the policy of selling state-owned enterprises not being reconsidered and will it continue to be implemented? Why is diplomacy only showing passive actions? Why is the attitude towards the Soviet Union not being made clear? Liu Jianqun, after pointing out the three major political illnesses of the current situation: no source of money, no way out for people, and no spirit among officials, inquired whether the financial and economic situation would continue to condone collusion and corruption between officials and merchants? Would planned education still not be implemented in education? Would the connection between production and employment in society still not be given attention? Would the government continue to neglect the fundamentals and ignore official conduct in the military and political system, and only engage in superficial talk? Du Xunruo, Liang Surong, and others raised questions about local armed forces and emphasized that attention should be paid to military-political cooperation. Xue Xingru criticized the government for having no policy on Mongolia and said: There are 22 Mongolian legislators, "We represent tens of millions of people." Zhuang Jing raised her fist and shouted to change the 5,000-year-old tradition of valuing men over women! She questioned why the new government did not appoint female cabinet members. At 6:30 PM, all inquiries were completed, and the meeting adjourned.

### Voters Warn Their Spokesman; The National Federation of Labor Believes That Legislator Sun Xiangfeng of the Labor Sector Has Lost the Labor Standpoint in His Speeches

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The National Federation of Labor issued a warning to legislator Sun Xiangfeng of the labor sector, stating that he had lost the labor standpoint in his speeches at the Legislative Yuan. It also notified the provincial and municipal federations of labor to pay close attention and supervise him. This is the first expression of democracy since the implementation of the constitution, indicating that voters are paying attention to their elected spokesmen at all times to safeguard the interests of the voters. The elected spokesmen must be careful in their speeches in parliament to avoid causing other consequences. Mr. Sun co-signed a written objection with the representatives of the capital side when the Legislative Yuan discussed the collection of temporary property tax on the 8th. The Federation of Labor believes that he was being used by the capital side and had lost the labor standpoint. Therefore, it sent a letter to Mr. Sun on the 14th, expressing its regret. The letter also stated: "I hope that you will be cautious in your words and deeds in the future, adhere to the labor standpoint, and strive for the interests of our workers." At the same time, the association telegraphed to the provincial and municipal federations of labor, explaining the association's decision on Mr. Sun's loss of standpoint in his speech. This is a warning in advance. If he does not repent, he will be impeached again. Mr. Sun is a legislator elected by the East China Federation of Labor. The National Federation of Labor hopes that the federations of labor in the provinces and cities of East China will pay close attention and supervise him.

### The US Senate Will Follow Wedemeyer's Request to Restore the Original Amount of Aid to China; Lapham Arrives in Beijing to Discuss the Use of US Aid; Sino-American Relief Material Disposal Committee to End at the End of the Month

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] The US Senate Appropriations Committee will decide on the 14th whether to restore the original amount of $338.8 million for aid to China, as stipulated in the bill for twelve months, in order to overturn the vote of the House Committee last week, which cut $170 million. Well-informed sources say that the Senate will follow Wedemeyer's appeal to restore the original amounts for aid to China and Europe. Economic Cooperation Administration Executive Director Hoffman also warned the Senate Committee that the $338.8 million stipulated in the bill for twelve months is the minimum amount of aid. Hoffman stated that cotton worth US$13 million has now been allocated to China in accordance with the recovery plan, which is part of the total amount of US$97,616,005 approved for purchase by participating countries. At the same time, the amount allocated to China has reached $26,188,000. China and the European region can also obtain industrial materials such as aluminum, copper, zinc, and lead.

[This Newspaper] Lapham, Stillman, and their party flew to Beijing yesterday morning. This trip carries a plan for the disposal of US aid materials, which will be discussed further with relevant Chinese personnel. The organization of the Nanjing Liaison Office will also be started. Lapham is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 17th, or at the latest the 21st.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Lapham, Stillman, etc., arrived in Beijing at 10 am on the 14th to discuss the use of US aid and departure for investigation matters with our side. The two will attend President Chiang's tea party for foreign guests on the afternoon of the 15th.

In addition, three members of the delegation have not yet arrived in Shanghai. If they cannot arrive by the 17th, the investigation team may be delayed until the 18th.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the issue of US aid utilization, after Zheng Daoru, Yan Jiagan, etc. consulted with Lapham, Stillman, etc. in Shanghai in recent days, both parties have put forward some information. In addition to providing information on the utilization of US aid, our side also specially explained the current economic crisis in China, hoping that US aid can be used quickly. Lapham and Stillman have a deeper understanding of the current situation in China, but because the Sino-US bilateral agreement has not yet been signed, formal utilization must be after the bilateral agreement is signed. Lapham and Hoffman are making various efforts to restore the $63 million in aid to China cut by the House of Representatives to its original amount, which will still be disbursed in twelve months. Lapham has reported some information about China to the US media. As for the principle of using US aid, the United States still hopes that China can complete its self-help plan and improve international trade to increase foreign exchange income, so that the international balance of payments will gradually balance and produce a stable economic effect.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Sino-American Relief Material Disposal Committee has been scheduled to end at the end of June and merge into the US Aid Utilization Committee. The American China Relief Work Team is also scheduled to end at the end of June.

Essay

### The Key to the Success or Failure of Currency Reform

— Su Jicang

The theater changed, and Yu Wenshi Jue Ming formed a cabinet. Everyone expected the government to have new measures in the economic and financial aspects, especially currency reform, which may enter the stage of quasi-storage theory from the stage of research and design. Bei Zuyi, the former president of the Central Bank, was sent to the United States twice, and it is said that he carried a detailed plan for currency reform to discuss with the US authorities and plead for assistance. Judging from various signs, currency reform may be the most important new economic initiative during the Ong cabinet's tenure, and its success or failure may be a major key to determining whether China's economy can be temporarily stabilized or further deteriorated in the future. We believe that the currency system is deeply and greatly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The government must have a thorough plan beforehand, and especially must have the determination and perseverance to overcome all difficulties and adhere to the end. The authorities must not regard currency reform as a temporary emergency measure in finance, used to earn small profits in the short term, and not make long-term plans in the economy. By reading the history of currency reform in various countries, we can know that the real difficulty of currency reform lies not in designing a perfect monetary system, but in how to maintain and stabilize this system. The establishment of a country's monetary system should mainly be based on the principle of "self-reliance" and cannot rely solely on external assistance. However, in the current process of brewing currency reform, we have discovered several erroneous views and dangerous tendencies:

First, some people believe that the so-called currency reform is only aimed at replacing the existing legal currency with a new currency, unifying the name and layout of the current currency, and lowering the unit to facilitate transactions and accounting. Those who take this view only pay attention to the form of currency reform and ignore the substance of currency reform - ignoring the impact that the currency system can have on the social economy. This view is incorrect. Today's currency reform in China is not only aimed at establishing a complete monetary system, but more importantly, it is to use currency reform to save the entire financial and economic crisis. In other words, we must regard currency reform as a financial and economic policy to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, restore economic normality, and correct the phenomenon of uneven distribution of social wealth. To achieve these goals, we must not only pay attention to the technology of currency reform, but also use the opportunity of new currency to replace old currency to freeze, tax, confiscate, or transfer the use of most of the assets, and stipulate various different exchange rates, applicable to all classes of people. In this way, we can achieve the following effects in finance and economy. (1) Reduce the amount and speed of currency circulation; (2) Increase national treasury revenue; (3) Enrich production and construction funds; (4) Correct the uneven distribution of wealth caused by inflation. Frankly speaking, when talking about currency reform in today's China, it is of little significance and will never succeed if it is not used as a means to save the financial and economic crisis.

Second, the current inflation in China has reached an extremely dangerous stage, and the social economy is on the verge of total collapse. If currency reform fails, the serious consequences are truly unimaginable. Therefore, currency reform is only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. We will not talk about currency reform if we do not talk about it, otherwise we must use the greatest determination and courage to stabilize the value of the new currency, which is the key to the success or failure of the entire reform work. To stabilize the value of the new currency, the government must take the following parallel measures when starting currency reform: (1) Collect and redeem all gold, silver, and foreign currencies owned by Chinese people, and use long-term, low-interest government bonds to borrow deposits from Chinese people abroad to enrich the reserve of the new currency; (2) Encourage exports, restrict imports, strive for remittances from overseas Chinese, and reduce all unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures to seek a balance in international payments; (3) Expand and increase the collection of taxes (profit tax, inheritance tax, land price tax, land value increment tax, etc.), especially the long-awaited property tax must be earnestly implemented. At the same time, in terms of reducing expenditures, we should drastically reduce the number of troops, abolish unnecessary administrative agencies and inefficient state-owned enterprises to seek a balance in the current financial revenue and expenditure; (4) Strictly implement the budget and final account system; Make public finance transparent, issue currencies cautiously, publish issuance figures regularly, and publicly inspect the issuance reserve to strengthen people's confidence in the new currency; (5) Strengthen the central bank so that it can effectively take on the responsibility of managing currency, controlling foreign exchange, and regulating finance. It is inevitable that the implementation of the above measures will be subject to many constraints, but at this time when the crisis of total economic collapse is imminent, if the government still has the awareness to save itself and save the people, then it should come up with the spirit of "a brave man breaking his wrist" and "killing relatives righteously"!

Third, foreign aid is naturally beneficial to a country's currency reform, and therefore obtaining foreign aid is also necessary. However, foreign aid can only be utilized and not relied upon, because foreign aid is not inexhaustible, and the acquisition of foreign aid is not unconditional. If we do not have a self-reliant solution, needless to say, 300 or 500 million US dollars will not be enough to consume, even 1 billion or 800 million US dollars will not last long. At the beginning of our victory, didn't we also have 800 or 900 million US dollars and 5 or 6 million taels of gold? However, how long did it take before the national treasury became empty and we relied on issuing banknotes and borrowing money to survive. The authorities seem to be placing the hope of currency reform entirely on US loans, and are rarely making active innovative preparations in the domestic economy and finance. We feel that this is not like reforming the currency system, but just wanting to use this to obtain a foreign debt to tide over the current financial difficulties. If our observation is correct, then the future of currency reform is difficult to be optimistic.

### Around the Dragon Boat Festival - Miscellaneous Notes from Changzhou: Famine Year, Thin Wheat Ears; Chaotic World, Fragile Life and Death

[This Newspaper, Wujin, 13th] Before the Dragon Boat Festival, the wheat ears were at a critical moment of growth, and suddenly there was a rainstorm. The next morning, the weather was clear and the sun was as hot as fire. The young wheat wilted under this one wet and one scorched condition. This year is a genuine year of wheat famine, and farmers are sighing.

Once the Dragon Boat Festival passed, the price of rice went straight from the 8 million mark to the 9 million mark. On the morning of the 13th, the black market was already 10 million per stone. Unscrupulous grain merchants were secretly laughing. Thousands of stones of white rice are transported out every day, transported to this inexplicably named area of northern Jiangsu. Since last winter, the price of rice has always exceeded Wuxi, and even Shanghai. The direction of transportation has reversed from Shanghai and pointed to the northwest. In the future, the rice in Shanghai and Wuxi may flow back to Changzhou, but this loophole has not been noticed.

Bai Guoliang, a farmer from Linggang Township outside the East Gate, is 28 years old this year. On the afternoon of the 12th, he went to the field to cut wheat, when an inexplicable bullet flew over, entered his back and exited his abdomen. He screamed, fell in a pool of blood, and died immediately. It is said that the bullet was fired by a certain unit practicing target shooting. The villagers were weak and unable to negotiate, so Bai Guoliang just flew away in vain!

Zhou Zugen, who runs a small restaurant in Xijie, Qishuyan, is honest and sincere. He was working in the restaurant on the Dragon Boat Festival when a strange guest suddenly came. Just as he was receiving the guest, the guest picked up a kitchen knife on the table, and without saying a word, chopped at Zugen. Immediately, blood flowed like a fountain. He frantically shouted for help. Neighbors rushed over and snatched the kitchen knife. Zugen was seriously injured and fainted, while the murderer did not say a word and frequently foamed at the mouth. He was like an idiot, and his origin was unknown. Yesterday, he was sent to the city for interrogation, but nothing was found out. It is truly "God knows"!

Pan Xiyuan and Pan Xilin, hooligan residents of Meigang Township, usually do not engage in honest work. They extort the villagers and commit all kinds of evil. Recently, they coveted Wu Ruichang, a resident of the same place, who had a little savings, so they pretended that Wu's wife was not his first wife, intending to extort money. When they failed, they colluded with Qian Xisheng, the head of the township, and illegally detained Wu's wife and Wu's friend, subjecting them to severe torture and hanging, causing them to be covered in bruises, and detaining them for four days. Wu had no choice but to file a complaint with the Self-Defense Force. The case is currently under investigation. The countryside is truly dark and without sunlight. (Our reporter Li Tianxing)

### Smuggling Between Hong Kong and Shanghai is Rampant

[United Press, Hong Kong, 14th] Reports say that although smuggling between Hong Kong and Guangdong has gradually subsided, smuggling between Hong Kong and Shanghai is becoming more rampant. A large smuggling company, each time it smuggles, the value of the goods reaches HK$2 million. The company pays the consignor a full deposit for the goods. After the goods arrive safely in Shanghai, they ask to retrieve the deposit, with an additional 70% to 100% of the shipping fee.

### Many Barren Lands and Few People in Hede Town, Northern Jiangsu

[This Newspaper, Huaiyin, 12th] The suppression war in northern Jiangsu has come to an end. After more than a month of encirclement and suppression by the two powerful armies of the National Army, the entire Second Column of bandits has been routed back to southern Shandong after suffering heavy blows. At present, only the remnants of the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns of bandits remain in the northern Jiangsu area, wandering in the coastal area and the Hongze Lake area, with no more ability to move. For the past half month, the reporter has followed the army deep into the bandit area, traveling between the Sheyang River Basin and the Shu River Basin, and entering the old nest of Hede Town, which has been occupied by bandits for more than ten years. Along the way, I saw farmers rushing to harvest wheat under the protection of the National Army, and saying that this year's wheat harvest is the best in twelve years. The deeper I went into the bandit area, the more barren land there was, and the fewer people there were in the rural areas. For dozens of miles of marching, there was no trace of human habitation, and only broken buildings and ruins were seen. The area east of the Tongyu Line was originally a very good reclamation area, but now there are thousands of acres of weeds. Hede Town has only 600 elderly and weak residents. Many of the original factories had their machinery dismantled by the Communist bandits. Everywhere it shows the Communist bandits' means of only caring about destruction and not construction, and being hostile to the people. The hanging of the Soviet flag in the bandit area and the forced cultivation of opium by the people between the Lian and Shu areas further reveal the Communist bandits' dangerous scheme of selling the country and poisoning the people.

### Dr. Song Guobin Discusses Yang Mei

[Our Correspondent in Jiangdu, 12th] Song Guobin, former professor of physiology at Aurora University and chairman of the Shanghai Medical Association, is deeply interested in Yang Mei's nine-year fasting issue. He believes that such news has historical precedents and is possible, and does not violate science. His views are particularly valuable, and are hereby published as follows:

Yang Mei's fasting has lasted for nine years, and has been reported extensively, causing a stir both at home and abroad. Some believe it is bizarre and unbelievable, violating science and impossible to believe. Others see it as an unprecedented miracle, a once-in-a-millennium event with research value. The Chongqing Municipal Health Authorities conducted tests, proving: (1) She has indeed not eaten for three weeks, only drinking a small amount of clear water daily. (2) Her weight and body temperature have not shown a significant continued decline. (3) She has not had a bowel movement in three weeks, only urinating a few times. (4) Her body is thin, but there are no signs of exhaustion. (5) Her life is leisurely, with no strenuous work. I would like to briefly express my views on this as follows:

There are two types of fasting: complete fasting and incomplete fasting. Complete fasting means absolutely no food intake. In this case, the body temperature will drop daily, and the weight will decrease. When the weight decreases by 40% and the body temperature drops to 23 or 24 degrees, death will occur immediately, with no hope of survival. Incomplete fasting involves gradually reducing food intake until only water and a small amount of fruit are consumed daily. The weight and body temperature will also gradually decrease, but will stop at a certain level. This is because the intake of water and fruit can maintain the minimum metabolism. This type of incomplete fasting is also known as "bi gu" (avoiding grains), or "jue li" (abstaining from grains). Yang Mei's fasting probably belongs to this category. In ancient times, those who sought immortality would sit quietly in the deep mountains, eating only a few fruits a day and still maintain their lives. This is not without reason. When one is still and without thought, the body's consumption and needs are reduced to a minimum. Fruits and water also contain considerable nutrients. The body has an adaptive function, and over time, this minimum nutritional value can supplement its minimum life needs. Therefore, while achieving immortality is impossible, abstaining from grains is not difficult. Mo Youzhi [a Qing Dynasty scholar] wrote an ancient poem in his "Shao Ting Yi Wen" about a widow in her thirties who, after her husband's death, vowed to abstain from grains, drinking only a small amount of water daily. She lived like this for fifty years and died at the age of eighty. There are historical precedents, it is not absurd or unbelievable, and it is possible and does not violate science.

He will wait until there is a conclusion to the examination and research on Yang Mei's fasting before considering it. Also, Yang Mei has only urinated once since moving to Jiulongpo. It is reported that Yang Mei lives alone on the second floor, while female police officers and nurses live downstairs.

### ### Two Cases of Communist Espionage Agencies Cracked in Beiping, 57 Male and Female Communist Criminals Arrested

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The city's security authorities successively cracked two underground organizations in Beiping belonging to the Communist Party's Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Public Security Administration in late May. The hidden Communist spies distributed in the Beiping-Tianjin area have all been arrested, totaling 57 male and female criminals, making it the most important case cracked this year. The Beiping Garrison Headquarters today continued to release the details of the entire case as follows:

Source of Clues: In January of this year, the security authorities received reports from within the Communist Party that the Communist Party's Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau had dispatched a senior official, Yang, to Beiping to arrange underground work. He also attempted to infiltrate the Special Criminal Court to cover up espionage activities and control the court's handling of cases involving Communist spies. After receiving the report, the security authorities investigated and confirmed that Yang belonged to the system of the Communist leader Kang An and had the power to approve party members' membership and adjust the organization. The case was very important, so a surveillance network was deployed to closely monitor it in order to catch them all in one swoop. At the same time, it was learned that Chen Yinghua (also known as Minying), a female Communist spy sent by Jin-Cha-Ji, was also active in Beiping. Therefore, agents were sent to infiltrate Chen's organization with Communist Party credentials to gain her trust. They successively obtained important documents and blueprints for new wireless radios, photographed them as evidence. Our agents were also ordered to purchase and store radio equipment for the Communist Party for the purpose of setting up a radio station, and they pretended to agree, waiting for the right opportunity.

The Cracking Process: By the end of last month, the investigation was largely completed, and the crackdown was launched. After careful arrangements, action was taken at midnight on the 27th. First, the senior Communist official Yang was arrested at the Baoguang Electrical Repair Shop at No. 6, Jia, Beixin Hua Street. A list of his subordinates, personnel of party and youth league organizations, economic investigation outlines, and various other important documents and reactionary propaganda publications were found. After interrogation, he confessed to all organizational relationships. At the same time, the female Communist Chen Yinghua and her subordinates Jin Keyan, Yan Guangyu, Guo Datong, Liang Xiuwen, Ma Xitian, Yao Kuanmin, Li Baogui, Gao Xiongfei and other eight people were also arrested together. Intelligence data, manuscripts, motors, drawings, electrical materials, codebooks, maps of mining areas of the Hebei Provincial Highway Bureau, route maps for emergency repairs of the Highway Bureau, etc., were found in the homes of the respective criminals, and were taken along with the cases for detailed investigation. The following details of the above-mentioned Communist criminals' activities were learned:

Activities: The female Communist Chen Yinghua was under the command of the Communist Party's Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Public Security Administration. Jin Keyan stole our army's secret codebook and maps of mining areas of the Highway Bureau, route maps for emergency repairs. Yan Guangyu supplied military intelligence from Xuanhua. Guo Datong frequently traveled between the Communist areas and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Political Department, contacting Hu Ang, Ma Xia and others. Liang Xiuwen and Ma Xitian jointly designed and drew wireless radio diagrams, practiced sending and receiving reports, and prepared to take on telecommunications work. Yao Kuanmin contacted personnel coming and going from the Communist areas and stored radio equipment. Li Shigui and Gao Xiongfei were guided by Chen to plan and respectively take on work. All have confessed without denying. In Tianjin, those arrested included Wang Youzheng, the leader of the typewriter factory led by Huang Weiren, Wang Zhenru of the Changlu Nursery, Li Yexin of the Xinshibao, Li Tiejun, the chief clerk of the Municipal Finance Bureau, and Fang Boru and other six people. All of the above-mentioned criminals have solid evidence, either as Communist Party members or in contact with the Communist Party, and have also confessed. There is also Ma Junwu, a Communist Party member who is currently a prosecutor in the local court. He participated in the Special Criminal Court and was introduced by him, and he came to Beiping to contact Yang, and was also arrested. In total, 57 male and female Communist criminals have been arrested successively. The investigation of this case has come to an end for the time being, and the entire case will be transferred to the court for trial.

### Japanese Cabinet in a Precarious Situation, Huge Budget Strongly Opposed, Ashida Hopes US Aid Will Arrive Soon

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Most official sources believe that Ashida's coalition cabinet has begun to waver due to facing a series of difficulties, and may collapse before the US aid to help Japan's economic recovery arrives. Ashida personally hopes that this fund, totaling billions, can be disbursed to Japan before July 1st.

The Ashida cabinet had earlier encountered strong opposition with its unprecedentedly huge budget for 1948-49. This budget, totaling 400 billion yen, will therefore lead to universal price increases, such as train tickets increasing by three and a half times, and postage and telephone charges increasing by four and a half times. The political attack on Deputy Prime Minister Nishio has further plunged the Ashida cabinet into trouble. Some opposition members of the Diet have requested the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office to take action against Nishio, accusing him of violating the election law because he accepted a donation of 500,000 yen before last year's election and did not register with the authorities. However, under the current legal procedures, if the prosecutor intends to prosecute Nishio, he must first obtain the prime minister's approval.

The Ashida cabinet has recently faced another labor problem. The Public Utility Workers' Union, which has one million members, has requested the government to increase the basic salary to 3,200 yen per month [equivalent to 40 US dollars], an increase of 2,000 yen from the current level. Observers generally believe that the government cannot accept this.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 14th] According to reports in Tokyo newspapers this morning, Prime Minister Ashida has decided to submit his resignation in the near future. Although the superficial excuse for his resignation is the Nishio incident, the main reason is the fierce opposition from the Democratic Liberal Party, led by Yoshida, to the budget currently being discussed in the Diet.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese Minister of State Sadakichi Ichimatsu said in Osaka today that the Nishio issue will naturally cause a cabinet reshuffle. If this reshuffle cannot proceed smoothly, it is feared that the Diet will have to be dissolved and a new election held. In short, whatever the method, it must be decided within the next two or three days.

### Main Japanese War Criminals to Be Sentenced in August, Gallows Being Built in Sugamo Prison, Strict Prevention of Escape or Suicide by Any of the Criminals

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Four gallows are currently being built in Sugamo Prison in Japan. Allied officials have also taken all possible preventive measures to prevent Tojo and other major Japanese war criminals from escaping or committing suicide before hearing the verdict of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. It is generally expected that this historic verdict will be announced in early August. It is reported that the publication procedure for this verdict and the judgment will follow that of the Nuremberg Tribunal for German war criminals.

### Japanese Peace Treaty Issue Indefinitely Shelved

[United Press, Washington, 14th] It was announced on the 14th that the issue of the Japanese peace treaty has been delayed for so long that people have almost forgotten about it, and there is no hope of a resolution before the end of the year or even next year. Reliable sources said that unless there is a major breakthrough in the differences between the East and West, a peace treaty with Japan cannot be considered anytime soon. Although factors other than the "Cold War" can still hinder a formal Far East peace conference, officials here feel indifferent about initiating the Japanese peace treaty, and the issue has been shelved indefinitely.

### Philippine Newspaper Questions US Support for Japan, Believing It Is a Revival of the Co-Prosperity Sphere Dream

[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] The Manila Times published a sharp editorial directly questioning the US State Department's explanation of "why Japan's economic recovery must be supported to self-sufficiency," stating: "What 70 million Japanese people have obtained is something that the other billion or so people in Asia have not." The newspaper continued, "Most of East Asia's resources are outside Japan, and most of East Asia's people are also outside Japan. If the plan to rebuild Japan's economy could be turned to rebuild the vast area of East Asia, it would have a better impact on the economic stability of the Far East, and would also provide fairer treatment to the various related ethnic groups, otherwise, it will bring endless disasters." The newspaper added: "Konoe is dead, but his spirit remains, even in the US State Department. And Konoe's dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is still alive and well, right next to the south side of the White House."

### Spellman Returns to New York, Discusses Impressions of Visiting Japan

### Congress Expected to Approve West German Agreement, France's Government Position Improves, De Gaulle Condemns Schuman Cabinet's Incompetence

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Schumann's government's struggle to get Congress to approve the London Six-Power Conference resolution is showing increasing promise after stepping up off-site activities over the weekend. It is expected that when Bidault responds to the debate in Congress on Tuesday or Wednesday, he will be able to overcome congressional doubts about the Six-Power Agreement with a more positive attitude than last Friday.

Bidault argued that the London Conference resolutions must be accepted as is, while Prime Minister Schumann, who is more politically experienced, argued that France must reserve the opportunity to continue consultations with Western powers when interpreting or applying the London Conference recommendations. Schumann also confirmed that there were indeed some ways to make the French people feel that France was not in danger of being invaded.

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] De Gaulle gave a speech in Nevers, central France, today, pointing out that the London Six-Power Conference agreement has exposed the weaknesses of the Schumann government. He said that this agreement is nothing less than another warning to France, proving that officials in the current French regime are trying to get France to accept unnecessary concessions. These concessions will prevent France from obtaining what it deserves, and will also prevent France from contributing to European peace.

In view of the mutual accusations between the Jewish and Arab sides of violating the local ceasefire order, Bernadotte issued another statement on Rhodes Island today, stating: "The accusations against all parties are being studied. Initial acts of violence during the ceasefire were expected. What can be asserted is that none of the incidents of violence after the ceasefire took effect were of a serious nature. I have asked the Arab side not to take decisive action unless absolutely necessary. Everyone hopes that the ceasefire will be fully effective, and taking a general offensive now will inevitably abolish the purpose of all previous negotiations. I have assured the Arabs that if they suffer losses, the Jewish side will be made to compensate them, and I have given the same assurance to the Jewish side.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 14th] The Israeli Official Gazette announced today that US officials serving as UN truce observers have brought about a final ceasefire in northern Palestine.

### Supporting Japan's Economic Recovery: The Johnston Plan Contents Include Reducing Reparations and Foreign Investment

[United Press Tokyo, 13th] Five leading American businessmen have laid the groundwork for an American plan for Japan's economic recovery, which can be implemented regardless of whether a peace treaty with Japan is signed. This plan is titled "Report on the Economic Status and Future of Japan and Korea, and Necessary Measures to Improve Japan-Korea Relations," totaling fifty-one pages. It is the result of a two-week visit to Japan and Korea by Johnston (Chairman of Chemical Bank & Trust Company), Hoffman (Chairman of Studebaker Corporation), Lawley (New York Banker), and Scotcha (a prominent New York textile industrialist) at the end of April this year. This delegation to Japan and Korea was led by US Under Secretary of the Army Draper, but he did not sign the report. Hoffman was subsequently appointed as the administrator of the US foreign aid program.

Three Prerequisites

The Johnston Report is more extensive than the previous six industrial surveys of Japan, covering the entire scope of Japan's recovery, from reducing Japanese reparations to the hope for foreign investment in Japan. This recommendation is based on the following three prerequisites:

(1) An industrialized Japan is an economic and strategic asset to the United States.

(2) Japanese self-sufficiency could reduce the US burden by $400 million annually.

(3) Japan's becoming an exporting nation can assist in the recovery of the entire Far East.

Six Recommendations

For the above purposes, the report recommends:

(1) Increasing Japan's current export levels by eight or nine times, so that Japan can pay for imported food and raw materials, which is necessary to maintain a "reasonable standard of living" in Japan.

(2) Japan should be encouraged to build ships and purchase or lease ships to increase its maritime transport. The current ban on Japan building ships over 6,000 tons should be lifted.

(3) Trade between Japan and its former enemy country, China, should be restored for the mutual benefit of both parties.

(4) Japan should obtain food or other raw materials from its neighboring countries, as it did before the war. Therefore, officialdom regarding Japan's foreign trade should be reduced, so that Japanese merchants can directly contact foreign commercial firms.

(5) The final settlement of reparations should be the provision of war factories and equipment worth $280,561,750 to the victorious nations. This compensation is converted at an exchange rate of four Japanese yen to one US dollar in 1939.

According to the report, if this recommendation is implemented, the total amount of factory equipment and machine tools provided for reparations will be lower than the level proposed by Overseas Consultants, Inc. In other words, this recommendation will be the lowest among the Japanese reparations proposals.

(6) Due to the instability of the Japanese currency, establishing an exchange rate for the Japanese yen is impossible, and the "military exchange rate" of 50 yen to one US dollar should be revised and applied to new foreign investments.

A Careful Report

The report also cautiously advises that any foreign investment in Japan should be subject to "substantial supervision" by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and the Japanese government, to protect investors from discriminatory tax laws and the encompassing of commercial firms.

Regarding assisting Japanese exports, the report emphasizes that the more loans to Japan, the better, so that Japan can purchase raw materials and sell manufactured goods abroad.

After Japan signs a peace treaty, Japan should pass laws to attract foreign investment.

The report also points out that Japan's historical role is that of an exporting nation. It also advocates that Japan use US cotton to make cotton textiles for sale in the US market, but this step has been fiercely opposed by US cotton textile manufacturers.

The report does not list the measures that the United States should take, but strictly orders the Japanese government to balance its budget. Japan has been in deficit on its budget since 1930-1931, and the main reason for Japan's inability to balance its budget is the continuous inflation that dominates today's economic situation.

The Korean Issue

The report concludes by stating that the future of the Korean economy depends on the development of experienced industrial leaders and technical personnel, as Korea lacks such talent due to forty years of Japanese imperialist rule. The solution to this problem is to hire high-level American consultants, but this is not easy, so the Korean government should seek to obtain technical and guidance talent from Japan.

### Grain Chiefs Arrive in Shanghai to Discuss Suppressing Rice Prices: Report at a Press Conference Held at the Municipal Government Yesterday; Government Decides to Continue Rice Rationing; Shanghai Market Supply is Ample, No Need to Panic

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Minister of Food Kuan Chi-yu, due to the recent drastic fluctuations in grain prices in this city, was ordered by Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan to come to Shanghai yesterday to discuss ways to suppress prices with Mayor Wu and Ku Fang. Minister Kuan and Mayor Wu held a press conference at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 5 pm yesterday. Minister Kuan reported that the government has decided to continue the food rice distribution for Shanghai citizens. The government's current rice reserves are ample, the source is absolutely no problem, and there is confidence in controlling rice prices, so it is hoped that citizens will not panic and will cooperate with the government.

Minister Kuan first clarified that the key to the food problem lies in "quantity" and "price": (1) In terms of rice quantity - does the government have enough food rice for Shanghai citizens to eat? The current facts prove that the government's rice reserves are sufficient. The rice ration amount for July should be 500,000 piculs, and the rice owned by the municipal treasury has exceeded this number. Therefore, the citizens' panic should be eliminated. (2) In terms of rice prices - the recent fluctuations in rice prices have been entirely caused by public panic, because citizens doubt whether the government will continue rice rationing after July. Now that the government has decided to continue, rice prices will definitely stabilize. Minister Kuan believes that the current rise in rice prices is an occasional phenomenon, and he guarantees that the government has absolute confidence in controlling rice prices.

### Issue Written Statement

Minister Kuan left in a hurry after speaking for only ten minutes yesterday due to other important matters, and reporters could not even get a chance to ask questions. He issued a pre-printed written statement, the content of which is as follows: "Recently, Shanghai's grain prices have fluctuated. I was ordered by Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan to come to Shanghai to have detailed discussions with Mayor Wu and all parties. Currently, new wheat has already entered the market, autumn rice planting is even more widespread and good, and US aid purchases of foreign rice and wheat are arriving in China one after another. Although there are other related factors in commodity prices, this phenomenon should not occur. The distribution of food rice to Shanghai citizens has been successful for four months, and the government has decided to continue it, and will hold meetings to review and improve it, striving to achieve the purpose of rational distribution. In addition, more than 550,000 shih (units of dry measure) of grain sources have been raised for Shanghai's July ration, and preparations are sufficient, so there is absolutely no problem. In addition, Shanghai's food supply for the above rationed grain and the supply of grain for public education projects has reached about 70% of the total demand of Shanghai. In addition, there are also a considerable amount of flour and miscellaneous grains, so there is absolutely no need to worry about food for Shanghai citizens. If there is any deliberate manipulation or price gouging, the Mayor Wu has already discussed countermeasures to stabilize prices and will coordinate the handling of it at any time."

### Director Jen Personally Supervises Rice Prices in North and South Markets

Mayor Wu announced at the reception yesterday that in order to accurately suppress rice prices, the authorities have consulted with the chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee and decided that from today, Director Jen will personally go to the north and south rice markets every day to closely monitor rice prices. If rice prices continue to rise, the government has decided to release large quantities of rice when necessary. Mayor Wu firmly believes that after the news of the government's decision to continue rice rationing is officially announced today, rice prices will definitely be suppressed. He also stated that the government has great determination regarding the rice rationing policy. The rationing date will not only be one or two months, but will be maintained for at least four months or more.

### Social Bureau Discusses Fundraising for Relief Special Donations: Business Community Expresses Willingness to Assist to the Best of Their Ability, and Should Start with Wealthy Capitalists First

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Social Bureau convened more than thirty responsible persons from the local business community yesterday morning to discuss the issue of fundraising for relief special donations. According to the attendees, they will definitely assist the government to the best of their ability in the relief special donations. However, under the heavy burden of taxes and donations today, the business community is already overwhelmed. A donation amount of 850 billion is too large, and it will be difficult to meet the amount by the end of June. It should start with wealthy capitalists first, and the business community will strive to follow behind.

As for the fundraising targets for the relief special donations and the standards for auditing donation amounts, the municipal government has formulated them, and the following are excerpts: Fundraising targets: (1) People who have held or currently hold important military and political positions and are wealthy should take the lead in making donations to set an example. (2) The fundraising targets of the fundraising committees in each fundraising district should be based on the following standards: 1 Those who have managed well and are wealthy during the War of Resistance and the Suppression of the Rebellion, 2 Major merchants and wealthy individuals, 3 Corporate legal entities with strong financial resources and developed business, (3) Any natural person with more than 5 billion in family assets must donate at least one-tenth of their total family assets, and any legal person with assets worth more than 10 billion must donate at least one-twentieth of their total assets. (4) If any designated donor has any objection, they may request the fundraising committee of the relevant district to re-examine it, but if the fundraising committee believes after review that the donor has the ability to bear the burden, they should still pay the full amount. (5) The fundraising committees of each district should use effective methods to raise funds. (6) In addition to sending staff and entrusting investigations, each fundraising committee should also encourage whistleblowing.

### Gas Station on the Bund Changes Hours of Sale

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The congestion at gas stations has been unprecedented recently, especially in the area near the Bund. Due to the rush of vehicles refueling, traffic during daily office hours has become even more difficult. The Municipal Utilities Bureau and the Municipal Police Bureau jointly issued a notice to all gas stations in this area yesterday, stipulating that the time for selling gasoline must start from 3 pm from today onwards, in order to avoid increasing traffic difficulties during office hours in the morning and afternoon. However, many vehicles were unaware of this new regulation in advance yesterday and still went to the gas station early in the morning. As a result, they all had to wait until 3 pm. Therefore, the vehicles parked along the streets of Chung-cheng East Road, Szechuan Road, and Honan Road formed a long queue, and the congestion was even worse than in the past. It is hoped that the new measure will have an improved effect after it is known to the public from today onwards. The gas stations that will implement this new measure are: Texaco Gas Station at 157 Tibet Road Central, Texaco Gas Station at the intersection of Honan Road and Foochow Road, Asia Gas Station at the intersection of Szechuan Road and Chung-cheng East Road, Asia Gas Station at 85 Nanking Road East, Mobil Gas Station at 11 Szechuan Road, Mobil Gas Station at the intersection of Szechuan Road and Chung-cheng East Road, and Mobil Gas Station at 119 Soochow Road.

### Anti-Support Japan Parade: Eight-Point Interrogation; Mayor Announces Final Deadline

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu learned yesterday that the Student Self-Government Association of Chiaotung University did not intend to respond to the second letter of inquiry issued by the Municipal Government, and expressed its willingness to accept summons, but proposed two conditions, and was deeply dissatisfied. He made some criticisms at the press conference yesterday afternoon. Wu said: The eight-point inquiry I raised are the simplest factual questions. If Chiaotung University does not respond, it is tantamount to publicly acknowledging that the anti-American support for Japan parade was manipulated behind the scenes, a small number of people hijacked the public, and engaged in a planned conspiracy to disturb public order in the name of patriotism. If the students are indeed out of pure patriotic sincerity, they will definitely be able to answer candidly. He guarantees absolute openness and will disclose the reply in various newspapers. Wu also announced that this Saturday is the final deadline.

### Trial Will Definitely Be Public; Measures Will Be Announced Separately

Regarding the Chiaotung University Student Self-Government Association's expression of "willingness to accept summons," the Mayor found it very ridiculous, because summons is originally the power of the police bureau, and there is no such thing as "accepting" or "not accepting." Even if the students are unwilling, they must be forced to "accept." As for the two conditions proposed by the Self-Government Association, one is to request a public summons. Mayor Wu has repeatedly stated that the summons will be absolutely public. However, the students' second point, "allowing students from various schools who participated in the anti-American support for Japan parade to testify," Wu believes is another attempt to make an issue out of it. He said: During the court hearing of the last Shang Fa incident, hundreds of students gathered outside the court to listen, and as a result, they shouted slogans and sang the song "You, you bad thing." Fearing the recurrence of this phenomenon, the second point proposed by the students is difficult to approve. However, Wu said that there are other public measures that will be announced before the summons in the future.

### Detailed List Existed Long Ago

Mayor Wu finally reported that the Municipal Government has given a list to Chiaotung University, instructing them to circle the names of those who supported the parade next to the names of the representatives of each department, for investigation. However, Wu expressed doubt about whether Chiaotung University can do it. He said: "It doesn't matter whether they circle them or not. I already have a detailed list of the initiators. I am engaging in a war of nerves with them to see where the professional communist students will escape to?"

### Criminals Captured in the Parade Will Be Escorted to the Special Criminal Court for Trial

On the 5th of this month, the Songhu Garrison Command captured a suspicious person similar to a soldier from the ranks of the "Anti-American Support for Japan" parade launched by some college students in the city. He joined the ranks and shouted loudly to command. He has been interrogated by the department, and various facts about participating in communist work were found in his diary. According to the confession, another suspect, Chen Kang, was captured, and many communist propaganda materials were found in his home. The department has decided to transfer the two criminals and the entire case to the Special Criminal Court for strict punishment in the next few days.

Xuan Tie-wu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, said when he met with a reporter from the Central News Agency on the afternoon of the 14th: The communist army's attempt to land has been crushed by the National Army, but their spying on the Songhu defense area is still worthy of attention. The garrisons in various places, together with the local teams, are on standby at any time. If the bandits take any further action, they will definitely not succeed.

[Reported by Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th] The communist bandits who attempted to land in Nanhui were unable to withstand the attack of the defending troops, and after going into the sea, they fled southeast to the coast of Dinghai, Zhejiang, with the intention of landing on Daishan Island. The provincial security authorities had previously ordered the Hangzhou Bay and coastal troops to take strict precautions.

### Police Bureau Launches Surprise Action: Another Foreign Exchange Racketeering Organization Busted: Even Larger in Scale Than the Lin Wang Company

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Zhang Shi, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau and Director of the Special Criminal Division, and Liu Fang-hsiung, Director of the Investigation Division of the Municipal Government, based on the results of secret investigations over the past few days, launched a surprise action yesterday to search for and arrest illegal profiteers who were engaged in foreign exchange racketeering and black market gold and banknotes. As of midnight, considerable and surprising gains had been made. According to our reporter, the scale of the private foreign exchange racketeering and the huge amount of inflows and outflows were even greater than that of the previously busted Lin Wang Company. As for the black market gold and banknotes, less was seized. More than ten suspects have been arrested in the above two parts and have been detained after preliminary interrogation yesterday. It is reported that the more famous ones are Shen, Zhou, and Lü, and the background involves a certain wealthy person. Details are expected to be officially announced today.

### Conspiracy to Incite Labor Unrest in Wuxi Fails: Communist Labor Movement Leader Arrested: Confesses to Continuously Inciting Three Trends of Labor, Academic, and Dance Unrest: Escorted to Shanghai Yesterday and Will Be Sent to the Special Criminal Court for Trial

The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has recently cracked a communist underground labor movement organization case in Beijing and Shanghai, and the leader has been arrested. According to the suspect's confession to the Police Department, the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory labor unrest, the Tongji University academic unrest, and the dance unrest that shook the city were all incited by the same group.

Recently, the Police Department received a report that the Communist Beijing-Shanghai Line Labor Movement Group planned to instigate a labor unrest in the Shin Hsin Factory in Wuxi, and the leader of the bandits planned to go to Wuxi from Shanghai to command. After Wang Chao-huai, Director of the Section, learned of this, he immediately ordered Liu Yao, the head of the Wuxi-Shanghai Section under his jurisdiction, to take strict precautions. On the morning of the 7th of this month, the cadres of the Wuxi-Shanghai Section captured bandit leader Zhu Sung-mao at Wuxi Station. After several strict inquiries, he finally confessed that he was one of the persons in charge of the labor movement on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. The bandit also confessed that the communist labor movement organization on the Beijing-Shanghai Line had more than 800 people, including more than 100 in Shanghai. The group leader was Li Cheng-kuang. The famous Shin Hsin blood case in Shanghai, the Tongji academic unrest case, and the dance girl smashing the Social Bureau case were all instigated by the main cadres of the unit. In April of this year, the group was ordered to instigate labor unrest at the Shin Hsin No. 3 Factory in Wuxi, but the matter was exposed and failed. This time, he was ordered to be responsible for the deployment, so he went to Wuxi from Shanghai at the beginning of the month, lived in a small inn next to the Shin Hsin No. 3 Factory for several nights, and had secretly completed the arrangement of the labor unrest clues with the communists lurking in the factory, and planned to launch it in the middle of the month. The bandit also confessed that the communist labor movement personnel used various identities such as shops, cigarette shops, factories, and agencies as cover to engage in academic unrest, labor unrest, and dance girl movements. His wife, Xu, is a senator of a county along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and also confessed that the head of a county government department and a factory technician are both communist cadres. Director Wang of the Police Department attached great importance to the county and specially ordered him to be escorted to Shanghai. Yesterday, under the strict escort of the railway police, he was escorted to Shanghai, and Director Wang personally interrogated him along with Section Chief Liu. When the bandit confessed yesterday, he confessed in detail the various conspiracies of the communists, and recounted his experience of joining the bandits and writing a confession. The bandit will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation within a few days.

### Understanding Fire Protection Plans: When Will They Be Realized? Residents Constantly Feel Fear for Their Safety; Insufficient Funds Hinder Equipment Expansion

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] It is said that there was once an official who conducted many fire prevention inspections. During these inspections, he often heard residents grumbling: "What danger is there in this chimney? It's perfectly fine. It's been installed here for forty or fifty years, and it has never caused a fire!" He immediately replied with profound experience: "Sir, just because a fire hasn't occurred in forty or fifty years doesn't guarantee that there will never be any danger!" Later, eight out of ten of them, forgetting this warning, experienced terrible fires in their homes.

The fact that a fire hasn't broken out in forty or fifty years is no guarantee against the sudden arrival of tragedy. Shanghai residents understand this principle, but they can't seem to remember it. Violations of building codes, storage of flammable materials, and many who, after a hard day's work, extinguish a cigarette butt before going to sleep. Fires finally break out suddenly when they least expect it.

Pacific Fire Hydrants Often Malfunction

Once a fire breaks out, the affected party, facing raging flames, naturally tries to salvage the destruction of their life's work. They call the fire department! The telephone in the fire department's control room is located in the busiest commercial district. The ring goes unanswered for a long time. By the time the fire truck arrives with its alarm blaring, the narrow streets are congested with vehicles, so the arrival time is not ideal. And when the hoses are connected, the fire hydrants often malfunction. Last year, during the large fire at the Southeast Rubber Shoe Factory on Changyang Road, the fire truck rushed to the scene, but the first hydrant nearby had a damaged axle. They switched to another, but it was filled with rocks. They switched again and found it was still blocked with rocks. Finally, they found a working hydrant three blocks away, extending the hose by 1,300 feet. The time wasted was several minutes, and the fire spread to over a dozen neighboring homes. Wise parents! According to the investigation afterward, these rocks and axles were all damaged by children! Fire inspectors cannot prevent these man-made tragedies!

A Kind of Blow, a Kind of Insult

The anxiety of those affected by the fire often leads to some abnormal behavior. If the fire truck arrives late or the water connection is slow, complaints arise, which is a blow to the firefighters. Last year, when a fire broke out at the Zhongnan Can Factory on Xin Jian Road, the fire truck arrived after the flames were extinguished, and only white smoke was rising from the roof. However, the factory firmly refused to allow firefighters to climb up and extinguish the remaining embers. This is an insult to the work of the firefighters. Another example is the large fire on Fangbang Road in Nanshi last year. After the fire truck arrived, the water supply suddenly cut off. They had to find a way to get water from outside the Nanyang Bridge. How could the raging flames wait for the long journey from the Bund to the New World? The result was the ruin of nearly a hundred households. This is the public utilities playing a joke on the fire department.

Under the temptation of "Help me, I understand!", corrupt firefighters have been successively eliminated over the past two years. Under the threat of "Criticism for gossip when entering a fire scene, blame for negligence when not entering," many good firefighters have resigned. Now, on this land with a population density of five million, the total number of firefighters is only four hundred and fifty-eight. There is a reason why we constantly feel fear for our safety! There is also a reason for the loss of over 150 billion in the eighty-four fires last month!

Replenishment is by no means something that can be done immediately.

Ultimately: insufficient funding and limited staffing prevent the fire department from expanding. Shanghai is a large metropolis with 780,000 mu of land, but there are only 329 fire hydrants. Fifty-three fire trucks are outdated, still legacies from the concession era. There are even fewer fire stations, less than one-third of the 29 police precincts. According to expert estimates, to balance the fire risk of Shanghai's vast area and population, the fire equipment should be expanded to at least: 43 fire stations, 13,658 fire hydrants, and 280 fire trucks. Then, any fire can be reached and water can be deployed within five minutes, but when will this "ideal safety plan" be realized?

There is also the problem of "people." With the current total number of firefighters, they cannot rest for 24 hours, which naturally has a significant impact on work efficiency. But it takes at least five years to train a firefighter from start to finish. Replenishment is by no means something that can be done immediately. Driver Sergeant Yu Changgen died in the line of duty last week. Another firefighter technician is lost. The authorities' deep mourning at the memorial service is enough to make people think deeply!

### Liu Deming's Identity Awaiting Verification: Garrison Headquarters Has Not Yet Started Trial

He believes that Liu is a natural person, and the Friends of the Military Society is a legal person. Whether Liu committed a crime or not involves criminal matters. As for the Friends of the Military Society, its organization is whether it is legal and whether its business hinders society, which is a matter of administrative punishment. The two are not related. It is also learned that Tang Enbo, the chairman of the society, has not yet learned the details of the case. The directors of the society are planning to find a way to report it.

### Imposition of Temporary Property Tax: Industrial Circles Telegram Request for Deferral of Discussion, Believing That Rash Implementation Will Widen the Gap Between Rich and Poor

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Industrial Association recently believed that the draft of the temporary property tax under discussion by the Legislative Yuan was not in line with the national conditions, and that rash implementation would only widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Therefore, it telegraphed the Legislative Yuan, detailing the reasons. The original text reads: "Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing, and Vice President Chen Jun: Recent reports state that Legislative Yuan members Liu Butong and others have proposed to the Yuan to request the government to immediately levy a temporary property tax to equalize wealth and save the country from peril. Reading the draft regulations, the target of taxation covers all individuals, legal persons, domestic and foreign, and the means of collection include in-kind payment. The tax rate is progressively progressive from 5% to 60%, and a 30% reward is used to entice whistleblowers. According to various sources, the head of finance has already made plans to use this to show off his financial skills, and the highest legislative body of the Constitution is also cooperating with the government to help the government's painstaking plans with a lightning-fast proposition. Since the announcement of the tax regulations, the whole country has been shocked. It is believed that the so-called equalization of wealth and saving the country from peril in the title of the regulations is not in line with the national conditions, and rash implementation will only widen the gap between the rich and the poor, and the national economy and people's livelihood will be in greater peril. The key to this is dared to be painfully stated to your Yuan. It is said that the equalization of wealth is a common facility for modern countries to eliminate social crises. The so-called wealthy people must first truly recognize them and cannot graft them to treat those who are engaged in production and have production tools as wealthy, resulting in a difference of millimeters and thousands of miles. In recent years, a small number of people have relied on special privileges and used opportunities to accumulate their wealth without restriction. It is sincerely hoped that the country will adhere to the utmost fairness, reverse its surplus to benefit the national treasury, so that the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies will be reduced, and the issuance of currency will also be limited. The national strength is cultivated, and the feelings of the people are comforted. It is a pity that these few people have already transferred their financial resources overseas and spent their leisurely years under the protection of the private property system in friendly countries. Due to the international environment and domestic situation, the country is unable to investigate and unable to sanction. In desperation, the special property tax has been changed again and again into a special relief tax, and it has ended up being evaded by the gate, losing its focus. Although it is held in various places, the effect is not obvious. The country is already in trouble, so it can only ignore everything and abandon its original intention. Occasionally, the implementation of property tax is discussed, and those who have not been able to clear the wealthy turn more targets to the whole people. It is important to know that our country has been in chaos for years. Except for a few powerful and wealthy people, the people of society have been impoverished to the point of starvation. The so-called well-off families have hundreds of millions of dollars due to the endless inflation in recent years. If they are considered rich, in addition to the house tax and rental income tax, they will be forced to sell their property to pay taxes, forcing the common people to not be able to live in peace. Even in terms of industry, there may be storage of products and the existence of production tools, but they can only be used to turn the millstone, barely enabling the production business to not be interrupted, and for the purpose of national profit-making business income tax and business tax, and to prevent the general workers from losing their jobs. If they are taken away to dedicate to the country, the entire production business will collapse, four people will lose their jobs, and they will become extremely poor, which will lead to a situation of disintegration. Who will enjoy the benefits? It is not difficult to imagine. Looking back at history, after the country has just passed through a great disaster, it will always first recuperate and rehabilitate, so that farmers can be safe in the fields and workers can be safe in the shops. I have never heard of depriving them of their production tools, borrowing from the national treasury to say that it is enough to lay the foundation of the country and to stabilize the hearts of the people. Throughout the dynasties, gatherings have always suffered the disaster of collapse. The reason why so many people were displaced in the communist clearings was that the five people were more than satisfied with their jobs. Hearing this measure, although people's hearts are disturbed, they can only wait quietly for the command. However, when the entire economy goes bankrupt, it will inevitably lead to the disaster of political collapse. The precedents recorded in history are obvious. I am deeply concerned that a single mistake will not help the country, and will instead create unforeseen consequences. What I am worried about is that I dare not keep silent. I dare to ask the presidents and all the participants in the discussion to be careful about this temporary property tax case and not to easily pass it in order to save the hearts of the people who are about to fall and to preserve the lifeline of the constitutional republic. The Shanghai Industrial Association Preparatory Committee sincerely telegraphed, hoping to be observed, cold."

### Rising Prices in Production Areas Strengthen People's Confidence, Rice Sees Unprecedented High Prices, Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes All Rise Sharply Affected by Rice Prices

The rice market saw an unprecedented surge yesterday, affected by the price increases in Xishi, coupled with the fact that the prices of all goods outside the industry continued to climb to new heights, and people's confidence was strong. Although economic commissioners went to the market to monitor transactions, people's confidence remained strong and did not decrease slightly. The opening price in the early market was astonishing. Extra high japonica rice was once quoted at 10.5 million, and white japonica rice also broke the 10 million mark, but there were few transactions. In the afternoon, the official trading price for white japonica rice and thin indica rice was 9.9 million, but it was not high-quality rice. Sheep indica rice and white yuan rice both reached 9.9 million, each rising by about 1 million. The prices of rice in the Nanshi market also increased by 1 million.

The rise in flour was very dramatic. Due to the soaring rice prices and the rising prices of all goods, people's confidence was even stronger. In addition, the China Trust Bureau suddenly stopped selling it yesterday, and the rise was like a tiger with wings. In the market, only the second-grade Shou Tao flour opened at 2.05 million. The opening price for Bingchuan flour outside the market was 3.1 million, and later rose to 3.2 million. Lao Che flour was 3.25 million, each rising sharply by 400,000 to 500,000. Large bags of bran were traded at 2.83 million yesterday, and new wheat was 4.4 million.

Coarse grains saw another sharp rise, creating endless new high prices every day. Under the skyrocketing rice prices yesterday, they saw even more frantic progress. The cargo owners' minds were firm, almost unwilling to sell. Hankou Zha beans closed at 5.5 million, a sharp increase of 700,000. The initial rise in corn was still slight, but the market became more severe later. Qidong corn closed at 6.2 million, a sharp increase of 700,000 to 800,000. High-quality mung beans rose by more than 1 million, and red sorghum rose by 400,000 to 500,000.

Tianjin sesame was taken by the gang, soaring by 2.5 million, and raw peanuts rose by 2 million.

The rise in edible oil was pervasive. The market was very active. People's confidence was stronger and stronger under the rise of various goods. Soybean oil rose by 1.6 million, and Da You soybean oil was 22.7 million. Rapeseed oil was 21.5 million, and raw oil rose sharply by 2.3 million. Jiangbei and Ji barrel raw oil directly broke the 30 million mark. Small-cart sesame oil also reached 30 million, a rise of 4 million, the largest increase. Soybean cake was taken by the Shan gang, rising by 260,000 to 270,000.

### Local Business Conditions

Wuxi [Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 14th] The market situation here has been chaotic all day, and the rise in prices has continued unabated. Rice and paddy rice are difficult to open. The door price for white japonica rice is limited to 9.5 million, and the black market outside the market is rampant, already exceeding the 10 million mark. Sheep indica rice is 9.96 million, port indica rice is 9.76 million, new wheat is 8.6 million, white wheat is 8.8 million, soybean oil has jumped sharply to 23.8 million, and the rise in flour is even more fierce and has not yet opened.

### Intensified Extra-Market Stimulation Leads to Stronger Rebound in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially weakened due to the anticipation of a high-ranking official's visit to Shanghai, prompting law-abiding investors to exercise caution. However, after 3:00 PM, a rebound began, driven by the black market outside the exchange, leading to a surge that resulted in high closing prices.

The market opened steadily in the morning due to the previous week's after-hours activity in the black market. Yong Yarn opened at 3790 yuan. Market participants were quite intimidated by the high-ranking official's visit, causing the price to retreat to a low of 3735 yuan. The extra-market activity was profitable, with ample buying interest at lower prices. Brokerage fees opened at the original price, and despite rising in the middle of the day, it struggled around 3800 yuan. Ultimately, due to the sharp rise in yarn and cloth, a new high of 3855 yuan was seen after 11:00 AM. However, small and miscellaneous stocks, except for Rongfeng, were exceptionally weak, with the noon close at 3745 yuan. Compared to the previous Saturday, Xinhua and Huafeng fell by half a percent, Zhongxing, Xinyi, and Zhabei remained flat, while other stocks showed mixed gains and losses.

In the afternoon, Yong Yarn opened at 3790 yuan and fell to a low of 3745 yuan, after which it gradually recovered. National banks showed little change, but further encouragement from the black market led to a new high of 3915 yuan at the close. Other stocks also rose sharply. Compared to the morning close, Jinglun and Huafeng rose by 10%, Yong Yarn, Xinyi, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, Tongyi, Rongfeng, and Xinhua rose by half a percent, Hengfeng, Yonggong, and Shangwu remained flat, and the rest rose slightly. Unlisted stocks outside the exchange rose slightly, up to a strong half a percent, with Cultural Bank and Dasheng remaining popular.

Government Bonds: Yesterday showed weakness. Unified C opened at 480,000 yuan and fell to a low of 440,000 yuan before leveling off slightly. Trading volume was only 3 million yuan. Compared to the previous Saturday, A, B, and C fell by 40,000 yuan each, Unified D fell by 50,000 yuan, and Type E fell by a little over 60,000 yuan.

Foreign Stocks: Yesterday's gains remained sharp. Ewo Yarn opened at 6.15 million yuan and rose steadily to close at 6.35 million yuan. The middle of the day was volatile, with repeated highs and retreats. Guangbang (Guangdong) foreign firms were buyers, while money exchangers and small investors were mostly sellers. As a result, compared to the previous Saturday, Ewo Yarn, British-American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, Yue Guang, Ewo Brewery, and Aviation Industries rose by half a percent each, while Paperboard and Steel Industries rose by 10%.

### Abundant Foreign Remittances Fail to Tighten Credit

Despite the authorities selling large quantities of goods in recent days, the influx of remittances from North China to Shanghai has made it difficult to tighten credit. On Saturday, the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee sold over 1.2 trillion yuan of yarn and cloth. This large sum was deposited with the Central Bank yesterday. However, due to the large remittances from other cities and the abundance of banker's acceptances, the net clearance of bank drafts decreased to 575 billion yuan. Individually, the Central Bank gained 708.1 billion yuan, the Bank of China lost 372.3 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications lost 122 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank lost 37.9 billion yuan, the Central Trust of China gained 227.3 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau lost 33.4 billion yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury gained 115.2 billion yuan. The large clearinghouse gained 159.2 billion yuan, the small clearinghouse lost 1.007 trillion yuan, and foreign banks gained 272.8 billion yuan.

In recent days, the Central Bank authorities, in an effort to tighten credit, have repeatedly convened meetings of senior bank officials, led by Vice President Liu Gongyun, to exchange views and review countermeasures. It is said that the authorities plan to strengthen controls on the financial sector.

### Coal Briquette Plant Prices Increase by 30%

Recently, the market price of soap has risen rapidly, doubling in just ten days. Guben Soap reached 14 million yuan per case (120 bars) yesterday, Huang Xiangmao quoted 10 million yuan, and other brands such as Guanghua also reached new highs.

The kerosene market has also been affected by rising prices across the board. The market price has surged, with 46-degree barrel oil rising from 3.56 million to 9 million yuan before being sold. Mobil and Asiatic canned oil rose from 4 million to 4.4 million yuan, with brisk trading. The price ceiling remained at 100,000 yuan per catty, but retail sales were changed to 110,000 yuan, representing an increase of about 10%.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Rise Alarmingly, Leading Fine Cloth Breaks 10 Million Mark

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a continuous influx of speculative capital into Shanghai, leading to an increasingly loose money supply. Procurement from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions remained strong, and buying from inside and outside the industry was also vigorous. Although spinning mills had begun selling, strong buying interest pushed the initial price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn to 500 million yuan. Subsequently, as scattered sellers rushed to cover their positions, buyers were willing to pay high prices, driving the market price up again to close at 524 million yuan, up 39 million yuan from the weekend. Prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by about 10%.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw surging yarn prices and a loose money supply. Procurement from Hankou, Shanxi, and the northern regions remained healthy, and dyeing factories also increased their purchases of grey cloth. The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 350,000 yuan. Subsequently, as buyers from Tianjin rushed to purchase, the market rose sharply, reaching an unprecedented high of 10.05 million yuan before closing at 10.04 million yuan, a surge of 850,000 yuan from the previous weekend. Four Gentlemen serge was very popular due to purchases from Hankou and the northern regions, rising by a substantial 1.156 million yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, Shilin cloth, and poplin also rose sharply across the board.

### Cocoon Prices Rise Steadily, Procurement Results Unsatisfactory

[Yixing, May 8th Dispatch] Since the opening of the spring cocoon market in Yixing, Liyang, Wuxi, and Changzhou, cocoon prices have been rising steadily (Yixing cocoon prices have reached 35 million yuan), and cocoon farmers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. In the Wuxi and Changzhou areas, most have already dried their fresh cocoons themselves, waiting for a higher price. Therefore, procurement by various businesses has not been enthusiastic recently, and it is expected that this year's cocoon procurement results will be difficult to be optimistic about.

### Airfreighted Cotton Should First Verify Transportation Permits

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Yarn and Cloth Control Committee yesterday again telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting it to instruct China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) to require verification of the cotton transportation permits issued by the Committee for all cotton shipments from various stations.

It is also learned that the principle is to lend 120 million yuan per dan of cocoons, equivalent to 99.207 million yuan per metric dan. Based on the estimated total cocoon production, it is estimated that 1.4 trillion yuan in silk reeling loans will be needed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. However, due to the poor cocoon harvest this year, the actual loan amount may not reach this figure.

### Exchange Certificate Transaction Fee Set at 1.25% by Designated Banks

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The responsible persons of the Shanghai Designated Banks Association held a meeting last Friday and made the following important decisions: (1) Member banks may charge importers and exporters a handling fee of 1.25% of the total exchange value for US dollar transactions. The total exchange value refers to the sum of the official exchange rate and the market price of exchange certificates. This handling fee is provisionally set at 13,000 yuan (assuming a market price of 550,000 yuan), but may be adjusted as necessary, and the brokers will be notified by the Designated Banks Association. The handling fees for other foreign currencies will be calculated based on the US dollar standard, and the conversion rate will be handled according to Central Bank Circular No. 138. No handling fee will be charged if the exchange certificate is handled by the same bank. (2) Section 2 of Article 5 of the Designated Banks Association's constitution should be amended to read: "When a member bank handles and acts as an agent for foreign exchange business, and its exchange must be transferred through another bank, in addition to deducting the handling fee as usual, another 0.5 per thousand of the 'total exchange value' should be deducted to compensate for business losses." (3) The handling fee unit prices listed in Article 7 of the constitution are as follows: 3,000 yuan (legal tender, same below) for US dollars, 6,000 yuan for British pounds, 1,000 yuan for Philippine pesos, 1,000 yuan for Thai baht, 1,000 yuan for Malayan dollars, 1,000 yuan for Dutch guilders, 1,000 yuan for Swiss francs, 500 yuan for rupees, 500 yuan for Hong Kong dollars, and 1,000 yuan for legal tender (per 100 legal francs). (4) If a customer requests separate exchange certificates, the Huichang Bank should charge a handling fee equivalent to one US dollar for each newly issued certificate, based on its total exchange value.

### President Cheng is Extremely Anxious About the Future of Jiaotong University Graduates

Hoping Jiaotong University Will Still Be Under the Ministry of Transportation

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] There are a total of 800 graduates from Jiaotong University this year, and the future of 70-80% of them has not yet been resolved. According to President Cheng Xiaogang's conversation with reporters: The school had previously sent letters to the Resources Commission and other relevant parties to contact them, but many were rejected.

### Mayor's Cup Dispute, Tung Wah Lodge Protest, Football Association and Referees Association Will Both Hold Meetings

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A dispute occurred in the Mayor's Cup football final the day before yesterday. The incident involved Tung Wah player Han Nibo punching and slapping referee Jiang Yinseng. The Football Association issued a statement yesterday claiming that Tung Wah had voluntarily forfeited its rights in the match, but Tung Wah claimed it would file a protest, leading to conflicting accounts. According to Mr. Mai Youliang, the team's protest letter has been delivered to the Football Association, and its content and reasons are the same as the letter sent to the newspapers. Jia had personally asked Shen Huichun whether the continued game would be considered official, to which Shen nodded in agreement, if Tung Wah had already forfeited, why the continue the game? But today, Shen Huichun denied that he had said the continued game was official. According to Shen Peiji of the Football Association, the game was continued entirely due to the situation with shares at the time, otherwise thousands of spectators would have demanded refunds, which would have been terrible. Then why was this situation not told to the Tung Wah players? Which gives the appearance of deception. Shen Peiji said: Tung Wah's forfeiture was based on the report of referee Jiang Yinseng. Jiang ordered Han Nibo to leave the field and continue the game, but Tung Wah refused to obey, and captain Li Yao told Jiang Yinseng that they were willing to forfeit. Who is right and who is wrong is unclear. It is said that the Football Association and the Referees Association will both hold meetings, and Jiang Yinseng intends to file a lawsuit against Han Nibo. Everything remains to be developed.

### Explanation of Lao Tzu's "Not Exalting the Worthy" Chapter

— Yan Qun

"Not exalting the worthy, causes the people not to contend; not valuing goods that are hard to obtain, causes the people not to steal; not displaying the desirable, causes the people's hearts not to be disturbed. Therefore the sage governs by: emptying their minds, filling their bellies, weakening their wills, and strengthening their bones—constantly causing the people to be without knowledge or desire, so that those who are wise dare not act. Practicing non-action, then nothing is ungoverned."

If the ruler esteems worthies and establishes standards and limits to promote them, then people will compete with each other to seek advancement, and thus there will be contention. Moreover, if people compete for advancement, they will resort to embellishment, deception, and fraud, so those promoted may not be truly worthy to assist the ruler. There are few who do not disrupt the government. Furthermore, the governance of exalting the worthy is a governance of people; when people exist, governance arises; when people are gone, governance ceases. This is not a way to be sustained. How does it compare to governing by naturalness, allowing the people to develop their talents and abilities and seek their own happiness? The ruler's job is to guide the people's talents and abilities beneficially, seeking natural progress without forcing anything. Progress is the people's own progress, governance is the people's own governance, and the people themselves manage their own progress and governance. Such progress and governance can be sustained and will not have dramatic changes of rise and fall. The so-called democratic governance of today, is it not in this? Goods that are hard to obtain are the so-called "rare objects" (see Chapter 57). It is not only rare objects that are not valued; rare talents are also not esteemed. Valuing rare objects causes people to compete for them to profit, and a thieving heart arises; esteeming rare talents causes people to compete to adorn themselves to gain promotion. Adorning oneself to gain promotion is already a form of thievery. "The desirable" are rare objects and unusual talents. If the ruler does not favor and esteem the unusual, then the people will not compete to obtain and adorn themselves. Therefore, it is said: "Not displaying the desirable, causes the people's hearts not to be disturbed." "Emptying their minds" means that the mind is not attached to things; only by not employing cleverness to pursue things can the mind not be attached to things. "And not valuing goods that are hard to obtain" and "not displaying the desirable" are also ways to cause wisdom to be restrained inward and not pursue external things. "Emptying their minds" is to receive the Dao; the Dao is not attached to things but embraces and accommodates everything. If the mind can receive the Dao, taking the Dao as its essence, then its manifestations in dealing with people and things will also be like the Dao's embracing and accommodating, without contention with others and without conflict with things. "Filling their bellies" means having enough clothing and food. The common people take clothing and food as their foundation. When clothing and food are sufficient, and they are free from the burdens of physical needs, then they can advance in the Dao—this is why the desire to "empty the people's minds" must begin with "filling their bellies." However, if the people can prepare their minds to receive the Dao, then the mind has a master, and desires do not grow, not pursuing things and initiating contention, robbery, and slaughter. Thus, heaven and earth have abundant wealth, and everyone's livelihood is sufficient, and the belly is further filled; moreover, when the mind receives the Dao, then it is compatible with others, without any sense of self and other. The wealth of heaven and earth is used to nourish each other, the affairs of livelihood are equitable, and governance can be expected to progress—this is advancing the people in the Dao, which in turn enables the people's livelihood to be sufficient and equitable and governance to progress. "Will" is where the heart is directed; the use of the Dao is supremely gentle; if where the heart is directed is in the Dao, then the will is "weak." This so-called "weakness" is what is meant by "concentrating your qi to achieve softness" (see Chapter 10)—"concentrating your qi" means focusing your emotions ("qi" means emotion, the power of life) on the Dao; "achieving softness" means achieving the ultimate use of non-action and non-contention (non-action and non-contention enable harmony and mutual assistance with people and things). "Bones" are a metaphor for the body; if one upholds the Dao without changing, then the body is firm and strong. "Will" refers to use; the essence of the Dao is supremely healthy, and its use is extremely gentle, thus achieving the effect of embracing all things without omission and circulating without danger. If people can uphold the Dao for use, then in dealing with people and things, they will be compatible and mutually supportive. The sage governs by causing the people's minds to be empty, their bellies to be full, their wills to be weak, and their bones to be strong. Ultimately, this is to make the people "without knowledge or desire" (the so-called "not to enlighten the people, but to make them ignorant" is the meaning here). What is known and desired are to adorn talents for advancement, rare goods for profit. When the people's minds are empty, their bellies are full, their wills are weak, and their bones are strong, then power, profit, fame, and position are not what they admire or pursue. Even the wise dare not play tricks to court failure. Therefore, it is said: "So that those who are wise dare not act." "Practicing non-action" summarizes what was said above: "Not exalting the worthy" is non-action in employing people; "not valuing goods that are hard to obtain" is non-action in managing wealth; "not displaying the desirable" is non-action in fame, profit, power, and position; "emptying their minds" is receiving the Dao with non-action; "filling their bellies" is providing for the nourishment of the physical body with non-action; "weakening their wills" is emulating the use of the Dao with non-action; "strengthening their bones" is upholding the essence of the Dao with non-action. Exhausting the use of non-action causes the people to be without knowledge or desire, and even the wise dare not act. Then the world is governed—non-action is the supreme action in the world. Acting through non-action and governing through non-governance are mutually related and connected, the path of the essence of the Dao manifesting its use and circulating.

### Idle Thoughts by the Lake (3)

— Gu Ou

Desire

The most real and reliable thing in life should be one's immediate awareness. But this awareness is also the most elusive and difficult to grasp. Purely from the perspective of inner awareness, life is like a great waterfall, changing and vanishing in every instant, never stopping. The present moment appears and vanishes in a flash, impossible to control or freeze. Anyone who tries to focus intently on the present moment will feel this acutely. Your mind is either racing toward the future or clinging to the past. If we call the former hope and the latter memory, it seems that life is equally divided between hope and memory. If you were to destroy all memories, it would be equivalent to erasing your entire life. However, there is also no such thing as a life without any hope for the future. Between these two, there is always some degree of imbalance. Some are dominated by memory, while others are dominated by hope. It is almost impossible to achieve a perfect balance, an equal distribution between the two. Yet, it is precisely this imbalance that creates the vast differences in human lives.

Let us say that there are two types of people in life: those who lean forward (with more hope for the future) and those who lean backward (valuing memories of the past). The most prominent characteristic of the backward-leaning type is a love of history. History is entirely a record of past human lives. Forward-leaning people are impatient with this. They are eager to move forward, eager to venture into the unknown realm of the future. They do not want reality; they want ideals. People who value history build ideals from reality, while those who are eager for the future build ideals to transform reality. Novels and plays often arise from this kind of demand. They often depict an idealized future life. However, the future is ultimately unknowable. If you constantly venture in that direction, you will feel as if there is a force, or perhaps destiny, arranging things outside of you, playing tricks on you, powerful and cold, yet also pitiable. If you believe that the past is entirely gone and does not belong to you, you should also realize how vague, intricate, and changeable the future is. Everything about the future is beyond your control, and it does not belong to you either. As your future unfolds, it will prove that your ideals are becoming less real or are gradually changing and retreating. If you stubbornly cling to your personal hopes and insist on moving forward, it will likely end in tragedy. The highest realm in all novels and plays is always tragedy.

Planting mulberry trees by the Yangtze River is highly precarious. Therefore, forward-leaning people easily turn from novels and plays to religion. Religion and the life of novels are both supported by hope for the future, but they shift the future hope even further back, essentially moving it into another world. God and heaven are fundamentally not of this world. To take this as future hope is to say that there is no longer any hope for this present world. Therefore, religion is also a tragedy, only infinitely delaying the final curtain. The life of religion is still the life of a dramatic novel, embracing future hope and plunging into the unknowable, resolutely refusing to retreat—a passionate expression of the forward-leaning human nature.

The life of history is different. It recalls the past more than it imagines the future. The past is gone, but doesn't your heart retain a piece of its memory? You want to keep these traces, and who can take them away from you? It is the real gain you have from life, which you can forever treasure in your heart, never fading. Life moves forward constantly, but it may not catch up with what it hopes for, and may even move further away from hope. Hope gradually fades, but memory gradually increases and becomes richer. Even if life gains nothing else, there is still memory, which everyone can possess peacefully without effort. It is life's only substantial gift to humanity, and you should cherish it as a family heirloom!

The national character of the Chinese people is generally backward-leaning. Therefore, the development of history surpasses that of literature, and among literature, novels and plays are the least developed. According to Chinese concepts, rushing toward the future is desire, while cherishing the past is emotion. Sacrificing the past to satisfy the future is desire, while sacrificing the future to accommodate the past is emotion. Chinese concepts value emotion over desire. In literature, there is little passionate love toward the future between men and women, but there is much deep emotion for the past. Chinese concepts call this depth, hence the saying that gentle and honest are the teachings of poetry. It is also said that carefully attending to the end and tracing back to the distant past enriches the virtue of the people. It is also said that "one death, one life, reveals the depth of friendship," as long as you do not forget the past. The dead are treated as if they are still alive. This kind of emotion is also extremely passionate and romantic, but it is not literary; it turns into ethics and morality.

Westerners' love focuses on future happiness, while Chinese love focuses on past feelings and righteousness. Westerners entrust the dead to God, while Chinese people preserve them forever in their hearts. They look down on fighting for personal future fate, they advocate accepting fate, so they often cannot break through and create new things, but they are extremely protective and conservative of the old. As long as something is coated with their memory, they always try their best to preserve it, preventing it from becoming blurred, disappearing, or changing color. This is also another kind of strong and powerful life, with all the power used deep within the heart. It is not that they have no hope for the future, but their hope focuses on what they remember. They firmly grasp the past as the basis for their future life. They give their most sincere emotions to the past. As long as you encroach on their memory, they will treat you as their life and never let go. Loyalty! Filial piety! All this comes down to this principle. At first glance, it seems like they are stubbornly clinging to one point, but in reality, they can be content in any situation. Asking them to move forward seems burdensome and difficult, but every step they take forward brings gains, never falling short. They twist the future back toward the past and turn themselves toward others, thus merging life and death, self and others into one. They do not seem to have much longing for their personal future happiness.

Backward-leaning cultures also develop religions, but they are different from the forward-leaning type. The forward-leaning type focuses on hope and prayer, while the backward-leaning type focuses on remembrance and gratitude. Like Chinese literature, Chinese religion values emotion over desire in Chinese concepts. It emphasizes repaying kindness over seeking blessings. The former is dissatisfied with the present and seeks forward, so it feels that there is a God outside, which can also be said to be a destiny or force. This further highlights life, making one feel small and even repulsive. The opposition between God and self develops into the theory of inherent evil. Backward-leaning people express satisfaction with the past and express gratitude, seeking only to do their best. The external God loses importance, and the self's position in life rises, thus developing the theory of inherent goodness. The former's God is transcendent, while the latter's God turns inward. Thus, religion becomes ethical and moral again. Each with its own imbalance, walking its own path, whether burying resentment or envying, is this not the dignity of human nature? Should not everyone dignify their own human nature?

### Wang Yangming's Theory of Child Education

— Yang Tongfang

Adapting to children's psychological needs and promoting their spontaneous activities has long become a major trend in modern educational methods. The foundation of this theory lies in the liberation of European cultural thought since the seventeenth century. Rousseau's theory of naturalism in education has had a significant impact on later generations. His book "Emile" advocates respecting children's nature, developing their free thinking, and pioneering new educational theories and methods. The traditional education that harmed human nature was thereby shaken.

For thousands of years, Chinese education has adhered to old sayings and inherited old methods, either forcibly injecting and instilling or passively prohibiting and suppressing. Neo-Confucian scholars of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties emerged, taking the cultivation of mind and the seeing of one's nature as the purpose of education. In terms of methods, they emphasized respect to eliminate desires, sincerity, and controlling private desires, focusing on static cultivation and depriving all vitality. In the minds of those solemn and sanctimonious Neo-Confucian scholars, there was no such thing as "developing free thought and will." Only Wang Yangming, a visionary educator who emerged in the mid-Ming Dynasty, pioneered a brand-new path in thought. His research on the mind and nature was more profound and extensive than that of Zhou Dunyi, Cheng Yi, Zhu Xi, and Lu Jiuyuan, and the theories he elaborated on education were even more unprecedented. What is particularly commendable is that Yangming lived between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when traditional Taoist thought enveloped the entire society, yet he alone could blaze his own trail, not bound by old sayings, and put forward new views and spirits of education. Compared to Rousseau, who was born in the seventeenth century, he is even more worthy of our respect. Unfortunately, people only know his philosophy of "unity of knowledge and action" and "extending innate knowledge," and rarely understand his theory of child education.

Wang Yangming's theory of child education is explained in detail in his "Main Points for Teaching Children, Instructions to Teachers Liu Bosong and Others" (see "Instructions for Practical Living"). He said: "Now when teaching children, one should focus on filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. As for the methods of cultivating and nurturing them, it is appropriate to entice them with singing poems to express their aspirations, guide them to practice etiquette to cultivate their dignity, and encourage them to read books to open their minds. Nowadays, people often consider singing poems and practicing etiquette to be irrelevant to current affairs. This is a vulgar and narrow-minded view, insufficient to understand the intention of the ancients in establishing education!" Yangming believes that the purpose of child education is "to enlighten them with the right way" (see the same text), and the principle is "filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame," purely for moral practice. He advocates the "unity of knowledge and action" to strengthen the connection between knowledge and behavior, that is, morality is not only satisfied with "knowing" but must be expressed in actual behavior. By knowing to strengthen one's actions, and from actions to solidify one's knowledge, this is the entire learning process of combining knowledge and action. To achieve this practical goal, one must pay attention to teaching materials. Yangming proposed "singing poems," "practicing etiquette," and "reading books." "Singing poems" is "emotional education." Ancient China highly valued "poetry education," which has a great effect on stimulating will and expressing emotions. The "singing and playing" courses in elementary schools today have the same value. "Practicing etiquette" can be said to be a kind of "attitude education," enabling children to cultivate an appropriate attitude to enhance their ability to adapt to life. "Reading books" belongs to "knowledge education." Knowledge is indeed very important for daily life, but if it is separated from the training of practical life, it will inevitably be biased. Yangming's attention to children's emotions and attitudes is worth remembering.

Yangming was able to deeply understand children's psychology. He went on to say: "Generally speaking, children's nature is to enjoy playing and dislike restraint, like grass and trees that are just sprouting, they thrive when stretched out and wither when suppressed. Now, when teaching children, one must guide them to be motivated and joyful in their hearts. Like timely rain and spring breeze, when applied to grass and trees, everything sprouts and flourishes, naturally growing day by day; if there is ice and frost, then life becomes desolate and withers."

### The Third Road

— Jing Guan

For the past twenty or thirty years, we seem to have only two views and approaches to tradition and the status quo: revolution and reaction. Upholding tradition and maintaining the status quo is reaction, while overthrowing tradition and the status quo is revolution. Between revolution and reaction, there seems to be no third road. Not being revolutionary is being reactionary; this is what we often hear. But is there no third road? Britain and the United States are now trying to take this third road. American philosopher R.B. Perry, in his book "Puritanism and Democracy," proposed the so-called third road. He said: "Puritanism and democracy, under these or other names, constitute the main part of the American legacy. The main source of any nation's spiritual cultivation must be its own past, constantly rediscovering and renewing the past. A nation that denies its tradition loses its historical identity and destroys the main source of its spiritual vitality. However, a nation that first reaffirms its tradition can also become stagnant and corrupt. But we do not have to choose between revolution and reaction. We have three roads. This third road is faithful with discrimination and foresight." In other words, Perry's so-called third road is to discriminate against tradition, distinguishing its good or bad elements, as a standard for clearing away or retaining. For tradition, it needs to be modified, but it does not need to be completely overthrown. We cannot be overly new, nor can we be overly old. Any nation must have historical traditions, but any nation must also modify its traditions. Moving forward is moving forward on the basis of tradition, not moving forward away from tradition. The author believes that this is of great value to pay attention to.

### Academic Forest Talks (26)

— Zhang Qiyun

Preface to the New Chronicles of Zunyi

The Institute of History and Geography of National Zhejiang University was established in August of the 28th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the school site was in Yishan, Guangxi. Then Guinan sued, and Suiyu returned to Yiyi in the north. After that, the environment was relatively stable, and the research work made orderly progress. The institute is divided into four groups according to the nature of the discipline, the History Group, the Geomorphology Group, the Meteorology Group, and the Human Geography Group. Recruit graduate students every year. In the 35th autumn, the university began to move back to Hangzhou, leaving Zunyi for seven years. During this period, the tutors and graduate students of the research institute devoted themselves to the field investigation of the Yiyi, and made detailed research on geology, topography, climate, soil, population, settlement, land use, industry, transportation, ethnicity, historical sites and other items. Recording is gratifying, now it is compiled into a book, named "Yi New Chronicles", a total of eleven chapters, seventeen million words, attached with twenty-two maps. Professor Ye Liangfu guided the research and axe-corrected the manuscript, and used a lot of force. Mr. Chen Shupeng's research on the relative height of Zunyi is still the first work in my country. The soil chapter was written by Mr. Ma Rongzhi of the Central Geological Survey in the summer of the 35th year, I would like to express my gratitude. Professor Tan Qixiang's Kao of Yang Bao of Bozhou elaborates on the origins of the Yang Bao clan and the beginning and end of the founding of the country during the 830 years from the late Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, and the old certificate is precise, which is an important document. This is not reproduced here. In addition, there are 40 other papers, which are stored in the institute. Due to space limitations, they have not been published one by one. Now the catalogue is attached at the end of this book.

The Zunyi Prefecture Chronicle was completed in the 21st year of Daoguang, and was compiled by Zheng Zhen and Mo Youzhi. It has 48 volumes, which is known as refined and thorough. Yang Enuan and Zhao Kai compiled the township events from the 22nd year of Daoguang to the 3rd year of Xuantong as the continuation of the Zunyi Prefecture Chronicle, which was completed in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Yiyi has this book of inquiry and preparation, which is enough to add color to the local area. The past chronicles of Shun China are intended to preserve the documents of Sangzi, so their records focus on local historical materials. Most of the new chronicles of Zunyi compiled by the Institute this time are geographical works, with special emphasis on the expression of maps. They are different from the old chronicles in style and are sufficient to fill in the gaps. The most important thing is to improve the people's livelihood. For example, the land use chapter uses the one-fifty-thousandth topographic map published by the Land Survey Bureau in the 29th year of the Republic of China as a powder book. According to the actual survey data, all the distribution of arable land, forests, wasteland, roads, and houses is filled in on the hill, explained, and suggestions are made. This investigation was led by Professor Ren Mei'e, and Chen Shupeng, Zhao Songqiao, Shi Yafeng, and Yang Lipu jointly served as its affairs. From September 24th to October 27th of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the period was one month, and the cost was 8,000 yuan. At that time, the institute's funding was only enough for daily applications, and the ideological and times society gave financial assistance with the surplus funds, which made it possible to complete this project. The drawing of this kind of land use map is still the first time in my country. If it can be widely promoted in various places, it will benefit the great cause of national construction, which is not shallow. The conclusions about the agricultural improvement of Zunyi in the article are based on the field experience, and the facts are not. Not only can it be used as a guideline for the establishment and killing of the local government in the future, but also draw a cross-sectional picture for our vast rural areas, and I hope that those who speak for agricultural policy in my country will pay attention to it. Professor Liu Zhiyuan discovered the Tuanxi Creek Mine in the 30th year of the Republic of China. The manganese of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant during the war was supplied nearby, which is of great significance to the industrial construction in the southwest in the future and is also a memorable event. (The price of each book is 500,000 yuan. Buyers please write directly to the Institute of History and Geography of National Zhejiang University)

### "The Spirit of Fahai"

— Sun He

Yesterday, the child came back from watching the "Legend of the White Snake" and asked me, "Why did the monk Fahai have to suppress the White Snake Lady in the tower?"

The child is only in school, and he does not understand the sacredness and greatness of love, but he knows that everything about the White Snake Lady has been personified. Since she has no malice towards Xu Xian, the monk really has no need to oppress her or separate them.

Yes! Why oppress her?

As a monk, if he is a high monk, he should protect all living beings, "equalize enemies and relatives", why bother with meddling, and insist on breaking up a good family, making the White Snake Lady hate her for life?

The creation of this tragedy, today, we can use Freud's psychoanalysis to explain, the motive is a conscious or unconscious jealousy.

However, in the human world, there are many people who specialize in parasitizing on alienation and destruction. They are afraid that other people's families will be harmonious, happy, and consistent, so they specialize in creating rumors and rumors to deceive the parties concerned. For this kind of person, we should not hesitate to give the greatest hatred, expose their base psychology of eating friction meals, and then things in the world will have a solution.

Jinshan Temple was burned down. Unfortunately, what should have been burned down was not Jinshan Temple, but the spirit of Fahai!

### How to Collect Photographs and Autographs of World Celebrities

— Cang Yu

In front of a house in Brooklyn, USA, sits a weathered mailbox that constantly receives the most amazing letters from around the world. Through the slot of that mailbox are delivered letters from kings, queens, presidents, bishops, dictators, generals, Nobel Prize winners, as well as celebrities like Gandhi, Churchill, Sinclair, Lindbergh, and Einstein.

Behind this mailbox sits the world's most famous "autograph" collector - Greenaway. He is not satisfied with just a signature, but also requires a photograph that the signatory considers to be their best. As a result, he has collected six thousand photographs and autographs of "history makers."

World celebrities rarely agree to the requests of an autograph collector, let alone attach an autographed photo, but when Greenaway makes a request, they rarely disappoint him.

He discovered that most celebrities have a vulnerable spot that is easy to attack - their hobbies. So, when he learned that Prime Minister Attlee liked woodworking, General Zhukov collected medals, Churchill liked copper drums, and Emperor Showa liked using microscopes, he had a way to proceed. He found out that the famous writer H.G. Wells collected toy soldiers, so he sent him a set of rare toy soldiers - and Wells, in gratitude, immediately sent him an autographed photo.

The Duchess of Windsor ignored his first ten letters, but when he sent her a scrapbook filled with news praising her marriage, his request was granted.

Greenaway wrote to the automobile magnate Ford and the inventor Edison for eleven years before finally getting his wish. When he pointed out to Einstein's secretary that he had written three hundred letters to the scientist requesting an autographed photo, the secretary replied that if Greenaway could donate ten US dollars to the children's milk fund, the photo could be sent. He donated ten dollars, and Einstein's autographed photo arrived.

The greatest feature of the photographs collected by Greenaway is that they reveal the personality and hobbies of each individual. For example, the photo Roosevelt sent him was of Roosevelt and his wife chatting by the fireside. The photo Trotsky sent him was a swimming photo, with the words "Wishing you good health, from Trotsky." Mussolini's was a mountain climbing photo, with the words: "1929 is the year of God, and also the seventh year of the Mussolini century." When Greenaway wrote to Hitler for a photo in 1933, Hitler sent him a photo twice as big as Mussolini's.

Greenaway said, "Never ask someone for a photo when they become headline news. It is best to write a few months later, when they will be happy to accept your request because they see that people have forgotten them and you still remember them. In addition, today's opposition leader may be tomorrow's prime minister, today's senator may be tomorrow's president, so it is a good idea to prepare for the future. Asking for an autographed photo on a celebrity's birthday is unlikely to disappoint you."

Greenaway began collecting autographed photos in 1921. Now, his bank safe contains six thousand photos, including representatives from every nation that signed the Treaty of Versailles, representatives from every nation that accepted Japan's unconditional surrender, the pilots who bombed Japan with the atomic bomb, every Nazi war criminal from Nuremberg, and the last five US presidents.

Only two world celebrities have stumped him, one is the violinist Kreisler, and the other is Marshal Stalin. But he is not discouraged. He said that when he collects the autographed photos of these two people, he will feel that everything is perfect.

### Inscription on Zheng Yimei's "Anecdotes of Recent Times"

— Chen Meng'an

One

For a long time, hidden hermits have been sought,
Corals have been gathered in one net.
This is a timeless matter of famous mountains,
May you cherish the "Lu Chunqiu."

Two

Each word carries the frost and snow of strict judgment,
The worthy and the villain are classified separately.
Like Ru Nan's monthly critiques and Longmen's pen,
You alone combine the glory of both Yang and Yuan.

Three

Zhang and Cai each had their own skill with the brush,
Yuan and Xun set the rules for generations.
Searching for forgotten things can be a lesson for today,
Recording events can be a teacher for the ages.
The "White Tiger Sutra" offers its theories,
The "Gongyang Commentary" presents its different interpretations.
Keep this book by your side,
And forever use it as a model.

Four

What harm is there in casually discussing the "court gazette"?
And unverified rumor is not to be trusted.
Who can continue the wild history of neglected pavilions?
A straight pen elucidates the obscure and reveals the subtle.

Five

Who knows which figures are still vigorous?
As I grow old, my feelings become unbearable.
Don't say that studying books is just wasting paper,
The "A New Account of the World" still maintains a refined discussion.

### Fish of My Hometown

— Chen Yi Xian

"I'd rather drink the water of Jianye than eat the fish of Wuchang." (A saying from the Three Kingdoms period) The fish of my Chu region have been famous throughout the world for thousands of years. From Huangzhou to Huangshigang, a hundred-li stretch of water, the fish produced are the most numerous and the most delicious. When Su Dongpo first arrived in Huangzhou, he wrote a poem, "The Yangtze River surrounds the city, knowing the fish are delicious; the good bamboo connects to the mountains, feeling the bamboo shoots are fragrant." The "Chibi Rhapsody" has the line "Raise the net and get fish, huge mouths and fine scales, shaped like the perch of Songjiang." Zhang Zhihe's poem "White egrets fly before Xisai Mountain, peach blossoms flow and mandarin fish are fat." (Xisai Mountain is near Huangshigang, also named Daoshang .) These famous lines are enough to add color to the fish of my hometown.

My ancestral home is the Ba River in Qishui County. The Ba River borders the Yangtze, and is located right in the middle of Huangzhou and Huangshigang. In the past, when I returned to my hometown to sweep the tombs, the people of my clan would invite me to dinner, and fish was a necessary dish, either stir-fried fish slices or fish balls (i.e. fish dumplings). The fish slices are made with mandarin fish, because they have fewer bones; the fish balls are made with white fish, which is fresh and tender. White fish are produced in all lakes and rivers, and the large ones can grow to four or five feet long, and are also called Yang . The "Garden of Stories" has the saying "Those who cast their lines with the wrong bait and are welcomed to suck it are Yang." This is the first of my nostalgic hometown flavors.

Across the river from Huangzhou is Xishan Mountain, which contains the Hanxi Temple. When Dongpo was exiled to Huangzhou, he often traveled there by boat. Below Xishan Mountain is Fankou, which is the mouth where the inner lake communicates with the outer river, much like the mouth of the lake that welcomes Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River. The fish produced in the waters where Fankou connects the lake and the river are the best bream, with small heads and wide bellies, called Chatou bream, also known as Zhejia bream. Although the villagers are not good at cooking, the bream is deep-fried in oil and then seasoned with pine branches, which is the most fragrant with wine. The sides of this fish are the most fatty and delicious. The "Book of Songs" says, "How can it be that when eating fish, it must be the carp of the river?" is carp, this is the second of my nostalgic hometown flavors.

Although Yunmeng County in Hubei does not border the river, it has many lakes. The local people use the white fish from the lake, mixed with bean flour, to make fish noodles, which are good both stir-fried and boiled, and even more delicious when stir-fried with crabs. Chen San Yuan wrote a poem, "My left foot wildly discards the sandal, and I'm not willing to eat with others. The home-brewed wine is planted by Tao Gong, and the hometown flavor is allowed to be Xu Po's noodles." There is a small note: "Jiusheng set up Yunmeng fish noodles, and Zuo Sou called it the creation of Shangshu Zhao Chun's mother in the Qianlong period, so it is called Xu Po's noodles." This is a special product of Hubei, the third of my nostalgic hometown flavors.

Before the Republic, when my family lived in Wuchang, we always made preserved fish at the end of the year. Relatives and friends would buy large green fish or carp, from dozens of catties to two or three hundred catties, salt them for a few days and dry them in the sun. They were used to worship gods and ancestors and to entertain guests as New Year's dishes. Those that were not eaten were cut into pieces and soaked in camellia oil. In the summer, they were taken out and steamed, and they tasted like ham, clean and without drawbacks, better than the dried green fish from Hangzhou and Shaoxing. When making preserved fish for the New Year, the roe and liver and white from the belly of the green fish were stir-fried with shredded radish, and everyone could eat as much as they wanted. This is the fourth of my nostalgic hometown flavors.

The Wuchang area has bream, white in color, with a fleshy back, without scales, and the long ones can reach two or three feet. It is best to braise it in soy sauce. The Wumingyuan restaurant in Hankou is most famous for making this. There is also catfish, with a large head and a flat tail, without scales, and a curved and wide mouth, and the large ones can reach more than two feet long. It is steamed with ham, flat bamboo shoots, fragrant mushrooms and oil nets, and has a clear and rich taste. This is the fifth of my nostalgic hometown flavors.

Shanghai has Cantonese cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, Fujian cuisine, Shandong and Beiping cuisine, Ningbo cuisine, Suzhou restaurants, and Anhui restaurants, and even Jiu Ru Restaurant and Dewei's Hunan cuisine, but no Hubei cuisine. Friends often discuss this with each other. In fact, there is a special flavor in my hometown, that is, steamed dishes from Mianyang and Tianmen. Chicken, duck, fish, and meat can all be steamed with rice flour. When my relative, Zhou Shenguan, invited guests, one of the dishes was powdered steamed . Its taste is no less than the small cage powdered steamed beef in Jinjiang and other Sichuan restaurants. This is the sixth of my nostalgic hometown flavors.

Since the July 7th Incident, the War of Resistance was followed by banditry, and I have still not been able to return to my hometown to sweep the tombs. I have not tasted the flavors of my hometown for twelve years. I am writing this article to quench my thirst by looking at plums and to fill my hunger with shark cakes.

### The Child Prodigy of Taiwan, Zeng

— Dongfang Jibai

In the past, Licheng, Shandong, produced a child prodigy named Jiang Xizhang, who annotated the Four Books at the age of nine, causing a sensation for a time. But the later he got, the worse he became, and he eventually became silent and unknown.

Now, Henan has also produced a child prodigy, Zeng Woshi, who has long been a household name in Taiwan, and everyone praises him.

This child prodigy is only five years old this year, and everyone calls him "Five-Year-Old Child Prodigy." He is good at calligraphy and painting, and can wield a brush in public without any difficulty. Last month, on the 20th, the Welfare Association of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation invited Zeng Woshi to perform calligraphy and painting in Huwei, and men, women, and children came to see him in droves. The child prodigy was dressed in shorts, blue socks, and yellow shoes, with a lively and natural demeanor, and seemed to be oblivious to the presence of others. The paper, brushes, ink, and inkstone were prepared in advance. The child prodigy jumped onto the table, sat on the paper, and began to wield his brush, writing the character "Shou" (longevity), and then the character "Hu" (tiger). Its position, stroke power, and structure were all just right, far beyond what an ordinary adult could achieve. How could that little hand have such great wrist strength? It seems that it did not come from practice. The "Hu" character was written in cursive script, and the last stroke was drawn as long as three feet, and he explained that this was "Huwei" (tiger's tail). He also made a painting of orchids for the daughter of a certain section chief in public, and the inscription read: "Orchids are the fragrance of kings," which was chic and stylish, and indeed difficult to achieve. The visitors all marveled at the cleverness of this five-year-old child, and thought it was a "miracle."

Wherever Zeng Woshi goes, his father always follows him to take care of everything. A considerable price must be paid for asking him to do calligraphy and painting. His family's economic situation is said to be very bad, and life is very problematic, but since the child prodigy's fame has become a sensation, many people have given him money, and his life has improved greatly. The government sought to help him study further, and provided him with scholarships. If he can be cultivated properly and fully develop his unique talent, he will surely achieve something in the future. Unfortunately, his father has turned the child prodigy into a capital for making money, taking his child to perform here and there, and making a big business out of it. He charges a certain amount for each performance and another amount for taking pictures, and he has simply become a street performer. I have read in ancient texts that Zhongyong, a villager of Wang Anshi, was extremely intelligent in his childhood, but he was eventually ruined and trampled upon, and he declined and fell. It seems that Zeng Woshi, this lovely little child, is also embarking on this dim road. (Written in Taipei)

### 

Recently, it was reported that a Japanese fishing boat was fishing in Chinese territorial waters and was sunk by our warship. It also mentioned the Unzen Maru. This event is very gratifying, and all our people should breathe a sigh of relief. This sigh of relief is not just for this one thing, but because when the Japanese flame was at its peak, they roamed freely on the sea and land of China, as if there was no one else there, and were unreasonably domineering, which made our people feel oppressed, swallow their voices, and endure their anger for a long time. In recent times, in the two years before the July 7th Incident, "smuggling" occurred in various places in the north and south, and their government even called it "special trade." Whenever they were captured by customs or anti-smuggling ships, Japanese and Korean rogues would gather to rob them, so that our country's laws could not be enforced. Their consuls would do their best to protect them, in an阴阳怪气manner, and to the extreme ugly. The losses suffered by Chinese merchants and the national treasury are innumerable. When we read the newspapers, we often saw the faces of violent and rogue-like people. Only because our strength was not equal, our anger was suppressed and could not be vented, and it was not just a matter of one morning or evening. In the distant past, such as in 1908, in the Yue-Nan territorial waters, the Japanese ship Er Chen Maru carried a large amount of smuggled goods, gunpowder, etc., and drove straight into the inner port in violation of the ban. Wu Jingrong, the commander of our Baobi warship, forbade it according to maritime law, boarded the ship for inspection, and, according to the convention, escorted the ship and goods to Humen. Zhang Renjun, the governor of Guangdong, in accordance with the customs joint trial regulations, requested the Japanese consul stationed in Guangdong to conduct a joint trial, but the Japanese consul refused to pay attention, and his envoy made a big noise in the capital to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Qing court was frightened and bowed its head, and ordered the Guangdong governor to immediately release the Japanese ship, compensate for all losses, and punish Chinese officials. All that they demanded was done. This kind of evil and ugly behavior is not only "making power the truth", but also "mixing ghosts and power". Although they gained the upper hand by relying on their power, their international personality was swept away, which is suitable to warn them of being little ghosts. Our commander Wu, as a humble official of a weak country, regardless of the pros and cons, and without avoiding difficulties, executed his duties and completed his mission. Although he suffered unreasonable suppression afterwards, his intelligence and courage were extraordinary, and Chinese and Western people admired him in unison, and he could occupy a page in the glorious national history. Now, the Japanese ships that invaded our seas have been captured; the Japanese criminals have been tried; and their smuggled goods have been confiscated. In the past, even asking their consul to attend the joint trial was not condescended to, but now Chinese officials can try and judge on their own. Where is the overbearing and fierce force of the past now? The net of heaven is vast, and it misses nothing. Is it so! Someone might say that China has openly stated that it will not take a retaliatory attitude towards Japan, and has expressed "leniency". Why are you so indignant? Aren't you being narrow-minded? I say: "Leniency" and "non-retaliation" are the attitudes of the big countries of the authorities, and they have their own inevitable difficulties. In short, the foundation of morality, the relationship between the gaps, and the needs of reality are not just one end, and there is no need to criticize and analyze them here. This time, the Chinese navy's capture of smugglers and punishment of the Japanese was an enforcement of the law, and it was not a retaliation. However, "a person is a breath of air." What I have seen, heard, and recorded in my life, the arrogant and harsh oppression that the Japanese have imposed on China, and the way in which the Chinese people have been oppressed again and again and again for decades, almost suffocating, makes this capture of the boats, the arrest of the smugglers, the trial of the criminals, and the confiscation of the goods a happy thing. Expressing my feelings and making my voice heard is also a matter of not being myself.
