### President Flies to Kaifeng for Inspection,  Stops in Zhengzhou to Instruct on Military Matters

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The President will make his first inspection tour since taking office on the 21st, to inspect the war situation on the Longhai Railway line.  He will fly over Kaifeng to inspect, in order to encourage the national army who are struggling to hold the core of Bian, and to stabilize the morale of the Central Plains war zone. After presiding over the Central Political Committee meeting on the morning of the 21st, the President took off from Dajiaochang at 1:30 p.m. in a special four-engine plane. He landed in Xuzhou en route, and then flew over Shangqiu and Kaifeng. He spoke to the local commanders in the air, inquired about the battle situation, and gave instructions to the officers. Then he flew to Zhengzhou to land. The President is scheduled to stay in Zhengzhou for one night to instruct on military matters, and then fly to Xi'an on the 22nd for inspection before returning to Nanjing.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 21st] The soldiers and civilians in Kaifeng City were greatly inspired after hearing the news that the President was inspecting Kaifeng from the air, and they are willing to make their greatest efforts to defend this ancient city of the Central Plains.

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Minister of National Defense He Yingqin reported on the Kaifeng battle situation at the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang on the morning of the 21st. He believes that the fortifications in the northwest of Kaifeng are extremely solid, and there will be no problem in holding it for three to five days. If the battle of Kaifeng can last for three to five days, the situation can be turned from danger to safety. The army from western Henan has already begun to reinforce on the 20th, and the reinforcements from western Shandong are also about to depart. He stated: The battle of Kaifeng will not be too serious. He said: The reason why the bandit army attacked Bian is because the focus of the current war is in western Shandong, and the bandits took advantage of the fact that our main force was in western Shandong and entered the city by surprise. The battle of western Shandong will come to an end within a few days, and the siege of Kaifeng can be lifted.

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Representatives from Henan, legislators, supervisors, and people from Henan in Nanjing went to the Presidential Palace at 11:00 a.m. on the 21st to petition. Because the President was presiding over the Central Political Committee meeting at the Central Party Headquarters, they were received by Chief of Staff Xue Yue. Xue said: You are requesting the President to go to the front line to personally supervise the battle. The President has decided to go to the front to inspect. Regarding the reinforcements, the reinforcements from all directions have arrived near the suburbs, and a large army has been airlifted from Hankou to Zhengzhou, which can join forces with the defending army in Kaifeng. The petitioners left the Presidential Palace at 12:00 p.m.

### The National Army in the Besieged City of Bian Firmly Defends the Core, Reinforcements from the East and West are Rushing Forward, Strong Air Force Shuttles Day and Night to Assist in the Battle

[Our Xuzhou Office, 21st] Liu Zhi, Commander-in-Chief of the East China Bandit Suppression, flew over Kaifeng again at 10:00 a.m. on the 21st from Zhengzhou, and flew back to Xuzhou at noon. Liu looked down at Kaifeng from the air. The defending troops in the city are still holding important strongholds such as Henan University, Iron Pagoda, Catholic Church, Local Court, and Longting, and are fighting fiercely with the bandits. The western reinforcements have crossed Zhongmu, and the eastern reinforcements have also advanced to Lanfeng.

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] According to a urgent telegram from the military press in Kaifeng at 11:00 a.m. on the 21st: As of the afternoon of the 20th, the bandits who invaded Kaifeng City were attacked by the National Army from the land and air, suffering heavy casualties. A part of the bandits gathering in the suburbs of the city has fled elsewhere, and are engaged in battle with the reinforcing troops of the National Army, so the momentum of the attack on the city has greatly weakened. In addition to firmly defending the three major strongholds of the Provincial Government (city center), Henan University (northeast of the city), and the artillery positions in the northwest corner, other strongholds such as Longting (northwest of the city), Drum Tower, Catholic Church, and Court (near the Provincial Government) are also firmly defended by the National Army. The fires set by the bandits have been extinguished by the team in cooperation with the residents. A small number of remnant bandits have already begun to flee outside the city this morning. At the moment, the reinforcements from all directions are rushing forward, and the vanguard is only 30 li away from Kaifeng, and they are fighting fiercely with the bandits who are trying to prevent the reinforcements from advancing. It is expected that they will join forces with the defending troops in the city today or tomorrow.

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] According to a telegram from the military press in Zhengzhou on the 21st: The situation in Kaifeng has eased today. The core positions in the city are all firmly held by the National Army. The reinforcements are rushing towards Bian from the east and west gates. The bandits are trying to obstruct them, and their forces are greatly dispersed. The National Army's eastern advancing army has crossed Zhongmu. A part of the Chen bandit's 3rd and 8th columns, more than 5,000 people, were defeated. In addition to sending a part of the army to rush to Kaifeng, the National Army is fiercely suppressing a division of the Chen bandit's 9th column in the area west of Baisha. The westward advancing army has also reached the outskirts of Kaifeng. Large formations of the air force are taking turns bombing, especially causing heavy casualties to the bandits. Under the fierce attacks from the land and air, the bandit's offensive has been frustrated.

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] It is reported that the air force is fully assisting the defending troops in Kaifeng to hold the core positions, and is dispatching bombers from the three bases of Hankou, Xuzhou, and Zhengzhou. On one hand, it is preventing the bandit army from attacking Bian, and on the other hand, it is intercepting the bandit's reinforcements from southwestern Shandong and north of the Yellow River, with great effect. According to the air force's inspection over Kaifeng, the defending troops are firmly holding the two positions in the northwest and north of the city as the core. In other areas, they are engaged in fierce street battles with the bandits. The bandit's artillery positions and anti-aircraft artillery positions have been destroyed by the air force.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 21st] The air force's Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Bohai Sea units' fleet of planes are shuttling day and night to fly over Bian to assist in the battle, and to suppress the bandit's offensive, forcing the bandit army to be unable to approach the core strongholds such as the northwest and west corners of the city, which are firmly held by the defending troops in the city. The bandits who rushed in from the west gate were almost completely wiped out by the air force's fierce bombing today. The bandit artillery positions in the west and south of the city, and the bandit anti-aircraft artillery positions in the southwest corner of the west gate, have been destroyed.

[Another Telegram] The bandits who fled from southwestern Shandong were intercepted by the National Army in Caoxian yesterday, suffering heavy casualties. At present, parts of the Chen bandit's 3rd and 8th columns have fled west to join the bandits attacking Bian. Another part of the bandits has fled south across the Longhai Railway. Also, a part of the Liu bandit in western Henan fled east across the Pinghan Railway from near Suiping on the 20th.

### Fierce and Bloody Battle on the Pinggu Line, Struggle for Gubeikou Reaches Decisive Stage, Military Vehicles in the City of Beijing Rush to Support

[Our Beiping Office, 21st] The battle on the Pinggu Line is proceeding fiercely, and the battle for Gubeikou has reached a decisive stage. On the 21st, the bandits launched a general offensive, and the defending troops, supported by the air force, are making a final resistance. It is reported that after the remnants of the bandit's 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns occupied the small stronghold outside Huixian Pavilion, they猛扑Gubeikou. The defending troops retreated to the core positions. The situation gradually reversed from dusk on the 20th to dawn on the 21st, and became more serious in the afternoon. The National Army on the Pinggu Road has rushed north to support. The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced that the bandits suffered more than 2,000 casualties in this offensive. Also, Shixia (south of Gubeikou) was abandoned at 0:00 a.m. on the 20th, which has been confirmed by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. The National Army at Xiaoying Station, south of Shixia, has also withdrawn.

[Our Beiping Office, 21st] There is unrest in northern Ping. Bandits were found disturbing Tangshan, Jiuli Mountain, and Jinshan in Changping on the 20th. After the National Army fought back, the bandits fled north to Jiuli Mountain, and the National Army continued to pursue and suppress them. Military vehicles in the city of Beijing rushed to the Pinggu Line and northern Ping on the 21st.

[Our Qinhuangdao Office, 21st] Wheat is ripening in eastern Hebei. The bandits are using field army units to protect local armed forces, and are disturbing everywhere, causing the National Army and security teams to be deadlocked. The bandits are able to seize large areas and harvest crops, and this flexible policy makes it difficult for the National Army to cope. A strong force has been sent from Zaoqiang County to protect farmers and harvesting work. The local government and people are earnestly hoping that more of this force will be sent to various places, and that action will be taken without delay, in order to harvest a good crop.

### The Fighting Around Jinan has Subsided

No Bandits Within Ten Li of Yanzhou

[Our Jinan Office, 21st] The fighting around Jinan has subsided. On the 21st, the eastern line of the National Army and the bandits were in a stalemate in the Daliujiazhuang area south of Gangshan. Wang Yaowu went to inspect the Gongzhong area outside the city of Jinan on the 21st. He expressed satisfaction with the tens of thousands of most solid fortress works in this area. At the same time, after inspecting the troops, he also praised the spirit of the officers and soldiers, and believed that with these fortifications and troops, the city of Jinan could be absolutely guaranteed. In addition to the original northwest airport in the commercial port, in order to strengthen external connections, it was decided to build another airport on the open space east of Qilu University, which will be started soon.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 21st] The National Army in Yanzhou has been sweeping the outer areas for several days. There are no traces of bandits within ten li of the four suburbs of Yanzhou.

### The National Army Pursues and Suppresses in Qile, Destroying Bandit Military Facilities

Commander Li Mo'an telegraphed the defending troops to take advantage of the victory and pursue and suppress the bandits in Limin and Haifu Towns, killing many bandits, and destroying the bandit arsenal, warehouses, and all military facilities.

[Another Telegram] A certain unit of the National Army has now stationed in Shigang, and continues to sweep around Tangjiayuan, destroying the nest of the Tongru Detachment of the bandits, and capturing and killing more than 50 bandit cadres.

### The Sixth Meeting of the Supervisory Yuan Passes the Method for Exercising the Power of Consent, Discussion of Draft Organization Law of Various Committees Not Completed

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The Supervisory Yuan will hold the Military Case Review Committee of the Supervisory Committee's Office Organization Regulations on the morning of the 22nd, and will hold the seventh meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 22nd to continue discussing the draft organization law of various committees and the office organization regulations.

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The Supervisory Yuan's method for exercising the power of consent was discussed and passed at the sixth meeting held by the Supervisory Yuan at 3:30 p.m. on the 21st, without making a single word of revision. During the discussion, regarding the provision that the plenary review meeting of the Supervisory Yuan should be held secretly before the power of consent is exercised, Committee Member Hao Yulin expressed his opinion, believing that except for national defense and foreign affairs, which should be kept secret, the exercise of the power of consent should not be kept secret, and the personnel attending the review committee are all committee members. It is impossible to keep them from leaking after the meeting. If it is said that they are afraid of offending people, it seems that there is no need to worry too much. As for the issue of publishing by news reporters, the reporters can be notified in advance. Hao's speech was the only one in the Supervisory Yuan who spoke for reporters, but in the end he was unable to do anything alone and was not modified. After the draft of the method for exercising the power of consent was passed, the draft organization law of each committee was discussed. The draft had been revised and passed in the review meeting held on the morning of the 21st, but during the discussion in the general meeting, the number and category of committees to be established caused a heated debate. According to the original draft, twelve committees were to be established, including internal affairs, foreign affairs, military affairs, finance, economics, education, transportation, justice, society (agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy), and land administration (border administration and overseas Chinese affairs). The revision in the review meeting changed the military affairs committee to the national defense committee, and the border administration and overseas Chinese affairs were divided into two committees, and a grain committee was established, for a total of fourteen committees. Some people also advocated adding a special committee to supervise the use of US aid and the collection of special relief donations. After discussion, it was considered unnecessary to specify the categories, because the original draft already had the provision that "the Supervisory Yuan may add other committees when necessary," which can be included. Then, several people spoke, all believing that there were too many committees, which was unrealistic. The discussion lasted for two hours without completion. The chairman announced that the discussion would continue at the next meeting, and the meeting came to an end. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Yu Youren, with 133 committee members present, and adjourned at 6:30 p.m.

According to Jiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party is willing to consider the difficulties of the authorities regarding the number of legislators, and reduce the originally insisted 30 to 25.

### Bai Chongxi Banquets Legislative and Supervisory Committee Members of Central China Region, Explains the Essentials of Total War, the Task of Suppressing Bandits Can Only be Accomplished Through Military-Civilian Cooperation

[Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Bandit Suppression, hosted a banquet for Legislative and Supervisory Committee members of various provinces in the Central China region at the Overseas Chinese Hotel at 7:00 p.m. on the 21st to exchange views on bandit suppression in Central China. More than a hundred people attended, including Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, Liu Wendao, Fan Yusui, and Guo Zhongkui. During the banquet, Bai stood up to speak, first explaining the scope of the Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, including the five provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and the city of Hankou. Then he explained the importance of the total war in Central China, and the essentials of the total war plan, emphasizing the necessity of military, political, economic, and cultural coordination. He pointed out that the task of suppressing bandits can only be accomplished through military-civilian cooperation, but the prerequisite for military-civilian cooperation is good military discipline.

Editorial

### The Beginning of the American Political Season

The Second Session of the 80th United States Congress opened on January 7th of this year and has calmly discussed the serious problems facing the United States. It was not until late on the 19th of this month that the peacetime conscription law and the foreign aid law were completed, and the session adjourned early on the 20th. Unless there are urgent events at home and abroad in the future, President Truman will not convene temporary meetings of the Senate and House of Representatives. Therefore, Congress will not convene the Third Session until December 31st. According to normal practice, the congressional recess is a "quiet month" in American politics. However, this year is the US presidential election year. Which party will ultimately own the White House? This will be revealed in the general election in November this year, and the competition between the Democratic and Republican parties has become increasingly fierce in recent days. President Truman has been traveling around the country since the 2nd of this month, giving campaign speeches. The Republican National Convention opened in Philadelphia yesterday. Will the party's presidential candidate ultimately be Stassen? Dewey? Martin? Taft? Or Vandenberg? This will be revealed in a day or two. At the same time, the Democratic National Convention will also open in Philadelphia to determine the party's presidential candidate. Therefore, this year's "quiet political month" after the US congressional recess has turned into the American "political season."

The United States is a truly democratic country. Although political parties engage in elections using unscrupulous means, with a wide variety of bizarre and outlandish phenomena, they all maintain a free and democratic style. In particular, the Democratic and Republican parties attach great importance to this year's general election, and the competition is particularly fierce. Since yesterday, the American election can be said to have officially begun, like a grand opera on stage. Not only are the gongs and drums of both sides played particularly loudly, but also the number of people appearing on stage from both sides is particularly large. We abandon all preconceptions and look at the progress of the American election with the mentality of an outsider, and we already feel that it is full of meaning.

Since the late President Roosevelt entered the White House in 1933 and implemented the New Deal, the Democratic Party has controlled the US government for nearly sixteen years. Roosevelt's contributions to the United States and even the world are indelible in the hearts of the American people. He not only saved the US economic crisis, but also eliminated the threats to the American way of life. These sixteen years can be said to be the golden age of the Democratic Party. Although Roosevelt unfortunately passed away and did not live to see the end of the victory of the war, Vice President Truman succeeded him, adhering to Roosevelt's wishes and implementing the Democratic Party's established national policies, and was also able to meet the expectations of the people at home and abroad. In terms of human nature, Truman's running for president was originally not a problem; however, the domestic and international situation after the war could not be satisfactory in every respect. The urgency of the world crisis, on the one hand, increased the responsibility of the United States to the world; on the other hand, it also deepened the internal crisis of the United States, resulting in the American people's weariness and disappointment with the Democratic Party. The results of last year's re-election of senators and representatives made the 80th Congress completely under the control of the Republican Party. This fact pointed out that the direction of American public opinion has changed from weariness and disappointment to a "desire for change" in people's hearts. Therefore, most political commentators predict that the victory in this year's general election will undoubtedly belong to the Republican Party. However, the Republican Party has a wealth of talent, and there are five or six presidential candidates who are expected by the country and abroad. Moreover, these figures have their own strengths, and it is quite difficult to choose one at a time. The task of this Republican National Convention is to choose one among these great figures. Therefore, we cannot ignore this Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia. The presidential candidate it decides may be the future owner of the White House, succeeding President Truman and taking control of the US government.

However, as we look forward to the future of the US general election, who will win? Of course, we cannot say for sure at the moment; however, the Republican Party's victory is within reach. However, we must not have excessive expectations for the change of the White House owner, because since the congressional re-election last year, the policies promoted by President Truman, whether domestic or foreign, have been common policies of the Democratic and Republican parties. Moreover, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have no major differences in essence. Generally, constitutional scholars criticize the two major parties in the United States, saying that the Democratic and Republican parties are like two bottles of wine with different labels. On the surface, they are two kinds of wine with completely different natures, but according to the bottles, they are all empty. Therefore, no matter which party the president belongs to, we cannot hope that he will have major reforms. Especially in the relationship with the Soviet Union, Truman has expressed to the Soviet Union that the US policy toward the Soviet Union will not change regardless of the outcome of this year's general election. However, the internal and external problems of the United States today are becoming increasingly serious. Everyone knows that the United States is a capitalist country, and it is ultimately inevitable that an economic panic will occur after the war; moreover, at present, inflation and shrinking production have gradually become obvious. This is the hidden worry within the United States, and it is also a crisis that American politicians urgently need to save. If the shadow of the post-war global depression is also cast on the United States one day, then the United States will not be able to take care of itself, and it will not be able to take care of its responsibilities to the world. However, looking at the world today, the crisis is becoming more and more urgent. Ambassador Smith's attempt at peace has failed. The United States can only step up the implementation of the Truman Doctrine. The recent signing of the West German agreement and the implementation of currency reform in West Germany are enough to prove that the United States' diplomacy toward the Soviet Union will only go its own way to the end; however, the result of implementing this policy will only deepen the rift between the two worlds. Not only is it harmful to the creation of world peace, but it also makes the world crisis more urgent. In today's world where people across the country yearn for peace, they cannot help but have doubts about the government's foreign policy. Therefore, President Truman's anti-communism and Secretary of State Marshall's European aid plan will all encounter a test in this general election, so that the party that wins the election will know to be vigilant.

In addition, there is one more point that we want to emphasize, that is, the US Third Party, due to Wallace's participation in the election, has been organized in 26 states in the United States. Although Wallace's election has no hope of winning, his call to Americans with the slogans of freedom, peace, progress, and democracy is indeed easy to resonate with some Americans. Therefore, the rise and development of the Third Party in the United States is also something that we cannot ignore.

### Looking at Tokyo Amidst the Anti-Support Japan Sentiment: US Policy Aims to Prevent the Expansion of Far East Communism. Japan Will Not Be Able to Pose a Threat Within Half a Century.

[Report by Our Newspaper] Wu Jiatang, Director of the Editorial Department of this newspaper, was invited by MacArthur's Headquarters to inspect the general situation of occupied Japan. He flew to Tokyo last Wednesday and returned to Shanghai yesterday. While in Tokyo, Wu met with Commander Shang Zhen and other responsible persons of the Resident Mission in Japan, and had in-depth talks with members of the British Mission and people from all walks of life in Japan on the Japanese issue. MacArthur met with Wu last Saturday for a 45-minute conversation. During the conversation, MacArthur inquired in detail about the Chinese situation. His understanding of the situation in our country was particularly impressive, and his concern for China was by no means as indifferent as some people in the country imagined.

From MacArthur's conversation, it can be seen that he has a deep understanding of our country's strategy for suppressing the rebellion. He deeply felt that to defeat the main force of the Communist army, the current old-fashioned fixed positional warfare strategy would not be successful. Only by adopting a very new and fluid strategy, such as the one he used in the Pacific island-hopping war, could victory be achieved. MacArthur has always insisted that in the struggle to prevent totalitarianism, China is an extremely important stronghold, and its importance is no less than that of Europe. In MacArthur's eyes, the success or failure of the Pacific anti-totalitarian camp hinges on China. In the past, MacArthur's letter to US Congressman Eaton emphasized the importance of US aid to China, and this was his starting point. And MacArthur played a powerful role in the US Congress's passage of the Aid to China Act. According to Wu's observation, MacArthur has really one, two, or three identities: one is MacArthur, the US presidential candidate, the second is MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and the third is MacArthur, the leader of the Pacific anti-totalitarian collective camp. Whether the world's criticism of MacArthur is good or bad depends on the critic's own point of view.

I believe that today's Japanese issue is not a question of supporting Japan to re-emerge as a threat to the Far East, but a question of whether Japan's communist forces can make an invisible but substantial expansion in the near future. Personnel from the Chinese and British missions all believe that Japan's industry will not be able to recover to its pre-war level within 20 years. The main reason is that Japan has lost all sources of raw materials outside the three islands. At the same time, due to the widespread and deepening of democratic ideas, workers' wages have increased, and the cost of Japanese industrial products has exceeded that of our country and is close to that of Britain and the United States. Today, the price of dyed and woven silk products in Tokyo is far higher than that in Shanghai. A set of kimonos costs as much as 14 US dollars. The plan to go to Japan to buy cheap goods has all become a vain hope.

Japan has even less hope of reviving militarily. All military equipment has been dismantled and destroyed by the Allied Headquarters. At least within half a century, it cannot pose a military threat. The Allied Headquarters has no trust in the Japanese. Japan today has 125,000 policemen, and an average of five people only have one old-fashioned pistol. This is definitely not because the Allied Headquarters lacks weapons, but purely a policy issue. Moreover, today's war is a modern war, and weapons need jet planes and atomic bombs. In the process of China having a voice and the United States being responsible for supervision, Japan has no possibility of turning over. Both China and the United States have been deeply affected by Japan in the war. MacArthur, knowing China's anti-Japanese psychology and experiencing the cruel killings of the Japanese in actual combat, has stated that he will never allow Japanese militarism to revive. In fact, the Japanese also understand this point. Some Japanese also believe that the only possibility of turning over is to become communist. In Japan's international relations, the only country that has not been harmed by it is the Soviet Union, and the Japanese have the least anti-Soviet sentiment. Under the current situation, this point is worth noting. The number of Japanese Communist Party members is said to be 60,000 to 70,000, but its actual strength has exceeded one million, especially the strength of the Japanese Communist Party in the north is increasing day by day. We must know that the Japanese Communist Party is in contact with the Korean Communist Party, and the Korean Communist Party is also colluding with the Chinese Communist Party, echoing each other and forming a line. This real threat cannot be compared with abstract crises such as the restoration of Japanese industry. All policies of the Allied Headquarters target this major threat. Reforming Japan's land policy, raising the living standards of Japanese workers, strengthening food relief, and maintaining Japan's economy so that it does not collapse are not motivated by supporting Japan to become a great power in East Asia, but by preventing the expansion of totalitarian forces in the Far East. At present, the Communist Party's propaganda policy is, on the one hand, instigating the opposition in the United States to attack the Chinese government, so that the US government loses trust in the National Government. At the same time, in China, it uses another group of people to attack the US's policy of supporting Japan, so that the Chinese people develop resentment towards the United States. If this divisive tactic is successful, the entire Pacific anti-totalitarian camp can be destroyed.

The above is my observation after visiting Japan. However, when talking about the Japanese issue today, everyone has different opinions, depending entirely on each person's intentions and perspectives.

### Owner of Pinghu Restaurant Carries White Lantern

[Report from Our Newspaper, Pinghu] On the morning of the 19th, Wang Xinzeng, the owner of Yuebin Restaurant at the Jian'guo Road intersection in the urban area, was detained by the police station for five hours by Director Wang of the police station on the grounds of "unsanitary, violating summer sanitation" for demanding 1.9 million yuan in arrears for alcohol from Director Wang, without receiving a penny.

### Prices Soar, New Measures Adopted Everywhere

[Report from Our Newspaper, Wujin, 20th] The county government, the council, the chamber of commerce, and the grain industry have decided to set up five supply stations in the city to provide relief to the poor at a low price, with a five-day period. The price will be 85% of the market price of medium-ripe rice, and each poor person will receive five sheng. The difference will be sought from the accumulated grain. It is planned to try it out for two periods first. Also, after the rice rush, emergency measures were taken, ordering each rice shop to sell medium-ripe rice, with a limit of two sheng per person. The price of rice was rigidly set at 9.5 million yuan, plus a reasonable profit. On the second day of the market, all the rice was red-spotted broken rice, causing a gust of wind in the market. Each business was summoned by the county government, and medium-ripe rice was compared. It was discovered that the rice quality of Yingtai, He Kang, and other shops was indeed too poor. The conclusion was: if they commit the crime again, they will be punished without leniency. Later, Tongtai Rice Shop in Houtuan Lane did not comply with the price limit, raising the price to 120,000 yuan. After the civilians complained to the city defense department, all the stored rice was confiscated and used for low-priced sales, instructing the civilians to line up and insult others at 95,000 yuan. Two sheng per person were sold out in an instant.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Shaoxing, 19th] The police authorities have arrested black market brokers Han Genlong and others, and are now expanding the arrest to curb the rising trend.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nantong, 19th] The price fluctuation has been very severe in recent days. "Open-air markets" have appeared on the streets. From 9:00 to 11:00 every morning, unscrupulous merchants are often seen selling short in the Chengnan and Yanglu areas, which has a great impact on the market. The Economic Department of the First Appeasement Headquarters has ordered the police station to strictly monitor and crack down at any time.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Jiaxing, 20th] From the 20th, the price of rice will be 10 million yuan per dan.

### Severe Floods in Lakeside Counties of Hunan Province

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 21st] Li Hongyin, a member of the Department of Social Affairs of the Lakeside Flood Survey Team, A. Ruke, a representative of the American Church Relief Committee, Liu Xiuru, director of the Hunan Social Affairs Office, and others, a group of seven people, have returned here yesterday. The group went to the lakeside to conduct an on-site survey of the disaster situation in Yuanjiang, Yiyang, Nanxian, Huarong, Yueyang, Xiangyin, and other six counties, which lasted for six days. It is reported that the disaster areas in the six counties totaled 2.4 million mu. Among them, Pufengyuan and Zhongfu Yuan on the west bank of Datong Lake and Wenwan Yuan under the jurisdiction of Huyin County suffered the most severe disasters. If each mu is calculated at a harvest of five dan of rice, it is estimated that the loss this autumn will reach more than 12.27 million dan. Among the eleven lakeside counties, the losses of the remaining five counties are not included. The number of affected disaster victims is about 520,000, who are currently facing death. It has even happened that the fields have been soaked in water and cannot be rescued, and some people have committed suicide. Li Hongyin and A. Ruke are currently drafting a disaster report and will strive for more relief from the competent authorities. Liu Xiuru believes that in addition to passively providing disaster relief, they should also actively seek to fundamentally manage Dongting Lake.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 21st] The rationed grain distribution here will begin on the 20th, with 114 rice shops distributing at the same time.

### Cash Ben Hosts Reporters to Explain the Mistaken Price of Rice in Beijing

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Cash Ben, director of the US China Relief Mission's Beijing Office, hosted reporters at 4:00 pm on the 21st to explain the misunderstanding of the Beijing Municipal Council and other institutions regarding the price of rice distribution in Beijing in June. He explained that the purpose of rice distribution is to assist in the fair distribution of food at fair prices, while enabling the Chinese government to recover legal currency, stabilize currency, and promote social undertakings. It is not a subsidy or relief. In fact, when the price of rice distribution in Beijing in June was determined, it was already 25% lower than the market price at that time. Compared with the provision in the Sino-US Relief Agreement that it should not be less than 5%, it has already been excessively suppressed. If the price of urban rice distribution is further lowered, the market price will also be affected, which will not benefit the production and marketing of rice.

### Ministry of Finance Prohibits the Sale and Purchase of Silver Coins, Telegraphs the Capital Police Department and the Beijing Municipal Government to Crack Down

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Information from the Ministry of Finance: Since the government implemented the legal tender on November 3, 1935, it has prohibited the sale and use of silver coins.

### Five-Year Plan Drafted by the Sichuan-Kangding-Yunnan Border Affairs Committee

[Aeronautical Report from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 19th] The Border Affairs Design Committee of Sichuan, Kangding, and Yunnan provinces has recently finalized the first five-year plan and submitted it to the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters for record.

### Floods in Counties Upstream of the Min River, Private Property All Washed Away

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st] According to recent reports, the second-largest flood in 100 years is not only limited to Fuzhou, the provincial capital, but also covers the entire Fujian Province. It is reported that most of the population and property in several counties upstream of the Min River have been washed away by the sudden floods. However, due to the interruption of transportation, accurate reports have not yet been obtained. Even if we talk about the situation of the flood that struck Fuzhou at dawn on the 18th, according to the elders who are nearly 100 years old, there was a similar situation in the sixth year of the Qing Dynasty (Tongzhi era), but the disaster situation was not as tragic as today. On the morning of the 18th, when the citizens woke up from their dreams, the flood poured into their houses. They quickly put on their clothes and sat up, and the water on the ground was more than an inch deep. After a little hesitation, the water had already submerged the shoes. They led their wives and children to climb onto the bed, the table, the building, and the roof. At this time, tragedy struck. In the pouring rain, there was only the sound of collapse and cries for help. Most of the houses built with mud walls collapsed one after another. Many people who took refuge on beds, tables, and buildings were crushed to death or drowned. Several foreign buildings were swept away by the flood. The loss of materials such as grain and timber is difficult to estimate. The flood swept across a plain in the suburbs, and all villages, huts, fields, seedlings, and livestock were wiped out. Farmers who could not avoid it were mostly buried in the stomachs of fish. It is reported that in the fire area in Nantai ten days ago, hundreds of displaced disaster victims were sheltered in a temple after being rescued. That night, the flood arrived, and the temple collapsed, causing many people to be drowned and crushed to death. On the 19th, the sky cleared up, and although the flood receded slightly, the disaster area was still submerged in water. There were still tens of thousands of people who were hungry, exhausted, and not out of danger. Due to the sudden onset of the disaster, the government authorities were unable to implement emergency measures, because the disaster area was vast, the boats were scattered, and the government personnel were also among the victims. In short, the loss of population and property was unprecedentedly tragic. The above figures are estimated based on the current situation, and the actual situation may be even worse.

### Flood in Fuzhou Disrupts Communications

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Following the severe flood in Fuzhou, the telegraph bureau's lines were washed away, disrupting wired communication with the outside world from 1:20 PM on the 17th. Wireless communication was also out of service from 7:30 AM on the 18th. However, after efforts to relocate the machine room, wireless communication was restored from 1:00 AM on the 19th. Furthermore, wired communication between Fuzhou and Shanghai, Nanping, and other locations has been restored from 7:00 PM on the 20th after emergency repairs to the lines.

### Nanchang Water Level Rises Above Warning Line

### Survey Concludes on Baihu Mountain for Qiantang River Navigation Dock

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st] Following the completion of the Qiantang River test navigation, the location for the future navigation dock has been surveyed and determined to be Baihu Mountain, located forty li from Hangzhou. The mountain is located on the north bank of the river, approximately twenty li from the Zheshan station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Plans are to cooperate with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to build a branch line along the old Yonglu railway foundation at Zheshan, extending to the Baihu Mountain dock. Surveying work is currently underway, so that in the future, all special products exported from the Hunan-Jiangxi hinterland, or industrial and commercial finished products imported from Shanghai to the hinterland, can be loaded and unloaded here. At the same time, another dock will be built at Sibao to coordinate with the Ministry of Transportation's plan to establish a joint general station for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways at that location, so that goods transported from Shanghai to Hangzhou or from Hangzhou to Shanghai can be loaded and unloaded at this dock. It is reported that this is the most economically sound plan. Once implemented, water transport will be one-third cheaper than land transport. The Jiangnan Steamer, which ran aground during the test navigation, arrived in Hangzhou City on the 19th, taking advantage of the tide.

### Five Firemen in Zhenjiang Fire Case Urgently Need Plasma Treatment

### Dispute Over Demolition of Shanties in the Capital - Shantytown Residents Clash with Military Police - The Minsheng Daily Newspaper Office is Destroyed, Losses Amounting to Approximately 20 Billion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Minsheng Daily newspaper office owned by Cheng Shewo, and his brand-new car worth 5,000 US dollars, were destroyed by people on the afternoon of the 21st, with losses amounting to approximately 20 billion yuan. The destruction was caused by the pursuit and beating of demolition personnel by shopkeepers and shantytown residents whose illegal roadside structures were being demolished by the Public Works Bureau. The Minsheng Daily at Fuminfangkou on Zhongzheng Road had six shops and shanties owned by Feng Deming, Dai Chunchi, Tu Yifang, etc., who had built shops on the sidewalk during the enemy-puppet period. After the victory, Minsheng Daily, the owner of the land behind the sidewalk, constructed buildings, but access was blocked by the shops. The Public Works Bureau repeatedly ordered them to demolish the structures, but they refused to comply. Feng and others repeatedly appealed to the municipal government and the Ministry of Land Affairs, but their appeals were rejected. On the 3rd of this month, the Public Works Bureau summoned the shopkeepers and informed them that all legal procedures had been completed, and that the municipal government intended to repair the sewers and that they should remove the structures. The shopkeepers ignored the order. On the 21st, the head of the Public Works Bureau sent people to carry out the demolition, with over a dozen military police maintaining order. In the afternoon, a dispute broke out between the shantytown residents and the authorities, leading to a clash. Around 4:00 PM, the shantytown residents and other civilians, numbering about one hundred, overwhelmed the police and fled into the Minsheng Daily office. The mob smashed all the furniture, doors, and windows in the business department downstairs. Cheng Shewo had just returned from outside in his brand-new car. Soon after the car was driven into the garage, the shantytown residents opened the garage door, drove the car onto the sidewalk, and smashed all the glass windows on the front, back, left, and right. Cheng and others fled to the third floor to hide. During the pursuit and beating, two policemen, Hong Xiudong and Dong Guanghan, were injured and have been sent to the municipal hospital. After the shantytown residents destroyed the Minsheng Daily, a large number of police officers arrived and arrested several people, who were sent to the court. The Minsheng Daily has also requested the local district court prosecutor's office to inspect the scene. Cheng Shewo has been in Nanjing recently attending meetings of the Legislative Yuan and preparing the Nanjing edition of the World Daily at the Minsheng Daily site. Unfortunately, he suffered this loss, and colleagues in Beijing have gone to offer their condolences.

Those that were killed numbered about one hundred, and well-wishers weighed them, reaching fifteen or sixteen catties.

### Miss Yang Suddenly Falls Ill, Special Car Returns Empty - Miss Yang's Second Stage Examination Plan - Consists of Five Main Outlines - Heads of Clinical and Research Groups Have Been Appointed

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] According to Zhuo Songdai, Miss Yang returned home this morning and suddenly fell ill, causing the special car sent to pick her up to return empty. A more thorough examination is essential, but Zhuo insists on changing the location. It is reported that the location will be changed from near the Zhongzheng Hospital to a sanatorium in Linyuan or Gele Mountain.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Miss Yang, who was originally scheduled to be picked up from Jiulongpo today, suddenly changed her mind on the 20th.

### An Overview of the Work in the Pacification Demonstration Area

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 14th] Subei, in its geographical location, controls the two Huai Rivers and shields Nanjing and Shanghai, which is strategically important. The pacification work in Subei has been greatly developed. The central government attaches great importance to this region and has designated the First Pacification Zone as a national "Pacification Demonstration Zone." In order to implement the new pacification plan, the Pacification Department authorities have designated 30 townships centered on Nantong, extending east to Langshan, Luhongzha, and Mangxiazi, and north to Qinzhao, and west to Tangzha and Tianshenggang as a demonstration area, hoping to create a more complete method and then gradually extend it outward as a model for all counties in the pacification zone. Now, not only are bandits unable to sneak in, but hidden bandits have been completely eliminated, security has been fully established, the people's burden has been reduced a lot, and the people's lives are gradually improving. This is a great success. Total war has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit here. This seed will grow new seedlings in all parts of the pacification zone.

Greenery Everywhere

The first impression when entering the demonstration area is that it is green everywhere. "Planting trees every year does not make a forest," but this year is an exception here. The willows and poplars planted on both sides of the road have grown new branches and leaves. The successful completion of the tree planting work is enough to illustrate the establishment of security and the soundness of the political organization in the demonstration area. Looking at those checkpoints guarding the key intersections with red-tasseled spears, anyone who wants to pass through here must hand over their national identity card to be checked. At the beginning of the demonstration area, many bandit spies were discovered at these checkpoints. From this, it can be seen that the organization of the demonstration area is strict.

The temperature has risen to over eighty degrees, and the farmers are busy transplanting rice seedlings and weeding under the scorching sun. They are now able to engage in production with peace of mind. However, five or six months ago, it was not so peaceful. Before the demonstration area was established, the areas occupied by bandit troops in these thirty townships were less than 10% in four townships, less than 20% in three townships, 30% in two townships, 40% in two townships, and 50%, 60%, and 80% in one township each. After several months of effort, all thirty townships have been completely brought under control.

Four Major Plans

Commander Li has a complete set of methods for establishing a pacification demonstration area. He advocates using military force to protect politics, using politics to develop the economy, and then using the economy to maintain the military. He has formulated four major plans: (1) Strengthening local armed forces, (2) Reorganizing local finances, (3) Improving administrative organizations, and (4) Constructing base point works. This is the prototype of the total war strategy. When this plan was put into practice, it unexpectedly coincided with the total war strategy. The work in the demonstration area has two principles: (1) Local people do local things and local money is used for local purposes, (2) Self-governance is the basis of self-defense, and self-defense is the guarantee of self-governance.

The work in the demonstration area started with politics, military affairs, and the economy moving forward simultaneously. Coordinating with the elimination of scattered bandits and the clearing of "local cadres," township cadres have returned to their posts, fighting the bandits in place, while simultaneously implementing the popular election of Bao chiefs, establishing a democratic style, checking household registrations, reorganizing the Bao-Jia system, implementing joint Bao responsibility, and setting up checkpoints and sentry posts. The reorganization of local finances and the organization and training of self-defense forces have all started at the same time. In less than five months, the expected results have been well harvested in the demonstration area.

Autonomy and Self-Defense

In terms of autonomy and self-defense, the focus is on strengthening grassroots organizations and reorganizing local armed forces. "Every person must be registered in a household, and every household must be registered in a Jia." Under this slogan, not a single household or able-bodied man has been missed. Strict household registration is a common phenomenon in the demonstration area. At the same time, special attention is paid to organizational work. Bao has Bao self-defense teams, and townships have township self-defense teams. They are responsible for checking, guarding, delivering messages, scouting, rescue, transportation, engineering, supply, guiding, and guarding. Young people have youth work teams, children have "youth corps," and women have women's organizations. Even special status monks and Taoists have formed monk and Taoist work teams. In the demonstration area, almost everyone is included in an organization, and ordinary banditized elements naturally have no place to stay. More importantly, a democratic system has been cultivated here, with grassroots democratic training and Bao people's congresses. People can elect or remove Bao chiefs, discuss laws and agreements, listen to work reports from the Bao offices, discuss matters that should be established or reformed in the Bao, and ask questions to the Bao offices. This establishment of a grassroots democratic system is precisely the thorough realization of the principle of people's rights in the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, we must not forget that, throughout the entire work process, the work style of the cadres has been improved. It is difficult to find people who are perfunctory in the demonstration area. While working, everyone learns, and everyone is brave in reviewing and improving, washing away the basic reasons why political orders could not be implemented in the past!

The people here have been subjected to the ravages of enemies, puppets, and bandits. Everyone hates bandits and is afraid of bandits, not knowing how to resist. But after organization and training, they have learned how to defend themselves. They have learned how to prevent traitors and restrain the police. They use bamboo clappers, gongs, and red and green lights to report bandit alarms, and use spears, broadswords, and lances to fight the bandits. The people here can automatically take on guard duties and automatically capture traitors and bandits, making it impossible for outsiders to infiltrate and for insiders to hide. If one township encounters bandits, several townships will jointly defend, using collective action to combat bandit harassment. The people have contributed their own strength to build strong security fortresses in Langshan, Luhongzha, Mangxiazi, Tangzha, Tianshenggang, and other places with Nantong as the core. They have learned to use their own strength to protect their lives and property. "The power of the people is invincible," which can be verified in the demonstration area.

Thorough Deployment

Total war is a war in which politics, military affairs, and the economy are integrated. The demonstration area has thorough deployments in politics and military affairs, and has achieved unprecedented success in the economy. After the landlord finance has been reorganized, a unified fundraising and expenditure method has been implemented. The distribution is gone, the miscellaneous taxes are gone, and the accumulated abuses of strict seizure and use have been swept away. Local political figures in Nantong have organized a temporary expense management committee for the pacification area to plan uniformly. Under the supervision of the Pacification Department authorities, the people's burden has been generally reduced. In the past, the most free distribution area would distribute more than 2,000 shi of rice per month, and the least would be around 1,500 shi. However, self-defense team members and public and educational personnel could not even eat their fill. Since the unified fundraising and expenditure, the people's burden has been reduced by at least one-half, while the treatment of staff has been improved. Public and educational personnel are paid uniformly in kind (rice), divided into four levels: two shi, one shi six dou, one shi four dou, and one shi two dou. The police and security personnel all receive seven dou. This salary is not affected by price fluctuations, and the lives of the staff can be stabilized, so the work enthusiasm and work efficiency have also been relatively improved. The demonstration area is now engaged in land reform and is also promoting cooperative undertakings, hoping to improve the lives of the general public.

Brilliant Achievements

The Pacification Demonstration Area has achieved brilliant results in a short five months of efforts in both suppressing bandits and building, not only eliminating bandit traces in the territory, but also preventing bandits from daring to commit crimes in the border areas. Grassroots politics have a solid foundation, and local armed forces have unleashed vast potential forces. The people's burden has been reduced in terms of finance, the treatment of staff has been improved, and the people's lives have been generally and gradually improved. This is a great success. The simple, pragmatic, and realistic plan has concrete results, and we look forward to this seed taking root, blooming, and bearing abundant harvests in the pacification zone.

### Opening of the Republican National Convention in America; Vigorous Campaigning Unfolds; Dewey Gains Momentum; Vandenberg May Emerge as a Dark Horse; First Ballot Scheduled for the 24th

[United Press, Philadelphia, USA, 21st] The 24th Republican National Convention opened here today. Judging from various indications, the competition for the presidential nomination will be very intense. A total of 1,094 delegates from all 48 states, Hawaii, Alaska, and other regions are attending the convention. A candidate must obtain a majority of 548 votes to be nominated. Delegates will vote openly, with each state announcing its vote count. If all delegates from a state agree to support one person, the head of the delegation will stand up and announce it. Sometimes, delegates from a state are divided, with one faction supporting Candidate A and another supporting Candidate B. For example, out of the 29 delegates from Wisconsin, 8 are committed to electing MacArthur, while 19 support Stassen. The method of selecting delegates also varies from state to state. They may be elected by Republican voters in state elections or by Republican state conventions. Each state can decide for itself, and there is no uniform method. Delegates attending the convention may be instructed to elect a certain person or guaranteed to elect a certain person. These instructions or guarantees are the result of delegate elections in each state or agreements reached in state conventions.

[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 20th, Associated Press] On the eve of the Republican National Convention's vote for a presidential candidate, competition among party leaders is fierce. New York Governor Dewey is eloquent and gaining momentum, but still lacks the certainty of being elected. Taft and Stassen also have strong power and are unwilling to yield. Judging from the current situation, it is possible that none of the three will obtain the 548 votes required for election. If that happens, as a result of compromise by all parties, Senator Vandenberg may emerge as a dark horse and win. The convention will hold its first ballot on the 24th. Dewey is expected to receive more votes than the other candidates, with Taft coming in second and Stassen last. The number of votes each candidate can obtain is kept strictly secret, as candidates do not want to stake everything on the first ballot. They plan to conserve their energy for the second and third ballots, using their power to strengthen their psychological influence. Each candidate must gradually strengthen his power in the National Convention. If the number of votes decreases midway, he will fail. Dewey arrived in Philadelphia by car today and immediately assured all parties that if the convention fails to elect a candidate after starting the voting, he will not allow the campaign teams to negotiate secretly and seek a compromise. Dewey told the press that the convention should continue to meet without interruption until a candidate is elected. This would avoid candidates engaging in "buying and selling" after a deadlock has formed. Taft arrived later due to his involvement in congressional affairs. Taft also came by car and immediately told reporters: This election is mainly for him and Dewey, and said: "I am confident that I can win." Taft estimated that he could get 300 votes in the first ballot. Stassen predicted that he would be elected, saying: "There are many Republicans here, but only I can decisively defeat Truman." Stassen's campaign staff predicted that Dewey would get 300 to 350 votes in the first ballot, Taft 250 to 300 votes, and Stassen 175 to 200 votes.

### Draft Republican Party Platform; Focuses on Firm Stance Against the Soviet Union; Guarantees Assistance to Peace-Loving Countries

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 20th] Lodge, chairman of the preliminary proposal drafting committee of the Republican National Convention, announced on the 20th that the committee had passed a 2,400-word Republican Party platform. Its foreign policy section is very international but does not have a tendency to "obey only the leader's orders". Lodge said: This year's platform is the shortest in party history. It will be submitted to the formal motion committee for approval on the 21st, and then submitted to the delegate assembly for a vote on the 22nd or 23rd. It is said that the platform upholds Vandenberg's bipartisan foreign policy, calls for supporting the United Nations, aiding Europe, and taking a firm stand against the Soviet Union and its satellite states. The platform includes 80 items and opens with a 400-word preface stating the Republican Party's doctrine. It is expected that when submitted to the formal motion committee on the 21st, it will be opposed by some non-internationalist party members.

[United Press, Philadelphia, USA, 20th] The Republican Party began organizing the 1948 platform today. The platform guarantees (1) that the purpose of foreign policy is to safeguard free America in the free world. (2) Within the scope of American economic well-being, it will assist other peace-loving countries based on self-help and cooperation (such as the Marshall Plan). (3) It will support reciprocal trade agreements while protecting American industry with government orders. The first draft was prepared yesterday, and its content is still kept secret. It is vaguely heard that it still advocates that the United States lead the anti-communist movement. The party's isolationist faction attempted to rise but failed.

### Reece's Opening Speech; American People Must Choose Between the Republican Party and the Communist Party

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 21st] Reece, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in his opening speech to the Republican National Convention that the American people must choose between the Republican Party and the Communist Party. Reece also said that he believes that the nation will undoubtedly elect the Republican Party in the November election. Reece stated: "There are two major political forces in the world today. They represent two completely opposite types of government. One is the Republican Party of the United States, the traditional pioneer of constitutional government and the firm guarantor of individual freedom. The other is the Communist Party, a part of what can be said to be an international conspiracy aimed at destroying free government. Its headquarters are in Moscow, but its henchmen and followers are almost all over the world, and unfortunately, the United States is also one of them. Communists have been secretly and gradually occupying important positions inside and outside the government since the "New Deal" regime." Reece also said: The Democratic Party has been "split by ideological and regional differences" and "cannot effectively resist the aggression of radical elements."

### Third-Party Campaign Rejected; Wallace Scolds Truman

[Associated Press, Cleveland, 20th] The Ohio Secretary of State Hamill refused to include the names of Wallace's third-party candidates on the election list when Ohio elected the president. To protest, the Wallace faction held a public meeting on the 20th, and Wallace himself delivered a speech, calling Truman a "self-proclaimed saint," and saying his head was "bigger than the halo above his head," and also calling the president "always shifting the blame to others." Wallace's words are considered the most severe criticism of Truman among presidential candidates.

### Truman Drafts a List of Formidable Opponents

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] President Truman now believes that New York Governor Dewey will be the strongest enemy that the Republican National Convention can elect to oppose Truman, while Speaker of the House Martin is the easiest for Truman to defeat. According to sources at the White House, Truman recently discussed with some subordinates and listed the order of political enemies from strong to easiest to deal with as follows: (1) Dewey, (2) Stassen, (3) Warren, (4) Vandenberg, (5) Taft, (6) Bricker, (7) Martin. As for General MacArthur, he is not on the list of Republican candidates that Truman mentioned.

Italian Prime Minister Warns Communist Party to Lay Down Arms Immediately

[Associated Press, Florence, 20th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi delivered an important speech here today, warning its production line to quickly hand over all privately hidden weapons. He also said that the Italians do not want to see the country become a "bridgehead for the expansion of political attitudes from the East."

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 20th] The independent left-wing organ "Il Tempo" commented today on the sudden trip of Italian Communist leader Togliatti to Central Europe, saying, "Some people believe that the situation between the East and West blocs will be tense, causing a new wave of class struggle and unrest. On the other hand, some people believe that the Communist Party will abandon its people's front policy to prevent its status from declining."

### After West Germany Implements Monetary Reform; East Implements Protective Measures; Only One Type of Currency Allowed to Circulate in Berlin

[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] The German Economic Commission of the Soviet Zone has scheduled a special meeting in Berlin this afternoon to draft the final plan for monetary reform in the Soviet Zone and Berlin. Finance ministers of the Soviet Zone's states and leading figures in the German financial community will also hold a meeting with Maritin, the chief financial advisor of Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky.

[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] People close to the German Economic Commission of the Soviet Zone revealed that monetary reform in the Soviet Zone will not be implemented immediately, but some protective measures may be taken this week, such as marking the old mark notes used in the Soviet Zone.

[United Press, Berlin, 20th] Soviet Commander Sokolovsky sent a letter to US Commander Clay today, condemning West Germany's monetary reform as illegal and firmly stating that only one currency should circulate in Berlin.

### No Man's Land Created at the Border Between East and West Germany

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] The border between the Soviet Zone of Germany and the four occupying zones has been created by the Soviet army and German police as a no-man's land with a width of 19 to 40 kilometers. According to reliable sources, the Soviet authorities implemented a complete blockade between East and West on Monday morning.

[United Press, Berlin, 20th] The U.S. military stopped supplying the American community in Berlin via railway tonight to avoid inspection by the Soviet army. If this situation continues, the 10,000 Americans in Berlin will have to rely on air supply.

### Philippines Issues Amnesty; Farmer Guerrillas; Two-Year Civil War Ends

### Labor Filipinization Bill; Not Actually Rejected

President Asks Congress to Make Appropriate Amendments

[Central News Agency, Manila, 21st] It has been learned that although Philippine President Quirino has vetoed the Labor Filipinization Bill, the path for the current Congress's special session to formulate another bill that does not include the "defective provisions" in the vetoed bill has not been completely closed. The president's actions the night before were not an absolute veto but merely returning the bill to Congress, asking for appropriate amendments to its fundamental defects. Quirino also informed Congress, stating, "In view of the large number of unemployed Filipinos in the country, and the fact that economic development is incomplete and empty unless the unemployed are employed in commerce and other economic activities."

Many documents were also seized from the headquarters of the Malayan National Party and the Penang General Labor Union.

### Discussing the Situation in Europe (Continued to Conclusion)

— Mu Geng

Will War Break Out?

(III)

This estimate of the possible arrival of war has its reasons. But on the other hand, there are also reasons why war will not break out immediately or soon.

First, after the experiences of the two world wars, we can imagine that anyone with a brain will definitely handle things carefully. It is possible that things that lead to war (unless he has absolute certainty of victory and is determined to fight, which is another matter), and everyone will probably think that if there is a war today, it must be global. Since the scale is large, the possibility of a long-term war is greater than a short-term war. Therefore, there are many factors that need to be estimated before the war breaks out, so as not to easily cause a war.

Second, in the United States, economics and weapons, if it is a situation of two sides fighting, may have an advantage in numbers. But on the other hand, there are also some shortcomings. One is that from the perspective of the United States' interests, it is best to have someone fight on its behalf. However, today, whether in the Far East or Europe, although the population may be no less than that of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the degree of industrialization in Western Europe, just in terms of industrial technology, may be higher than that of Eastern Europe, it seems that there is no country that can take on the mission of "fighting on its behalf." If war does break out, depending on the situation, Americans will have to go to the field themselves. From the perspective of Americans, whether they are willing or still trying to support a "fighting on its behalf" character is still a problem. Second, geographically, launching a long-distance expedition is also something that the United States needs to consider and plan. Third, even if the atomic bomb is unique to the United States, whether it can solve the war, or whether the number of atomic bombs that the United States has reached the point where it can win, is also a problem. Under these circumstances, the United States needs to consider war.

Third, in the Soviet Union, it has a geographical advantage and may be invincible in Europe. But it is very clear that the war will not be limited to Europe. In a long-term war, even if it occupies the entire European continent, it may not be able to achieve the final victory. Although the atomic bomb may not be able to end the war, it is still a very difficult weapon to deal with. And at present, according to estimates from all sides, the Soviet Union may already know the principle of the atomic bomb, but knowing the principle does not necessarily mean that it can be manufactured. It seems that the Soviet Union's atomic bomb may still be in the process of being manufactured. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's industry suffered great damage in this war. Whether it has been restored to a point where it can fight is also a problem. Not only that, the Western European countries are engaged in restoration under the Marshall Plan, which cannot be successful in a year and a half, so there is no need to worry too much. From the perspective of the Soviet Union's interests, it is best for all countries to follow the path of the Eastern European countries, and the current situation in the Eastern European countries does not rely on force. If it can achieve something without using force, then why must the Soviet Union "fight"? At least for now, it seems that the Soviet Union has not fully established its internal strength (including the Eastern European countries).

Fourth, in addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, there are also Britain and France, which are also the protagonists on the European continent. The current situation in Britain is that economic issues are above all else. It may not want to and may not have the strength to fight again. Under the Labor Party government, in theory, it should be a buffer between the United States and the Soviet Union. In fact, although it has not achieved this point, it is working hard on some important reforms in domestic affairs. From the perspective of Britain's interests, even if it is assumed that war is inevitable, it should delay the arrival of war as much as possible. Therefore, it is impossible for it to provoke war. The internal situation in France is far less stable than that of Britain. It is undeniable that the government authorities hope to eliminate warfare.

In short, according to the current situation, only the United States and the Soviet Union can be qualified to talk about war. Whether war can be completely avoided is another question. At least for now, there does not seem to be a sufficient reason for it to break out immediately. (London Communication, May 21)

### US Military Support for Western Europe; Negotiations Will Be Held in Government Soon

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 21st, broadcast: Washington news, it is learned that representatives of Western European countries will soon hold a meeting with senior US defense officials. This meeting will likely be held in Washington and will open a new chapter in the relationship between the United States and Europe. As Vandenberg had previously proposed a resolution in the Senate supporting a regional defense alliance, which has been passed by the Senate, the above-mentioned meeting will generally take this resolution as a starting point, thereby establishing a close relationship between the United States and the Western European alliance that has already been established. The initial work of the negotiations will mainly focus on military affairs, and political negotiations are expected to follow. The purpose is to determine that the United States will support Western European countries in resisting any armed aggression. These regional agreements will be within the scope of the United Nations and must be approved by Congress.

### Reviewing the Achievements of This US Congress; Thorough Revision of Foreign Policy; The Republican Party's Traditional Isolationism Is Changing

[United Press, Washington, 20th] After Congress passed the Foreign Aid Appropriations Bill and the peacetime conscription bill today, it announced its adjournment. American foreign policy has been thoroughly revised to deal with the Soviet Union's global provocations. The leaders of the bipartisan foreign policy, namely Secretary of State Marshall and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, both expressed their satisfaction.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The 80th United States Congress adjourned on the 20th. Before the adjournment, it spent more time than any previous Congress in American peacetime history and passed more funds for international programs. Foreign observers agreed today that the 80th Congress had made many achievements in promoting American participation in world affairs. Foreign observers are pleased to point out that this Congress, controlled by the Republican Party, indicates that the Republican Party has a trend to change its traditionally nationalistic position. But they had to admit that due to the continuous efforts of a small number of nationalist Republicans to reduce the extent of American participation in world affairs, this trend seemed to be limited. The passage of the World Foreign Aid Program, the extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, the approval of 205,000 European exiles to enter the United States in the next two years, and the passage of various foreign economic programs are clear examples of the general members hoping to support the United States in carrying out its new mission as a major power. But all of this is not enough to cover up many other bills related to foreign countries, which were not acted upon by Congress for various reasons.

The main items that Congress took positive action and passed include the World Foreign Aid Program, whose beneficiaries include China, Japan, Korea, Western European countries, Greece, Turkey, Trieste, etc. Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, extending the president's power to negotiate multilateral trade agreements without Congressional approval. Exile People Act. There is also the Senate's passage of Vandenberg's proposed bill, advocating strengthening the United Nations organization and supporting alliances of friendly countries and aggression. Congress took other positive actions in the international sphere, including approving the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. Passed friendship treaties, merchant shipping and commercial agreements with China and Italy. And passed the Pan-American Mutual Assistance Agreement negotiated in Rio de Janeiro last year. Congress also stated that the United States must fund secondary international affairs, allocating 150 million US dollars to assist the Mexican government in preventing group diseases of livestock, and allocating 150 million US dollars in revolving funds for Japan to use to purchase cotton to revive its textile industry. Other bills passed by Congress, although not directly related to international cooperation, are also of great importance, such as Congress passing a greatly enhanced military equipment plan, restoring conscription, increasing funding for the navy and army, and expanding the air force to 70 air wings. Congress's actions in terms of military equipment and conscription were caused by the fear of Western countries due to the communist coup in Czechoslovakia. Without this communist action, Congress might not have passed this peacetime conscription bill, nor would it have strengthened the American military equipment to such an extent.

But Congress took action on more than 20 international events. Some proposals disappeared in the committees without being submitted to the Senate or the House of Representatives. Some were supported by the House of Representatives but were never discussed by the Senate. According to observers, the responsibility for the failure to take action on these proposals should be shared equally by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The main events in the state of stagnation include the government's proposed suggestion for modernizing the military equipment of Pan-American countries. According to this suggestion, the United States should supply Latin American countries with new weapons in exchange for their old weapons. Congress also did not take action on the suggestion to allow the United States Export-Import Bank to increase its loan capital by 500 million US dollars so that it could provide more loans to South American countries. Congress also did not pass the International Wheat Agreement. According to this agreement, the United States and other major wheat-producing countries should stipulate the maximum and minimum prices of wheat for the next five years with most of the wheat-consuming countries. The case is still within the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has never been submitted for report. The final deadline for approving the wheat agreement is July 1, so this case must be renegotiated before it is resubmitted to the next Congress. Congress also did not pass a bill to compensate Switzerland for 1,250 US dollars to compensate for accidental losses caused by the US Air Force in Switzerland during the war. Members also shelved the suggestion of trying to negotiate with Denmark to purchase Iceland for 2 million to 3 million US dollars and did not take action. Congress passed a measure giving Philippine veterans the right to live in hospitals, but this move is only one of a wide range of measures. According to a wide range of measures, all Philippine veterans who participated in the last war should be given all the rights of American veterans. In addition, other bills that disappeared without being acted upon include suggestions to prohibit or restrict the transport of raw materials to the Soviet Union. Reduce or cancel the balance of the loan owed by Finland to the United States in the First World War. And about 50 bills on the Palestine issue. These bills are to lift the arms embargo in the Middle East, investigate the policy adopted by the State Department on the Palestine issue, and even require Britain to change its Middle East policy, etc. Congress also did not pass the suggestion to appeal for the unification of Ireland.

昨日上午九時卅分，行禮如儀後，主席潘議長登台致開會詞，除痛陳第五次大會後三個半月來，滬市政治經濟社會之急遽演變外，並强調參議會及參議員職責之重大，語重心長，沉痛激昻，前後逾一小時，聽者動容，連連鼓掌，脫口附和者亦不乏人。
Yesterday morning at 9:30 a.m., after the formal opening ceremony, Speaker Pan took the stage to deliver the opening address. In addition to lamenting the rapid political, economic, and social changes in Shanghai over the past three and a half months since the fifth assembly, he emphasized the importance of the council and the responsibilities of the councilors. His words were full of significance, solemn, and impassioned, lasting for over an hour, moving the audience who applauded repeatedly, with many spontaneously expressing agreement.
旋市長致詞，表示頗受議長致詞感動，政治方面，渠認爲市參議會成立公用事業調委會及預決算委會，均有其迫切需要。
The Mayor then delivered an address, stating that he was deeply moved by the Speaker's address. In the political sphere, he believed that the establishment of a Public Utilities Investigation Committee and a Budget Committee by the Municipal Council was urgently needed.
經濟方面，更同意議長之致詞，迄目前爲止，查緝金鈔墨市，汽油節約消費，拋米等工作，全國僅上海一地在辦。
In the economic sphere, he agreed with the Speaker's address that, so far, only Shanghai is taking action in the entire country in investigating and cracking down on the black market for gold and banknotes, promoting gasoline conservation, and selling rice.
憔從好的方面着想，如美援運用得當，全國一體合作，相信七月份起，下半年的物價經濟情形，應較上半年好轉。
Looking at the situation optimistically, if U.S. aid is used properly and the entire country cooperates, he believes that the price and economic situation in the second half of the year, starting in July, should improve compared to the first half.
參議員代表王先靑致詞稱：議長及市長致詞，均係出自肺腑之吾，渠强調目前切要之圖，在安定民生，故希望大家與議長市長通力合作，穩定上海。
Councilor Wang Xianqing, representing the councilors, stated that both the Speaker's and the Mayor's addresses came from the bottom of their hearts. He emphasized that the most important task at present is to stabilize the people's livelihood. Therefore, he hoped that everyone would work together with the Speaker and the Mayor to stabilize Shanghai.

### 潘議長開幕詞　論窮變通　勉同仁應特別鄭重　為民主政治打基礎
Speaker Pan's Opening Address: On Change and Adaptation; Urging Colleagues to be Extraordinarily Cautious; To Lay the Foundation for Democratic Politics

潘議長開幕詞全文如次：
The full text of Speaker Pan's opening address is as follows:
市長，各位局長，秘書長，各位來賓，各位參議員同仁：
Mayor, Directors, Secretary-General, honored guests, fellow councilors:
本會第五次大會三月六日休會以後，時光迅速，今天又在這裏舉行第六次大會了。
Since the adjournment of the fifth session of this council on March 6th, time has flown by, and today we are holding the sixth session here again.
這三個半月之中，無論政治經濟文化社會各方面的現象，都有顯著的變動，變動是當然的，因爲我們當前的國是，確已到了應該窮則變，變則通的時候了，不過我們同時必須注意，所以要求「變」者，乃爲求其能「通」，決不是希望其變而更亂更糟。
In these three and a half months, there have been significant changes in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and society. Change is, of course, inevitable, because our current national affairs have indeed reached a point where "when things reach an impasse, change is necessary, and change leads to progress." However, we must also be mindful that the reason we seek "change" is to achieve "progress," and certainly not to see things become more chaotic and worse.
上海是中國的第一大都市，無論就政治經濟文化社會任何方面講，任何變動首先受到影響，反應也最靈敏。
Shanghai is China's largest metropolis. In terms of politics, economy, culture, or society, any change first affects Shanghai, and the reaction is the most sensitive.
而上海市的一切動象，尤其足以影響到全國。
Moreover, all movements in Shanghai are particularly likely to affect the entire country.
公展深覺本會同仁，在這個應該「窮則變」的時代，來開會來議事，的確大家要特別謹愼鄭重，不論提案，發言，討論，表決，都須爲整個國家民族着想，全市市民福利着想，萬不可夾雜絲滬的偏見和意氣，才能替中國初期萌芽的民主政治，在地方上打好足資表率的基礎，才能替上海全市四五百萬市民，多少减輕一些痛苦，多少解除一些煩悶，多少保障一些安全和應享的基本權利。
I deeply feel that we, as members of this council, holding meetings and discussions in this era where "change is necessary when things reach an impasse," must be especially cautious and solemn. Whether it be in proposing motions, speaking, discussing, or voting, we must consider the entire nation, the welfare of all citizens, and avoid any prejudices or sentiments. Only in this way can we lay a solid foundation for China's nascent democratic politics at the local level, serving as an example, and somewhat alleviate the suffering, dispel some of the anxieties, and ensure the safety and basic rights of the four to five million citizens of Shanghai.

憲政基本精神　必須由下而上
The Basic Spirit of Constitutionalism Must Be From the Bottom Up

在這三個半月之中，隨便舉行一二件變動的跡象來說吧，政治方面，行憲的國民大會已經開會，首任的總統副總統已經選出，並且宣誓就職已滿一月，中央政府的五院，也已依照憲法次第組成，尤其是行政院報吿了新的施政方針，立法院熱烈的質詢和討論，凡此都足顯示中央政制確已踏上了憲政的新階段。
In these three and a half months, let me randomly mention one or two signs of change. In the political sphere, the constitutional National Assembly has convened, the first President and Vice President have been elected, and they have been sworn into office for a full month. The five branches of the central government have also been gradually established in accordance with the Constitution. In particular, the Executive Yuan has reported new policy guidelines, and the Legislative Yuan has conducted vigorous questioning and discussion. All of this is sufficient to show that the central political system has indeed embarked on a new stage of constitutionalism.
但是以公展之愚，總以爲民主憲政的基本精神，必須由下而上，斷不是由上而下。
But in my humble opinion, the basic spirit of democratic constitutionalism must be from the bottom up, and not from the top down.
目前我們同人所應致力的，自然是急起直追，用加述的功夫，完成地方自治的一切工作。
What we colleagues should strive for now is to quickly catch up and make greater efforts to complete all the work of local self-government.

自治通則　未見頒訂
Autonomy Regulations Have Not Been Issued

省縣自治通則，遲遲未見頒訂，而直轄市的自治法規，尤覺渺茫。
Regulations on provincial and county autonomy have not been issued, and the autonomy regulations for municipalities directly under the central government seem even more remote.
本會同仁似乎知道，上海一市，開埠最早，人口最多，工商最發達，講到民主憲政基礎的地方自治，當仁不讓，上海市自有首先試驗實行的資格。
It seems that the councilors are aware that Shanghai, as the earliest port city, with the largest population, and the most developed commerce and industry, should not be outdone when it comes to local self-government, which is the foundation of democratic constitutionalism. Shanghai has the qualifications to be the first to experiment and implement it.
老實說，上海後前的公共租界範圍，就是一個自治體的機構，其市政成績如何當爲有目所共覩，當時市民有任何違犯刑事的行爲，沒有不經過法院判決的。
Frankly speaking, the former Shanghai International Settlement was an autonomous body. Its municipal achievements are obvious to all. At that time, any criminal behavior by citizens had to go through court judgment.
巡捕房逮捕人犯，一定要有法院的拘票，且在廿四小時內一定要解到法院，這都是衆所周知的事例。
When the police arrested criminals, they had to have a warrant from the court and had to be brought to court within 24 hours. These are well-known examples.
公展不是說租界時代的設施樣樣都好，而至少一般市民都有一種感覺，當時市民納了稅，舉出了管理市政的董事，多少替市民監督了市政當局，幹好若干項市政，而市民的生命財產也至少有法律的保障。
I am not saying that everything in the Settlement era was good, but at least the general public had a feeling that the citizens paid taxes, elected directors to manage municipal affairs, somewhat supervised the municipal authorities on behalf of the citizens, did a good job in several municipal projects, and the lives and property of citizens were at least legally protected.
我們現在做了將近兩年的參議員，究竟對市政有什麽貢獻，究竟對地方自治盡了些什麼力量，究竟對若干市民所受法外的壓迫，做了些什麼解除他們痛苦的工作，回憶及此，深深値得大家反省。
Now that we have been councilors for nearly two years, what contributions have we made to municipal administration, what efforts have we made to promote local self-government, and what have we done to alleviate the suffering of citizens who have been subjected to extra-legal oppression? Reflecting on this, it is deeply worthwhile for everyone to reflect.

將上上海市　視同肥肉
To Regard Shanghai as a Piece of Fat Meat

我們試想以上海這樣一個可以充分自治的地方，未必沒有可以充分自治的人才，更不能說他們不會頒訂因地制宜因時制宜的自治法規和市政制度，然而在積習相沿的中央集權政制之下，在中央還沒有頒訂省縣自治通則的時候，甚至還沒有十分注憲到直轄市在地方自洽制度上的優先地位的時候，更甚至十目所視十手所指，看成上海市是中央的一塊大肥肉，未必肯絲毫放鬆他們許多不合情理的管制政策的時候，我們徒負地方民意襲關名義的市參議會，究能有什麽作爲呢？
Let us consider that a place like Shanghai, which can be fully autonomous, may not lack talents for full autonomy. Furthermore, it cannot be said that they cannot issue self-government regulations and municipal systems that are adapted to local conditions and circumstances. However, under the long-standing centralized political system, when the central government has not yet promulgated general rules for provincial and county self-government, and has not even paid much attention to the priority of municipalities directly under the central government in the local self-government system, and even more so, it is seen by all as a large piece of fat meat for the central government, they may not be willing to relax their many unreasonable regulatory policies in the slightest. What can we, the Municipal Council, which bears the name of local public opinion, do?

官僚思想　在上控制
Bureaucratic Thinking Controls from Above

說句笑話罷，我們第五次大會決議組織了一個公用事業調查委員會，我們想盡市民代表的責任，調查一些公用事業如何開支，如何經營，爲什麼不能不大漲特漲的原因何在，庶幾可以公吿市民，大家可以在合理範圍內答允增加一些負祖，這是民意機關應盡的職責，而偏有官腔十足的中央部會大打官話，說我們是越權，是違法。
To make a joke, our fifth assembly resolved to organize a Public Utilities Investigation Committee. We wanted to fulfill the responsibility of citizen representatives and investigate how public utilities are spending money, how they are operating, and why they cannot help but raise prices drastically. In this way, we can inform the citizens so that everyone can agree to increase some of the burden within a reasonable range. This is the duty that the public opinion organ should fulfill. However, central ministries with full of bureaucratic tone made official remarks, saying that we were overstepping our authority and violating the law.
條這樣陳腐的官僚思想在上面控制，那裏可以望得到有眞正的地方自治和民主憲政？
With such obsolete bureaucratic thinking controlling from above, where can we hope to have genuine local self-government and democratic constitutionalism?

應為市發民　爭取自治
We Should Fight for Self-Government for the Citizens of the City

所以我們首先應該堅强的站得起來，爲上海全市四五百萬市民爭到我們應享的自治權利，我們要在很短期間，盡我們的力量，擬訂法制，使市民納地方的稅，管地方的事。
Therefore, we should first stand up firmly and fight for the rights to self-government that the four to five million citizens of Shanghai should enjoy. We must, in a very short period of time, do our best to formulate laws so that citizens pay local taxes and manage local affairs.
必如此，我們才能做到由下而上的民主，由下而上的憲政，才能眞正保障人民在憲法上應享的基本權利。
Only in this way can we achieve democracy from the bottom up, constitutionalism from the bottom up, and truly guarantee the basic rights that the people should enjoy under the Constitution.
也必如此，我們國家才有「窮則變變則通」的光明前途。
Only in this way can our country have a bright future of "change when things reach an impasse and progress through change."

挽救經濟危機　應求變而能通
To Save the Economic Crisis, We Must Seek Change and Progress

三個半月變動令不不寒而慄
The Changes in Three and a Half Months are Chilling

其次看到經濟現象，在些三個半月中的變動，尤使我們不寒而慄。
Next, looking at the economic phenomena, the changes in these three and a half months are particularly chilling.
在三月初的第一週，上海批發物價指數爲：
In the first week of March, the wholesale price index in Shanghai was:

類名　上週指數
Category Name: Last Week's Index

食物類　二七五·八七〇
Food: 275.870

紡織品類　三五一·六三〇
Textiles: 351.630

燃料類　三四二·八五〇
Fuel: 342.850

金屬類　三〇五·一九〇
Metals: 305.190

建築材料類　三三三·一六〇
Building Materials: 333.160

化學品類　五五三·一四八
Chemicals: 553.148

雜貨類三　〇〇·三七〇
Sundries: 300.370

指數　三三〇·七五〇
Index: 330.750

而在本月（六月）第三週的批　　發物價指數則如下：
While the wholesale price index for the third week of this month (June) is as follows:

類名　上週指數
Category Name: Last Week's Index

食物類　九六七·二七五
Food: 967.275

紡織品類　一·五一〇·六七七
Textiles: 1,510.677

燃料類　一·〇九八·五六八
Fuel: 1,098.568

金屬類　一·一七九·五八九
Metals: 1,179.589

建築材料類　一·三二六·七九
Building Materials: 1,326.79

化學品類　一·八〇八·〇七四
Chemicals: 1,808.074

雜貨類　一·三一八·三二四
Sundries: 1,318.324

總指數　一·二四三·九三三
Total Index: 1,243.933

兩相比較，約言之，食物類漲了三倍半，紡織品類漲了四倍四，燃料類漲了將近三倍，金屬漲了將近四倍，建築材類漲了四倍，化學品類漲了三倍三，雜貨類漲了四倍三，總指數漲了三倍七。
In comparison, generally speaking, food prices have increased by three and a half times, textile prices have increased by four and a half times, fuel prices have increased by almost three times, metal prices have increased by almost four times, building material prices have increased by four times, chemical prices have increased by three and a half times, sundries prices have increased by four and a half times, and the total index has increased by three and a half times.
諸位只要想一想，米價在三月初只三百二三十萬，目前已經超出了一千二百萬，就可知道，我們一般市民，在生活上所受的打擊嚴重到如何程度。
If you just think about the fact that the price of rice was only 3.2 to 3.3 million in early March, and now it has exceeded 12 million, you can know how severely our average citizens are affected in their lives.

如上所說，三個半月中物價如此暴漲，經濟頻於崩潰，此固非地方政府之所能爲力，亦非地方議會之所能挽救，然而我們不能不指出，中央政府負責大員，對於如何挽救經濟危機，似乎不但沒有收到相當效果，並且有時反在那裏促起危機的加重。
As mentioned above, prices have soared so rapidly in the past three and a half months, and the economy is on the verge of collapse. This is certainly beyond the power of the local government, nor can the local council save it. However, we cannot but point out that the senior officials in charge of the central government seem not only to have failed to achieve the desired effect in saving the economic crisis, but also sometimes even contribute to the aggravation of the crisis.
固然中央政府處理物價問題，未始不想有所致力，可惜未盡得法，甚且不願虛心聽取地方公正人士的意見，往往閉門造車，未必合轍。
Admittedly, the central government has tried to address the price issue, but unfortunately, it has not been effective, and it is even unwilling to humbly listen to the opinions of fair-minded people in the locality, often "building a cart behind closed doors," which may not be suitable.
我們要籲請本市市民選舉出來的立法委員，必須替本市市民對中央說幾句公這話，貢獻一些平正可行的意見，首先須請中央大員在求變之中，注意到變而能通，不可使之愈變愈糟，尤其在設計定策之先，必須周到元密，而在尙未決定之時，萬不可隨便濫吹濫說。
We want to appeal to the legislators elected by the citizens of this city to speak a few words of fairness to the central government on behalf of the citizens of this city, and to contribute some balanced and feasible opinions. First of all, we must ask the central officials to pay attention to changing so that it can be implemented, and not make it worse and worse, especially before designing a policy, it must be thorough and rigorous, and before the decision is made, do not arbitrarily make wild claims.

開徵財產稅　徒害工商業
Imposing Property Tax Will Only Harm Industry and Commerce

璧如就財產稅說罷，如何救濟特捐正在開始推動勸導樂捐，忽又來大唱財產稅的高調，以爲即此可以平均社會財富，增裕國庫收入，殊不知財產尙未辦理登記，何從有正確的估計？
For example, let's talk about the property tax. Just as the special contribution for relief is being promoted and voluntary donations are being encouraged, suddenly there is a fanfare for the property tax, thinking that this can average social wealth and increase the national treasury revenue. However, property has not yet been registered, so how can there be an accurate estimate?
而且眞正的豪富早已移其財產於國外，政府奈何他們不得，加以財產稅風聲一來，尙未逃避資產者，也相率效尤，外匯黑市和黃金外幣之狂漲，原因在此，而其結果，則一般平民生計所需的物資，也隨着漲價，如此剩下來在國內的資產，隊了房屋機器生財和工廠製成品或原料而外，幾可終至一無所有，難道竟要遍到連這些僅存的工商業都要拍賣他們的房屋機器生財和產品原料，而後可以稱爲平均財富嗎？
Moreover, the really wealthy have already transferred their property abroad, and the government can do nothing about them. In addition, with the property tax rumors spreading, those who have not yet evaded assets also followed suit, and the black market for foreign exchange and the soaring prices of gold and foreign currencies are caused by this. As a result, the materials needed for the livelihoods of ordinary people are also rising in price. In this way, the assets remaining in the country, in addition to houses, machinery, and factory products or raw materials, will almost end up with nothing. Is it necessary to go so far as to have even these remaining industries and businesses auction off their houses, machinery, and product materials before they can be called average wealth?
故自新財政部長和若干立法委員高唱所謂財產稅以來，說倒還沒有收着，物價則已高起倍許，誠恐一二月後，法還沒有成立，可以變動的資產，則逃避的差不多了，物價漲風也將有增無巳，眞所謂利未見而害已形，天下之至愚，當莫過於此。
Therefore, since the new Minister of Finance and some legislators have been singing the high tune of the so-called property tax, the tax has not yet been collected, but the prices have already risen more than double. I am afraid that after one or two months, the law has not yet been established, the changeable assets have almost escaped, and the price increase trend will only increase, which is truly a case of the benefit not being seen and the harm already manifested. There is nothing more foolish in the world than this.

游資來去　非關上海
The Flow of Hot Money Has Nothing to Do with Shanghai

尤有進者某些人不明事理，總在痛駡上海人說他們囤積居奇，操縱物價，擾亂市場，　取暴利，而歸根一句說，上海的游資作祟，好像這就是上海市民的奇恥大辱，或者是上海市的地方官更尸位議餐。
What is even more, some people do not understand the truth, and are always scolding the people of Shanghai, saying that they are hoarding and speculating, manipulating prices, disrupting the market, and taking exorbitant profits, and in the end, they say that Shanghai's hot money is causing trouble, as if this is a great shame for the citizens of Shanghai, or that the local officials in Shanghai are even more lazy.
其實我們在這個經濟大動亂時期，不禁要問一聲上海的游資是那裏來的，又往那裏去的，公展敬謹代答一句，上海的游資決不是上海市民創造出來的牠們是後東北來的從華北來的，從華中來的·從華回來的，四面八方的游資都集中到上海來搶買物資，搶買外匯或黃金外幣，這些游資的去路，有大勢力的就逃到國外，近到香港，更近到華南，一次之則競變爲物資，在中央政府對整固經濟政策沒有新穎妥善的辦法遏止這個游資洶湧的狂濤，和堵塞游資流往國外和香港的去路以前，公展敢說其他枝枝節節的作爲，都是落空的。
In fact, in this period of great economic turmoil, we can't help but ask where did Shanghai's hot money come from and where did it go? I respectfully answer on behalf of the public that Shanghai's hot money was definitely not created by the citizens of Shanghai. They came from the Northeast, from North China, from Central China, from abroad. Hot money from all directions has converged on Shanghai to snap up materials, foreign exchange, or gold and foreign currencies. The destination of this hot money is that those with great power escape to foreign countries, close to Hong Kong, and closer to South China. Otherwise, they compete to become materials. Before the central government has a novel and proper method to consolidate economic policies to curb the surging tide of this hot money and to block the outflow of hot money to foreign countries and Hong Kong, I dare to say that other piecemeal measures will be in vain.
但偏有一些好時髦唱高調的人，在此時還號召什麽打開上海市的食庫，拿一切物資來平賣，打開上海市的保管庫，沒收一切的財物，在表面看，好像痛快極了，然而我們要問，在一個三民主義的政府之下，還沒有廢止私有財產敎以前，我們政府除了依據法律課稅或徽用而外，有什麽權力可以這樣攪攪。
However, some fashionable people like to sing high-profile tunes. At this time, they still call for opening Shanghai's food warehouses, taking all the materials for equal sales, opening Shanghai's vaults, and confiscating all the property. On the surface, it seems very pleasant, but we want to ask, under a government of the Three Principles of the People, before the abolition of private property, what power does our government have to do this, except for taxing or requisitioning according to law?
如果認爲這樣類乎共產黨的沒收土地，淸算財產的做法。在都市專施行，纔算是平均財富的話，那麽我們爲什麽還要在前方剿減共匪呢。
If it is believed that this kind of confiscation of land and liquidation of property, which is similar to the Communist Party's practices, is only carried out in cities, then it is considered averaging wealth, then why do we still need to suppress the communist bandits in the front?
總之　這種只求變而不求通的辦法，一天一天的胡說，公展深恐他們正在爲淵騙魚，爲數　省，勢必將上海市目前僅存的一些可憐脆弱的工商業基礎，摧殘殆盡了。
In short, this kind of method of only seeking change but not seeking progress, is nonsense day by day. I am deeply afraid that they are digging a pit to catch fish, and in a number of provinces, they will inevitably destroy the little remaining fragile industrial and commercial foundations of Shanghai.
到了那時，眞有一天大家只好裁員减工，或　關門大吉，於是失業成羣，秩序

Free Talk: The "Very Stone" of Ganlu Temple
Shui Qing

Anyone who has read *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* likes to visit Ganlu Temple at the foot of Beigushan in Zhenjiang, because everyone knows the story of Liu Huangshu (Liu Bei) seeking a bride at Ganlu Temple. Even now, visitors to Ganlu Temple still randomly point out certain places as the "Son-in-Law Tower" or "Sun Madame's Dressing Tower" according to legends, making it sound vivid, but they are puzzled by the origin of the stone sheep behind the temple. However, this stone sheep was indeed somewhat related to Sun and Liu in those days.

Behind the Duojing Tower in Ganlu Temple, on the long corridor leading to the "Number One Pavilion of Jiangshan," there is a stone-carved sheep. The sheep has the words "Hen Shi" (Very Stone) carved on its body, which is the sheep's name. The stone sheep is kneeling with all four legs, set on a square brick platform, with its head facing the Yangtze River and its tail facing the temple wall. Tourists who pass by like to stroke its body or even ride on it, especially children who love to climb on it. However, very few people know what it is.

It is said that when Cao Cao led an army of 830,000 soldiers to the south of the Yangtze River, Zhuge Liang, on his way to Jiangdong, once rode this stone sheep with Sun Quan to discuss plans to resist Cao Cao's army. However, some legends say that Liu Bei went to Jiangdong and rode this stone sheep with Sun Quan to discuss resisting Cao Cao. Whether it was Zhuge Liang or Liu Bei is uncertain.

The Ming Dynasty writer Pang Shi owned a "Record of the Very Stone Pavilion," which said: "...Zhuge Kongming of the Han Dynasty and Sun Zhongmou discussed plans to defeat Cao Man together, and once sat on this stone. Later generations named it Very Stone. Luo Yin of the Tang Dynasty and Su Wencong of the Song Dynasty both wrote poems about it... A pavilion was built and named 'Marquis Wu's Relic Stone'..." So there was once a pavilion above the Very Stone, but the pavilion is no longer there. Su Dongpo's preface to his poem about visiting Ganlu Temple says: "There is a stone in the temple that resembles a sheep, traditionally called Very Stone; Zhuge Kongming sat on it and discussed resisting Cao Cao with Sun Zhongmou." The poem says: "The Very Stone lies under the courtyard, arched like a crouching ibex; I recall Lord Wolong, who meticulously planned; one conversation secured the Chizi, another sent the old Cao fleeing. His reputation is high without regrets, events have passed, leaving only a sight to see..." These all say that Zhuge Liang and Sun Quan discussed resisting Cao Cao on the Very Stone.

The poem by Luo Yin of the Tang Dynasty says that it was Liu Bei and Sun Quan who discussed resisting Cao Cao on the stone sheep. Luo's poem says: "Purple beard and mulberry canopy pondered here, the Very Stone still remains, the event can be traced: the Han tripod was not stable, so let us hold hands, although the Chu land is beautiful, would it be of one mind? The heroes have passed, it is difficult to ask the times, the moss knows nothing, the days deepen; there are also wine merchants in the market, sparrows chatter, doves gather, talking about trivial matters." "Purple beard" refers to Sun Quan, and "mulberry canopy" refers to Liu Bei, as those who have read *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* know. Wu Yan of the Song Dynasty also has a poem that says: "Two heroes once lingered here, their fame and achievements were not yet secure; the stubborn stone remains where they sat, and people still talk about Cao Man." Cai Juhou of the Song Dynasty also said in his "Kuan Fu's Poetry Talk": "There is a stone in Ganlu Temple that resembles a crouching sheep, roughly shaped, called Very Stone; it is said that Sun Quan and Liu Bei sat on it and discussed resisting Cao Cao." In terms of era, Luo Yin's poem is the earliest. Moreover, among the various accounts, the one that says Liu Bei and Sun Quan discussed resisting Cao Cao on the stone sheep is the most common; since each account says "it is a tradition," then it is not unreasonable to conclude that Liu Bei and Sun Quan discussed resisting Cao Cao on the stone sheep.

The stone sheep is no longer the original from the Three Kingdoms period, but something that has been damaged and replaced by later generations, repaired several times after being damaged again. Lu Fangweng's "Record of Entering Shu" once said: "On the 23rd, I arrived at Ganlu Temple... There is a Very Stone, which the world believes that Zhao Lie of the Han Dynasty and Wu Emperor once sat on together to plot against the Cao family. The stone has been lost for a long time, and the monks of the temple often take a stone to fill the void; tourists stroke and sigh, and the monks and young boys often laugh secretly..." And it is said that this stone was once thrown into the river and later floated back to shore on its own, which is a bit miraculous. The sheep's head has also fallen off before, and there are traces of joining on the neck.

Butterfly Song
Chen Meng'an

Rhyme imitating Zhang Sheren

Butterfly Song, over the wall.
Jade maiden newly bathed, trying on silken clothes,
Leaning on the wind, waiting for him.
Garden fan lightly raised,
Luring it, then flying far away.
Soft fragrant sweat dampens rouge,
Tiring her cloud temples, drooping down.

Magnolia Flower

Two parts of spring have passed,
Just cherish one part of richness.
Let the four-cornered cart wheel,
Never stopped,
Fleeting days.

Prosperous things all scattered,
Enduring the lonely message,
Hating the east wind to death.
Helpless layers of clouds cover the rain,
Annoying the lazy swallows and sleepy orioles.
Meet,

Holding hands by the precious bushes,
Both sleeves tear-stained.
Let's get drunk among the flowers,
Rediscovering old dreams,
Cease washing away the leftover red.

Everything.
Thousands of words,
Only twisting intestines, wanting to connect the will.
Water,
Still teaching mistakes to the returning geese.

The Salaries of American Civil Servants
Fang Ping

Generally speaking, the salaries of American civil servants are far inferior to those of employees in private enterprises. The federal government's total annual expenditure is 40 billion US dollars, and there are one million officials of all ranks. The average annual salary of senior officials is less than 10,000 US dollars. The President's annual salary is 75,000 US dollars, the representative to the United Nations, Austin, earns 20,000 US dollars, and the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lilienthal, earns 17,500 US dollars. However, there are many employees in American private enterprises who earn annual salaries of 50,000 or 100,000 US dollars. Therefore, officials in the American government are often lured away by private enterprise leaders with higher annual salaries. For example, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Paul, with a basic salary of 10,000 US dollars, joined the National Broadcasting Company and received an annual salary of 37,500 US dollars.

Manson, a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, once complained to Congress that his annual salary had been 10,000 US dollars since 1914 and had never been increased. At that time, prices were low, and there was no income tax, so an annual salary of 10,000 US dollars was not considered low, but what about now? 10,000 US dollars is actually only equivalent to 3,700 US dollars in 1944.

Among the 61 American ambassadors and consuls stationed abroad, 35 have to use their private money to make up for the deficiency in their official salaries. Their lowest annual salary is 17,500 US dollars, and the highest is 25,000 US dollars, plus a small amount of allowance (such as travel expenses, etc.). This amount of annual salary for diplomats is very different compared to the United Kingdom. For example, the annual salary plus allowances of the American ambassador to London is 37,000 US dollars, while the British ambassador to Washington has an annual salary of 80,000 US dollars.

In previous international conferences, the daily allowance for American representatives was also not much. For example, at the San Francisco Conference, the American representatives' public expenses were 6 US dollars per person per day, while the Egyptian representatives' expenses were as high as 50 US dollars per person per day. The difference between these two amounts is too great.

The annual salary of American congressmen is 12,500 US dollars, plus an allowance of 2,500 US dollars. Originally, they could have taken more annual salary, but seeing that the salaries of other civil servants were far inferior to theirs, they were embarrassed to start a verbal battle for their own salary increase.

Nowadays, most of the senior American officials express dissatisfaction with the meager salaries of civil servants. For example, after six of his most capable officials resigned recently, the Minister of Agriculture, Anderson, wrote an article expressing his grievances, in which he said: "Under such meager salaries, even the most loyal officials to the country cannot but express discouragement and pessimism!"

Guoping's Cosmetology
Guoping

Egyptian Queen Cleopatra liked to apply eyeliner to make her face look beautiful. She applied green color under her eyes and black color on her eyelids and eyelashes.

Around the tenth century, the British liked to apply green color on their bodies, but soon this custom disappeared imperceptibly. Coincidentally, at this time, the Crusaders brought back exquisite spices and cosmetics from the East, and many noble women rushed to buy them for makeup needs.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the secret recipe for British women's beauty was this: after taking a warm bath, they would use a large amount of wine to wipe their body and face, making their skin clean and delicate. Queen Elizabeth was the first to create this method.

Queen Mary of Scotland's makeup skills were even better. She even bathed in a large amount of pure wine every day. Other noble women bathed in milk to moisturize their skin. When the Puritans rose in the seventeenth century, the revolutionary leader Cromwell once strictly prohibited this "frivolous" habit. However, less than thirty years later, after the restoration of the English monarchy, the trend of bathing in wine and milk was revived.

Authentic Calligraphy of Lost Poems by Mu Zhai Meicun
Qian Dacheng

Qian Qianyi and Wu Weiye were equally famous, and their authentic calligraphy is rarely seen. Last year, I saw a handwritten fragment of the Shoulengyan Mengchao manuscript in Suzhou. Now, at Yang Yuanyang's place, I have seen handwritten poem drafts by the two, which are not included in the collection. The combination is rare. Qian's poem is for Zhang Xianming's seventieth birthday. The words are: "Confucian style, Brahman practice, Taoist attire, the elder's previous life was lightning. The teacher on the turtle's back taught the hidden secrets, the dragon palace child授经方. In the early morning, he touches the pen to write about Qibo, at midnight he lights the lamp to pay homage to the Medicine King. Moreover, he resolves anger with the five-stringed zither, relying on ten fingers and Tao Tang." Below is written: "Mengsou Qian Qianyi wrote in the village of Bigu Red Bean." Who Xianming is, I have no knowledge of. Judging from the meaning of the poem, he is engaged in the art of Qihuang, and can also play the zither. Mu Zhai began to live in the Red Bean Villa of Baimao in his later years, so his script is also old and scattered, with a Su style. Wu's poem is titled: "Late Spring Rain Clears, Brother Wang Shigubei Returns from Baixia, Passes by Plum Blossom Convent, Presents Chrysanthemums Given by Brother Yuanzhi, Requests a Poem, Two Quatrains." The words are: "Frost falls, the wind is high, the path is full of fragrance, loving its posture near Chongyang; one lifetime of planting flowers becomes a habit, 点点秋容傍草堂. Evening fragrance, noble virtue, proud of the wind and dust, blooms all over the east fence, shining on the eye newly; drunk singing in the three paths still resembles my uncle, 松圓重忆旧诗人." Songyuan is Cheng Mengchang, Mu Zhai calls him an old poet. Yuanzhi is unknown, presumably Songyuan's nephew. Below is a postscript by Zhang Shuwei: "These two poems are lost in Meicun's collection, and can be added as a supplement to the collection. On the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month of Jiaqing Bingzi, Shuwei Zhang Tingji recorded at Qingyi Pavilion." In fact, these three poems are all social, stable, and unremarkable. I think the two deleted them when they compiled the collection. However, Qian and Wu are now three hundred years away, and their calligraphy is becoming increasingly rare, so I record it to show those who love to read the poems of Mu Zhai Meicun.

Hiring
Yi Yun

The overuse of personnel in institutions is undeniable today. Every time a new leader takes office, letters of introduction and job applications from all parties flood in like snowflakes. These letters can be divided into three categories: (1) high-pressure big shots, (2) powerful people who mutually benefit, and (3) the leader's relatives and friends. The first type has too much clout and cannot be disobeyed; the second type often joins forces and is inevitable; the third type involves private matters and should be arranged. With these three parties advancing in tandem, and continuing to come, one has no choice but to cut staff. Skilled old staff are eliminated, and incompetent newcomers flood in. The atmosphere is renewed, but efficiency is greatly reduced. It is called austerity, but in reality, it is an increase. The newcomers either receive salaries without having to work, or they are too unfamiliar with the work, or they lack the corresponding ability and experience. However, they occupy high positions, relying only on the power of the recommenders, regardless of how the work is done. If the bureaucracy is like this, how can one ask about anything? The leader may be lenient, but the inside is corrupt. The unscrupulous ones, in turn, seize secrets discovered by subordinates and hold them hostage, so they have to allow them to act recklessly and dare not stop them. The abuses are even more unspeakable.

Over the years, every leader who comes to power often dissatisfies people, far不如每一名伶登台, 大爲衆所歡迎，亦由名伶配角，均經慎選, 如楊小樓必用錢金福, 梅蘭芳必邀姜妙香等角, 即跑龍套打英雄角色, 至少亦須熟練, 方能入選, 故能配合劇情, 演出好戲. “官場如戲場”, 孰知今日官場的用人, 竟不如戲場的慎重, 無怪把國事作兒戲了!

Zola's Dinner
Dongfang Ji Bai

Once, Zola ran all over the Latin Quarter of Paris and could not borrow enough money to eat dinner. He sat on a chair in the Luxembourg Garden. A girl walked over, shivering from the cold, and approached him, saying, "I don't have a penny, and I haven't eaten anything for twenty-four hours."

"I'm the same way!" Zola replied. After thinking for a moment, he took off his coat and said to the girl, "Take the coat to the pawnshop, and you should be able to get enough money for a meal."

At that time, it was freezing cold, but he walked back to his rooftop room in the cold wind, wearing only a shirt, as if nothing had happened.

Dr. Hu Shih was extremely concerned about the lives of young people and often provided practical guidance. Three years before the incident, he published a long article in the Tianjin newspaper, offering three "prescriptions" to college graduates: (1) Find problems: No matter what kind of subject, there are always unresolved problems that must be solved by all means; (2) Cultivate extracurricular interests: Graduates' jobs may not be suitable for what they have learned or liked, so they should develop legitimate interests and activities outside of their jobs. The work that a person does in their spare time is often more important than their job; (3) Have confidence: Today's efforts will surely have future harvests. These three prescriptions are a spiritual relief for young people. Indeed seen and spoken. However, the doctor also set up a letter of inquiry for others, making a more advanced statement. It is said that a college graduate wrote a letter to Hu, saying, "After graduation, I am unemployed, and the problem of eating cannot be solved, so how can I talk about researching problems and extracurricular interests and confidence?" The doctor then offered a fourth prescription to this disappointed person, namely: "Reflect on yourself, don't blame others." And he cited the graduates of Tsinghua and Nankai Universities as examples. A month or two ago, several major banks had already sent people to the north to look for graduates in the economics department, and more than 40 Tsinghua engineering graduates had already been pre-employed by various industries. Many heads of domestic institutions are truly willing to pay attention to selecting talents from various universities! This remark was indeed the actual situation at that time (before the Japanese invasion). Now, one only needs to recall the large-scale construction everywhere thirteen or fourteen years ago, and the number of construction engineers and civil engineers used can be seen.

Mr. Hu also said in that article, "Schools with too easy courses, too lax management, teachers who do not consult, and poor academic styles will send out hundreds of graduates every year, but they should not expect to get good positions. Even if they accidentally get a position, they will definitely not be able to maintain it for long. On the other hand, those graduates from universities that can indeed give students good training rarely fail to find good positions." This saying is especially practical. I will add an explanation: Even if the school is good, but if individuals only obtain a position with a graduation qualification, they will eventually be eliminated due to poor performance. Moreover, I can use my own experience as an example. I graduated with an engineering degree and have the qualifications and opportunities, but because my mental and physical strength cannot withstand the labor, I am afraid of disappointing teachers and friends, so I dare not try it lightly. Also, in terms of the many graduates of the newly opened departments I teach, those who are willing to work hard on their schoolwork on weekdays, and who are diligent, promising, and talented, have mostly become famous in the press and are well-known reporters. Those who do not like to study and are not suited to this path (doing newspaper reporting cannot be too honest, even if they work very hard on weekdays, if they do not get rid of their scholarly air, they will not succeed) cannot stand on their own for long, even if they are reluctantly introduced, all of which are clear evidence.

### Chinese Participate in UN Guard Force to Carry Out Missions in the Holy Land; Bernadotte Busy Preparing for Arab-Jewish Talks

[United Press, Cairo, 21st] Forty-two members of the United Nations Guard Force have arrived here and will depart for the Holy Land on the evening of the 21st.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 20th] Forty-nine members of the United Nations Security Guard departed from New York by special plane yesterday for the Middle East. Before their departure, UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie gave a speech, urging them to strive for peace in the Middle East. Most of the guards are Americans, with only seven non-Americans, including one each from France, China, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Australia. All are wearing gray UN uniforms and carrying .38 caliber revolvers. However, it is not yet known whether they will still carry weapons after arriving in Palestine.

[United Press, Rhodes, 20th] Holy Land war mediator Count Bernadotte said today that the 49 UN guards on their way to the Holy Land from New York will begin their security duties in the Holy Land as follows: (1) Supervise convoys from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and control the quantity and types of goods transported to Jerusalem. (2) Take over the duties of British troops in Haifa and other areas where British troops are withdrawing. (3) Defend the Haifa concentration camp north of Tel Aviv. According to the armistice, Jewish recruits entering Palestine will be detained there.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 20th] The first week of the one-month truce in Palestine has passed, and hostilities throughout the territory have ceased. Military observers from France, Belgium, the United States, Sweden, and Norway are stationed throughout the war zones, ready to report any unfortunate incidents that may occur. Bernadotte is currently handling his work at his headquarters in the Rose Hotel on Rhodes, and he is busy drafting a solution acceptable to both the Arab and Jewish sides. According to Egyptian newspapers this morning, Bernadotte may ask the United Nations to approve a six-month truce and propose a temporary trusteeship for Palestine. If the Arab and Jewish sides cannot reach an agreement after the current truce expires, this system will be implemented.

[Agence France-Presse, Beirut, 20th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha arrived here today to attend the Arab League subcommittee meeting. Lebanese Prime Minister Riad El Solh and Egyptian Foreign Minister were also present. The meeting is tasked with representing the Arab countries in negotiations with Bernadotte.

### De Gaulle's Speech Praises Pétain's Achievements and Calls for Political Reform

[Reuters, Verdun, 20th] General de Gaulle delivered a speech here today on the 32nd anniversary of the Battle of Verdun, stating that France feels its destiny is once again seriously threatened. He mentioned the illusions of the British and American allies regarding Germany and called for reform of the French state. De Gaulle specifically mentioned Marshal Pétain's important role in the Battle of Verdun. Many observers believe this is the beginning of a movement to reunite De Gaulle's movement with Marshal Pétain's supporters. De Gaulle said that today's situation requires us to revisit the mistakes made by the Allies after World War I, the doubts felt by a wounded France itself, and the illusions of the British and American allies regarding Germany, which prevented France from maintaining its position, thus leading to the revival and rearmament of German imperialism. Our foreign policy, following the shortsighted attitude adopted across the English Channel, meant that a great leader in the war, who had made indelible achievements for the motherland in the Battle of Verdun, disappeared with old age due to France's repeated failures. Today, France feels its destiny is threatened again. Internally, economic and social unrest favors those who seek to exploit poverty as a basis for their dictatorial system. Externally, two-thirds of Europe and most of Asia are under the control of the Soviet Union, constituting a vast instrument of domination. If a revived Germany joins forces with it sooner or later, its threat will be even greater. At this time, inappropriate authorities, practically representing only a minority in the country, are gambling the entire destiny of France due to their attitude toward the German question. As De Gaulle was about to begin his speech, the air raid siren in Verdun suddenly sounded, lasting for ten minutes before stopping. De Gaulle's audience protested loudly. De Gaulle said that one can interfere with public demonstrations, but one cannot stop them. Such actions only strengthen the power of the Rally of the French People.

### US Fleet Visits Lisbon

[Reuters, Lisbon, 21st] Fourteen US warships, commanded by Rear Admiral Connolly, commander of the US Fleet in European waters, arrived in Lisbon today for a goodwill visit, scheduled to stay for six days. The US's newest battleship, the USS Missouri, is also among the fourteen ships.

### Hodge Visits MacArthur

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st, United Press] General Hodge, commander of US forces in South Korea, flew to Tokyo today to visit General MacArthur. This trip was not announced in advance. The US military command in Korea is under MacArthur's jurisdiction. According to personnel at Hodge's headquarters, Hodge will confer with MacArthur. US headquarters declined to comment on the issues discussed.

### Beneš Writes Memoirs

[Reuters, Prague, 21st] A close friend of former Czechoslovak President Beneš told our reporter about Beneš's life after his resignation, saying that Beneš felt relieved after resigning. His political life has come to an end, and he will now quietly observe the evolution of the domestic and international situation and complete his memoirs.
