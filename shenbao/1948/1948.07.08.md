### "July 7th" First Army Day; He Yingqin Encourages Officers; Calls to Catch Up with the Era of Science and Technology

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The 7th is the first Army Day. Military organizations, units, and schools in the capital gathered at the National Defense Ministry Auditorium at 8:00 AM to celebrate. Minister He, Chief of Staff Gu, Army Commander-in-Chief Yu, commanders of the Navy, Air Force, Joint Logistics, and Garrison, deputy ministers of the National Defense Ministry, heads of various departments, bureaus, divisions, and offices, as well as officers above the rank of major and representatives from various units and schools, totaling over two thousand people, attended the solemn ceremony. Minister He presided over the ceremony and delivered a sincere speech, encouraging everyone to maintain the glorious history of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, to use the belief in the inevitable victory over the communist bandits to remove obstacles to national reconstruction, and to guarantee the success of national reconstruction. The Army must first achieve unity within itself and then achieve unity with the Navy and Air Force to accomplish the task of suppressing bandits and building the nation. It is especially necessary to continuously improve in battle to achieve modernization and scientificization to meet the new era and promote the glorious history of the Army. After the speech, slogans were shouted, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Today is the "July 7th" first Army Day. Minister He Yingqin delivered a speech to all officers, stating: "Our country's Army has designated the July 7th Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day as its own memorial day, which contains extremely profound significance and extremely serious warning. On this day eleven years ago, the Japanese invaders brazenly launched a war of aggression at Lugou Bridge, which was also the day our sacred Anti-Japanese War began. Relying on the wise leadership of our supreme commander, our Army, in cooperation with the Navy and Air Force, fought hard and finally achieved the final victory under conditions of material poverty and inferior equipment. In commemorating the first Army Day today, the glorious historical achievements of our Army comrades-in-arms who endured hardships, gallantly went to the enemy, and succeeded or died in service, with their loyalty shining brightly, cannot but be particularly emphasized. At the same time, we should also be particularly vigilant. Although military thinkers in various countries are now touting "button" warfare or the decisive role of the air force, they are still not neglecting the strengthening and reorganization of the Army. Because the final occupation still requires the Army. In today's atomic age, in today's era of rapidly improving aircraft performance, how should our Army strive to maintain, develop, and promote the glory of our Army is indeed worthy of our deep study. I believe that scientific progress will change the future of warfare, but I believe that the Army will absolutely have a glorious future. This all depends on all of our comrades-in-arms measuring the long-term prospects of scientific and morphological evolution, truly grasping the needs of reality, understanding the current shortcomings, and striving to improve. The glorious future of the Army will definitely be realized. Our country is a scientifically backward country. To make our Army completely modern, we still lack many conditions. We use "July 7th" as Army Day, which shows that we are absolutely not afraid of difficulties and will strive to catch up with the era of science and technology. At present, we are suppressing bandits and putting down the rebellion. Our conditions in all aspects are much more favorable than they were during the Anti-Japanese War. We must maintain the glorious history of enduring eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and finally achieving victory, and use the belief, perseverance, and determination to win the Anti-Japanese War to remove the obstacles on the road to national reconstruction and guarantee the success of national reconstruction."

### Salaries of Civil and Military Officials Adjusted According to Monthly Index; Implemented From This Month; Executive Yuan Passes Four Recommendations of the Index Evaluation Council; Responsible for Regulating People's Food in Each Province and City

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The method of adjusting the salaries of civil and military officials according to the monthly cost-of-living index was passed at the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 7th and will be implemented from July. The implementation of this adjustment method will greatly increase the burden on the national treasury, but the Executive Yuan has resolutely decided to do so in order to stabilize the lives of civil servants. Furthermore, this method was discussed, decided, and recommended by the Executive Yuan's Civil Service Cost-of-Living Index Evaluation Council on the 6th. The four methods are recorded as follows: (1) The method of investigating and compiling the cost-of-living index for civil servants in major cities and counties will remain the same. (2) Starting in July, the salary for the current month will be adjusted according to the cost-of-living index for the current month. The monthly cost-of-living allowance will be issued at the beginning of the month according to the standard approved for the previous month, and then recalculated after the payment standard for the current month is approved. The cost-of-living allowance for July will be issued in advance at 50% of the payment standard for June and recalculated after the payment standard is approved. (3) The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics will conduct a thorough investigation and compilation of the July index and submit it to the Council for evaluation. (4) Executive Yuan Order No. 30301 of (37) Yu Zi, dated June 29 of this year, stipulates that half a month's cost-of-living expenses should be borrowed in advance according to the June standard as an additional payment for June, and will no longer be deducted. This method has significantly improved the treatment of civil servants, and it was unanimously deemed reasonable when it was submitted for discussion at the political affairs meeting and was approved.

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] In order to coordinate and regulate the people's food supply in various regions, to prevent food panic during the period of shortage between the harvest seasons, and to avoid affecting social order, the Ministry of Food has formulated measures to regulate the people's food supply.

Each provincial and municipal government is responsible for establishing a People's Food Allocation Committee to be responsible for the coordinated regulation of the local people's food supply. It is reported that the above measures have been passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 7th.

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Changsha, 7th] With soaring prices, the actual cost-of-living index for civil servants in June has exceeded one million times. Because agencies in Nanjing and Shanghai have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to increase it by half a month, the Hunan Provincial Government has also followed suit and issued half a month's salary for June as an additional cost-of-living allowance to provide relief.

### Editorial: Rescuing Those Deprived of Education: Helping Students is the Greatest Joy

Summer vacation has arrived. In the past, this was the happiest time for students, but now it has become the most depressing season: university graduates stare at "graduation is unemployment," middle school graduates immediately feel the difficulty of seeking employment, and also feel that the gates of universities are too high, and are also depressed because there is nowhere to go; as for the general middle and high school students still in the middle of their studies, there is a serious problem in their minds, which is the tuition problem for the next semester, which makes them worry so much that they cannot eat or sleep.

In today's era of soaring prices, except for a few wealthy merchants, most families across the country are feeling the threat to their livelihoods under the pressure of high prices, and are simply unable to afford the education of their children; moreover, the tuition fees of various schools must also follow the pace of prices, increasing every semester; although the fees for the next semester have not yet been decided, it is said that all schools will change to collecting tuition in rice, approximately six dan for universities and one dan for middle schools. Even if the current rice price is calculated at 20 million yuan per dan, the tuition fees for universities and middle schools next semester will reach about 100 million yuan; when school starts in September, it is not known how many times the price of rice will rise, just imagine how serious a threat this tuition problem is to middle and lower-class families! Therefore, most students during the summer vacation are worried about the tuition fees for the next semester, and no one is not panicked by the impending loss of schooling.

In principle, the right to education is a right that the younger generation of youth should enjoy, and our country's laws also have this provision; but in today's difficult times, in addition to basic education, it is impossible for the government to fully assume the responsibility of educating the next generation of youth. Therefore, youth deprived of education must rely on the assistance of all sectors of society. In view of this, our newspaper launched the "Readers Helping Students Movement" as early as January of this year, appealing to all sectors of society to generously help students for the vast number of youth deprived of education. As a result, a total of 700 million yuan in student aid funds were raised, rescuing more than 500 university and middle school students, allowing them to continue their studies with peace of mind. We certainly cannot be satisfied with this, but the initial attempt was able to achieve such achievements, which gave us infinite warmth and increased our infinite courage, making us have to continue to work hard and ask society for help for the vast number of youth deprived of education.

This time, our fundraising goal for student aid is tentatively set at 10 billion yuan, hoping to rescue 500 university and middle school students so that they will not lose their schooling due to expensive tuition fees; for the vast number of youth deprived of education, it is inevitable that it will feel like a drop in the bucket, but in today's declining industry and commerce, it is not an easy task to raise 10 billion yuan in a short period of time; and the real purpose of our launch of the "Readers Helping Students Movement" is not the amount of student aid funds raised by our newspaper, but to create a general atmosphere of "helping students is the greatest joy" in society. As long as people from all walks of life are willing to donate funds to rescue youth deprived of education, no matter what the method is, regardless of whether it is handled through our newspaper, we sincerely welcome it.

### Key Points for Improving Overseas Remittances

Before the war, the total amount of overseas remittances was as high as 300 million US dollars per year, while Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan recently reported in the Legislative Yuan that it was as high as 100 million and as low as 50 million US dollars per year; this is quite different from the usual estimates, but it also recognizes the importance of its position in international finance.

Since the opening of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate and settlement methods have been changed several times, and each change has been made under the pretext of absorbing overseas remittances and promoting exports. In fact, it is indeed expected that these two figures will increase. Because import restrictions have been reduced again and again, to the point where they can no longer be reduced, and foreign exchange funds are becoming increasingly depleted, and most of the US aid is in the form of materials, which cannot be used for this purpose. Unless efforts are made to expand from the source, the import trade, production equipment, and industrial raw materials will be difficult to sustain.

However, although the call for absorbing overseas remittances is extremely high, in reality, it is getting worse and worse, decreasing rather than increasing. Finance Vice Minister Xu said: 35 years was more than 32.32 million US dollars, 36 years was only more than 20.1 million, and now it is less than 500,000 US dollars per month. This is such a miserable thing! But this is not due to the real decrease in overseas remittances, but due to the massive increase in evasion. In Hong Kong, the concentration of overseas Chinese funds, and in the Guangdong and Guangdong provinces, the booming of private letter offices for remittances, this is a common sight. Therefore, the decrease in the number of overseas remittances in recent years only proves that the authorities' methods of absorption are not appropriate, and it is not that the source of overseas remittances has dried up. In other words, most of these funds were forced to flow elsewhere. Although the financial authorities have very sincere hopes for these funds, their methods can certainly be said to drive them away, not to attract them. How do you see it? When analyzing the reasons for the decrease in overseas remittances, President Yu of the Central Bank himself stated that it was because the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market was too large. Chairman Liu of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also said that because the official price was too different from the free market price, the value of the currency was depreciated when it was remitted back to the motherland, which led to evasion. It can be seen that the reason why overseas remittances were evaded was that the overseas Chinese suffered too much, and the reason why they suffered so much was that the official price was too low. In addition, there were no major problems. But the authorities knew the reason, but they still refused to revise a reasonable exchange rate, allowing these overseas remittances to escape to other places in various ways. Isn't this intentional expulsion?

Since the authorities want to absorb overseas remittances, why do they actually harass them? This is the subtle point of the issue, and also the subtle point of all economic policies. The original consistent policy of the authorities is to only care about the present, only greedy for immediate gains, only make small calculations, and are unwilling to plan overall and calculate the consequences for the future. This is not only the case with overseas remittances. For example, they only know to increase tax rates and increase income, but they do not realize that it affects the tax base; they only know to repay the principal at 60% of the gold reserves, but they do not realize that it affects credit; they only know to suppress prices to purchase and increase profits, but they do not realize that it affects reproduction; they only know to sell at high prices to enrich the treasury, but they do not realize that it stimulates prices; they only know to reduce the index and save expenses, but they do not realize the lives of public and education personnel; they only know to suppress the official exchange rate in order to receive overseas remittances and export bills of exchange, and naturally they do not realize smuggling and evasion.

Now that we have learned from the pain, we know that it is necessary to encourage overseas capital to return to the country, and we have formulated three measures that will soon be implemented. We hope to learn from the past and avoid the mentality of exploitation. As the saying goes, "The heart of the people is like water flowing downwards." As long as the actual income of overseas Chinese is not much different from the black market income, we do not believe that they will definitely try to evade. If there is a planned suppression and the policy remains unchanged, but the methods are changed, we believe that no matter how it is changed, it will not achieve the expected results.

The inflow of overseas capital is to replenish foreign exchange and exchange for materials, and its benefits lie above the additional benefits obtained by the government at the time of settlement. Therefore, for these remittances, whether they are purchased at a special price or given preferential treatment, the key is still whether they conform to the free market price. Now there are more imported goods and fewer exported goods, and the supply of bills of exchange is obviously far from meeting the demand. We believe that any imported goods, as long as they have been applied for in accordance with the law, obtained permission, and do not violate the regulations on trade management, all overseas remittances and self-provided foreign exchange can be allowed to handle the import of goods, so as to increase investment. It must be known that the value of foreign exchange is different from that of the national currency, but its main function is still no more than a medium of exchange, that is, its ultimate purpose is not the preservation of foreign currency, but the acquisition of foreign materials. Therefore, the import of materials is no different from the inflow of foreign exchange. In the past, emphasizing capital and neglecting materials, and insisting on capital while rejecting materials, cannot but be said to be a psychological illusion. At the time of improving overseas remittances, we hope that all policy, technical, and psychological errors can be completely corrected.

### Yan Jiagan Talks About the Use of US Aid, Emphasizing Production and Construction, Recovering a Part of Currency to Stabilize the Economy

[Report from our newspaper] Yan Jiagan, liaison commissioner of the US Aid Utilization Committee, came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 6th. Our reporter paid a special visit yesterday. According to the conversation, the US aid this time focuses on domestic production and construction, so as to achieve the goal of self-reliance. At the same time, it is hoped that the use of US aid can have an anti-inflationary effect on the country. Selling US aid materials and recovering a part of the currency to stabilize the economy is particularly urgent. He said that the US Aid Utilization Committee is a comprehensive and powerful organization that negotiates decisions and is responsible for promoting them. However, when implementing business, it uses the original organization, so although the responsibility of the Utilization Committee is heavy, the organization is not large.

This time, Mr. Yan accompanied the Steelman Investigation Team to various places for investigation, lasting a total of twelve days, passing through Hankou, Daye, Wuchang, Changsha, Zhuzhou, Pingxiang, Xiangtan, Hengyang, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Pingtung, Taipei and other places. He said: The three major aid sectors in this US aid are: one is Shanghai United Power Company, the second is the Yuehan Railway, and the third is the coal mines on both sides of the Yuehan Railway. In order to understand the facts, the US Economic Cooperation Administration set up an investigation team. The purpose is to investigate whether the established US aid plan is practical and feasible, and whether there are technical revisions. In addition, general related businesses are also given attention at the same time. The results of this investigation are still in the stage of exchanging opinions. Steelman's investigation report is expected to be submitted to the US Economic Cooperation Administration this month. Although the time for this trip was very tight, our country has provided as much information as possible, so as far as the investigation itself is concerned, it should be said to be satisfactory. He finally said that the purpose of the investigation is to study how to make US aid produce the greatest and most effective results for China's construction.

### Minister Chen Zhiping Visits Philippine President to Discuss Ways to Improve Entry for Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Manila, 6th] Our ambassador to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, met with Philippine President Quirino today to discuss the issue of handling the 4,500 overseas Chinese who previously resided in the Philippines. They returned to China due to the war, which prevented them from enjoying the rights of immigration laws to return to the Philippines. 2,000 overseas Chinese who returned to China in 1941 have now been allowed to return to the Philippines, with a provision for 100 people to immigrate each month, of which 75 are from Xiamen and the rest are from eastern China. Minister Chen believes that the monthly immigration number is too small and specially suggested to the Philippine President that 250 people be allowed to immigrate each month. It is reported that the Philippine President told Mr. Chen that he would study this issue. Mr. Chen also asked the Philippine President to reconsider the overseas Chinese who returned to China from 1937 to 1940 and allow them to return to the Philippines, according to the previous recommendation of the International Refugee Organization to the Philippine government to handle the homeless overseas Chinese who once traveled to the Philippines and are now in China under the care of the organization, but no results have been obtained.

### Compensation for Wartime Public and Private Losses Temporarily Difficult to Implement, To Be Handled After the Total Amount of Japanese Reparations is Determined

[Local News] Regarding the issue of how to compensate the people for losses during the War of Resistance, the Municipal Council, based on the suggestions of the citizens last month, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting that a portion of the Japanese reparations materials that have been dismantled and transported back be designated for compensating the people's losses. After research by the Compensation Committee of the Executive Yuan, the Council was replied to yesterday with a proxy telegram Jing Er Zi No. 6114, stating: "1. China's War of Resistance lasted for a long time, and the areas that suffered destruction were extensive. The losses were huge, and the situation was extremely complex. The government should attach equal importance to the public and private losses in various places during the War of Resistance, without making any distinctions. Currently, the total value of materials available for compensation from Japan and how they will be distributed among the Allied countries have not been determined. If compensation is implemented with the limited materials that have been dismantled and transported back, it is practically impossible to distribute them fairly. Forcing it will be difficult to ensure fairness. Based on the above reasons and other relevant technical issues, how to compensate for public and private losses across the country must wait until the total amount of compensation that China receives from Japan is determined, and a separate method is announced before it can be handled accordingly."

### US Mediterranean Fleet Mobilized Under Emergency Order from European Headquarters, Navy Department Says Unrelated to Holy Land Situation

[Our Dispatch] New York, 7th, broadcast: Seven US warships left Istanbul and Naples today for "routine" activities in the Mediterranean. The US Navy Department stated that this action by the US fleet is absolutely unrelated to the situation in Palestine.

[Reuters, London, 7th] US warships in Mediterranean ports such as Istanbul, Naples, and Villefranche, France, sailed 24 hours earlier than scheduled yesterday, heading towards a tea area in the Mediterranean. Those departing from Villefranche, France, included the 45,000-ton battleship "USS Missouri."

[Reuters, London, 6th] Powerful warships of the United States stationed in Mediterranean ports were suddenly summoned today to an undisclosed location, 72 hours before the expiration of the Palestinian truce. The cruisers "USS Fargo," "USS Huntington," and "USS Juneau," originally in Istanbul, set sail from Istanbul a day earlier today. Well-informed sources said this was due to the situation in Palestine. The cruiser "USS Kearsarge," a destroyer, and a supply ship also hurriedly left Naples a day earlier for an undisclosed location. Some crew members who were sightseeing in Rome did not make it back to the ship.

[United Press, Istanbul, 7th] US warships anchored here and in the port of Naples, Italy, suddenly left port yesterday after receiving emergency orders, destination unknown. Some said they were heading to Palestine, Trieste, and Crete, but opinions varied. According to well-informed sources, the US Navy believes that it is wiser for US warships to remain at sea, hence this decision. Others said that this was due to the serious breach of the Palestinian armistice agreement, and it may be necessary to evacuate nationals. However, the US Navy in Washington stated that the movement of these US warships is absolutely unrelated to the Palestinian issue. The aircraft carrier "USS Palau" arrived here not long ago and set sail for the eastern Mediterranean yesterday morning, followed by three cruisers of the Sixth Task Force. The three ships were originally scheduled to leave port on the 7th, but the fleet commander, Heumann, received several urgent telegrams from the commander of the US Atlantic Fleet in London yesterday and temporarily changed his plan. According to well-informed sources, they were heading to the waters near Crete to await developments. Four other US warships sailed south from Naples. Naval police entered the city late at night to search for US soldiers. It was reported that at least ten people were left behind and did not make it on board.

### Holy Land Fighting Erupts Again, Bernadotte's Chief of Staff Shot, French Truce Observer Dies of Gunshot Wounds

[Reuters, London, 7th] Today is the deadline set by Bernadotte for both the Jewish and Arab sides to respond to his proposed extension of the truce. Bernadotte will submit the responses of both sides to the Security Council for discussion. Reports of actions violating the truce order have been confirmed by Tel Aviv.

Colonel Pant, Bernadotte's Chief of Staff, was shot while negotiating a local truce near an Arab village twelve miles south of Haifa yesterday, apparently from Arab army positions. The Jewish side also stated that Iraqi troops and Arab guerrillas had fired on vehicles on Jewish roads, and Jewish armored vehicles immediately rushed to reinforce them. According to Lake Success: United Nations authorities announced that the United Nations truce observer, French Major Labourie, was shot and wounded while investigating truce violations twenty miles southeast of Haifa and died yesterday.

[United Press, Cairo, 7th] Jewish and Arab forces engaged in fierce fighting today along the main highway between Tel Aviv and Haifa, while UN mediator Bernadotte was making final efforts to extend the truce. Bernadotte declared here that if the proposal to extend the truce is rejected, consultations should continue. The highway fighting began last night on Israeli territory between Tira and Yeba, about ten miles north of Haifa. The telephone line between Tel Aviv and Haifa has been cut. Two US Marines driving a UN monitoring team truck were stopped by Arab forces, who opened fire on them for forty minutes before stopping after the US troops waved a white flag. American photojournalist McCluer drove from Tel Aviv to Haifa via back roads and was also shot at by Arab forces about twenty miles south of Haifa.

### Security Council Fails to Reach Agreement on Extending Holy Land Truce

Arabs and Jews Will Formally Respond

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 6th] While Bernadotte was telegraphed to extend the Holy Land truce, the entire Palestinian issue erupted into crisis again in the Security Council today. Although the issue was not on the agenda of the Security Council today, Bernadotte's telegram triggered a preliminary war of words in the meeting, with each member state holding different opinions. Britain and the United States strongly urged the Security Council to take swift measures to extend the Palestinian truce, which had only three days remaining, believing that this action should be taken immediately without debating the substantive issues of Arab-Jewish negotiations and Bernadotte's peace proposals. On the other hand, the Soviet Union and Ukraine believed that the decision to postpone could not be "reached alone," and therefore advocated a full debate on the entire Palestinian issue. Although the Soviet and Ukrainian sides did not oppose extending the truce, they intended to expose Bernadotte's peace proposals to the Security Council. Bernadotte's proposal advocates that the city of Jerusalem should be governed by Arabs rather than an international regime, and that the borders of Arab and Jewish countries should be greatly modified.

[Reuters, London, 6th] The Jews and Arabs have already rejected Bernadotte's Palestinian peace proposals, and the deadline for Bernadotte's proposal to extend the truce is also the 7th. If both sides reject it again, a meeting of the Security Council must be convened to consider appropriate action. Bernadotte flew from Tel Aviv to Cairo on the afternoon of the 6th to receive the Arab response to the extension of the truce. He is scheduled to go to Tel Aviv again on the 7th to receive the Jewish response. It is generally predicted that the Israeli government will accept the extension of the truce. However, the attitude of the Arabs is still in doubt.

[Reuters, London, 7th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said: Five British people were kidnapped by members of the Jewish Irgun group from the UN Truce Commission flag building in Jerusalem County. The British government attaches great importance to this matter and demands the immediate release of these five people. The spokesman did not reveal the names of the five people.

### Arab Representatives Withdraw from Security Council Venue

Protest Soviet Union's Indirect Recognition of Jewish State

[Our Dispatch] London, 7th, broadcast: Arab representatives withdrew from the Security Council meeting venue today to protest the Soviet Union's attempt to indirectly recognize the State of Israel. The Soviet and Ukrainian representatives referred to the Jewish representatives as representatives of the "State of Israel" during the meeting today, which is tantamount to recognizing the status of "Israel," which immediately aroused opposition from China, Britain, Syria, Belgium, and Canada, but because it did not reach a majority, it was not established.

### World Jewish Congress Closes

[United Press, Montreux, Switzerland, 6th] The Seventh World Jewish Congress closed this morning. Communist and anti-communist representatives argued over the organization of the Council and the Executive Committee without reaching a conclusion. Representatives from Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria refused to participate in the Council and the European Regional Executive Committee, therefore they were unable to participate in the Executive Committee of the American region.

### Support Eisenhower Group, Refuse to Give Up Nomination

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th, Associated Press] Many members of the US Democratic Party who support Eisenhower's candidacy for president have refused to give up their goal, even though Eisenhower has bluntly stated that he "cannot accept" the nomination. Most of his supporters do not believe that he will refuse to accept if the party's national conference nominates him next week.

### Bulganin Arrives in Berlin, Three Powers Protest, Await Soviet Response

[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] Sources close to the Soviet military government said that Marshal Bulganin, a member of the Soviet Politburo and Minister of the Armed Forces, has arrived in Berlin. Sokołowski's chief political advisor, Zhechev, has been recalled to Moscow and replaced by General Gribanov. In the past few months, Soviet politicians have frequently traveled between Berlin and Moscow. It has been rumored that the change of Sokołowski's political advisor is related to the reorganization of the Soviet military government in Germany.

[Reuters, London, 6th] Well-informed sources here believe that the notes that Britain, the United States, and France sent to the Soviet Union today are not in the nature of an ultimatum, nor do they suggest what steps the Western countries will take if the Soviet Union refuses to lift the blockade. Well-informed sources also believe that unless the Soviet Union gives a definite indication that it is prepared to break the deadlock, the Western countries do not intend to hold a four-power conference to re-discuss the German issue. The decision by the Western countries not to have the four-power military commanders in Germany engage in negotiations, but to have the four governments negotiate directly, has brought the Berlin dispute into a new and broader stage. According to a Washington dispatch, American diplomatic observers attach great importance to the fact that the Three Powers' Soviet note was delayed for several days to allow the Soviet Union a reasonable time to respond. It is expected that the note from the Three Powers has suggested some definite actions that the Soviet side should take. If the Soviet side ignores them, the Western powers will take decisive action.

### Soviet Warplanes Active in the Skies Over West Berlin

Britain and the United States Step Up Airlift of Food and Coal

[Our Dispatch] London, 7th, broadcast: A British transport plane supplying Berlin with food was surrounded by several Soviet aircraft today and deliberately rammed. The Soviet Union has warned the Allied side that if Allied aircraft linger outside the air corridor, they will be forced to land.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th, Associated Press] British and American aviators have been warned this evening that Soviet fighter planes are active near the air route between the Western Allies and Berlin. Therefore, British and American aviators need to fly above 5,000 feet and must fly within the air route. It is believed that this action by the Soviet side is a preliminary action to force the Western Allied aircraft to fly away from the existing air route.

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] British and American aircraft have stepped up the airlift from West Germany to Berlin. The amount of food delivered yesterday was over 1,000 tons. As food reserves are gradually increasing, several American four-engine aircraft have begun to be converted to carry coal.

### US Military Aid to Western European Alliance, Seven Countries Hold Preliminary Talks, Montgomery to Go to Paris Today to Meet with French Military Leaders

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] The seven-nation military talks began today in the State Department. These talks will prepare for direct US military support to the Western European Alliance. In addition to the United States and the five members of the Western European Union, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, there are also representatives from Canada participating in the talks. US officials said that this meeting may continue for several days, and several committees will be set up to deal with various issues separately, including the extent of US participation in the Western European Treaty, the method of equipping and supplying US troops to Western Europe, and the price that European countries will pay to the United States. The US representative participating in the talks is Undersecretary of State Lovett.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The State Department issued a statement after the meeting stating that participants had "informally exchanged views on issues of common interest related to the Senate's recommendation of June 11, 1948." The Senate's recommendation was drafted by Vandenberg.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] British Imperial Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery is scheduled to arrive here on Thursday to hold talks with French Army Chief of Staff Tassigny and other military leaders. He is scheduled to stay in Paris for four days.

### Berlin Currency War Troubles City Government Officials, Salaries Unpaid, Pockets Empty

[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] The Soviet military headquarters summoned the treasurer of the Berlin city government today and told him that from the mayor down, all city government officials cannot be paid their salaries until the political situation becomes clear. The city treasurer had previously requested the Soviet military government to allow him to withdraw 900 million marks from the bank for salaries and other expenses. According to the Soviet currency reform law, these deposits can be converted into East German new marks at the same value. July 1st was originally the day for paying salaries, but it has not been paid to this day due to currency reform, and most officials' pockets are empty. Political figures in West Berlin believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the city government to withdraw bank deposits is another measure to force this city government, which largely holds anti-communist views, to withdraw from the Soviet zone and move to the Western zone. The Soviet authorities also summoned Sol, the speaker of the Berlin city council, of the Social Democratic Party, this afternoon. He is scheduled to convene an emergency meeting of the city council on the 7th to discuss this new action by the Soviet authorities.

### Italian Government Plans to Draft Anti-Strike Bill, Preparing for a Showdown with the Communist Party

[Associated Press, Rome, 6th] As 300,000 chemical workers launch a strike, the Italian government considered the formulation of an anti-strike bill on the 6th and implemented a showdown with the Communist Party on labor issues. This is where the success or failure of the Marshall Plan lies, and also where the fate of Italy lies. At the same time, labor leaders said that if the series of strikes in the middle of this week still fail to achieve concessions from the capitalists, "we will take more serious measures after July 10th."

[Reuters, Lake Success, 7th] The Security Council passed a resolution proposed by China yesterday, instructing the United Nations Indonesia Mediation Committee to submit early reports on the restrictions on Indonesia's domestic and foreign trade and the reasons for not fulfilling Article 7 of the Armistice Agreement. After an hour and a half of heated debate, Chairman Mansky of Ukraine said that he would telegram the Mediation Committee to submit a report on the Dutch implementation of the blockade within five days, and announced the adjournment of the meeting by striking the table with a gavel. China, Britain, the United States, and Belgium protested one after another, expressing opposition to the use of the term blockade and the five-day deadline. Finally, the resolution proposed by China was passed.

The reason for the turmoil in Panama was that in the presidential election on May 9, opposition candidate Arias narrowly defeated government candidate Tello.

### Over a Hundred Transportation Workers Laid Off; Buses Stoppage Temporarily; Negotiation Continues Today After Petitioning Fails

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Public Utility Bureau's Public Transportation Company suddenly announced yesterday that 72 drivers from the 21st class and 125 ticket sellers from the 18th class would be placed on unpaid leave. In addition to petitioning the Social Bureau and the Public Utility Bureau for relief, the laid-off drivers and ticket sellers went to the intersection of Central West Road and Huashan Road, Jing'an Temple, and the Bund Central Park at 3:30 PM, blocking the operation of bus lines 3, 9, 10, 4, 11, 6, and 15, and expanding publicity to seek the sympathy of other employees. Upon hearing the news, Wang Zongshan, head of the Transportation Section, and Ding Weitang, deputy head, rushed to the major stopping stations to persuade them. Lines 4, 11, 6, and 15 soon resumed operation, and lines 9, 10, and 3 also resumed operation around 6:00 PM.

The Transportation Company recruited drivers and ticket sellers in Shanghai and Hangzhou on April 1st. On April 24th, the recruited workers received short-term training, and on May 5th, they were assigned to serve the traffic vehicles for the National Games, with a basic salary of 43 yuan, which was issued according to the workers' cost of living index. These drivers and ticket sellers originally had jobs, but because the company repeatedly assured them that they would not be suspended unless there were major mistakes or incurable diseases after serving, everyone resigned from their original jobs and settled down to work for the company. Unexpectedly, at about 3:00 PM yesterday, Wang Zongshan, head of the Transportation Section, suddenly announced the order of Zhao Jian, chairman of the committee, stating that due to sluggish business and difficulties in obtaining gasoline, drivers from number 1010 to number 1085 and ticket sellers from number 1050 to number 1179 would be placed on unpaid leave, each receiving half a month's salary, approximately 15 million yuan, and those returning to Hangzhou would receive a third-class train ticket. This order would take effect from the 8th. Upon hearing this news, the laid-off drivers and ticket sellers were shocked and protested loudly, saying that if there was no need to increase workers in the past, they should not have been recruited. If they were recruited, their jobs should be guaranteed and they should not be suspended casually. At a time when there are many unemployed people, it is a sudden announcement of suspension. With no preparation for a career change, life will be in panic, and they requested the authorities to withdraw the order. Wang, the section chief, immediately explained the company's difficulties, and said that this was a decision made by the higher authorities and could not be reversed. If the company's business recovers in the future, they will be given priority. Seeing that there was no result, the workers gathered more than a hundred people (not including the night shift and those scattered in various places), and took four buses to petition the Social Bureau.

Representatives Petition to Describe Suffering

The petitioning workers arrived at the Social Bureau at about 4:00 PM and sent four representatives to visit Director Wu, who was received by Section Chief Fan Zhenbang. According to the representatives, the company's sudden measures put the workers' lives in dire straits. The severance pay of 15 million yuan can only buy seven dou of rice, and finding a new job is extremely difficult. They also bitterly complained about the company authorities' divisive policies towards workers. A company of more than 3,000 workers still does not have a labor union. Section Chief Fan expressed his sympathy for the workers' situation, but said that the company belongs to the Public Utility Bureau, and if you have any suffering, you should first appeal to the Public Utility Bureau. He will report your petition to Director Wu, and Director Wu will discuss a proper solution with Director Zhao.

At about 5:00 PM, the petitioning drivers and ticket sellers decided on two measures in the square of the Social Bureau: (1) Gather the remaining 70 or 80 laid-off workers who have not arrived at the scene, and form a temporary committee to appeal to all relevant parties. (2) Petition Director Zhao of the Public Utility Bureau immediately. At 5:15 PM, the petitioning workers still took four buses to the Public Utility Bureau.

Request One Year of Severance Pay

When they arrived at the Public Utility Bureau, Director Zhao was holding a review meeting on electricity allocation with representatives of various electricity companies. More than 190 people gathered on the stairs and corridors and refused to leave, and wrote slogans everywhere with chalk, such as "We want to eat" and "Oppose unconditional layoffs." At 6:30 PM, Wang Zongshan, the section chief, and Ding Weitang, the deputy section chief, arrived one after another, lectured the workers, and persuaded them to return to the factory to talk. All the petitioning workers left the Public Utility Bureau at 7:05 PM and returned to the factory with Section Chief Wang, and sent representatives to negotiate with the company authorities. The workers demanded one year's severance pay per person if they were not allowed to continue working. This dispute had not been resolved until late at night, and negotiations will continue today.

Company Expresses Hardships of Layoffs

According to the company, the emotions of other workers are good and not affected at all, and vehicles on each line can operate normally today. It is said that this batch of field workers were recruited into the company in this city and Hangzhou on April 4, with ticket sellers from number 1050 to number 1179 (including five who voluntarily resigned midway) totaling 125 people, and drivers from number 1010 to number 1085 totaling 72 people, for a total of 197 people, who are the newest of all the company's employees. In the investigation report submitted by the Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Council, the Public Transportation Company was said to have too many employees, and the company authorities also believed that the business situation was not good and the income and expenditure could not be balanced, so there was this layoff of field employees. The company also has unavoidable difficulties. These workers have been trained by the company and are all excellent people. When the company's business improves in the future, they will still need to be recruited and reused. This temporary suspension is unpaid leave, which is different from dismissal.

### Taxi Fares Increase Again

The shipping industry adjusted freight rates by 80% on July 1st, which happened to be a time of severe price fluctuations, so even though it has only been a week, the expenditure side has risen by more than 100%.

On the 24th of last month, the ambassador celebrated his 72nd birthday in Pingdu, and returned to Beijing at the beginning of this month to sign the US-China Aid Bilateral Agreement. He came to Shanghai by night train yesterday (6th), so he specially invited leaders from all walks of life in the city to celebrate the ambassador's birthday, and only represented the citizens of the city to pay tribute to the ambassador, and wished Sino-US relations to last forever. Furthermore, today is the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day, and it is even more meaningful for us to gather together. After Pan finished his speech, Ambassador Stuart stood up and delivered a reply in Chinese, saying: What the speaker said about China being his second home is very correct. He asked himself, whether running a school or serving as an ambassador, the only purpose was to enhance Sino-US relations. Today, he can sincerely say on behalf of the American people and government that the only hope of the United States is to have a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic China, which is completely consistent with the efforts of your country's patriotic people. The ambassador finally expressed his sincere thanks to the speaker for the hospitality. The banquet ended at about 9:00 PM. Ambassador Kai has decided to go to Beijing this morning (8th).

[Our Newspaper] Director of the Finance Bureau, Tian Yongqian, hosted reporters from this city at the Municipal Bank Building at 7:00 PM last night, reporting that after the salaries of civil servants were adjusted monthly, the municipal finances had entered the most difficult stage. According to the income and expenditure report from January to June, the tax revenue can increase by about 30% on average each month, and the expenditure part is also calculated to increase by 30%. It is estimated that the income and expenditure offset each other. From July to December, the estimated loss for six months is close to 6 trillion yuan. Fortunately, the Council can deeply understand this, and during this meeting, the resolution was reviewed and resolved that the business tax rate in this city should be implemented according to the new tax law from the autumn of this year, and the bureau should be ordered to speed up the reporting and strictly spot check. Now, in order to increase the treasury revenue, the Finance Bureau has decided to strictly implement spot checks and has formulated spot check methods. The main points are as follows:

Main Points of Spot Check

(1) The bureau's future inspection methods should be based on the price index. If the report of a certain company in an industry is not in compliance, this company will be strictly investigated. If ten companies' reports are not truthful, ten companies will be strictly investigated. If an industry's report is not truthful, this industry will be given priority for spot checks, and chain accounting methods may be used to verify the truth. (2) Regarding the organization of the spot check personnel, those who are knowledgeable in commercial accounting, have high work efficiency, and are of honest integrity have been selected to go to various firms to conduct on-site strict inspections in groups, and senior officials have been assigned to supervise them in rotation. (3) If any firm makes a false declaration or forges account books in an attempt to evade taxes, it will be severely dealt with by the court once it is verified. (4) If any firm has not declared according to its actual turnover before the summer of this year, or has discovered after the declaration that there was a missed report in a certain quarter in the past, the bureau may still allow it to make a supplementary declaration or include it in the summer turnover of this year, and will not impose penalties leniently. (5) In the past, many firms did not pay attention to the reporting deadline stipulated by the bureau. In the future, in addition to strictly punishing the late reporting firms according to law, the bureau will also check their account books in advance to warn against cunning.

### Discovery at Jiaotong University: Communist Propaganda

Police Bureau Investigating

On the 2nd of this month, the Police Bureau received a confidential report stating that a large-scale communist propaganda piece titled "Letter from Exiled Students" was openly posted on the student union bulletin board opposite Wenzhi Hall at Jiaotong University. The letter was attributed to five individuals: Tan Xiyi, Yang Caicheng, Qiu Youan, Hu Zheng, and Zhang Gongwei, and its content distorted facts to propagate communist ideals. Upon receiving the report, the Police Bureau dispatched officers late at night to remove the poster. An investigation revealed that Tan and the other four individuals were all covert communist operatives assigned to Shanghai Jiaotong University. Tan, Yang, Qiu, and Hu were expelled by the university in August of the 36th year (1947), while Zhang Gongwei fled to communist-controlled areas on March 30th of last year (1948). The Police Bureau, considering the open posting of such a notice on the Jiaotong University student union bulletin board a clear violation of the Emergency Regulations for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China, has sent a letter to Jiaotong University to investigate who received the original letter, its current location, and who transcribed and posted it, in order to pursue the matter.

### Members of the Human Rights Protection Committee Visit Shanghai Prison; In "Loyalty" Cell Blocks, Inmates Display Different Demeanors

Prison Workshop Fully Equipped; Inmate Workers Appear Neat; Library and Counseling Room Established, Literacy Classes Offered, Transformation Education Provided

[Report from this Newspaper] Members of the Municipal Council's Human Rights Protection Committee, Qu Yue, Zhao Junhao, Chen Baotai, Zhou Feicheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Hou Jiyuan, along with Chief of General Affairs Section Bu Shenghua, Editor Li Benkuan, and several Chinese and foreign journalists, visited the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison yesterday afternoon. They were accompanied by Warden Kong Xianglin on a tour of the "Loyalty" cell blocks, dining hall, and workshops. The prison's interior gave a generally clean impression. The "Loyalty" cell blocks housed inmates convicted of treason and corruption. Two prisoners were confined to each cell. Some sat blankly, others read books, some used wooden boards as desks to practice calligraphy, and some faced the wall, unwilling to show their faces. The cell floors were wooden platforms raised about half a foot off the ground. Bedding, chamber pots, wooden boxes, books, food, and other items were scattered around, but some were arranged neatly.

Foreign Inmates Receive Better Treatment

Inmates eat two meals a day, with a ration of 18 liang of rice per day. The cell doors are opened once in the morning and once in the afternoon, allowing prisoners to walk or exercise in the corridor for an hour. The prison authorities aim to transform prisoners, selecting those with good conduct and adherence to prison rules to serve as cooks, cleaners, and perform other tasks. In the kitchen, winter melons and onions were piled up, ready to be cooked. Cylindrical machines were rotating in the laundry room. Many inmates were working in the carpentry, sewing, printing, typesetting, binding, leather shoe and sock making, and box making workshops. The finished products included boxes, tables, pottery, cheongsams, clothing, documents, forms, shoes, socks, and wooden boxes, all custom-made for external clients. The workshops were fully equipped. For example, the sewing workshop had more than 20 sewing machines, and the printing workshop had many large printing presses. The typesetting workshop had over 7,000 Chinese regular script lead characters. The working inmates appeared neat, resembling ordinary workers. In terms of education, the prison has a library, a counseling hall, and literacy classes. The education department is responsible for rotating and gathering inmates to provide transformation education. There are over 30 foreign prisoners in the foreign prison. Their cells are larger, their beds are canvas, and they eat bread. They receive better treatment than the Chinese prisoners but still express dissatisfaction with the food. The women's prison was not visited yesterday due to time constraints.

Appeal for Assistance in Adding Doorways

After guiding the visitors through the prison, Warden Kong discussed one matter with the councilors. The prison currently only has five doorways for family visits. Only five people can visit their families at the same time. However, there are over 5,000 inmates. Each inmate is allowed two family visits per month, meaning an average of 300 inmates need to use these five doorways each day. Due to the large number of people, the conversation time for each visit has to be shortened, causing great pain to both the inmates and their families. The prison originally planned to expand to twelve doorways, but the funding was not approved by higher authorities, preventing the plan from being realized. He hoped that enthusiastic members of society could assist in solving the problem.

### Water Transportation Resumes; Hangli Escapes Danger and Returns; Passengers Experienced Scare on Chongming Island While Sheltering from the Storm

[Report from this Newspaper] After the typhoon passed, the weather cleared yesterday, and water transportation resumed. The Jiangya steamer sailed to Ningbo at 4:30 pm yesterday. The Jiangjing steamer has sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai and is expected to arrive as usual today. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang freighter is also expected to arrive today. The American-owned Hales, carrying 15,000 tons of diesel from Mexico, encountered severe wind and rain on the day before yesterday and sailed to Tongsha. Because the pilot could not board the ship in time, the captain assumed the role of harbor pilot. The ship ran aground after sailing less than a mile. Fortunately, it escaped danger when the tide rose. After the pilot boarded the ship yesterday morning, it arrived safely in Shanghai and is currently unloading at the petroleum company's wharf. The Yixiang Company's Fuyu freighter was blown to the Puxi shore by the hurricane on the day before yesterday and ran aground. It was towed out of danger yesterday morning and is still berthed at buoys 11 and 12, loading cargo for Guangzhou. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ruixin freighter, berthed at buoys 35 and 36, also ran aground due to the wind on the day before yesterday. It was towed out yesterday afternoon and is still berthed at the original buoy. Many other American freighters that ran aground or broke their cables due to the wind on the day before yesterday have all returned to normal. The Zhonghang Company's Hangli freighter, returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, carrying over 300 passengers, encountered the typhoon and was blocked from proceeding at the Shizilin section of the Yangtze River near Baoshan. The situation was critical. At noon, an urgent telegram for help was sent. After receiving the telegram, the company tried to find a solution, dispatching ships to rescue the freighter, but was unable to do so due to the severe wind and rain. Fortunately, the captain of the freighter was alert and slowly sailed to Chongming Island across the river to take shelter in Baozhen. The passengers were brought ashore. According to company sources yesterday, the passengers and crew are safe and sound and will return to Shanghai on the original ship this morning. The Datong-Dada Joint Venture's Jiangkang freighter, which sheltered from the wind in Hong Kong the day before yesterday, did not depart. It set sail last night and will arrive in Shanghai this morning, and will sail to Nantong that evening.

Seven Barge Accidents on the River

[Report from this Newspaper] The typhoon wreaked havoc in Shanghai, causing heavy losses on land and sea. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the families affected in the Huangpu River have reported a total of seven incidents to the Water Police Bureau yesterday: (1) Chen Renfu entrusted Zhou Fuji Transportation Company's barge No. 88689 to transport 450 bags of Xianqing thread to the No. 7 wharf of the China Merchants Bureau to be loaded onto the Deng steamer. Unexpectedly, it capsized due to the wind, and the goods were lost. (2) The Minyi Property Insurance Company, on behalf of Dacheng Textile Company, lost 250 pieces of raw cotton cloth and 250 pieces of Butterfly brand fine cloth, totaling 10,000 bolts, when the barge carrying the goods sank in the wind, resulting in a loss of 300 billion yuan. (3) Nanrongji Customs Brokerage transported 60 pieces of various cotton yarns and 79 pieces of cloth, loaded on the Yan barge for unloading onto the Fuyu freighter. Unfortunately, it also encountered an accident. (4) Nanrongji's barges Nos. 12345 and 12024, carrying 500 bags of bran, sank at the No. 7 wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. (5) China Travel Service transported over 100 pieces of cotton yarn on behalf of Anda Textile Factory, loaded on barges Nos. 22465 and 12099. All of them were lost. (6) Daxinlong Customs Brokerage's barge No. 31879, carrying 70 pieces of cotton yarn and 7 boxes of Dragon Head fine cloth, also encountered an accident. (7) Taikoo Chang Gongji Customs Brokerage lost 8 pieces of bleached cloth, totaling 200 bags, loaded on a barge at the Pudong Huazhan wharf.

It is reported that the following items have been recovered: 11 pieces of various cotton yarns, 23 bundles of scattered cotton yarns, 6 pieces and 5 bolts of white cloth, 7 boxes of soap, 20 pieces of books, and 49 bags of flour. Employees of Ewo Mill also recovered 8 pieces of cotton yarn, 1 box of soap, and 2 boxes of textbooks, and have notified the Water Police Bureau for verification.

### Western Film Negotiations to Reopen; Cinemas Dissatisfied with Low-Price Policy; Collaboration with Domestic Film Merchants Unlikely

[Report from this Newspaper] The triple dispute among the city's cinema operators, Western film merchants, and domestic film merchants, caused by the suspension of new film supply, has become increasingly deadlocked since the unsuccessful negotiations at the Social Affairs Bureau a few days ago. The Social Affairs Bureau originally convened the three parties to mediate and restore the normal film supply relationship as soon as possible. However, due to mutual accusations and inability to reach a consensus, the meeting ended on an unpleasant note. Luo Xuelian, a representative of the domestic film merchants, believes that the film industry is a powerful tool for educating the public and therefore emphasized that ticket prices should be as affordable as possible. The cinema operators argued that the current low ticket prices of second, third, and fourth-run cinemas are already promoting accessibility. However, first-run theaters are affected by actual expenses, so ticket prices at all levels cannot but be slightly higher. They ultimately proposed two reasons to request that the price limit for certain seats be adjusted to 250,000 yuan: (1) The price limit for first-run theaters is too low, almost the same as the selling price of second, third, and fourth-run cinemas, which threatens their survival and may cause further complications. (2) The difference between the price limit and the self-determined ticket price is too large, and the number of seats is limited, so the black market will inevitably flourish, and the audience will still be affected. However, this request was rejected by the Social Affairs Bureau. According to the Cinema Operators Association, they initially resolutely terminated their contract with the Western film merchants, hoping to cooperate with the domestic film merchants. However, the domestic film merchants only sought to seize superior cinemas to consolidate their own territory, disregarding the survival conditions of various cinemas. They expressed particular dissatisfaction with Luo Xuelian's personal opinion advocating a low-price policy, ignoring the interests of cinema operators. Therefore, the first-run cinemas are currently discussing abandoning their previous decision and formally reopening negotiations with Western film merchants. The only prerequisite for the negotiations is to raise the selling price. Except for the 30% of seats with a price limit that cannot be adjusted temporarily, they plan to adjust the prices of other tickets that the authorities allow to be freely increased to a minimum of 500,000 yuan and a maximum of 1 million yuan. If this approach is implemented within days, the problem of Western film supply can be smoothly resolved. However, the lines for purchasing limited-price film tickets will become even more crowded, and the "scalpers" who manipulate the limited-price tickets will become even more active.

### Bloody Shadow Over Kaifeng

—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Ling Songshou

[Dispatch from Kaifeng from This Newspaper, 1st Day of the Month] On June 16th, the 3rd, 8th, and 13th columns of the communist Chen Yi's forces, in coordination with the 1st column of the Liu Bocheng forces, fired the first shot outside the southern dike of Kaifeng, after capturing Chenliu. A storm began to descend on this ancient city by the Yellow River.

The fighting began on the southeast and south sides of the dike. On the 16th, the attacking communist forces were only a small number of advance troops. On the 17th, the main force of the communists in the Chenliu-Tongxu area gradually moved north. The east and west train stations of Kaifeng—Xinglong and Xinghuaying—fell. More than 60,000 communists gradually pressed towards Kaifeng. Chairman Liu Mao'en and Commander Li Zhongxin of the 66th Division decided to concentrate their forces and voluntarily abandoned the dike and the airfield, deploying strong defensive lines at important strongholds on the southeast side of the city, such as the Postal Administration, the China Public School, and the Yuwangtai. At this time, the

Kaifeng Garrison

consisted of the three regiments of the 13th Brigade of the 66th Division and the units directly under the division and brigade, plus the 1st and 2nd Security Regiments and the 5th and 6th Security Regiments. On the afternoon of the 17th, two regiments of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division, reinforcements retreating from Kaocheng in the west, arrived in Kaifeng after being attacked by the communists along the way. Only one regiment arrived in Kaifeng, serving as a reserve for the garrison of the East Gate. The brigade headquarters and the other regiment were cut off outside the city by the communists and could not enter. With such a small garrison, the defensive deployment of Kaifeng was as follows: the 37th and 39th Regiments of the 13th Brigade guarded the north and east city walls, respectively. The 5th Security Regiment garrisoned the West Gate. The 1st Security Brigade (only one regiment) was stationed at Songmen. The 2nd Security Brigade and the 6th Security Regiment were stationed at the Postal Administration, a major stronghold in the South Gate, and the 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade guarded the China Public School and Yuwangtai outside the Xiaonanmen (Small South Gate). At one o'clock in the morning on the 18th, the battle for Kaifeng officially began. The communists attacked the east and west gates and the South Gate in three directions. The angry fire of our defenders was unleashed with rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades. In the wind and sand on the edge of the ancient city, under the dim moonlight, the attacking communist soldiers fell one by one. At the East (i.e., Caomen), Southwest, and West Gates, the communist casualties were at least one battalion. Of course, the communists would not give up. After nightfall, they again attacked the Songmen position of our 1st Security Brigade with their main force, and harassed the northwest corner of Kaifeng with a part of their force, in order to contain the 39th Regiment of the East Gate garrison. The sound of artillery and machine guns echoed throughout the night. After one o'clock on the 19th, about one battalion of communists broke into Songmen but was quickly annihilated by our defenders. At around three o'clock, more than 500 communists, under the cover of intense artillery fire, again approached the southeast corner of the city wall within about 500 meters, attempting to break in, but were again annihilated by our intense fire.

From dark to dawn, from daybreak to dusk, the sound of gunfire never stopped. Our air force also

circled above Kaifeng

day and night, constantly coordinating with ground forces and destroying enemy positions behind the lines. However, these measures could not stop the communists' cannibalistic intentions. At 2:50 p.m. on the 19th, the communists finally broke through Xiaonanmen and advanced towards the city center. However, along every street and on every building, the National Army had long prepared strong street fighting fortifications. In order to defend Kaifeng, our small number of heroic defenders strengthened the pressure, forcing the communists to retreat to the southeast corner. As the battle evolved to this stage, God had already decided the fate of Kaifeng and its people. Because the communist forces concentrated their firepower on our city's southern positions, the Postal Administration building caught fire, and the 2nd Security Brigade and the 6th Security Regiment suffered heavy casualties. Therefore, they retreated into the city and continued to engage in fierce street fighting with the communists who had entered the city in every bunker.

The remaining communists, pressed into the southeast corner of the city, took advantage of the cover of artillery fire and again harassed the city center. At midnight, the West Gate was also broken through by the communists, and the defense of the provincial government began.

Chairman Liu Mao'en was directing the defense of Kaifeng. He had not slept for four days and nights (although he usually only slept four hours a day). When the communists' bullets began to be fired at the provincial government, his staff had long urged him to break out, but he refused. He said that for Kaifeng, he should hold on to the last moment.

As in the past few days, the sound of gunfire echoed day and night, but even more fiercely. By dawn on the 20th, the

provincial government stronghold

remained standing firm, but its surroundings had been littered with countless bodies sacrificed in its defense.

In the afternoon of the 20th, the communists began to fire sulfur bombs at the provincial government. The communists' flames spread to every building of the provincial government, and the provincial government became a sea of fire! At the same time, the communists sent raiding troops around to the north side of the provincial government, launching a sneak attack from Chairman Liu's office. In this narrow alley, attacks and counterattacks occurred more than 20 times in a few hours. Here, machine guns and rifles had lost their effectiveness. The only weapons that could be used were hand grenades. In order to seize this stronghold, the communists sacrificed the main force of two more battalions. After nightfall on the 20th, Chairman Liu Mao'en and several guards, as well as Captain Xie of the cadre training class of the 5th Army, and a certain company commander, entered the basement. He saw that the situation could not be salvaged and wanted to commit suicide several times, but he did not have a weapon with him. At the same time, he was monitored by the people around him. The situation became increasingly tense. The people around Chairman Liu repeatedly urged him to break out, but Chairman Liu refused to agree. When his third brother, Liu Zhenbi, gave him advice, he kicked Liu Zhenbi away in anger, contrary to his usual respectful attitude, and shouted, "What do you know?" At the worst at two o'clock on the 21st, the provincial government stronghold could no longer be held. Therefore, Captain Wei and several others, regardless of his willingness, picked him up and ran, passed through the alleys, climbed over the corpses, and exited the city from the southwest corner. Of course, the Liu family had struggled in Henan for two years to maintain a situation that was difficult to sustain. For the future of Henan, for the 30 million people of Henan, he could not die.

On the morning of the 21st, the steel and concrete provincial government had been reduced to ashes. The remaining defenders, in a situation where they could no longer defend, were liquidated! At this time, the communists

broke through the North Gate

and launched a fierce attack on Longting, where Commander Li Zhongxin's command post was located. Our troops defending Henan University concentrated and solidified their defense at a certain stronghold on the north city wall (northwest of Longting).

Longting is tens of feet high, with water on its left and right fronts and an open area behind it, making it a good stronghold in terms of terrain. During the day, our air force constantly blocked the small road leading from the front of Longting to the city center with machine guns. At the same time, our troops behind Longting also combined machine guns with a bunker in the northwest corner of the city to form a network of fire, making it impossible for the communists to approach. However, this was only doing one's best and waiting for fate. The communists had invaded Kaifeng. Could they give up now that only one stronghold remained? In the evening, the communists fired a dense barrage of artillery at Longting and constantly launched human wave attacks. At around 11 o'clock, the remaining defenders on Longting were either wounded or dead, and their ammunition was exhausted. Longting fell without the need for a fierce attack by the communists. At the same time, Commander Li Zhongxin committed suicide in the bunker north of the city. The few remaining defenders fought hard until about 9 a.m. on the 22nd and were finally eliminated. Kaifeng, which had been in a fierce battle for seven days, thus fell into communist hands.

### Woodcarvings from Two Thousand Years Ago

— Jiang Xuanyi

Records of Antiquities Unearthed in Changsha (2)

[Dispatch from Changsha from This Newspaper, 1st Day of the Month] Among the wooden artifacts unearthed in Changsha, the most valuable for research are the idols with protruding eyes and protruding tongues. These idols come from wooden coffers in large wooden outer coffin tombs. The wooden coffers are about the size of coffins. The idols all have wooden seats. In front of the idols were arranged one zither, several feather-cups, and several pieces of pottery and wooden figurines. These statues have horns on their heads. The horns are made of antlers or deer horns, some complete, some destroyed at the time of excavation. More than ten of these idols were unearthed (one in each tomb). The most complete ones have all flowed to the United States. Americans call them "bobcats," and Chinese call them "Fangxiang." However, Fangxiang is a servant who wears a ghost mask to drive away ghosts. These idols are objects of worship in tombs. Although their shapes are similar, they should not be confused. They should be studied in terms of their purpose. The indigenous people of Taiwan have horned idols, and Bali has tongue-protruding witch doctors. Studying these customs can reveal that ancient southern customs were the same as those of the Pacific Islands. Based on the fact that they were worshipped, they can be called a kind of totem, or the "Shezhu" of ancient Chinese books, the wooden memorial tablets of modern villagers. Other items include boxes for storing swords, boxes for storing holidays items, large tigers carrying bells and drums, wooden spears, wooden swords, and so on.

The wooden figurines

are three feet seven or eight inches long, both male and female. Some have movable hands and feet, and their muscles are fully exposed. It is truly a miracle that carvings from the late Zhou Dynasty could be discovered in the damp soil of the south. I have been studying sculpture for more than 20 years and have written a book on the history of sculpture. I believe that the earliest Chinese sculpture dates back to the Han Dynasty. Therefore, when I saw the Chu wooden carvings in Changsha, I was almost dumbfounded. In Chinese museums, the Yu tripod and the Tang basin are common sights, but even fine sculptures from the Six Dynasties are extremely rare. As for wooden carvings from the late Zhou Dynasty, they are unheard of.

Lacquerware

includes boxes for storing bronze mirrors and combs. The boxes are cylindrical, with lids, or divided into three tiers, with three small boxes in the lower tier. Silver or bronze bells were used on the rims of the lacquer boxes (called "Kouqi" in the Han Dynasty), with bronze feet attached below, and the middle was decorated with animal-face rings (the broken bronze bottom in the museum is this). The entire body is covered with thick lacquer, and figures, patterns, and animals are painted on the lacquer, or patterns are engraved with needles, as fine as silk threads, with infinite variations. There are occasional seal characters on the bottom, such as "25th Year," etc.

The use of lacquer seems to have been very common at that time. One of the idols mentioned above was not only lacquered but also painted with flowers all over its body. Although the scabbard was wooden, the black lacquer shone brightly and was as thick as cloth. The box for storing holiday items contained three rolls of lacquer skin, which were even thicker than leather. There were also large pottery

cauldrons and jars

whose exteriors were also coated with stone-like lacquer that shone brightly, with colorful light grass painted on them. The top of the coffin was also thickly lacquered, with patterns as complex as those of Dunhuang murals, but even the United States does not have this kind of painted coffin, let alone Chinese collectors. I still feel sad about the loss of the lid of this painted coffin.

In addition to the lacquer items mentioned above, the most numerous

lacquer plates

and lacquer feather-cups were the most numerous. At least 60 lacquer plates and 300 feather-cups were unearthed, but only about one-tenth of them were complete and could be preserved. This is because the lacquerware was in good condition when it was unearthed, but after half a year in the sealed protective boxes, it would crack and become unusable. If this were a planned excavation, with photos and rubbings taken immediately after excavation, the beauty of the Chu clan's patterns would be enough to amaze the world. Other items, such as lacquered tables and lacquered military clothing, are also very beautiful, but unfortunately, there are too few of them.

### Grain Prices Have Started to Fall as Speculators Fear Investigation of Warehouses

Yesterday, the rice market saw tight credit, and customers wanted to sell. Furthermore, the inspection of warehouses has led to panic selling among speculators, resulting in a surge in supply. The market opened steadily but declined later in the day. High-quality white japonica rice and high-quality thin indica rice both fell to 21 million [currency units], a decrease of 1 million compared to the previous day. The market quotation remains at 20 million, but the quality has improved. Yesterday's arrivals at the North and South markets totaled 5,818 shi.

Flour prices are undetermined, pending a meeting of manufacturers this afternoon. Market trading remains suspended. Old Army and troopship flour prices outside the market are 6.65 million. The market is very firm due to high wheat and tin prices. Bran is 4.5 million, small bags are 3.5 million, and wheat factory bids reached 9 million.

Grains

Grains are generally rising because prices were not fully adjusted after trading resumed yesterday. Therefore, sellers are holding firm on higher prices. Soybean prices, combined with soybean cake and oil prices, are too low, so they rose by 1 million yesterday. Merchants from Hankou offered nearly 6,000 bags of Zhada soybeans at 10 million, which were mostly bought by oil factories. Corn rose by 200,000 to 300,000, broad beans rose by 100,000, and mung beans, sesame seeds, and raw kernels, which had not risen enough previously, increased more in price yesterday. Mung beans rose by 1 million to 2 million, sesame seeds rose by 2 million to 3 million, and raw kernels rose by 4 million to 5 million.

Cooking Oil

Prices are generally lower than the price ceiling because of tight credit and increased buying and selling. Dayou soybean oil opened at 44.45 million and closed at 43.8 million. Changde soybean oil was 42 million. Rapeseed oil was lower by 1 million, trading at 42 million. When the price of raw oil was set, pure raw oil was traded off the books. Small-batch sesame oil fell by 1.5 million, and soybean cake softened in the afternoon, falling by 100,000.

### Market Controls Loosen, Future of Chinese Stocks Uncertain

Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw a slight relaxation of controls in various markets outside of the industry. Interest from speculative funds began to diversify, and there was a trend of selling after prices rose. The limit-up of Qinxing and Jinglun, and the limit-down of Match and Xinhua, created a mixed picture, making the future uncertain. After consecutive gains, a peak followed by decline is feared.

At the start of the morning, people were wary after consecutive gains. The market opened with more declines than gains. Yongsha started at 6,850 yuan, with bids for 89, 154, 176, 54, 65, 225, 89, 104, 218, and 98, rising to a new high of 7,190. Qinxing and Jinglun announced limit-up, and Guang merchants 202 and 155, as well as major investors 152, 203, 145, 95, 230, and 122, and bank group 220 strongly sold off. The last commission fee was still at the original price, falling back to 6,820 yuan. The controls on yarn and cloth have been relaxed, inevitably leading to some diversification. 176, 95, 89, 85, and 116 were maintained, once recovering to 7,100 yuan, but ultimately, due to an influx of stock, 203, 184, 169, 164, 219, 180, and 89 came to settle again, and Match even reported limit-down. The noon closing fell to 6,850 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, Jinglun, Qinxing, Nei Yi, and Hengfeng rose by 5% to 10%, while Guohuo, Shangwu, Zhabei, Jingfu, Datong, Rongfeng, Match, and Zhongsi fell by 5% to 10%, and the rest saw mixed gains and losses.

In the afternoon, Yongsha first rose to 7,150 yuan, then fell back to 7,020 yuan. 206, 18, 179, 180, 106, 3, 8, 176, and 54 then advanced to a new record of 7,260 yuan. Jinglun and Qinxing rose to the limit, and Guang merchants 202 and major investors 117, 95, 61, and 131 settled, gradually moving downstream, falling to 6,950 yuan. Match and Xinhua reacted by hitting limit-down. Guohang saw little progress and entered a sideways trend, closing at 7,000 yuan. Compared to the latest closing, Jinglun and Datong hit limit-up, Xinhua and Match hit limit-down, Shangwu, Qinxing, and Guohuo were flat, Yonggong and Zhabei rose by 5%, Huaxin fell by 5%, and the rest saw minor changes. In the off-market trading of unlisted stocks, Dasheng and Shijie rose by 10%, becoming profitable, while the rest were flat.

Government Bonds

The rally intensified yesterday. Unified C opened at 980,000, peaking at 1,040,000, then leveling off slightly. Rooms 360 and 5012 sold off, while rooms 552 and 500 bought. The transaction volume was only 3 million, with A, B, and E each rising by 100,000 compared to the previous closing, C rising by 150,000, and D rising by 110,000.

### National Bank Strengthens Sales Efforts, Establishes Committee for Overall Management

Liu Gongyun Responsible for Summoning

### Seventh Season Import Quotas to Be Significantly Reduced

[Report from this Newspaper] It is learned that the quantities of the seventh season import quotas will be greatly reduced. Items such as raw cotton, production equipment, and medicines will be completely eliminated. Moreover, since the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement certificate system, export conditions have not been as good as expected, and the Treasury's foreign exchange position is short. In the future, the foreign exchange required for imports will be paid entirely from foreign exchange earned from exports. Therefore, the quantities of other items in the seventh season import quota, even those that do not overlap with US aid materials, will also be reduced.

### Tea Market Footing Solid

Yesterday, the tea market saw more buyers inquire due to the improved weather. Sellers emphasized the rising production prices and the difficulty in lowering the cost of reprocessing, maintaining a bullish attitude. By the close of the market, negotiations were difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion, and most transactions remained stalled. Prices remained as before, indicating a solid foundation. It is learned that local exporters have repeatedly received telegrams from North Africa in recent days, stating that there is a significant demand for green teas this year. However, the prices offered are stingy, making it difficult to expand in the short term.

The second task was to stabilize prices, with measures still including the sale of yarn, cloth, and other materials to contract currency. The third task was to discuss the supply of military cloth, which cannot be disclosed due to national defense secrets. The fourth task was to seek guidance on the future work direction of the Yarn Control Committee.

After reviewing all the rosters one by one, it was decided to divide the teams into three groups – A, B, and C – based on their strength. Group A has fourteen teams, Group B has twenty teams, and Group C has thirty-nine teams, divided into two sections, C1 and C2. Section C1 has twenty teams, and Section C2 has nineteen teams. All competitions will adopt a single round-robin system. Detailed rosters of each team participating in the competition have been printed and will be sent to each team before the competition. Furthermore, the competition time is set at 6:30 PM for the first match and 8:00 PM for the second match. Teams that are late will be considered to have forfeited. Teams that forfeit twice will be disqualified. The authorities hope that all those who lend out table tennis rooms will quickly strengthen the lighting (limited to 150 lux or more) and ensure that the table tennis tables meet standard dimensions to facilitate the competition. The rosters of each group are listed below:

### Regarding Free Tuberculosis X-Ray Checkups: Our Contribution of Opinions to Reporters

If there is any suspicion about chest health, an application for a checkup should be submitted immediately.

In order to raise the awareness of tuberculosis among the people of our country, our newspaper began to organize free tuberculosis X-ray checkups starting last summer. Our original intention was not to completely eradicate tuberculosis, this invisible killer, because "checkups" themselves are a passive thing. However, we wanted to make sure that the health conditions of the lungs of every reader who applied for a checkup were fully revealed, so that they could receive preventive and treatment opportunities in a timely manner. Last year's tuberculosis checkup started in early May and ended at the end of July, with eleven cooperating hospitals. This year, in order to promote this movement more widely, the cooperating hospitals, in addition to the eleven hospitals that participated last year, have added the Municipal Third Hospital, Zhongxi Recuperation, China Recuperation, and Heping Civilian Hospital, for a total of fifteen hospitals. This makes our service area almost cover the entire city of Shanghai.

From June 21st to today, the number of readers who have applied for checkups has reached more than two thousand. Among them, except for those with incomplete procedures who are temporarily not being processed, all have been issued free checkup coupons and assigned to hospitals near the applicants for their checkups. Counting from today, there are still a full fifteen days left until the end of the one-month deadline. There are still more than one thousand places available for checkups. We hope that our readers will actively apply to participate. This time, fifteen hospitals, including Zhongshan, are cooperating with us and sacrificing their valuable medical time to serve readers with enthusiasm, which deserves our gratitude and praise.

According to current prices, the cost of an X-ray checkup ranges from one million to two million yuan. Assuming that the number of checkups is three thousand, the consultation fees sacrificed by the fifteen hospitals are a huge sum of forty to fifty billion yuan. Dear readers, in tomorrow's column, you will see our published "Fifth Application Form." If you suspect that your lungs are unhealthy, please follow the application procedures. In the past, many applicants did not include a self-addressed stamped envelope or did not include return postage. Because of the regulations, it was impossible to process their applications. Now, please re-apply or complete the procedures so that we can mail the checkup coupons.

### On Tradition

— Ji Yong

Recently, there have been many people criticizing traditional Chinese thought. Most things are opposed, and it's no wonder. Everyone has unspeakable pain and always wants to find the root cause of the disease. This makes the ancients suffer. It's like a child falling down and blaming the door sill. It's inevitable to curse it, even spit on it a couple of times, and stomp on it. After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, there was such a period. Mr. Wu Yu, who single-handedly attacked the Confucian shop, and Lin Yutang, who greatly ridiculed Confucius with "Zi Jian Nanzi," both had their moment in the spotlight, but Confucius is still Confucius. Saying that he has too much social influence is certainly true, but old things are not entirely garbage, and they are still useful in some ways. It is right that they should not be completely erased.

Originally, discussing the ancients is very difficult. Zhuangzi's saying, "You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of fish?" is a famous saying that cannot be discounted. In reasoning about ancient society and thought, no matter what, we cannot avoid today's subjective filtering effect, that is, the benevolent and the wise each see differently. Confucius and Mencius in those days were not "three heads and six arms" (as Tang Yongtong said), and they were desperately trying their luck. – Because of this, some people say that Confucianism is desperate to be officials, obsessed with officialdom, which is indeed true; but Mozi's advocacy everywhere, and his disciples also holding office in various countries, and the enthusiasm of Legalists and strategists, is even more intense than that of Confucianism. How can we say that? We cannot think that Confucius was born an idol. Idols are created by those who use him, deliberately making him look like this. What does that have to do with Confucius? If we say that Confucius' disciples specialized in flattering officials, then in the time of Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty, there were Zha Liang and Ning Yuan, who preferred to study etiquette in the Confucian forest rather than follow Shusun Tong to be a jester; there were many flattering officials and sycophants in various dynasties, but there were also many remonstrating officials and outspoken scholars. Qian Muzhai went to welcome the new master outside Yifengmen, while Shi Kefa died for the country in Yangzhou, and Huang Lizhou and Zhang Cangshui, how did they not talk about Neo-Confucianism? Even Wang Yangming and Gu Yanwu deeply hated it, thinking it was the main reason for the fall of the country. In fact, Yaojiang was both a literary and political figure, capable in both war and peace. How could he be compared to those who idly stood by and died in times of crisis? If we want to draw conclusions from these sporadic phenomena, unless we adopt American-style statistical methods, use scientific comparison, and decide on the majority percentage, we need to analyze all twenty-five histories. However, this raises another question, which is the standard of good and evil. Human mental activity is the most difficult thing to regulate, so the so-called moral concepts cannot be accurate for all seas and passed down for a hundred generations. For example, in history, there have been many views on Zhang Xianzhong, Li Zicheng, Huang Chao, and Hong Xiuquan in the past fifty years, and with them come the merits and demerits of Zeng Guofan, Hu Linyi, Zuo Zongtang, and Li Hongzhang; so, even if we want to study a family or a social group as meticulously as the Americans, it is still difficult to do so! Moreover, Chinese people especially like to write "Wu Zixu was not a filial son" and "Yue Fei was not a loyal minister" types of revisionist articles.

Confucius also told his disciples: "Be a Confucian gentleman, do not be a petty Confucian," and "The virtuous recognize the great, the unworthy recognize the small." This means that even if the Tao is one foot high, the devil can be ten feet high. In the mouth of a petty Confucian disciple, Confucius is inevitably trivial and unbearable. Just look at how much Mencius quoted Confucius' words, taking only what he needed. Mencius was certainly not a petty Confucian, but the fact that various doctrines can be interpreted at will is very clear. If we say that Chinese tradition contains Confucius' thought, it is certainly true, but if we say that it is purely Confucius' thought, and put all the blame on Confucius, and even trace back his private life and actions, none of which are sufficient to influence future generations in a confusing way, then I cannot but speak up for Confucius. An orange tree planted south of the Huai River becomes a pomelo, and planted north of the Huai River becomes a trifoliate orange, which is a very clear metaphor. Confucianism has undergone countless transformations, mixtures, and distortions to this day; Dong Zhongshu wanted to dismiss the hundred schools of thought, which inherited Mencius' tradition of resisting heretical words and spreading evil theories, and met the political needs of the great unification of the Han Dynasty. Is this Confucius' doing? In the Analects, there are very few instances of scolding people so harshly. The reason why Mencius did so was probably due to political struggle; as for the empty and superficial Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties, that was a trick of Indian philosophy. Confucius never talked about things like mind, nature, principle, or subtle and profound things! To be honest, the thought at that time was not advanced enough to be so systematic and organized, so the book of the Analects is full of trivialities and the commonness of daily life, just as Confucius himself said: "If you cannot serve people, how can you serve ghosts?" The source of the scholar-official class is not entirely due to Confucius alone. There is no giant in the world who can create a class by himself; the main thing is the progress of production, and humans have the leisure to seek knowledge and develop their intellect, so there are more and more people who do not make a living by production. Confucius was certainly one, but what about Mozi, Han Fei, Zhuang Zhou, Lao Tzu, Guan Zhong, Shang Yang, and Gongsun Yang? Class concepts and characteristics become deeper and deeper, and eventually become clearly opposed; coupled with external troubles, wars, natural disasters, and other factors, everyone falls into poverty, and thus gradually uses class power to fight for interests and benefits, and become greedy for their own gain. The more this happens, the more uneasy people become, and this trend cannot be curbed. The worsening of this trend further contributes to social unrest, a cyclical effect that is truly terrifying. Perhaps these things were not foreseen by Confucius two thousand years ago?

### Giving Gifts

— Suo Bei

A year ago, holding a wedding reception with refreshments would generally not result in a loss. The income and expenses of the day would not only offset each other, but there would also be a surplus; but now it is not the case.

The reason is extremely simple: A year ago, the "price" of gifts was generally between 40,000 and 100,000 yuan; at 40,000 yuan, you could buy two packs of American cigarettes. As long as two guests gave 40,000 yuan, you could supply all the guests with cigarettes; but what about now? Gifts of 1 million are more common. You can't even buy two packs of San Paotai.

Of course, the gift-givers know that a sum of 1 million is very meager, but if you say 2 million, then for the average salaried person, if there are three social obligations in a month, that would be 6 million, which is inevitably felt to be beyond their means; let's give a discount and give 1.5 million, but this amount seems too incomplete.

If we take 100,000 yuan a year ago as the standard, at that time you could buy one dan of white rice; then those who used to give 100,000 yuan should now give at least 20 million (today the retail price of rice has reached 23.4 million), but in fact, it is rare to see gifts of 10 million at wedding receptions today, except for a few wealthy families.

Therefore, recently, every time I have to give a wedding gift, it always makes me hesitate for a long time, consider again and again. As a result, I have the will but not the strength. After sealing a red envelope, I shamefully write my name, and then shamefully run to the wedding reception, hurriedly drop it off at the accounting office, sign my name at the registration place, and then sneak away. I feel that giving such a small gift is too stingy, and I am really embarrassed to consume another serving of Western pastries. Xian Si.

### Small Statistics

— Xian Si

Since its inception, the United Nations Children's Welfare Fund has achieved fairly good results. The most enthusiastic country is Iceland. Their population is only 127,000, but they have donated $400,000, an average of $3 per person.

Each time the United Nations General Assembly meets, it needs the following: (1) a venue covering 110,850 square feet; (2) 600 offices for 2,600 representatives (representing 57 member states); (3) 1,000 typewriters; (4) 1,000 telephones; (5) 400 filing cabinets; (6) 2,800 first-class hotel rooms.

According to estimates by the New York Herald Tribune, more than 30,000 new "words" were added during World War II, but some of them have been gradually eliminated after the war. American scholars are studying which new words should be included in the dictionary.

### The Death of Mozart

— Huan Ren

The great musician Mozart, known as the "musical prodigy," lived in poverty all his life. Although he did not have to feign death to avoid debts like Maupassant, he did not even have money to buy charcoal in the winter. He had to put his hands in his socks and huddle in his dilapidated house to avoid the cold.

This generation of musicians died of lung disease caused by hunger, cold, and malnutrition. Mozart was short-lived, dying at the age of only thirty-six. His funeral expenses totaled only ten yuan and three cents. Although there were initially six people at the funeral, a heavy rain halfway through washed away all six mourners, so Mozart was still lonely in the end.

However, some people say that Mozart did not die of lung disease, but on the battlefield.

It is said that after saying goodbye to his lover, Gedoria, Mozart went to the battlefield and led the soldiers who raised him to charge in the wilderness and in the valleys. But once, he got lost in a valley and was captured by the enemy troops. They whipped him, kicked him, and forced him to reveal military secrets, but he just closed his eyes and did not answer. Therefore, he pitifully left this world under whipping and kicking.

It is said that he groaned like this a few times before he died:

"Saint, Gedoria..."

### Strange Footprints

— Mao Yi

This strange incident occurred in Devonshire, England, and even the most intelligent scientists and biologists have no satisfactory explanation for it. People in western Devonshire say that the devil himself once walked through the countryside eighty years ago!

It was a snowy night in the dead of winter. The next morning, strange hoof-shaped footprints, nearly one hundred miles long, were imprinted on the snow, walking along the banks of the River Axe, not only through the countryside but also over houses, walls, and sods. Some people opened their doors and found footprints had stopped at their doorsteps. What was even more surprising was that all the footprints formed a straight line.

As soon as the news spread, everyone rushed out to see what was going on. The cold winter morning was bitterly cold, so the snow had not melted yet, but the strange footprints quickly disappeared. Later, it was discovered that these strange footprints had crossed the two-mile-wide estuary of the River Axe.

Newspapers publicized and discussed it. The entire countryside was plunged into panic. Everyone locked their doors and hid at home, and dared not step out of their doors after dark.

Next, theorists offered explanations; kangaroos, moles, foxes, frogs, otters, geese, and hares were all speculated to be the owners of the strange footprints. However, the truth remained unclear – because from the footprints, the night walker was a one-legged creature. Another explanation was that because Devonshire was very close to the sea and the river, it was possible that some deep-sea creature had accidentally come ashore for a stroll.

However, whether it is a wild beast, an aquatic creature, or a flying bird, it is impossible for a one-legged creature to travel a hundred miles in a straight line on a short snowy night, and also be able to climb walls and walk on roofs.

So, where did the footprints come from? Who left them? People often attribute inexplicable mysteries to ghosts and monsters, so the people of Devonshire say that the devil walked through their land.

### The Coldest Cinema

— Liu An

In this kind of hot summer weather, if a cinema does not have air-conditioning equipment, its seats are bound to be discounted. Just imagine hundreds of people squeezed into a tightly closed room, wouldn't they be "overheated"?

However, in a place called Ivalo, a perpetually cold cinema has recently opened, completely without the need for air-conditioning equipment—the reason being that Ivalo is 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle. That cinema can probably be considered the northernmost cinema in the world. So far, the film that audiences in Ivalo like to watch the most is "Tarzan Finds a Son," which is set in the tropical jungle.

###
The two municipal councils of Beiping and Shanghai opened simultaneously, and the mayors of the two cities attended on the same day (the 22nd) to report on government affairs and answer questions. The questions and answers between the councilors and the mayors were each subtly worded, and could be described as different approaches to the same goal.

In Shanghai, Councilor Fan criticized Mayor Wu for being "slick" in his conduct. The Mayor explained that he "has never belonged to any faction, and therefore does not consider any faction when handling affairs, which may be the origin of the term 'slick'." Such a statement is not only not "slick," but also extremely "upright." It is an argument without an argument, shifting the subject and seamlessly connecting. This demonstrates the ingenuity of the phrasing, which the Chinese call "answering fluently" and the West calls "smart reply." Zhuge Liang's "debating the Confucian scholars" during the Three Kingdoms period and Napoleon's "verbally defending against the German generals" both exemplify such talent.

"Slick" is not a negative term. It is even more commonly used in modern current affairs translations and commentaries. When things are going smoothly (even better than the word "smoothly"), it is often said to be "progressing smoothly," which is not far from success. Its opposite terms are "friction" and "discord," indicating a bleak future. At the beginning of the victory, if the Five-Power Conference in London had proceeded "smoothly" and concluded satisfactorily, then the problems of Europe and Asia would have been resolved long ago. How could there have been nearly three years of "making a mess of things"? How valuable "smoothness" is! The above refers to the handling of affairs. As for "conducting oneself," then "smoothness" is certainly not a good principle, but is "uprightness" "a difficult path to walk?" It is also difficult to express in a single word. It seems necessary to put oneself in each other's shoes and study it especially. Moreover, the council mainly focuses on deliberation, while self-cultivation and conduct in the world are personal matters, and it is more appropriate to choose a quiet place for lectures to discuss morality. Regarding the Beiping councilors' attitude toward the Beiping mayor, they attached "people" to "things," which is not empty but "substantive," and does not suffer from the disease of "irrelevant writing." Comparing the two, the gains and losses are clear.

### Near Poems of Xia'an

— Ye Gongchuo

Feeling and Writing Upon Hearing of the Burial of Elder Sanyuan in West Lake, Hangzhou

The war-laden sky weighs heavily on this lake, his floating home had already drawn near Old Su. (West Lake Scholar Road is named after Su Dongpo, and the Elder rented a residence there for more than a year, where I often visited him.) He readily casts off the world's net, his spirit not yet extinguished, (When the Elder was in Baixia, he and Layman Yang Renshan opened the Jetavana Vihara, and many followed him.) Only in the poetry world, what ambition did he plan! (The Poetry World Commanders List of the Guangxu and Xuantong periods ranked the Elder as Timely Rain, but I know that was not his ambition.) His spirit of lament should dream in the Chu marshes, (The Elder grew up in Hunan. Mr. Youming governed Hunan, and many new policies were assisted by his attending court, but few know of this now.) His departing soul perhaps lingers in the Jinglu. (After the Reform Movement of 1898, the Elder served his parents and returned to Jiangxi, building a house on the Green Mountain of the Western Mountains, named Jinglu, and I have seen many poems about it, but it is now desolate.) My youth has turned white, to whom shall I look up? Turning my head and reciting the verses, a hundred sighs. (After the Reform Movement of 1898, the Elder lived in Nanchang. Because of Shi Zeng, I was able to visit the Elder, who said in the preface to my poems, "A young man often comes to my house and plays with my children." Now this young man is almost seventy, and both the Elder and Shi have passed away. The Elder greatly praised my editing and publishing of the posthumous collections of old friends, and gave me a poem saying, "Relatives and old friends entrust me with many posthumous books," which refers to this.)
