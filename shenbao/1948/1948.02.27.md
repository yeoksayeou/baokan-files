### Chairman Returns to the Capital from Guling, Will Personally Preside Over the National Affairs Conference Today; Executive Yuan Passes the Overall Political and Economic Strategies for the Central China War Zone

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] Chairman Chiang and his wife returned to Nanjing on the 26th, traveling from Guling to Xunyang by car and then plane. The plane took off from Jiujiang Shilipu Airport at 3:40 PM, with Chairman of Jiangxi Province Wang Lingji seeing them off at the airport. The plane arrived in Nanjing at 4:50 PM, accompanied by Director Yu Jishi and others. The Chairman was wearing a traditional Chinese long gown and mandarin jacket, and carrying a walking stick. The First Lady was wearing a black coat. Upon disembarking, they appeared relaxed and immediately returned to their official residence to rest. According to those close to the Chairman, during his time in Guling, besides enjoying the scenery, he read "The Scholarship Records of the Song and Yuan Dynasties" and "The Complete Works of Zeng Wenzheng," finding it very leisurely. The National Affairs Conference to be held on the 27th will be presided over by the Chairman. The Chairman's mountain retreat lasted nineteen days, coinciding with the Lunar New Year. He summoned several key officials to the mountain for consultation, leading to much speculation. It was widely believed that the Chairman had held important meetings in the mountains to discuss national affairs. In reality, the Chairman spent his days touring the scenic spots and used the peace and quiet to conduct a thorough review of the overall situation. He also drafted major plans for the future, potentially making decisions in the political and economic sectors to clarify the current state of confusion. These decisions will be gradually implemented in the near future.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The government has developed a comprehensive plan for the overall political and economic strategy in the Central China theater of war, and has drafted two corresponding sets of measures. The political component is divided into the following points: (A) Establishing secure strongholds; (B) Strengthening local organizations; (C) Expanding local armed forces; (D) Enlisting young men from the war zone. The economic component is roughly divided into: (A) Blocking supplies to the war zone; (B) Acquiring supplies from the war zone. These important strategies were passed by the Executive Yuan's provisional meeting on the 26th and will be implemented after being passed by the National Affairs Conference. It is also reported that some key points include issuing grain coupons in combat zones, purchasing grain, allowing farmers to use grain coupons to exchange for other goods in various regions, equivalent to using legal tender. Secondly, young men in bandit suppression areas will be organized into self-defense forces, with detailed regulations.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The Executive Yuan held a provisional meeting on the 26th, presided over by Zhang Qun. In addition to passing the political and economic strategies for the overall war in Central China and the second phase of demobilization for volunteer intellectual youth, there were two other cases submitted for review: (A) Whether to continue participating in various international conferences this year due to foreign exchange difficulties; (B) The minimum capital requirements for banks and money shops, and restrictions on establishing new banks and money shops in certain areas.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] In order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures and stabilize financial markets in various regions, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued orders restricting the establishment of banks and money shops. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has recently drafted measures regarding the minimum capital requirements for banks and money shops, and restrictions on establishing new banks and money shops in certain areas. These measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan discussed them at the regular meeting on the 26th, but did not pass them. The Ministry of Finance was instructed to revise them and resubmit them to the Executive Yuan for review. The main point is to increase the capital requirements for various banks and money shops, such as setting the minimum capital for limited liability banks at 20 billion yuan, and the minimum capital for unlimited liability banks at 10 billion yuan, with money shops halved. However, a final decision is pending further revisions by the Ministry of Finance.

### Government Determined to Stabilize Prices Nationwide, Those Spreading Rumors with Evidence to Be Punished by Military Law

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] In recent days, rumors have spread rapidly in Shanghai, causing prices to skyrocket and the market to be in chaos. The severity of the situation surpasses the gold rush of February last year. As a result, markets in Nanjing and other regions have been greatly affected, causing greater suffering to ordinary people. This situation has drawn the attention of officials here. Government officials believe that the current market chaos, with simultaneous surges in gold, currency, grain, yarn, and general merchandise, is clearly the work of unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market. This behavior violates the anti-rebellion laws. The government has decided to immediately dispatch personnel to Shanghai to secretly investigate the situation. They are confident that they have a good understanding of the current situation and will make appropriate decisions. Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing from Guling to handle national affairs. The issue of Northeast China is receiving special attention from both the government and the public. They are currently studying fundamental solutions to resolve the crisis. The most urgent need is to transport large forces to provide reinforcements, which has already begun. On the economic front, the government controls ample supplies of grain and yarn. All of this should not lead to economic chaos. In addition to investigating the reasons for the price increases, they will also focus on the spread of rumors. If there is solid evidence, they will be punished by military law to stabilize prices and deter others. According to authoritative sources, the main reason for the current price surge is the excessive number of bizarre rumors, such as those about Chairman Chiang and the military situation in Northeast China, which are all false. Chairman Chiang went to Guling for a short stay to oversee the overall situation. Therefore, we can confidently say that the price surge is undoubtedly manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. The government is determined to take decisive measures and will not be lenient. (The price situation in various regions is published in the left corner of page two)

### Production Improvement Plan for Four Export Commodities

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The National Economic Council held its 35th regular meeting at 3:00 PM on the 26th, chaired by Wang Yunwu. The secretariat first reported on: (1) Adjusting domestic exchange rates and restricting the transfer of funds to Shanghai and Guangzhou; (2) Revising Article 4 of the regulations on gold jewelry trading by gold shops; (3) The original plan for implementing measures to increase production of materials under the Economic Reform Plan; (4) Reviewing and revising proposals. Subsequently, Huang Yuanbin reported on the economic situation in South China, Liu Zhendong reported on the economic situation in Shandong, and Gu Yulang reported on price developments over the past week. The council then discussed the "Production Improvement Plan for Four Export Commodities: Silk, Tung Oil, Tea, and Wool," drafted by the Ministry of Agriculture and submitted by the Executive Yuan. The plan is largely based on recommendations from the Sino-American Agricultural Survey Team. It was decided to resubmit the plan for review, and Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, Wang Xiaolai, He Haoruo, Huang Yuanbin, Liu Zhendong, and Huo Baoshu were appointed as review committee members, convened by Zuo Shunsheng. The production improvement plan has a three-year target and aims to increase production as follows: (1) Tung oil: Increase production to 60,000 tons in the first year, 80,000 tons in the second year, and 100,000 tons in the third year. (2) Silk: Produce 65,000 dan of raw silk and 8 million yards of silk fabrics for export within three years. (3) Tea: Aim to produce 1.2 million dan within the year. (4) Wool: Hope to produce 220 million pounds of coarse wool for carpets and 480 million pounds of fine wool annually.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] Wang Xiaolai spoke at the National Economic Council on the 26th, commenting on the recent surge in rice prices in Shanghai. Wang said that there are many reasons for the increase in rice prices in Shanghai, but recent restrictions on the rice market have also contributed to the price surge. If the Shanghai rice market could restore a free market, the rice price surge might be slightly eased. However, the issue was not formally discussed at the meeting, so no specific decisions were made.

### Our Country's Export Goods

Still Need Foreign Ship Assistance for Transportation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] Ministry of Communications news: Regarding rumors that all of our country's export goods will be transported by domestic ships, the person in charge of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry stated that the maritime industry had previously expressed some views on this matter. The Ministry strongly supports the principle of using domestic ships to transport export goods, but because it relates to international trade, there is no absolute prohibition on foreign ships carrying goods. Because our country's export goods are increasing daily and our country's ships are limited, foreign ships are still needed in practice.

### The "Democratic League" Has Long Been Deteriorated, Not a Neutral Political Group, Wu Tiecheng Criticizes Those Who Have Illusions About the "Democratic League"

[Our Society Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] Regarding the "Democratic League" fugitive conspiracy members publicly denying its headquarters dissolution order declaration, abandoning the neutral route, participating in Communist bandit armed rebellion and instigating anti-government and anti-American movements, the reporter visited Wu Tiecheng and received his comments: "The 'Democratic League' was initially formed by several political groups. At that time, the majority of the responsible people did have political ambitions and contributed opinions to the government to conduct legitimate political activities. However, since the reorganization in September 1944, it has been transformed from a neutral political group into an outer periphery of the Communist Party, in addition to echoing the Communist Party in political propositions and accepting its subsidies. This caused dissatisfaction among other patriotic members within the organization and eventually led to a split. Last November, in order to actively implement the General Mobilization for Bandit Suppression, the government could not allow the 'Democratic League' to engage in illegal activities on both sides, so it clearly ordered that activities should be stopped immediately. Fortunately, the responsible people of the 'Democratic League' were able to abide by the law and announced the automatic dissolution. People such as Huang Yanpei, Zhang Lan, Luo Longji and Liang Shuming have abandoned political activities and returned to their old careers. The 'Democratic League' meeting in Hong Kong not only attempted to revive the ashes, but also exposed the true face of a small number of members. We carefully examined their so-called political report and declaration of the Third Plenary Session, and it is completely in line with the Communist bandits. I deeply believe that the anti-American and anti-government armed struggle that they advocate will never win the sympathy of patriots. What I cannot understand is that some foreign people still say that the 'Democratic League' is a neutral political group or call it the middle route, and pin their sympathy and hope on it, and even fantasize that the development of the 'Democratic League' and other similar political groups may help solve the China problem. Their lack of political insight is deplorable."

### Dong Guang's Remarks

Zhang Bojun and Others' Conspiracy in Hong Kong

Treat It as a Communist Bandit Disguised Organization

[Our Dispatch Nanjing, 26th] Dong Guang, Director of the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan, issued a statement regarding the Democratic League members fleeing to Hong Kong to rely on the Communist bandits and openly declaring their participation in the rebellion, stating: "The Democratic League had a history of colluding with the Communist bandits in the past, and the government strongly cracked down on it. Several members of the Democratic League, from its headquarters leader Zhang Lan downwards, such as Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, etc., have remained in various places in the country as usual since the "Democratic League" voluntarily announced its dissolution last winter. However, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru and others secretly went to Hong Kong to collude with Communist bandits personnel and secretly planned to restore the organization and participate in the Communist bandits rebellion. The tactics of Zhang, Shen and others not only exposed their inextricable relationship with the Communist bandits over the years, but also proved that the "Democratic League" that they are calling for today is no different from the Communist bandits' adopted son. No wonder the treasonous slogans they advocate are exactly the same as the Communist bandits. We should treat their conspiratorial organizations and their secret activities as disguised organizations of the Communist bandits.

### Utilizing US Aid to Develop the Guangdong-Hankou Railway; Guangzhou City to Establish Carriage Factory; Railway Construction Planned from Guangzhou to Macau

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Following the announcement of the US$60 million loan to revitalize the Yuehan Railway, locals have expressed excitement. According to the Guangzhou office of the railway, they submitted a restoration plan for over US$40 million to Marshall last year. The United States also sent personnel to inspect the line seven or eight times. Securing at least US$40 million to improve and expand the railway in the future is no longer an issue. The line inspection team for the railway recently completed its work and submitted a detailed supplementary improvement plan to Director Du Zhenyuan. As for the allocation of the loan, plans include using one million to establish a machinery factory, carriage factory, and casting factory in Xicun, Guangzhou, to produce carriages, rails, and other equipment. Another one million will be used to renovate various stations. Song Ziwen hopes to quickly build the Gouyadong branch line.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Holds Secret Meeting; Marshall to Explain China Aid Bill

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Chairman Vandenberg of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that Marshall will attend a secret meeting of the committee on the 26th to explain the US$570 million China aid plan. Beyond this brief statement, Vandenberg declined to say whether other State Department officials or Wedemeyer were also invited to provide opinions on the China issue. Due to severe criticism from Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft regarding the lack of military assistance in Truman's China aid plan, it is believed that Republican senators will ask Marshall to explain this point. According to information obtained by reporters from reliable sources, Vandenberg wants Congress to clarify the European Recovery Program before dealing with the China aid plan. The debate on the Senate's European Recovery Program will begin on March 1st. If the House Foreign Affairs Committee includes aid to China in the legislation for the European Recovery Program and the House finally passes it, the Senate may be forced to amend its current bill during the debate or in a joint conference of the two houses after both houses of Congress pass the measure.

### Progress in Public Security in South China; Rural Decline is Worrying

Huang Shaohong's Remarks After Returning from a Trip to the South

[Our City News] National Government Committee Member Huang Shaohong, upon returning from a trip to the South, received reporters on the 26th and stated: The public security situation in South China has improved compared to the past. Given sufficient time, it will definitely become more stable. Banditry in South China is not as serious as rumored. Huang recently returned to his hometown for a two-month stay. He said: The impression gained from the trip to the South is that the countryside is declining. No more than two or three out of ten families are adequately fed and clothed. This phenomenon is extremely worrying. The fundamental plan for stabilizing the region lies in stabilizing the economy, ensuring that all people have a way to make a living to avoid resorting to desperate measures. If one seeks superficial solutions instead of addressing the root cause, although temporary effects may be achieved, it will not be a long-term solution. Therefore, I believe that all government measures should prioritize stability. Any measure that significantly affects the livelihood of the people should be thoroughly reviewed, and the preferences of a few should not be allowed to harm the lives of the majority.

Essay

### Parliament and Newspapers

— Shao Yongsheng

These days, the Shanghai Municipal Council is holding its fifth general meeting. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the relationship between parliaments and newspapers.

Now that the constitution has been implemented, how do we prevent it from becoming a "constitution on paper"? Now that the democratic political system has been implemented, how do we make local governments at all levels vibrant? How do we guide the public to care about politics when they do not? How do we inspire their interest in politics when they are not interested? The responsibility for most of these tasks falls first on the shoulders of parliaments and newspapers.

As an elected member of parliament in China, one should keenly feel that one's current responsibility is greater than that of members of parliament in any advanced democratic country in the world. Members of parliament should have a spirit of sacrifice, abandoning all personal prejudices to serve the public. In particular, they must eliminate the corrupt practices that have been unavoidable in past parliaments and avoid using parliament to control officials for personal gain.

During this period of democratic political enlightenment, the responsibility for guiding the public to care about politics, enlightening the public's interest in politics, and instructing the public to accurately distinguish and recognize their own interests largely falls on newspapers.

Because newspapers are truly a powerful tool for promoting this work. This tool must be used for the benefit of the public, and those who wield this tool should be people who act solely on justice, without prejudice, and with prudence and fairness. If this tool of propaganda, this guardian of democratic politics, namely the newspaper, is unwilling or unable to fulfill its due responsibilities, then China's democratic future will appear bleak.

The Shanghai Municipal Council has been established for a year and a half, has held four general meetings, resolved many cases, and passed two budget and final accounts bills. Its achievements can be said to be considerable. However, observing the general public, most of them can be said to be indifferent to the representatives they elected, the council they formed, the work they are doing, the content of the cases they are discussing, and all the dynamics related to the Municipal Council. Why are the majority of Shanghai citizens so uninterested in municipal facilities, reforms, and their own obligations and rights, which are closely related to them?

Before answering this question and studying its causes, I would like to cite the words of US Ambassador Stuart as a reference: At the end of last year, Ambassador Stuart delivered a "Letter to the Chinese People" at the general meeting of the Journalism Department of Yenching University. The ambassador said: "I have pointed out that China's constitution has now been implemented, but some people doubt whether it can be more effective than a constitution on paper. I believe that this depends on the efforts of the Chinese people. Although most people are too busy with their daily lives to participate in this, intellectuals, non-party members, free men, and journalists should rise up to defend the rights and obligations of Chinese citizens. Relying solely on the government, or solely on government initiatives, cannot make the constitution work effectively and achieve the necessary reforms. However, through freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, as well as the accurate execution of elections, the people can achieve reforms in a democratic way. Many responsible officials in the government also greatly hope for effective reforms." Ambassador Stuart, as a representative of a foreign country, cares for and expects more from China than any Chinese compatriot. He has expressed that he considers himself a Chinese person, and his sympathy for China can be regarded as that of a close Chinese friend. Such a well-intentioned and sincere criticism from a close friend should be valued and reflected upon by all of us.

Thanks to Ambassador Stuart's wise judgment, I, as an elected member of parliament of this city, use my experiences to confirm his deductions, which further shows that his theory is quite accurate.

In fact, the so-called party members, non-party members, intellectuals, free men, and journalists are all included in the elected parliament, the Shanghai Municipal Council. To prevent the constitution from becoming a "constitution on paper," to make local governments at all levels under democratic politics vibrant, to make every citizen interested in politics, to make them care about the work done by parliament and parliamentarians on their behalf, and to cultivate the ability to judge right and wrong to determine what to choose, and then to accurately execute elections to achieve the purpose of assisting and supervising the government to seek the welfare of all citizens. This certainly cannot be achieved overnight, but the responsibility for promoting this work currently falls on the shoulders of parliament and newspapers. This is not only because the parliament includes party members, non-party members, intellectuals, free men, and journalists, but also because the council can concentrate and exert the rights granted to the people by the constitution. And newspapers are even more important tools for arousing people's attention, guiding people's concern, inspiring people's interest, and instructing people's accurate judgment.

In fact, in the promotion of democratic politics, the responsibility borne by newspapers, as well as the effects they receive, are much greater than those of parliament.

To make the government vibrant, the parliament must be vibrant; to make the parliament vibrant, the people must have familiarity and interest in the parliament and politics; to make the people interested, they must rely on the encouragement and enlightenment of newspapers. At the same time, both parliament and government rely on the supervision of newspapers.

If the citizens of Shanghai are truly indifferent and uninterested in the Municipal Council, the organ that represents them in exercising their powers and undertaking their obligations, it is not the best phenomenon. But this may be a phenomenon that is unavoidable in the era of democratic enlightenment. To study the reasons, it is best to review the past facts. In fact, the parliament itself and the newspapers are both responsible for improving this phenomenon.

There is no need to talk about the past. After the implementation of the constitution, we should think about whether newspapers can do something to improve citizens' concern, interest, and discernment in parliamentary politics. Here, I would like to publicly discuss a plan that I have long cherished in my heart.

Every time I see the Municipal Council holding a general meeting, the number of people in the audience is sparse, sometimes even empty. This time the phenomenon has progressed, and the audience has been quite lively for the past three days. But in any case, I seem to feel the sadness that the council is being abandoned by the citizens. The councilors debate on the stage, expressing their views, only for the councilors themselves to hear. In addition, only the newspaper reporters are concentrating and writing diligently. What is seen in the newspaper tomorrow, either due to space limitations or because there are too many proposals, is all brief and not detailed. The citizens cannot know the details of the debate at the time regarding the opinions expressed by each councilor on each proposal, whether positive or negative. Therefore, they cannot understand the importance of the process from debate to conclusion to stimulate their attention, concern, and judgment. Moreover, each proposal has its own unique nature and factors, and it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of the outline beforehand. Therefore, it is no wonder that citizens are not very interested based solely on the little bit of information recorded in the newspapers. The way to remedy this is to make as much use of radio broadcasting as possible to send the voices of the people's representatives into the ears of the people.

Although the council now has broadcasting equipment, which is rebroadcast by a radio station - Xindu Radio Station (frequency 1330), the preparatory work is still insufficient. Because without the cooperation of newspaper offices and coordination with newspapers, I am afraid that few citizens will still listen to the council's broadcasts (I am afraid that few people know that there are broadcasts when the council is in session). Moreover, when listening, it is difficult to find clues, so the effect is naturally minimal. I think at least the following methods should be adopted.

The Municipal Council should announce the already scheduled agenda in the newspaper one day in advance (as much as possible to avoid temporary changes after the agenda is scheduled). The important proposals should be briefly explained so that citizens can understand the importance of each proposal and then choose the proposals they are concerned about and interested in, and listen to the debate of the councilors and the results at that time. In addition, the relay broadcasting station should also strive to increase the number of stations. The main thing is the cooperation of newspaper offices. I sincerely hope that the newspaper offices will also participate in and assist in the work of using radio reports. On the one hand, they should encourage citizens to listen to the council's broadcasts. On the other hand, the newspaper offices should cooperate with the council and the radio station to send reporters to serve as broadcasting reporters, in the same way as stage broadcasting reporters. Before the discussion of each important proposal begins, make a brief introduction, and after the debate ends, report on the dynamics, trends, results, and atmosphere of the debate on the proposal. If the description is made in concise and lively words, it will be able to arouse great interest among the audience and citizens. It is even more necessary to install temporary loudspeakers in public places or in front of newspaper offices so that citizens who do not have radios can listen. This is a training course for the public to care about politics. Every newspaper office is worth using and should use it! I believe that the reporters will also feel interested and willing to work for this great and meaningful work of promoting democratic politics. This is equivalent to an active newspaper, with reporters using their mouths instead of pens. The arguments made by the councilors are directly sent into the ears of the citizens, and the citizens will unconsciously feel the importance of municipal administration and its relationship with themselves, and increase their degree of concern and interest. Only then will the citizens cherish their votes in the next election, and will not easily give up and despise the election, and will ultimately be of some help to the so-called promotion of good people in politics. The voices of public reason and justice, and the distorted and selfish arguments, after being considered in the hearts of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, thought about in their minds, and expressed in their mouths, the people and the newspapers will be in step, and fairness will be in the hearts of the people, and then the true value and true authority of public opinion will be revealed!

The councilors will also inevitably do their best and think more about the interests of the majority of the people, and express their most quintessential arguments. The atmosphere in the council will be more enthusiastic than in the past, and the spirit of the council will be more brilliant than in the past, and boring arguments and boring reversals will be reduced. As for those who want to use the power of the council to control officials for personal gain, there should certainly not be any now, and there may not be any in the future, and at the very least they will have some scruples.

The reason why I have repeatedly stated this is because our country's democracy is in its enlightenment era. At the beginning, the people's representatives should all have good habits and establish good customs. What's more, Shanghai's material conditions are good enough to do this, and it does not require much expense, but the effects and gains are incalculably large. The original broadcasting method of the Municipal Council is not sufficient, and not many citizens know about it. The agenda discussion date and radio frequency are not announced in the newspaper in advance, and only one broadcasting station is too few, and there are no reporters to make explanations (this is the most important point). Therefore, the effect of the council's broadcasts without the participation of newspaper offices and the coordination of newspapers is not great, and it cannot arouse much attention from the people. I hope that this shallow article of mine can arouse the attention of the authorities of the newspaper offices, and I warmly hope that the newspaper offices will unite to organize this matter.

This move must be supervised and organized by a third party other than the council and the government. Who is more suitable to undertake this task than the propaganda weapon and the guardian of democratic politics - the newspaper?

We have discussed the issue of voting in the upcoming National Assembly meeting. As for the presidential candidate, Mr. Chiang is naturally praised by the whole country. As for the vice-presidential candidate, there are two very simple conditions: (1) If the President is from the South, the Vice President should be from the North; (2) If the President is a military man, the Vice President should be a civilian. Therefore, after discussing with Mr. Du, we two have decided to cast our votes for Mr. Yu in the upcoming Vice Presidential election." Cheng Cangbo, on behalf of seventeen sponsors, read out the "Draft Outline for Supporting Mr. Yu Youren's Candidacy for Vice President" which was distributed on the spot.

### Northeastern People's Relief Association Offers Suggestions to Save the Critical Situation

(Continued from page one) (1) Appoint Northeastern generals, give them real power, and establish a force of more than ten armies. (2) Increase troops and ensure the Yu-Pan Corridor. (3) Find an opportunity to use the main force to break into the bandit area and conduct guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. General Ma Zhanshan still retains influence in the Northeast because many of his former subordinates are in the bandit area. Yesterday's reception was hosted by Xu Chengjia, who stated that the association is "a mass organization of Northeastern youth, with a purely public-opinion standpoint with no party affiliation." The report believes that the severity of the situation in the Northeast is caused by the following failures: (1) Blind faith in diplomacy, (2) Misunderstanding of peace talks, (3) Inability to effectively utilize puppet troops and mass forces, (4) Lack of smooth handling of defectors, (5) Lack of methods for organizing and training the masses, (6) Disconnection between officials and the people, (7) Intellectual youth are emotional. The association also issued a warning: saying that the Northeast is facing a second "September 18th Incident," and the severity is even greater because the communist bandits can organize the masses. If the Northeast falls, it will be extremely difficult to recover in the future. Regarding the strength of the bandit army in the Northeast, people from the association said that in November 1947, there were a total of four military regions with more than 580,000 soldiers. There have been increases in personnel, all equipped with Japanese-style equipment, slightly inferior to the National Army; the Air Force is also training in Jiamusi, using old Japanese aircraft, on a small scale.

Eight representatives of the Relief Association came south, and a part has already arrived in Nanjing. The three representatives in Shanghai will go to Nanjing today. It is said that they will find a way to meet with the authorities to present their opinions in person.

### Northeastern Industrial and Mining Cadres Will Work Until the Very End

They may leave the Northeast only under the conditions that there are spare flight slots and that the Northeast no longer needs them. The timing of the evacuation should be appropriate, not too early nor too late, to avoid the losses of Anshan again. Xie Shuying, the person in charge of the National Resources Commission in the Northeast, and Shao Yizhou, the manager of the Anshan Company, and other senior personnel will come to Ping from Shenyang to meet with Sun to discuss emergency measures and then return to Shenyang. There are currently more than 500 industrial and mining employees from the Northeast gathered in Ping.

However, Changlu's output is only sufficient for this year's needs and has no ability to transport it to Japan. It is also learned that Changlu Salt is expected to produce ten million zu this year, and salt drying has already begun. The first batch of 20 billion in loans for Changlu salt production has been allocated, the second batch is still 20 billion, and the third batch is 47 billion.

Yan Elaborates on Civilian Economy

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 26th] The Shanghai Reporter Northwest Inspection Delegation arrived in Bing at 4:00 PM on the 25th and attended a joint banquet hosted by local reporters in the evening.

Recently, in coordination with needs, plans have been made to manufacture machinery, build the Fen River Reservoir, hold joint morning villages, implement mechanical farming, and increase the production of steel and cement. Finally, he strongly condemned the communist bandits for making robbers into sages and robbers into animal alliances, and hoped that the country would intensify its suppression of the rebellion.

### Price Trends in Various Regions: Beiping Reaches New Peak; Price Hikes in Guangzhou Gradually Stabilizing

Suzhou County Government Abandons Price Controls

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] News of the price hikes in Shanghai has reached the capital, creating even greater turbulence in the Beiping market. Beiping prices have been soaring for days, reaching a new peak on the 26th, setting an unprecedented record, with prices changing multiple times a day, creating a chaotic situation. Gold, banknotes, grain, cloth, and groceries have seen the most drastic increases. The black market price of gold has jumped again and again, with pawnshops only buying and not selling, in a semi-closed state. Negotiated grain prices this morning rose to 300,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), foreign-grown cooked rice at 2.8 million per dan, black market cooked rice at 2.7 million, yellow cooked rice at 2.5 million, superior cooked rice at 2.4 million, flour at 1.33 million per bag. Cotton cloth prices varied, with transactions light, each item increasing by 100,000 to 200,000, and even 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Imported groceries have been soaring, with cigarettes, matches, soap, and kerosene all experiencing runaway price increases.

Guangzhou [Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 26th] The situation here has gradually stabilized on the 26th. In the financial market, the Hong Kong dollar has fallen sharply, closing at only 520 on the 25th, with no improvement today. Grain prices have also gradually eased. The Grain Management Association is selling off large quantities of stored rice. Grain merchants, in order to help the government suppress the chaotic situation, have also decided to sell off all their stored grain. The Grain Control Office has also notified citizens that if rice merchants do not sell at the limited price, they can report them to the police for investigation. Therefore, the momentum of grain price increases has gradually slowed down. Furthermore, to stabilize the financial situation, the Guangzhou Headquarters convened an emergency meeting on the 26th with relevant departments. In addition to ordering the military police and anti-smuggling agencies to strictly investigate the flow of speculative funds, a special court will be established to try illegal speculators who disrupt the market according to military law.

Suzhou [Our Suzhou Dispatch, 26th] Prices here are difficult to suppress. Rice, flour, wheat, vegetable oil, sugar, yarn, silk, cigarettes, and local specialties have all risen, creating a general atmosphere of price increases, causing widespread anxiety throughout the city. Although the market price of rice has been raised to 2.3 million yuan per dan, it is still far from the actual price, resulting in transactions in the market being conducted in secret, with people having to resort to the black market to obtain rice. Both grain merchants and the public feel inconvenienced. The Suzhou County Government has resolutely decided to cancel all price controls from the 27th, with industry associations negotiating prices themselves. County Magistrate Wang Jiefo has also issued four orders to the Social Affairs Section: (1) Crack down on non-merchants using speculative funds for transactions; (2) Investigate the inventory of each store; (3) The daily sales volume of each store must be registered individually; (4) Rice and flour prices must not be higher than those in Shanghai and Wuxi, otherwise, those violating this will be detained and interrogated by the military law office. It is reported that the price of white rice on the 27th has been negotiated by the Grain Industry Association and submitted to the County Government for approval, with a market price of 2.7 million yuan per dan, and a slightly higher profit of 100,000 yuan per dan for retail sales.

Zhenjiang [Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 26th] Prices in Zhenjiang continue to rise today. Superior rice is 2.6 million yuan per shi (unit of volume), soybean oil is 38,000 yuan per jin (unit of weight), and the prices of other goods are rising daily and nightly. Merchants and the public are mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude, with no buying or selling.

[Another Dispatch] Since the central government has stipulated free trade of rice and grain in various regions, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to hold price-controlled rice sales during the lean season to maintain the people's food supply and prevent shortages.

Wuxi [Our Wuxi Dispatch, 26th] After the price controls on rice paddy were lifted by the authorities yesterday, the money supply tightened. The Central Bank continuously infused currency and the black market interest rate soared to over 10%. Market prices remain high: white japonica rice 2,700,400 yuan, "yangxian" rice 2,660,400 yuan, "bufu" rice 2,570,400 yuan, "kexian" rice 2,550,000 yuan, "yuan" rice 2,770,400 yuan, japonica paddy 1,200,200 yuan, "yuan" paddy 1,230,700 yuan, "yangxian" paddy 1,150,500 yuan, "bufu" paddy 1,140,200 yuan, "waijiang" paddy 1,150,200 yuan, "xinghua" paddy 1,120,200 yuan, wheat 3,570,000 yuan, white wheat 3,600,000 yuan, up over 200,000 yuan, flour 1,370,500 yuan, soybean oil 6,350,000 yuan, cotton yarn 73,600,000 yuan, up another 4,800,000 yuan.

Jiangyin [Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 26th] Rice prices are soaring, and people's livelihoods are unstable. The county government has convened another meeting of grain merchants, deciding to allow free market trading outside the market from the 26th, with prices not exceeding those in Wuxi. The price limit is relaxed, based on standard white japonica rice, selling at 1,800,000 yuan. With a household registration certificate, each person is limited to purchasing seven sheng (unit of volume). Export of over 20 shi (unit of volume) requires government permission.

Wuhu [Our Wuhu Dispatch, 26th] Prices of all goods in Wuhu have risen again, with milled rice now at 2,300,000 yuan.

Hankou [Our Hankou Dispatch, 26th] Prices in Wuhan are fluctuating across the board, especially cotton yarn, which has risen the most sharply. 20-count "Red Ball" yarn is now as high as 63,000,000 yuan. Medium-grade milled rice has broken the 2,000,000 yuan barrier. Each sesame cake has reached 5,000 yuan. The general market is refusing to accept 1,000 yuan banknotes. The Municipal Council has sent a letter to the Gold Control Bureau requesting the establishment of more exchange agencies.

Guilin [Our Guilin Dispatch, 26th] Since the Spring Festival, rice prices here have risen sharply, especially in the last few days. In just three days, they have risen from over 700,000 yuan to 1,100,000 yuan, and it seems that they will continue to rise.

Chengdu [Our Chengdu Dispatch, 26th] The price surge in Chengdu is severe. A half-double (unit of weight) stone of rice has broken the 3,000,000 yuan barrier on the 26th. Cotton yarn, cloth factories, and department stores have all announced price increases. The provincial government convened an emergency joint meeting of the heads of various agencies in Chengdu today, presided over by Deng Xihou, deciding to use administrative power to urgently curb the price surge.

Xi'an [Our Xi'an Dispatch, 26th] The price of gold in Xi'an suddenly soared after 9:00 am on the 26th. Gold shops selling prices have broken the 20,000,000 yuan mark, and buying prices have also risen to 18,000,000 yuan. Market goods seem to have been stimulated and have become more active, with prices generally rising. Cotton yarn has risen 3,000,000 yuan per piece compared to yesterday, cigarettes have risen 1,500,000 yuan per carton, and paint has risen 2,000,000 yuan per box.

Qingdao [Our Qingdao Dispatch, 26th] Prices in Qingdao have gone wild. "Soldier Ship" brand flour has broken the 2,000,000 yuan barrier.

### Communist Coup in Czechoslovakia Threatens People's Freedom; US, UK, and France Strongly Condemn; US May Impose Economic Sanctions on Czechoslovakia

[Our Dispatch] New York, 26th Broadcast: Washington News, the United States, Britain, and France issued a statement accusing the Communist Party of the coup in Czechoslovakia, which constitutes a "disguised dictatorship" and threatens the existence of the principles of freedom, which will have extremely adverse effects on the people of Czechoslovakia. The statement was initiated by the United States, and was formally announced after consultations with Britain and France in the past 24 hours.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] According to well-informed sources here, the U.S. Department of State will present a severe protest note to the Gottwald government of Czechoslovakia. The source suggested that the United States may take economic sanctions against Czechoslovakia.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Government sources said that due to the Communist seizure of power in Czechoslovakia, the United States may further reduce credit loans to Czechoslovakia, or stop exports to Czechoslovakia, especially machinery. U.S. officials believe that the U.S. may not sever diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia, as they want to maintain a "window behind the Iron Curtain" in Prague.

[Central News Agency, New York, 25th] After the Communist Party seized power in Czechoslovakia, most Americans sympathize with the brave and melancholy people of Czechoslovakia. As there are about one million American citizens of Czech descent in the United States, and the Republic of Czechoslovakia was born in the United States after the last war, great importance is attached here to reports of the new developments in Czechoslovakia.

[Reuters, London, 25th] Political figures here pointed out that although the new Czech cabinet is still a coalition cabinet, all important positions have been monopolized by the Communist Party. The general election to be held next month can serve as an effective test to prove whether this coalition cabinet is merely a facade. It is also expected here that the Communist Party may follow the example of Hungary and Poland, and propose a list of candidates based on the government group. The Communist Party now controls all domestic security in Czechoslovakia, with the Ministries of Interior and Justice both occupied by the Communist Party. Therefore, Communist Party members will also serve as presiding judges in the trial of those accused of conspiracy in the so-called coup.

### Czechoslovak Communist Party Seizes Power; Nationwide Purge Campaign Carried Out

[Our Dispatch] London, 26th Broadcast: Prague News, senior officials said that President Beneš bowed to the Communist Party to avoid bloodshed. The President may resign or flee the country to express his position. It is rumored that Beneš is currently ill, as the emotional tension during the cabinet crisis made it impossible for him to continue.

[Reuters, Prague, 26th] Prague is very quiet today. Generally, it is believed that the political crisis that lasted for a week has ended, and the Communist Party has achieved complete victory. National flags are flying throughout the city, and the public is celebrating with dances to show the workers' support for the new regime.

[United Press, Prague, 26th] On the first day of the new regime of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, a purge campaign was carried out in various departments and organizations. Fourteen people were purged from the Ministry of Transport, more than seven from the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, fifteen from the Ministry of Domestic Trade, and some from the Ministry of Education. The purge is not limited to various departments of the government. In addition, purges are also being carried out in the councils of various districts and cities, political parties, social organizations, state-owned enterprises, and factories.

[Reuters, Prague, 25th] Of the 24 members of the new cabinet announced by Gottwald, the Communist Party occupies 12 seats, and the Social Democratic Party that supports the Communist Party also occupies 4 seats. Therefore, the Communist Party has absolute majority control in the new cabinet. The Communist Party occupies 114 seats in the National Assembly, which has 300 members. Adding the 39 seats of the Social Democratic Party that supports the Communist Party can ensure them a majority in the National Assembly.

### Finland's Future is Worrying

[Associated Press, London, 25th] It is speculated here tonight that Finland is likely to be the next country in Europe to experience Communist control.

### US Formally Proposes Establishing a Five-Power Committee to Review the Situation in the Holy Land

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 25th] The chief U.S. representative, Austin, formally proposed today in the Security Council that the five major powers (China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union) jointly find a solution to the Palestine problem, examine whether the situation in the Holy Land constitutes a threat to peace, and consult with the Arab, Jewish, and British parties on methods to implement the UN Partition Plan. At the same time, the United States expressed opposition to the proposal by Colombia to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly to reconsider the Partition Plan. However, according to British sources, the British government is doubtful about agreeing to consultations between the five major powers and the parties involved, as the United Kingdom is scheduled to withdraw from Palestine before August 1 and will not participate in the implementation of the Partition Plan.

### British Army Commander Publishes Report on Service in the Far East

Full Text of 200,000 Words

[Reuters, London, 26th] The report of the British Army Commander in the battles of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies at the beginning of the Pacific War, with a full text of 200,000 words, was published today. It shows that at the beginning of the Japanese offensive in December 1941, the United Kingdom was completely unprepared for a full-scale war in the Far East. In Malaya, the troops were not well-trained, tanks were completely absent, and air support was extremely weak. The Japanese army, on the other hand, had 300 tanks, strong air force cover, and its attacking troops were well-trained assault troops. As for the British Navy, it never controlled the seas of East Asia.

### New Riots in South Korea, Similar in Nature to the Situation in Early Last Month; Small Assembly Yet to Vote on South Korean Elections

[Associated Press, Seoul, 26th] U.S. military authorities announced today that the Communist Party has instigated riots again, opposing the United Nations Korean Election Supervisory Commission. As a result, 56 Korean people and one police officer were killed, and 13 people were seriously injured. Each group of rioters ranged from 50 to 1,000 people. In addition to attacking police posts in various parts of southern Korea, they also destroyed bridges, cut power lines, and set up obstacles on the railway tracks. This matter is similar in nature to the riots on the 7th of last month, when 47 people died. The Korean Independence Memorial Day on March 1 is approaching, and public sentiment is very excited.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 25th] Norwegian representative Mowinckel proposed today in the United Nations Small Assembly to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to re-discuss the Korean issue. He stated that if the United Nations agency disregards Soviet opposition and hastily implements the resolutions on the Korean issue, it may create a situation similar to that in Palestine. The Small Assembly is scheduled to continue its meeting tomorrow. A vote on the U.S. proposal to instruct the resident mission in Korea to do its best to conduct elections has not been taken. The Philippines, India, Dominica, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Thailand, France, and Uruguay all supported the U.S. proposal. Mowinckel also stated, "If one of the United States and the Soviet Union withdraws its occupation forces, a civil war may occur in Korea, and the United Nations agency may face the question of whether to send troops to maintain order. In order to resolve the Korean issue satisfactorily, we must find a way to urge the United States and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement, but to reach such an agreement, we must consider whether it is worthwhile to convene a special session of the General Assembly." Before the adjournment of the Small Assembly, Philippine representative Romulo advocated the release of Korean political prisoners so that elections could be conducted in a free atmosphere.

### Conference of Sixteen European Countries

To Be Held in Paris in Mid-April

[Reuters, London, 25th] The British Foreign Office recently confirmed that Britain and France are contacting the other fourteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan to discuss the possibility of reopening the European Recovery Conference. A spokesperson said that this conference will be held in Paris in mid-April. The discussion items include: (1) the progress of the sixteen Western European countries in economic cooperation since their meeting last summer; (2) the reports of the technical committees on fuel, electricity, steel, food, and manpower; (3) the establishment of a permanent institution representing the sixteen countries to handle U.S. aid.

### Turkey Strengthens Defense Capabilities; No Change in Relations with the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Istanbul, 25th] Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak told reporters here that half of Turkey's national budget is spent on national defense, which proves that Turkey is the most vulnerable to external pressure among European countries. Under this psychology, Turkey has strengthened its national defense without hesitation. The world knows that Turkey has never had aggressive ambitions towards anyone. He also said, "I am convinced that 1948 is one of the most serious years since the war. However, the possibility of a third world war is still low." Speaking of the issue with the Soviet Union, he said, "There has never been any change in Turkey's relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has requested our approval for its new ambassador to Turkey, and we have appointed a professor of socioeconomics as the new ambassador."

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 25th] The diplomatic commentator of "Pravda" cited the public statement of the Turkish Ambassador to Egypt as proof that "Turkey has strengthened its troops on the Soviet-Turkish border after receiving aid from Britain and the United States." The newspaper also stated that Turkey's military strength has greatly increased, and U.S. aid is the main reason.

### Draft Indian Constitution Announced; Full Text Draws on British and American Constitutions; Future Relationship with the United Kingdom Still Undecided

[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] The draft Indian Constitution was announced today. The future relationship between the Dominion of India and the British Commonwealth is still undecided in the draft Constitution. The full text is 214 pages long, with 18 chapters and 315 articles. It is based on the British Commonwealth system and the British Constitution, and adopts some points from the U.S. Constitution.

The draft Constitution stipulates the establishment of a President and Vice President, each with a term of five years. They will be elected by an electoral commission composed of members of both houses of Parliament and members of the State Legislative Assemblies. The President may be re-elected for a maximum of one term. The President may appoint the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers. The two houses of Parliament are named the Federal Assembly and the People's Assembly, respectively. The former has 250 members, of whom 15 are appointed by the President and the remainder are elected by the states. The People's Assembly, or Lower House, is directly elected by the people. The Constitution also guarantees the people's freedom of justice, society, economy, politics, thought, prayer, and belief, as well as equality of status and opportunity. The caste system and all titles are abolished. Discrimination based on religion, race, or gender is prohibited. Child labor and forced labor are prohibited. The Constitution also stipulates that a compulsory education system will be completed within ten years. In terms of the judiciary, the Constitution provides for a Supreme Court, with one Chief Justice and at least seven judges. State Legislative Assemblies are also divided into two houses: a Legislative Assembly and a Senate. However, smaller states have only one house. Each state is also represented by a Governor appointed by the central government.

### Fire Breaks Out Next Door to Japanese Prime Minister's Official Residence

Cabinet Formation Talks May Be Affected

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] A fire broke out in the official residence of the Japanese Prime Minister this afternoon. Five adjacent buildings were reduced to ashes. The fire also spread to the Prime Minister's official residence. The place where the fire started was only a narrow alley away from the Prime Minister's official residence. The wind helped the fire, and flames have already reached the gate of the official residence. The garage also caught fire. Thick smoke rose from the official residence and sparks flew everywhere. The situation was still dangerous after more than an hour. Hundreds of firefighters are doing their best to prevent the fire from spreading to the Prime Minister's official residence. The losses are estimated to be over millions of yen. Yoshimi Komeda, Secretary-General of the Democratic Party, told reporters at the Cabinet Formation Headquarters, which was shrouded in smoke at the Prime Minister's official residence, that political negotiations will be delayed due to the fire.

Let Us Drink to the Meeting of Allied Forces in Berlin

After meeting Stalin, a meeting was held immediately. During the break, I insisted on talking to Molotov and reiterated the arguments I had presented to Stalin regarding a meeting of the leaders of the three nations in Basra. Molotov asked me what should be resolved now in the plan for international cooperation I mentioned. I repeated many suggestions to him, suggestions I had made more than once since my arrival in Moscow.

Molotov said that an agreement should be reached regarding these plans. After thinking for a moment, he suddenly said:

"Isolation is almost something your country has discarded, isn't it, Mr. Secretary of State?"

I replied, "Yes, indeed. And isolation is almost something your country has discarded, isn't it, Mr. Minister?"

Molotov smiled and admitted that it was indeed so.

I said, "After the war, if you wish, you can follow isolationism and swallow up your neighbors. But you will abandon this approach. When I was young, I knew a bully in Tennessee. He often used his bullying to strong-arm others and gain something, but in the end, he had no friends in the world."

On October 28th, the President notified me that he expected to travel to North Africa soon and would have to leave Washington on November 9th. (This was to attend the Roosevelt-Churchill-Chiang Kai-shek conference in Cairo). He said he hoped I would keep my original plan, which was to return to the country on November 7th, because he and I had to talk before he left.

He suggested that if Stalin thought it impossible to meet with him, the Marshal should at least fly as far as Basra for one day. This was extremely important. For the rest of the time, the President hoped that Stalin could let Molotov attend, and hold meetings with Churchill and him.

The next day, I replied to the President that I was staying in Moscow longer than expected and would be happy to meet him on the east coast of the Atlantic. I said that Stalin was unlikely to go further than Tehran, and this indication was becoming more and more obvious, and I doubted whether Molotov would be sent as a substitute, because he was not a military man.

Two days later, I telegraphed the President that four of our group had contracted malignant malaria on the way to Moscow and could not return, so I thought it was not advisable to come to North Africa to wait for him, exposing myself to malaria, dysentery and similar diseases, because I had not been immunized. The President agreed to postpone the trip and meet me in the United States. So I telegraphed again, saying that I would fly back to the United States via the Pacific Ocean, instead of taking a cruiser.

The Catherine Hall in the Kremlin was the venue for the banquet hosted by Marshal Stalin for the delegation on the last day of the conference - the night of October 30th. This was my first social event since attending the conference.

As soon as I arrived in Moscow, I told Molotov that, given my health, I could not attend to social activities and work at the same time. At first, he didn't seem to believe me, and kept inviting me to see plays and attend banquets. When I firmly refused, he seemed quite touched. Later, someone told me that this made him believe in the sincerity of my purpose, because I had traveled to Moscow despite my poor health in order to help lay the foundation for a better post-war world.

I sat to Stalin's right. This gave me an excellent opportunity to talk to him for a long time during the meal and entertainment. I tried to use it to discuss our current and future relations, knowing that this was my last chance before leaving Moscow. I somewhat indirectly induced him to express his opinions.

Stalin was in a very good mood. No matter what topic was discussed, he seemed to take it into account and try to make me more aware of his current and future position. At the beginning of the conversation, he said, "You have had a successful meeting." I immediately replied that everything should be attributed to him, and said that he had approved his great country to take decisive steps to join a world plan based on cooperation with Britain and the United States. This seemed to please him very much. Throughout the conversation, he expressed unconditional support for broad international cooperation, including military, political and economic aspects, for the sake of peace.

I then presented to Stalin in the most forceful way possible the need for him to participate in the personal cooperation and leadership between the President and the Prime Minister. But on the point of meeting them in Basra, he firmly stated his conclusion, which was that he could not currently leave his tense military situation. He said we should believe that he was very sincere about this.

He then said that he could send Molotov to replace him, because under Soviet law, he was really the second person in the government and could take his place in his absence. He asked me what I thought of this idea.

I immediately replied that, of course, if he felt he absolutely couldn't go, then Molotov would be a good representative. But in the minds of the President and myself, the whole point was that if Stalin himself could go, it would have a profound psychological impact on the world. I said that if possible, I would still implore him to go himself.

I got nothing out of this. His conclusion seemed to be decided. I guessed that he had already discussed it with his advisors, and they felt that the military situation, or the needs of the conference, had not yet reached the point where he could leave. I decided not to urge him on this point any further, because doing so would not only be useless, but would also harm our purpose.

But then he made an extremely important statement. He clearly and unequivocally stated that when the Allied forces defeated Germany, the Soviet Union would participate in defeating Japan, which surprised me very much.

Stalin raised this topic entirely of his own accord, although he may have remembered my conversation with Ambassador Litvinov on this topic. He finally said that I could inform President Roosevelt of this very confidentially. I expressed my heartfelt thanks to him.

The Marshal's explanation of his determination was very straightforward. He said it very forcefully, not at all out of someone's plea, and he did not ask for any thanks.

At the Yalta Conference in 1943, Stalin provided the President with the same promise in writing, but at that time it was after the President agreed to make many territorial concessions to the Soviet Union in Asia, including the Kuril Islands and part of Sakhalin Island. I had resigned in November 1944, so I don't know what changes in the situation may have made these concessions necessary - but when Stalin offered me the promise to convey to the President, it was without any hesitation.

During the meal, toasts were repeatedly raised. Stalin and I drank red wine, while many guests preferred to drink vodka. Our military attaché in Moscow, Major General Deane, was the focus of attention. When he thanked Stalin for toasting the American armed forces, he suggested a toast to the day when British, American and Soviet troops would meet in Berlin. Stalin stood up from the chair next to me, went around the table to clink glasses with him, which was an honor only Deane received.

As we left the dining table, before going to another room to watch a movie, Stalin led me and two or three other people to a room next door for a few minutes. He began spontaneously, in the most satirical tone, to talk about the rumors that had circulated before about the possibility of a separate peace between the Soviet Union and Germany. I said that anyone who understood the Soviet people and their relationship with Germany in this war knew that they would not make a separate peace with Germany. He heartily agreed with this.

Our host then led us to watch a movie, which depicted the arduous battles fought by Red Army guerrillas in Siberia during the 1918 revolution to resist the perfidious Japanese. This film was made in 1938, and when it was publicly screened in Moscow, it aroused a strong protest from the Japanese ambassador. Now, there was no attempt to hide the purpose of choosing this film, and it had a double meaning, especially after Stalin had just told me that the Soviet Union would participate in the war against Japan.

After the movie, there was a concert, and I didn't leave until the end, which was around 2 a.m. - although we were scheduled to take off at 5 a.m. to return home. The concert was performed by the most famous Soviet musicians, and Stalin seemed quite pleased that I stayed there from beginning to end.

When we said goodbye, I was deeply impressed by Stalin. After saying some usual farewell words, he shook hands with me and said "Goodbye" in Russian. Then he walked away from me for three or four steps, suddenly turned back and shook hands with me a second time, for quite a long time, but without saying a word. I thought to myself that any American who had Stalin's personality and way of dealing with people could also achieve a very high position in my own country.

After I returned to the embassy, I sent two telegrams to the President. I thought that Stalin's determination about Japan was so confidential that I sent half of it to the President using naval code and the other half using army code. Because I believed that the British Foreign Office sometimes leaked important information more easily than I thought it should, I let the President convey this message to Churchill himself.

Regarding the planned Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin conference, I notified the President that Stalin clearly agreed 100% in words and deeds with this new trend of international cooperation in every aspect, which had been indicated in the Four-Nation Declaration, but at the same time, he was currently unwilling to give in on meeting with the President and the Prime Minister outside of Tehran. Because of the continuing stalemate between the President and Stalin, I wanted to make Mr. Roosevelt's mind more inclined to Tehran, because I believed that Stalin would not go to Basra. After considerable consideration, the President agreed.

As I flew back home, I felt deeply that major achievements had been made in Moscow. We had agreed to establish an international organization, which later became the United Nations. The Soviet Union agreed to become a member of this organization and cooperate closely with Western countries in many other aspects. We reached agreements on policies towards Italy and Austria. We had established the European Advisory Commission and the Italian Advisory Commission. We had exchanged many views on how to deal with Germany after the war, the attitude towards France, and the economic policies that should be followed after the war. In addition, outside of the conference, Stalin also agreed that once Hitler was defeated, the Soviet Union would participate in the war against Japan.

Furthermore, the Soviet Union had never mentioned the issue of resolving post-war borders, which had greatly troubled us in the past year.

We flew back to our country via Tehran, Cairo, Algiers, Marrakesh, Dakar, Fortalaleza (Brazil) and Buturiko, without any accidents along the way. When we approached Brazil, we encountered a tropical cyclone, and after two hours of extremely uncomfortable flight, several of us were quite embarrassed, but it didn't seem to affect me. Whenever we stopped, I exchanged telegrams with the President, and was very happy to learn that he had decided to meet with Stalin in Tehran.

When we arrived at Washington Airport on November 10th, the President was there to welcome us. He was accompanied by a congressional delegation.

On the way to the White House and in the conversation the next morning, I told the President about the important matters of the Moscow conference. He was more interested in discussing the upcoming Cairo and Tehran conferences. He seemed to look forward to meeting with Stalin with the fervor of a child, and particularly earnestly asked me to tell him about my personal impressions of the Marshal. A few hours later, the President set off for these two historic conferences.

### Blitz Operation Cracks Down on Foreign Exchange Black Market Organization, Seizing Forty-One Businesses and Arresting Fifty-Eight People, Many Prominent Guangdong-Chaozhou Speculation Tycoons

[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal authorities and financial management authorities, acting on secret orders from the highest authorities, together with the administrative office of the municipal police department, the economic police and the Flying Fortress, in forty-six groups, took swift action yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m. to search and arrest the organizers and major speculators secretly operating black market gold, banknotes, and foreign exchange organizations throughout the city. By 5:00 p.m., fifty-eight people had been detained, many of whom were prominent Guangdong-Chaozhou tycoons. The trading funds seized and frozen amounted to an initial estimate of over three thousand yuan. According to the person in charge of planning this operation, who spoke to reporters yesterday: Since the city cracked down on the main black market gold banknote organization on the ninth of last month, the market situation had stabilized for a time. However, during the Lunar New Year, some speculative elements became active again, setting up private radio stations and secretly engaging in black market foreign exchange and gold banknote transactions. It was then decided to send personnel to infiltrate their secret organization to record their transactions at any time. As of recently, it has been found that there are as many as four hundred such firms in the city. Their operating methods are mainly based on Hong Kong currency. When the Hong Kong currency decreases, gold banknotes increase, and prices also increase. When gold banknotes and prices increase together, the Hong Kong currency follows suit and increases again, returning to the path of the Hong Kong currency decreasing again, cyclical manipulation, causing prices to skyrocket. The information was immediately secretly reported to the highest authorities for instructions, and at the same time, the second phase of action began, which was to investigate the most important of these four hundred firms, a total of forty-one firms. The daily Hong Kong currency, black market transactions, and stock transactions involve amounts ranging from 4.5 billion to 230 billion legal tender. Subsequently, a secret order was obtained from the highest authorities, and action was taken yesterday to arrest the organizers of these forty-one firms, who are also the troublemakers in the gold banknote and stock markets, totaling fifty-eight people (list attached). It is possible to enter the next step from today onwards, and gradually investigate the remaining three hundred firms. All the suspects are currently detained by the city police department, and the economic section of the administrative office is responsible for interrogating them overnight, and the seized account books are also being reviewed by the section in groups to ensure that no one is wrongly accused or let go. All large checks and gold banknotes have been handed over to the Financial Management Bureau for processing. When the city police department began the arrests, the market was rising sharply due to various rumors, but after the organizers of the black market firms were caught in the afternoon, the market situation changed, and the black market Hong Kong currency disappeared after 4:00 p.m.

Talk by the Director of the Financial Management Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Management Bureau of this city, made the following statement to the press at the Central Bank at 6:00 p.m. yesterday: Recently, the black market for gold banknotes in this city has shown fluctuations again. The reasons are: (1) Due to the sharp rise in daily necessities such as rice and cotton cloth. (2) The repeated surge in telegraphic transfers shows that funds are fleeing from this city to Hong Kong, and that someone in this city is constantly speculating on Hong Kong currency. According to the investigation of this bureau, there are many institutions in this city that operate Hong Kong currency, similar to the Minye Bureau in Guangzhou. Most of them use the names of companies and firms as attachment, set up private radio stations, and use codes to transmit daily transaction flows and market fluctuations, and contact Hong Kong. The Central Bank has long investigated these firms and personnel engaged in black market Hong Kong currency. After the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau, more close attention was paid to them. Based on code searches, the bureau separately intercepted and recorded the incoming and outgoing communications. More than forty of the largest and most influential firms have been identified, and detailed lists, addresses, telephone numbers, etc. have been sent to the Municipal Police Department for a comprehensive search starting today (26th). From a financial point of view, the recent fluctuations in commodity prices in Shanghai are actually the result of the influx of funds and cash into Shanghai. According to past experience, commodity prices in this city inevitably fluctuate around the New Year and the Lunar New Year. This is due to: (1) More withdrawals by military and government agencies. (2) More business remittances. The National Bank is paying close attention to the flow of funds to Shanghai and is trying to find a way out for the funds. In the past ten days, the National Bank has injected an average of 300 billion yuan into the money market every day, so the money market has become tighter, which is helpful in stabilizing commodity prices. However, the recent fluctuations in commodity prices are mostly cyclical, and after this cyclical period, commodity prices can return to stability.

Orders to Suspend the Business of More Than Ten Securities Firms

[Also reported] The commissioners of the Exchange Supervisor's Office have separately investigated and found more than thirty illegal firms on Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Central Road, and in major buildings. The office has sent letters to the police department to order them to suspend their business. Among them, more than ten firms are suspected of violating the Exchange Law and have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning. According to Article 53 of the Exchange Law, those who engage in buying and selling can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year.

### Director Wu Appeals to the City Council: Two Major Crises Require Immediate Solutions - Most Factories Will Be Unable to Sustain Themselves - Failing to Aid Refugees Will Create Security Problems

[Our Own Report] The fifth session's fourth meeting of the City Council was convened yesterday afternoon. First, Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau answered questions from the previous day's meeting regarding inquiries to the Public Utilities Bureau, and then Director Zhao responded. The fourth meeting's agenda then commenced with work reports from the heads of the Civil Affairs, Police Affairs, and Social Affairs Bureaus. District chiefs and two representatives from the District People's Congresses attended to report. The question and answer session for the Civil, Police, and Social Affairs Bureaus must be postponed until next Monday (March 1st). This morning and tomorrow morning from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and afternoon from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM will be dedicated to review sessions for each group.

During yesterday's meeting, when Social Affairs Director Wu Kaixian reported on his administration, in addition to explaining the main points, he urgently appealed, presenting two major pressing issues for the City Council to consider: (1) Due to price fluctuations, many factories will inevitably be unable to sustain themselves this year, leading to worker unemployment, which is a matter of utmost concern. (2) Refugee shelters currently house over 5,000 people, and tens of thousands more receive assistance. The winter relief effort is scheduled to end on April 15th, but based on the circumstances, it cannot be terminated. If continued relief efforts are not devised for the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Shanghai, security problems will certainly arise. Director Wu particularly emphasized the severity of these two major crises, urging the City Council to quickly find a solution.

The comprehensive administration report included: (1) Food Administration: Last year, rice prices fluctuated, experiencing a sudden surge in December, which was unexpected. Logically, with the establishment of the new marketplace, there should have been no fluctuations, but the main reason was insufficient military rice. After requesting the Ministry of Food to stop purchasing military rice, the price, once raised, did not easily decrease. Previously, fluctuations were suppressed by releasing rice into the market, but this year the situation is different. The price in rice-producing areas is high, so releasing rice had limited effect. As for the comprehensive rationing plan for this year, half will be supplied by the US Aid to China Association, with the Ministry of Food and the municipal government each bearing one-quarter. This way, each person can be allocated two *dou* of rice per month, resolving the issue. The source of rice for the city was from purchases made in Wuhu, Hankou, Wuxi, Songjiang, and other places starting in late November last year, which were then stored in preparation. The reason why US rice cannot be priced too low is that the proceeds from the rice sales will be used for relief efforts. Also, Americans are aware of the "scalpers" in China; if the price is too low, scalpers will emerge and buy up the rice. The decision to implement rice rationing on March 1st means that, while the price may only seem 5% cheaper on that day, it will be much more cost-effective by the end of March. (2) The purpose of establishing the People's Food Allocation Committee is to reduce the burden on the market and prevent the cost of living index from rising due to high rice prices. From June to the end of last year, a total of 700,000 *dan* of rice were allocated to vocational workers, industrial workers, students, civilians, and the United States. Workers' rice accounted for only 241,000 *dan*, and civilian rice for 161,000 *dan*. Starting in September, coal briquettes were also distributed, with a total of 610,000 *dan* distributed in two phases, and distribution is now starting again. Furthermore, in order to distribute oil, loans were borrowed from the Central Bank to purchase raw materials from Qingdao and other places to avoid affecting prices in the city. The government incurred losses of 50 trillion on rice distribution, and the oil funds were personally borrowed from the Central Bank, with debts reaching 680 billion. From the government's standpoint, this can be considered as doing right by the people. (3) Labor Administration: Advocates for promoting labor welfare to eliminate class struggle. The establishment of cooperatives in factories has achieved considerable success, but it is still insufficient and must be promoted as much as possible. (4) Relief Efforts: It is planned to greatly expand these efforts this year, with funding allocated from the US rice funds. The proceeds from the sale of US rice could reach 4 trillion, of which 2.5 trillion is designated for social economy and 2.5 trillion for health and relief. Shanghai's request for several hundred billion should not be a problem.

### Automatic Adjustment of Public Utility Prices Becomes Focus of Councilors' Inquiries - Doubts Regarding Gas and Electricity Fines and Custodial Procedures - Director Zhao Provides Point-by-Point Explanations to the Assembly

Among the City Councilors' inquiries to the various municipal bureaus yesterday, those directed at the Public Utilities Bureau were the most intense. The aspects most opposed by the councilors were: (1) The repeated price increases of public utilities, making it impossible for citizens to afford. (2) Fines for conserving electricity and gas, and overcharges for telephone service. Zhou Xiangsheng first asked the Public Utilities Bureau about the large fines for electricity usage, what their purpose was, and whether they could be refunded. If not, it would be best to use them for relief efforts. Chen Weijian said that the transfer and licensing of automobiles should continue. Zhu Wende stated that in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, residents paid for the installation of electric poles and wires, so why had electricity not been restored yet? Fei Shusheng's criticism of Director Zhao was the most severe. In addition to a written inquiry of approximately 5,000 words, he also made verbal inquiries. The main points were: (1) The "automatic adjustment" of public utility prices affects the cost of living index, placing an excessive burden on citizens. (2) Fines and overcharges for conserving electricity are alarming and should be canceled. Furthermore, are the custodial procedures for the fines clear? A resolution was passed to relax electricity restrictions for schools and hospitals, so why has it not been implemented? (3) Why has a formal public transportation company not been established yet? The highest price for a public bus is 14,000 yuan, which is considerable for civil servants who live far away and must pay daily bus fares. In addition, he raised issues regarding the shady dealings in telephone installations and transfers, the extortion during vehicle licensing, and the forced sale of power-consuming appliances. Lu Huimin asked why electricity charges varied among different companies. Jia Dechao stated, (1) Electricity fines have never been handed over to the treasury, why? (2) *Yejiche* public transportation fares are much lower than public bus fares, indicating that the bus fare increases are unreasonable. Zhou Qize asked whether it would be possible to consider opening up a portion of trishaw licenses, which are being sold on the black market for 20-30 million yuan each. Fan Shouyuan stated that electricity restrictions for hospitals and doctors had not been relaxed, and listed specific instances. Qian Songping said that the Zhenru Electric Power Company has been out of service for several years and its contract should be canceled. Li Shuzi requested streetlights be installed on Zhenru Chaoyang Road. Zhao Yangxiong stated that there is a shortage of electricity in South Shanghai, and what is the status of the agreement between the Chinese-owned Electric Company and the Resources Committee to move back the generators? In addition, Zhang Zhihan, Qu Yue, Zhu Fu Jiu and others also raised questions.

### Billions of Fines in Doubt - Clear Purpose

Director Zhao Zukang responded to each point: (1) Over 110 billion in fines have already been collected, and it is estimated that 260 billion can be collected by the end of February. Refunds are impossible. The use of the funds will be decided by the Custodial Committee organized by your council, with 70% allocated for installing streetlights and 30% for subsidizing factories that generate their own electricity. If other uses are proposed, they can be passed by the assembly and submitted to the Custodial Committee for distribution. (2) He has requested the Executive Yuan to further relax the automobile transfer policy, but there has been no response. (3) The restoration of electricity to Gaoqiao Town in Pudong has been delegated to the Pudong Electric Company for planning. (4) Regarding Councilor Fei's inquiry, concerning (A) "automatic adjustment," it is actually not automatic, nor was it created here. It is a calculation formula devised by the National Economic Council that combines foreign exchange, oil prices, the cost of living index, and coal prices. The application is very careful, and the company uses this as a basis for calculation, but the municipal government reduces it by 20% to 30% each time, and there are detailed records for each adjustment. (B) The salaries of each company are approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The salaries of foreign employees are based on contracts. (C) Public school teachers and staff have monthly passes. Public buses are only 300,000 yuan per month. Some schools and hospitals register electricity under private names, so they are unaware. All those who register are granted the relaxation. (D) The original hope was to organize a joint company for public transportation, and discussions are underway with various companies. Furthermore, the current vehicles are not formal vehicles, and foreign exchange must be requested to purchase formal vehicles, which has caused delays. (E) Power consumption devices are required by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to prevent damage to generators.

### Civil Affairs Director Expresses Anxiety About Handling District *Baojia* and Military Service

Civil Affairs Director Zhang Xiaosong reported: He stated that the biggest difficulty in handling district *baojia* work and military service work is funding. After the rationing system is strengthened, district protection work will become even more burdensome, while funding and personnel are lacking. Regarding rationed items, previously, children under the age of 14 were not issued national identity cards, but now they must all be issued cards to receive small-sized items, which is also a considerable task. Regarding conscription, although 3,000 volunteers were recruited last year, the difficulties with family allowances are indescribable. The government only provided 50,000 yuan per person, but fortunately, the Military Service Association borrowed 12 billion from the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, allowing each family to receive 4 million yuan, but 4.5 billion is still outstanding. This year, the city's conscription quota has increased to 6,000, but all expenses must be raised by the local government. This amount, estimated at 100 billion, raises the question of how to raise it and where to obtain it, which is another cause for anxiety.

### Hope for Reporting Black Market Telephones

(F) Regarding the black market for telephones, the company has caught several employees extorting money and they have all been fired. It is hoped that reports will be made so that they can be severely punished. Employees who demand money for vehicle licensing have also been fired and over ten people have been sent to court. (5) Preferential monthly pass arrangements for journalists are being drafted. (6) Overcharges for telephone service are being reduced each time. (7) The reason why the fees for each company are not uniform is because the equipment costs of each company are different. (8) All fines are handed over to the city treasury and are auditable. Fees from the previous month are submitted on the 15th of each month. *Yejiche* transport vehicles are simple and charge lower fees because they are a quick profit venture, so they should be cracked down on. The Director also stated that he had already resigned from the Mayor's office, hoping that a more capable person would take over, so that others would have the opportunity to try. (9) If trishaw licenses are opened again, it will be even more difficult to maintain traffic in the central district. (10) Zhenru Electric Company has three months to resume operations, otherwise the Zhabei Electric Power Company will take over. (11) The South Shanghai Chinese-owned Electric Company has a 4,000-kilowatt machine from the Executive Yuan that will be transported there, and the Resources Committee cannot return it. Regarding other issues that require detailed answers, due to time constraints, the speaker requested that Director Zhao provide written answers.

### Mayor and Director Report: Citywide Rice Rationing to Begin on March 1st - Price Not to Exceed 2.25 Million per *Shi*

[Our Own Report] Mayor Wu and Social Affairs Director Wu Kaixian reported two pieces of news to reporters during a break in yesterday afternoon's City Council meeting: (1) The police, in conjunction with the Gold Control Bureau, uncovered secret telegram communications and 41 organizations operating a black market for gold and banknotes, and arrested a large number of people. As of yesterday afternoon, there was no longer a black market for gold and banknotes. (2) Regarding the issue of citywide rice rationing, it was decided that rationing would begin on March 1st. Ration cards will be issued to district offices today, and rice will be issued tomorrow. Citizens can collect rice from March 1st to 4th. The rationing price will not exceed 2.25 million yuan per *shi*, which is approximately 95% of the average price for the last five days of February. The price of rice will not change within the one-month period from March 1st to March 31st. The rationed rice is American *xian* rice. Furthermore, the Social Affairs Bureau will continue to release rice until the end of the month, releasing 13,000 *dan* per day. The price is also 2.25 million yuan per *shi*.

### Archbishop Li Hosted a Banquet for Mayor Wu Yesterday

### Wife of the Speaker Does Not Dare Take Credit - Did Not Donate Towels to the No. 3 Bi Han Asylum

[Our Own Report] This reporter met with Mrs. Tang Guanyu, wife of Speaker Shen, yesterday. According to her, the statement in yesterday's newspaper by children at the No. 3 Bi Han Asylum that the towels were donated by her may be a misreport. Although she donated steamed buns once after visiting the asylum before the Spring Festival, and also donated vegetables once to refugees at the Jiangwan Gongzhen Asylum, she did not donate towels and does not dare to take credit.

Chairman Jiang Zhaohu of the District People's Congress Delivers an Enthusiastic Speech (Photo by This Newspaper)

### Speeches by District Chiefs and District People's Representatives Arouse Applause from the Assembly

Before adjourning yesterday's City Council meeting, Mr. Qiu Xisheng, Deputy District Chief of the North Sichuan Road District, and Jiang Zhaohu of Huangpu District, representatives of the 30 district chiefs and representatives of the District People's Congress of this city, were invited to present reports. The sincerity of their words aroused unanimous applause from the assembly. First, Ms. Qiu reported that the work of the district office is not limited to household registration surveys, but includes many important tasks such as sanitation, epidemic prevention and disinfection, security and fire protection, education, social relief, and distribution of goods, all of which are assisted by district protection. However, the outside world does not understand district protection. The most difficult aspect of the work is the lack of funds and personnel. The district office's budget for January was 5 million, while water and electricity expenses alone were over 8 million. Each *bao* only has one *bao* staff member, who is responsible for everything from household surveys to delivering letters from far and near. The *baozhang* has another job, so people often go to the *bao* office and are dissatisfied because no one is there to handle things. District protection offices in urban areas are often conveniently located in commercial establishments, but in suburban areas, they rely entirely on one staff member. Therefore, she made several minimum requirements on behalf of all districts: (1) Increase operating funds. (2) Please add at least one *baoding* (security guard) per *bao* in the municipal budget. (3) Please find a way to resolve the issue of district office buildings. (4) *Baotianzhang* (field leaders) are very difficult to hire, please provide them with protection. Next, Jiang Zhaohu delivered a speech, stating that councilors are produced from the district people, just like a daughter getting married, and must bring the opinions of her mother's family to her husband's family. Millions of citizens have high expectations for you, and hope that you will not disappoint the masses. Reviewing the past four meetings, how many cases have the city government actually implemented? If only one-tenth has been implemented, then the City Council has become a mere ornament. He heard that your council is discussing emergency measures to suppress current prices and hopes for success. Public utility price increases and rent based on the index standard are all increasing the burden on citizens and cannot be arbitrarily passed. He asked the City Council to make simple, clear, and effective proposals, and all the district people in the city will support you. The speaker expressed his gratitude to the two of them.

### Ping-Hu Air Smuggling Drug Case: Li Jianfei and Mai Changde Each Sentenced to Death - Mai Renfa to Life Imprisonment - Five Other Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Our Own Report] In the major Ping-Hu air smuggling drug case involving the seizure of over 90 catties of morphine, Judge Shen Tianbao of the District Court delivered the verdict yesterday afternoon: Li Jianfei, who impersonated a colonel, and Mai Changde (also known as Hai Yuyun), the drug kingpin, were found guilty of jointly transporting and selling drugs and sentenced to death. Mai Renfa was found guilty of jointly transporting and selling drugs and sentenced to life imprisonment. Bu Longfu was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Ma 義 was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Danqing and Mai Lizhi were each sentenced to 12 years in prison. Chen Jixi was found guilty of assisting in transporting drugs and sentenced to 6 years in prison. The remaining 15 defendants, including Kong Fanzhen and Mai Jinbao, were acquitted. Li appeared calm during the sentencing, having already removed his military uniform and wearing an overcoat. Mai Changde and Mai Renfa's expressions changed drastically after hearing the sentence, and family members in the audience burst into tears. All defendants who were sentenced were remanded to custody, and the acquitted defendants were released on their original bail.

### Director of Public Works Bureau Continues to Answer Questions

Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang continued to answer questions from the third meeting: (1) The Pudong Avenue will be completed by the end of April. The construction of the Pudong Avenue bridge is quite expensive and difficult to manage. Therefore, it is hoped that a portion of the increase in automotive municipal construction taxes will be used for bridge construction. (2) The cost of the Zhongshan West Road project is extremely high. At the same time, there were indeed perfunctory repairs due to insufficient coal supply. If any are found, please report them immediately, and the responsible engineer will be disciplined. (3) The construction cost of Guihua Road is 1.8 billion, which has not been done due to limited funds. Now that local people are willing to bear the costs and cooperate, it will be accepted. (4) The estimated construction cost of the north-south main road in the Longhua District is 26 billion. Repairing the northern section alone will require 10 billion. (5) For the requisition of private land in Pudong for road construction, funds have been allocated to the company responsible for paying back the land price. It will be supervised and managed again. (6) Bottle-neck style houses must be demolished once the road system plan is completed.

### Police Quality Improved, Crime Solving Efficiency Increased

Police Chief Yu Shuping reported on his work, the main points of which were that, in terms of public security, due to the improved quality of the police force, the knowledge and skills of criminal police officers, and household registration surveys, the efficiency of crime solving has increased. At the same time, the number of criminal cases has decreased sharply. From September last year to January this year, there were 90 cases of black market gold and banknotes, 13 cases of private foreign exchange schemes, 17 cases of underground banks, and 6 cases of private radio stations. Regarding cases of hoarding and speculation, there were 5 cases of food hoarding, 5 cases of coal hoarding, 4 cases of oil hoarding, 8 cases of cotton cloth hoarding, 11 cases of wool hoarding, 22 cases of paper hoarding, and 8 other cases. In addition, various tasks such as transportation, opium prohibition, public morals, city appearance, foreign affairs, fire protection, and organization have been improved compared to the past.

### Discussion on Suppressing Prices to Continue Today

The special review committee on suppressing prices and adopting effective measures held its first meeting yesterday. Mayor Wu, Wu Kaixian, Zhao Zengjue, Min Xiangfan, Zhang Rentao, Yu Shuping, Tian Yongqian, Yuan Liang, Ren Xianqun, Li Lixia, Huo Baoshu representatives, as well as Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, councilors, etc., attended. The discussion was long, and because several issues still need to be further studied, there were no results yesterday. Another meeting will be held this morning.

### Construction Industry Hopes for Government Assistance to Jointly Solve the Housing Shortage Problem

[Our Own Report] The National Federation of Construction Industry Associations hosted a reception for the local press at the Merchants Steam Navigation Company Building yesterday at 6:00 PM. Tao Guilin, Chairman of the Association, and Directors Zhang Jiguang and Wang Ziyang, delivered speeches stating that the housing shortage problem is becoming increasingly serious, and the facts are: (1) The construction rate is lower than the depreciation rate. (2) With rising prices, the lump-sum contract system in the construction industry is particularly disadvantageous. (3) The government provides assistance to general industries, but the construction industry has not received any loans. In order to solve the current housing shortage problem, the construction industry is willing to do its best (such as the recently purchased houses in Shanghai, which were designed and built by the construction industry on a voluntary basis). However, it also hopes that the government authorities will provide assistance to reduce the threat of housing shortages.

### Jin Houcheng Advocates Frugality: No Celebrations for Those Under Sixty

Jin Houcheng of Baoshan, in view of the fact that birthday celebrations originate from inferior customs, and as customs have gradually spread, they not only waste large sums of money but also waste labor. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining and wounds have not yet healed, there should be regulations in line with the government's advocacy of frugality. Therefore, he initiated a rule that only those over sixty years old are allowed to hold birthday celebrations, and imitating the Westerners' chain of happiness, he sent letters to various relatives and friends to support the cause. The main points of the original letter are as follows: (abridged) Now it is proposed that only those over sixty years of age who have completed the *huajia* can hold birthday celebrations. All others should be simple, without gathering friends, without serving wine and food, without giving gifts, and without writing articles. Except for family banquets for close relatives and blood relatives that cannot be avoided due to human feelings, all should be stopped, with the hope that among relatives and friends, they will agree and abide by this principle, so that there will be no risk of error and the atmosphere of advocacy will be revived. Emotion and reason are both integrated, and there is no better way. Imitating the Westerners' chain of happiness and with the approval of my wife, I am sending this letter to you, and I hope that you will grant your favor and also obtain the consent of your wife, and within three days, copy this letter three times and send it to three friends, and send another letter to the sender to support the cause and promote it in advance. I am extremely fortunate."

### Civilization, Friendship, Morality

— Second Letter Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

[This newspaper's Brussels Capital City 16th Dispatch] The Belgian Congo colony in Africa is the cornerstone of Belgium's prosperity today. The decline of European hegemony after World War II led the British Empire to relax its grip on India and Burma, France to be unable to restrain Vietnam, and the Dutch kingdom to be troubled by the war in Indonesia, but Belgium alone was free from these troubles. During World War II, the Belgian king was captured by the Nazis, but the Belgian government in exile in London still controlled the Congo colony, using Congolese manpower and resources as capital for national restoration. In particular, the mining of uranium in the Congo became the main raw material for the later American manufacturing of atomic bombs. When I was in the United States last year, a Belgian friend told me that the Belgian government used the raw materials of uranium ore to repay the American "Lend-Lease Act," and the international friendship and commercial exchanges between the United States and Belgium after the war were much better than the relationship between the United States and Finland after the first war. (Note: Finland is the only country that fully repaid the American "war debt").

Congo Uranium Mine

Brussels is full of American goods and American movies. In addition, the young Belgian men and women speak American English, which reminds people of the prosperity of New York and the factors that created this prosperity. I asked Mr. Was of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Press Office if he could tell me something about the initial mining of uranium ore in the Congo. He gave me more than a dozen books about the Congo colony, including the history of the Congo's development, the achievements of King Leopold II's management, the races of Congolese blacks, and their struggle against modern material civilization, and even the recent achievements of Belgian rule: five thousand schools, one million students, four thousand modern hospitals, clinics, and sanatoriums, three thousand two hundred miles of railways, and fifty thousand miles of highways. Mr. Fritchawer, Minister of the Colonial Department of the Belgian government, said: "Belgians govern colonies not only for unilateral interests... Helping the people of the colonies to enjoy the happiness of modern material civilization is the main principle of Belgian colonial policy."

However, in these books, there is no introduction to uranium mining. Mr. Was of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that uranium ore does exist, but the Belgian government is unwilling to announce it. "Because this is still a secret." He said: There are many foreign reporters in Brussels who often want to know about this issue, but there has been no response.

Economic Cooperation

There are many foreign reporters living in Brussels, but routine press conferences are rare. There are only two or three times a year, and press conferences are only held for more important events. The current Prime Minister Spaak, the former President of the United Nations General Assembly, is quite happy to meet reporters. During my stay in Brussels, he went to Luxembourg. Mr. Sevane, Spaak's confidential secretary, is the current head of the Press Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Acting Charge d'Affaires Qu Chunbo introduced me to visit him twice at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Laroie Street. He was with Prime Minister Spaak in Luxembourg.

Luxembourg is currently holding the Benelux economic cooperation plan. There is a new term popular in Europe now called "Benelux," which is a quick sketch of the country names of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. In the correspondence from the Netherlands, I mentioned Spaak's speech on the economic cooperation of the three countries. According to outsiders' estimates, if the economic units of the three countries form a whole, their total import and export trade can become the third largest in the world. In addition to the United States and the United Kingdom, it should be Benelux. At present, Belgian and Dutch newspapers are extremely excited about Benelux, and the editors of the newspapers attach even more importance to the economic cooperation between Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg than the Marshall Plan for European aid.

Foreign Minister Puxi

Because of the urgency of time, I did not go to Luxembourg to visit. In 1945, I met the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, Puxi, in Paris, an easy-going old man who made a lifelong career as a foreign minister, liked to tell jokes, and was never pessimistic or worried. I remember that he raised his thumb at that time, imitating China, and then extended the tip of his little finger: "That is our Luxembourg." He was also happy to talk about his friendship with Ambassador Gu Shaochuan, and the arrogance of Yosuke Matsuoka during the September 18th Incident, etc. That year, I visited Luxembourg. After more than two years of separation, I heard that Luxembourg's steel industry had recovered to the pre-war level. Like Belgium, they are both countries that export steel. The currency used in Luxembourg is the currency popular in Belgium. Embassies and legations of various countries in Belgium are also concurrently stationed in Luxembourg. It is said that China is the only exception.

Sino-Belgian Marriage

Belgium and Luxembourg are both very friendly to China. Among the 300,000 people in Luxembourg, there was once an unprecedented woman who married a Chinese husband. This was probably more than ten years ago. Foreign Minister Puxi told me in Paris in 1945. More Belgian women are married to Chinese. Mr. Lu Zhengxiang's deceased wife was Belgian. People at the embassy said that Mr. Lu Zhengxiang is doing well and is still doing his religious work. Because of the urgency of time, I did not go to the monastery to visit Mr. Lu.

Friends of China

Father Ding Guming, a Catholic messenger, followed Father Lebbe during the war to save the wounded in the war zone of North China as "Friends of China." Recently, he gave a quite wonderful public speech in Brussels, talking about the long-standing cultural foundation of China, the Chinese family system, and the stories of Chinese loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, which won much praise from Belgian society. Several hundred people attended the lecture that day, including the current Minister of Commerce, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the former Ambassador Ji Youmu. Father Ding Guming's Belgian name was originally called "Maidan." The three characters "Ding Guming" were taken after he came to China. Acting Charge d'Affaires Qu Chunbo concluded his speech by saying that Father Ding "knows China, understands China, and loves China." The audience applauded wildly.

No matter how difficult our national fortune is, with our moral tradition, we can find true friends who love China in any corner of the world. We must not lose our self-confidence. We have reason to be self-confident! (At the Gangtai Bi Hotel)

### Emergency Relief Society to Relieve the Subei Flood Area, Assist Spring Farming, and Eradicate Kala-Azar

[This newspaper Zhenjiang 25th Dispatch] In Subei, the Huai, Xu, and Hai prefectures and seventeen counties and cities suffered a major flood last autumn, with a vast disaster area and more than five million victims. The water receded in early winter, but because of the insecurity in some areas, the embankment restoration project in many places was difficult to start for a while, and the relief of the disaster area was also urgent. Therefore, in the autumn, the provincial government hired leaders from all walks of life to establish the Jiangsu Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Society to engage in fundraising work. On the one hand, it first selected areas where security was established to carry out work relief to restore the embankment, and on the other hand, it implemented emergency relief to provide emergency assistance to the victims. Now that the spring season has arrived, there are two major difficulties in the Huaibei disaster area that urgently need relief. One is to assist spring farming and relieve the spring famine, and the other is to treat the local epidemic of Kala-azar. This is the current urgent plan for post-disaster recovery. Since its establishment, the Jiangsu Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Society has raised a total of 13.662598445 billion yuan (including bank interest) in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang. The society held its fifth regular meeting in Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 19th. Decisions were made at the meeting regarding the above two urgent relief items. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) Organize a mobile inspection team immediately to inspect the relief situation. (2) Allocate 1 billion yuan for special relief to Xu prefecture. (3) Allocate 300 million yuan for Hai prefecture to relieve the spring famine. (4) Extend the work relief committee to the end of June this year. (5) Transfer 8,000 bags of flour and 10,000 pieces of fine cloth purchased and stored to the work relief committee for management, specifically for work relief projects. (6) After the Shanghai wheel industry donation arrives, first allocate 400 million yuan from the Subei Refugee Relief Association's special Kala-azar relief fund. (7) The spring famine in Xuhai is serious, and the people are unable to make a living. The association will send telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs, requesting that a large amount of funds be allocated from the US aid to China food procurement price and special relief donations to provide special emergency relief. (8) Adopt the principle of matching food when distributing work relief wages, and exchange the 8,000 bags of first-class flour purchased and stored for regular flour, and the 10,000 pieces of fine cloth for bean cakes, and transport them to the work sections for use. (9) Telegraph the counties in the disaster area to quickly guide the organization of agricultural loan institutions to actively promote agricultural loans. (10) Telegraph the China Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Treasury to discuss simplifying loan procedures for agricultural loans in the disaster area. (11) Transfer 6 billion yuan to relieve the spring famine in the flood area, and hand it over to the Social Affairs Office for planning and implementation.

### Two Thousand Female Workers in Changzhou Knock on the [Door of Survival]

[This newspaper Wujin 25th Dispatch] The Dacheng Yarn Factory No. 1 Factory, fine yarn room, outside the South Gate of this county, recently planned to recruit 16 trainee female workers. An examination was held at 8:00 am on the 22nd. Before the examination, no less than hundreds of letters of introduction from various relevant parties were received. Temporarily, more than 2,000 girls aged 18 or 19 from all over the city and countryside rushed to take the exam. For a time, the square in front of the factory and the vicinity of Dean Bridge formed a sea of people, with a crowded mass of heads. The factory officials deeply felt that they could not cope with the situation. The prepared admission tickets, only two or three hundred, could not be distributed either. They had no choice but to go back and forth in the crowd to find those with relatively beautiful faces and dignified attitudes to issue admission tickets first. For a time, the voices were noisy, and the admission tickets were scrambled for, and the order was greatly disrupted. They had to quickly order the factory doors to be closed tightly and send police to maintain order. A small number of people who received admission tickets were put in batches to take the exam. The women outside the door were chattering all day and did not disperse until late at night, when they left unhappy. The factory continued the re-examination on the 23rd. It is a pity that the quota was only 16 people. This matter has aroused sighs of sympathy from the society, and everyone shouted "Life is difficult!" more than once.

### Encas Fails to Break Through; Hualian Wins by One Point; 38 to 36, a Two-Point Difference; Dagong Defeats Renyu in a One-Sided Match

Hualian, the perennial champion of the Basketball League, defeated Encas 38-36 by one point last night in an extremely tense and difficult situation. The 4,000 spectators who braved the rain to come to the gymnasium were in extreme suspense. In the last few minutes, Encas pressed very hard, and Hualian appeared exhausted, eventually leading to this situation. The unpredictability of the Western Qing troops was not unexpected. In the first half, Hualian connected smoothly and took the lead 19-10. In the second half, the Western Qing counterattacked, and the tense situation began when they scored three consecutive goals, narrowing the difference to three points. In the other two games, Dagong defeated Renyu 71-52, and Jiashen defeated Yanghang 73-35, both being one-sided matches.

Lao Bao's younger brother both scored, Hualian led 10-4. After Encas called a timeout, they committed numerous fouls, and Hualian made consecutive free throws, thus taking a 12-5 and 13-6 lead. The Western general E Kairoski replaced Bao Lai. At 17-8, Bao Lai re-entered the field, and both teams scored. Before long, the first half ended, with Hualian 19 and Encas 10.

### Second Half: Sudden Turbulence

After the half-time break, the teams were reorganized, and the lineups of both teams remained unchanged. Da Li scored with a two-handed shot, and Ao Chai Liao responded. Da Li pushed in under the basket, and Ge Pengqiqigu committed a foul and was penalized twice. Da Li missed one free throw, which was a great pity. Ao Chai Liao scored for the second time, Encas replaced Qu Li with Mahan, and Ao made both free throws, Zhenzhong responded. Ge Pengqiqigu was dismissed after committing five fouls, and Fleck was called in. The Encas team became more active, and E Kairoski, Ao Chai Liao, and Bao Lai scored three consecutive goals, chasing the score to 24-27. The situation suddenly became tense, and turbulence began. Chengzhang scored, V Kairoski retaliated, and the score was still three points apart. Encas's momentum increased, and they launched a breakthrough. They chased again to 29-31, narrowing the difference to two points and getting closer. Hualian responded calmly, Xuechong scored, the Western general scored two free throws. At 31-35, Qu Li scored again, Lao Bao made a free throw, Xuechong scored, Encas's Fleck broke through, Ah Di left the field after committing three fouls. When Ren Xiangcheng entered the field, there were only 30 seconds left. Bao Lai scored, taking the score to 38-36, narrowly defeating Encas and maintaining their unbeaten record. How dangerous!

The Score was 36-38, Ao Chai Liao, knowing that time was up, made a long shot, but it hit the board and bounced out. Fortunately, Bao Lai's second shot missed, and the bell rang for Hualian.

### Dagong Wields Its Power, Soundly Defeating Renyu

In the Dagong vs. Renyu match, Dagong's Tu Wenlong scored first with one hand, Huang Boling scored, and Wenlong made a free throw, putting Dagong ahead 5-0.

Zhongyi went straight in, Pengju scored with a long shot, and Zhongyi scored for the second time, bringing the score close to 10-15. Unfortunately, Wenhua and Boling scored again and again, and Dagong took the lead again 23-10. Renyu called a timeout, replacing Wang Huaiching with Yao Wenyu, but Dagong still controlled the game. The first half ended with Renyu trailing 27-39, behind by twelve points.

The game restarted, and Dagong's lineup remained unchanged. Renyu replaced Wu Xinyun with Wang Huaiching. Wenlong and Zhongqiang worked together, and Wenlong sneaked in under the basket.

At one point, there was a difference of 24 points, with the score at 64-38. Later, Dagong's Zhan Chen twisted his muscle, and Zhang Gengsheng replaced him.

### Central Trust Bureau Announces Procedures for Acquisition and Distribution of Imported Goods Arriving Without Licenses and with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau yesterday announced the complete procedures for applying for the acquisition and distribution of imported goods arriving without licenses and with self-provided foreign exchange, as follows:

Application Procedures

(1) If an importer wishes to sell the arrived goods to the government, they should immediately submit the bill of lading and other relevant documents, along with the import license application, to the Export-Import Control Committee in accordance with the prescribed procedures, applying for government acquisition. (2) After receiving the above application, the Export-Import Control Committee, after review, will issue an import license and directly send the license and bill of lading to the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau. The Acquisition Group, Distribution Group, Finance Group, and Transportation Group of the Purchasing Department will then handle the matter in sequence.

Acquisition Procedures

(1) Upon receiving the import license and its attachments transferred by the Export-Import Control Committee, the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau will immediately issue an acquisition notice letter directly to the original applicant (the importer). At the same time, two blank "Application for Acquisition by the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau" forms will be enclosed for use. (2) After receiving the acquisition notice from the Central Trust Bureau, the importer should promptly fill out the application for acquisition, along with all required documents, within two weeks, and personally deliver them to the Acquisition Group of the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau (Room 320, 3rd Floor). At the same time, the importer should obtain an application form for priority distribution and a "List of Contracts with Direct Users" from the Central Trust Bureau for completion. (3) Upon receiving the application for acquisition and all required attachments, the Acquisition Group of the Central Trust Bureau will immediately register the application and issue an "Acquisition Certificate" to the original importer for safekeeping. The Acquisition Certificate serves as a receipt for the acquired goods. In the future, it will be used to exchange for the approved special foreign currency deposit certificate. The acquisition procedure is thus completed.

Distribution Procedures

(1) After completing the acquisition procedures, the importer should promptly fill out the "Priority Purchase Application" within three weeks from the date of receiving the Acquisition Certificate, along with the direct user's order and ten copies of the list of contracts with direct users. The contract list should be stamped with the seal of certification from the trade association or a reputable firm in the same industry and submitted to the Distribution Group of the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau (Room 314, 3rd Floor) to apply for priority purchase. (2) After receiving the distribution application, the Central Trust Bureau will review it and, if it meets the requirements, approve the distribution and notify the original importer to complete the distribution procedures. The original importer will then, based on the notification, go to the Central Trust Bureau to sign a contract and find two reputable shop guarantors to sign and guarantee the contract.

Payment Procedures

To be handled at the Finance Group of the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau (Room 314, 3rd Floor). (1) The payment for the purchased goods can be made in three installments. (A) 25% to be paid in cash on the date of signing the priority distribution contract. (B) 25% as a 30-day commercial acceptance draft. (C) 50% as a 45-day commercial acceptance draft. When paying the 25% cash, the entire amount can be settled according to the foreign exchange listing rate of the day.

Procedures for Obtaining the Bill of Lading

To be handled at the Storage and Transportation Group of the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau (Storage and Transportation Office on the First Floor). (1) After completing the payment procedures, the Central Trust Bureau will issue a letter of guarantee for borrowing the bill of lading and lend the original bill of lading (if the acceptance draft is accepted by a bank, the bill of lading can be taken all at once). Together with the signed import license, the original importer will then go to the shipping company to issue a split bill of lading and complete customs declaration and tax payment procedures. (In the bill of lading borrowing procedure, the Central Trust Bureau stipulates that two shop guarantors must return the bill of lading within three weeks). (2) The bill of lading will be split into three copies (two copies and one copy). One-quarter copy is for the original importer to take delivery of the goods. The other two copies are to be returned to the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping. At the same time, the previously issued "Letter of Guarantee for Borrowing the Bill of Lading" will be withdrawn. (3) When the two commercial acceptance drafts for 30 days and 45 days mature, the corresponding split bills of lading kept by the Central Trust Bureau will be taken out to take delivery of the goods, and the special foreign currency deposit certificate for the acquired goods will be collected. At this point, all application, acquisition, distribution, and purchase procedures are completed.

### Rice Prices in Production Areas Reported to Rise; Rice Market Transactions Halted; Social Affairs Bureau Sells 13,000 piculs

[Report from Our Newspaper] The rising trend in the rice market continues unabated. Yesterday, the total registered arrivals in the North and South markets were only 2,449 piculs. Because of the high price quotations from Wuxi production areas, many clients were unwilling to sell on the market and instead kept their rice on the grain boats in the Suzhou Creek, adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The market situation is chaotic, with numerous rumors, making people feel uneasy and causing transactions to halt. The off-market price reached 3 million, but there were no transactions. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to sell 13,000 piculs at a price of 2.25 million, distributing them to 2,100 rice shops, with a door price of 2.45 million. However, each person was limited to purchasing five liters, and many citizens lined up to buy. According to the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau: Currently, the rice prices in production areas such as Wuxi often exceed those in this city, which is an abnormal phenomenon. If the rice price in this city is too low, rice merchants, prioritizing profit, will cause a backflow, affecting the city's reserves, and the consequences will be more serious than the current situation. After careful review, the authorities believe that maintaining a balance between rice prices in various regions is the most important thing. Currently, in addition to suppressing prices in production areas, the city will also implement comprehensive grain rationing starting from March, which can also alleviate the rising trend to a considerable extent.

Yesterday, the price of white japonica rice broke through the 3 million mark, once shouted up to 3.1 million, but later there were a few transactions at 3.05 million. Thin paddy rice also reached the 3 million mark, and early rice was 2.95 million, each rising sharply by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Market transactions were limited to supplying rationed rice, with no other transactions.

Flour: Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, wheat opened high at 1.9 million. The soaring prices in Suzhou and Wuxi made buying even more active, and sellers were even less willing to sell, causing prices to rise again sharply. Lao Che brand flour opened at 1.45 million, then fell back to 1.44 million. Hong Feng and Jian Cheng brands both opened at 1.4 million, then soared all the way to 1.43 million. At the close, Hong Feng was at 1.4 million and Jian Cheng was at 1.39 million, each brand rising sharply by 120,000 to 130,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Large-bag bran was actively traded, opening at 850,000, rising all the way to 920,000, and closing at 900,000, a sharp increase of 100,000 yuan.

Cooking Oil: Seeing an unprecedented and large-scale price surge, the tension in the market has reached a point where sellers have disappeared. At a time when the second phase of household oil rationing has already begun, this price surge is completely unexpected. Yesterday, sellers held firm until the close, and there were no transactions. After the close, there were a few transactions. Factory soybean oil opened at 6.8 million, and rapeseed oil at 6.7 million, each rising sharply by 900,000 yuan. Raw oil surged by a huge 1 million yuan. Qingdao Ji brand raw oil traded at 7.5 million, with extremely few transactions. Soybean cake initially rose sharply by 10%, and at the close, it softened back, a sharp increase of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean commission houses and oil factories both entered the market, and the rising trend was fierce. Zha bean opened in the morning at 1.7 million yuan, already up 200,000 yuan from yesterday's market, and there were still many buyers, rising to 1.75 million yuan, a total increase of 250,000 yuan. Hankou car bean was at 1.9 million yuan, and Xianbu soybean was at 900,000 yuan, an increase of 200,000 to 250,000 yuan. The northern commission house had stocks of red sorghum. Zhabu red sorghum once reached a high of 1.92 million, an increase of more than 300,000 yuan. Later, due to a slowdown in sales, it fell back to 1.88 million yuan. Although the Tianjin commission house did not move its sesame seeds, because other grains were all rising, it dared not lag behind. Jiujiang milk sudan once rose to 3.2 million yuan, then fell back to 3.15 million yuan, with few transactions. Shelled peanuts were forcefully acquired by the Guangdong commission house, and tracked upwards. Qinhuangdao shelled peanuts opened at 4.3 million yuan, an increase of more than 300,000 yuan. Picked green beans also rose to 1.13 million yuan. Only corn was the odd one out, with high-grade goods flat and mediocre, and medium-grade goods selling relatively actively, with prices similar to yesterday's market.

### Rumors of Pound Sterling Devaluation; Hong Kong Dollar Market Price Plummets

[United Press Hong Kong, 26th] Since the war, the Hong Kong dollar has been consistently stable at US$0.2525. On the 25th, due to rumors of a pound sterling devaluation, the open market price fell to US$0.16. According to a British government spokesperson, this rumor, like past ones, is untrue and is a common tactic of speculators. At the same time, large sums of money being remitted to the United States have increased market unrest. The price of gold also surged to HK$372 per ounce, and closed at HK$365.

### Floating Capital Swarms In; Chinese Stocks' Rising Trend Difficult to Curb

Although Chinese stocks encountered external resistance as many as six times yesterday, rising and then falling, the assistance of materials and the impetus of the environment led to a wildfire-like effect near the close. Guohuo, with its new initiatives, and Jinglun, Jingfu, Meiya, and Qinxing all reached their daily limit again.

At the morning opening, Yongsheng Yarn fell to 1,020 yuan and 1,060 yuan, but small stocks continued to shine. Jinglun Net continued to hit its daily limit, and Guohuo also quickly caught up, opening much higher, attracting stock buyers, and suddenly the demand exceeded the supply, immediately hitting the limit. Yongsheng Yarn also gradually rose to a high price of 1,060 yuan and 1,095 yuan. The off-market interest rate still opened at 2.1 and 2.55 cents. Coupled with the tightening of off-market crackdowns, it gradually fell to a low price of 1,005 yuan and 1,040 yuan. Near noon, a buying spree was stirred up again. With Meiya being absorbed at numbers 207 and 224, it also rose a lot. Number 176 absorbed Rongfeng, and the buying spree was also extremely popular. Yongsheng Yarn closed at 1,060 yuan and 1,090 yuan. Compared with the previous day's closing price, Guohuo and Jinglun immediately hit the limit, Xinguang and Lian'an rose by 10%, Jingfu, Meiya, Qinxing, Xinhua, and Zhongsi rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly. For deferred delivery stocks, Huafeng fell slightly, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Meiya rose by 5%, Qinxing rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.

In the afternoon market, the price immediately rose to 1,075 yuan and 1,100 yuan, and was even pushed to 1,083 yuan and 1,110 yuan. Off-market telephone investigations became even tighter, and traffic brigades also entered the market. National Bank intervened, and the price fell to a low of 1,040 yuan and 1,070 yuan. When a counter-movement occurred, off-market matched trades were restricted again, and short sellers were panicked, while long buyers raised prices vigorously, and near the close, it rose to a new peak of 1,145 yuan and 1,152 yuan. Number 176 forcefully bought Meiya for immediate delivery, number 236 bought Meiya for deferred delivery, number 175 bought Qinxing for deferred delivery, and number 204 bought Jingfu for immediate delivery, also forcing them to rise to the limit. Lian'an and Xinhua also reached their limits near the close. As a result, compared with the morning's closing price for immediate delivery stocks, Guohuo, Jinglun, Jingfu, Meiya, Lian'an, and Xinhua all hit the limit, Neiyi was flat, Xinguang rose slightly, Zhabei, Zhongfa, Huochai, Shangwu, Tongyi, and Zhongfang each rose by about 10%, and the rest rose by 5%. For deferred delivery stocks, Qinxing and Meiya hit the limit, and the rest rose by 5%. Among off-market unlisted stocks, bank stocks were the most popular, rising by 10%. Utility stocks were mediocre, and the rest rose slightly by 5% or less.

Arbitrage Trading

Yesterday, the phenomenon of loose credit continued. The interest rate for bill discounting was only 1.3 to 1.8 cents, and after a high point, it gradually decreased. In terms of discount prices, Yongsheng Yarn initially opened at 42 yuan, a high price of 43 yuan, a low price of 34 yuan, and closed at 38 yuan. Meiya retreated from 75 yuan to 65 yuan, and Xinhe retreated from 18 yuan to 17 yuan at the close. Huafeng was 23 yuan, and Xinguang was 6.5 yuan.

Range of Increase and Decrease

### National Bonds Led the Rise; Foreign Stocks Were Briskly Profitable

Government bonds also led the rise yesterday, but it was difficult to sustain. Category C bonds opened in the morning at 90,000 yuan, reached a high price of 100,000 yuan, and then gradually fell back. Rooms 550 and 552 of Dachengxing bought in, while rooms 503, 360, and 500 sold out. The turnover was about 4 million. Compared with the previous close, categories A, B, and D were flat, category C rose by 1,000 yuan, and category E was up by 4,001 yuan.

Foreign stocks stabilized with Hong Kong Electric halfway through the day, and fell back after rising. However, the process still followed the Chinese stock route, and brisk profitability was reported again near the close. Guangdong commission houses and foreign firms had mixed buying and selling, and securities commission houses sold first and then bought in. Yisha opened in the morning at 1.17 million, fell back to 1.11 million, and then turned around. Finally, the market surged again, approaching a high price of 1.3 million at the close. Compared with the previous close, Yisha, British Union, and Aviation each rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly.

### Yarn and Cloth Soared All the Way; Fine Yarn and Fangjian Not Listed

Regarding the cotton yarn market yesterday, at the morning opening, due to the excessive increase the day before, all parties adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market tended to be stable. The Yuanfang and Jian company continued to be listed, with only grades below 21 counts, and 42 and 32 counts had no listed prices, so people's hearts were firm. 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn went straight up to 130 million yuan, and 40-count yarns each broke through the 100 million yuan mark.

Regarding the cotton cloth market yesterday, at the initial opening, the bidding was all weakened due to some retail investors still selling and the asking price was once suppressed. With the help of the customers and dyeing factories, the market broke out again. As a result, 12-pound leading five-blessing and other grades of fine cloth continued to rise from 70,000 to 156,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Spot Cotton Turned Stable Yesterday, the trading volume in the spot cotton market turned prosperous, and the industry absorbed as soon as they saw sales, and the market price rose. In the afternoon, the cotton yarn was slightly smaller, and the floating multiples took the opportunity to sell high, and the trend was 　stable. However, due to the depletion of sources, people were still hoarding, and prices did not see a small decline. The total daily turnover was 450 packages.

Fangjian Sold Yarn [Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, China Fangjian Company continued to sell yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee at the Yarn Industry Association, with a total of 16 types opened. About 2,400 pieces were allowed to purchase, totaling about 3,000 pieces of 20-count yarn.

### Silk Yarn and Woven Products Rose

China Textile first shouted for an increase, and the factories of Zhanghua, Xiexin, Yuanfeng, and Yinfeng each followed suit, raising the factory prices by 20%. The listing prices in door stores and zero-cut stores were therefore fiercely increased again. The standards for the tea party market and large wholesalers have once again entered a state of chaos.

### Rayon Initially Weak then Firm; Silk Goods Transactions Desolate

The rayon market was weak yesterday morning. No. 120 Asahi brand Yukiji was priced at 43 million yuan at the opening, and once rose to 49 million yuan for the spot price, and the price for the next day was lowered to 41 million yuan in the afternoon.

The silk goods market continued to be brisk yesterday, and the transactions of silk quilts and checkered crepe in the venue initially stopped due to disputes over the difference in gold. After the market was reopened at 9:30, Huaqiang quilts were made for 5.5 million yuan, and Dachong checkered Biyu was priced at 285,000 yuan.

### The yarn pipe will suppress the surge in cotton prices and formulate emergency measures

[Reported by this newspaper] The yarn pipe association believes that commodity prices have been rising day by day, and cotton prices have also increased accordingly. In the past, the material and transportation department of the association convened the parties concerned to make reasonable adjustments based on the actual situation in the market.

It is now reported that some unscrupulous cotton merchants are freely buying and selling cotton privately, raising prices and disrupting the market. If strict investigation and prohibition are not carried out, the cotton unified purchase policy will inevitably be affected. In order to suppress the surge in cotton prices, the association has formulated five "temporary emergency measures to suppress the surge in cotton prices" and strictly implemented them.

The measures are explored and recorded as follows: (1) The Yarn Control Committee and the Municipal Government will jointly announce that the free buying and selling of cotton is prohibited. Those who violate the rules will have their cotton confiscated and will be severely punished according to law. (2) The association will send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Garrison Command to strictly prohibit the black market trading of cotton. (3) The association will notify the warehouses again that all cotton stored by manufacturers must have the association's transfer notice before it can be released from the warehouse. If there is any unauthorized transfer, the warehouses will be fully responsible. (4) The association will investigate the amount of cotton stored by manufacturers in each warehouse. (5) The association will write to the Customs and ask them to notify the association of each day's transfers for future reference, and no extraction is allowed without the association's permission.

### Mourning My Teacher Professor Fahr

— Liang Junqing

Suddenly, a piece of bad news came, saying that the great German pathologist, Professor Fahr, had committed suicide and died. Immediately, a kind of indescribable sadness filled my heart, causing me to look westward and think for a long time.

I remembered when I was studying at the University of Hamburg in Germany, I always listened to his teachings in the pathological anatomy room for several hours every day. Now that I have returned to China for seventeen or eighteen years, I have never forgotten his short body, his gray William-style beard, his round and large half-bald head, and his kind and often smiling shadow. Indeed, anyone who has heard him give a lecture once will not forget his kind attitude and his eloquent and clear speech. But now he is dead. He committed suicide because he was unaccustomed to the tragic situation after Germany's defeat. Alas! This is truly a great loss to the world's medical community.

Our teacher, Professor Fahr (Prof. Dr. Th. Fahr), should be about seventy years old now. He has been working diligently and tirelessly throughout his life, burying himself in research, invention, and tirelessly enlightening future generations. He has made great contributions to research on muscular rheumatism. He has also made very successful discoveries in the field of cancer. In addition, he has also done many admired research works in the fields of heart and nerves. However, unlike other pathologists who specialize in self-aggrandizement and try to boast in various ways, fearing that people would not know about their own achievements, he was very humble and reserved. Although he can be said to be an authority in the field of pathology, he never boasted, he only knew how to dedicate his life's work to medicine and to train future generations. People like him who do not want fame or fortune, and only know how to strive for medicine, are rare not only in China, but also in Germany. So I feel infinitely sad about his death!

I often hear friends say: "Life is like a lifetime, grass grows for an autumn. A person lives in the world, either for fame or for profit. If you are neither for fame nor for profit, then aren't you a fool?" Indeed, these words have their truth. My teacher may have discovered that he was being a fool, neither for fame nor for profit, but only knowing how to seek welfare for the people throughout his life. As a result, after working hard all his life, he could only do some life-saving work to some extent, but in every corner of the world, countless people were making weapons to kill people, or were killing people in large numbers, so he was discouraged, and took a pistol to end his foolish life.

However, I always feel that there are too few fools like him in the world. If there could be many fools, maybe this world would be a little better. It is a pity that a fool like him is also dead.

Alas! He has ended his foolish life very comfortably. I wonder if the work we do here every week is welcomed by him?

### Defense Against Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Yu Zhengxing

B Fresh Air. Fresh air is essential for treating tuberculosis, so patients should spend more time outdoors. If the doctor permits, patients can sleep on the veranda. Even when living indoors, windows should be kept open day and night, except during bad weather (such as strong winds), as stale air contains carbon dioxide, moisture, dust, germs, and other impurities. Moreover, it lacks oxygen, making it unsuitable for patients. Therefore, one should live in a place with good air circulation and coolness. It is not advisable to reside in cities; instead, move to the countryside, to a place with a good environment for recuperation. The living room should be bright, spacious, clean, and tidy to avoid dust. Open the windows daily to allow air to circulate, facilitating easy breathing, as tuberculosis bacteria do not easily survive in circulating air.

C Climate. Climate significantly affects tuberculosis. It is advisable to choose a high mountain or coastal climate, as it can stimulate appetite and increase oxygen supply, promoting metabolism and shifting the disease mechanism towards improvement. However, patients with hemoptysis (coughing up blood) should avoid high altitudes. High mountains and coastal areas often experience strong winds and sudden weather changes, so it is best to choose a suitable location that avoids these drawbacks.

(II) Nutritional Diet. Tuberculosis patients experience significant bodily consumption, requiring more replenishment. Patients often have taste disorders and reduced appetite, so they should be provided with highly nutritious and easily digestible foods to compensate for their losses. Weight gain is a sign of recovery from this disease. To achieve this, one should stimulate a strong appetite and choose highly nutritious foods. All essential nutrients should be adequately present, avoiding both deficiency and excess, to ensure a balanced supply for the body's nutritional needs. However, avoid overeating to prevent gastrointestinal issues. Eggs, chicken, and fresh vegetables are excellent foods. Meat and milk are secondary choices, but considering that Chinese people generally lack a habit of consuming milk, this should be taken into account. Additionally, include appropriate carbohydrates and a large amount of vitamin C for regulation. A small amount of alcohol can stimulate appetite and is permissible. Cod liver oil is rich in vitamins A and D, nourishing the body and increasing resistance, so it can be used liberally. However, pay attention to appetite when taking it; discontinue if there are any disturbances. Regarding the quantity of various foods, aim for moderation and avoid forcing oneself.

(III) Rest and Recuperation. The main treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis patients is rest. Therefore, patients should be kept absolutely quiet, resting in bed, and minimizing activity. Generally, pulmonary tuberculosis patients often experience excessive consumption, poor appetite, and insufficient nutrition. Excessive exercise further increases consumption, so sufficient rest is essential to maintain physiological functions. However, consider the sunlight exposure and duration when lying down. The purpose of bed rest for tuberculosis patients is similar to resting to allow wound regeneration. The lungs breathe fifty times per minute when running, twenty-five times when walking, and ten times when resting. Thus, resting can reduce lung movement to ten times per minute, increasing lung rest, regeneration ability, and opportunity. Rest is not just about not working; recuperation involves lying in bed, resting peacefully. Physical rest is not enough; mental rest is also necessary. Worry, anxiety, and excessive concern can cause mental unease. Mental unease prevents the full benefits of rest. Constant fretting about one's illness is a sign of weak willpower. One must maintain a cheerful mind, and the illness will easily heal; as the saying goes, "a broad mind leads to a robust body."

Preventive Measures

(I) Establishing Tuberculosis Consultation Centers. Local health authorities should establish specialized tuberculosis consultation centers as the core of tuberculosis prevention. Their responsibilities include health education on tuberculosis, guidance and supervision of healthy individuals, and prevention or improvement of patients' living environment, nutrition, and occupation, as well as guidance on recuperation and caregiving methods. Patients may also be sent to appropriate sanatoriums for isolation.

(II) Universally Establishing Tuberculosis Clinics. Local governments have a duty to prevent tuberculosis and should establish tuberculosis clinics universally. Their primary tasks include early diagnosis, detection of new cases, examination of contacts, and monitoring patients undergoing home treatment. Night clinics should also be opened to facilitate medical visits for working patients. Other measures such as home visits, nursing, disinfection, testing, education, and isolation of tuberculosis patients should be vigorously promoted.

(III) Sanatoriums. Sanatoriums can be divided into two types: recuperative sanatoriums and treatment sanatoriums. Acute, critical, and difficult cases are generally sent to treatment sanatoriums. Patients with better prognoses who require long-term recuperation are sent to recuperative sanatoriums. In addition, the establishment of "tuberculosis villages" to accommodate discharged patients and provide employment guidance, as well as solutions to nutrition and housing problems, is also very important.

(IV) Mandating Practitioner Participation in Prevention Efforts. Physicians have a duty to educate pulmonary tuberculosis patients on preventive measures and to report to health authorities. Practitioners must cooperate with health authorities, working together to combat tuberculosis and becoming part of the prevention effort.

(V) Defining Sanitary Administrative Authority. Sanitary administrative authorities have the power to issue orders and punishments when they believe there is a risk of spreading pulmonary tuberculosis. They also have the authority to order improvements to facilities in factories and schools. Tuberculosis patients and their families have a duty to comply with the tasks carried out by sanitary authorities.

Preventive Vaccination: To prevent pulmonary tuberculosis, BCG vaccine can be used to generate special immunity in the body, resisting tuberculosis bacteria. The BCG vaccine was invented in 1921, originally named Bacilles de Calmette et Guerin, after its inventors, the French scientists Calmette and Guerin. BCG is a type of tuberculosis bacteria from cattle. After rigorous processing, it can be injected into the human body without harm, while generating resistance to tuberculosis bacteria. The BCG vaccine can enhance the resistance to tuberculosis bacteria in infants and reduce the infant tuberculosis mortality rate. Newborns in families with tuberculosis should still be isolated, but the vaccine has great value in preventing infection and can be widely promoted. Several European countries have used it for a long time, with Denmark having the best results. Currently, European and American countries widely adopt it, with Soviet health authorities promoting it vigorously. The U.S. Department of Health designated the University of Illinois in July of this year with $360,000 to prepare for the manufacture and supply of BCG vaccine nationwide to universally promote it across the country and defend against tuberculosis invasion. Our country's health authorities also have such preparations. If it can be universally inoculated in those who have not been infected, the results of tuberculosis prevention will be significant.

Conclusion

The tubercle bacillus is a common enemy of humanity. Almost no one in the world can escape its influence. Those who do seem to be exceptions. In children under ten, skin tests using tuberculin already show a positive result in 97%. Modern pathologists have discovered initial complex lesion clusters, further proving that everyone suffers from tuberculosis upon autopsy. No matter what cause of death is used as a standard, the mortality rate is never higher than that of tuberculosis. That is, the number of human deaths from tuberculosis is more than any other cause of death, more than wars, disasters, and more than other legally mandated acute infectious diseases. We have already understood that the most terrible aspects of tuberculosis transmission are: (1) It often invades strong adults, depriving the nation of the most vigorous labor force, indirectly affecting productivity. (2) It is more prevalent in cities than in the countryside, and more prevalent in schools and factories than in ordinary places. This severely devastates the core areas of national production, education, and political progress. (3) Pulmonary tuberculosis leads to a tuberculous constitution, increasing the incidence of disease, increasing mortality, and sharply reducing the population. Long-term chronic diseases, in terms of population quality, are precursors to racial degeneration and symbols of declining national quality.

During wartime, pulmonary tuberculosis is widespread in our country, harming national health. The entire nation suffers significant losses spiritually, physically, and materially. Short life spans and premature deaths constitute a major national crisis. We should, in line with the needs of national reconstruction, improve the national quality, strengthen the nation, and actively implement tuberculosis prevention. Unified planning and universal implementation are needed. On the surface, the aim is to relieve the suffering of patients, but in reality, it should reduce the number of patients, eliminate transmission, and promote a strong and prosperous nation. Therefore, strict implementation of tuberculosis prevention is essential to ensure national health and strength, which would be the greatest fortune for the nation.

In conclusion, tuberculosis prevention is an important task for national self-strengthening today. Tuberculosis prevention is self-defense, a means to survive. "If you don't kill tuberculosis, tuberculosis will kill you." Therefore, from a humanitarian standpoint, starting with our own survival, we must seek improvement, implement social healthcare, and eliminate the terrible pulmonary tuberculosis. The current economic inequality is already a social injustice and misfortune. Further economic inequality that prevents people from enjoying health security is even more unfair. At the same time, from an international perspective, to cope with changes and enhance our international position, the government should implement a public health system to ensure the health and safety of the people. Therefore, we hope that the government will plan and take steps to prevent tuberculosis. Social figures should also be motivated by a sense of duty, working together to eliminate the threat to our lives and the obstacles to our safety—pulmonary tuberculosis. (To be continued)

### On Medicine and Pharmaceuticals in the Countryside (Part 1)

— Xu Jin

It is an undeniable fact that doctors and pharmacies are mostly concentrated in cities. Let alone residents in poor and remote areas not enjoying the blessings of modern medicine and pharmaceuticals, even counties and towns far from the coast or not accessible by railways are still being fooled by general sorcerers and traveling charlatans. It is said that when compatriots in the Northwest Frontier get sick, they ask a sorcerer to chant a spell, a method called "judgment by heaven." What is "judgment by heaven"? It is to carry the patient under the sun and expose them for three days. If the patient has not sinned in their lifetime, according to the sorcerer, their illness is curable and they can recover without medicine. If the illness does not improve after three days of exposure, then they have sinned too much and are doomed, and they can only die on their own. Another story says that if a patient in a certain place has a high fever, they must ask a sorcerer to treat them. Before the sorcerer arrives, the patient's clothes are removed, and they hold a whip in their hand, chanting while chasing the patient and whipping them. The patient is flustered and anxious, running until they are out of breath and suddenly collapse. The sorcerer then puts away the whip and instructs that the patient be picked up, their sweat wiped dry with a towel, and then covered well with a quilt. They lie down for a night, and it is said that the fever will subside the next day. While the sorcerer is desperately whipping the patient, the patient's family only eavesdrops outside the house until the patient collapses and the sorcerer shouts loudly, then the family dares to come in and thank the sorcerer repeatedly. This seems like a funny play to us outsiders, but how much silent ignorance and tears are contained in this funny play!

From a scientific standpoint, this treatment method is not entirely absurd. Exposure to sunlight does have some effect on certain diseases. Chasing and whipping the patient has the effect of forcing the patient to sweat and dispersing local congestion (Decongestion). These are all physical therapies (Phystotheiagie), but using a fixed method to treat ever-changing diseases is certainly not enough. Furthermore, using this method indiscriminately without considering the severity of the illness is also unreasonable. To allow sorcerers to perform the duties of doctors is a disgrace to the medical community!

Last autumn, the author was specially invited by a certain military commander to stay for two months in Jiawang Town, north of Xuzhou City. What I saw and heard sparked many feelings and truly experienced why urban doctors are unwilling to go to the countryside. Jiawang Town is only seventy miles from Xuzhou City and is accessible by the small railway of the East China Coal Mining Company, so it is not considered a remote area. However, it has already made doctors feel very inconvenient. There are no decent pharmacies there, and doctors are often worried about where to fill prescriptions. Fortunately, there is a mining area hospital there, and military officers can get medicine from the hospital, but they only have over-the-counter drugs and no one to compound prescriptions. Therefore, even a very ordinary prescription has to be taken by train to Xuzhou to be filled. Sometimes, Xuzhou cannot fill it either, so it has to be abandoned. Therefore, to practice medicine there, one must bring their own supplies, or know the types of medicines on the market, and only select from those medicines when prescribing. To have medicine but no drugs is still useless.

The mining area hospital is privately owned by the coal mining company and is specially set up to provide medical care for miners and their families. During the period of occupation, it was managed by the Japanese and was said to be quite well-equipped, with a large stock of Japanese drugs. After the victory, it was taken over by Chinese people, but many instruments were incomplete. Several rooms in the hospital were occupied by the military, leaving only three rooms for the hospital to use. The hospital was no longer a hospital, but the outpatient clinic was extremely busy. Each department had more than 300 patients per day, but there was only one doctor to see them. The doctor did not even have time to listen with a stethoscope, simply asking about the condition and signing the prescription. According to the doctor himself, his daily work was just about how to get the patients to leave because he was really too busy. However, according to the newly arrived Director Wang (sent by the Ministry of Health to take over), the two doctors were retained, and their qualifications may be questionable. Everything is currently being reorganized. The Ministry of Health has negotiated with the mining company authorities for the company to fund the construction of buildings and add wards. The Ministry will send a large number of drugs and equipment from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and the two parties will cooperate. At that time, physicians and nurses from various departments will be hired, and then everything can be put on track. He also wants to cooperate with medical schools, so that medical students can regularly go there for internships and jointly study the local prevalent infectious diseases. If this plan is implemented, it will indeed be very good, but until the author left, the buildings had not yet been fully completed.

If the authorities of the Ministry of Health can have concrete plans to distribute a large number of doctors and medicines to various places, we would be happy to see it happen. The Physicians' Association should also assist in the completion of this plan.

### Everyone, Please Get Vaccinated Quickly!

— Zhang Baoshu

Pray for blessings in the New Year; only disease prevention matters. To prevent smallpox, only vaccination works.

As the new year begins, everyone prays for blessings. Blessings do not come from heaven; they must be sought by ourselves. We are the gods, and the gods are us.

As the earth returns to spring, all things are born. Bacteria are also living things, so how can they not be born? Once born, they are active around us. If we do not seek hygiene, they can invade the human body anytime, anywhere, causing disease and threatening life. Mild cases drain strength and money, while severe cases result in the loss of both people and wealth.

The enemies of spring are familiar to everyone: smallpox, meningitis (commonly known as acute infantile convulsion), diphtheria, scarlet fever, and measles (commonly known as "zhenzi," not very dangerous). These six enemies are most difficult for young lives to withstand, but the old and young cannot escape them. There are countless other enemies joining in the excitement, but humans are in the middle, surrounded on all sides. Why not arm ourselves with hygienic methods to protect our lives?

The biggest enemy at present is "smallpox." The best and most appropriate weapon is "vaccination." It is hoped that everyone will use the same faith as in praying for blessings and get vaccinated quickly without delay!

The process of epidemic prevention tells us: "The following people must be vaccinated," otherwise their lives will be unsafe.

1. Newborn babies—do not wait for the umbilical cord to fall off—vaccinate immediately. If it does not take in five days, vaccinate again, and keep vaccinating until it takes.

2. Babies who have been vaccinated! Revaccinate every spring or winter, preferably when smallpox begins to appear, without waiting for warm weather. If it does not take in five days, vaccinate again, and keep vaccinating until it takes.

3. Male and female compatriots who have been vaccinated should revaccinate whenever smallpox begins to appear. Please do not forget to check after four days to see if it has taken. If it has not taken, revaccinate until it takes to be safe.

4. People who were vaccinated with "transferred seed vaccine" as children! Those whose vaccination did not take adequately or who have not been revaccinated for a long time should revaccinate for safety.

5. People who were vaccinated with "nasal vaccine" as children! Those whose vaccination did not take adequately or who have not been revaccinated for a long time should also revaccinate until it takes to be safe.

To eradicate smallpox, in addition to vaccinating, it is also important to isolate. That is, people with smallpox should be sent to the infectious disease hospital immediately and treated in the hospital until the scabs fall off completely before being released. This method is the most appropriate!

It is hoped that everyone will cooperate with all of the above and that everyone will do it. Then happiness will be endless, and there will be no need to pray for it!

Editor's Note: The author, Dr. Zhang Baoshu, is the director of the Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital. Because smallpox has been rampant recently, he has taken the time out of his busy schedule to write this article, hoping that all citizens of Shanghai will get vaccinated quickly to avoid contracting smallpox. This is also a "foolish" style of work, but it is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will not fail the fool's good intentions!

### Ode to School Shops

— Wang Qi

Although Oxford and Cambridge in England have some private characteristics, the Chinese have always looked down on private schools. Children studying at national or public schools seem to be a level above private school students. Private schools are like garbage trucks for public schools. Those who cannot enter public schools or are expelled from public schools use private schools as a final refuge. In Beijing, a certain middle school was being founded and specifically stated that anyone who had applied to a certain famous national university's affiliated middle school could be exempted from the entrance examination, regardless of whether they were admitted to the affiliated middle school or not. That is to say, anyone who had the guts to apply to the affiliated middle school must have a big background, and the private middle school considered itself a dedicated garbage truck for the affiliated middle school. As a result, its students were indeed many and especially many, and its curriculum also followed the affiliated middle school step by step, although its level was not necessarily very high.

The reason why Chinese people despise private schools is nothing more than because they want money, especially because they want money and have no results. A certain private middle school used a certain affiliated middle school as a banner, which was an advertisement striving for advancement, telling parents that although I charged a lot of money, the goods are not completely rotten, which is not unreasonable. Some schools have a sign "Test at any time" at the gate all year round, and the visitors are very few, which is a great eyesore. According to my ideal, in the Chinese environment, only private schools should be well-run, and public schools should not be involved. Why? First, this kind of school is not affected by personnel matters. The principal does not need to curry favor with the powerful, talk about internal and external lines, nepotism, or worry about the short-term nature of the position. Even if you run a school shop (according to the current situation, the disadvantages of running a shop cannot be completely eliminated for a while!), as long as the boss's situation improves slightly, they can take out a little conscience, seek some benefits for others, and sell some real goods, unlike public schools (which are actually also shops. Today, the status of teachers and students has become nonsense. Students feel that they are wealthy young ladies and young masters who have spent money to go to school, and teachers are poor and sour. If they violate the rules or fail, they can go elsewhere)! The principal's office is like going to a yamen, or like colleagues in a shop, seeing profit and loss as unrelated. Since it is their own business, they should at least hope for its success, not watch it wither. So, to put it bluntly, I am not against school shops. Selling goods is called "shop." Spending money and not getting goods is called "scam." Today's shops are "scams," not real "shops." Second, since it is their own shop, its construction and development can be based on their own ideals and freedom, without interference from this or that. The Chinese "upper echelons" are really fatal. A budget, a plan, turning it east and west, takes at least three months. Even if it is approved, it will not become money. Buying something costs at least one or two times the price, and the plan will be blown away. Their own shop, they have money, they can improve and build at any time. Taking libraries and laboratories as an example, they are the most important conditions for any school, but whether public schools can immediately raise tens of millions to buy books and medicines is definitely a problem. Also, the expansion and reorganization of classes are not so convenient in public schools. The standards for hiring and salaries are completely free. If you really want to recruit talents, why can't you invite university professors and education experts at a high price? This is something that cannot be done in public schools. Third, if the school shop is well-run, it will have both fame and fortune. Although they cannot get any medals, they can always get a plaque for being enthusiastic about education and "cultivating talents." Look at Mr. Zhang Boling today and Mr. Ye Chengzhong back then. Can't they be examples for today's school shop owners? Fourth, if we still have ideals and ambitions, private schools are the most suitable experimental grounds. Why? Because there are no restrictions mentioned above. In the past, the Shanggong Elementary School affiliated to the Commercial Press and the Wanzhu Elementary School affiliated to the China Association were both tested for many new teaching methods. How can public schools get that kind of strong assistance and strength? Based on the above, what harm do private school shops do to society? However, the current method is either to pull up seedlings to help them grow or to cut them down carelessly, treating students as objects to be scammed and teachers as factory workers (workers are treated much better than teachers, but their labor-capital relationship is similar), desperately squeezing their labor without regard to their lives. I once met a principal who wanted to run the school rationally, especially paying attention to the livelihood of teachers. He wanted to buy rice or gold notes with all the teachers' salaries to avoid losses. I said very good, but yesterday I saw in the newspaper that Guangzhou was in chaos because the principal of a private school invested tens of billions of tuition fees in gold notes, causing the market to be in chaos and the price of gold notes to skyrocket. The police will investigate and punish him. Then, needless to say, the principals only want to win alone, without considering others, and facilities for sharing benefits are fundamentally impossible. Even if there are enlightened people, it will cause financial fluctuations. I can't take such a big responsibility! All in all, this is the cancer of the whole society. What can be done to solve it? If the government thinks that private schools are unreasonable, they should fundamentally abolish them. Only limiting fees and not allowing them to exceed the limit, 4 million and 4.5 million, is the same as fifty steps and a hundred steps. It really doesn't make much of a difference. Rather than that, why not further supervise their use and distribution?

### The Alps Are Moving

— Yang Bao

The geologists of the Swiss Federal Research Institute have suddenly announced to Europe their discovery that has shocked the academic world: the Alps are moving!

This mountain range, known as the backbone of Europe, is incessantly moving northward, at a rate of twelve inches every century. The Rocheuses peak, which reaches 9,721 feet, is, according to research, constantly "marching towards Munich," but this need not alarm the residents of Bavaria, as they calculate that it will take two million years for this magnificent peak to "walk" to the streets of Munich.

Another major discovery is that the Rhine River swallows about 100 million cubic inches of mountain soil from the foot of the Alps every year, carrying it into Lake Constance. At this rate, in 16,000 years, this beautiful lake will be filled with this mountain soil.

### On Automobiles

— Ze Shi

I live in a small house along the street, specifically on West Beijing Road, one of Shanghai's main streets. The cars come and go like weaving, and the sound of horns never stops, only ceasing deep into the night. I hear it for about sixteen hours a day, which is truly unbearable. This makes me wonder why there are so many cars. Wouldn't it be much better for me if Shanghai had no cars, so my ears could be at peace? Wouldn't it be enriching the country and benefiting the people if the whole country had no cars?

Everyone knows that the country with the most cars in the world is the United States, but probably no one knows which country has the fewest. According to Americans, the country with the most cars seems to be the most civilized. This is just a case of "selling melons and saying they are sweet," as the United States is the most developed country in the automobile industry. Even if cars truly represent civilization, there is nothing we can do if we are not civilized for a while. Ordering cars from the United States is very welcome, but borrowing money from them is very difficult, and they refuse to accept legal tender or customs gold for car payments. There is also the issue of gasoline. Therefore, if China never uses a single car, the national treasury will definitely be more abundant. This is the reason why not using cars is enough to enrich the country.

Secondly, let's talk about benefiting the people. Today's women who ride in cars are the same as the sedan chair class of the past. A car only needs one driver, but carrying a sedan chair requires at least two people. Replacing sedan chairs with cars is a way to solve some of the unemployment problem. The wages saved from sedan chair carriers can be used to pay for the gasoline, which will certainly be more than enough.

To narrow the scope, today there is much talk of layoffs in various organizations, which scares civil servants. I think, why not replace people with cars, i.e., cut cars instead of people? The number of superfluous staff in an organization is probably not more than the number of cars used by the various leaders, right? Moreover, the cost of one car on the books is certainly more than the salary of one employee.

You might say that cars travel like flying, saving time and greatly helping those who ride in them to be more efficient. This sounds right, but it is not. I remember when a certain new indexing method was first invented, its advertisement said: "Using this indexing method, you can save five minutes a day, one hundred and fifty minutes a month, and one thousand eight hundred minutes a year. If we live a little less, say sixty years, we will save a total of one hundred and eight thousand minutes. Sixty minutes is one hour, twenty-four hours is one day, which means we save one thousand eight hundred hours, or seventy-five days, more than two months. Isn't it precious to gain more than two months of life by using this new indexing method?" At the time, I was silent. I think the average person probably doesn't look up words in the dictionary for five minutes a day, so where would they save this amount? Even if they could save it, they would waste more than five minutes in other places. Riding in a car can save more than just five minutes a day, but the question is what do you do with the time saved? For example, it takes an hour to walk from Tian Street to Yi Street, but only five minutes by car. Using a car to travel saves forty-five minutes, but there are many ways to use these forty-five minutes: if I like to sleep, I can use it to sleep more; if you like to play cards, you can use it to play four more rounds... Of course, if you like to work, you can use it to do a little more work. However, first, people who like to work are probably very rare; second, even if you like to work, you are not allowed to do more, because there is a fixed time for work. For example, if you start at nine in the morning, the forty-five minutes saved by riding in a car cannot be used for work, i.e., the person riding in the car will not arrive at eight fifteen. Moreover, in fact, people who drive to work arrive later than those who walk.

As I was writing this, a lady came to visit my wife. She talked about how her cousin's husband had recently been promoted and made a fortune, so he took a concubine and was "spoiling the concubine and neglecting the wife." After saying this, she sighed and said, "Once a husband starts riding in a car, the future of the wife becomes precarious." I couldn't help but smile, so I added this note.

### Unforgettable

— Ke Luo

In a small town in America, there was a very kind doctor. A farmer lived in the town, and he often asked the doctor to treat his illnesses. The farmer's family was poor, both husband and wife were weak, and they had many children. Almost everyone was often sick, and the poor father could only sigh at the ceiling, unable to afford the medical expenses.

However, whenever they asked the doctor to treat them, the doctor always responded and often stayed up all night to take care of the patients. The farmer, besides paying a small amount of consultation fees as a token of appreciation, often sent some eggs and other agricultural products to the doctor.

Now, this doctor has been dead for many years, and the farmer's later years are very good. His children have all grown up, and his life has gradually become better. The poverty and illness of the past seem like just a nightmare.

However, the farmer's family can still be seen at the doctor's daughter's home. They often send a little bit of eggs, vegetables, and the like to her - even now. Although the doctor has been sleeping for a long time, the family who benefited from his kindness will never forget him.

Chapter 11 Full of Doubts (81)

Zhu Zhai said: "The boss wants to rest, I'll go back too!" Mother Xiao Wang said disappointedly, "Why are you leaving so soon? Did you find out what that Miao Mu is?" Zhu Zhai shook his head and said, "I can't figure it out, he didn't tell me in detail, I'll talk about it later." After speaking, he hurried down the stairs and went straight out the door. Walking on the road, he felt very lost in his heart, not knowing where to go. He paced along the road, only thinking, Qi Wan's words today were too ambiguous. She is usually very frank with people, especially with me, she talks about everything and discusses everything. Today, when she speaks to me, she is suddenly cold and hot, and her attitude is very different from usual. She didn't come back all night last night, and she wouldn't say where she went. Most likely, she was with that person named Miao. Zhu Zhai thought of this, and jealousy suddenly arose. He stomped his foot, feeling that he had worried about her and ran around for her last night in vain. He stood foolishly by the road for a while before he came back to his senses and went straight to the dormitory along the road, feeling extremely depressed. He lay on the bed and thought for a while, but still couldn't figure out why Qi Wan had this change. His mind was confused, as if he wanted to pull out a clue from the tangled mess and study it, but the more he thought, the more confused he became. He sat up and saw a bottle of brandy on the small table in front of the bed. This was originally given to him by Qi Wan, preparing him to drink a sip when the weather was bad in the morning, so as not to catch a cold. Zhu Zhai stared blankly at the bottle of wine for a while, feeling that Qi Wan usually took care of him in every possible way, so why did she have this change today? What is the reason for the change? He speculated in various ways, but couldn't figure it out. So he took a wine glass and poured a glass of brandy on the tea table, drank it all in one gulp, and then lay back on the bed, wanting to calm his mind and sleep for a while to relax his brain. However, his thoughts lingered in his mind, constantly circulating, and the more he wanted to sleep, the less he could fall asleep. So he sat up again and drank a full glass of brandy. After drinking this glass of brandy, his brain nerves were actually numb. His eyelids twitched, and he felt dizzy. After a while, he fell into the land of sleep. Zhu Bao relied on these two glasses of wine to get a good night's sleep. The next day, when he woke up, his brain moved and his thoughts came to his mind again. He felt that with Qi Wan's usual behavior, she wouldn't have this change. Now he doesn't need to investigate her, just advise her not to get close to that person named Miao, so as not to be tempted by him; he must also examine himself to see if there is anything wrong that Qi Wan sees. If he really has a fault, then he must correct it to avoid misunderstandings.

### About Mr. Chu Nanqiang

— Shi Shufan

This magazine recently discussed the affairs of Chu Jiansou of Yixing, lamenting his lack of recognition after the war and expressing nostalgia. I, Bunning, have a slight connection with Mr. Nanqiang, and I still often communicate with him. Therefore, I will describe his recent situation and his general situation of avoiding the Japanese invaders in the past, so as to inform those who are concerned about Mr. Chu. Jiansou is his pen name.

From the beginning of the war to the end of the war, Mr. Chu always lived in Shanjuan Cave in Zhangzhu, Yixing. Although he once sought refuge in Guangde, it was only for a short time. In the winter of the thirtieth year, I was living in seclusion in West Tianmu Mountain, drafting proclamations in Mr. Yang Ling's office. The place controlled three borders and was connected to Yi and Guang. The messengers came and went in an endless stream, and I often heard about Mr. Jian Sou's daily life. Mr. Zhao Fuyi of the Party and Government Council of the Third War Zone, who transmitted words of greetings to me, was within sight, only a meeting was lacking. Tianmu is four or five days away from Yi, and the path is rugged. It is tiring to ride up the slopes, and my body cannot bear the fatigue. Therefore, after two rounds of hot and cold seasons, I have not visited once. I once replied in a letter: "The misty waves of Lake Li, vast and impossible to connect." Thinking about it, I can't help but feel disappointed! Mr. Chu was living in the wilderness, but he was highly respected in the southeast. At that time, when the generals and officials passed by, they would get out of their cars to visit him, seeking his advice. Those who did not know often saw bows and knives in the alley, and suspected that he was leading his three thousand sons to kill the invaders. The rumors spread, and this led to the legend of fighting guerrillas. Later, I turned to eastern Zhejiang, and communication was interrupted for more than a year. The year before last, I traveled to Shanghai and resumed communication with this old man, picking up the threads of the past. Knowing that he was still difficult to set foot in Yangxian city, with plum blossoms marking the passage of time in the cave. Last autumn, Mr. Chu planned to compile the stories of Shanjuan and Gengsang caves and print them for the world to see. However, the price of paper rose day by day, so the plan was delayed. At the end of the year, he wrote that the Shanjuan Temple at the entrance of the cave had been repaired twice, but both times it was destroyed. Now he did not dare to build and decorate it again. After the war, the rivers and mountains were not more peaceful, and I longed for my hometown, feeling the same way! Mr. Chu devoted his life's energy to the two caves, exploring their mysteries and secrets, working hard without complaint. His purpose was to make the wonders of the world public, so even though there may be things to discuss about the axe and chisel, they cannot be criticized for this reason alone. I remember that between the years of the Republic of China twenty-one and twenty-two, my friend Yao Yuangan introduced Mr. Chu to Jiang Shunan, the old man of Geng Yandang. They sat together in one room, removing their clothes at the top of the peaks. At that time, Jiang was intent on building Yandang Mountain, and Mr. Chu was also madly pouring gold into the two caves. They admired each other from afar, and each led the mountains and rivers. Once they met, the spray wet the lamp, because the two old men were both talkative and had similar interests. They traveled dozens of miles a day, followed by sleepless nights, without feeling tired. But after a while, Shunan compared himself to the Stone Gate Pool, holding sand and throwing himself into the Xiang River, and the matter was difficult to investigate. Only Mr. Chu breathed clearly and remained old and leisurely in the lake waves and shadows. However, he is now also over seventy years old. Mr. Chu enjoyed fame very early. When he was in his prime, he was as important as Zhang Jian of Nantong and Jiang Zhuzhuang of Wujin, each ruling a state. Or he was jokingly called the local emperor, which was to respect him. Tracing his life, his merits outweighed his crimes, and there was a definite conclusion. At the beginning of the year, I received a letter from Mr. Chu, inviting me to visit Bixian Nunnery during the apricot blossom season, as the Yichuan section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Road was about to be completed, and the bridges from Chuanbu to Zhangzhu were also being laid. For ten years, I was blocked by the war, and it was difficult to reach Taoyuan. Unexpectedly, after waking up from a spring dream, I could still see this old man welcoming me at the entrance of the cave with a wine jug? At the end of the letter, he attached a photo of the Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi'an, thinking to dispel his old feelings, mostly relying on notes and descriptions. I regretted that I could not find a picture of a piece of sky to offer. Mr. Chu has a daughter named Nengzi, who is proficient in poetry and literature, and skilled in swordsmanship. In the past, my friend Yi Junzuo wrote a song of bright pearls and precious swords to praise her. Passing on the scriptures and subduing women, I guess she is also middle-aged, but I have not asked who she married. She is a companion to this beautiful concubine, truly a blessing!

### Qingcheng in the Northwest: Xinglong Mountain (Part 1)

— Junzuo

Spring water clear without bottom, high buildings overlook the two mountains. Woodcutters happy to chop wood, boiling tea to the children's joy. Trees green floating screw dai, sky blue writing colored rings. How many fame and fortune guests, why like white clouds?

——Yi Junzuo: Visiting Xinglong Mountain——

Qingcheng Mountain, one of China's famous mountains, is located in Guan County, Sichuan Province. During the War of Resistance, I served in Chengdu for a period of time. Due to enemy bombing, my family was evacuated and moved to Shangqing Palace, the highest peak of this Qingcheng Mountain, as neighbors with Zhang Daqian. At that time, I wrote a poem about moving to Shangqing Palace and the beautiful scenery of Qingcheng Mountain:

I bid farewell to Jinli and dreamed of hibiscus, and stayed overnight at the first peak of Qingcheng. The wind carries smoke traces and blows into fog, and the mountains connect with human shadows and turn into rainbows. The sound of rain in the middle of the night thunders, and the color of the sun is bright and agate is thick. Several plum blossoms are red like fire, and a basket of tea leaves is as green as scallions.

Qingcheng Mountain was praised by Lu Fangweng as a famous mountain like a green wave (the mountains are like green rolling eastward), the forests are lush, and the sun is covered. Wu Zhilao called it the most secluded place in the world. Thirty-six peaks, each peak is beautiful, verdant and dripping. This mountain in Sichuan rivals Mount Emei.

After I came to Guanzhou, I was very disappointed to see that the mountains in the northwest were mostly loess bare mountains. The mountains around Lanzhou, such as Bi Li and White Pagoda, are famous, but they are barren. Later, someone said: Only Xinglong Mountain is very different, the whole mountain is full of ancient trees and shade. After visiting, it really lived up to its name, it is simply a miracle in the northwest. Because this mountain, its secluded beauty, and lush forests are very similar to Qingcheng. Up until recently, I have visited three times, and each time I doubted that I had entered the dreamland of Qingcheng.

Xinglong Mountain is ninety miles away from Lanzhou City and belongs to Yuzhong County. There is a highway that leads directly to the foot of the mountain. After passing Yuzhong County, a small long street runs along the stream, with green willows on both sides, and the scenery gradually becomes different. Facing two high peaks opposite each other: the western one is named Qiyun Mountain, and the fruit-like one is named Xinglong Mountain (commonly known as Xinglong Mountain, because during the Shunqing era, people were afraid of disrespecting the emperor's dignity, so they changed the dragon character to the vulgar Long character, which means business is booming. The height difference is limited; between the two mountains is a clear stream, naturally forming a gap. The two mountains are closely connected by a rope bridge, named Yunlong Bridge, meaning "wind follows dragon".

At the foot of Qiyun Mountain, there is a villa where Chairman Jiang once lived, which is clean and gorgeous. It is now managed by the Lanzhou Lizhi Society as a reception center to provide food and lodging for tourists. Behind the villa is Chaoyuan Temple, with three halls in the main hall, enshrining the statue of Lu Zu, wearing red boots and yellow robes, holding a Mao Emperor, sitting humorously in the temple thinking. There are six tablet rooms on the right of the hall, which record the history of this mountain. Above Chaoyuan Temple, you can enter the forest. The entire east and west mountains are wrapped in lush forests, green and lush. Qiyun Mountain is tall and outstanding, detached from the crowd, with winding steps and temples standing in rows. Although the mountain path is not wide, it is very clean. From time to time, Taoists cut off dead branches and widen the road surface; the slope is not very large, and it does not take much effort to climb the mountain. Ancient trees are shady, cool as autumn. Going west from Chaoyuan Temple, the county cliffs are steep, and the Xixin Pavilion is built on it, with Wu Yuanzi's hand-recorded Lu Zu Bai Zi Tablet and his own Qiyun Song. Behind the pavilion is a magnificent and empty Fuyuan Building. Going north, there is Wu Yuanzi Temple, which enshrines the god statue of Wu Yuanzi, who is thin and emaciated and looks withered. In front of the temple is a stone tablet with vigorous calligraphy and exquisite flatness and neatness, which is the only "Wu Yuan Family Treasure" personally written by Wu Yuanzi. On the mountain ridges on the left and right behind the temple, two halls of the same size were built, the left enshrines Guanyin, and the right enshrines Qiu Zu. From these places, you can also see the color of Buddhism mixed into Taoism. For example, although Qingcheng Mountain is a famous teaching mountain, there are also Buddhist temples; in addition to enshrining the statue of Lao Tzu in the main hall of Shangqing Palace, Confucius is also enshrined, and Confucian colors also sneak in. Behind Guanyin Hall is a paifang, Yan Yue: Up the sky ladder, and then up to Fengyue Ridge, the strange rocks are craggy, quite artistic. Going up from Fengyue Ridge to the Yuanyuan Temple, also known as the Black Tiger Temple, enshrines the gods who cut down demons and subdue demons, with dark faces and hideous shapes. There is a pavilion behind, which can be used for rest. A new pavilion is being built on the nearby cliff, facing several ancient pine trees, standing like a cover, the secluded and charming is very similar to the small stone platform in the Lion Forest of Huangshan. There is a row of small houses on the upper left, with two caves in the middle: one is the Two Immortals Cave, and the other is the Three Saints Cave. The Two Immortals Cave enshrines the statues of Qin and Li Erxian, who were both born in the Qingyuan period of the Song Dynasty and built thatched cottages in Chaoyang Cave on this mountain. Li Xian's name was Yuanhui, and later changed to Zhitong, and served as a Jianyi doctor; Qin Xian claimed to be a eunuch in the Qin Dynasty, and later changed his name to Zitong. Why did they become monks? Although it is impossible to verify, the personalities and backgrounds of the two people can be seen from their posthumous poems. Li Xian has a sad poem: "Wealth and fame have not been mentioned for a long time, my heart is cold and I learn to be obsessed, I have no human affairs recently, I want to live in the depths of Yunshan." Qin Xian's poem: "The dangerous pavilion leans against the heavy ridge, the fine rain is misty and the jade steps are long, the winding blue stream flows through the night rain, and the red leaves on both sides of the mountain reflect the setting sun." Setting sun should be a mistake for setting sun. After going around the mountain behind the Two Immortals Cave to Lingguan Temple, and then up to the Seven Zhen Temple, there are seventeen statues. Above is a stela game, named: Santai Ridge. One mile to the right is Wangmu Palace, and to the south of the palace is Chaoyang Cave, where Qin and Li Erxian practiced. A few dozen steps forward, there is another stela building, named: Silence. A corner of the dangerous building, hanging high on the cliff, is named Baiyunwo, which contains a reclining Buddha statue. Further up is Shouxing Nunnery, and the south slope is Leizu Hall. Continuing south, there is Zizaiwo, the statue of Wu Yuanzi. On the right wall in front of the cave are two steles, which are Wu Yuanzi's self-titled prescription for medicine and palindrome poem. These Taoist relics and crooked poems can be found everywhere in the famous mountains of the world, and they are not surprising; what is surprising is that next to Zizaiwo is a small earthen house, the roof is spiral, small at the top and large at the bottom, in the shape of gossip, and it is said that Wu Yuanzi wrote books and refined elixir here. Following the stone steps up, there is Wu Yuanzi's library, which is now closed. Wu Yuanzi's surname is Liu and his name is Yiming, he is from Woxian, Shanxi, and is also known as Supuzi and Beiyang Sanren. According to legend, in the Yiyou year of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty, he passed by Yuzhong and visited the relics of Qin and Li Erxian in Qiyun Mountain, and then settled here to study Taoism and cultivate hard for more than forty years before he ascended to immortality. His life's writings and annotations are like a forest, such as: Three Yi Zhu Lue, Zhou Yi Jin Zhen, Diamond Sutra Jie Mu, Heart Sutra Jie Yun, Xiuzhen Jiu Yao, Shenbao Ba De, and Qiyun Notes, etc. Taoist books have long been incomplete. The grand hall at the top of the mountain is named Hunyuan Pavilion, with a hexagonal pillar that reaches the sky, which is considered the peak.

Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Housing Disputes Involve Mutual Lawsuits Courts Delay for a Long Time

Yang Rishi asked: A has a shop that was rented to B in the 25th year of the Republic of China. A contract was signed at the time, and B paid a deposit of 200 yuan. In the 33rd year, A wanted to take it back for his own use, but B did not agree. After mediation, B continued to rent for two years until the expiration of the term in March of the 36th year. B still refused to return the property. A then sued the court for a ruling. In the first instance, B lost the case and was ordered to move out within a time limit. The deposit was refunded by A at a rate of 2,500 times. B refused to accept the appeal. The second instance rejected the appeal. B refused to accept it and appealed to the Third Instance Court. B used the fact that he had repaired the facade during the lease period and forged accounting books to claim compensation from A. There are several questions now. Please give detailed answers: (1) Can the Third Instance Court uphold the original judgment; and execute it immediately? (2) Can A claim compensation from B for the losses suffered due to B's unreasonable lawsuit? (3) Can A prosecute B for the crime of forging documents for forging accounting books? (4) The Third Instance Court has been delaying this case for as long as ten months. Can A request a quick judgment?

[Legal Counsel Mr. Tang Mingshi's answer] (1) The Third Instance Court is a legal review. If the application of the law is correct, it should uphold the original judgment. The Third Instance Court is the final instance, and its judgment can be executed. (2) If A has suffered damage due to B's unreasonable lawsuit, he can naturally claim compensation. (3) If A can prove that B forged accounting books, he can prosecute for the crime of forging or altering documents according to the Criminal Law. (4) The Supreme Court of the Third Instance has many cases, and delays are inevitable. There is no other method other than requesting a judgment.

### Clarification of Military Service Questions from Mr. Pan Zhongren, Answered by the Civil Affairs Bureau

(1) The military service investigation of men's families is conducted by the township (town) office every year within the prescribed period.

This procedure must be carried out once every year.

(2) Students graduating from high school or above are not subject to general conscription orders. This city began in January of this year. According to the rules of the order, there are provisions that do not apply retroactively, and it seems difficult to apply for the 36th year. This telegram order was approved for implementation on a special project and was not listed in Article XX of the Military Service Law.

(3) The active military service man is stipulated to be five years old. In addition to the five years, there is no need to apply.

(4) If the township (town) chief has military service corruption, he can report it to the local government and the battalion (4) garrison headquarters.
