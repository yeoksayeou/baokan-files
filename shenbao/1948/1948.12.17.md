### Important Developments in the Bengbu-Suxian Battle Situation: Huang-Li Army Corps Complete Convergence; National Army in Xiao-Yong Area Captures Gengzhuang

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] When answering inquiries at a press conference on the 16th, Deng Wenyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, stated: (1) Du Yuming's troops, leading approximately 180,000 men from Xuzhou southward, and Huang Wei's army corps, still numbering 80,000 men, are still separated by 35 to 40 kilometers. Huang's forces are approximately 20 kilometers away from the Li army corps, which is advancing northward from Bengbu. (Note: According to a special dispatch from our Bengbu office, Huang's army corps broke through and reached the designated location at 5:00 PM on the 16th.) Du Yuming's southward-advancing troops are progressing at a rate of 3 to 5 kilometers per day due to enemy resistance. (2) Lin Biao's bandit troops north of Beiping number approximately seven columns, while Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops south of Beiping number approximately eight columns. Lin's bandits have another three columns near Tangshan.

[Our Bengbu Office, 16th] Important developments occurred in the Bengbu-Suxian battlefield today. Huang Wei's army corps, which had been defending Shuangduiji for 20 days, began to break through last night. One route was led by Hu Lian, making a frontal assault towards the southeast, while Huang Wei led another unit on his left flank in the same direction. According to tonight's news, the breakout troops made contact with the Suppression Headquarters here at 5:00 PM this afternoon, and both major forces have reached safe areas. General Hu Lian, commanding the battle from inside a tank, was wounded by enemy artillery fire and is currently receiving treatment in Bengbu.

[Our Bengbu Office, 16th] According to prisoner of war confessions, Liu Bocheng ordered his soldiers on the 7th of this month to prepare seven days' worth of supplies, with the intention of crushing Huang's army corps before the 14th. Due to the valiant and bloody fighting of our brave soldiers, although the Huang army corps' position has shrunk, it has not wavered. Huang's army corps' ability to hold out until the 15th has effectively shattered the enemy's dreams, and the military authorities' decision to have Huang's army corps break through at this time, after exhausting the stubborn bandits, is naturally an excellent opportunity. Regarding the battle situation of the breakout, according to air force reconnaissance reports, before 3:00 PM today, the air force had not discovered any signs between the Hui and Xie rivers. The vicinity of Shuangduiji was very quiet, and there were no air-to-air communication signals, which further proves that the troops had already left. Therefore, the military here was very anxious at that time. The news of the Huang army corps' completed breakthrough was released tonight. According to reporters, the unit suffered only one-half casualties during the 20 days of fighting in Shuangduiji, and this also includes a portion of the rebels. Losses during the breakout process were also minimal, and did not affect its original strong combat effectiveness.

[Our Bengbu Office, 16th] Since Liu Zhi flew to Nanjing on the 13th to seek instructions, returned to Bengbu on the evening of the 14th, and went to the front line for inspection on the 15th, Liu's actions have shown us that there will be decisive changes in the current battle situation. According to military sources, after Yang Gancai's army joined the battlefield in front of Li Yannian, a full-scale attack was launched today. The bandits between Baojiaji and Xinji have retreated to the northwest, but Huang's army corps has already broken through. The fighting on the southern front has obviously decreased, and its importance, according to observations by military authorities, is that the National Army may henceforth hold the natural barrier of the river and defend Huainan.

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] On the 16th, Li Yannian's army corps fired on the bandit troops in Cui Zhuang from Gaowangji, and captured Cui Zhuang by evening. Approximately 20,000 bandits are facing Li's army corps, moving in groups of 1,000 or 2,000 towards the northwest. This was discovered by air force groups led by Deputy Commander Wang Shuming, who strafed and bombed them, inflicting heavy casualties. Also: On the morning of the 16th, 3,000 bandit troops moved from Zhao Ji towards Banqiao Ji (north of Yingshang County on the west side of the Fei River), and were heavily damaged by the discovery of the Shenying.

[Our Bengbu Office, 16th] There will be important changes in the current battle situation. The situation here tonight is still very stable; however, there are still many people leaving for the south. Military vehicles are speeding through the streets, giving a slight sense of tension.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Military news: Huang Wei and Li Yannian's army corps converged on the afternoon of the 16th. Li's army corps attacked the bandits in front of them after capturing Baojiaji, then entered Fangdianzi and met with Huang Wei's army corps, which had launched an attack from Shuangduiji. Since the beginning of the Suxian-Bengbu battle, Huang Wei's army corps has used Shuangduiji and Dayingji as bases between the Bei Fei and Hui rivers, absorbing more than 100,000 enemy troops from Liu's 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 10th Columns, as well as Chen Geng's 7th Column, preventing them from disengaging from the battlefield. Under the intense fire and continuous bombing by our infantry, artillery, and air force, the bandits have suffered heavy losses. After being attacked by Li Yannian's army corps advancing northward, the bandits in front could no longer resist and collapsed towards Suxian in a panic.

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of National Defense announced tonight that Huang Wei's 12th Army Corps has broken through the encirclement and converged with Li Yannian's 6th Army Corps northwest of Bengbu.

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] From morning to evening on the 16th, air force squadrons, commanded by Deputy Commander Wang Shuming in a B-25 aircraft, carried out bombing in the Xiao-Yong area. By evening, Du Yuming's troops took the opportunity during the air raids to shell Gengzhuang, setting it on fire, and captured it.

### Ministry of National Defense Releases Weekly War Report

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of National Defense has recently released the weekly war report from the 9th to the 15th as follows:

(1) East China Theater

In the Bengbu-Suxian area, our main forces and the communist bandits are engaged in a major battle, currently taking place in three areas. One is in the area east of Yongcheng and west of Suxian, where our main force is the army corps led by Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming, moving south from Xuzhou. The communist bandits in this area are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, Liangguang, Luzhongnan, and Rapid Columns belonging to Chen Yi. Starting from the 13th, our troops, in close coordination with land, air, and tanks, launched a southward attack from the northeast area of Yongcheng, and routed the 3rd and 8th Columns of bandits entrenched in the Weiliu and Sunge areas. On the 15th, they fiercely attacked the bandits stubbornly defending the two major strongholds of Lilou and Guolou, and have already captured them, continuing their southward advance. Reinforcements for the bandit forces in this area are military region troops and supplementary regiments from northern Jiangsu, central Shandong, Jiaodong, eastern Henan, and other places, most of whom are newly conscripted soldiers recently coerced into service, and are all exhausted. They have been fiercely attacked by the National Army one after another and suffered heavy casualties. In the past few days, more than 70,000 wounded bandits have been transported north through Suxian. Their main force is currently concentrated in Zhangxikou, Miaoqiao, and Dingji (northwest of Suxian), catching their breath and reorganizing. Our southward army corps is steadily advancing south, constantly attacking the bandits.

Another battle area, centered around the Bianduiji and Taiyingji areas southwest of Suxian, is the Yellow We Corps of the National Army. The bandits facing them are the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 11th Columns of Liu Bocheng's bandit force, and Chen's 7th Column, totaling about 100,000 men. Due to repeated heavy blows from our army's land and air forces, they have suffered heavy losses. Currently, Liu's offensive has been thwarted, and they are building layers of fortifications to prevent the National Army from advancing. In recent days, both sides have been shelling each other with heavy artillery. Our Yellow Corps is strong and brave, fighting more and more fiercely, and has launched attacks for several consecutive days, capturing more than a dozen surrounding villages, and the distance from the northward army corps is getting closer and closer.

Thirdly, in the area around XInji and Baojiaji southwest of Guzhen, our northward army, in coordination with newly-equipped tank units, crossed the Heji Huoshenmiao line on the 10th and captured Baojiaji and Gaojiaji on the 15th, creating a major breakthrough on the southern front. The bandits facing them are the 6th Column of Chen Yi and three brigades of Liu Bocheng's 2nd and 9th Columns, all of whom have suffered heavy losses and have been routed. Recently, the 11th Division of the Bohai Column and independent regiments of the Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan Army, etc., have been urgently transferred from east of Jinan to reinforce them, and they are still resisting step by step. In order to seize the good opportunity to annihilate the bandits, fresh troops are constantly joining the battlefield. The communist bandit forces in the Suxian-Bengbu area are trying to escape, and will inevitably suffer an unprecedentedly heavy blow.

The Bengbu-Suxian campaign began on November 26th and has lasted for 20 days. A total of more than 120,000 bandits have been killed, wounded, or captured. More than 4,000 bandits have surrendered to us or been captured. We have seized more than 4,000 rifles, more than 200 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 200 horses. The National Army has suffered approximately 45,000 casualties, a ratio of one to three with the bandits.

According to the confessions of captured bandits, the bandit forces on all fronts have been experiencing a severe shortage of food and ammunition in recent days. The stretcher bearers and civilian laborers in the rear have all been forcibly incorporated into the bandit army. Most of the horse and ox carts transporting food and ammunition have been destroyed by our air force. More than half of the veteran soldiers of the bandit army have been lost, so morale is extremely low. Currently, the only supplies they rely on are the grain confiscated from the people in Suqian, the Hongze Lake area, and eastern Henan. They only eat a small amount of miscellaneous grains and beans every day, which is not a large amount, so the bandit army is suffering from fatigue and hunger. Given the opportunity, they will voluntarily surrender to us. The National Army, on the other hand, has convenient air and vehicle transportation for supplies, and morale is very high, so the battle in the Suxian-Bengbu area will become more and more favorable.

(2) North China Theater

In the Zhangjiakou area, after Nie Rongzhen's bandit forces launched a surprise attack on Zhangjiakou and were repelled by our army, the National Army launched an attack from Zhangjiakou on the 10th to expand the results of the victory. The remnants of the bandit forces near Laohushan in the southeast of Zhangjiakou and Wulaha in the northwest of Zhangjiakou have mostly fled south. The bandits who fled to the vicinity of Xinbaoan are being fiercely attacked by the powerful National Army. Now, the National Army, in response to the demands of the people of Chahar Province, is still leaving a unit to garrison Zhangjiakou. The periphery of Zhangjiakou has been very peaceful in recent days.

In the eastern Hebei area, the National Army has completed a new deployment. Tang was actively evacuated on the 12th and has now strengthened the defense of the Pingjin-Tanggu triangular area, waiting for an opportunity to strike the bandits. Currently, the 1st, 2nd, and 6th Columns of Lin Biao's bandit forces that entered the pass are scurrying near Fengrun in northwestern Tangshan. The 3rd Column is harassing the Langfang area in the northern section of the Pingjin Railway. The 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Columns, and the 7th Independent Division, are scurrying in the Miyun, Shunyi, and Great Wall areas in the northwest of Beiping. Each of these bandit units is now drafting men on the spot to replenish their numbers and registering grain and supplies. No major battles have occurred yet. From the 14th, skirmishes have occurred in the vicinity of Qinghe, Wanshoushan, and Shijingshan in the western suburbs of Peiping, as the bandits are probing and disrupting. The strong National Army units stationed in these areas have repelled the bandit's disruptive raids. The order of Peiping is as stable as ever.

In the Taiyuan area, there have been no major battles this week. The National Army on the southeastern front launched an attack on the 13th and routed a bandit force northwest of Qianjiafen, with a great harvest. The National Army on the southwestern front searched and suppressed the area southwest of Baijiazhuang on the 14th. A part of the 38th Brigade of bandits was killed or wounded by us, totaling more than 300 men. In addition, the 4th New Brigade, 69th Brigade, and Taihang Independent Brigade, etc., have suffered heavy casualties and have fled to Qingyuan and other places for reorganization. Our air force has repeatedly flown over the bandit's rear and carried out fierce bombing and strafing, with excellent results.

### Editorial: Opening of Emergency Industrial Loans

Emergency industrial loans have been opened, and the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee began reviewing the applications of various manufacturers for wage loans on the 13th. The Rediscount Committee announced that the opening of this industrial loan is "to meet the urgent needs of production and export business." The loan method is divided into two types: "purchasing finished products" and "pledging and releasing soft loans," with purchasing as the main method. The detailed method of purchasing finished products has been formulated and announced by the Rediscount Committee on the 13th, as detailed in this newspaper on the 14th. Regarding the method of pledging and releasing soft loans, it is said that it still needs to be applied to the Rediscount Committee through national banks or commercial banks and money houses, but the operating conditions of the manufacturers and the need for assistance should be thoroughly investigated by the undertaking bank or money house. Finally, the amount of the loan and its use after the loan are approved. If it is used for non-productive purposes or other improper circumstances, no loan will be granted. The interest rate of this industrial loan is stipulated to be calculated at 80% of the interest rate approved by commercial banks and money houses, and the Central Bank will rediscount it at 90%, with the rediscount rate reduced by three points from the loan interest rate; the loan term is stipulated to be 30 days, which may be extended if necessary. This strict loan method is intended to prevent manufacturers from using cheap funds and truly achieve the purpose of rescuing manufacturers.

The Shanghai industrial community, which has suffered many disasters, has encountered many new difficulties in recent months. First, during the price control period, due to the government's strict inspection of warehouses, restrictions on inventory, and the public's scramble to purchase goods, the reserves of various factories have reached a very empty state. Under this buying frenzy, Shanghai's materials flowed out in torrents, but the raw materials needed by various manufacturers could not be obtained steadily due to the price controls. In order to cope with this dilemma, they either stopped work and reduced production, or even reduced operations, but the factory's management expenses and salary expenses were not greatly reduced as a result. Not only were wages not reduced, but also because of the sharp rise in the prices of daily necessities, the cost of living index continued to rise, and wages also increased accordingly. On the other hand, due to the evolution of the war situation, a large amount of funds flowed south, interest rates were high, and product costs continued to increase. Under these circumstances, Shanghai industry faced many difficulties and was almost facing a desperate situation. Therefore, how to solve this difficult problem of Shanghai industry, preserve national vitality, and even gradually increase production, is not only something that the industrial community should strive to do, but also a responsibility that the government authorities cannot shirk.

The Shanghai Industrial Association stated this difficulty to the Ministry of Finance and requested the authorities to immediately approve emergency industrial loans to save the industrial crisis. The Industrial Association requested two points. (1) The amount of loans requested by each factory should be based on the wages of each factory for two months, with a total amount of 1 billion yuan; (2) Please use the factory's houses and machines as collateral for the loan, instead of raw materials and finished products. From the perspective of active use of industrial and commercial capital, these two requests from the Industrial Association have their clear intentions; however, in order to curb the abundance of speculative funds in the market and the rise in prices, the government authorities should use the two methods of "purchasing finished products" and "pledging and releasing soft loans" as a prudent measure, and can use loans to achieve the purpose of promoting production. The industrial community did not express satisfaction with the purchase of finished products and high interest rates, because these two methods have too much control over industrial activities, and the industrial loans obtained are only enough to take a breath, and cannot truly promote production. In fact, the government's opening of industrial loans this time was forced by the appeals of the industrial community. It is a kind of rescue measure that is a last resort, rather than truly implementing a policy to support national industry. This kind of industrial loan similar to rescue is just like the emergency industrial loan that the government handled in Chongqing in 1945, the production loan at the end of 1946, and the method of purchasing finished products from manufacturers at the end of last year's lunar New Year. Its spirit and content are almost completely consistent, and they are all temporary rescue loans.

As mentioned above, this kind of temporary rescue industrial loan is only enough for manufacturers in critical condition to take a breath—whether they can breathe is still unknown—and cannot truly promote industrial production. We believe that in order to preserve the national industry in the flames of war, the government authorities should have a set of methods to preserve and stabilize industry, formulate a longer-term loan policy, so as to achieve the purpose of truly promoting production. It is true that the opening of industrial loans has the effect of fueling inflation, but if the method of "purchasing finished products" is used reasonably, it can prevent the drawbacks of hoarding with loans and curbing the abundance of speculative funds in the market. There are still many methods for technical application, and overcoming difficulties is not difficult. As long as the government authorities are determined and do not pay too much attention to small-scale plans, they will naturally create a path to support national industry.

The specific detailed methods are being formulated by the Ministry in conjunction with the Central Bank. The loan methods are not limited to order loans, the loan targets should be strictly defined, the loan interest rate is proposed to be appropriately reduced compared to the market interest rate, and the loan procedures should be simplified as much as possible.

### International Tribunal Has Judged Japanese War Criminals, US Supreme Court Has No Right to Accept, US Government and Far East Commission State Positions, US Deputy Prosecutor General Requests Rejection at Supreme Court's First Hearing

[News Report] Washington Broadcasting: US Deputy Attorney General Pullman formally notified the Supreme Court today, stating: US courts have no right to accept appeals from Japanese war criminals already judged by international tribunals. Mr. Pullman, from the standpoint of the government's executive branch, expressed the US government's deep concern about this matter, believing that if the Supreme Court rashly accepts appeals from Japanese war criminals, it will inevitably lead to international disputes and extremely unpleasant consequences. Even the activities of the United Nations organization will be adversely affected, because the various activities of the United Nations organization require harmonious cooperation among countries.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] The US government today earnestly requested the Supreme Court not to interfere with the Far East Tribunal's judgment on seven Japanese war criminals, on the grounds that if the Supreme Court interferes, it will be overstepping the Far East Tribunal's privileges, and the result will be to undermine any peaceful and reasonable resolution of international disputes and damage the activities of the United Nations organization. Deputy Attorney General Pullman was ordered to appear in court today to argue, requesting the court to reject the appeals of the Japanese war criminals. The court heard arguments for three hours today and scheduled a continued hearing on the 18th, or may pronounce judgment. If no judgment is pronounced, it will be held again on January 3 next year.

### Rumor has it that the US has issued a new note to the Netherlands, advocating the resumption of Dutch-Indonesian negotiations. Indonesia has issued a communique expressing its willingness to resolve peacefully with the Netherlands

[United Press, Paris, 16th] A spokesman for the US delegation said today that the United States may call on the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Indonesian issue. There is a good opportunity to discuss this case when the Security Council meets on the 17th.

[United Press, The Hague, 16th] The Dutch government today denied that Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta's recent note could serve as the basis for resuming Dutch-Indonesian negotiations.

[United Press, The Hague, 15th] It is heard that the Dutch government has received a new note from the US State Department regarding the Indonesian issue, the content of which believes that the Dutch-Indonesian dispute can still be resolved through negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Mediation Group. The US Embassy has not yet confirmed this news. The Dutch cabinet has been discussing the Indonesian issue for three days, but no decision has been made yet.

[US Information Service, Washington, 15th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett held a press conference today. When asked about the Indonesian situation, Lovett pointed out that the United States is one of the members of the United Nations Mediation Committee and is making efforts to stop the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia from becoming friends again. When asked whether Dutch-Indonesian negotiations have been resumed, Lovett said: He did not know, but said that news from The Hague said that the recent note issued by Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta has temporarily suspended the issuance of an order related to the Indonesian Federal Government. (On Saturday, the Netherlands announced that continuing negotiations under the Mediation Committee would be "useless" and said that the Netherlands would establish a temporary Indonesian Federal Government outside the areas occupied by the Republic, but the door for the Republic to join this Federal Government would remain open.)

[Agence France-Presse, Yogyakarta, 16th] The Republic of Indonesia issued a communique today, emphasizing that a peaceful resolution of the dispute between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia is the only way, because the United Nations Mediation Committee has failed to complete its desired hopes, which is now obvious. The communique also stated that the Netherlands, which decided to establish a temporary Indonesian Federal Government, did not comply with the Renville Agreement, took actions contrary to the Security Council resolution of August 1, 1947, and has been unwilling to work with the Mediation Committee since October. The communique refuted the Netherlands' attacks at length.

He summarized recent defense measures to reporters, saying that he has (1) appointed senior scientific and military leaders to study all types of weapons, including the atomic bomb; (2) ordered all military transport ships, including the 260 ships of the Department of the Army, to form a unit under the command of the Department of the Navy; (3) drafted a plan to place all military transportation on the ground under the management of the Department of the Army; (4) prepared for the Army, Navy, and Air Force to jointly use conscription facilities and manpower throughout the country; and (5) recommended to President Truman that the Air Defense Force be federalized and merged with the Air Force Reserve.

### Soviet Spies Steal Secret Documents, Second Batch Announced, Soviet Spies Pay Attention to US Foreign Policy

[United Press, Washington, 16th] The House Un-American Activities Committee released the second batch of 26 State Department documents stolen by Soviet spies on the 16th. The documents revealed that State Department officials secretly concealed US trade negotiations with Hitler before the 1938 election to alleviate the Democratic administration's political unease. It is said that one of the documents was personally transcribed by Hiss. This is equivalent to the fact that the State Department archives were stolen by a Red spy ring ten years ago. In addition to the above-mentioned secret, it also shows (1) that the spy ring's interest was concentrated on the US's foreign policy towards the two major continents of Europe and Asia; (2) that six months before the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, the State Department obtained the secret of Hitler's plan to conquer Czechoslovakia; and (3) that French officials believed in early 1938 that the US and Japan would inevitably go to war. These documents were all submitted to the Non-American Activities Committee by Chambers, a defector communist writer. Chambers said that this is part of the two hundred documents that Hiss stole while working in the State Department and handed over to him. The State Department has not elaborated on the trade negotiations with Germany in 1938. However, according to diplomatic sources, these secret negotiations did take place in mid-1938. According to reports, when Germany insisted on placing the trade agreement on a barter system, then Secretary of State Hull decided to suspend the negotiations. In the 21 documents that have already been released, it is known that two of them have been confirmed to be handwritten by Hiss.

### Former US State Department Official Hiss Sentenced to Perjury for Lying During Confrontation with Chambers

[United Press, New York, 15th] Alger Hiss, a former State Department policy planner, was sentenced to perjury by a federal judge on the 15th. He was accused of handing over secret State Department documents to Chambers for delivery to the Soviet Union. Due to legal regulations, the federal judge's 18-month investigation of pre-war Communist spy cases should end today. The judge ruled six hours before the end of the period that Hiss was guilty of two counts of perjury. Because of the legal limitations of a three-year term, the federal judge could not sentence Hiss for espionage. The verdict stated that Hiss was lying when he testified that he had not handed over government documents to Chambers and that he had not seen Chambers since January 1, 1937. Prosecutor McGohey said: "We can prove that Hiss was lying when he said that he had never handed over these documents to Chambers. All we need to prove is that he was lying, not that he handed over secret documents." The maximum penalty for the above two counts of perjury is five years in prison and a fine of US$2,000 each. The House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington said that this verdict "ends one stage of our investigation into Communist spy cases."

### Defending Shanghai Requires 300 Million in Funds; Agreement on Three Measures for Raising Self-Defense Special Tax; All Sectors Generously Pledge Donations at Tea Party

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Self-Defense Special Tax Fundraising Committee was formally established yesterday. Wu Guozhen, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiluan, Chen Daqing, and others, in order to promote the launch of the self-defense special tax, held a tea party at 4 PM yesterday on the 14th floor of the International Hotel, inviting people from all walks of life, including Liu Gongyun, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Gu Zhuxuan, Ma Shaoquan, Zhu Zhuyi, Xie Renzhao, Qin Runqing, Hu Xiyuan, Tian Liqian, and dozens of others. Mayor Wu presided over the tea party. After the chairman's report, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiluan, Wang Xiaolai, Ma Shaoquan, and others delivered speeches respectively. Three specific fundraising measures were immediately passed: (1) Starting from New Year's Day next year, the city's land value tax will be increased by 0.5%, estimated to yield around 120 million yuan. (2) The method of collecting donations from the industrial and commercial sectors to support the troops will be changed to collecting self-defense special tax, and the collection will continue. (3) Goods sealed during the price control period in this city will be subject to a 10% levy as a self-defense special tax. People from all sectors present at the scene expressed their willingness to donate. The speeches of Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and others at the tea party are recorded below:

Mayor Wu stated: Defending Shanghai is a matter for all Shanghai citizens. There have been many rumors these past two days, indicating that everyone hopes for stability, so self-defense is essential. There are two sources of rumors: one is the anxiety of the people, which easily leads to rumors, and the other is the intentional spreading of rumors by the communist bandits to shake people's hearts. After I and Speaker Pan contacted the central government yesterday, it was confirmed that all rumors were unfounded. The Huang-Li corps has already joined forces, and the morale of the troops at the front is extremely high. A belief in victory must be established, and then Shanghai can be defended. The Yangtze River has long been known as a natural barrier, and with the navy and air force in our hands, how will the communist bandits come? The urgent task now is how to defend Shanghai. I hope citizens will use their escape funds as self-defense special taxes, because defense requires huge funds. Based on current prices, it is estimated that at least 300 million yuan will be needed. Shanghai is a land of wealth, and I believe there will be no problem. If all Shanghai citizens do their best, I believe that not only can we safely get through this Lunar New Year, but also next year, the year after, and the entire situation can be without worry. I now propose three specific suggestions: (1) Land is gold, and defending Shanghai is also protecting land. I suggest increasing the land value tax by 0.5% to be used as a special relief tax. (2) Consolidating Shanghai will allow industry and commerce to prosper, so I hope that the industrial and commercial sectors can share the burden and use the troop support donations as self-defense special taxes. (3) Goods sealed during the price control period, according to the law, should be returned if there is no illegal activity, but current prices have risen more than tenfold, which is equivalent to the government hoarding them on their behalf. Therefore, I propose that 10% of them be used as a self-defense special tax to contribute to the local area, which is also reasonable. I hope people from all walks of life will actively promote this.

Pan Gongzhan Believes Strengthening Police Training is Necessary to Stabilize Shanghai

Speaker Pan Gongzhan said in his speech: Shanghai is a very important place. If the citizens of Shanghai are willing to work together with the government to seek self-rescue and national salvation, not only can Shanghai maintain stability, but the entire national situation can also be turned around. I hope citizens will not miss this opportunity to fulfill their responsibility to the country and to themselves, and become a model for the rest of the country. Defending Shanghai requires funds. The mayor estimates that it will require about 300 million, but in fact, it may exceed this amount. Yesterday, I discussed with various parties how to stabilize Shanghai and believe that it is first necessary to strengthen the training of the Shanghai police. (1) The use of weapons must be fully proficient; (2) The number of security police must be increased; (3) Police salaries must be raised so that they can live in stability and fulfill their duties to defend. I believe that under the leadership of Mayor Wu and Director Yu, the Shanghai police administration has made great progress, but I also hope that Shanghai can establish a new atmosphere to obtain the assistance of talent from friendly countries. For example, in training police, it may be necessary to hire foreign experts as consultants. We Chinese often have a misguided sense of arrogance, believing that hiring foreign advisors hinders sovereignty, but this is not the case. When the Soviet Union implemented its five-year plans, it borrowed talent from other countries. It is always right to learn with an open mind. As long as the people of Shanghai can truly work together and show our self-help achievements with practical actions, international perceptions will change. We must know that to get help from others, we must first help ourselves. This is a matter of course. If Shanghai's self-defense work is outstanding, friendly countries will definitely come to help in the future. Recalling the January 28th and August 13th wars of resistance, the people of Shanghai donated money to save the country and donated goods to support the troops. Today, we only see people rushing to withdraw gold and silver, obstructing traffic, and affecting order. The difference is vast, which is alarming. Therefore, I believe that those who withdraw gold and silver may also consider levying a self-defense special tax. As long as the collected donations are truly used to defend the people, defend the local area, and defend the country, all collection methods can be reasonably implemented.

Du Yuesheng Hopes People from All Sectors Will Work Together to Help Defend the Area

Du Yuesheng continued: To defend the area, we must strengthen local forces. To build local forces, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. Only after the area is stabilized can Shanghai prosper. If you are unwilling to contribute money now, it will naturally be impossible to ask for protection in the future. Therefore, I hope people from all sectors will work together to complete this task. Subsequently, Xu Jiluan, Wang Xiaolai, and others delivered speeches one after another. Ma Shaoquan, on behalf of the real estate industry, promised to increase the land value tax by 0.5%. Other industries also volunteered to donate. It was decided to establish a Self-Defense Special Tax Fundraising Committee, and all future related matters will be handled by the committee. The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM.

As for the corpses recovered and placed in the Siming Public Hall, as of yesterday, there were still 48 male corpses, 27 female corpses, and 86 infant corpses that no one has claimed. Because the corpses will soon decompose, the aftermath committee first collected them yesterday and took special photos to allow family members to identify and claim them in the future. Li Baixian and others, representatives of the families of the Jiangya Steamer disaster passengers, yesterday entrusted lawyer Xiao Zhenkai to send a letter to various aftermath relief agencies and fellow associations, suggesting four points: (1) Regarding the thorough investigation of the cause of the disaster, it is advocated to invite famous maritime experts, shipbuilding engineers, ship surveyors, marine engineers, responsible officials of the maritime administration, local impartial gentry, representatives of the China Merchants Bureau, and representatives of the families of the victims to form a committee to conduct an on-site inspection and impartially determine the responsibility for this destruction and sinking. However, the number of representatives of the deceased families shall not be less than 40% of the total number of attendees. (2) Corpses should not be claimed unless the family members provide conclusive evidence to prevent villains from fraudulently claiming them for profit. (3) Valuables found on the corpses should be properly preserved, but if the family members identify the physical evidence as correct, they may be allowed to find a guarantor to take them back and should not be made difficult in order to maintain property rights. (4) Before damage compensation and maritime disaster condolences are paid according to law, those victims' families who are poor, miserable, and helpless, or whose widows, orphans, and elderly are abandoned, should have their actual situation verified and receive a temporary emergency relief fund to extend their lives.

### Zhang Hanting's Motor Sailboat Performs Another Righteous Deed; Rescues Six Fishermen from a Sunken Boat En Route from Haimen to Shanghai

Zhang Hanting's motor sailboat "Jinyuanli," which risked its life to rescue more than 450 passengers from the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangya Steamer disaster, performed another righteous rescue yesterday. The ship's bow was damaged when it rescued the distressed passengers of the Jiangya Steamer a few days ago and was sent to Haimen for repairs. It set sail for Shanghai after the work was completed on the 15th. When passing through the waters of Yushan (homophone) Yangmian Wuqishan Wujiaoyu, it discovered six fishermen who had encountered a boat crash and were calling for help on Wujiaoyu. Upon seeing this, the motor sailboat ordered five strong men to drive a small boat to rescue them, and they safely arrived in Shanghai together. The six fishermen, who were in danger of being swallowed by the giant waves, were rescued. The names of the six people are recorded as follows: Yan Yuande, Hu Deren, Hu Yuede, Yu Agen, Li Shijiu, Chen Asi. According to reports, they set sail from Yangshan on the "Jinjixiang" fishing boat on the 11th of last month with fresh beltfish and went to sell them in Yiyao Yingshengxiao. Three days later, they encountered wind and waves in the waters of Yushan, the rudder broke, and the boat crashed into Wuqishan and was shattered. Of the seven crew members, the accountant Yu Ruiyue, a native of Ningbo, died. The remaining six people drifted to Wujiaoyu with the waves, climbed to the top when the tide receded, and were rescued by the "Jinyuanli" motor sailboat, allowing them to celebrate their rebirth. They are deeply grateful, it is said.

### Ministry of Finance Plans to Formulate Handling Measures for Goods Imported Without a License and Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, Adopting Differential Treatment to Achieve Average Profit and Loss

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the special foreign currency deposit certificates that the government should give to the original importers as the price for purchasing goods arriving at the port and shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without a license, according to the original regulations, they should be allowed to offset foreign exchange for import payments or exchange for national currency at the market exchange rate. However, the implementing rules also stipulated that the original importers have the right of first refusal to purchase. As a result, some of the unlicensed goods purchased by the government are still preferentially purchased back by the original importers, some merchants originally intended to preferentially purchase back, but the government must forcibly purchase them, and some merchants requested to waive the right of first refusal and must be handled by the government for purchase. The conditions are different, and the degree of profit and loss varies. From a commercial point of view, it is not fair without adopting differential treatment. The Ministry of Finance convened the Central Bank and China Trust Bureau to formulate measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The content is as follows:

(1) For those who have been forcibly purchased or purchased by the government-designated agency after the original importer has preferentially purchased them, and the purpose of their import has not been achieved, they should be allowed to use the foreign currency deposit certificates they hold to offset foreign exchange for import payments, so as to still give them the opportunity to import. According to the implementing rules, special foreign currency deposit certificates should be used for six seasons starting from November of last year. Now that a year has passed and they have not yet started to be used, the original prescribed time limit is too long. Therefore, the special foreign currency deposit certificates will be allowed to be used in three seasons starting from the eighth season.

(2) For those who waive the right of first refusal to purchase by the original importer and are purchased by the government, although the purpose of their import has not been achieved, it must be due to unfavorable circumstances that they waived it. The government's purchase is not forced. Therefore, although they are allowed to use foreign currency deposit certificates to offset foreign exchange for import payments, the time limit will still be in accordance with the original regulations, and will be used in six seasons starting from the eighth season.

(3) Those who are preferentially purchased by the original importer are equivalent to allowing import in disguise. The government only has the name of purchase, and the merchant still obtains the profit of import. Therefore, there is no need to reuse their foreign currency deposit certificates. However, for the sake of fairness, it is stipulated: (1) Those who paid the price at the exchange rate of 474,000 yuan in national currency according to the original published price after June 1 of this year, their special foreign currency deposit certificates will still be issued gold yuan certificates at five times the exchange rate of the published price on May 31, at 1 jiao 5 fen 8 li per U.S. dollar in gold yuan, in one lump sum. (2) Those who paid the price at the designated bank's published price before May 31 of this year (without using the foreign exchange settlement certificate), all of their special foreign currency deposit certificates will be issued gold yuan bonds at the current exchange rate (one to twenty).

(4) For merchants who should pay for the goods delivered before November 11, and the profits of the importers were paid by the China Trust Bureau before that day, or the China Trust Bureau has issued a payment notice but the merchant deliberately does not collect it, they will still be calculated according to the August 19 published exchange rate, converted into national currency and then converted into gold yuan. Those who receive or pay after November 12 will be calculated at five times the above exchange rate.

### Various Non-Grain Items Decline, Rice Prices Plummet, High-Quality White Rice Retreats to 330 Yuan

### Raw Silk Slightly Firm, Rayon and Silk Fabrics Decline Again

Raw silk for export was slightly firmer due to the rise in foreign exchange transfer certificates. People's hearts were slightly firmer, and foreign merchants reopened their inventories.

The market was not smooth, and the table first advanced and then regressed. The price then stepped down. Meiya opened in the morning with an asking price of 9,500 yuan and 9,600 yuan. Floating scattered households constantly offset, and the dealers pushed up the price, raising the asking price to 10,200 yuan. In the middle, people's hearts suddenly softened, and all parties turned away after inventorying. The market atmosphere was soft, and it instantly fell back by 500 yuan. By the close of the market, the market outside the market fell again by 300-500 yuan. The asking price was very chaotic, and the trend was weak.

### Refugees in Zhenjiang Facing a Life-and-Death Crisis: Hoping for Understanding and Compassion

[Reported by our Zhenjiang correspondent on the 13th] There are two "many" things in Zhenjiang right now: The first is many refugees, and the second is many displaced students. First, let's talk about the refugees, most of whom come from the various counties of Xuzhou, as well as Funing, Lianshui, Pi County, Shiying, Suqian, Xinghua, Huaiyin, Huaian, Dongtai, Ganyu, and Quyu, all of whom have fled in batches to this poor and desolate Zhenjiang. Zhenjiang is the transshipment point for Jiangnan and Jiangbei. As a result, Zhenjiang has suddenly increased its population so much, which is really suffering.

The fellow townsmen associations of various counties in northern Jiangsu in Zhenjiang jointly sent a telegram to President Sun of the Executive Yuan and Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs on the 11th.

Detailing the Situation

Appealing to everyone to do what they can to provide reclamation, work relief, and introduce occupations, etc., to effectively help the refugees. The original text is as follows:

"Since arriving in the provincial capital, we have no food when hungry and no clothes when cold. We live in dilapidated temples and abandoned shrines, experiencing all the pain in the world, and are on the verge of death, with little concern. Even intermittent and sporadic

Partial Relief

Is like a timely rain in a long drought, which can't help much. Even begging for alms, rice is like pearls and firewood is like cinnamon. Everyone is unwilling to give to others, so where is there any leftover to give? We have no hope of returning to our hometown, and no way to beg for mercy. What chance do we have for survival? Rather than enduring hunger, cold, and pain, it would be better to die sooner! Human nature loves life and hates death, but now the refugees wish to die sooner, the depth of their hidden pain is clearly visible. Although the disaster area is wide, the number of people returning is still small. If everyone does what they can to provide reclamation, work relief, and introduce occupations, to disperse and support the refugees, and actively rescue them, it is not difficult. It is a pity that it has not been gradually realized to this day, causing our enthusiastic and loyal thousands of refugees to suffer unprecedented pain, and how can we not regret the desire to die quickly? It is not a pity that our refugee compatriots die, but it is related to the direction of people's hearts, which will not only make those who come feel discouraged, but also make those who have not yet come hesitant. The impact is unimaginable!"

The Provincial Winter Relief Committee previously launched a one-yuan donation campaign to help refugees, soliciting donations from all walks of life. Because the amount was very small, the propaganda was expanded to encourage citizens of the provincial capital to donate enthusiastically. Starting from today, six local newspapers were requested to publish promotional texts in the news section and collect donations on their behalf, which will be published daily. At the same time, five

Movie Theaters Donated

One day's income to help refugees.

When the 共匪 (Communist bandits) besieged Xuzhou this time, students from middle schools in various counties and cities in Xuzhou also fled to Zhenjiang to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, totaling three or four thousand people. When they left Xuzhou, the flames of war were everywhere, and they abandoned their luggage and all their clothes in a hurry, so the situation of these displaced students was very miserable, looking almost like refugees. The head of the Jiangsu Boy Scouts Council, with a sympathetic heart, generously lent large houses and kitchen equipment, providing as much as possible. Later, seeing the number of students increasing, they erected tents to solve the housing problem. The association also mobilized the Boy Scouts of the whole town to raise donations. Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts from various schools carried rice, vegetables, yams, fruits, and biscuits.

Gifts were given one after another

They also sang, performed, and danced for these students to listen to and watch. After being hungry, cold, exhausted, and displaced, the refugee students suddenly received this sympathetic comfort and material assistance, and their cold hearts gained infinite warmth. Everyone was moved to tears.

Later, after the Education Department and the Jiangsu Provincial Youth Guidance Office continuously requested instructions from the Ministry of Education, it was decided to establish

Temporary Middle Schools

And find ways to resume schooling in Danyang, Wuxi, Jurong and other places. As of today, the two temporary middle schools in Danyang and Wuxi have taken in more than 1,000 people, and the temporary middle school in Jurong is still starting to take in people. It is said that these students are very able to get along with all walks of life in the local area wherever they go. Events such as fighting, bloodshed, etc. will never happen, and they can set an example for all displaced schools.

### Merchants and Citizens of Hangzhou Petition for Tax Reduction: A Citizen Talks About What Happened

[Reported by this newspaper] On the 14th, more than 2,000 merchants and citizens in Hangzhou gathered in front of the City Council to petition against the city government's increase in business tax revenue and its business tax investigation methods. The situation was very chaotic. According to an objective account of the facts by a citizen familiar with the inside story: In order to evenly distribute the burden on citizens and prevent tax evasion, the city government plans to increase business tax by about 20 times the price limit with flexibility, and investigate the land prices in the urban area so that they are not lower than the farmland prices. The business tax of merchants should not be lower than the income tax of public school teachers. This is a fair and reasonable measure, but unexpectedly, merchants in Hangzhou have strongly opposed it.

As is well known, there were many unreasonable things in the past in Hangzhou in terms of tax payment. For example, Shen Changxing Ji, established by Shen Zhirong, the chairman of the cotton and egg industry council in Hangzhou, only paid five cents in August and 1.5 yuan in September. De Taihe Silk Shop, established by Cheng Xinjin, the chairman of the silk industry council and a councilor, only paid 7.5 yuan in August, 22.5 yuan in September, and 45 yuan in October, while public school teachers paid as much as five or six yuan per month in income tax.

This citizen familiar with the inside story added: The city government's measures to reorganize tax revenue and equalize the burden on citizens are very reasonable. In this turbulent era, the government should be able to work for the interests of the majority of people and break all inherited traditions. The people should support it. The petitioning drama in Hangzhou this time, the order of which was almost disrupted, suggests that there are others behind the scenes instigating this petitioning group, attempting to maintain their special interests and status.

Mayor Ren encountered this unpleasant incident at the beginning of his tenure. With Mayor Ren's youth, decisiveness, and courage to act, this petition incident will probably be the first test of Ren's democratic administration in Hangzhou.
