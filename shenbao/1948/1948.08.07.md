Editorial

### American Aid and Rural Reconstruction

The China-United States Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction has been established with the agreement of both China and the United States through an exchange of notes. The personnel have also been finalized and the commission will be established shortly. We have repeatedly read Ambassador Stuart's note and Foreign Minister Wang's reply in their entirety and deeply understand the great significance of the United States' economic assistance to China for rural reconstruction, gradually improving the economy, education, and health. As Ambassador Stuart said, "I sincerely hope that scholars studying Chinese society and economic problems will regard this day (August 5th) as a milestone in the path towards sound improvement of the situation in rural areas of China."

According to the provisions of the U.S. Foreign Aid Act, the portion of aid to China was originally $463 million, of which $125 million was for military aid and the remaining $338 million was for economic aid. Later, it was reduced to $400 million. Military aid remained unchanged, while economic aid was reduced to $275 million. Of this, nine-tenths will be used for emergency production and purchase of urgently needed food, cotton, chemical fertilizers, petroleum, and industrial equipment. The remaining one-tenth will be used for rural reconstruction in China. Because the former is of an emergency nature, only the rural reconstruction portion is for permanent construction purposes. Therefore, both China and the United States attach great importance to this matter. When the Chinese Economic Survey Group came east in early June to conduct on-site surveys and study construction plans, Dr. Merrill, an American agricultural expert, also came to investigate the agricultural and economic situation in China. The fact that China and the United States have agreed to establish the China-United States Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction shows that American assistance to China for rural reconstruction has moved from publicity and design to a concrete stage. All those who are concerned about the situation in rural China cannot but regard this as the most gratifying phenomenon at present.

China has historically been a country that "relies on agriculture." More than 80% of the country's population is farmers. Therefore, the adequacy or inadequacy of the people's food supply has often been the dividing line between order and chaos in Chinese history. However, in the past decade, the situation in rural China has deteriorated and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Before the War of Resistance, because farmers adhered to old ways and were self-enclosed, coupled with years of natural and man-made disasters, rural China had already declined. During the War of Resistance, the vast rural areas that fell under Japanese occupation were severely damaged and devastated by the enemy and their puppets. Even those that were fortunate enough not to be occupied by the enemy were increasingly depleted due to requisitioning of grain and conscription of soldiers. After the victory, it was possible to recuperate and first seek the recovery of the countryside, and then further work together to seek rural prosperity. Unexpectedly, the communist rebellion arose one after another. Where the flames of war reached, fields and houses were turned into ruins, creating the fragmented phenomenon of rural China today. Even the food supply has become a serious problem. "The people regard food as their heaven." The real crisis of the Chinese economy lies not in the decline of urban industry and commerce, but in the bankruptcy of the rural economy. It is truly admirable that foreign friends can pay attention to our country's rural areas and assist us economically in rural reconstruction. We must not miss this opportunity and ensure that these $27.5 million are used in the countryside to maximize their effectiveness.

All scholars who study rural China believe that if we want to save the crisis in rural China today, we must adopt a two-pronged approach of land reform and the application of scientific and technological knowledge. Ambassador Stuart's note also points out that the work of the China-United States Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, in addition to "consulting with the Chinese government on ways and means of gradually implementing various land reform measures," will also "select a number of counties in some provinces to create a coordinated and extensible plan for agriculture, family demonstration, health, and education. All aspects of agricultural production, sales, credit, irrigation, rural industry, nutrition, health, and education are included." From this, it can be seen that Sino-American cooperation in rebuilding our country's agriculture is precisely suited to the actual needs of rural China. However, on the occasion of the establishment of the Sino-American Joint Commission, we would like to offer a few suggestions for the reference of both China and the United States:

First, the rural situation in our country has never been prosperous, and reforms in the past have never had a significant effect. Today, with American economic assistance, we are working together to revitalize the countryside, which is truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. We can take advantage of this opportunity, make good use of American aid, and promote a policy of comprehensive rural construction. We believe that starting with the revitalization of the countryside may be the best way to save the Chinese economic crisis. We must pay special attention to this and make thorough plans and permanent arrangements.

Second, the United States' emphasis on rural reconstruction in China is a wise and insightful vision, but reforming Chinese agriculture must focus on improving production technology so that it can achieve the goal of increased production in the short term. Therefore, the funds required are huge, and certainly not something that a mere $27.5 million can solve. Since the United States is willing to assist China in rural reconstruction and fundamentally solve China's food shortage problem, it should expand the scope of assistance to achieve the task of rebuilding rural China.

### Zhejiang Province to Implement Land Reform; Basic Principles Confirmed; Starting with Protecting the Interests of Tenant Farmers

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 6th] The Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to promote moderate land reform under the principle of not harming the rights and interests of landlords. The specific measures are being considered and reviewed by Chairman Chen Yi. The basic principles are: (1) Thoroughly implement the "25% rent reduction" based on land lease registration to ensure the interests of tenant farmers. (2) Stipulate the maximum amount of land owned by individuals and organizations. Land exceeding the limit will be purchased by the government and resold to tenant farmers. (3) Land not owned by landlords or other wasteland, etc., may be purchased by the government and resold to tenant farmers if tenant farmers apply for purchase on their behalf or if the land is not used in accordance with government regulations. (4) The government will use a large amount of wasteland and seawalls to establish self-cultivating cooperative farms for poor farmers and tenant farmers to cultivate. As for tenant farmers purchasing property from the government, they can use installment payment methods. The government will use land bonds or other methods to raise funds for circulation. In short, starting with the "25% rent reduction" to protect the interests of tenant farmers, the goal of "land to the tiller" will be achieved through the most peaceful means, laying the foundation for the rural economy. After these measures are finalized, they will be implemented first in counties with excellent conditions and achievements in land registration.

The approved budget is 133.877 billion yuan. The Agricultural Extension Committee will be established soon, with an Extension Supervision Office under it.

### Limiting Private Farmland; Jiangxi Province Begins Preparations

Implementation awaits the provincial government's decision.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 6th] Jiangxi Province has begun preparations for limiting the area of privately owned farmland since last month. The official implementation date will await the final decision of the provincial government. Local people believe that this work is an important step in implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood and equalizing land ownership. According to highly reliable sources: The maximum limit for the area of privately owned farmland per person will be based on the following regulations: (1) The paddy field per household shall not exceed 50 mu of upper-grade, 75 mu of middle-grade, or 100 mu of lower-grade. (2) The dry land shall be double the amount of upper, middle, and lower-grade paddy fields. (3) Those who own both paddy and dry land (excluding workers) and have more than ten family members may increase the amount proportionally. From the date of promulgation of these measures, all those whose privately owned farmland exceeds the limit shall be required to sell the excess farmland within three years. If the deadline is exceeded, the municipal and county governments may request the provincial government to confiscate the land in accordance with the law and allocate it to self-cultivating farmers. The compensation land price for the confiscation may be accompanied by land bonds, which will be paid off in five years.

### Gansu Province has Too Many Prisoners; Exceeding Prison Capacity

### Merchants Transporting Money to Xiamen Return to Shanghai on the Same Plane; Civil Aviation Team Privately Flies to Xiamen; Violates Contract Regulations; China Aviation and other Airlines Protest to the Civil Aviation Bureau

[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 6th] Three merchants who privately transported money to Xiamen from Shanghai by special plane on the 4th in an attempt to buy black market foreign exchange returned to Shanghai on the same plane today. They came to Xiamen on the 4th with the money bundled into 48 pieces of luggage. The Xiamen Customs intended to detain them because more than 15 kilograms were carried by 28 people, but the Shanghai merchants argued that the plane had been inspected and released by the Jianghai Customs before taking off in Shanghai, and the Xiamen Customs had no reason to detain them. They argued at the Xiamen airport for five hours. Finally, the Xiamen Customs transported all the money to the Central Bank in the city for temporary storage. On the 5th, the merchants requested that 15 kilograms be returned to each person, and the remaining amount was also carried back to Shanghai by the same plane today and handed over to the General Office of the Customs Service for handling. It is reported that the special plane was contracted by a certain travel agency in Shanghai and resold to various merchants. The round-trip ticket price was 1 billion yuan per ticket. However, it is puzzling that the plane flew back to Shanghai after arriving in Xiamen from Shanghai on the 4th, and then flew from Shanghai to Xiamen this morning to carry the merchants back to Shanghai. All parties believe that this is a large-scale organized activity. As for the exact amount of money carried, it is not possible to know because the customs and the central bank have not sealed it, but it is estimated to be about 600 billion yuan.

[Report] Chennault's Civil Air Transport (CAT) plane was chartered to transport 600 billion yuan in cash to Xiamen from Shanghai by merchants. Upon arrival in Xiamen, the money was found and detained by customs. It is learned that the contract between CAT and the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) stipulates that the flight route does not include the Shanghai-Xiamen line. The fact that CAT has privately flown on this route clearly harms the business of regular airlines. It is heard that China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and other companies have formally protested to the CAA yesterday, requesting that it be stopped quickly.

### Prices Soar in Baoding and Jinan

On the 5th, ordinary flour exceeded 30 million yuan per bag, gold hit 700 million yuan, and Shanghai Coffee brand cigarettes were 10 million yuan per carton. Prices of various goods have doubled in the past two days, and the market is in chaos. The main reason is that the Ping-Bao highway has been interrupted for nearly a month, and there is still no hope of restoration. In addition, there are no flights from Ping-Bao, the surrounding area is tense, and the source of food and goods is cut off. The future still looks bullish. The local authorities have not yet taken measures to stabilize prices.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 6th] Prices in Jinan are rising madly. On the 6th, the first-class flour rose to 19.5 million yuan per bag, 20-count local yarn was 1.4 billion yuan per piece, and the black market price of gold broke 500 million yuan, reaching 500.2 million yuan per liang.

Hungry People in Various Parts of Hunan Province Repeatedly Involved in Disputes

[Special Dispatch from Changsha, 6th] Amidst the floods, disputes among hungry people have repeatedly occurred in various parts of Hunan Province. On the 29th of last month, in Chuanshan Township, Hengyang, disputes arose due to the distribution of accumulated grain and the announcement of low-interest loans.

### Three Special Envoys Revisit the Kremlin for Talks with Molotov Agreement Reached on Convening a Four-Power Conference Rumors of Soviet Demand for Co-Management of the Ruhr

[Our Dispatch] New York, 6th - Moscow Broadcast: The special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France went to the Kremlin at 5:00 PM today for talks with Molotov. Agreement has been reached on convening a four-power conference to discuss the German question.

[Our Dispatch] London, 6th - Broadcast: US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, French Ambassador to the Soviet Union 台岳, and Bevin's Secretary Roberts went to the Kremlin at 5:00 PM on the 6th to resume negotiations on the German question with senior Soviet officials. They hope to meet with Molotov. It is expected that the negotiations between the East and West blocs will end this weekend. The Western countries have held several meetings in Moscow and seem to have reached an agreement on the proposals to be submitted during the next visit to the Kremlin, but the details of the meeting are kept strictly secret and cannot be ascertained. It is reported that Stalin has requested to obtain speaking rights in the control of the Ruhr region as the price for lifting the Berlin blockade. After the Soviet Union participates in the control of the Ruhr region, it can obtain veto power over the policies of steel mills and other industrial productions, so as to contain the implementation of the US aid to Europe plan, so it is bound to be fought for.

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] According to well-informed diplomatic sources on the 5th, if the Western Allies can delay or cancel the West German National Assembly, which is scheduled to convene a constitutional assembly on September 1, the Soviet Union may lift the Berlin blockade. Stalin, in explaining his desire for peace, clearly stated that he was extremely unwilling to establish a West German government. Although Stalin did not state that he would lift the Berlin blockade if the Western Allies delayed the convening of the West German National Assembly, it is understood that the Western envoys have gained this impression and believe that this is a preliminary action that Stalin hopes the Western governments will take so that a better atmosphere can be reached between the four countries.

[Associated Press, London, 6th] Reliable sources report: The envoys of the United States, Britain, and France paid a visit to Stalin on the 2nd, opening a new prelude to East-West negotiations. Another Kremlin meeting is expected to take place within a few hours, but it may only be a conversation between the Western envoys and Molotov. The focus of the discussions at the negotiations between Western countries this week will be the location, time, and agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference (to discuss the German question). If the Kremlin and the West agree to reconvene the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, it is expected to be held in Paris this autumn, coinciding with the opening of the United Nations General Assembly on September 21, as the four powers will certainly be led by their foreign ministers to attend the delegation. This conference can be compared to the Foreign Ministers' Conference held in New York between 1946 and the 21st, as the UN General Assembly was also held at that time, and the draft treaties with the enemy satellite countries were also passed at that conference.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] According to British authoritative sources, the communiqué of the Western Three Powers' representatives' consultations with the Soviet government will be released within this week shortly after the Three Powers' representatives consult with Molotov again. The communiqué will also be announced simultaneously in Moscow, London, Washington, and Paris.

### Soviet Implies Concessions to Western Countries The Situation in Berlin Tends to Ease Return of Detained Barges and Agreement on Foreign Currency Circulation

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th, Associated Press] Today, the Soviet side made concessions to the Western countries in Berlin and the occupied border areas, which seems to be the first expression of conciliation since they tightened their pressure on the Western countries in Berlin. In addition to returning ten barges detained by the Western countries, the Soviet side also agreed that other currencies can also be freely circulated in Berlin. It is reported that this agreement was reached after a meeting between Berlin municipal financial officials and the German bank under the auspices of the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 5th] German civil authorities and the Western Allies have recently achieved a major victory, as the Soviet authorities have recently announced that they will temporarily unfreeze the deposits of Germans stored in banks in the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, thus allowing commercial institutions in the Western countries' occupied zones of Berlin to use this to repay debts. However, British and American economic experts have issued warnings not to attach too much importance to the Soviet Union's relaxation of restrictions. A British spokesman hinted that the Soviet Union's concessions may be related to the Moscow negotiations.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 6th] A French military spokesman here denied this morning the news released by the Soviet ADN news agency that most of the semi-official figures and officials in the French-occupied zone of Berlin have left Berlin.

### US House Passes Amended Bill to Curb Inflation

[US Information Service, Washington, 5th] The House of Representatives today passed a bill advocated by the Republican Party, the purpose of which is to prevent the threat of inflation in the United States by restricting consumer credit and bank credit, and increasing the gold reserves of banks in the Federal Reserve System. This measure is a substitute for President Truman's seven-point anti-inflation plan, and was passed by a vote of 264 to 97, and has now been submitted to the Senate for consideration. The Republican leaders in the Senate also hope to enact it quickly. The measures advocated by the Republican Party do not include the regulations on price rationing and wage controls requested by the government, which the President called an "ineffective compromise."

### New Witnesses Discovered in US Espionage Case The Truth of the Entire Case Can Be Revealed Truman Criticizes as a Republican Farce

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman on the 5th allowed the investigation of espionage cases, a low-taste farce by the Republican Party. However, the House Un-American Activities Committee said that this was not the case, and said that a mysterious new witness will soon "reveal" the entire case. Montrell, the acting chairman of the committee, said: He has appointed a special subcommittee, and the members of each subcommittee will leave Washington to an undisclosed city to question witnesses whose names have not been disclosed.

This person's name has never been mentioned in the investigation of communist cases, and it is only now that this person is known. This strange statement was issued after the committee held a closed-door meeting. According to Montrell, this mysterious witness was first announced by the committee's investigators at this closed-door meeting. "Our investigators believe that this person's testimony will lead to another witness, and the testimony of the two people will reveal the truth of the case." Hours before this statement was issued, Truman publicly ridiculed the case, saying; The investigating committees have not obtained any new evidence or new witnesses other than those submitted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the New York Federal Grand Jury. Truman accused the Republican Party of using the investigation of espionage cases to cover up the Republican Party's inability to take action on the anti-inflation plan. However, Montrell insisted that the committee had reason to believe that the Soviet spy organization was still working within the federal government. It is also learned that Time magazine editor Chambers swore that former State Department official Alger Hiss was a member of the communist underground spy organization. Hiss completely denied the allegations in the committee on the 5th.

### The Soviet Union Commands Asian Communists to Launch Decisive Offensive The Red Army Can Take Action Immediately When Necessary

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] US Congressman Zhou Yide read an article written by 璣波格 on the 5th and included it in the Congressional Record. The article warned that the Communist Party has launched a decisive offensive in Asia. The text was published in the "American World Report" bi-weekly magazine, stating: "In Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, Thailand, and the mainland of China, Moscow experts provide underground troops with various instructions in ideology, intelligence, counter-espionage, political strategy, economic sabotage, and military strategy, so that the Red Army can take immediate action once the white people withdraw from the awakened Asia."

Zhou Yizhu pointed out that the author of the article, Nau Pog, is "a very qualified and most informed person, and the news comes from across the Shanghai and around the world. In the past, this news has proven to be extraordinarily accurate." Nau氏 said in the article that the riots in Vietnam, Malaya, and Kashmir are all part of a major plan presided over by Moscow." Red Army strategists are also expanding their intelligence network in central and southern Asia on a monthly basis. The strength of the Soviet spy organization was most greatly expanded when the Soviet Union established a legation in Bangkok. The Soviet legation in Bangkok, under the strong leadership of Minister奈謙那, has 45 personnel, all of whom are outstanding special agents.

### Questions and Answers about the Berlin Incident

— Translated by Zhang Shi

The following questions and answers about the Berlin incident are translated from the "U.S. News & World Report" published on July 16, 1948. After reading this set of questions and answers, we can have a clearer understanding of the Berlin issue that is currently disturbing the whole world.

Q: Can the Soviet Union drive the British, American, and French out of Berlin?

A: Yes. The British, American, and French forces stationed in Berlin number only 6,500, while the Soviet troops stationed around Berlin currently total 300,000. Moreover, Berlin is a hundred miles away from West Germany, so if the situation becomes tense, the British, American, and French will not be able to stay for long. At the same time, in terms of strength, as long as the Soviet Union uses force, Berlin can easily fall into Soviet hands.

Q: Will the Berlin incident lead to war?

A: No, the Soviet Union does not want to control Berlin by force.

Q: How can the Soviet Union get Berlin without using force?

A: The Soviet Union wants to use the means of blockading land and water transportation between Berlin and West Germany to bring Berlin under its control. It believes that after cutting off Berlin's land and water transportation, it can make the British, American, and French feel the difficulty of supplying materials to the western district of Berlin and automatically withdraw from Berlin. Then the Soviet Union can independently decide Berlin's political affairs.

Q: What does the United States hold in Berlin?

A: Berlin was the capital of Germany in the era of its strength and unity, and it is a place to which the hearts of the people turn. Therefore, the Soviet Union wants to use this place as the seat of a communist government under Soviet control, so as to unify the whole of Germany in the future. When the British, American, and French are still in Berlin, this communist government cannot be established, so in order to complete this plan, the Soviet Union will naturally have to drive the forces of the British, American, and French three countries out of Berlin first.

Q: What agreements have the Soviet Union and the Western powers had regarding Berlin's transportation?

A: There is no formally established treaty regarding the Soviet Union's permission for the Western powers to transport supplies into Berlin. What the United States holds is a memorandum that President Truman sent to Stalin in mid-June 1945, mentioning that the United States could have the right to railway, highway, and air lines to Berlin, and Stalin did not object at that time. Although the Soviet Union does not formally regulate transportation, it has the ability to restrict passage to and from Berlin at any time, if it pleases to do so.

Q: Does the Soviet Union have the power to blockade Berlin's land and water transportation?

A: According to the United States, the Soviet Union has no right to blockade Berlin's land and water transportation. In the Soviet Union's view, apart from the provisions of written agreements, there are no other reasons. Because there is no written agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union has no right to blockade Berlin's land and water transportation, the Soviet Union believes that it has the power to blockade Berlin's land and water transportation.

Q: Where were the treaties regarding Berlin concluded?

A: There were no even simple treaties regarding Berlin supply controls. The basic treaty, however, was concluded in the European Advisory Commission in London, at that time in December 1943. In June 1945, at the Potsdam Conference held in Potsdam by Truman, Stalin, and Churchill, they all agreed that each occupying authority could have the right to exercise supreme power in its occupied zone. The result of this conference, however, turned Berlin into an island in the Soviet occupation zone.

Q: What is the matter with the air corridors?

A: There are three air corridors between West Germany and Berlin, each 20 miles wide. One is from the British occupation zone to Berlin, one is from the American occupation zone to Berlin, and the other is from the French occupation zone to Berlin. The matter of the air corridors was stipulated in a treaty in 1945. British, American, and French aircraft can freely fly back and forth in the corridors, and do not need to notify the Soviet army. However, Soviet aircraft also have the right to fly back and forth in the air corridors of various countries.

Q: Are Berlin's needs entirely supplied by the Western powers?

A: No. The Soviet occupation zone has a population of 1.7 million, whose needs are supplied by the Soviet side. The British, American, and French occupation zones have a total population of 2 million, whose needs are supplied by the British, American, and French countries.

Q: Can the British, American, and French solve the supply of materials to West Berlin by airlift?

A: In the short term, it is possible. The current consumption of materials in West Berlin is 6,000 tons per day, including 2,000 tons of food and 2,000 tons of coal. However, the airlift volume of the British, American, and French is only 2,000 tons per day, which is equivalent to the food consumption of West Berlin in every 24 hours. Because the airlift volume is so small, the materials currently transported to Berlin by the British, American, and French three countries are all coal and other more important supplies. (Above)

### Jewish People Willing to Hold Peace Conference with Arab League Invitation Card Already Requested to be Forwarded by Bernadotte

[United Press International, Tel Aviv, 5th] Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok requested Bernadotte on the 5th to contact the Arabs to hold a peace conference.

Mr. Shertok stated that the Israeli government is considering participating in a roundtable conference and trying to reach an agreement with the Arabs.

### Attending the Temporary Meeting of the Public Utilities Group Senators Criticize New Prices for Public Utilities The Four Opinions Await Further Discussion Today

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee held a continuous meeting for four hours starting at 3:00 PM yesterday to review the excessively large price increases for various public utilities in August, as suggested by Fei Shusheng and 70 others. Please convene a temporary meeting to discuss how to reduce the price increases to ease the burden on the citizens. Speaker Pan attended, as did Deputy Speaker Xu, and more than 60 senators. Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, Deputy Director Zhang, and others were also present. Conveners Jiang Hao and Xu Xueyu served as the presidium. During the four hours, the senators spoke enthusiastically despite the heat, criticizing the new prices. Finally, it was decided that the review opinions were as follows:

(1) Convene a temporary meeting, the date of which will be decided by the speaker.

(2) Organize a research group, based on the opinions provided by the senators, to propose concrete opinions. In addition to all members of the Public Utilities Group, senators are invited to participate freely.

(3) Before a concrete plan is decided, please ask the municipal government to inform the companies to temporarily postpone charging the new prices.

(4) Transportation should stop charging the new prices, and the Public Utilities Bureau should temporarily determine the prices to be charged.

Whether the above items 3 and 4 should be communicated to the municipal government by letter, or whether they should be communicated to the municipal government after being resolved at a temporary meeting, should be submitted to the speaker for approval.

The secretariat of the committee immediately requested instructions from the speaker regarding this review opinion. After Speaker Pan approved it, the review opinions in items 3 and 4 above should also be submitted to the municipal government for handling after being passed by a regularly convened temporary meeting. Therefore, before being discussed by a temporary meeting, items 3 and 4 cannot take effect at this time.

### Mayor Wu Explains The Three Principles of Handling

At the beginning of yesterday's meeting, Mayor Wu first reported on the process of approving the new prices. He stated that the municipal government will never protect public utilities, and has always been seeking a reasonable price that takes into account both the burden on citizens and the continued maintenance of the companies' operations. He personally believes that the handling of the current price issues of public utilities cannot escape three principles: (1) Allow oil and coal to be settled in foreign exchange one month in advance, and have the national bank advance funds. (2) Adopt socialist pricing, with lighter burdens for those who consume less and heavier burdens for those who consume more. (3) The five gold and livelihood indexes of public utilities are allowed to calculate the new prices for this month based on the previous month plus 50%. The municipal government has indeed made its best efforts to handle the prices of public utilities, but it still hopes that the senators will have better suggestions.

Director Zhao then reported on the reasons for the sharp rise in new prices, one of which was that the foreign exchange policy was changed to use foreign exchange settlement certificates, and the second was that the companies' users often delayed paying fees, which affected the companies' capital turnover.

### Senators Speak Up

Then Shao Yongsheng, the representative of the 70 original proposers, delivered a speech, stating that the senators did not mean to say that the municipal government was a cheerleader for public utilities, but that when citizens were unable to afford the new prices, resulting in the cutting off of water and electricity, and the number of people affected gradually increased to 40% to 50% of the total number of citizens in the city, would the central government still turn a blind eye and deaf ear? Therefore, a temporary meeting should be convened immediately to make a heartfelt statement to the central government, urging the central government to pay attention. This matter is no longer of a local nature and effective measures should be taken quickly.

Fei Shusheng believed that the municipal government should bear considerable responsibility for this new price increase. He listed seven points that should be corrected and urged the authorities to supervise and urge the companies to improve as soon as possible.

After that, Yan Esheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhou Xiangsheng, Yu Shun, Chen Peide, Shui Xiangyun, Yang Wusheng, Jiang Haisu, etc. expressed their opinions one after another. The important opinions can be summarized as follows: (1) Foreign businessmen operating industrial and mining enterprises in China have no reason to use US dollars as the standard for calculating certain treaty items. (2) In the future, when adjusting prices, it may be possible to follow the motion of the Nanjing Municipal Council and use 80% of the pre-war price as the base, and then adjust according to the monthly cost of living index. (3) Socialist pricing is also sufficient to affect large industrial and commercial users, eventually leading to the serious consequences of industrial and commercial bankruptcies. (4) Whether various surcharges can be reduced. (5) The unreliability of the calculation base of the automatic adjustment formula.

### The Speaker Expresses His Opinion The Convening of a Temporary Meeting Should Be Considered in Advance

Then Speaker Pan also expressed his opinion, stating that the adjustment of new prices for public utilities still lies in whether the central government is responsible, because: (1) Before the central government has finalized the entire economic, financial, and fiscal policy (especially the monetary issue), the price issue of public utilities will inevitably become more and more intense. (2) The municipal government and the senators have long known that the issue of repeated adjustments in the prices of public utilities would come. In March, they made suggestions to the central government, but they were unfortunately shelved. Fortunately, some wise officials ran around to negotiate loans, otherwise, the price increase would have been even greater. The council had regular meetings in March and June, and made many suggestions to the central government, but the central government often gave official answers, and the council's credibility had already been discounted. Therefore, if a temporary meeting is to be convened this time, it should be carefully researched and considered in advance. His personal opinion is that in the future, the adjustment of prices for public utilities should be based on the average of the foreign exchange rate increase and the cost of living index to find a proper standard. In addition, the bad debts owed by agencies and troops should be paid off immediately to reduce the burden on citizens.

Finally, Mayor Wu proposed three points: (1) The 50% import tariff on various imported materials for public utilities should be exempted or reduced. (2) Foreign exchange for oil and coal should be settled one to three months in advance at a time. (3) It is hoped that the accessories related to various public utilities in US aid can be supplied.

The Public Utilities Committee meeting is scheduled to convene a meeting at the committee again at 3:00 PM today to continue discussing the four review opinions. The council secretariat has already issued an urgent notice yesterday.

### Ten Cases Involving Suspected Hoarding of Materials in Warehouses Separately Agreed Upon Methods of Handling Five Units Approved for Relocation After Proof

[Report from this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau previously held inspections of 32 warehouses that had exceeded the time limit for reporting in the upper month, in order to suppress prices and crack down on hoarding.

According to the company's statement, the goods are native paper, not rough-edged. After discussion, it was considered that the reasons were insufficient, and the inspection team will investigate again before making a decision. (2) Jianzhong Company's 20 tons of white coal stored in Litai Warehouse. The reasons stated by the company are insufficient and will be decided after further investigation. (3) Xinzhong Newspaper's 50 rolls of newsprint stored in Rongxing Warehouse. According to the newspaper, the Ministry of the Interior has approved the registration and will be published soon. After investigation, it is true and will be allowed to be relocated. (4) Tang Junyuan of Changsheng Company's cotton and fine cloth stored in the warehouse of China Business Company.

(5) Dasheng Yarn Factory's single and double-linked cloth stored in the warehouse of Jiangsu Provincial Bank. After proof by the Textile Export Management Committee, it is indeed for export and will be allowed to be relocated. (6) Silk Industry Bank's cloth stored in Shunheng Warehouse.

According to a letter from the Chongming Cotton Yarn and Native Cloth Trade Association, it is not being sold at present due to the unsuitable season and will be allowed to be relocated. (8) Tianjin Railway Bureau's 1,000 bags of flour stored in Shunheng Warehouse. According to a letter from the bureau, it is for the bureau's colleagues to use themselves and will be allowed to be relocated, but the bureau will be informed that if it stores flour in the future, it should be registered according to law. (9) Hongcheng Coal Company's 89 tons of Datong coal stored in Hengde Warehouse. According to a letter, the coal has been resold to Zhenye Coal Company, and it has been decided to order the inspection team to re-examine and verify.

In addition, there is another case of hoarding involving the Continental Bank, which is highly suspected and will be investigated again.

As for the remaining 300-odd warehouses that have already been reported, the inspections cannot be started until the inspection forms have been printed next week.

### Guan Shanyue's Works Will Be Exhibited in Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] Guan Shanyue, a famous painter from Lingnan, studied under Gao Jianfu in his early years, and has devoted himself to the national painting reform movement for more than ten years, and his reputation is well-known at home and abroad. In 1938, he participated in the Soviet Chinese Art Exhibition with works such as "The Calamity of Fishermen", "What I Saw on Sanzao Island", and "Fishing Doll". During the Anti-Japanese War, he secretly crossed the border from Hong Kong and returned to China. His footprints have traveled all over the southwest and northwest, and the scenery of the border area and the fortress has been included in his sketch collection, which is extremely valuable. The Ministry of Education once selected one of his "The First Continuous Pasture" to participate in the United Nations Education Exhibition held in Paris two years ago. Last summer, Guan also brought the work to overseas exhibitions to increase the overseas Chinese's understanding of the motherland and contributed greatly. Guan has recently published two collections of sketches from the Northwest and South Seas in Shanghai, and is scheduled to exhibit nearly 200 recent works at the Daxin Company Art Gallery from August 9 to 14, including Southwest, Northwest, Puyang, Dunhuang, and historical anti-Japanese war paintings.

### The Ministry of Justice Reiterates Previous Order Strictly Prohibiting Abuse of Criminal Defendant Detention; Future Promotion, Transfer, and Performance Evaluation to be Based on Strict Compliance

[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Justice, noting that local courts are abusing the detention of criminal defendants, which violates the original intent of the law, has specifically reiterated its previous order and circulated a strict prohibition. The judicial organs in this city have recently received this instruction, which states: "It has been found that due to limited funding, not all detention centers in various provinces have been fully constructed. Most of the existing buildings are dilapidated and cramped, and some sites were destroyed during the war and have not been repaired after the war. Criminal defendants are still being held in prisons. During this summer season, detention houses are crowded, which not only harms health but also makes them susceptible to disease. Moreover, the national treasury is depleted, and food prices are high. The government bears a huge burden for prisoner food, and providing assistance is particularly difficult. Unless measures are taken to alleviate this situation, it will be difficult to reduce the current difficulties. Whether a criminal defendant is guilty has not yet been decided. According to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, detention is not allowed unless one of the situations listed in Article 76 applies. The original intent of the legislation was to make non-detention the principle. Therefore, the Ministry has repeatedly issued orders to strictly prohibit the abuse of criminal defendant detention. According to the investigation forms submitted by various detention centers regarding the detention and investigation of defendants, the number of detainees is still very high, even more than double the number of convicted prisoners. This shows that personnel at all levels have not earnestly followed the original intent of the legislation. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated. The chief of each court must supervise their subordinates to strictly comply with the repeated announcements, strictly prohibit abuse of detention, expedite the investigation and trial of all pending cases, and clear up backlog cases. Newly received cases should also be handled promptly and not be detained casually. In the future, the promotion, transfer, and performance evaluation of prosecutors at all levels will be based on whether their handling of cases is appropriate and timely and whether there is any abuse of defendant detention. Each should be especially cautious and not be negligent in the slightest."

### Lawyer Ji Chao Wanted for a Case Ministry of Justice Orders Suspension of Legal Practice Lawyer Ji Denies Ever Committing a Crime

[Our Newspaper] Lawyer Ji Chao was previously wanted for a case, and the warrant has not yet been revoked. Recently, the Ministry of Justice has ordered the city's courts and the Shanghai Bar Association to comply with the order to suspend Ji's legal practice and revoke his registration due to the outstanding warrant.

The person in charge of the District Court said yesterday: Regarding the Ministry of Justice's order that lawyer Ji Chao be suspended from practicing law due to a wanted warrant, he is currently unable to specify the case in which Ji Chao committed the crime and will only be able to clarify it after investigating the case. Another famous lawyer in the city said about this incident: If lawyer Ji was indeed wanted for a case, it is possible that when the warrant was issued, Ji's name was listed in a large batch of wanted lists, and the general public did not know that he was a lawyer. After a long time, the court and the bar association were not aware that he was on the wanted list. Now the Ministry of Justice is re-issuing the previous order to draw public attention. This reporter also asked lawyer Ji by telephone last night whether he had been wanted for a case in the court in the past, and why the Ministry of Justice revoked his lawyer qualification? Lawyer Ji replied: He has never committed a crime in the past and does not know why there is suddenly talk of a wanted warrant. However, he also heard friends mention this matter in the High Court. According to what he knows, the Ministry's order has not yet arrived. Before the Ministry's order arrives, he is unwilling to speculate or defend himself regarding the truth of the matter.

### Tooth Marks Appear on Chest and Arms Secrets Revealed Two Women in Court for Lawsuit

Chen Zhenxing, who once served as the manager of Ruili Company in this city, married Mei Ying in 1926 and lived together at 15, Lane 740, Fanhangdu Road, and had two sons and two daughters. Both sons have graduated from university. Chen's private life seemed quite serious, leaving early and returning late. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 28th of last month, Chen's Western-style shirt was suddenly torn, and female tooth bite marks were found on his left arm and chest. His wife, Mei Ying, was shocked to see this and discussed asking for compensation. Chen then confessed that he had a mistress, Lu Zhongying, who lived in Yongkang Lane, North Suzhou Road, for seven years. Recently, because Lu's demand for money was not met, they repeatedly argued and even beat each other. After hearing this, Mei Ying believed that Lu must have known that her husband had a spouse but still continued to commit adultery with him, which clearly constituted a crime of harming marriage, so she filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office. After receiving the complaint, Lu was also unwilling to show weakness and filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office accusing Chen Zhenxing of causing injury. Both cases were combined for investigation by the prosecutor yesterday. Because Chen did not arrive, the court ordered the case to be rescheduled for another hearing.

### Investigation of Wang Zhebin's Trafficking Case The Beijing Police Bureau Replied to the District Court Xu Songjiu Cannot Be Found

Regarding the drug trafficking case of Wang Zhebin, a legislator nominated and elected by the China Democratic Socialist Party, after the District Court accepted the case, it sent a letter to the Beijing Police Bureau requesting an investigation. The Beijing Police Bureau replied to the District Court yesterday, reporting the results of the investigation.

Moreover, Liu Wu, the wife of co-defendant Liu Runge, stated that Liu went to Nanjing in January and claimed to be unaware of Liu's alleged drug trafficking.

### Blind Man Dies Under Vehicle Driver Sentenced but Objects

[Our Newspaper] Jiang Weibang, the driver of an English-owned tram on Route 1, was driving west to east along Beijing West Road at 9:50 AM on July 3. When he arrived at the Jiangning Road intersection, he accelerated to pass, fearing obstruction by the red light. At that moment, Lou Zirong was crossing the road from north to south. The driver was unable to brake in time, causing Lou Zirong to be knocked down and suffer severe head injuries. He was sent to the hospital by police car but eventually died. Jiang Weibang was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, which immediately filed a public prosecution for causing death by negligence. Judge Fang Xianghai of the District Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon. Chen Lou, the daughter of the victim Lou Zirong, requested that the defendant be sentenced and filed an incidental civil suit. The defendant argued that the deceased Lou Zirong was blind and was killed when he walked into the tram, not run over in front of it, so it was clearly not his fault. Witness Pang Youchang, a passenger, testified that when the deceased ran into the tram, someone behind him shouted, "Uncle, the tram is coming! The victim did not hear and still squeezed onto the tram." The defendant's lawyer argued that the points raised by the prosecutor in the public prosecution were untenable; the 100 million yuan paid by the English-owned tram company was a condolence payment to the victim, not compensation for negligence. After the debate ended, Judge Fang announced the verdict in court: Jiang Weibang was sentenced to six months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence for causing death by negligence in the course of his business. The plaintiff expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and will file an appeal.

### Development of Xin'an River
### Prospects for Hydropower Engineering
The Xin'an River originates from the counties of Xiuning, She, Yi, Qi, Wu, and Jixi. At Meihua Beach in Jiekou Town of She County, it possesses abundant water resources with a large volume and rapid flow. The drop is very high. It is a unique hydropower resource in southeastern China. The farmland along the river reaches more than 8 million mu, with abundant products. Downstream, it converges with the Yan River, Tong River, and Qiantang River in Zhejiang. If we utilize the natural terrain of Jiekou to design a dam for power generation, it will enable the counties in southern Anhui to fully utilize their land, make the best use of their resources, facilitate the flow of goods, and boost agriculture, commerce, industry, and mining. Internal and external transportation will be unimpeded, directly benefiting the people and indirectly benefiting the nation. According to experts' estimates for the entire hydropower project, the initial development of 80,000 kilowatts requires only US$2.8 million. It is sincerely hoped that our government will consult with the United States Economic Cooperation Administration to send specialized technical personnel to conduct further surveys. Fund allocation should be made under the US aid program to quickly advance the project. If US aid funds are difficult to allocate quickly, the estimated amount, converted into rice, is only 2 million shi. With the financial resources of various places in southeastern China, it will not be difficult to raise funds separately, making the burden light. Using local financial resources to build dams for power generation brings permanent and boundless benefits with a temporary and limited burden. Why not do it! Moreover, the entire project is expected to be completed in two years, requiring a short time and yielding immediate results, unlike waiting for the Yellow River to clear. Now, let's briefly discuss the expected benefits after power generation:

### Industry and Mining
China's industrial and mining enterprises have suffered a lot of damage in recent years due to war. In areas where transportation is blocked, even if there are mineral deposits, it is difficult to exploit them. Southern Anhui has always been rich in mineral deposits. Such as the iron in Fanchang and Dangtu, the copper in Tongling and Tongguanshan, the antimony in Xiuning, the gold in Jixi, and the coal in Xuanning, which are the most prominent. With hydropower facilities, it will be easier to develop the above-mentioned mineral deposits. In the future, the white coal in southern Anhui and the black coal in Huainan will compete side by side and be used for the country, which is the most beneficial thing. Without hydropower generation, mining is not easy and refining is even more difficult. Goods are abandoned in the ground, and people suffer from poverty. If the cotton in Guichi and Dongliu, the ramie silk in Qingyang, and the bamboo and wood in Huizhou, all the raw materials that can be used for the fiber industry, as well as the processing of various agricultural products, cannot be prospered without hydropower.

### Agriculture
Southern Anhui is a land of fish and rice. The mountainous areas are also places where mountain farmers live and thrive. If we want to increase production and eliminate worries about floods and droughts, we can only rely on hydropower generation. It can provide resources for flood control in times of flooding, and irrigation in times of drought. Negatively, it can eliminate disasters. We can also use electricity to produce agricultural fertilizers, actively increasing resources. And it can make the benefits of electrification available to remote rural areas. Life is prosperous, healthy, wealthy, and both national economy and people's livelihood are reliable.

### Transportation
Xin'an River is the mainstream connecting Anhui and Zhejiang, but unfortunately, the beaches and shoals are continuous, making navigation difficult. The danger of downstream navigation is equal to the Three Gorges. Upstream travel relies entirely on human traction, which is difficult and slow, exceeding expectations. As the saying goes: "One beach is ten feet high, Xin'an is in the sky." So it's no wonder. Now, if we use hydropower at Jiekou in Xin'an River, the water volume will be deepened and the river channel will be flattened. It is possible to navigate electric boats, making water transportation completely change its old appearance. On the land side, not only can all the highways in southern Anhui be converted to electric vehicles, but also the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway can use this hydropower. (It seems less than a quarter of thermal power) I read in the newspaper that people in Zhejiang Province are now working hard on the Qiantang River hydropower project. It is hoped that they can choose sites in Lan River, Qu River, Yan River, and Tong River to carry out projects. Anhui Province focuses on creating facilities at Jiekou. Let Anhui and Zhejiang make the most of their hydropower, cooperate, and let Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhu all benefit from it. It is not only a temporary and local benefit, but also a benefit for all ages.

### Other Discussion
The above points are related to enriching the country and benefiting the people. I hope that the gentlemen of our country will rise up to support them together. And unanimously call on the government to complete the surveying of the Hui River. Actively prepare for implementation. As for the increased water level after the dam is built, the fields and houses along the Xin'an River may be the first to suffer. We should plan ahead and provide thorough relief. Make sure that those who suffer do not feel the pain of the disaster, and that those who are relocated are happy to receive more benefits. If everyone, like the old man who lost his horse, thinks that it will be beneficial and not harmful, it will depend on the motivation of the organizer and the relationship between the interests of the local people as the criterion. It cannot be completely said in one word. (Thank You)

### Creating Misery for Descendants by Leaving Thousands of Acres of Good Land
### Analyzing the Dispute Over Ancestral Property Between Cousins

Li Shizhong asks: There is a piece of ancestral vacant land in my hometown, owned by three branches of the family. In the spring of the 33rd year, the nephew and cousin-in-law (when the cousin was in the mainland) colluded to sell two-fifths of it. When I heard about it, I was unable to stop it. I had no choice but to make an agreement with the cousin-in-law for the remaining part, each managing it separately. I notified my cousin before and after, and he did not object. Who knew that my cousin returned to Shanghai last year and reversed the agreement, agreeing with me to sign a "Return of Courtyard Agreement" (a corner under my name), agreeing to pay 15 shi of white rice as the price. Several months have passed since the agreement was signed, but it has not been fulfilled. I would like to ask: (1) Is the separation agreement established during the enemy-puppet period valid? (Although the cousin was not present, the clan chief and two witnesses participated and signed the agreement). (2) Is the voucher obtained by deceiving me this spring valid? Only the clan chief signed and I signed, and no witnesses were present. (3) What means should be used to deal with it if my cousin infringes on the land boundary in the future?

[Answer from Mr. An Mingshi] (1) According to Article 1021 of the Civil Code, a wife can dispose of joint property within the scope of agency power stipulated in Article 1003. And Article 1003 of the Civil Code stipulates that husband and wife are mutual agents in daily household affairs. Furthermore, according to Article 1023 and Article 1024 of the Civil Code, the various debts stipulated therein shall either be the responsibility of the husband or be the responsibility of paying off all of his property. Therefore, whether the separation agreement established in the 23rd year mentioned in this case is valid depends entirely on whether the agency power at the time of disposition meets the above regulations. (2) The so-called fraud should be subject to the burden of proof. (3) The so-called encroachment on the land boundary, this land boundary should first be proven to be owned by the infringed person. Therefore, confirming ownership and clearly delineating the boundaries can determine whether there is infringement. Self-governing institutions such as district offices are familiar with the local situation and can mediate the facts; however, trials should be handled by the court.

### National Banks Expand Interbank Teller Quotas
### Currency Shortage Still Not Resolved
### Financial Control Bureau to Crack Down on Banks' and Firms' Indiscriminate Issuance of Promissory Notes
[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has requested the restoration of the use of bills as collateral. According to Lin Chongyong, Director of the Financial Control Bureau: this matter needs to be carefully studied, but after the implementation of the ban on collateral, there are indeed drawbacks that need to be improved.

In addition, the Financial Control Bureau is drafting measures to regulate national banks, and is actively inspecting commercial banks and firms. A working group was dispatched yesterday.

Currently, due to the severe currency shortage, small banks and firms are developing large numbers of promissory notes, forming a disguised form of credit expansion. The Financial Control Bureau is paying close attention to this and will take measures to crack down on it.

Furthermore, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Financial Control Bureau, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. According to Lin, he was personally instructed by President Weng in Beijing to strengthen financial control in Shanghai. The measures to strengthen control will be incorporated into the soon-to-be-completed economic reform plan and announced for implementation. As for reducing banking units to enhance the strength of the financial industry, it is said that there is no rigid requirement to reduce the number of 6,000 to 2,000. Effective adjustments will be made in accordance with the time and place.

[Commodity Survey Institute News] The long-standing cash shortage situation slightly improved yesterday. The Central Bank increased the withdrawal quota for interbank, with the maximum changed to 120 billion yuan. The market premium continued to be small, about 5%. However, the demand for 1 million yuan bills is still very high, and the premium rate remains at 10%. According to sources from the Central Bank: the bank's daily issuance of banknotes in Shanghai is currently increased to 3 to 5 trillion yuan per day. The Shanghai Central Printing Factory can print 20 to 30 trillion yuan per day, but it must supply the provinces of Central and South China, so the issuance in this city cannot fully meet the demand.

The price of old car flour was 14.9 million yuan, and the price of battleship flour also rose to 14.6 million yuan under the absorption of Beibang. The former rose by 1.15 million yuan, and the latter rose by 1.35 million yuan.

The price of miscellaneous grains has continued to rise. The loosening of credit has increased the buying momentum, so the market situation is very brisk. Moreover, because the cost of transportation has increased again, the sellers have held on firmly. The price of soybeans has risen by 2 million yuan. New corn has appeared on the market, with an opening price of 25 million yuan. The prices of other corn have increased by 1 million yuan. Yuanmai also rose by 2 million yuan.

### Qihong Market Trend is Firm

The Qimen black tea, which is mainly sold to the United Kingdom, has been steadily sold by the capitalists. However, due to the high prices, the buyers have been hesitant and the process has been quiet for a long time. However, the exchange settlement application has risen endlessly, resulting in exporters searching for good prices one after another, and the transaction has gradually become clear. Especially yesterday, in the mutual competition of Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and other foreign firms, the transaction volume doubled, and the market still showed its strength. The prices of other varieties all followed the trend.

### Cotton Yarn Replication Industry
### Preparing to Organize an Export Agency

In order to expand exports, the cotton yarn replication industry is preparing to organize an export company. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the dyeing and weaving industry association, has been discussing with other important replication industry leaders in recent days and has drafted measures and is actively proceeding. According to Pan yesterday, the previous export association's measures were inappropriate and caused a lot of harm. Similar industries have trademarks with a reputation abroad. Foreign countries often send telegrams to purchase, but because they are under control, they cannot directly export. After the export association transfers the goods, there are many losses. After gathering and discussing, industries believe that they should organize an export company to specialize in the sale of cotton yarn replicas, which can complement the export company organized by the yarn factory industry. The dyeing and weaving industry has united with other important replication industries, drafted measures, collected statistics, and sent himself and others to Beijing in the near future to meet with President Weng, Minister Chen, etc., to personally report on the current export situation of cotton yarn replicas and to actively organize export agencies in contact with all parties so that they can be established in a short period of time.

It was also revealed that the joint venture company previously formed by the replication industry was forced to suspend operations due to management methods. The new organization led by the dyeing and weaving industry this time is different from before.

### Yarn Prices Rise First and Then Fall
### Cotton Cloth Sales are Booming and Prices are Rising Sharply

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation was because credit was very loose, and the buying intentions of both local and out-of-town merchants were still strong. Due to the fact that the raw material cotton inventory of manufacturers was dwindling and the distribution of US-aided cotton was slow to relieve the urgent need, the offering intention was relaxed, and those who had goods took the opportunity to raise prices.

The initial price of 42-count blue phoenix fine yarn was immediately raised to 150 million, and the high price of 220 million was offered for tomorrow. Afterwards, due to the briskness of the cloth market, people's expectations were even stronger, and the prices of various yarns created new highs. Near the close, it was heard that the situation in the interior had slightly declined, and the price was finally closed at 220 million for immediate delivery and 224 million for delivery tomorrow, which was an increase of 145 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 50 to 60 million to 120 to 3 million yuan, and 66 pieces were traded.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was brisk because the hidden interest rate was low, credit was loose, and the trend turned active, and people's expectations were also strong. The Changjiang Gang and the Tianjin-Hankou-Changsha Gang competed to purchase and transport due to rising freight rates. Cloth merchants also thought that the northern sales would start soon and the market situation was promising. Dyeing factories held on to few offerings due to increased labor and material costs and public utility costs, and the market presented a situation of more demand than supply.

The initial market price of 12-pound dragon head fine cloth was immediately raised again by 2.8 million yuan. Subsequently, the floating was more active due to the fierce absorption by similar businesses, and the market price rose to 65 to 66 million yuan for transactions. It finally closed at 64.5 million yuan, which was an increase of 5.3 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other markets also generally increased by 10% to 15%, and 2,620 pieces were traded.

### New Cotton Production This Year
### May Reach 2 Million Dan
### Only Enough for One-Third of Demand

The new cotton planted in various places this year has now gradually matured and will begin to be harvested in mid-next month. The cotton authorities have ordered cotton growers in various places to pay attention to harvesting technology.

It is estimated that the new cotton in various places this year can produce a total of 3 million dan. Based on the domestic demand, this output is only one-third of the demand, and two-thirds still need to rely on foreign cotton imports.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Shanghai's Fourth Nine Factory and Maosheng Cotton Industry Company in Chongqing purchased more than a thousand bales of Shaanxi cotton, but they have not been released due to the strict implementation of orders by the Water Police Bureau.

### Foreign Currency Deposit Certificate Utilization Issue
### It is Heard That Two Principles Have Been Determined

Regarding the issue of the issuance and utilization of special foreign currency deposit certificates, people in the wool textile industry and the import and export industry in this city have recently repeatedly requested the Central Bank to issue them quickly and allow them to be utilized. However, so far, there are no concrete results. According to a semi-official source, the authorities are studying the matter in detail in recent days. It is heard that in addition to materials compulsorily purchased, foreign currency deposit certificates will still be issued and allowed to be utilized. For the parts purchased and resold by China Trust, it may be converted into legal currency. It is said that although the export situation has slightly improved in the past few days, the number is still very limited, and the expenditures are extremely large. It is uncertain whether there are sufficient foreign exchange positions to pay when the deposit certificates expire.

The third is the payment of huge military and political funds.

### The Price of Foreign Exchange Certificates is Gradually Rising
### Overseas Remittances May Be Directly Remitted to Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th Dispatch] (1) It is learned that due to the continuous rise in the price of foreign exchange certificates, according to the current situation, it is more beneficial to directly remit overseas remittances to Guangzhou than to remit them to Hong Kong. According to the person in charge of the Guangzhou Branch of the Bank of China, it can earn at least 20% more than the black market, because each US dollar draft is worth 5.2 Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong. And each US dollar draft of the bank is worth 400,400 yuan in national currency according to the listed price, plus the bank's foreign exchange certificate price of 5.13 million yuan per US dollar, and each US dollar draft is worth a total of 5,534,000 yuan in national currency. Currently, each Hong Kong dollar is worth 880,000 yuan in national currency, and 5,534,000 yuan can be worth more than 6.28 Hong Kong dollars, that is, if overseas remittances are officially remitted back by the national bank, each US dollar can get more than 6.28 Hong Kong dollars, and if remitted to Hong Kong through illegal channels, it can get 5.2 Hong Kong dollars. The person in charge also said that if this situation can be maintained for a month, all overseas remittance problems can be easily solved.

### Macau Miss Aircraft Incident: Inside Story of the Mid-Air Robbery

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng of This Newspaper

[Canton Dispatch, Second Day] The "Macau Miss" passenger plane plying the Hong Kong-Macau route "crashed" into the sea off Macau on July 16th. The pilot and 27 passengers were on board. Except for passenger Huang Yuan (also known as Huang Yao), who was rescued, all 26 others perished. This news had already been published in this newspaper through telegrams and air dispatches. However, at the time, everyone thought it was just a regular plane crash and did not suspect any other secrets. Later, because the sole survivor, passenger Huang Yuan's, testimony was contradictory and his behavior suspicious, it aroused the attention of the Macau police authorities. At the same time, the general public also felt that the weather was very good that day, and the "Macau Miss" was an amphibious aircraft with variable engines. The incident occurred only a few minutes after takeoff, so even if the engine malfunctioned, it could descend for repairs without sinking into the sea. Therefore, everyone felt that the cause of the accident was bizarre and suspected that it might be a mid-air robbery. Bao Li, the head of the Macau Police Department, also sought clues from Huang Yuan and thoroughly examined the recovered aircraft wreckage and the bodies of the victims. After two weeks of effort, it has now been confirmed that this was an unprecedented major aircraft robbery. The surviving passenger Huang Yuan is one of the robbers. The whole process contains untold details, and the Macau authorities' breaking this tortuous major case in just two weeks can be described as a miracle in the history of detective work.

"Doumen People" Most Suspicious

Since the "Macau Miss" incident was suspected to be a mid-air robbery, the criminals were naturally among the passengers. Therefore, pursuing this lead naturally had to start with the passengers. The list and identities of the passengers that day were: (1) Huang Yuan (i.e., Huang Yao), (2) Zhao Chang, (3) Zhao Cai, (4) Zhao Yiming, (5) Lin Yun'ai (associated with He Yi Company), (6) Huo Songping (owner of Australia Xie Feng Company and Hong Kong Da San Yuan Restaurant), (7) Huang Zhida (nickname "Suffering Protection," a wealthy merchant from Shiqiao), (8) Wu Shouwen (General Manager of Coca-Cola South China), (9) Mrs. Wu Shouwen, (10) Li Yili (Manager of Guangzhou Real Estate Company), (11) Miss Huang (Li Yili's girlfriend), (12) Ms. Fang (wife of Hong Kong Professor Li Weilin), (The following are foreign passengers) (13) Shi Diaowei (Deputy Manager of Texaco Oil Company), (14) Mrs. Shi Diaowei, (15) He Zhiwen (Wholesale Director of Texaco Company), (16) to (19) Mr. and Mrs. Nelson and their two children, (20) Bi Liela (Portuguese merchant), (21) Mosigewei (Manager of an Indian Circus), (22) Mrs. Kanfuli (British), (23) Mrs. Shi Mieshi, and pilot Jia Lianma, assistant pilot Mai Tafu, Cathay Pacific Airways passenger service director Ke Shide, stewardess Da Gaoshida, etc., a total of twenty-seven people.

Looking at the list above, among the twelve Chinese passengers, the latter eight were merchants and businessmen who had actual residences and occupations in Hong Kong and Macau. Only four had no addresses in Hong Kong or Macau and were registered as "Doumen People" when purchasing tickets. Therefore, these four were naturally the most suspicious. Moreover, one night, the only rescued Huang Yuan was seen by the hospital guard secretly getting out of bed and attempting to walk (his leg was broken). Also, one night, he untied the bandages and attempted suicide, but was stopped by the guard. He also asked someone to bring a message to his family and instructed the messenger to keep the address strictly confidential. These secretive actions aroused the attention of the police, so they confined him to a separate room, prohibited him from talking to outsiders, and rigorously interrogated him while investigating the background of the other three.

The Origins of the Four Robbers Clarified

After several days of investigation, the police have learned the backgrounds of the four:

Huang Yuan—From Doumen, Zhongshan. During the Japanese puppet era, he served as the captain of the puppet guards in Tanzhou Township, Zhongshan. He had committed crimes in Macau.

Zhao Chang—From Doumen, Zhongshan. He was the "chief strategist" among the four robbers.

Zhao Cai—Also known as Zhao Sancai, from Chikan. He was originally a farmer but later associated with hooligans.

Zhao Yiming—Once served as a pilot and studied aviation in Manila. He was one of the oldest of the four robbers.

In addition, a part of the recovered aircraft wreckage was examined by experts, who determined that the aircraft was not on fire at the time and had no signs of a strong explosion. A bullet hole was found on the recovered wing, and one of the recovered bodies of passengers had a bullet wound, proving that the bullet entered from the chest and exited from the back. The body of assistant pilot Mai Tafu also had four and a half millimeter bullet wounds below the neck and on the back. At the same time, a .38 caliber revolver cartridge case was also recovered.

Therefore, based on the backgrounds of these four people, plus this kind of material evidence, the shocking mid-air robbery was confirmed. Moreover, the robber Huang Yuan could no longer deny it. He had no choice but to confess the truth and reveal their conspiracy to commit the robbery.

The Robbery Plan Prepared in Advance

Originally, their robbery was a planned conspiracy. They began preparing half a month in advance. Huang Yuan had spent three thousand Hong Kong dollars to carry out the matter. They took the plane back and forth between Hong Kong and Macau several times to understand the internal structure of the aircraft. They planned to take control of the aircraft, then have Zhao Yiming fly it to a predetermined location where four fishing boats were scheduled to receive the stolen goods. After the robbery, the passengers would be kidnapped for ransom. The distribution plan had also been drafted: the four robbers who boarded the plane would each receive one share, while the four fishing boats would share one share. On July 16th, they changed into suits and bought four tickets together, numbers 15, 16, 17, and 18, to board the plane as passengers.

Boarding the Plane, Occupying Four Positions

The four robbers occupied four positions. Zhao Cai was in the first position, close to the pilot and co-pilot's seats. Zhao Chang and Zhao Yiming stood in the first and third positions, monitoring the passengers on both sides and searching them. Huang Yuan stood at the main entrance to command everything.

At the beginning of the takeoff, Zhao Cai used a gun to threaten the pilot and co-pilot. The pilot and co-pilot were sitting on the left and right sides of the cockpit. After being threatened, they dared not move. It was learned that Shi Diaowei, the deputy manager of Texaco Company among the passengers, was a burly and powerful man. Seeing this, he knew that he was being robbed, so he rose to attack Zhao Cai. Unexpectedly, Zhao Yiming was right behind him and also pointed a gun at him. But Shi Diaowei did not submit. The two men then engaged in a dispute. The other passengers fled in panic, and the fuselage swayed from side to side. In the chaos, the pilot Jia Lianma secretly grabbed an iron bar and planned to turn around and strike Zhao Cai. Zhao immediately fired eight shots at Jia. Jia was immediately shot down. The plane immediately lost control and plunged downwards. The co-pilot was also unable to save it and crashed directly into the sea. At that time, Huang Yuan, who was standing at the entrance, saw that the situation was not good and hurriedly grabbed two seat cushions and jumped into the sea. The other twenty-six people unfortunately fell into the sea with the plane and died tragically. Later, Huang Yuan, the only survivor, became the key for the police to solve the case.

Conflicting Rumors About the Target of the Robbery

As for the target of their robbery, there are currently many conflicting rumors. Some say that they attempted to kidnap the wealthy merchants Huang Songping and Huang Zhida. However, it was later found that the two Huangs purchased their tickets after the four robbers, so this theory does not seem credible. The passenger carrying the most cash that day was Li Yili. According to his family, he had about four thousand US dollars. However, whether he was the main target of the robbery has not yet been confirmed by the police.

Now, this mid-air robbery case has finally come to an end. Of the four perpetrators, other than Huang Yuan, the other three have died. The police are now hunting down the other criminals involved in receiving the aircraft. Hong Kong Civil Aviation Director Si and the manager of Cathay Pacific Airways, Di Gengsu, along with two mechanical engineers, have traveled from Hong Kong to Macau to jointly study the case further with the police. After the surviving criminal Huang Yuan is handed over to the judiciary for trial, the whole case will be revealed.

[Xinxiang Dispatch, Fifth Day] Former Xinxiang County Magistrate Li Kuiguang was investigated by the Twelfth Pacification Zone for providing military funds to bandits. The results have proven that he conspired with Zhang Guozhen. Li Kuiguang repeatedly denied the charges during the trial, but after the court presented sufficient evidence and witnesses, he was unable to refute. A responsible person from the Pacification Zone informed reporters that the Pacification Zone's handling of the case has come to an end. Li Kuiguang is guilty of two major crimes: providing funds to bandits and murder. Currently, due to his identity and the importance of the case, he has been transferred to the Special Criminal Court of the Henan Provincial Government for legal judgment. The group of criminals was escorted to Kaifeng the day before yesterday.
