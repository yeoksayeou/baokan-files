### No More Currency Inflation; Xu Kan and Yu Hongjun Expressed Views; The Senate Standing Committee Decides to Offer Opinions on the General Budget

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The national general budget for the first half of the 37th year totals more than 9.6 billion yuan. When it was first drafted by the Ministry of Finance, this was the total amount of expenditures, while revenues only accounted for 61.2%. After review by the Special Review Committee of the State Council, it was considered that revenue and expenditure must be balanced. Since it is not easy to reduce expenditures, efforts should be made to increase revenue. The 38.8% shortfall should be made up for with other taxes. The first is the 30 trillion yuan special relief donation, and the second is tax reform, using the income from prepaid taxes to make up for it. Xu Kan, Director of Budget, and Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance, stated regarding this year's budget that there will be no currency to make up for it this year, that is, there will be no further currency inflation, and efforts will be made to prevent it from being added to again.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The review meeting of the Standing Committee of the Senate on the draft national general budget for the first half of the 37th year continued to be held at noon on the 14th. After the senators expressed their opinions separately, it was decided to ask Wu Zhaoxu and Fan Yuzhi to draft review opinions, which would be submitted to the secretariat for revision and then submitted to the National Government for reference. According to Wu's report to reporters: Their opinions can be roughly concentrated on the following principles, and their review opinion letter will be drafted based on these principles: (A) Appropriate control should be exercised over expenditures to ensure that the amount of expenditures does not deviate further and further from the budget. (B) The revenue part, where those already included in the budget, must not be left empty, that is, those that have been clearly identified as revenue must be verified and received. (C) It is recommended to reform the currency system as soon as possible, so that prices will not fluctuate excessively and the value of the currency will not fall at any time during this budget period. (D) Efforts should be made to increase revenue, such as taking political methods against wealthy capital to make them donate. (E) For expenditures such as national defense expenditures, which account for 41.2% of the total budget, efforts must be made to ensure that the number of officers and soldiers in the army is verified and issued to reduce expenditures. (F) Increasing construction costs, although the percentage in the total budget is too small, the total amount cannot be increased again, that is, it should be evenly distributed with other expenses. Also, Wu's opinions will be discussed with Fan on the 15th, and then drafted. The Standing Committee of the Senate will adjourn on the 15th and continue the meeting on the 16th, and the opinion letter can be passed.

However, according to what the reporter learned, he is straightforward and has always been friendly to China. Although he came to China at the invitation of Ambassador Steve to revisit his "second hometown," if the ambassador discusses the unpleasant incident between China and Britain with him during his two-day stay in Beijing, his opinions will definitely help the smooth progress of the negotiations. After the Lord and Lady Killearn finished talking, they took a photo in front of the official residence at the request of the reporter, and signed it for this newspaper as a souvenir.

The reporter specially interviewed the Ministry of Food. According to reports, county-level field grain agencies were central agencies during the war, and after rehabilitation, they were changed to be subordinate to various county governments on July 1, 1946. Since January 1947, the required funds have been changed to be borne by the central government, provinces, and counties according to the percentage of the field tax grain obtained. Because the field tax for 1947 continued to be handled by levying in kind and lending, and the provinces and counties were unable to share the expenses, the required funds were fully funded by the central government again since July 1, 1947, but the county-level agencies are still subordinate to various county governments and have not been independent.

Editorial

### The Deterioration of the Kowloon City Incident — The Attitude We Should Adopt for Universal Discussion

The Kowloon City incident has suddenly deteriorated, resulting in a bloody tragedy. The Chinese people are universally indignant, and students in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are reportedly planning to strike and demonstrate. We deeply regret this development of the incident. Now that the situation continues to evolve, the first thing we must point out is that, no matter how this incident evolves, we must overcome emotion with reason. Looking at the developments of the past few days, we have seen that, on the part of our government, Foreign Minister Wang first summoned British Ambassador Stevenson to the Foreign Ministry on the 12th, sternly demanding that the London government immediately instruct the Governor of Hong Kong to cease all coercive actions in Kowloon City during this negotiation period and to no longer send police into the city. On the 8th, a written protest was submitted to the British Ambassador. After the Hong Kong government continued to send armed police into Kowloon City and incidents of injury to Chinese people occurred, the Guangdong Provincial Government immediately passed a resolution allocating 500 million yuan to assist the suffering residents of Kowloon City and dispatched Provincial Committee member Xiao Ciyin to Kowloon City with funds to express condolences. On the Hong Kong government's side, armed police were sent into the city to forcibly demolish houses, and gunfire resulted in a bloody incident. Its court even sentenced Kowloon City residents who resisted relocation to imprisonment, denying that the court had jurisdiction over Kowloon City. On the Kowloon City residents' side, public sentiment is high, and they are "vowing to die rather than leave" to safeguard our national sovereignty.

Regarding the Kowloon incident, we previously wrote an article arguing that Kowloon City itself is a place beyond the reach of the Hong Kong government's power, and even for the sake of public order, the people's livelihood should be stabilized first. The demolition of houses and forced relocation should not occur. Therefore, we hope that the British government and the Hong Kong authorities can recognize the long-term relationship between China and Britain and refrain from actions that would stimulate Chinese emotions. Now that this incident is increasingly deteriorating, we truly regret it. What we want to point out here is that the deterioration of this incident is not necessarily a reflection of the British government's policy. The main reason for the development of the incident is that the Hong Kong government has viewed it as a local incident, and in handling it, it has inevitably been too hasty. Within the Hong Kong government, there are many colonial officials who are indifferent to the emotions of the governed and are thus quite out of touch with the policies of the London government. Originally, Kowloon City is a trivial matter, and our Chinese people did not want to see this minor incident as overly serious in the current turbulent international situation, hoping that this incident could disappear without a trace. Now that the situation has developed to the current stage, our Foreign Ministry has submitted a protest to the British Ambassador. We deeply hope that the London government can quickly and effectively stop the Hong Kong government officials' atrocities and take necessary disciplinary actions against the responsible personnel of the Hong Kong government, so that this situation can be resolved. We firmly believe that the government led by Prime Minister Attlee, which has been able to implement Britain's withdrawal from India and grant independence to Burma, also has a long-term vision and will take swift and necessary measures regarding this Kowloon incident. It should be noted that Moscow is currently launching a propaganda offensive against Britain, and this Kowloon City incident is adding fuel to the fire. Prime Minister Attlee is far-sighted, and we believe that he certainly does not want this small incident to affect the overall situation.

What we want to point out further here is that the issue of Kowloon City is actually related to the entire issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon; even if we do not discuss the Hong Kong issue, it is also related to the entire issue of the Kowloon Leased Territory. From the perspective of Sino-British relations and the entire world situation, since Britain has withdrawn from India and granted independence to Burma, it should voluntarily return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. In the current war situation, Britain's retention of Hong Kong and Kowloon has no strategic significance for it and may even increase its burden. What it can give Britain is perhaps only the placement of a very small number of colonial officials and some adventurers; it is unwise to allow the friendship between China and Britain to be overshadowed by such people. When Churchill was the British Prime Minister during the war, he said that he did not want to preside over the end of the British Empire; it was under this circumstance that we had the signing of the Sino-British New Treaty, which did not touch upon the issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon. The current situation is significantly different from when Churchill was in power. We believe that the Attlee government can, based on its consistent enlightened policy, make a thorough and fundamental resolution to the issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon after India and Burma. If this Kowloon City incident can lead to an overall resolution of the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon issue, then the blood shed by the residents of Kowloon City will have even more valuable significance.

Furthermore, the spontaneous and passionate emotions of the Chinese people caused by the Kowloon City incident symbolize the abundance of the Chinese national vitality, which is very gratifying. However, what we want to point out here is that, in this incident, our government has already allocated funds from the Guangdong Provincial Government for relief and sent personnel to express condolences; and our diplomatic authorities are currently negotiating with Britain. Our people should unite to support the government with trust and avoid the expansion of the situation. As for students in various places, moved by righteous indignation, or intending to take action, it is originally a noble expression of patriotic sentiment, worthy of general admiration. However, strikes and demonstrations may not necessarily help to resolve the incident, and neglecting studies and affecting grades are directly related losses; moreover, Moscow is planning to launch a propaganda offensive against Britain. At a time when the country is mobilizing for war, it is inevitable that there are people who betray national interests, stirring up trouble. All our citizens should restrain their emotions, restore reason, and not increase the government's difficulties; then this Kowloon City incident may be resolved quickly and satisfactorily.

Finally, we deeply feel compelled to say that the Kowloon City incident was also caused by the Communist bandits' deliberate attempts to create chaos after the victory. If we had not had the Communist bandits' unrest after the victory, we might have already recovered Hong Kong and Kowloon. Because of the Communist bandits' unrest, we had to mobilize to suppress the rebellion; under these circumstances, our negotiations to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon could not be smoothly carried out, and the Hong Kong colonial officials were able to intensify these atrocities. The Communist bandits are also citing external forces, and most of our Northeast is still under foreign rule. If this continues, if the Communist bandits are not eliminated, the pain of national subjugation is not difficult to imagine. Now that the Kowloon City incident is deteriorating again, we hope that the Chinese people can better recognize the Communist bandits' poisonous harm to the country and rise up together to actively participate in the suppression of the rebellion: only when the bandit disaster is quelled can the Chinese people restore their healthy development. At that time, there will never be events like the current Kowloon City incident again.

### Missionaries Near Communist Areas are Retreating to Hankou

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] After the news of the American missionary being shot and killed by bandits in central Hubei spread, the American community here was quite shocked. This morning, the reporter interviewed Pastor Hanson, the person in charge of the American Church, and Mr. Becker, the American Consul in Hankou. Pastor Han expressed to the reporter in a heavy tone that, after this incident occurred, we are not able to express any opinions, but it can be said that the general bandits intended to rob property, and they do not easily harm people, especially not American personnel. Therefore, we judged that this completely abnormal atrocity must have been orchestrated by the Communist bandits. According to Consul Baker, as of now, we have not yet received a direct detailed report on this incident, so we do not want to give a definitive comment, but the tragedy has indeed occurred, and we are now handling the aftermath. The church has notified the missionaries near the Communist areas to retreat to Zhengzhou, Laohekou, and other safe areas as soon as possible, and then transport them to Hankou by special plane for centralization. Currently, all of the church’s St. Paul No. 72 plane has already flown to Zhengzhou for the first time this morning to pick up the missionaries, and Associated Press reporter Mi Hailou went with the plane. It is scheduled to make two round trips today and can pick up more than 60 missionaries. As for the withdrawal of missionaries from Hubei, because there is no civilian airport in Laohekou, we are now seeking temporary co-use from the Chinese Air Force. Once approved, we can fly to pick them up within days. As for the remains of the three murdered missionaries, they have been transported to Hankou by church personnel and will arrive within days and will be buried in Hankou. Finally, Mr. Becker said that, if there is transportation, the consulate is prepared to go to Jingmen for an on-site investigation in order to obtain direct information.

### Various Places Telegraph the Central Government to Conduct Strong Negotiations with Britain; Hong Kong's Chinese Newspapers are Righteous and Forceful

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Hankou Municipal Council passed a resolution requesting the government to seriously protest the Kowloon City incident.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 14th] The Jiangxi Provincial Council held a meeting of resident committee members today, and the Kowloon City incident was discussed. It was decided to telegraph the central government to conduct serious negotiations to protect sovereignty.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 14th] The Municipal Council is planning to ask the whole country to unanimously request the government to conduct strong negotiations on the Kowloon City incident.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] People are discussing the issue on the streets and expressing anger at the Hong Kong police for shooting and wounding our compatriots.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th] The Journalists Association of Bing sent a telegram to the whole country, calling on the people to rise up and support the government's strong diplomacy to maintain sovereignty over Kowloon City.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] The Island Daily commented on the Kowloon City incident, saying that it not only failed to resettle the displaced residents based on humanitarianism but also drove them into a more painful abyss. The Xinsheng Evening News said that yesterday's incident was not a warning shot by the police but aimed at killing people. The wounded residents were directly shot into the muscles by bullets. Leaving aside the standpoint of the country and nation, and from the standpoint of Hong Kong residents, Hong Kong's rule of law and administrative measures are definitely not allowed. The English-language South China Morning Post stated that the proposal to open a Kowloon City Park will be submitted to the Legislative Council meeting in the near future.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 14th] It is reported that Chinese leaflets were found in Kowloon City, stating that the Hong Kong police used machine guns to cause a bloody massacre. The police station is now investigating the source. It is said that the leaflets were a report from the Kowloon City Residents Association to Chairman Chiang, Foreign Minister Wang, Chairman Song of the Guangdong Provincial Government, the National Army, Navy, Air Force, and the people.

### Some Northeastern Technical Personnel Decide to Transfer to Jiangnan; Will Return North After the Situation Opens Up

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The National Resources Commission has recently decided to transfer senior technical personnel from the Northeast to Jiangnan in batches and has begun transportation under possible circumstances. Guo Xiangyu, manager of the Fuxin Coal Mine, recently arrived in Tanggu via Qinhuangdao by sea, accompanied by 60 technical employees. Other mining personnel are also moving south. It is reported that this measure was taken because the situation in the Northeast has not yet opened up, and most mines have stopped production. Thousands of technical personnel are trapped in that area, while the industrial development in Jiangnan urgently needs technical personnel. Therefore, this temporary measure is being taken. After the senior personnel from the various industrial and mining industries in the Northeast move south, some personnel will still be left to maintain production and manage equipment. Once the situation in the Northeast opens up, the commission will again draw personnel to go north. Sun Yueqi is currently inspecting in Hunan, planning to place the transferred personnel.

### Chennault Air Transport Team Will Open Ping-Shen Airlines

This is good news for Ping-Shen passenger and freight transportation, and China Airlines will encounter a powerful competitor.

### Jiangsu Province Recruiting 80,000 Soldiers; Military Meeting Opens Today

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 14th] The military service conference is scheduled to be held at 9:00 tomorrow morning at the Military Control District Command. Commanders of various divisions and regiments and county magistrates from both north and south of the Yangtze River have come to the province to report. It is said that the main topics of discussion at the conference are the quotas for each county and general technical issues related to conscription and delivery, new recruit management, and nutrition. How to arrange the resettlement fees for this year's conscription is expected to be a lively discussion. In addition, the conscription quota for this province is 80,000. Zhenjiang's quota is 1,742. Regarding the issue of age, it is reported that the Ministry of National Defense has recently given an explanation. The year of conscription for active-duty men of conscription age in the 37th year of the Republic (1948) is expected to be men born between 1923 and 1927, with the principle of conscripting men who have reached the age of 20. If a certain county has an inaccurate survey and fails to meet the quota due to missing men, it should extend the year to meet the quota. The above regulations were formulated in order to avoid affecting social order. If the extension is excessive, it will not only cause anxiety among the people and affect social order but also hinder the implementation of military service. Therefore, the year should be shortened as much as possible.

### Speakers of Pingjinji Provinces Arrive in Shanghai Together; Will Go to Nanjing to Present Important Suggestions

[Our News] Liu Yaozhang, Speaker of the Ji Provisional Council, Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Ping Provisional Council, Shi Zizhou, Speaker of the Tianjin Provisional Council, Ji Dianchuan, Chairman of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Li Zhulu and four others flew from Tianjin to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:00. They will go to Nanjing within days to meet with the authorities, requesting relief for the grain shortage in the north, restoration of industrial loans, and will present three important suggestions to revive the economy.

### Liu Yaozhang's Remarks

According to Speaker Liu Yaozhang, the reporter was informed that, in terms of the grain shortage, the food in North China could not be self-sufficient before the war, and it was entirely dependent on the support of the provinces of Henan, Northeast, and Northwest. Due to the current situation, the only area that can supply food to North China is the Yangtze River basin, but because transportation cannot be on time, and the demand for military grain in Hebei is urgent, in fact, there are still local requisitions. In addition, the bandit forces are disrupting the area, and the number of refugees is increasing day by day, flocking to the city to avoid the chaos, further exacerbating the urban grain shortage. At present, the price of flour in Beiping has risen to 1.1 million yuan per small bag (approximately 37 jin). With fluctuating grain prices, the hearts of the people in the north are also fluctuating. I hope that the authorities can eliminate all restrictions on the northward transportation of grain in the future, and supply foreign flour, or exchange coal from the north for rice from the south. When distributing US relief supplies, I also hope that more consideration can be given to the needs of the north. Regarding the restoration of industrial loans, it is even more urgent for the north, because the scope of industry in the north is small, so the support is also small. At present, some industries in the north have already reduced production due to the suspension of industrial loans. After the pressure of annual rewards, it is not easy to spend the Lunar New Year. If this matter cannot be handled well, it will turn from an economic problem to an unemployment problem, and then to a security and political problem. Therefore, we have to request the government to quickly restore industrial loans. As for the supervision method, it can be discussed in detail. The above two items are urgent issues at the moment. As for the fundamental plan, there are approximately three points:  Reward the import and export industries of the north.  All factories in North China that have started work should strive to maintain it, and those that have not started work should try their best to find ways to help them start work. According to my rough estimate, less than 20% of the enemy and puppet factories taken over in North China have resumed work.  The grain production in North China should be increased as much as possible. Of the 800,000 mu of land reclaimed by the Japanese in the past, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is continuing to operate only one-quarter. In the five-year production increase plan of Jilin, Hebei is not included in the first two years, which is really incomprehensible. I hope it can be revised. Regarding the overall situation in North China, Mr. Liu stated that, first of all, he hopes that Chairman Chu Xichun can come to Beiping to take office as soon as possible. In today's northern situation, the provincial government cannot be without a leader for a day. After the establishment of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, it can achieve unified command and flexible use of troops. If it can be coordinated with the establishment of local people's armed forces, the overall situation in the north can still be optimistic.

### The Silver Market in Changsha is Extremely Tight, and Stores are Hoping to Close Down

[Our Changsha Correspondent, 14th] The exchange rate of Chang-Sui has increased, and a large amount of Hunan cash has flowed out, resulting in an extremely tight silver market in Changsha. More than a dozen stores have closed down in the past two days, with some owing up to 20 billion yuan.

### The Jiangsu Provincial Government Telegraphs Orders to All Counties to Find Ways to Stabilize Grain Prices

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 14th] Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to the sharp increase in rice and grain prices to around 300,000 yuan per stone, and the increase in flour prices to around 100,000 yuan per bag, as well as the gradual rise in firewood, oil, salt, rice, and other items, affecting the lives of ordinary people, is very concerned. A telegram order has been issued to all county and municipal governments to find ways to stabilize prices before the end of the lunar year to stabilize people's livelihoods and social order.

### The National Army Holds the Initiative on All Battlefields - Deng Wenyi Reports on the Week's Military Situation

[Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on the week's military situation from January 8th to 14th of the 37th year of the Republic at a press conference on the 14th, stating:

Over the past week, the communist bandits in the Northeast attempted to steal Shenyang but suffered another defeat. Initially, the bandits concentrated a superior force in the area east of Gongzhuling in the Northwest and between Faku, attempting to strike the National Army and then threaten Shenyang. Although one division of the National Army suffered some losses in equipment, the National Army launched a multi-pronged offensive, encircling the bandits. Since the 8th, they have defeated the Lin Biao bandit's 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 10th columns on both sides of the Liao River and near Faku, completely annihilating the 35th, 34th, and 36th regiments of the bandit's 4th column. The bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, fled west and north in a panic. The situation west of Shenyang has stabilized.

In North China, after the National Army forces on the Pingbao Line joined forces, they again defeated the bandit's 3rd and 6th columns near Yaocun on the 9th, dispersing a force of more than five regiments and capturing more than 5,000 bandits. On the 10th, a unit of the National Army completely annihilated the 33rd Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the bandit's 3rd Column south of Dingxing. Since then, the National Army has been sweeping the area around Mancheng outside Baoding, and the Baoding garrison has also launched a brave counterattack. On the 11th, they routed approximately six regiments of the Nie Rongzhen bandit's 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns southeast of Mancheng, who fled in disarray into the mountains southwest of Mancheng, tending to disperse into smaller units. The battle on the Pingbao front is now in the mopping-up phase.

While the bandits were being forced to suppress on the Pinghan Line, the bandits in the Bohai Military Region and the coastal defense detachment gathered more than 4,000 bandits to launch a diversionary battle in the Xiaozhan area east of Tianjin, in order to alleviate the pressure on the Hebei-Henan-Shandong-Jiangsu 4th bandit army and threaten Tanggu. However, the National Army in that area, cooperating with a part of the local militia, swept the bandits, and recovered Xiaozhan on the morning of the 11th. The situation in that area has returned to stability.

The Liu Bocheng bandit troops in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui area were forced to flee in various directions due to the National Army's pressure from all sides, sometimes eastward and sometimes westward. Unable to escape the National Army's encirclement and suppression, they were also frequently ambushed by local militias, suffering from hunger, cold, heavy casualties. The 1st Column generally fled to Linruji, while the main force was at Baoxinji. The 2nd Column had crossed Xuanhuadian and fled west. The 3rd Column was fleeing in the area of Shijiaqiao, Yuexi, and Huangniushan. The 6th Column's main force was still dodging encirclement near Lishan. The remnants of the 10th Column were near Xinye, joining forces with the Chen Geng bandit troops, intending to besiege the militia of Deng County. Our Neixiang militia has gone to reinforce them. It is expected that the bandits will still have to flee. The 62nd Column, entrenched near the Dahong Mountains, fled to the vicinity of Suixian, while another group of more than 1,000 fled north of Zhongxiang, crossed the Xiang River, and fled to Hujiaji. The National Army is dividing its forces to pursue and suppress them.

The Chen Yi bandit's 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns in the Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan area, after failing in the battle of Heze, are currently scattered in the areas of Suixian, Ningling, and Liuhe south of the Longhai Railway. Their 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns are fleeing northeastward to the Taikang area, attempting to join forces with the bandits in the north. There are no major battles at present.

In southern Shanxi, the troops moving south from Taiyuan have successively recovered Huoxian, Zhaocheng, and Hongdong. After joining forces in Linfen, the elite National Army troops moving north began to advance towards Yuncheng from the east, west, and south on the 9th. They recovered Jiexian on the 10th and advanced north in victory, sweeping all before them. They recovered Yuncheng on the afternoon of the 12th. The two brigades of bandit troops defending the city were completely defeated. The bandits who escaped outside the city fled north in panic. The bandits' dream of occupying Yuncheng with six brigades of troops vanished in less than a month, and they sacrificed more than 10,000 troops. Following the victories after the New Year, there will be continuous victories. This has proven that the Chinese people's rise and the National Army's offensive have seized the initiative on the battlefield.

### Truman Proposes Ten-Year Prosperity Plan to Prevent Economic Panic - Anti-Inflation Bill Should be Passed

[United Press, Washington, 14th] President Truman stated in a report to Congress on the domestic economy that unless a tough anti-inflation bill is quickly implemented, the United States will face a severe recession. The increase in prices, wages, and profits in 1947 has become a step in the development of inflation and has caused serious difficulties and become a serious economic threat. Truman also predicted in the report that if Congress can pass a tough anti-inflation plan, then the production of the United States can still be improved and achieve general concrete prosperity. He said that the depletion of American family savings last year was an ominous sign. Truman's report stated that the employment performance of the people last year was very good. There were 60 million employed in June, and the annual average was 58 million. The unemployed were only 1.6% in November and December. If we hope that all the people in the country can be fully employed, then we need to add 700,000 new jobs. The number of jobs needed nationwide in the United States within ten years should be 64 million. After reviewing the economic situation last year, President Truman put forward detailed suggestions for 1948, implementing his ten-year prosperity plan. Finally, he issued a warning: regardless of whether it will affect inflation, the Marshall Plan must be implemented, otherwise the direct impact on various countries and the indirect impact on the United States will be unimaginable.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] President Truman stated in his annual economic report to Congress that the primary economic goal of this year is to curb the trend of inflation. The second goal of 1948 is to add 700,000 people to the labor force, increasing the number of employed people to 59 million, and increasing the total amount of goods and services, making it 3% more than the total value of goods and services in 1947, which was 226 billion US dollars. Mr. Truman stated that the United States' long-term economic plan should focus on three major areas: implementing a savings plan to protect and develop America's natural resources and capital, while expanding industrial equipment, transportation, and housing; developing human resources and productivity, expanding employment to a maximum of 64 million people in the next ten years, and providing everyone with greater opportunities in education, while establishing welfare institutions such as health insurance and social security throughout society; developing a highly productive economy, the implementation method of which is to eliminate monopolistic facilities and expand consumers' income through an active competition system to facilitate the distribution of goods, and adopt certain policies on agricultural taxation, debt management, and world trade.

### British and French Finance Ministers Meet Regularly to Discuss Economic and Financial Matters - Preparatory Meeting of Sixteen Nations Conference Postponed

[Reuters, London, 13th] It was officially announced here that French Finance Minister Mayer is scheduled to come to London next Thursday or Friday to meet with Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps to conduct a general review of economic and financial issues between Britain and France. The exchange rate between the sterling area and the franc area, as well as the exchange rate between the sterling/franc area and other countries, is also on the agenda. Observers believe that the talks between Cripps and Mayer will focus on matters related to the British and French economies. However, since Britain and France are the convening countries of the European Sixteen Nations Economic Cooperation Conference, the economic or financial resolutions they make and the future trends of the Sixteen Nations Conference may also cause repercussions. Furthermore, the British-French talks on reopening the European Sixteen Nations Conference, originally scheduled to be held today, will be postponed to the 14th because the French chief representative, Alphonse, Director of External Economic Affairs, and several other French representatives have not yet arrived.

### US Treasury Secretary Opposes Using European Deposits in the US to Offset Aid to Europe

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Treasury Secretary Snyder today strongly opposed the request for the sixteen European nations to use their deposits in the United States to help offset the costs required for the Marshall Plan for aid and reconstruction in Europe before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is said that as of the end of last June, the private deposits of various countries in the United States amounted to approximately 4.8 billion US dollars, which is insufficient to meet the needs of protecting the stability of the currencies of various countries. It would be unwise to force them to do this.

### US Senators Oppose Transfer of Ships to Europe

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Republican Senator Bartlett of California stated in the House of Representatives today that he opposed the Marshall Plan's suggestion to transfer 500 American ships to European countries, calling it a threat to American security and detrimental to the American shipping industry. According to the State Department's proposal, 300 American ships will be sold to the sixteen European nations, and another 300 will be temporarily transferred to the sixteen nations.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] US Ambassador to the UK Douglas stated to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, clarifying the point of selling 200 US ships to the sixteen European nations, saying that the sale of these ships is based on an installment payment method. In addition to 25% of the ship price that must be paid immediately, the remaining price will be paid in installments over several years. He also pointed out that the proportional allocation of world ship tonnage is conducive to the balance of world trade, and therefore is extremely beneficial to the establishment of peace.

### US Interior Secretary and Agriculture Secretary Unanimously Support Aid to Europe

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Agriculture Secretary Anderson expressed his views on the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, believing that there is no other way but to implement the European recovery plan in accordance with the amount recommended by the government.

### Aviation Policy Committee Recommends that the United States Strengthen its Air Defense to Cope with Future Atomic and Bacterial Warfare

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] President Truman previously appointed five experts to organize the Aviation Policy Committee to study the situation of the US Air Force. The committee issued a report today stating that by January 1, 1953, the United States will face an atomic day, at which time some foreign countries can almost certainly hold a large number of atomic weapons and may be able to mass produce long-range rockets. The committee advocated establishing a large bomber fleet, equipped with long-range rockets, to warn those who attempt to attack the United States, and tell them that if they attack the United States, their factories, cities, and war institutions will be destroyed.

The report advocated a radical reform of the United States' traditional strategic strategy in peacetime and proposed: advocating the completion of 7,000 front-line aircraft for the US Air Force by January 1, 1952, supplemented by 3,212 border defense aircraft and a reserve fleet of 8,100 aircraft; not assuming that other countries will not be able to mass produce atomic weapons by the end of 1952; not assuming that other countries will not be able to mass produce rockets with a range of 5,000 miles that can attack entire cities by the end of 1952; plans to prevent bacterial warfare must be stepped up. The report also said that research in atomic, bacterial, supersonic, and other fields, as well as the development of a suitable air force, must go hand in hand. The latter must be the basic tool of future national defense. The report divided the future into two stages: one is the current stage, which assumes that the United States continues to exclusively possess the secret of the atomic bomb; the other is that other countries have a large number of atomic weapons to attack the United States. In the first stage, the United States must continue to prepare for war before the disputes between the East and the West are resolved. In the second stage, the United States must have strong defensive equipment to reduce the effectiveness of enemy attacks to a minimum, and have a strong counter-attack force to immediately retaliate and occupy outpost strongholds to reduce the danger to the US mainland. Regarding funding, the committee advocated increasing the existing military budget of 10.98 billion US dollars to 11.59 billion US dollars in 1948, and to 13.2 billion US dollars in 1949.

### Japanese Government Purges Hirano - Katayama Cabinet Gets a Breather - Liberal Party's Activities Will Be Hit

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The Japanese Central Screening Committee suddenly changed its attitude in an unexpected action today, and voted to purge former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano Rikizo based on new evidence. This evidence shows that Hirano Rikizo is a member of the notorious radical nationalist organization "Tenkan Hiraki Renmei" (League to Open the Heavenly Gate). The purge of Hirano can give the Katayama government some guarantees to extend its term, and is a blow to the hopes of the Liberal Party. The "Tenkan Hiraki Renmei" was organized by Mitsui Sakichi, the lawyer who defended the naval officers implicated in the May 15th Incident. He is a leader of right-wing figures, and Hirano is one of the small group of members who have joined the organization.

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese Minister of Justice Suzuki said: As far as the signs of Japanese purged persons destroying the instructions of the Allied Headquarters are concerned, these purged persons are still engaging in behind-the-scenes political activities. All will be severely punished. This warning was issued after the Central Screening Committee purged former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano on the night of the 13th. Hirano's departure from the Socialist Party was only last week. He said: He will lead a new political party to overthrow the Katayama Cabinet. Prime Minister Katayama dismissed Hirano last November on the grounds that he failed to cooperate with the cabinet. The increasingly serious dispute between Katayama and Hirano caused Hirano and fifteen other Socialist Party Diet members to leave the party last week, planning to form a new party with the intention of overthrowing the Katayama cabinet. Some observers interpreted Suzuki's warning as being directed directly at Hirano and his supporters. Japanese observers unanimously concluded that Hirano's purge has relieved the Katayama cabinet of its difficulties at the beginning of the parliamentary reconvening on January 21. After Hirano was purged, he lost his position as a member of the Diet.

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Radical Party member Herriot was re-elected as Speaker of the National Assembly today with 317 votes. The other candidate, Communist Party member Cara, received 174 votes and was defeated. After the announcement of the election results, the National Assembly declared a recess, and the parliamentary groups of each party convened separately to nominate candidates for Deputy Speakers. The leaders of each party's parliamentary group then passed the following list of Deputy Speakers, which was submitted to the National Assembly for a vote: First Deputy Speaker: Le Roux of the Socialist Party; Second Deputy Speaker: Béroule of the People's Republican Party; Third Deputy Speaker: Duclos of the Communist Party. According to an agreement reached a year ago between the parties, the First Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly should be from the largest party in the parliament, i.e., the Communist Party. Today's list violated this agreement, so Duclos stated in the lounge that the Communist Party would refuse to hold office in the parliament to protest. Three hours later, the parliament reconvened, with Garcin, the oldest Communist Party member, as chairman. He announced that the leaders of the parliamentary groups had failed to reach an agreement on the nomination of Deputy Speakers, and that he had informed the President of the Republic of this matter. Before the President provides a response, the parliament will be adjourned until 2:00 PM tomorrow. Upon hearing this, most of the Communist Party members left the chamber. The remaining members smoked or discussed the incident loudly, and the chamber was in great disorder. Right-wing and centrist members shouted, "Go to Moscow!" Communist members responded with harsh words. Some right-wing members shouted for Vivollet, the Radical Party member who was next in age to Garcin, to take the chairman's seat. As Vivollet was about to take the seat, he was blocked by more than twenty Communist members. The chamber staff then advised the journalists in the audience to leave, and the lights in the chamber were gradually turned off, but the noise inside could still be heard intermittently.

### International Gold and Dollar Smuggling Ring Broken Up: Sixteen Key Suspects Arrested, Gold Bars Flown in from Mexico, Underground Hong Kong Exchange Handling Billions Daily

[Special Report] The Municipal Police Bureau yesterday cracked down on an international gold and dollar black market organization. The person in charge was a Russian named Maddox, manager of Maddox & Co. at 24 Central Road. Additionally, the foreign national involved in the black market and Xue Lianhuang, manager of Jian'an Bank, were arrested on the fifth floor of Jialing Building on Sichuan Road and at No. 27, Dongxing Lane. Thirteen other people were also arrested, including two White Russians and the rest were Chinese citizens. Over 220 taels of gold, more than $300 in US currency, and over 250 million in legal tender notes were seized.

The organization was divided into two parts. One part was responsible for international relations and acted as a representative selling gold and dollars, with Liao Quanqi as the chief representative. Liao's office was located in a room on the fifth floor of the Jialing Building at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road. The second part was the storage location for gold and dollars, located at Jian'an Bank, No. 27, Dongxing Lane, managed by Xue Lianhuang. The warehouse was located at No. 16 in the same lane. Jian'an Bank was also a well-known Hong Kong exchange dealer, with daily transactions exceeding 100 billion. The source of the gold and dollars sold by the organization was also arranged by Jian'an Bank sending secret telegrams to foreign countries. The sales agency for gold and dollars was Maddox & Co., managed by Maddox.

According to investigations, the gold sold by the organization was produced in Mexico and flown to Shanghai by plane. After the gold arrived in Shanghai, Liao would deposit it at Jian'an Bank, and then Maddox & Co. would sell it.

After the financial management and economic inspection authorities became aware of the situation, at 10:00 AM on the 14th, police officers disguised as customers went to Maddox & Co. to purchase gold bars, issuing two checks. One check was for 1,818,500,000 yuan to purchase 17 large gold bars, and the other was for 1,680,000,000 yuan to purchase 16 large gold bars. Maddox & Co. believed them and Liao Quanqi delivered the goods. The police officers then followed Liao to the Jialing Building to pick up the goods. At the same time, other police officers who had been waiting locked down Maddox & Co., cutting off external communication, and searched the premises for five hours, obtaining a great deal of evidence. Maddox was arrested on the spot and a check for 18,000,000 yuan, obtained from the sale of US dollars, was found on his person. He confessed that Maddox & Co.'s business was import and export, and sometimes they did stock trading. In 1946, they had dealt with gold and dollars. He also revealed that a foreign friend was running the gold and dollar black market, using the company to "launder money."

The police officers also detained a White Russian woman named Yavofumi, who claimed to be from Jilin Province in Northeastern China and lived at No. 902, Lane 265, Changle Road, working as a tailor and a friend of Maddox's wife. 263 US dollars and 25 cents were found on her person. She claimed that the money belonged to her American friend. Another White Russian, Xue Aofu, and Chinese citizens Zhao Zhishen, Qiu Xiankun, and Huang Fuhan were also arrested. Checks and cash totaling 250,068,000 yuan were found on Huang Fuhan's person. All were suspected of serious crimes and taken into custody for further investigation.

Liao Quanqi in the Jialing Building was unaware of what had happened at Maddox & Co. Liao first handed over 16 large gold bars to the police officers disguised as customers, and then called Jian'an Bank to send someone to deliver the remaining goods. After waiting for a long time, a Jian'an Bank employee named Ma Weiheng arrived and said that some of the checks needed to be exchanged for cashier's checks. The police officers took him up on his offer, and one of them accompanied Ma Weiheng outside, where he was arrested and taken into custody.

In the Jialing Building, the police officers disguised as customers had a very pleasant conversation with Liao Quanqi. Soon after, two other Jian'an Bank employees, Ye Jinyuan and Ye Defa, arrived with four and a half large gold bars. Including the previous delivery, a total of twenty and a half gold bars had been delivered, still twelve and a half short of the required amount. They agreed to go to Jian'an Bank to pick up the remaining goods. The four of them took two three-wheeled military vehicles to Jian'an Bank. Plainclothes police officers followed and set up a dragnet around the area. At Jian'an Bank, they handed over another gold bar. They said that the remaining goods still needed to be obtained from another location. After waiting for a long time without any news, the investigators, fearing that the news would leak out, revealed their true identities and arrested all the suspects. In addition to Liao Quanqi, Ye Jinyuan, and Ye Defa, the police arrested Xue Lianhuang, manager of Jian'an Bank, Lin Shangbai, an employee (whose person contained a code book for gold and dollar transactions), Tang Jinshui (whose person contained 115 US dollars and a gold pendant), Zhong Jinding (whose diaries contained records of gold and dollar transactions), and Yang Jiqian and Chen Dong, whose persons contained important account books and receipts for foreign exchange and domestic remittances. Later, the police went to No. 16, Baoxing Lane, to search the warehouse and found another large gold bar (for a total of 22 and a half bars). Ma Xianglin, the person in charge of guarding the warehouse, had already fled and was not apprehended.

[Special Report, Nanjing, 14th] The case of the theft of a seven-carat diamond ring from a patron named Gu at the Shanghai Guotai Yue Opera Theater on November 27 of last year has been solved in Nanjing on the 13th. After the case occurred in Shanghai, more than 40 suspects were arrested, and it was learned that it was committed by a theft gang led by Xu Di. However, at that time, the Xu gang had dispersed and fled. Among them, Da Guiying and others came to Nanjing via Suzhou and Wuxi. The Shanghai Police Bureau had sent many people to Nanjing to contact and investigate with the Capital Northern District Police Bureau. At noon on the 13th, the Northern District Police Bureau found a suspicious woman in a public bus heading south on Shanxi Road. They followed her closely after she got off the bus at Xinjiekou, and soon arrested her while she was committing another theft, revealing the truth about the Shanghai theft case. According to her confession, the thief in the case was Xu Di's five-year-old daughter, Mao Mao. Initially, Ms. Gu's large ring on her finger was eye-catching, and they began to follow her after Ms. Gu finished her dinner somewhere. When they arrived at the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, Xu Di held Mao Mao and sat next to Ms. Gu in the empty seat left by a friend, and said that if someone came, she would return to the back row. At that time, there was still an empty seat between Xu Di's mother and daughter and Ms. Gu. After a while, Ms. Xu said she was tired, so she had Mao Mao sit in the empty seat next to Ms. Gu. Soon, Mao Mao stole the large diamond ring from Ms. Gu's finger and put it in her purse. Mao Mao's grandfather and two generations were all habitual thieves, and with the teaching of her mother, her technique was light and skillful, and Ms. Gu did not notice it. A few minutes after Mao Mao got the diamond, she said she needed to go to the bathroom urgently. Xu Di deliberately told her the direction of the toilet and asked Mao Mao to go by herself. Mao Mao did not return for a long time after she left, so Xu Di pretended to be anxious and left, falsely claiming to be looking for her daughter. And Ms. Gu did not realize that the ring was stolen until she wanted to put the ring back on after the theater was over. According to Da Guiying's confession, Xu Di has taken Mao Mao to Hong Kong in order to sell the diamond ring. After the Beijing Northern District Police Bureau solved the case, each branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau went to pick up the people. The Northern District Police Bureau handed over the case to the New City Branch Bureau, which was under its jurisdiction, and detectives from the New City Branch Bureau escorted Da Guiying to Shanghai by express train in the afternoon of the 14th.

### True and False Wife Case: District Prosecutor's Office Indicts Three Defendants, Forging Certificates to Obtain Travel Expenses, Violating the Regulations on Punishing Corruption

[Special Report] The case of Xie Jiashu, the person in charge of the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, Xu Liangyi, the director of the Shanghai City Bank Nanshi Office, and Xu's wife Gao Qinqiu, who were accused of corruption, has been prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. The indictment stated that Xie Jiashu and Xu's wife Gao Qinqiu became acquainted while working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing. In March of the 35th year of the Republic of China, Xie was appointed as the person in charge of the consulate in San Francisco. Before going abroad, they colluded with each other, and Gao falsely divorced her husband Xu Liangyi. Xu knew that this fact was false, and because he was living with another woman at the time, his wife Gao Qinqiu interfered, so he also falsely claimed that both parties had divorced. Xie and Gao then forged marriage certificates and other documents, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved the travel expenses for family members of diplomatic officials, totaling US$862. Soon after Xie Jiashu left the country for the United States, Gao and her husband Xu Liangyi came to Shanghai from Chongqing and lived together in one place. The accuser, Li Rongni, filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office. After investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, the defendants Xie Jiashu, Gao Qinqiu, and Xu Liangyi were found to have committed crimes under Article 1, Paragraph 1, and Article 3, Item 7 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The defendant Xu Liangyi should be punished in accordance with Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and a public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Huang Xing Road Bridge: Discovery of Wasteland Body; Homicide Case Solved; Generational Feud Resolved and Rekindled; Fishmonger's Tragic Murder in Shanghai; Six Suspects, Male and Female, Apprehended

[Report from this Newspaper] On the morning of the 15th of last month, the Xinshi Street Police Precinct discovered a male corpse on a wasteland near the Huang Xing Road bridge. The victim's hands were tied behind his back, and his head had multiple knife wounds, almost severed. The police station immediately reported the case to the Police Headquarters, and Chief Detective Hou urgently dispatched Squad Leader Zhu Mengwei, Deputy Squad Leader Chen Xianrong, Ma Feimu, and officers Liu Yuliang and Xu Youyi, along with photographers Shen Zhijian and Fang Meifa, to investigate. A paper identity card was found on the deceased, bearing the name Zhang Xi'an, thirty-three years old, from Huaian. Two cards were also found with the address "No. 2 Jiangnan, Zhongshan South Road, Sixteen Pu; Shui Ji Fish and Crab Shop, Yan Zuxiang." An investigation at Yan's establishment revealed that the deceased was indeed Zhang Xi'an, who had recently arrived from his hometown to sell carp in Shanghai, entrusting the shop to handle the sales. His Shanghai residence was No. 75 Chaomi Bang, Gonghe New Road. Based on these leads, the police successively detained three suspects: Zhang Shikuan, Zhang Wangzhu, and Zhang Mingjin. However, after interrogation, the cause of Zhang's death and the names of the murderers remained unknown. At that time, the chief, considering the

Gruesome Circumstances

of the murder, determined that the case was definitely not an ordinary revenge killing. Besides sending the arrested suspects to the District Procuratorate for investigation, Chief Zhu was ordered to lead his entire squad to continue the investigation. After more than twenty days of intensive inquiries, which extended to various places between Nanjing and Shanghai, the whole case began to unravel at the beginning of this month, revealing that it was caused by a generational feud and a cycle of revenge. Apart from the main perpetrators, Li Bingzhen, Li Shanshan, and Li Xueke, who are still at large, six other suspects have been apprehended (see picture): Ma Hongsheng, and accomplices Zhang Shaoyun, Liu Desan, Sun Xiong, Li Tongcai, and Ma Qishi. As of yesterday, the investigation concluded and it was determined that today the case would be

Charged as Murder

and transferred to the District Procuratorate for further processing. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the suspects were transported to the scene in a "Flying Fortress" to reenact the crime. Sun Yuanfang, Director of the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau, forensic examiners Liang Hanfen and Zhao Xianzhang, and Chief Detective Hou were also present, and Fang Meifa from the photography division photographed the circumstances of the murder. It turns out that the deceased, Zhang Xi'an (see picture), was the current head of the Hometown Defense Team in Wangqiao Township, Huaian. He was normally a capable person, but the neighboring Gao and Li clans had a longstanding feud. The number of mutual killings over the generations was countless. When Zhang was in charge, after much persuasion, both sides

Ended the Feud

and Zhang Xi'an adopted Li Bingmei's (the deceased former husband of Ma Qishi) son from the Li clan, hoping that the two clans would live in harmony forever. Unexpectedly, Li Bingmei was brutally murdered by communists last year. Afterward, the Li clan accused Zhang of deliberately provoking the incident and using the communists to kill Li Bingmei, thus reigniting the hatred. Not long after, the township head Gao Debiao and deputy township head Li Xueke gathered clansmen like Li Hua and provided them with firearms, instigating them to rob, and

Framing Zhang

by claiming that the firearms were provided by Zhang's Hometown Defense Team. Unexpectedly, Li Hua was arrested shortly after and confessed the whole story. Zhang, in order to prove his innocence, announced the details publicly, forcing Gao and Li to flee their hometown and seek refuge in Nanjing. Due to financial difficulties, they made a living pulling rickshaws in Nanjing. However, their determination to kill Zhang had already taken root, and the Lis secretly sought out fellow villagers in Nanjing who had a longstanding feud with Zhang's clan, so that they could join forces. Soon, a man named Li Bingzhen claimed that two of his brothers had also been killed by Zhang and was willing to join the

Common Cause.

At that time, Li Xuexuan, due to physical reasons, left Nanjing for Shanghai and stayed at Zhang Yuncheng's residence at No. 75 Chaomi Bang, Gonghe New Road. On the 9th of last month, Zhang Xi'an brought six loads of lotus carp and dozens of catties of vermicelli to Shanghai for sale. On the same day, he stayed in the house of his nephew, Zhang Wanchun, across from Zhang Liancheng's house. Li, seeing a rare opportunity, immediately sent a letter to Nanjing at night, notifying Li Bingzhen and urging him to come to Shanghai to seek revenge. After receiving the letter, Li invited a clansman, Li Chongshan, and rushed to Shanghai on the 13th, first going to Ma Qishi's house in Hongzhen for a secret meeting, encouraging Ma to

Avenge Her Late Husband.

Through Ma Qishi's lover, Ma Hongsheng, they managed to hire three accomplices, Zhang Shaoyun, Sun Xiong, and Liu Desan, for six million yuan. On the evening of the 14th, while Zhang Yuncheng was inviting Zhang to dinner, they bought a bull-ear knife at Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 2223 Tongbei Road, and then hired a car with license plate No. 220144 at Jinli Car Rental Shop at No. 1182 Daming Road. They dragged Zhang out, pushed him into the car, and drove west. During the journey, they

Tied His Hands Behind His Back

with a straw rope. When they arrived at the Huang Xing Road bridge, they asked the driver to stop, paid him the fare, and then Li Bingzhen, Ma Hongsheng, and others took action. They first stabbed Zhang's neck with the sharp knife. After he fell to the ground, they stabbed him several more times, attempting to sever his head. At that time, Zhang Shaoyun, Liu Desan, and Sun Xiong were terrified and fled. Li and the others stopped their actions, threw the murder weapon into a nearby stream, buried it in the mud, and then fled. The police are currently

Pursuing the Main Perpetrators, who are still at large.

### Unblocking Water Transport, Facilitating Grain Supply; Suzhou Creek Implements One-Way Traffic System for Vessels

[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu, concerned that the narrowness of Suzhou Creek and the large number of vessels passing through frequently caused congestion during the winter low-water season, severely affecting the grain supply, personally instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to dredge the creek to facilitate grain transport. Yesterday at noon, Ji Ming, Section Chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kexiao, Chief of the Water Police Precinct, Huang Jiaju, Specialist of the Municipal Government, and Mi Shang, grain merchant Cha Baoshan, conducted an on-site survey of the congested areas around Beixinjing, Zhuzhai, and Huangdu.

During incoming tide, vessels are only allowed to enter; during outgoing tide, vessels are only allowed to exit; during slack tide, the period is for preparation. Such orderly entry and exit can reduce congestion. The group returned to Shanghai at 4:00 PM.

### "Miss Shanghai" Suffers Mental Anguish; Unable to Bear His Way of "Loving"; Also for a Miss Zhang, a Dance Hostess; Affectionate but Separated by a Great Divide

[Report from this Newspaper] "Miss Shanghai" Xie Jiahua has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. She flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong on July 2nd last year to film a movie for Great China Film Company. It is said that the film contract was signed before her marriage. Later, Xie met and married Rong Meishen in less than two months. She didn't have time to mention this matter to Rong. After their marriage, Rong was very strict with Xie, causing friction in the family. He also stopped Xie's filming plan. Because of her passion for film, she resolutely left without saying goodbye. On December 3rd, Rong tracked her to Hong Kong and asked friends to Xie to the Repulse Bay Hotel, ordering Xie to return to Shanghai immediately. Xie argued that she had to compensate the film company for the losses stipulated in the contract. Rong demanded that she return to Shanghai first. During the argument, Rong suddenly pushed Xie down, tightly gripping her throat, and said, "I love you! I love you to death!" Xie, seeing this scene as if it were from a horror movie, screamed frantically. At that time, representatives from Great China Film Company came to pick Xie up for filming and wanted to call the police, but Xie stopped them.

The news spread to Shanghai, and Xie's mother, in a state of panic, rushed to Hong Kong on the 5th, intending to argue with Rong. Seeing the stalemate, Rong, to avoid embarrassment in a foreign land, did not meet with Xie's mother and flew back to Shanghai on the same day. Great China invited Xie to star in the film "Miss Shanghai," which was then completely rewritten, using the Repulse Bay incident as a basis. The title was changed to "Scandal," and Xie herself told the story. Filming was completed by the end of December.

After marrying Rong, Xie rejected social engagements. She said that during her stay in Hong Kong, apart from filming, she did not attend any banquets, hoping to please Rong and pledge eternal love. However, Rong was involved with a Miss Zhang, a dance hostess, and bought a new house for her. After suffering this mental stimulation, she decided to go to Hong Kong. At the time, there were rumors that she had eloped, but Xie said, "With my current status and the title of Miss Shanghai, I don't need to seek any more false fame and wealth. Going to Hong Kong to film was partly because of my love for film art, but it was also because I was too mentally distressed. The fact that I left Shanghai without saying goodbye also proves that Mr. Rong was not staying home every night, otherwise, I could have discussed everything with him."

When Xie returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong the other day, Rong and Xie's cousin, Xie Ziying, were both at the airport to greet her. Rong asked Xie to go with him, but she refused. Rong said to Xie Ziying, "She is my wife!" Xie Ziying said, "She is my sister!" Rong then said, "I love her!" Xie said, "Are you going to love her to death again?" In the end, they parted on bad terms.

According to Xie, Rong seemed to still express his love for her, and she was also considering Rong's reputation. However, the dance hostess whom Rong loved was extremely fierce, and Rong was afraid of her power. Therefore, although they were affectionate, there was still a great divide between them. Rong stated that he would never divorce Xie, while Xie, through her former lawyer, proposed to Rong that unless he guaranteed that he would no longer abuse Xie in any way and ended his relationship with the dance hostess Miss Zhang, Xie would return to her husband's house. However, Miss Zhang is currently pregnant and awaiting childbirth, so it seems that a considerable amount of time will be required.

Since returning to Shanghai, Xie has only met with Rong once at the airport. Since then, they have not met again. She has now moved to a relative's home. Because she is very interested in films, she still intends to star in another film. It is said that a film company in the city is in contact with her.

### Tragedy in Changsha; Older Brother Wounds Father with Knife; Younger Brother Kills Older Brother with Hoe

[Report from Changsha, 9th] Our country is a society that emphasizes reason. The relationships between ruler and subject, father and son, brothers, husband and wife, and friends are the "Five Relationships" that everyone has always respected. This ethical concept is a good way to maintain social morality. Although it cannot be said that our country's social order has relied entirely on this ethical concept for decades, its component must occupy a large weight, which is undeniable. A utilitarianism is currently popular in society. Our country's old-fashioned ethical concepts are gradually declining, but with deep roots, this thousands-year-old ethical concept still remains in the minds of most people. In this era of transformation, a piece of news that "ethics and law" are fighting has appeared in Changsha, attracting the attention of most people. The thing is like this:

In the countryside of Changsha

Zhoujiaba, the seventh bao of Guan township, a gentry surnamed Zhou wearing a blue cloth gown, villagers called him "Third Uncle Zhou," had a well-to-do family and no occupation, relying entirely on inheritance to live. Since the Anti-Japanese War, prices have soared, and life has gradually become unbearable, making him a declining family. He had two sons, the eldest son, Zhou Shoulin, did not finish his studies, wandered around, and gambled for a living. In Zhoujiaba, he had a nickname called "Half Leper" because he did not engage in proper business. After finding a wife for him, he separated and lived aside. The property he was divided into was twelve mu of land and several earthen houses. Shoulin

Became Independent After Dividing the Family.

After that, his behavior became even more unrestrained. In a few years, he gambled away all twelve mu of ancestral property. Recently, his wife, children, and children were all trapped in hunger and famine. He personally went to Changsha for three days and Tongguan for four days (Tongguan is thirty li away from Changsha), and his situation became even more messed up.

The second son, Zhou Shougang, was born when the family was no longer as glorious as before. Then followed the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. During this difficult period, he went from elementary school to middle school. By the end of the Anti-Japanese War, which was the spring of the Republic of China in the twenty-third year, the last batch of family fields was sold by his brother, and he was finally unable to continue his studies. He joined the youth army. In the past few years, his brother was immersed in alcohol and gambling, and his younger brother carried a gun and endured the torrents of the great era. The two people developed in two extremely different directions.

In December, Changsha had a heavy snow, and the poor could not bear the suffering of hunger and cold. The old and weak turned to the ditch, while the strong went on the road of crime. Although Zhou Shoulin did not become a bandit, he committed

An Unethical Crime

came. One morning, Zhou Shoulin was eager, took a kitchen knife, and went to his father's residence, threatening his father to take out the old-age land deed for him to sell. The father naturally refused. Shoulin, taking advantage of his father's unpreparedness, slashed with the kitchen knife. The third father was old and weak and naturally unable to resist. The tip of the knife hit his forehead, and blood flowed straight down, and he fainted on the ground. After Shoulin injured his father, he calmly went into the room to search for the land deed. It was a narrow road for the enemy. Shoulin's younger brother, Shougang, had recently returned home on leave from the youth army. When he returned from outside, he saw his old father lying in a pool of blood and did not know what was going on. He rushed into the room and saw his brother was searching for the land deed. Knowing that the murderer of his father was originally his brother, he could not suppress his anger. He gave his brother two slaps in the face. Shoulin was now either all in or all out. He took up the

A Hoe

Swung at Shougang. Shougang was quick and dodged aside. He grabbed a bench with his hand and used the legs of the bench to hook Shoulin's neck and pulled hard. Shoulin fell down. Taking advantage of the gap, he took the hoe from Shoulin's hand, raised his hand and hoeed. The brother who killed his father died tragically under the hoe of his brother.

After Shougang killed his brother, he did not run away. He rescued his father and took care of the funeral. After everything was settled, he then reported to the family and asked for a separation. "My brother killed my father, and I killed my brother. It has nothing to do with others. I will never implicate others." The villagers of Xiangdang expressed sympathy for Shougang's killing of his brother, but the national law does not allow Shougang to do this. Paying with one's life for murder, Shougang was finally arrested by the Xiang Township office on the evening of December 21. Now, the official authorities want to punish Shougang, but the people of the Zhou Family Ancestral Hall are unwilling to do so and are appealing for Shougang. What will happen to this case in the future remains to be seen. (Our special correspondent Huang Chao Ru)

### Wuxi Warehouse Director Robs Account Books, Sends Personnel to Collect Military Rice and is Detained

[This newspaper, Yixing, 12th] The Xiecheng Rice Mill outside the East Gate of this county is established by Wu Wanbang and others with joint investment, and its business is not bad. Last year, due to processing military grain for the government, its internal management was not well-organized, leading to a chaotic state. Ye Changgen, the accountant of the mill, was once detained for failing to deliver military grain on time. However, due to the inability to reconcile the incoming and outgoing accounts with those who handled and delivered the military grain, he found it extremely difficult to settle the accounts for a while. In order to cope with the payment of military grain, he had no choice but to use the rice stored by various households to make advances, and at the same time announced the suspension of business. The manager, Wu Wanbang, is weak in nature and unable to handle the aftermath properly, facing a difficult situation. The details are recorded as follows:

Excessive Grain Delivery

The military rice processed by the mill has always been sent to the Wuxi warehouse by personnel. Recently, it was discovered that the receipts for the processed rice delivered in the past did not match, with significant discrepancies. Therefore, on the 3rd of this month, two staff members, Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng, were sent to Wuxi to settle the accounts. However, Zhang Chenglun, the director of the warehouse, initially made various excuses and then claimed that 400 large packages of military grain were still missing, constantly shirking responsibility and refusing to settle the accounts. The Xiecheng Mill was supposed to deliver 1,100 packages of military grain but actually delivered 1,126 packages, with a surplus of 26 packages, all supported by account statements.

Robbing Receipts

Director Zhang Chenglun (who has been dismissed) knew that the truth would be revealed, so he secretly instructed others to mediate, asking Xiecheng Mill to deliver another 100 packages as a settlement. Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng did not accept this. On the 4th, Zhang Chenglun, along with staff members Jiang Yanling, He Pingao, and others, went to Room 22 of the Pacific Hotel in Wuxi, where Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng were staying, claiming to settle the accounts. Jiang and Wang believed them and were preparing to take out the receipts issued by the warehouse. Unexpectedly, Zhang Chenglun, Jiang Yanling, and others pulled out pistols and threatened Jiang and Wang to hand over the receipts and be done with the matter. Jiang and Wang refused, so Zhang and Jiang resorted to punches and kicks and made shooting gestures with their pistols. Jiang and Wang were unable to resist, and all seven account books and receipts were robbed.

Improperly Withdrawing Military Rice

Zhang Chenglun believed that the account books and receipts carried by Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng had been robbed back and there was no evidence. Therefore, he demanded that they make up for the 400 packages of military rice owed, otherwise he would not settle the accounts. Jiang and Wang then made the excuse that they needed to ask the mill for a decision before settling the accounts. Jiang and Wang quickly returned to Yixing that night to report to the mill. Zhang Chenglun, in order to take preemptive action before Jiang and Wang returned to Yixing, on the same day sent Jiang Yanling and Chen Bingnan, the former warehouse distribution section chief, to Yixing by car under the pretext of collecting sacks, intending to extort 400 packages of warehouse rice from the mill to enrich their own pockets.

Seized Secret Letters

Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng, staff members of the Xiecheng Mill, learned about this. They knew that Jiang Yanling and Chen Bingnan were both former employees of the Wuxi warehouse and that Jiang Yanling was the one who threatened them with a pistol and robbed the receipts. This clearly indicated that they were colluding to fraudulently obtain military grain. On the morning of the 9th, they prepared a document and handed over Jiang and Chen to the Xiaohou District Office. District Chief Ou, at the request of the defendants, found two extremely suspicious letters on Jiang and Chen, revealing the malfeasance on paper. It was originally intended to hand them over to the county, but because Jiang and Chen both claimed to be current employees of the provincial government, the matter was purely the work of the former warehouse director Zhang Chenglun alone. Only after Zhang Chenglun arrived at the scene could the truth be revealed. At the moment, Chen Bingnan has rushed to Wuxi to bring Zhang Chenglun to Yixing for settlement, while Jiang Yanling is being monitored. Once Zhang Chenglun is brought to justice, the truth should be revealed.

In order to handle the case with caution, Presiding Judge Fang Junjie, along with Judges Gu Yang, Prosecutor Wei Guanghan, and Clerk Fang Yingxu, specially formed a collegial panel to hear the case. Because this case is the most significant one handled since the establishment of the court, all parties are paying close attention, and the gallery was full by 9 o'clock.

Plaintiffs Li Zhenxu (Li's eldest son, employed at the Hankou Jiaotong Bank), Li Zhenzhong (second son, working in the engineering field in Peiping), Li Zhenjun (third son, currently a lecturer at National Central University in Nanjing), and Li Zhirui all appeared in court on time to answer questions. The plaintiffs unanimously stated that the defendant, Yuan Wenbin, harbored resentment because he failed to defeat Li in the election for senator. After the defendant, Luo Zhannong, became the district chief of Shangxian District, Li requested the authorities to replace him due to poor governance. Luo also had a close friendship with Yuan Wenbin and had supported Yuan's senatorial campaign. The two are suspected of instigating the murder. Next, the defendants Yuan Xiping and others were interrogated one by one. The defendants Chen Juqing and others all denied any involvement in the case. The entire trial lasted for four hours. Because the defendants uniformly retracted their confessions from the military court, the case became even more complicated. The court decided to postpone the trial for further investigation. Luo Zhannong and Yang Zhengjun were detained, and the remaining defendants were returned to custody.

### "Migratory Boil" and "Migratory Phlegm"

— Zhu Renkang

"Migratory boils" are not to be feared, "migratory phlegm" is the most serious

Ordinary people only think that "migratory boil" is a serious disease in surgery, but they don't know that "migratory phlegm" is more serious than "migratory boil". Although "migratory boil" and "migratory phlegm" are both external diseases and their conditions are very similar, they are actually very different.

"Migratory boil" is extremely rare among people in cities. On the contrary, farmers in rural areas work hard all day long, and they are most likely to develop "migratory boil" due to labor injuries and blood stasis. This disease can occur everywhere. At the beginning, the swollen area does not change in skin color, does not turn red, is swollen and has no head, but it causes pain. After about one or two weeks, the pain increases, the swelling expands, it does not subside with cold or heat, and pus has formed inside. It is still not easy to detect on the outside. Only an experienced doctor can diagnose it. It is advisable to have surgery quickly. The pus is thick and plentiful, even several bowls. With proper treatment, it can be closed in ten to twenty days, which is a mild case.

"Migratory phlegm" is different. There are quite a few patients in Shanghai. What we come into contact with is usually mistaken for migratory boils, but most of them are this kind of "migratory phlegm". People in cities are usually pampered and well-maintained, but their physical constitutions are weak, so they are prone to this kind of tuberculous external disease, and it can occur everywhere. At the beginning, there is a lump that is slightly swollen but does not feel any pain. Because it does not feel pain, it is left untreated. After a year and a half, it feels painful and you think of seeking treatment, then it is too late. It eventually becomes soft and suppurates, flowing with yellow water mixed with rotten chunks, and cannot be closed. The wound is recessed. Because it does not close, it is mistaken for a fistula, but it is not a fistula. The body becomes more and more weakened. If there are also symptoms such as coughing, night sweats, and tidal fever, it becomes pulmonary tuberculosis. If it can be treated early, and attention is paid to maintaining the body, cultivating and nourishing it, there is also hope for a cure.

Regarding the points of differentiation between the above two diseases, "migratory boil" rises quickly, either dissipates or suppurates, so it heals quickly. "Migratory phlegm" rises very slowly, so it is difficult to cure!

### Why is a Child Thin? Related to Worm Disease

— Xu Zhongcai

Parents are very concerned about their children being thin and often try every means to find ways to nourish them, but the effect is minimal. Why is this?

You must know that if a child has no other symptoms, but is only pale and thin, listless, and the body is getting weaker day by day, and the stool is loose, sometimes constipated, then you should suspect worm disease. Worm diseases include roundworms, tapeworms, duodenal worms, whipworms, etc.

Almost everyone knows about roundworms. They are similar to earthworms and lay eggs in the human body. They are excreted with feces. Chinese people usually use feces as fertilizer, which is often attached to vegetables and fruits. If they are not cooked thoroughly, children who eat them will also have worm disease.

Tapeworms have flat bodies, connected by a number of segments. The longest can reach several feet. They are mostly transmitted by eating undercooked fish, beef, pork, etc., and parasitize in the intestines.

Whipworms mostly parasitize near the cecum and are less harmful to the human body.

Children with duodenal worms, which are three to five minutes long, often have special hobbies, such as eating soil, paper scraps, cloth scraps, charcoal ash, etc.

Treatment should distinguish which type of worm disease it is and administer the appropriate anthelmintic. In addition, it is advisable to assist digestion and supplement nutrition. The machine child pills and eight treasure cakes sold in pharmacies can be eaten regularly.

### Stroke

— Cheng Guoshu

Stroke is a disease with distinctions between stroke-like conditions and true stroke. They are described separately below:

"Stroke-like conditions" are called cerebral hemorrhage by Western medicine. Those affected are mostly over forty years old, especially obese people. It originates from arteriosclerosis in the elderly, where miliary aneurysms occur in the blood vessels in the brain, and blood pressure is high, that is, the amount of blood flowing into the brain is large and the pressure increases, causing the blood vessels to rupture and bleed. There are sudden symptoms such as loss of consciousness and speech, fixed eyes and blank stare, locked jaw, rattling sounds in the throat, coarse breathing, or hemiplegia. If the mouth is open and the eyes are closed, the pulse is thin and weak, and there is urinary incontinence, danger is imminent. It is mostly caused by severe physical shocks, sudden falls, head injuries, or special mental excitement, excessive drinking, overeating, prolonged mahjong games, or strenuous efforts during bowel movements, or prolonged bathing, all of which can cause high blood pressure and lead to stroke-like symptoms. Antelope horn is an essential medicine for this disease. It can lower blood pressure and has the effect of preventing cerebral hemorrhage, but it must be used heavily, otherwise it will be ineffective. After consciousness is restored and speech is possible, the residual hemiplegia should be treated with products that nourish and activate the blood for long-term use to open the tendons and relax the collaterals, slowly working towards recovery.

"Warning signs and prevention": If there are symptoms such as numbness in the fingers, a feeling of ants crawling on the skin, unclear speech, ringing in the ears, head distension and dizziness, red eyes, or abnormal mental state, one should be careful of the sudden onset of stroke-like conditions. For prevention, one can regularly take kelp, kombu, and celery to alleviate arteriosclerosis (Foci Pharmaceutical Factory's Kelp Crystals are convenient and easy to take).

"True stroke" is a disease where one is suddenly struck by a strong wind, falls unconscious, and dies suddenly. There is no such disease in the south, so it will be briefly omitted.

### Hemiplegia

— Ruan Xinmin

Hemiplegia is a relatively common abstract term, describing that half of the body, either left or right, cannot move. Medical books define it as hemiplegia, distinguishing between two types: internal wind and external wind. Internal wind is the stroke commonly seen today (see separate article). External wind is mostly caused by women with frequent childbirth and blood deficiency, or obesity and excessive dampness. The former, "internal wind," necessarily involves a crooked mouth and eyes, and slurred speech. The latter, "external wind," is when blood deficiency and wind-dampness enter the collaterals, and the flow of Qi and blood is obstructed, so it gradually arises, solely affecting the meridians and joints, slowly making the hands and feet inconvenient to move. Although the causes of external and internal wind are different, and their onset is different, the consequences are equal, as the meridians and nerves are unfavorable. Those suffering from this disease, in addition to losing autonomy of movement, do not have much change in internal organs and the stomach, so they can eat as usual, and with proper care, they can live long with the disease. When its early stages are felt with vertigo ("high blood pressure") and soreness at the time of insistence, applying gold needle treatment, internally taking potions that calm the liver, subdue Yang, soothe the muscles, and activate the collaterals, can often moisten the dead muscles and revive them, returning to a withered state to flourish. What is hemiplegia to be afraid of? Once it becomes a reality, the root of the disease is deep, and the blood vessels and nerves are hardened, losing their working efficiency. Although there is the wonderful art of gold needles and symptomatic medicines, it will not work without long-term treatment.

### From Menstruation to Childbirth

— Shen Zhongli

A woman's menstrual blood comes once a month, which is normal. There are exceptions, such as once every two months, called combined months, once every three months, called residence months, once a year, called avoiding years, and never in a lifetime, called dark menstruation. All these kinds of things, although they are different from the ordinary, are not diseases, and they still have the ability to conceive.

The female reproductive function is entirely in the eggs discharged by the ovaries. If the ovarian function is incomplete, or the ovaries atrophy, and cannot discharge eggs, even if there is menstruation, they cannot reproduce. That is to say, although menstruation comes on time, there is menstrual abdominal pain, back pain, dizziness, unclean leucorrhea, or a naturally obese body, hindering the passage of the egg, so it cannot be conceived. Ancient books record that there are five types of infertility, called snail, pattern, drum, horn, and pulse, which are the abnormalities of the uterus in modern people. The reason is the acquired fracture, resulting in the unsoundness of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Even if pregnancy occurs, it can even form a hydatidiform mole, ectopic pregnancy, and other dangers. Furthermore, there are countless people who cannot reproduce for life due to venereal diseases.

Once menstruation is found to be pathological, reproduction is bound to be hindered. Therefore, if you want to have children, you must first adjust menstruation, use medicine according to the constitution and reality, and you can succeed. There are three effective prescriptions in the book, such as for those who cannot reproduce due to irregular menstruation, take Yimu Shengjin Dan (rehmannia, angelica, white peony, chuanxiong, salvia, motherwort, cyperus, atractylodes, motherwort). For those with uterine cold and weakness (that is, the acquired decline in the function of the uterus and fallopian tubes), take Zhongzi Pills (angelica, cistanche, lotus, eucommia, cuscuta, epimedium, tongsha yuan, yunling, psoralea, achyranthes, lycium, cinnamon, aconite, fish maws). For those with obese bodies and fatty membranes (that is, incomplete ovarian development and excessive secretion of acidic vaginal fluid), use Siwu Tang combined with Cangfu Yin Liushen Tang (angelica, chuanxiong, raw land, white peony, pinellia, tangerine red, acorus, bile star, inula, tuckahoe). Prescribe according to the symptoms, or change it to a medicinal ointment and take nine doses regularly, which is said to be the most reasonable good prescription for seeds.

### Industry and Commerce Representative Wu Yun Chu Goes to Nanjing to Request Government to Restore Loans, Attending National Economic Committee Report Today

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the issue of opening up industrial and commercial loans, the Four-Bank Joint Office previously sent letters to the National Bank Bureau to solicit opinions. It is now learned that various related opinions have been successively sent to the Four-Bank Secretariat for research, and they can be discussed at the board meeting.

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 14th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Dian Xianguang, said at the reception on the 14th that the National Bank Bureau does not intend to make any changes to the method of suspending loans in the near future. Loans that have been released in the past and have expired should continue to be collected. As for what method will be adopted in the future to use various funds to support industry and commerce, the method is still under study, and there is currently no concrete decision.

Chairman of the National Industrial Association, Wu Yunchu, went to Nanjing by car last night to represent the industrial community in requesting the authorities to restore loans to adjust funds, develop industry, and increase production. It is reported that Mr. Wu brought with him to Nanjing concrete opinions from the industrial community on opening up loans, and will attend today's National Economic Committee regular meeting in Beijing to report. It is also learned that the Four-Bank Joint Office is scheduled to hold a board meeting within the next few days to conduct research.

Since the government stopped industrial loans and inward remittance for goods, the industrial community has been feeling increasingly difficult due to insufficient working capital, and has been requesting relief. The National Industrial Association has submitted a request to the government to quickly open up conditionally. The government believes that the past industrial goods methods were not appropriate and requires the industrial community itself to propose methods for the主管authorities to study. It is now learned that the association has combined various opinions and proposed the following five suggestions:

1. Loan Target: Limited to production enterprises that are necessary for people's livelihood and are in real economic distress.

2. Loan Use: Used to purchase necessary raw materials and pay wages, and cannot be transferred to other uses.

3. Loan Application Procedure: Whether each factory's loan application is truly necessary must be initially reviewed by its affiliated trade association before being submitted to the主管机构 for approval. (Because the trade association knows more about the actual situation of each factory)

4. Audit of Loan Use: The lending bank should check the use of the loan at any time to prevent hoarding and speculation.

5. Loan Collateral: Industrial products or production equipment and factory buildings are provided as collateral.

### CITIC Bureau Negotiates to Purchase Foreign Coal, A Total of 100,000 Tons Transported to Shanghai for Storage

[This Newspaper] According to municipal government news, the Kailuan Coal Mine currently has more than 700,000 tons of coal in storage, but due to transportation difficulties, it cannot supply the needs of this city. The Fuel Management Committee has contacted relevant parties, and the Municipal Economic Council has also decided to ask the Central Trust Bureau to purchase 100,000 tons of foreign coal from Canada, the Philippines, and Vladivostok and store it in Shanghai for supply at any time. The coal purchase method has been negotiated, and there is no fear of coal shortage in this city.

Coal Prices Continue to Rise

Due to the continuous decrease in supply and the extremely difficult transportation of coal stored in Kailuan, which cannot be transported out, and the supply of Taiwanese coal to the province is only 20,000 tons for export, it is currently the middle of winter, and sales from all parties are very smooth, resulting in a continuous decrease in the bottom. The market cleanliness has increased.

Yesterday, the market price of Jiaozuo lump coal was 10 million yuan per ton at the customs, reaching 11 million yuan, and bituminous lump coal was 7.15 million yuan, an increase of 20% to 40% compared with the end of the year.

### Transportation Management Committee Relaxes Restrictions, Approves Import of Raw Materials

China National Products Joint Venture Corporation and China National Products Production and Marketing Association recently requested the Transportation Management Office to not strictly restrict the import methods of raw materials for export products in order to promote agricultural product exports. The office has replied in separate letters, stating that the above-mentioned methods have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be announced in the near future. Article 2 of the methods stipulates that "If the value of imported raw materials does not exceed 40% of the export value of their finished products, or the export of their finished products has a history and is of value to promote, and has been specially approved by the Career Import and Export Management Committee, their import will be approved." According to this provision, if there are situations that meet this provision in the future implementation, the methods can be applied. However, regarding the above-mentioned situation, it is hoped that the two companies can provide specific information for future reference by the association and the Ministry of Economic Affairs when discussing the types of raw materials to which the methods apply. Article 3 of the methods stipulates that imported raw materials must be processed and manufactured before being exported, so the imported raw materials are limited to those directly required for manufacturing export products, and this principle cannot be changed. However, the association has now allocated supplementary methods, which aim to assist exporters in importing raw materials, increasing production, and transporting a portion of the increased products abroad in exchange for foreign exchange. It is reported that the Career Management Committee has scheduled to start handling application procedures within this month. Applicants must guarantee that the raw materials imported will be manufactured into finished products and can be exported in exchange for foreign exchange before they can be approved.

### "Sociology of Education"

— Yang Tongfang

By Chen Kemei, one of the Educational Talk Series

Published by World Book Company

As the author states in the "Preface": "This is a book that offers a bird's-eye view and an introduction." A bird's-eye view must be broad and high, comprehensively describing the important theories of various schools and important materials, so that readers can gain a clear understanding. As for an introduction, it must objectively narrate what readers want to know in detail and with appropriate emphasis, so as to motivate readers to learn. This work is not easy, but this "Sociology of Education" has achieved this goal in a short space.

The book is divided into ten lectures: The first lecture, The Development of Sociology of Education, describes the history of the development of this discipline. It first explains the two broad meanings proposed by Dewey: society continues through education; education proceeds through society. Then, based on recent sociological research, it discusses the establishment of scientific sociology of education. Sociology of education must study the relationship between education and society, analyze the educational missions of various social groups, and the social significance that education should emphasize. This emerging discipline (which has made rapid progress since 1908, only forty years ago) has moved from purely theoretical research to applied research.

The second lecture, The Current Status of Sociology of Education, describes the important literature of this discipline and introduces the works of Zhang Xuelou (W.E. Chancellor), F.R. Clow, R. Groves, W.R. Smith, D. Snedden, and C.C. Peters. The author also explains the two major schools of thought in sociology of education: the educational school and the sociological school, and then concludes with the new trends in the research of this discipline, which takes into account both society and education, and studies both social phenomena and educational phenomena.

The third lecture, The Scope of Sociology of Education, separately describes the items to be studied in sociology of education: collecting the principles of how human beings live in social groups; explaining the influence of various social groups on other social groups; studying the education needed by various social groups; pointing out the mission of schools to other social groups; understanding the mission of various social groups to education; and explaining the relationship between education and social sanctions, heredity, and progress. As for the scope of research, it involves sociology of education and educational psychology; sociology of education and educational philosophy; and the research of sociology of education and social education.

The fourth and fifth lectures, The Relationship between Education and Society, are divided into four aspects: the relationship between education and social organization; the relationship between education and social sanctions; the relationship between education and social heredity; and the relationship between education and social progress. Various social groups are divided into three categories according to their different forms of combination: the first category is called primary groups, such as family, playmates, and neighborhoods; the second category is called secondary groups, such as countries and international organizations; the third category is called intermediate groups, such as professional groups and academic groups. In order to enable children and young people to have a good adaptation to these social groups, the power of education should be used to seek the coordination of the relationship between individuals and social groups. The relationship between education and social sanctions can be seen in the relationship between religion and education, law and education, and public opinion and education. The relationship between education and social heredity should not be ignored. Social heredity depends on the advancement of education, because the role of education is to transmit social heritage, so that excellent culture can be passed on to future generations, and human life experience can also be preserved. Finally, the author specifically explains the creative value of education when discussing the relationship between education and social progress. "It can be seen that in order to seek social progress, whether from a biological or social point of view, education must be assisted; this is because education is the basic work and a force driving society."

The sixth lecture, Education and Social Principles, the author argues from three aspects: education and democracy, education and social efficiency, and education and cultural concepts. The central idea does not deviate from the people-oriented ideal of education. The characteristics of modern social life can be said to be democratic, that is, popular; efficient, that is, practical; and cultural, that is, civilized. To seek the expansion and progress of modern life, we must rely on the efforts of educators.

The seventh lecture, Educational Survey, applies sociological methods to educational research and implementation. There is a concise description of the historical facts related to educational surveys in the book. The important contents of the survey include: the nature of the school and educational needs; school buildings and equipment; administrative organization; teachers; staffing; curriculum; teaching; and the relationship between school and society. Educational surveys have made great contributions to educational implementation and educational academics, which can integrate administration and theory, and educational academics have also become true and practical academics, not just empty theories.

The eighth lecture, School Administration, is not a general discussion of school administration, but from a social perspective, it explains that school administration must emphasize social significance. The author divides school administration into two aspects: one can be called external school administration, that is, the general management of schools by the state and the public; the other can be called internal school administration, that is, the specialized management of schools by school staff.

The ninth lecture, Curriculum, is the main topic to be studied in sociology of education. The curriculum is the content of education, and the content of education must be based on social needs, and of course, the order of children's physical and mental development cannot be ignored. The author also explains the trends of curriculum reform based on the theory and methods of sociology of education, which is valuable research.

The tenth lecture, Teaching Methods, discusses the relationship between teaching methods and curriculum, the meaning of teaching methods and the central principles. It further elaborates on individual and group teaching methods. There is also appropriate criticism of socialized teaching. Finally, it describes the social significance of discipline, promoting the spirit of freedom and democratic thought.

Although Chen's book cannot be said to be a great academic work, in a small space, it can enable readers to have a bird's-eye view of the essence, important theories, and methods of sociology of education. After reading this book, the author feels that the study of education should not focus on psychology or sociology, but on a clear understanding of the relationship between the development of individual psychology and social phenomena. The purpose of education is to fully develop individuality (individual initiative and creativity) in the entire society, so that individuals can do their best to benefit society. To achieve this goal, the curriculum must be changed to meet social needs, so that those who are educated develop a normal and healthy "personality," and this personality is suitable for sociality. Of course, teaching methods must also follow this ideal, paying attention to the various influences of the social environment on the attitude of individual life.

### European War History

— Chu Yukun

By Tang Zichang, published by Yongxiang Printing Company, divided into eight volumes

Regarding the works on the Second World War, in the British and American publishing circles, they have been published one after another, like mushrooms after a rain; although China's publishing circles are inferior in comparison, they have made progress compared to after the First World War. I remember that after the Second World War, China's publishing circles only had Zhang Naiyan's "European War History", and this European War History was of a translated nature, not a real work. However, after the Second World War, several works and translations have been published; for example, my humble work, A History of the Second World War, focuses on diplomatic activities between countries, and does not pay much attention to the shift of war, so it is omitted and not detailed. However, after reading Mr. Tang Zichang's great work, European War History, the course of the European War is described in great detail. The whole book has 1.5 million words, divided into eight volumes: The Beginning of the European War; The Central European Theater; The Northern European Theater; The Western European Theater; The Southern European Theater; The Eastern European Theater; The European Fortress; A General Review of the European War.

Regardless of its content, in the impoverished Chinese publishing world, the publication of this great work is a commendable thing after all. At least, it can be seen that Chinese academics are independent and no longer rely on the works of foreigners. This progress is especially worthy of our cherish. Therefore, I would like to introduce it to all readers.

The first volume, The Beginning of the European War, not only clarifies the reasons for the outbreak of the Second World War: the influence of the Treaty of Versailles; the agitation of the global war; the political conflicts of the European powers; the military competition of the European powers, but also briefly describes the course of the European War, until Hitler surrendered and the European War ended. This volume can be regarded as an introduction, or as a unit with its own independence.

The second volume, The Central European Theater, focuses on the German-Polish War. It first explains the geographical situation of Central Europe, recalls the process of the merger of Germany and Austria and the disintegration of Czechoslovakia, and points out the ambition of Nazi Germany for Central Europe. It finally broke out into a European war due to the Polish problem. This is the prelude to the European War. Germany adopted a blitzkrieg strategy against Poland, and won a great victory in less than a month. General Tang Zichang, the author, is good at military strategy, and his comments on the gains and losses of the blitzkrieg strategy are very detailed.

The third volume, The Northern European Theater, completely describes the course of the Finnish War and the Norwegian War. However, the biggest feature of the book is to describe the relationship between naval warfare and the air force. In simple terms, the victory or defeat of naval warfare completely depends on the superiority or inferiority of the air force on both sides, and the strength of the navy is secondary. This is different from the First World War.

The fourth volume, The Western European Theater, focuses on the French-German War, and describes the tragedy of France in detail.

The fifth volume, The Southern European Theater, covers a wide range, from the Balkans in the north to Africa in the south, and also includes Italy and the Near East. Is it appropriate to call this theater the Southern European Theater? It remains to be discussed.

The sixth volume, The Eastern European Theater, completely describes the course of the German-Soviet War, but the strategic comments of both Germany and the Soviet Union are very detailed. In essence, Germany also adopted a blitzkrieg strategy against the Soviet Union, but it was impossible to seek a quick victory, and it fell into a mistake. The Soviet Red Army's strategy, on the one hand, was to buy time; on the other hand, it engaged in a holistic war, which eventually led to the failure of the blitzkrieg strategy of the German army.

The seventh volume, The European Fortress, starts from the air war over the European continent, and continues to talk about the opening of the second theater, the meeting of the East and West, and the fall of Berlin, which forced Germany to surrender unconditionally.

The eighth volume, A General Review of the European War, discusses weapons and science in detail, which is most worthy of the attention of people who study national defense and military affairs.

In short, General Tang Zichang's European War History is a work that focuses on the military and weapons, and can be used as a reference for military scholars. In the past, Chinese soldiers often regarded the Art of War as a must-read book, and this European War History can be used as a must-read reference book. But it also has its shortcomings, that is, it lacks a correct understanding of the nature of this war. We cannot but regard this as a shortcoming.

### "The Psychology of Children's Painting"

— Wen Zhaotong

(By Huang Mo, published by Commercial Press)

After introducing the selected translation of "Research on the Psychology of Children's Painting" in the December 4th issue of this journal, we continue to need to introduce the only special book on the psychology of children's painting by Chinese people, "The Psychology of Children's Painting". This was written by Huang Ji of Zhejiang University Training Institute around 1937. It describes the gains of his many years of research.

The most important part of this book is naturally the third unit, "The Development Process". It originally used the research of the "group method" to observe the general characteristics of children's painting. In other words, it is only the general process of the development of children's depiction psychology.

Huang Yi determined that the development process of children's painting is divided into: the scribbling stage, the symbolic stage or transitional stage, the fixed stage, and the realistic stage.

Children around the age of three to four are in the "scribbling stage". Scribbling is the forerunner of real painting. At this time, what is drawn are some meaningless strokes. At first, they are wavy, then circular, and thirdly, multi-shaped, but children get practice in controlling their arms and pens and paper from this. This kind of scribbling can be compared to the pronunciation game of language. The pronunciation game is also meaningless, repeated, and biased towards rhythmic activities, and it also has the function of preparatory practice for real language.

From the "scribbling stage" to the real painting, it is necessary to go through a "symbolic stage or transitional stage". The paintings in this period are still similar to scribbling, but it can already be explained what things are painted; or first declare what things are to be painted, and then start writing. Children's paintings around the age of five to six can be said to have such a tendency completely.

The golden age of children's painting is around the age of seven to ten. Children are very happy to express themselves freely and create freely. However, the images they depict are not completely correct. It is precisely the lack of the elements of the correctness of the image that uniquely expresses the childish, primitive, simple, and rustic fun of children's books.

For these reasons, the author also collected research data and results from various Chinese and foreign families in this stage, and spent about a quarter of the book to conduct meticulous research and description. First, he studied the evolution of children's drawing of people, and determined that it evolved from tadpole people, gradually complete frontal people, side people, and actions. He also studied examples of beasts, houses, trees, flowers, imitation paintings, etc., and analyzed the characteristics of children's paintings in this period as follows:

Obviously it is not a careful description, but only a kind of simple sketch and design drawing, and regardless of the individual differences of the real object, it is only a rigid, fixed, and拘執模型

The part of the depicted object is often incomplete, and it is extremely subjective to take away.

A fault that seems to be the opposite of omitting important parts is to describe some things that are not seen. The so-called transparent description of children's painting refers to this feature.

A strange mistake that moves a part of one object to another object.

The ratio does not match the actual state.

Due to mechanized automation, the same description will often be made continuously. For example, there will be a few more fingers when describing fingers.

The spatial configuration and organization relationship of objects are incorrect.

The orientation of objects is incorrect, such as inversion and skew.

The two-dimensional depiction of objects.

The transfer of the object's point of view. For example, it should be a side view, but it is still drawn as a front view.

The object's unreasonable distance and size.

Young children cannot imitate paintings or sketch. Although he puts the real object or book in front of him, when painting, he still paints in the way of free painting, and the results are no better than free painting.

As for why children's paintings have these characteristics? According to the "functional psychology" scholars, it is due to "lack of ability"; another is the saying of "evolution", which is very similar to the evolution of biological forms. Therefore, the psychology of children's painting has been　determined to have a principle that has been recognized throughout the ages: "Children draw what they know, not what they see." I don't know if it is the golden rule.

The author observes that the objects depicted by children all have a tendency to succeed in a simple, neat, and fixed stereotype, according to the "best completion law" (Law of Pragnanz) of Gestalt psychology and physics. Especially circles and ellipses, as long as they can be slightly pulled together, they are used everywhere, because this is the simplest and most complete shape. This is also due to the research in "perceptual fixation". It can be said: Children's painting is not due to "the author put this recognized principle, is based on his abstract knowledge, but based on what he directly saw in a natural attitude. The painter's painting is based on what he saw with a special view; the painter's view needs learning, knowledge and training. It is only possible." The errors in children's painting are indeed natural expressions, and those who teach children's art should pay special attention to them.

After the "fixed stage", it is the "realistic stage". Around the age of ten, children begin to acquire a realistic vision, and see all kinds of unsatisfactory places in their works, and begin to feel the technical problems. After this, there are two different development trends: The first is children with talent and the opportunity to receive good training, they continue to develop and reach the realistic realm of art, they learn to observe things with the eyes of a painter, analyze the actual state of light projection under various points of view, correctly express the sense of three-dimensionality and distance, and obtain the coordination of composition and the special artistic conception and taste of beauty. But most children are a sad encounter: they are ambitious but incompetent, discouraged, and the naive self-confidence of the previous period gradually disappears. Under this kind of training, it is not enough to make up for the lack of talent. Under this self-consciousness, hesitation, and restraint, they automatically give up this game. They often want to apologize for their incompetence when describing daytime. So the technology will no longer progress, and most adults' artistic accomplishments in life have never exceeded the higher fixed stage or the initial realistic stage. The stagnation of social art and culture may also be an indirect reason here. Therefore, children's art teachers must also make another plan for children's art education after the age of ten.

This book also describes the "research methods" on the psychology of children's daytime painting, as well as "individual differences and graphic tests", "gender differences", "pictures of children of various ethnic groups", "various aspects of children's pictures and children's psychology", "comparison between children's painting and primitive ethnic painting", "educational conclusions" and other chapters, which have unique insights. However, if the third chapter can be thoroughly understood, these many will become technical questions.

### "Miss Antie"

— Wei Sha

Written by Ms. Tao Bing, published by China Books and Magazines Company

We love literature and art because they reflect life and beautify the human heart that is immersed in the mundane world. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in today's publishing world where paper is as valuable as gold, only old works are being resold. Moreover, the unstable lives of writers have led to a scarcity of new literary creations.

Therefore, "Gone with the Wind" and "Amber" have gained a large readership in China. Of course, the success of Ms. Margaret Mitchell and Ms. Vanessa is not accidental. Their stories are moving, and their writing is elegant and beautiful. They are not just novels; they are also portrayals of an era of history. Their best-selling status in England and America allows their people to remember the pioneering and striving spirit of their ancestors.

We cannot always look to "Dream of the Red Chamber" to escape reality. We can only use translated novels to satisfy our thirst for knowledge and our parched souls. Because of the narrowness of their lives, Chinese female writers cannot leave the city, so there is a lack of vast creations. In the ten years from the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War to the present, we have only seen one book, "Silent Songstress," by Ms. Fengzi.

I am delighted to introduce to friends who love literature, the creation novel "Miss Antie," published on New Year's Day this year, which has 140,000 words. It made me finish reading it with tears in the warm sunshine. Antie is a husband among women, a hero among female students, a holy, chaste, and extraordinary woman in love, a spokesperson for professional women enduring suffering and appealing to society, and a lyrical cry of the heart for dancers who have been devastated. The stories are intimate and true, the characters are vivid and full of flesh and blood, and the writing style is simple, fluent, and timeless. It is a realistic creation that shocked the literary world. We cheer for this new writer, and we hope that she will work harder to produce a deeper exploration of the tragedy of life and the lonely struggle of suffering women, with delicate descriptions.

"Miss Antie" is heart-wrenching. Raised by her weak and elderly grandmother and nurtured by her widowed mother in poverty, Antie used her intelligence and outstanding academic achievements to win the awards of wise teachers. Under the wings of grace, Antie enriched her knowledge. In an environment where her family was too poor to finish elementary school, she miraculously grasped the first place in the exam for five or six years and completed her high school studies for free. In this bitter childhood growing-up period, her extraordinary victory brought joy to her grandmother in her remaining years, and at the same time, the hopes of the Luo family were pinned on her. Antie knew that her task was to take the place of her deceased father to obtain work and support her mother and younger siblings.

Brought up under the old ethics, she suffered her first love challenge. Her grandmother forced her to give herself to the hypocritical businessman Yang Zhenya, a deceiver who disguised himself as loving, because he used a little money to rescue Antie's family from starvation. However, after he obtained the pure and innocent Antie, satisfied his animal desires, he kicked away the three generations of the Luo family, causing the death of the old Mrs. Luo, breaking Antie's heart, and forcing her to face the cruel reality of life, making her independent personality to survive in the world and her upward will to strive for equal status between men and women even stronger. She is a filial daughter, willing to endure the destruction of her soul, severing her love for her beloved teacher. She bravely sacrificed her beautiful ideals and happiness. Precisely because she was like this, old Mrs. Luo could not close her eyes at her deathbed, repenting and hating the sinister nature of people's hearts, and cherishing the tender grass she had cultivated after being soaked in storms. In her dying moments, she was reluctant to leave the cold world, hoping to return to the garden of her hometown, relive the wounded land, and once again enjoy a warm and peaceful family life. This symbolizes the destruction of the old family and the death of the old ethics. Finally, old Mrs. Luo took her thoughts into the earth. Antie flies like a petrel across the ocean, her long-term fighting spirit was destroyed by the magical hands of a fake female staff member. She retreated on the rugged path of life. In an unreasonable society, a woman with real talent and learning could not obtain a job that could feed her family. Carrying her child after divorce, a small life abandoned at birth, she encountered cold looks everywhere, without the means of socializing, a woman who valued her pure soul had difficulty finding even a position as an elementary school teacher. With her young child crying for food, her mother and younger brother struggling in hunger and cold, Antie's wavering heart and trembling will were shaken. On the advice of a friend with the same fate, she joined the dance floor as a dance partner. She painfully dedicated her youth and beauty, but she still maintained an eternal love for her first lover, Qin Xuan. This bitter medicine of life, the bitter fruit of love, she swallowed with sorrow. Finally, after she was humiliated and harmed, after her child, whom she had cultivated with tears and loneliness, died prematurely, after her mother left the tragic world and her younger brother traveled far away, and even after her lover died in a plane crash, she ended her remaining life, throwing herself into the vast river, like a lotus flower emerging from the mud and returning to the soil. The story full of human touch made me cry.

### The Leftovers of Mice

— He Ku

There are mice in the office, but I have never seen them, because mice will never come out during the day. But how do I know there is a serious rat infestation in the office? That is clear at a glance every morning when I open the drawer with the key. The drawer is full of orange peels, fruit pits, paper scraps, and even urine stains. Before sitting down to work every day, I must first clean up the leftovers left by the mice that came out last night. They are returning after enjoying themselves, but the cleaning work is done by us, the most intelligent of all things, on their behalf.

These days are approaching the end of the lunar year. Folk legends say that there are programs such as mice getting married at this time. Perhaps the busyness of the mice these nights is equivalent to humans marrying off their daughters-in-law, so the feast in the evening is also an inherent part of the theme. Thinking of this, I feel calm and peaceful when I clear the leftovers for the mice.

However, what attracts my attention is the issue of the mice's food. It is rare to have oranges or fruit pits in the office, and as for bread crumbs, they are extremely rare. To regularly maintain the survival of the mice, where does this food come from?

Later, one day I finally discovered that a small brush band on a pair of paste jars suddenly disappeared. After searching, I finally found it in a corner of the drawer among the pile of paper scraps and carnage! To lick the paste on the band, the mice even scavenged the short bristles on the brush band. And the paste we put on the table, a small half is used up, and a large half is supplied to the mice as regular food. This paste is delivered every two days by a company called "Hygienic Monthly Paste Company." Only now do I know the meaning of the naming. It turns out that "hygienic" means protecting the lives of mice.

Do not underestimate a small mouse. Even if there are mousetraps and ambushes everywhere, they still find ways to find something to eat in hardship to maintain their lives. They never ask others for advice. They only know how to rely on their own efforts. In human society, a certain type of parasitic people should feel ashamed.

Talking About Diamonds — Mao Yi

India is the earliest source of diamonds. The diamonds produced in the gravel layers in India evolved from ancient alluvial layers, and these alluvial layers evolved from materials from the mountains of the Archean period billions of years ago.

These diamonds, crystallized from carbon elements, were later excavated by people in riverbeds and on riverbanks, and sometimes found in dried-up ancient riverbeds. The ancient Indian "diamond panning" technique can still be seen in Ceylon today—they dig shallow pits in the gravel of the mining area, sieve the excavated gravel with bamboo sieves, and then wash it with water. If they are lucky, they can obtain valuable crystalline products.

Before the 18th century, the Indian diamond industry monopolized the world market. However, since diamonds were discovered again in Brazil in 1725, the eastern diamond industry began to decline. Like India, Brazil's diamonds are also stored in ancient gravel layers. Brazilian mines have increased the world's diamond supply by a considerable amount, but their output pales in comparison to that of the later discovered African mines. It is estimated that before eighty years ago, the total number of diamonds larger than thirty carats unearthed worldwide would not exceed one hundred.

The first diamond discovered in South Africa was picked up in 1867 by children of several Dutch immigrants on the banks of the Orange River; the remaining diamonds were discovered the following year at the confluence of the Vaal and Orange Rivers. When a Hottentot tribesman picked up a large diamond of eighty-three and a half carats in 1869, the "diamond rush" began. The tents of the diamond diggers lined the river. Later, diamonds were also found far from the rivers, and these places were called "dry mines," which were originally dried-up ancient riverbeds.

The surface layer of the dry mining area is a layer of loess. However, digging down from the loess layer to a depth of fifty to sixty feet reveals a layer of blue earth, which is where the diamonds are hidden. After washing, they reappear in the world.

In addition to the mining areas formed by ancient riverbeds, South Africa also has olivine rock deposits formed by volcanic eruptions, which are also a source of diamonds. The world's largest olivine rock deposit is the "Premier Mine" near Pretoria. Its thickest diameter exceeds half a mile, covering seventy-eight acres of land, and has been excavated to a depth of nearly seven hundred feet. The world's largest diamond, the "Cullinan," was discovered here in 1905. This huge diamond weighed three thousand and twenty-five carats (or one and one-third pounds). If valued in legal currency, I am afraid that astronomical figures would be overshadowed.

### Indifference

— Qin Wen

With stimulation, there must be a reaction. From a psychological point of view, humans can make appropriate responses to environmental stimuli through perception. However, after a considerable period of time, they become accustomed to this stimulus and take it for granted. There must be newer changes to produce new reactions. "Habit becomes nature" is a proverb, but it is a correct law that conforms to psychological theory.

So when Grandma Liu entered the Grand View Garden, an old woman from a small, poor village family was suddenly taken to the luxurious and extravagant mansion of the rich and powerful. What she saw and heard, of course, made her feel at a loss and embarrassed. This is because of the sudden difference in the entire way of life. Therefore, based on this stimulus, the reactions generated, in addition to being stunned, are either admiration or disgust and discomfort. But as long as she lives there for half a year or three months, everything will become commonplace. "The strange is no longer strange, and the strange will defeat itself." The peep show has been revealed, so it is no longer surprising. Of course, we do not agree with the mechanistic view that environment determines everything, but we cannot deny the great influence of the environment on the individual's body and mind. "Entering a room of orchids, one does not smell the fragrance for a long time; entering a stall of abalone, one does not smell the stench for a long time." The reason why Mencius' mother chose her neighbors three times was to prevent her son from being confused by the environment and learning some good examples.

From a strict and unyielding attitude towards life, to indulging in corruption, at first one is always unwilling to go with the flow, feeling it is difficult to be compatible. Over time, one becomes indifferent and merges with the darkness, without any sense of propriety, justice, integrity, or shame. Fallen people always go from being incompatible to being indifferent, from "being at odds" to "being in cahoots." Therefore, the "being at odds" stage is often the turning point for attitude changes. Once one reaches the stage of "indifference," it is very difficult to recover. People with numb nerves cannot muster any energy. For example, a pool of stagnant water, occasionally stirred by a pebble, quickly returns to its original state, and can no longer cause any waves.

"A sense of compassion, everyone has it." Humans are originally animals full of compassion. But if one encounters beggars all day long, one becomes indifferent to beggars. If one hears the sound of cannons and guns all year round, one becomes indifferent to war. If one sees refugees and thieves every day, one becomes indifferent to people freezing to death and committing suicide. When one cannot bear to sympathize, one loses sympathy. Will the world one day be like ice, with cold everywhere?

### Emperor Gaozong of Song and Zhang Jun

— Zheng Guoyi

Zhang Jun was the most prominent among the famous generals of the Southern Song Dynasty, known as Zhang (Jun), Han (Shizhong), Liu (Qi), and Yue (Fei). However, because he failed to maintain his integrity in his later years, pandered to Qin Hui's wishes, supported the peace talks, and was jealous of Liu Qi and Yue Fei's success, his statue is still being spat upon by the West Lake to this day. This is all due to a moment's error in his pursuit of fame, fortune, and wealth.

However, Zhang Jun, apart from this, also had the merit of defending the country with his "Iron Mountain Army." The "History of the Southern Song Dynasty" says, "Zhang Jun had a majestic appearance and a natural seriousness. His military discipline was strict during expeditions and garrison duties. He could win the support of those who surrendered or were captured." "Linquan Yexi" says, "Jun cherished his soldiers, his rewards and punishments were clear and credible, and he planned before fighting, so he never lost." Those who praised him even went so far as to say that he was even better. Therefore, I deeply regret Zhang Jun's failure to uphold his original aspirations. The reason why Zhang Jun did this was probably to discern Emperor Gaozong's intentions. Observing that Gaozong was determined to kill Yue Fei and disliked Han Shizhong, and that after Jun's death, the imperial court's condolences were extraordinary and praised him without reservation, his intentions are clear. The "Chronicle of Events Since the Jianyan Era" records: "On Gui Chou day in the seventh month of autumn in the twenty-fourth year of Shaoxing, Zhang Jun, the Grand Tutor, Duke of Qinghe, Pacifying Minister of Jingjiang, and Commander of the Jinghai Army, died in the imperial court at the age of sixty-nine. The next day, the ministers presented the report. The Emperor said: 'Zhang Jun died suddenly. The envoy Zhang Tonggu came, and his efforts were extremely appropriate. He is different from Han Shizhong and others. The amount of grace should be generous.' He then bestowed a sable crown and court dress for the burial, and ordered the inner servant Zhang Qu to handle the funeral affairs. Jun advocated peace talks in his later years and agreed with Qin Hui's intentions. The Emperor treated him generously." It also said: "On Bing Wu day in the eighth month, the Ministry of Rites drafted the posthumous honors for Zhang Jun, requesting that they follow the example of Han Shizhong. Previously, the Emperor commented on Qin Hui, saying: 'No military official is like Zhang Jun, who is ten thousand times better than Han Shizhong. The posthumous honors should be reviewed by the relevant officials and should be as generous as possible according to past practices.' When it was presented, the Emperor said: 'When he was in Mingshou, Jun had 8,000 soldiers stationed in Wujiang. Zhu Shengfei issued a decree to send him to Qin Prefecture, but Jun refused. He advanced his troops and defeated the bandits, which was truly meritorious. He can be granted the title of Wang with one character, and the Ministry of Rites should draft the decree.' Therefore, he was specially named the Prince of Zhen. Since the posthumous conferment of the Prince of Zhen, no one with a different surname has been conferred the title of Prince of Zhen. It all started with Jun. He was buried in Wuxi County, and the generals and prefects who paid tribute were numerous. Jiangzuo considered it an honor." Zhang Jun's posthumous favors were so great. The Zhang Tonggu mentioned above was the envoy from the Jin Dynasty who came to negotiate peace. And the so-called "advancing troops to defeat the bandits in Mingshou" refers to Emperor Gaozong's restoration. When Gaozong was deposed and imprisoned by Miao Fu and Liu Zhengyan in Mingshou, his restoration was mostly due to the merits of Zhang Jun and Han Shizhong. Han Shizhong even captured Miao and Liu alive and presented them as prisoners to the court. How can Zhang Jun, who was attached to Han Shizhong, be regarded as insignificant? Yet he said that he was "ten thousand times better than Han Shizhong." What does this mean? His intention was clearly focused on Zhang Tonggu's coming to negotiate peace, not on the restoration of Mingshou. Han Shizhong's loyalty, bravery, and integrity were the same as Yue Fei's, and he remained stubborn and did not agree to the peace talks, which was also the same as Yue Fei's. However, the reason why Shizhong did not die while Fei did was that Shizhong's merits were higher than Yue Fei's, and his rank was also higher. Gaozong and Qin Hui had no excuse to attack him. Killing Fei was precisely to make Shizhong fearful. Zhu Wen Gong (Xi) said: "Fei died, and then Han Shizhong was defeated." This one sentence fully expresses the reality of that day. Emperor Gaozong was most afraid of Han Shizhong and Yue Fei among the generals. Fei's crudeness was even more pronounced than Shizhong's, so Fei was finally executed, and Shizhong was almost spared. Gaozong feared the Jin people like tigers externally and feared that the generals would not obey his orders internally, fearing that he would not be able to sit in his position for a day. Zhang Jun had known this for a long time, and his monarch and minister had understood each other's hearts for a long time. Therefore, he realized that the court wanted to dismiss the generals to the extreme, so he first requested to hand over his troops. When the Jin Dynasty again captured Chusi and Yangzhou, Jun never sent troops across the river to solidify the peace talks, all of which deeply conformed to Emperor Gaozong's intentions. Gaozong treated Shizhong with excessive indulgence and regarded him as the most favored among the generals. The edicts to Yue Fei were also full of warm words. His words to Zhang Jun were often full of reprimands and warnings. But in the end, after Fei was convicted, he also had derogatory remarks about Shizhong. And when Jun died, his praises were so beautiful that it is clear that Gaozong's generous treatment of Shizhong and his comforting of Yue Fei were out of deep fear of their future coercion, and his criticism of Jun alone was because he regarded him as a confidant. How dare Jun not advocate peace talks and frame Yue Fei, to plan for his family's future? Therefore, I say that Jun's crime was actually caused by Gaozong. Without Jun, Fei would have died anyway. This is the root of the argument. However, is it also unjust that he knelt before Yue Fei's tomb for a long time, leaving a bad name for thousands of years?

### Suggestions to the Post Office

— Mang

The increase in postal rates caused a storm in the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. Now the price increase is no longer a problem, but whether it can maintain the original price in the future is still a question because prices are rising too fast!

Why do postal rates have to rise? The reason is of course because of the large expenses. According to the General Post Office, printing many stamps alone costs a lot of money. Adding in the large expenses, it is certainly not enough to cover the costs, so we have to resort to raising prices. However, the continuous price increases of state-owned enterprises have at least had some impact on prices.

Can we call for no increase in postal rates? This is impossible. So, what better way is there to solve this problem? I think: the American method is worth imitating, that is, to combine envelopes, stationery, and stamps into one, and have the post office print and sell a special envelope. The inside of the envelope serves as stationery, and the envelope is printed with stamps. The sender only needs to write, fold it up, and glue it together. In this way, the procedures and wages for printing beautiful stamps are enough to print the entire letter of envelope, stationery, and stamps together.

Adopting this method seems to have many conveniences:

Convenience for the Post Office—The Post Office has already created standard envelopes and standard stationery. Now it has to print many stamps, which is not only cumbersome, but also costs a lot of money. Printing the new three-in-one envelopes and stationery can save a lot of expenses. Moreover, the uniform format and size are of great convenience to postal workers, and it can also save a lot of paper consumption.

Convenience for Senders—Senders only need to purchase this letter set from the post office, and they no longer need to buy stationery and stamps, which can avoid many trivial troubles.

Since there are so many conveniences, why doesn't the post office try it out? I dare to offer this to the postal authorities.

### Burma (Part 1)

— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion

Burma declared independence at the beginning of this year (January 4, 1948). Major countries in Europe, Asia, and America have sent congratulations and best wishes. This is also a major event in the new era.

The largest country on the Asian continent is only China. To its east are Korea, Japan, and Ryukyu, to its northwest are the Mongolian and Tibetan regions, and to its southwest are India, Burma, and Vietnam, like satellites. The Qing Dynasty repeatedly used troops in the northwest and southwest, especially in the sixty years of Qianlong, which was known as the "Ten Complete Military Campaigns," and reducing Burma was one of the ten achievements. The northwest showed significant achievements in expanding territory, while the southwest, a smoky and swampy area in the tropics, was never actually conquered. In the eighteenth year of Qianlong, the two local chieftains on the border attacked each other, and the Burmese intervened, taking the opportunity to invade internally, which led to the disputes between the Qing and Burma. Governor Liu Zao committed suicide because the matter was thorny, and Grand Secretary Yang Ying was killed for mishandling the situation. General Mingrui led his troops to attack and died in battle along with the great general Guan Yinbao. Qianlong was angry and indignant and issued a decree saying: These desolate borders are not worth using troops, but now that we have started, we cannot stop. So he appointed the imperial relative Grand Secretary Fu Heng as the strategist and Minister Agui led fierce generals and heavy troops on a major southern expedition. Before leaving, he secretly instructed that he only needed to win one or two battles to save the face of the Celestial Dynasty and then return to the capital. Fu Heng and other large troops set out from Beijing, mighty and unstoppable, first announcing their intentions, and then launching a sharp attack. As expected, they won several battles in a row. The Burmese king was afraid and asked for peace, and the Qing people also took this opportunity to end the war, making Burma a "tributary state." (Tributary states only paid tribute on time and offered congratulatory tables and gifts, completing the ceremony of a small country to the "Celestial Dynasty." Like Korea, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam, they were completely autonomous in their internal affairs. The routine court visits and tribute matters were handled by the "Ministry of Rites." This was different from the northwestern Mongolian and Tibetan regions, where imperial envoys were stationed and managed by the "Ministry of Dependencies.")

In 1885, due to the treaty signed after the Sino-French War, France annexed Vietnam (Annam). The following year, Britain annexed Burma, like a piece of music being played in succession. Thailand, on the other hand, maintained its autonomy by being squeezed by the two powers. The southwestern border of China was completely dismantled. This was the event of the eleventh or twelfth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty.

After Burma belonged to Britain, it was connected to India and was simply called Burma, which was part of India on British maps (Governed as a part of British India). For sixty years, although under foreign rule, it still maintained its culture and customs. Because of its abundant resources, life was quite comfortable. Now it has declared independence and restored its political power. However, after examining Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Anglo-Burmese Agreement regarding British debt and British commerce, and Article 4 regarding national defense, it is just as Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu said, "True independence must be achieved after the economic problems are solved. First, we must unite internally, endure a hundred times the hardship, and embark on the long road of construction. Otherwise, military, political, and economic opportunities will indirectly give others the chance to control us." This is indeed a wise and insightful statement. During the Anti-Japanese War, China sent a large army into Burma to help destroy the enemy. We are friends in need. Therefore, we know that this independence, from the head of state downwards, sending sincere congratulatory messages is definitely not a mere formality, but has a deep and meaningful significance.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (42)

Zhu Zhai deeply understood Yunqing's feelings. Outwardly cold but inwardly warm, when you were unhappy, she would carefully comfort and console you. When you were happily cheerful, she would give you a soft rebuke, making you both cry and laugh. Thus, he furrowed his brow, shook his head, and said, "There's nothing to say. I'd rather become a wandering monk than live in such a family." Yunqing said, "Are you arguing with your wife again? You've only been married for a few months. How can you argue with your wife every day?" Zhu Zhai said, "There's no reasoning with such a person. She's meticulous about trivial matters but careless about important ones. Her vision is too short-sighted, and her actions are despicable. If she continues like this, all my friends will be offended!" Yunqing said, "What exactly happened?" Zhu Zhai said, "There's nothing to say. From today on, I won't go home anymore. Let her do whatever she wants!" Yunqing said, "You should explain clearly what happened that makes you hate her so much." Zhu Zhai said, "Her crimes are countless." Yunqing said, "It can't be that bad! Sometimes her mind isn't clear, but she's loyal and honest. You should forgive her for everything!" Zhu Zhai said, "Since our marriage, I've been forgiving her every day. Now, I can't bear it anymore. I must divorce her!" Yunqing said, "You keep talking about divorce. Will the family allow such a thing?" Zhu Zhai said, "The mental stimulation I've suffered is too great. If this continues, I'll go crazy! I don't care if the family allows it or not. Even if I can't formally divorce her, I'll divorce her informally. I'll never go home, and she can sit on the sidelines for the rest of her life!" Yunqing said, "Your approach is too ruthless." Zhu Zhai said, "The environment has forced me to do this. If she's smart, she'll propose a divorce herself. I can give her a considerable alimony. Otherwise, I'll just leave her aside and let her suffer." Yunqing said, "If she doesn't agree to a formal divorce, you can never remarry!" Zhu Zhai said, "Legally, if I remarry while she's not divorced, it's a crime of bigamy. But outside the law, there are ways. Besides, if my goal isn't achieved, I won't remarry for the rest of my life, and that's okay!" Yunqing was very moved when she heard the phrase "if my goal isn't achieved." She thought to herself that his intentions hadn't changed. If he could divorce his wife, the second step would naturally be to repeat his previous words, pursuing me and achieving his original goal. If he hasn't forgotten his feelings, how could I have forgotten my original aspirations! I've always endured the pain in my heart, and for the sake of appearances, I didn't dare to show any emotion. Now that he has this intention, I should not only not oppose it but also support him. With these thoughts running through her mind, Yunqing lowered her eyes, bit her lip, and silently twisted her handkerchief.

Reader Consultation Legal Clarification

### Three-Year House Rental Agreement; Thug Refuses to Pay Rent

A reader, Mr. Jia, has a house rented to Mr. Yi, stipulating a three-year term, expiring at the end of February next year. However, Mr. Yi is a local thug and has refused to pay rent since January of this year. Questions: Can the original contract be terminated, and Mr. Yi be compelled to move out due to his refusal to pay rent before the end of the term? If Mr. Yi refuses to fulfill the contract after the expiration date, what measures can be taken to make him move out? If Mr. Jia does not use the house himself after the expiration date, does Mr. Yi have the right to renew the lease? Can Mr. Jia refuse to renew the lease due to Mr. Yi's refusal to pay rent during the lease term and rent it to a third party?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] If the lessee fails to pay the rent on the agreed date, and the lessor urges payment but the lessee still fails to pay the accumulated rent (excluding the security deposit), for more than two months, the contract may be terminated, and the house may be recovered (see Article 440 of the Civil Code and Article 100, Paragraph 3 of the Land Act). First apply for mediation by the court. If mediation fails, file a lawsuit according to law. If the lessee does not constitute grounds for termination of the contract at the end of the term, he still has the right to continue the lease. The law does not restrict Mr. Jia from not renewing the lease due to the lessee's breach of contract and failure to pay rent, nor from renting it to anyone else.
