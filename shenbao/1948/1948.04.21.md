### National Assembly Proposals All Reviewed; Submitted for Discussion at Today's General Meeting; Vice Presidential Candidates Officially Announced

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The National Assembly Presidium held its 24th meeting at 8 PM on the 20th. Chairman Liu Zhi presided and resolved that a general meeting would be held both in the morning and afternoon of the 21st to discuss the review reports of proposals from various groups. Xue Yue and Shen Huilian were designated to serve as chairmen of the morning and afternoon general meetings, respectively.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] In addition to the public announcement of vice-presidential candidates, the National Assembly held group review meetings throughout the 20th. All 858 proposals were reviewed at the highest speed, except for the approximately 150 proposals reviewed on the 16th and 17th. Review opinions were submitted, and it was decided that the general meeting would begin discussing them on the 21st.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The vice-presidential candidates, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, Mo Dehui, and Xu Chuanlin, were publicly announced at 9 AM on the 20th in front of the National Assembly Hall. The number of signatories supporting each candidate was: Sun Ke, 540; Yu Youren, 512; Li Zongren, 479; Cheng Qian, 338; Mo Dehui, 211; and Xu Chuanlin, 232.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The principle question of establishing a permanent organization after the National Assembly adjourns has been reviewed and passed by the Review Committee and submitted for discussion at the general meeting on the 21st. During the review meeting on the 20th, the name, organization, and responsibilities of the organization were discussed in detail. Among the 20 related proposals, the majority, based on the provisions of Article 7 of the National Assembly Organization Law regarding the establishment of special committees, believed that a body similar in nature to a standing committee should be established during the adjournment to continue its responsibilities. During today's review meeting, many representatives expressed their opinions on this issue. The final review opinion that was passed decided to establish two special committees. The full text of the review opinion is as follows: "After the adjournment of this Assembly, in order to examine constitutional governance and discuss the Constitution in preparation for the discussion and amendment of the Constitution at the extraordinary session, it seems necessary to establish a Constitutional Governance Examination Committee and a Constitutional Research Committee, with the participation of all representatives. Detailed organizational methods should be proposed to the General Assembly by the Presidium for decision." During the discussion, there were concerns that the establishment of this organization would follow the path of the Committee for the Promotion of Constitutional Implementation, achieving nothing and wasting public funds. Therefore, the majority of people expressed the opinion that the composition of the two committees must be prudent, and they must be unpaid positions, doing serious work and serious research, so that the issue of constitutional amendment at the extraordinary session in two years will not be dealt with hastily.

### First Review Committee Suggests Adding a Permanent Organization During the National Assembly Adjournment; Approves Proposal for Reforming Politics and Severely Punishing Corruption

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The First Review Committee held a meeting at the Assembly Hall at 9:40 AM on the 20th. 357 representatives attended. Chairman Lin Zigui announced the opening of the meeting and first explained that the review committee should review a total of 163 proposals, which were divided into six categories based on their nature: (1) those related to the National Assembly itself, totaling 24; (2) those related to the Constitution, totaling 10; (3) those related to administration, totaling 59; (4) those related to judicial examinations, totaling 11; (5) those related to local autonomy, totaling 20; (6) others not belonging to the above categories, totaling 39. Because there were too many cases, discussion of each case individually would be impossible. Therefore, the convener's meeting decided to adopt categorized discussion. Afterwards, (1) the conveners explained, (2) the committee members expressed their opinions, (3) the conveners summarized the opinions and submitted them to the General Assembly for discussion. Then, each convener began to explain: Zhang Zhiben explained the proposals related to the constitutional section. Zhang said: Analyzing them, there are five categories totaling ten cases: those related to the next Assembly session, those related to constitutional amendment, those related to temporary provisions, etc. Fu Boping explained the National Assembly and general administrative sections. Those related to the National Assembly were roughly divided into amending the National Assembly Organization Law, amending the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, establishing an organization during the Assembly's adjournment, and the issue of National Assembly representatives' compensation. Among them, the case for establishing an organization was the most numerous, with as many as seven proposed names. Those related to general administration were the principles of reforming politics and the establishment of administrative organizations, etc. Lin Bin explained the local autonomy section, which included several points such as provincial and county autonomy general rules and the rapid completion of local autonomy. Zhong Jiemin explained the judicial examination section, totaling eleven cases, which were relatively simple. Luo Wenmo explained the other cases, totaling thirty-nine cases, which were more complicated because they covered a broad scope and could not be categorized. After each convener finished explaining, they began to speak and express opinions widely. In total, 22 people spoke, most of whom elaborated on the issue of transferring constitutional amendments, and believed that it was necessary to establish an organization after the adjournment. However, among the opinions raised by the speakers, there was no consensus on the name of the organization, and there were different views on the number of members of the committee and whether they should be paid or unpaid positions. For example, Li Hongru stated that forming a Constitutional Review Committee, with the National Government employing the current representatives, would be a paid position. Pan Gongzhan stated that organizing an organization to review and study the Constitution was a factual necessity, and it was also included in Article 7 of the National Assembly Organization Law, which stated that "special review committees may be established when necessary." Therefore, he suggested that the General Assembly establish a special review committee, which could be called the "Constitutional Review Committee," and that the committee should regularly discuss constitutional amendment proposals and submit a concrete report to the Extraordinary General Assembly in the 39th year for discussion. Pan opposed the establishment of a resident committee because it had no basis in the Constitution or the National Assembly Organization Law. Secondly, Pan believed that the number of members should be small and unpaid. Liu Jiashu believed that a constitutional implementation supervision organization should be established, with the National Government inviting all National Assembly representatives to serve. Sun Yafu believed that a permanent organization could be established, but it must have a small number of members, without the need for government employment, and certainly not the large organization of the Committee for the Promotion of Constitutional Implementation. Shi Shangkuan also believed that a special committee could be established, but it must be unpaid. Finally, the Chairman announced that the time was late, and that some of the representatives who had spoken had proposed that the various opinions be handed over to the conveners for collation, to draft a review opinion, and then hand it over to the review committee for discussion, seeking the agreement of the meeting. The Chairman also stated that special attention would be paid to the opinions of the representatives during the drafting, and that issues such as organizational structure would be included. The meeting then adjourned.

The meeting resumed at 3:50 PM. Chairman Fu Boping presented the preliminary review opinions collated by the convener's meeting for discussion. A total of 160 cases had been provisionally drafted with preliminary review opinions, which were presented for discussion one by one. Among them, the most important was the issue of establishing an organization during the adjournment of the General Assembly, which was passed after a relatively long period of discussion. Regarding the "Proposal to Complete Local Autonomy as Soon as Possible," the majority were very active in implementing provincial and county autonomy, and hoped that the various preparations could be completed as soon as possible. The rest of the cases were passed smoothly. Important ones included those related to reforming politics, severely punishing corruption, rectifying officialdom, streamlining redundant agencies, establishing a personnel system, improving the treatment of public school teachers, and ensuring the basic freedoms and rights of the people, all of which were sent to the government for handling or reference. As for the proposals related to determining the next session, amending the Constitution, formulating the Temporary Provisions for Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion, and authorizing the President, they were no longer discussed because the General Assembly had already made decisions on them.

### Petitions; National Assembly Will Not Accept According to Law

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] Since the First Session of the First National Assembly, several petitions have been received, most of which belong to matters within the scope of governance. According to the scope of the General Assembly's powers granted by the Constitution, no decisions can be made. It is learned that when the Presidium of the General Assembly discussed these types of petitions, in addition to forwarding the received cases to the government, it also resolved that the General Assembly would not accept petitions according to law and should directly appeal to the government's competent authorities.

### Chairman Cables Thanks to Ju Zheng

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Chairman Chiang recently cabled a reply to President Ju Zheng, saying: "Ju Juesheng, I am aware, I have read the telegram of the 19th. I am honored to have been elected. Thinking of the difficulties of the times, I feel the increased weight of responsibility. Sir, you are an experienced elder statesman. I hope you will continue to provide guidance so that I may make up for my shortcomings. I respectfully send this cable to express my gratitude, Chiang Kai-shek, April 20th."

### Constitutional Rule Begins Amidst National Crisis; Celebrations Must Not Be Extravagant; Head of State's Handwritten Instructions to Save Manpower, Finances, and Resources

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 20th] Chairman Su Wang Maogong recently received a handwritten letter from the Head of State, stating that with the beginning of constitutional rule amidst the national crisis, it is not a time for celebrations, and the people are suffering so much that it is even more inappropriate to have extravagant displays that waste manpower, finances, and resources. There must be no extravagance in the election of the new government and the inauguration of the President. It is hoped that everyone will share the difficulties of the times and earnestly comply. Even if people's organizations take the initiative to launch celebrations, it is hoped that they will be persuaded to be prepared, frugal, and economical. After receiving the telegram, the Provincial Government has issued a notice to its subordinates to understand the Head of State's intention and comply accordingly.

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 20th] Chairman Chiang was honored with the first presidency, and all sectors jointly sent telegrams to congratulate him. All counties flew flags in celebration, and there were plans to hold a large celebration on the day of the oath of office.

### National Defense Proposals All Reviewed; Strict Handling of Chen Cheng Case Reserved; Proposals from Military Reform Group Divided into Eight Categories

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The Second Review Committee met on the morning of the 20th, still dividing into four groups to review the 121 proposals related to national defense. The review ended at noon, and the comprehensive review was held in the afternoon. The National Defense Military General Reform Group reviewed 49 cases, all of which were passed and divided into eight categories: (1) summoning retired and transferred military officers to return to service, (2) improving conscription administration, (3) improving the treatment of officers and soldiers and improving the life of the troops, (4) rectifying military discipline and clarifying rewards and punishments, (5) improving military food transportation and supply methods, (6) improving military shortcomings, (7) exempting military service, (8) others. Please refer to the government for reference and consideration. The Strengthening Anti-Rebellion Military Organization Group reviewed 16 cases, all of which were passed and sent to the government for reference, consideration, or earnest handling. The most important one was the proposal to quickly send a large army to stabilize Henan and recover Luoyang as soon as possible. The review opinion was: It is recommended that the government handle it quickly and recover Luoyang within a time limit. The Strengthening Border Defense Group reviewed 18 cases, all of which were also passed. Among them, the six cases regarding strengthening transportation were merged. Regarding the development of transportation, the rapid restoration of railways completed before the war, and the planning of international lines, it is recommended that the government refer to these principles for consideration. The People's Self-Defense and Anti-Rebellion Group reviewed 38 cases, most of which were sent to the government for reference and verification. The comprehensive review meeting continued in the afternoon, with Chairman Leng Xin passing the review opinions submitted by each subgroup one by one.

[Another Cable] The case of requesting the government to severely punish Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng has been reserved. The case was jointly proposed by He Foqing and 115 others. It was reviewed by the Second Review Committee on the afternoon of the 16th, and the review opinion was decided to be sent to the government for reference. However, among the 35 original proposers, 19 people, including Song Tong, Wu Xietang, Wang Canli, Xu Zhizhong, Hai Jing, and Zhu Jinzhong, recently sent a letter to the General Assembly stating that they had not heard the government's military report before the proposal, so they believed that the military's failure could not be attributed to the Chief of General Staff. Now, listening to the government's report, all military measures were decided by the Supreme Military Conference and handed over to the Chief of General Staff for execution. This responsibility cannot be entirely borne by the Chief of General Staff. The first proposed method in the original proposal is to be reserved. (Note: The first method of the original proposal was "Resolved by the General Assembly, please order the government to remove the Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng from office, and investigate the facts of delaying military opportunities and submit them to military justice for trial." During the comprehensive review by the Third Review Committee on the afternoon of the 20th, the case was submitted and it was decided that the first method would be reserved, and the second method "The General Assembly shall elect representatives to form an investigation team to investigate the senior generals above the division commander who violated military orders and were ineffective in combat, list the facts, and send them to the government for separate punishment, and authorize the Supervisory Yuan to supervise the implementation." was also reserved in conjunction.)

Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and Western medicine practitioners had a major dispute over the two cases of revising the Doctors Law and promoting China's inherent medicine, creating the only disturbance in the review meetings of various groups on the morning of the 20th. Among the proposals related to social security, there were 19 cases belonging to the relief business, which were merged into one case: "Please ask the government to earnestly carry out relief business," and its methods have detailed provisions for regular relief and emergency relief.

### Seventh Review Committee Passes Proposal to Establish Border Policy: Adapt to Local Conditions to Consolidate National Unity

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Seventh Review Committee held a full-day meeting on the 20th, chaired by convener Bai Chongxi, to continue processing 34 proposals related to the border regions. Among them, more than 10 proposals concerned the development of border education, and it was resolved to send them to the government for reference and implementation, striving to provide convenience for young people of all ethnic groups in the border regions to pursue their studies, and to quickly and effectively supplement their facilities. More than 10 proposals concerned border agencies, local organizations, and the appointment of talents from various ethnic groups. It was resolved to either send them to the government for future reference by the Legislative Yuan, or to request the government to strengthen border institutions and recruit talents from various ethnic groups to strengthen ties and consolidate national unity. In addition, during the afternoon session, after heated discussion and amendment, the committee passed the proposal submitted by Muti Yi, a representative from Xinjiang, "Requesting the government to establish a permanent border policy for ethnic minorities in the border regions, so that ethnic minorities in the border regions can achieve the goal of autonomy." Representatives from Xinjiang and Mongolia and Tibet spoke enthusiastically, criticizing the central government's lack of a permanent border policy for ethnic minorities in the border regions in the past, which led to border officials having nothing to follow, and even violating Sun Yat-sen's policy of ethnic equality, discriminating against border compatriots, and causing unrest. In the future, the key to governing the border regions lies in facing reality, recognizing the natural differences between ethnic groups, and promoting various enlightened policies adapted to local conditions to enhance the centripetal force of border compatriots towards the country and consolidate the unity of the Chinese nation. Finally, after Luo Jialun suggested removing the word "self-determination" from the proposal, it was unanimously passed amidst warm applause. Subsequently, the committee also amended and passed Wu Tiekuer's proposal, resolving to request the government to allow the use of the name "Chinese Turkestan" when local people in Xinjiang use the Uyghur language, but this name does not involve the units of political organizations, so that Uyghur and other Turkic compatriots feel that they can legally and freely use the original name of their homeland in their own language within the motherland, and to prevent ambitious people from using this geographical name to engage in incitement. As for other proposals related to various border constructions, they were also reviewed and sent to the government for attention and reference or retained, respectively. By dusk, all 41 proposals related to the border regions had been processed.

### Editorial: Hoping for an Early Convocation of the Peace Conference with Japan

The Review Committee of the National Assembly, held on the 17th, amended and passed the proposal "Requesting the government to determine the principles of the peace treaty with Japan and to convene the peace conference as soon as possible, in order to lay the foundation for world peace and safeguard national rights," and sent it to the government for attention. The full text of the proposal was recorded in this newspaper on the 18th. The content is divided into two parts: one is the preparation for the peace treaty with Japan, that is, the procedural issues of convening the peace conference; the other is the main points of the content and preamble of the treaty, that is, the key points of the treaty clauses. Just as the issue of convening the preparatory meeting for the peace conference with Japan is mired in division, the government and the people of our country hope to break this deadlock. The passage of this proposal by the National Assembly is sufficient to show the concern of hundreds of millions of people in our country about the Japanese issue, as well as the importance they attach to the content of the peace treaty with Japan.

The issue of convening the peace conference with Japan is the most complex and critical issue in Far Eastern diplomacy at the current stage. In the past six months, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have been arguing over procedural issues, with divergent opinions and dangerous situations, and have reached a stalemate. Judging from the current indications, the United States and the Soviet Union have well-thought-out plans and their own intentions. Only our China is in the most unfavorable situation in the pincer attack of the two poles. In recent months, the United States has been actively supporting Japan and has not hesitated to change the plan of the Far Eastern Commission to control Japan in order to counter the stalemate of the peace conference. The United States seems to no longer need to convene the peace conference with Japan. If this stalemate is not urgently sought to be broken, the US policy of supporting Japan will continue to develop, and the result will inevitably lead to the division of the Allied countries, and even expand the crisis in the Far East. We Chinese do not want to see the division of the Allied countries, and even more do not want to see the flames of war in the Far East again. Therefore, our position is to hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will coordinate on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, and complete the signing of the treaty as soon as possible. The proposal passed by the National Assembly represents the strength of this call. We hope that the authorities, and also appeal to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, to use their wisdom, broaden their horizons, seek compromise, and quickly convene the peace conference with Japan, so as to avoid the growth of the Far East crisis. The voice of the Chinese people is a sincere and loud voice. The principles passed by the National Assembly in this proposal are the minimum requirements and should be responded to in any case.

Regarding the procedure of the peace conference with Japan, the proposal passed by the National Assembly has two principles, which are practical and reasonable. First, regarding the voting method, the four powers should fully retain the right of veto; second, regarding the location of the conference, it should be convened within Chinese territory. These two principles are roughly the same as the content of the Soviet Union's reply to our country's note on November 28 last year. The Soviet Union agreed with our country's suggestion on November 17, stating that the decision on the peace treaty with Japan must be agreed upon by the representatives of the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain. However, it emphasized that before the preparatory meeting of the peace conference, the four powers should hold a meeting of foreign ministers in China to discuss the preparations for the peace conference with Japan. The difference between the Chinese and Soviet statements is that China advocates that the Far Eastern Commission be responsible for drafting the peace treaty, and the four powers retain the right of veto; while the Soviet Union advocates that member states other than the four powers participate in the work of various committees and subcommittees that may be established by the peace conference, and the drafting of the peace treaty be the responsibility of the four foreign ministers' meetings. Because the United States and Britain opposed the Chinese and Soviet proposals, the convening of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference was mired in a stalemate. This time, the suggestion of our National Assembly does not involve the relationship of the Far Eastern Commission. Is it closer to the Soviet Union's opinion, hoping to use the principle of Chinese-Soviet unity to exchange for the unity of the four countries, and to seek to break the stalemate in the preparatory stage of the peace conference, which remains to be studied by the diplomatic authorities.

Regarding the content of the peace treaty with Japan, the proposal passed by the National Assembly is divided into eight categories: political, economic, military, territorial, compensation, ideological, control, and supervision of implementation. It is a complete outline of the peace treaty. Looking closely at the various principles, it takes the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration as its spirit, and thoroughly eliminating Japan's economic armament and ideological armament as its main goal, in order to achieve the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Japan. It is very ideal. Except for a few principles that need to be discussed, most of them are propositions that meet the requirements of the people of our country. For example, in the political aspect, to establish a peaceful and democratic political system, it is necessary to abolish the Emperor system; in the economic aspect, to thoroughly eliminate the potential of military industry, it is necessary to expand compensation. As for the retention of the industrial level, whether it is correct to set it at the level of 1928-30, it needs to be studied by experts. In terms of territory, the claim is limited to Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Hokkaido, which is relatively harsh. Because the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations stipulate that Japan's "adjacent small islands" in the mainland, under the principle of not including Okinawa, should all belong to Japan. This is an issue related to the survival and growth of the Japanese people, and it is necessary to study it carefully; militarily, attention should be paid to eliminating the existence of armed potential, and ideologically, attention should be paid to preventing the revival of militaristic thought, and these should be combined with strict control. These are all set up to thoroughly eliminate Japan's economic armament and ideological armament. As for the time of control, this proposal advocates 50 years of control, which seems excessive. The purpose of controlling Japan is to supervise the effective implementation of the treaty clauses, and it does not require 50 years. In the past, some people advocated 25 to 30 years to supervise Japan's compliance with the peace treaty, which is more reasonable.

In short, the various principles of the proposal passed by the National Assembly are generally correct. It is the requirement of the people of our country, and it is a more organized proposition, which deserves the attention of both China and foreign countries. Now, the issue of convening the peace conference with Japan has become a stalemate due to the divergence of opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union. If this stalemate continues to develop, the future of the Far East will be unimaginable. Our country hopes to break this stalemate. People in both the government and the opposition hold the same hope. After the National Assembly passed this proposal, it was sent to the government for attention and adoption. We hope that the diplomatic authorities will make further efforts to break the deadlock in the peace conference with Japan. At the same time, we also hope that Allied politicians will cherish the calls of the people of our country and take responsibility for rebuilding peace in the Far East, break the current stalemate, and convene the peace conference with Japan as soon as possible!

### The Sino-Japanese Trade Deadlock: It Will Be Broken Soon; Tang Jusheng Speaks After Visiting MacArthur Again

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Tang Jusheng, a representative of the trade group of our country's delegation to Japan, issued a statement this afternoon after visiting MacArthur, head of the Economics and Scientific Section of the Allied Headquarters, for the second time, saying that the Sino-Japanese trade deadlock would be broken soon and could be restarted. According to Tang, MacArthur had agreed to our government's decision to separate the accounts of various private merchants from the 10 billion yuan of legal tender owed by the Central Trust Bureau. The Allied Headquarters hoped that this debt would be cleared by the Central Trust Bureau. MacArthur had frankly overturned the suggestion made by the Central Trust Bureau to allocate the debt as part of Japan's compensation to China. MacArthur agreed that Sino-Japanese private trade would adopt a barter system due to China's shortage of foreign exchange, and allowed the issuance of entry permits to another twelve Chinese businessmen so that they could understand the trade situation between China and Japan. Tang continued to say that the Allied Headquarters will soon compile a table of the debts owed by the Central Trust Bureau, and he himself will study the method of repaying this debt. This debt is the main reason why Sino-Japanese trade has almost fallen into a deadlock.

### An Authoritative Figure in the Education Community Talks About the Irrationality of the Public Funding System: Believes that Most of the Education Funds Should Be Used for Basic Education

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Recently, some students in colleges and universities have requested the government to provide full public funding, and even engaged in hunger strikes and parades. According to an authoritative figure in the education community who spoke to reporters, there is no precedent in the world for providing all food expenses to students in colleges and universities. Most young people who are determined to study use the income from their own labor to pay for their education expenses. In various countries, there are many great people who have achieved success through part-time work and study. This was also the case in our country before the War of Resistance. Moreover, the implementation of the public funding system has resulted in student food expenses and public funding accounting for a shocking figure in the entire education expenditure item. According to recent statistics, the public funding for students in public and private colleges and universities across the country in April alone required 286 billion yuan (including public-funded students in provincial private colleges and universities), while the regular expenses and temporary expenses for colleges and universities in the same month were only 79.1 billion yuan, and the living allowance for employees was 405.5 billion yuan, totaling 484.6 billion yuan, which is a ratio of 1.6 to 1 compared with student public funding, that is, student public funding accounts for more than 35% of the cost of higher education.

When President Chiang and the presidents of various national universities recently had a dinner, he said that education funding would be increased again. I (the person in authority claimed) believe that in the future, education funding should be used to the greatest extent on basic education and on eliminating illiteracy, because it is not only unreasonable but also unfair for a citizen whose children have received basic education to pay taxes to provide food for a college student. When the country enters the constitutional stage, if there is financial strength, it should do its best to promote national education, which is the proper and reasonable way.

### National Assembly Chronicle; Vice Presidential Election Heats Up

[This Newspaper Special] On the majestic and beautiful wall above the entrance of the National Assembly Hall, where the presidential candidates were announced four days ago, the announcement of the vice-presidential candidates was replaced on the 20th. The style and wording of the announcement are generally the same. The only difference is that the list of vice-presidential candidates includes six people: Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, Mo Dehui, and Xu Fulin. Only two people ran for president, which, in colloquial terms, was a foregone conclusion. Yesterday's election results have confirmed this. Six people are competing for the vice-presidency, but there is only one position. Only one of these six can be elected. On whose head will this luck fall? The election will be held on the 23rd, and the results will be announced after noon on the 23rd. There is no doubt that the competition will heat up in the days leading up to the election.

In fact, the vice-presidential campaign began as early as a month ago. It went from publicity to actual activity after the opening of the conference. Especially as the election date approached, the activity became more intense. Among these six candidates, as the order progresses, the more active were the first names, and the least active were the last names. Vice Chairman Sun hosted the National Assembly representatives in batches, giving a different speech at each reception. Dean Yu, Director Li, and Director Cheng hosted them later, but they were also held one by one. Only Committee Member Mo hosted the latest. Committee Member Xu's campaign, as he himself said, "To avoid a lot of trouble, it is better to participate in the campaign myself." So his activities are minimal, almost non-existent. In addition to banquets, there were also broadcasts, speeches, visits, and interviews, etc. Vice Chairman Sun and Dean Yu's propaganda offensives were the most intense. The huge oil portraits on both sides of the National Assembly Hall attracted the most attention from the representatives and citizens. On the morning of the 20th, Dean Yu's propaganda car also appeared on the streets. In addition to the huge油画 oil painting portrait, there was also amplified broadcasting, which attracted many citizens to watch. Newspaper publicity was also clearly divided into camps, and people's attitudes toward them were obvious at a glance.

When the nomination signing method was announced, the first round of close combat began in the venue. The signature book required the representatives to sign their names. Eating, entertaining, watching movies, and giving墨寳 ink treasures seemed to offset the effect. Signing required on-the-spot persuasion. Some units used the average distribution method, allocating a certain number of representatives to each person to sign. Some representatives used the method of accepting everyone, signing for everyone, regardless of whether it was valid. At that time, the people who were actively signing were full of秋喜 joy, but by midnight on the 19th, it gave the presidium a headache. When Gu Yuxiu and other twelve chairmen were responsible for checking the signatures on the nomination forms, they found 884 duplicate names. The representatives who used the "accept everyone" method had signed on three, four, or even six nomination forms. The nomination form of Sun Ke had the most invalid names, with 250 people, and Xu Fulin also had 18 invalid names. This was still the statistics at 2:00 AM on the 20th. The presidium still had 50 letters that had not been opened at this time. These letters all contained statements about the signing. A representative wrote in a letter to Hong Lanyou: "I originally signed Vice Chairman Sun, but for the sake of politeness, I had to sign Dean Yu. Please Hong take the signature of Vice Chairman Sun as the standard when reviewing the list." From this, we can see the熟烈 intensity of the competition in the first round.

When the candidate nominations were announced, the identities of these six candidates were confirmed. The fierce competition will unfold in the next three days. Voting is different from signing. According to the single-name method during the election, each representative can only choose one person, unless they intend to invalidate the ballot. The choice of each representative will be made at the moment when they pick up the ballot and pick up the pen. Except for the truly mass, truly supporters, there will be no doubt when choosing, the choices of other free representatives will determine the future destiny of these six.

It is impossible to predict the election results now, but the number of signatures can be used as a reference. According to the provisions of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the vice-presidential election procedure is the same as the presidential election procedure: "The candidate who receives more than half of the total number of votes of the representatives is elected. If no one receives the prescribed majority of votes, the top three candidates with the most votes will be revoted, selecting one candidate. If no one is elected, a third vote will be held, selecting one candidate. If no one is still elected, the top two candidates with the most votes in the third vote will be revoted, selecting one candidate, and the one with the most votes will be elected." Many people estimate that because the vice-presidential election has six candidates, excluding one or two with relatively weak strengths, most of the others are equal, it will not be as simple as the presidential election and may require four votes.

What will be the fate of the candidates? What will be the choices of the representatives? We still have to look at the efforts in the three days before the election. (April 20th, Nanjing)

### Weixian Recaptured After Fierce Battle; Jinan Conducts Citywide Census

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 20th] The battle for Weixian City has entered a fever pitch on the night of the 19th, with bandits using more than 8,000 of their main forces to pounce on the four passes.

It is heard that the French delegation advocates the establishment of a German federal government, with guarantees regarding the utilization of Ruhr production attached, which can be agreed upon by agreement and placed under international control. British Commander-in-Chief Robertson met with Foreign Secretary Bevin at the Foreign Office this morning, and it was heard that he discussed the situation in Berlin, with particular emphasis on the case of the plane collisions at the Gatow Airport.

### Italian Anti-Communist Front Wins Overwhelming Victory in General Election; Prime Minister Says He Will Never Allow the Communist Party to Participate in the New Government

[This Newspaper] London, 20th broadcast: Rome news, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi met alone with a United Press reporter today and said that there is no possibility of accommodating the Communist Party in the future Italian new government.

He made it clear that if he continues as Prime Minister, he will never consider recruiting the Communist Party into the cabinet.

[Reuters, Rome, 20th] The Ministry of the Interior announced the temporary results of the Italian Senate election on the 20th. The ratio of votes obtained by the Christian Democratic Party to the votes obtained by the People's Front is three to one.

Later, Christian Democratic Party Secretary-General Bizzivoni personally told a Reuters reporter that the party's victory can be called unprecedented. He said, "The victory of the Christian Democratic Party was foreseeable, but it was not expected to be such a great achievement. This means that Italian democracy has been保阵 guaranteed and has become more consolidated."

When the news of the慘败 disastrous defeat of the Communist Party in North, Central and South Italy spread to Rome,沮丧 depression and disappointment spread quickly among the Communists like wildfire. What shocked Communist supporters the most was that in the areas of northern Italy traditionally known as Communist strongholds, such as the industrial town of Milan, the Communist Party suffered a catastrophic defeat. However, Italian Communist leader Togliatti's official declaration on Rome Radio still stated, "We must accept the destined fate."

### Recent Election Results: Communist Party Suffers Crushing Defeat

[United Press, Rome, 20th] In the senatorial elections, with three-quarters of the districts counted today, the Christian Democratic Party has won approximately half of the total votes.

Interior Minister Scelba has announced that a number of people have been arrested for electoral fraud.

### British Officialdom Attaches Importance to Communist Activities in the Far East

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] According to the Daily Telegraph's foreign correspondent, a conservative newspaper, officialdom here is giving great importance to the increasing communist activities in the various colonies. The author claims that the Communist Information Bureau is intensifying its movements to incite riots and sabotage the economies of the colonial territories of Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands by means of slowdowns. According to news from the Southeast Asian areas that are under the greatest threat, it is believed that the Far East Communist Information Bureau, under the leadership of Communist Party elements in China, will soon be established. Malaya is the place where communist infiltration is deepest. They use the Malayan People's United Front as a cover. The United Front is mostly controlled by Communist Party members and has established contact with Communist Parties in Burma, Australia and other places in the Far East.

[Central News Agency, Rangoon, 19th] The Information Department announced tonight that yesterday a battle took place between government troops and bandits in a village near Dakon, a district in P'yaman Township, along the Rangoon-Mandalay Highway, about 200 miles from Rangoon.

### US Secretly Tests Atomic Bomb on Eniwetok Island to Gain a Broader Understanding of its Military Effectiveness

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The US Atomic Energy Commission has issued a brief statement announcing that the United States has conducted a test of new atomic weapons on Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean, with excellent results. The statement also said that the date of the test could not be announced for security reasons. The test was conducted in accordance with the safety restrictions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. Other information about the test will not be released publicly for the time being.

The Atomic Energy Commission's statement then reviewed the developments prior to the test, saying that since last December, construction of a new atomic weapons test site has begun on Eniwetok Island. A mobile unit composed of the Army, Navy, and Air Force completed the construction of the test site in the late winter of 1947. Large-scale equipment has been installed there for use by scientific and technical teams. The main purpose of the test site is to provide scientific and engineering protection for improved designs. The scientific and technical tests at the test site can provide new basic information and a broader understanding of the principles of nuclear fission for peaceful use and the military effectiveness of atomic energy. Officials of the Atomic Energy Commission have refused to disclose any details about the test. Scientists believe that the new weapon tested has made further progress in the principle of nuclear fission compared to the atomic bomb, and has completed amazing progress in the development of atomic energy. The most common speculation in recent weeks has been that the United States will conduct a deep-water atomic bomb test, the main goal of which is to test the resistance of submarines to atomic weapons. According to what is known to the outside world, there have been a total of five atomic bombs detonated before this. The first was tested in the desert of New Mexico on July 16, 1945, the second was dropped on Hiroshima, the third was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, and two were dropped during atomic bomb tests on Bikini Island in June and July 1946. It is still unknown whether the one tested this time on Eniwetok was an atomic bomb or another form of weapon.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Scientist Albert Einstein now supports Third Party candidate Wallace for president. The party believes that the United States already has sufficient military superiority and should not have other ambitions, so whether Einstein is still willing to work to improve the atomic bomb is questionable. Scientists believe that it is possible to increase the power of existing atomic bombs or to manufacture new types of atomic bombs that are hundreds or thousands of times stronger, but this is not expected to be realized at present. The government had previously announced that the efficiency of atomic bombs had been greatly increased, referring only to the production process and not to their efficiency. Some people believe that this is just an ordinary experiment and that there are no new types of weapons involved. The results of this experiment prove the necessity of cooperation between special units of the Army and Navy. The existence of this special unit has been kept secret until now. After the completion of this test, other tests will continue to be held. The Atomic Energy Commission has issued a warning that the Eniwetok area will be a dangerous area forever in 1948. President Truman ordered the extension of the term of office of the Atomic Energy Commission's instructors, and his intention is very clear. He wants to keep the secrets of atomic development and ensure that this knowledge is only obtained by a very small number of people.

### Freedom of Information Conference Passes Three Proposals; General Assembly Expected to Conclude Soon

[Reuters, Geneva, 20th] The 55-nation Freedom of Information Conference unanimously passed three resolutions in cheers on the 19th: eliminating war, fascist or Nazi propaganda; banning false or distorted news; and prohibiting the dissemination of propaganda promoting racial or national hatred. Indian representative Mukherjee earnestly urged the governments of the participating countries to avoid actions that could cause war debates in newspapers and radio stations. When referring to the so-called term "war mongers," he expressed doubts about its true definition. He believes that news reporters who point out war crises are not necessarily war mongers. To prevent war-mongering behavior, it is necessary to pay attention to the true causes of war-mongering behavior. The reason lies in the uneven distribution of national power, so the strong feel the temptation to use pressure, while the weak feel the temptation to succumb. Succumbing to these temptations is enough to cause incidents, which eventually lead to war-mongering behavior. Mr. Mukherjee also believes that the best way to guarantee freedom of information is to promote a sense of discipline in newspapers and to establish tribunals to enforce these disciplines to encourage them.

[US Information Service, Geneva, 19th] The World Freedom of Information Conference, which opened here on March 23, is expected to conclude its work tomorrow.

### Truman Sends Congratulations

### More Than a Thousand Railway Workers Go on Strike and Lie on the Tracks, Halting Traffic on Two Lines
### Work Resumes After Persuasion, "Jinling" Train First to Resume Service
### Deputy Director and Union Representatives Go to Nanjing

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, railway workers on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines went on strike to protest the cancellation of rice subsidies. Starting at 12 noon, more than 1,500 workers from the Railway Bureau's machinery and works departments went on strike and gathered at the North Railway Station, sitting and lying on the tracks to prevent trains from departing. Deputy Director Xie of the Bureau immediately convened an emergency meeting with worker representatives. Around 4 PM, the workers accepted the persuasion of Chief Wang Zhaohuai of the police department and others, and left the tracks. The first train, the "Jinling" express, departed at 4 PM under the armed protection of more than a hundred police officers, and traffic on the two lines resumed after a four-hour interruption. Director Chen Bozhuang of the Bureau had departed a few days ago to inspect stations in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang. Yesterday, after receiving the news by telephone in Nanjing, he immediately met with Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation to request instructions on the issue of compensation. Railway union representative Pan Bingsheng, Deputy Director Xie Zhen, Personnel Director Sun Dangyue, and Police Chief Wang Zhaohuai took the night train to Nanjing to report the situation to Director Chen in person.

The compensation of Railway Bureau employees has been calculated based on the public education personnel index, plus a 30% business allowance and a rice subsidy of eight dou (eight dou for staff and technicians, six dou for ordinary workers, and four dou for apprentices and waiters). The housing subsidy is uniformly two dou and five sheng of rice. Starting in April, the index increased to 240,000 times, and the Ministry of Transportation ordered that all housing and rice subsidies be canceled. After learning of this news, railway workers repeatedly gathered to discuss countermeasures. Fearing that this regulation would be too stimulating for the workers, the Bureau temporarily did not make it public, which made the workers' emotions even more unstable. Yesterday was the Bureau's payday (payday was originally scheduled for the 10th and 20th of each month, but it was customary to pay one or two days earlier). Anxious to understand the situation, the workers from the machinery and works departments held a meeting at the Wuzhen Road Bridge Workers' Club at 8:30 AM. The Bureau also received the news at this time, and Deputy Director Xie immediately convened a meeting of senior Bureau officials to discuss countermeasures and telegraphed Director Chen in Nanjing.

Marched to the Station and Blocked Trains from Entering and Leaving

At 12 noon, the workers marched to the North Railway Station, demanding that the rice subsidy be maintained, and blocked various trains from leaving and arriving at the station, creating a very serious situation. Driver Wang Apei attempted to drive train number 25 himself, but was dragged down and beaten by the workers. Union director Zhou Lansheng was injured by a stone while trying to persuade the workers to leave. A temporary curfew was imposed at the North Station, and all trains arriving in Shanghai were stopped at Zhenru and the West Station, with passengers transported by trucks dispatched by the Bureau. Railway Bureau Deputy Director Xie Zhen, Chief of General Affairs Wang Yunsun, Deputy Chief Chen Fenke, Personnel Director Sun Dangyue, Police Chief Wang Zhaohuai, Chief of the Road News Section Peng Fenggang, Commissioner Zhang Yunhe, and union representatives Yuan Qiaofu, Wang Cheng, Pan Bingxin, Shi Zhi'an, Lin Changgen, and Zhou Lansheng held an emergency meeting and decided to first persuade the workers to resume work, express sympathy for their demands for rice and housing subsidies, and be willing to be responsible for striving for them with the Ministry of Transportation.

Persuade Workers to Resume Work, Guarantee Negotiations on Compensation

The twelve people went to the end of platform six at the North Station to persuade the workers to resume work, guaranteeing that they would be responsible for negotiating the compensation issue. Chief Wang Zhaohuai further emphasized the importance of transportation during the suppression of the rebellion, and warned them to be careful to prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to infiltrate and disrupt. The workers also deeply understood the importance of their own duties, so they agreed to resume work first and wait for a reply by 12 noon today. The traffic on the two lines, which had been deadlocked for four hours, was finally restored. Yesterday, the delayed trains included train number 25, which was delayed by three hours and eight minutes, train number 2 ("Jinling"), which was delayed by two and a half hours, train number 74, which was delayed by two hours and two minutes, train number 1 ("Qiantang"), which was delayed by two hours and twenty-five minutes, train number 41, which was delayed by one hour and twenty-five minutes, train number 58, which was delayed by two hours and twenty minutes, and train number 43, which was delayed by forty minutes. Train number 1 ("Jinling") arrived two hours and ten minutes late, train number 5 arrived one hour and five minutes late, and train number 77 arrived one hour and twenty minutes late. The remaining trains number 84, 82, 80, 51, 44, and 7 were also delayed.

### Infant Welfare Association Reclaims Self-Management
### Pan Gongzhan Claims Ignorance

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 20th] Mr. Pan Gongzhan told reporters on the 20th regarding the Shanghai Infant Welfare Association that he believes infant welfare should be managed by the public sector, as private management may not achieve the best results due to manpower and financial resources. Therefore, the Infant Welfare Association agreed with Mayor Wu last winter to change it to a municipal institution, to be taken over by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The board of directors of the association was dissolved, and his title as chairman of the board no longer exists. He has not interfered in whether the association will continue to operate after being taken over by the Bureau of Social Affairs. When the Bureau of Social Affairs took over the association, it promised to repay part of the debt. Recently, President Tan Boqin came to Nanjing and said that the debt has not been fully paid. He will write to Director Wu Kaixian to request payment. He recently received a reply from Wu, stating that the debt has been fully paid. Now President Yun intends to reclaim the association for self-management. He knows nothing about this matter and has not written to Director Wu to request the return of the association's buildings.

### Bureau of Social Affairs Statement
### Not Approved for Municipalization

[Report from our newspaper] According to information from the Bureau of Social Affairs, the details about the closure of the Infant Welfare Association published in various newspapers and attributed to Tan Boqin are largely inconsistent with the facts. Since its establishment, the association has not been registered in accordance with the law. Last September, according to Tan Boqin's report, due to financial difficulties, it was impossible to continue operating, and he requested the Bureau to take over and repay the debts. The Bureau considered the difficulties stated to be factual and approved its closure. The Bureau has since repaid the association's debts to the bank and paid severance fees to the employees. After the closure of the association, the vacant buildings were occupied. It was not until January of this year that the Bureau was able to take over after several negotiations. After consulting with the Bureau of Health, it was determined that the buildings were too small to operate a childcare facility. According to Tan Boqin, the original main building of the association was privately leased and could not be transferred, so the branch building was allocated to the Shanghai Workers' Welfare Association. There was no approval for municipalization in the original case.

### Categories A and B National Soldiers

### China Cement Company
### Hosts Visit for Reporters

[Report from our newspaper] The National Cement Industry Association, in order to allow the outside world to understand the current situation of the cement industry, specially invited reporters to visit the Longtan Cement Factory, which belongs to the member company China Cement Company. The factory is surrounded by mountains on three sides, covering an area of more than 2,000 acres. The mountains where the factory is located are of limestone nature, and the factory has obtained mining rights, estimated to be continuously mined for more than 200 years. The supply of cement's main raw materials can be guaranteed for a long time.

The factory currently has more than 300 regular workers and more than 400 temporary workers. The highest output is 4,500 barrels per day. Recently, new equipment was purchased from the United States, shipped to China, and installed, increasing daily production by 3,000 barrels. The factory now has four giant furnaces, but unfortunately, due to insufficient power, they cannot be fully operational. When reporters visited the site, they saw that some of the production equipment was idle.

### Rationing of Daily Necessities
### Many Practical Difficulties
### Review Results in Temporary Postponement
### Suggest that China Textile Corporation Distribute Cloth at Par Prices

[Report from our newspaper] The Daily Necessities Rationing Review Subcommittee of the Cost of Living Index Compilation Research Association held a meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, chaired by Director Gu Bingyuan, to discuss the specific rationing plan. As a result, it was considered that there were too many technical difficulties in the proposed rationing of the eight items of daily necessities: soy sauce, cigarettes, firewood, salt, soap, toilet paper, matches, and socks. The weight in the cost of living index is very small. If it is necessary to do so, it is feared that the gains will not outweigh the losses, so it was decided to postpone it temporarily. Cotton cloth has the highest proportion, accounting for one-third of the total of nine daily necessities. However, private textile factories are unable to supply cloth due to a lack of raw materials, so it was decided to recommend that the government organize par price distribution through the China Textile Construction Corporation. According to Director Gu, the total percentage of the nine daily necessities in the index is only 18%, and even if all of them are rationed, the impact on the index will be very small. According to the calculation method of the index, each month requires four boxes of matches, 33 jin of firewood, one chi of plain cloth, four chi of colored cloth, half a pair of socks, fifteen packs of cigarettes, four and a half pieces of soap, 1.33 dao of toilet paper, six jin of soy sauce, and four and a half jin of salt. If calculated based on 600,000 workers in the city (400,000 industrial workers and 200,000 vocational workers), the total capital required would be 625.6 billion yuan, averaging about 1.04 million yuan per worker. If the allocated items are not suitable, it would not be very practical. For the benefit of the workers and the practical difficulties of rationing, it was decided to abandon the original intention of rationing daily necessities.

### Applications for Compensation Machinery Exceed Three Times the Number Available

[Report from our newspaper] According to relevant sources, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has received more than 1,000 pieces of working machinery as compensation from Japan, but the number of applications from private factories is at least three times that number. Therefore, the review work in the future will be extremely tedious and may not be completed within the next month. As for the review criteria, on the one hand, the performance and history of the applicant factory will be considered to determine whether it has the ability to use the compensation materials. At the same time, it will also be considered whether it has sufficient financial resources to pay on time according to the contract. Currently, all civilian materials arriving in Shanghai are still stored in the China Merchants Bureau's No. 7 Wharf warehouse. Among the working machinery, the large ones weigh up to eight or nine tons, and the average is about four tons. In the future, the price of reselling to private factories will be calculated in US dollars, but nothing is known here about the work of the valuation committee.

### Sixteen Chinese Nationals Returning from Soviet Union Arrive in Shanghai

### Manager of Hollywood Candy Factory, Yang Jingzhou, Goes Missing En Route to Taiwan for Inspection
### Passengers in Same Cabin Saw Him Arguing with Someone Over Ticket
### Bizarre Letters and Notes Found in His Suitcase

[Report from our newspaper] Yang Jingzhou, manager and technician of the Hollywood Candy Factory at No. 35, Lane 345, Daxi Road, Shanghai West, was introduced by the China United Property Insurance Company last month to go to Taiwan to inspect the No. 61 Sugar Factory managed by the Xinghe Enterprise Company. On the 3rd of this month, he was accompanied by a staff member of the company on the Zhongxing wheel to Taiwan. On the 9th, a telegram was received from Keelung stating that he would take a boat back to Shanghai on the 10th. Unexpectedly, on the 13th, Hollywood Factory suddenly received a telegram from the Shanghai Minsheng Company stating that the company's Minzhong wheel, which came to Shanghai from Heqi, had a passenger named Yang Jingzhou who had gone missing en route, leaving behind a handbag. After Hollywood Factory sent staff to investigate the passengers who returned to Shanghai in the same cabin at the time, Wu Heming (resident at No. 12, Ningbo East Road) and Wu Changsheng (resident at No. 16, Lane 183, Laodagu Road), it was proven that when Yang boarded the ship, several people were seen preventing him from leaving Taiwan and snatching his ticket. The two sides argued for a long time. After the ship departed, Yang had talked to them, but suddenly went missing after 2 AM the next morning. The factory has now sent staff to Taiwan to investigate this bizarre disappearance case, and reported it to the Port Investigation and Guard Team and the Police Bureau to investigate the truth. According to the person in charge of the Hollywood Factory yesterday, Yang is a Shanghainese, 47 years old, graduated from St. John's University in his early years, and has unique insights into the manufacture of chocolate candy. Guanshengyuan hired him as a consultant. He used to be a technician at the foreign firm Sullivan Factory for four years, and was once sent to Japan by the factory to inspect the manufacture of chocolate candy. After returning to China, he studied carefully and strived for perfection. The internal billet materials of Chinese candy factories that imitate chocolate candy are mostly purchased from him. Therefore, after hearing the news, the factory urgently sent a special commissioner to take a plane to Taiwan to investigate the truth, and is expected to return to Shanghai today. In his abandoned handbag were a diary, a New Testament Bible, and several letters. One letter to a friend in his factory said, "I am in his ring, there is no way to think..." and a note inserted in the Bible read, "Father! Father! Is there salvation? Life and death are great numbers." The diary only recorded events up to the 9th. The above-mentioned documents have now been handed over to a lawyer for safekeeping. It is said that Yang has simple luggage, which is still in the Taiwan No. 61 Factory.

### Acquittal but Continued Detention, Wen Guangting Files Complaint with City Council, Detention Center Says He Was Taken to District Court, District Court Says He Was Not Taken, Cha Liangjian Says He Can Be Released at Any Time

[Report from our newspaper] Wen Guangting, a technician at the Hu Xinghua Foundry at No. 314 Qipu Road in this city, was previously transferred to the local court for investigation and trial by the Xinshi Street Police Station on charges of banditry and theft. After Judge Cao Zuwei tried the case, he pronounced Wen Guangting not guilty on January 24, and the remaining parts were not accepted. He ordered bail in court, and the bailiff Xu Jingkuan took him to the He Xing Foundry at No. 594 Kunming Road to find bail. According to the bailiff's report, the factory refused to provide bail, so Judge Cao ordered continued detention.

Recently, Wen Guangting, in the Sinan Road Detention Center, filed a complaint with the Human Rights Protection Committee of the City Council, accusing Cao Baosheng, a volunteer police officer of the Xinshi Street Police Station, and plainclothes police officers of the station of malicious framing and forced confessions, and Judge Cao Zuwei and bailiff Xu Jingkuan of colluding to solicit bribes.

In order to understand the inside story of the case, the reporter went to the Sinan Road Detention Center yesterday to talk to Wen Guangting, who was in custody. According to Director Tian Lixun, "He was taken to the district court at 8 AM this morning." So he rushed to the district court, but the district court firmly stated that he had not been taken. This matter is even more confusing.

According to Cha Liangjian, the president of the district court, the case was sent by the Xinshi Street Police Station. The defendants, Wen Guangting and Jin Xinsheng, were accused of using knives to rob single women of their property in Wusong Road, Baoshan Road, and Huangxing Road in December last year and January 12 this year, and of stealing a foreign-style stove from Zhu Qiaobao's home. After Judge Cao tried the case, the banditry part was dismissed because the victims could not be found. As for the theft part, it did not belong to special criminal cases and should be investigated by the district prosecutor's office according to law, so it was ordered not to be accepted. The bailiff took him out for bail. Jin was released on bail, but Wen was continued to be detained without bail. Because no one was willing to bail Wen, the judge expressed suspicion about his behavior. Moreover, because the banditry case was serious, even though the judge ruled him not guilty, the prosecutor might consider it inappropriate and apply for a retrial. Therefore, the defendant continued to be detained during the appeal period, which is not illegal. As for Judge Cao's character, he would never do this. Whether the bailiff used his name to extort money, he could not make a casual judgment before obtaining definite evidence. The reason for the late delivery of the judgment was that the judge was handling too many cases. Finally, President Cha said that if the defendant Wen Guangting had a substantial guarantor, he could be released at any time.

### Yan Peixing Case
### Civil Part Undergoing Mediation
### Wide Gap Between Opinions
### Negotiations Have Not Reached Agreement

[Report from our newspaper] The civil part of the Yan Peixing case is actively undergoing mediation with the help of powerful people. The lawyers of both parties formally negotiated at the Yu Shun Law Firm yesterday, but it is reported that no agreement has been reached. Yan's condition is to recover the lost items from the factory, of which 40 boxes of hardware materials were recovered a few days ago from the home of Hong in No. 31, Sipailou, Nanshi. He is forcing the woman to hand over the remaining ten boxes. The woman's condition is that Yan Peixing give Yuan Baoying 5 billion yuan and break off relations from then on. Because there is a wide gap between the opinions of both parties, the negotiations have not reached a result. However, even if the civil part of the case is settled, the police bureau has transferred all the files of the criminal part to the district prosecutor's office for investigation. Whether it can also be settled with the civil part will depend on how the district prosecutor's office proceeds.

### Tang Xianzong Investigated for Forgery and Embezzlement of Taxes

[Report from our newspaper] Tang Xianzong, a tax collector of the Central District Tax Collection Office of the Bureau of Finance, was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on suspicion of embezzlement and forgery.

When inquiring with Jincheng, it was said that Tang had collected it and there was a receipt to prove it. After verification, it was found that the city bank stamp on the receipt was forged. Tang was detained for investigation. Tang confessed that he had temporarily embezzled more than 10 million yuan of business taxes last year due to heavy expenses and a large family. Later, due to meager income, he could not make up for it. He personally wrote a confession, admitting that he had mistakenly stepped into the legal net due to temporary confusion and requested leniency. After the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, the prosecutor briefly questioned him. Due to conclusive evidence, he was ordered to be detained.

### Sea-Going Vessel Causes Accident Trying to Avoid a Sailboat; Pontoon Pier Damaged; The "Hai Huang" Vessel Safely Enters Port Yesterday

[Our Own Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company vessel "Hai Zhou," which arrived yesterday from Kaohsiung with a large shipment of sugar, arrived at the port around 12:00 noon. When turning around in the Bailianjing River area to dock at Yangjiadu Wharf, it went against the current. Near Yangjiadu Wharf, there was a sailboat that, due to unfavorable wind conditions, was maneuvering and sailing. Initially heading from west to east, the "Hai Zhou" steered to the left to avoid it. In a moment, the sailboat turned again and headed from east to west. Upon seeing this, the "Hai Zhou" quickly steered to the right to avoid it, but unexpectedly the wharf was very close. The ship's hull collided with the wharf, with great force, destroying three pontoon piers, one floating bridge, and one mooring dolphin. Fortunately, the ship's hull was not damaged. After berthing the vessel, the captain reported the details of the incident to the Shipping Affairs Section.

### Three Japanese War Criminals Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday

[Our Own Report] Three Japanese war criminals were executed by firing squad yesterday by the military tribunal: (1) Kari Satoru, former chief of the Chinese Section of the Special High Police of the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters in Vietnam and Deputy Captain of the Hanoi Gendarmerie Platoon, with the rank of captain. His crime was that in 1945 he arrested overseas Chinese Pan Yongchang and Wu Zhisheng and inflicted cruel torture on them. Wu Zhisheng died as a result. (2) Tajima Nobuo, former sergeant major of the Special High Police of the Da Nang Gendarmerie Platoon in Vietnam, and (3) Konishi Shin Saburo, a sergeant. These two criminals arrested overseas Chinese Xu Wenmao and Li Zhongxun on April 5, 1943, and tortured them to death. The above three criminals were sentenced to death by the Guangzhou Headquarters Military Tribunal after the victory, and the sentences had been approved by the Ministry of National Defense. As the original trial court had been closed, they were transferred to Shanghai for execution. Yesterday at noon, Wang Jiamei, Chief Prosecutor of the Military Tribunal, interpreter Wang Renming, and clerk Wang Chenghua, led armed military police to the Tilanqiao Prison to bring forth the three criminals and inform them that they were ordered to be executed. The three criminals were very calm. Each wrote a will and asked to smoke cigarettes. In his will, Kari Satoru even extravagantly talked about "hoping to realize Sino-Japanese cooperation." The three criminals were then escorted to the execution ground by military police and each was killed with one shot.

### Valuation of China Merchants Bureau Assets; Total Value Exceeds US$200 Million; Two Ministries to Form a Joint Committee for Official Valuation

[Our Own Report] The nationalized China Merchants Bureau's sale to private enterprise has been decided in principle. The sale would be half of its total assets. Last week, the bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Communications to first evaluate all its assets and equipment itself and submit this information to the ministry for reference. As for the official valuation, it will be officially determined by a valuation committee jointly formed by the Ministries of Communications and Finance, which will come to Shanghai to conduct an on-site investigation. According to internal estimates of the China Merchants Bureau, the total value of the bureau's assets is over US$200 million, with ships and real estate accounting for the largest part. If half of its assets are sold as shares, the amount will also be over US$100 million. According to related sources, whether the sale will be smooth is still difficult to predict at present. Due to the unstable situation, the shipping industry's freight transport has been greatly affected, and income has sharply decreased. Therefore, it is uncertain whether private shipping companies have the financial capacity to purchase, and whether those with financial resources are willing to invest in the shipping industry is also a problem.

### Youth Plots Check Fraud; Arrested for Cashing Check at Money Exchange

[Our Own Report] A merchant, Chen Yunji, carried a 30 million yuan check from the Shanghai Xie Mao Shen money exchange from Xuzhou to Shanghai to purchase goods. On the train, he met a youth, Wu Kebao. After arriving in Shanghai, Wu led Chen to room 429 of the Zhongnan Hotel near the Dongxinqiao Bridge. Shortly after, they went together to the Simingtang Pharmacy and Liquor Store on the lower floor of the Zhongnan Hotel to wholesale plasters. While they were negotiating prices, Wu suddenly asked Chen about the check and said that Shanghai has many pickpockets and he should be careful to keep it safe. He added it would be safer to leave it to him to look after. Chen then handed the check to Wu, who took the opportunity to escape without a trace. More than an hour later, Chen realized he had been deceived and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau, who sent officers to the Xie Mao Shen money exchange to stop payment. They found that the check had already been paid to the Yi Feng Money Exchange. The next morning, the handling officer and Chen waited at the Yi Feng Money Exchange. At 10:00 AM, Wu actually came to cash the check and was immediately arrested. After interrogation at the station, he confessed to the fraud and was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office to be prosecuted for fraud.

### Review Group Discusses; Postponement of Surplus Rice Purchase

[Our Own Report] The measure for the Food Distribution Committee to purchase rice on the market has been passed by the Municipal Council, but the response from all parties has been negative, believing that it will stimulate market prices. The review group, jointly formed by the Food Distribution Committee and other relevant institutions, held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon at No. 73 Nanjing West Road to discuss the matter. Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others attended. Chairman Ren Xianqun of the Distribution Committee presided over the meeting. After exchanging opinions, it was believed that the purchase policy was a major matter and needed to be considered at length, and its implementation was postponed.

According to Chairman Ren's conversation with reporters: Speaking objectively, it is better for rice to be in the hands of the government than in the hands of merchants. The reasons for the purchase are: (1) After the work of allocating and selling rice begins, it cannot be interrupted under the current economic situation. Purchasing rice can allow the allocation work to continue. (2) Maintaining a proper source for large consumption cities so that those who originally supplied rice to Shanghai can continue to supply it. Although the purchase policy cannot help but stimulate grain prices, it is possible to reduce the stimulation by using technical skills. There are advantages and disadvantages, but it is a long-term plan. Now that public opinion has expressed opposition, those who serve the people should follow public opinion and postpone the implementation. We will wait for the results of discussions from all parties before deciding whether to purchase or not.

[Another Report] According to the Food Distribution Committee, from the 12th to the 17th of last week, a total of 129,035 piculs of American rice were allocated. Including the first and second batches of American rice allocated in April and the government's reserve rice, along with the rice in rice stores carried over from March, a total of 483,831 piculs and 2.5 dou of rice have been allocated. A total of 59,115 piculs and 4.5 dou of rice were collected at 3.1 million yuan, and 16,703 piculs and 0.9 dou of rice were collected at 2.5 million yuan, totaling 213,882,639,000 yuan in legal tender. The total amount of rice collected so far is 478,156,702,465 yuan. In terms of edible oil, 294 barrels of edible oil (each barrel weighing 360 catties net) were issued last week, bringing the total number of barrels issued to 12,789. A total of 61,170,511,950 yuan in oil payments were collected last week.

### Rice Market Sentiment Turns Firm; Japonica and Indica Rice Rise Together; Premium Japonica Rises to 4.15 Million Yuan

The rice market turned upward. The opening price in the morning continued the firm momentum of the closing price on the previous day. In addition, Wuxi quoted a higher price, and the Food Distribution Committee may purchase the remaining rice, so the public sentiment unanimously turned active, and the price rose by 100,000 yuan. Japonica paddy and Indica rice and glutinous rice in the South Market all rose by 100,000 yuan. The North Market was even more firm, with Japonica paddy and Japonica Indica, etc., all rising by 150,000 yuan. Premium Japonica rose to 4.15 million yuan, and Baiyuan rose by 200,000 yuan to 4.1 million yuan. The Food Distribution Committee sold white rice at a maximum price of 3.65 million yuan. Yesterday's arrivals were 1,794 piculs in the South Market and 3,266 piculs in the North Market.

Flour has been quiet for a long time and is thinking of moving. Yesterday, because the demand from the North gangs was stronger, the holders were very firm in raising prices. Bingchuan flour opened at 1.42 million yuan. Midway, the North gangs bought in a lot, and it rose all the way to 1.45 million yuan. At the close, floating goods were released, and it fell back to 1.43 million yuan, a rise of 20,000 yuan. Lao Che closed at 1.435 million yuan, up 35,000 yuan. Hong Feng and Jiancheng each gained 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The trading of miscellaneous brands turned active. Bran was similar to the previous day, and flour mills raised the bid price by 50,000 yuan.

Coarse grains generally turned flat. Because bean cake oil rose more the day before, soybeans rose by 50,000 yuan. Corn fell back by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum was flat and weak, and selected green sorghum turned weak by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Tea beans continued to be accepted by the north and south gangs, and they rose by another 100,000+ yuan alone. The authorities intervened in sesame, limiting the increase to 100,000 yuan, ostensibly flat but secretly firm. The authorities also inquired about the reasons for the rise in raw peanuts, and the public sentiment was very uncertain, resulting in a sharp decline of nearly 1 million yuan.

The edible oil market hovered in the early market and eventually reported a decline. In the morning market, the holders still wanted to call for higher prices, but the entrants were afraid of the high prices and hesitated to move forward. Although the early market was high, the later market turned down by 50,000 yuan. Datong Soybean Oil Factory opened at 8.85 million yuan and closed at 8.8 million yuan. Raw oil fell by 100,000 yuan, and Jiangbei Ji Barrel Raw Oil fell back to 10 million yuan. There was no trading on the clear oil market.

There were more trades in soybean cake futures. Yesterday, because the rumors of foreign exchange did not materialize, retail investors frequently released, and finally fell by 30,000 yuan.

### Taiwan Sugar Initially Tight, Then Soft

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially tight and then soft, with ups and downs ranging from 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. As the New Taiwan dollar and allocation prices increased at the same time, the market had already heard the news and risen first. Yesterday, the market rose again, and actual sales inevitably stalled, so the later market unanimously turned small.

Spot No. 24 coarse white was initially 5.85 million yuan, then fell back to 6.8 million yuan, a slight increase of 80,000 yuan from the previous day. No. 45 white was 6.5 million to 6.4 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan. Straw bags were 6.4 million to 6.35 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan.

### Multiple Parties Closing Positions; Chinese Stocks Rebound

Chinese stocks suddenly moved in reverse and fell sharply yesterday. The listed prices did not change, the money supply tightened, and the prices of goods fell, forcing multiple parties to close positions en masse. Several miscellaneous stocks fell to the limit.

The morning opening was weak because people were concerned about the upcoming inquiry into state-owned enterprises and treasury bonds. Yongsha opened at 2,095 yuan and was sold to 2,030 yuan. Although Nos. 56, 14, and 116 advanced to 2,050 yuan, Nos. 179, etc. were sold. The agency fee opened high at 20 yuan and 23 yuan, and fell back to 1,965 yuan. After buying in to 1,990 yuan, the market rebounded outside the industry. The money supply tightened greatly, and it fell again to 1,930 yuan. Although No. 61, etc. took advantage of the low price to advance to 1,950 yuan, the selling continued and the low price reached 1,890 yuan. Huaxin and Xinyi fell to the limit. The noon closing was 1,905 yuan. Except for Xinyi, which fell to the limit, Rongfeng fell by half a percent. Yongsha, Huaxin, Zhongfa, Xinyi, Xinhe, Qinxing, Yonggong, Tongyi, Jinglun, Huochai, Lian, Zhongsi, Shangwu, and Zhabei fell by 10 percent. Xinhua Guohuo fell by 15 percent.

The market was slightly stable in the afternoon. Yongsha opened at 1,950 yuan and was sold to 1,920 yuan. Nos. 119, etc. all advanced. Trading was once stagnant. The national banks did not intervene much, and it once rebounded to a high price of 1,975 yuan. The closing price fell back to 1,942 yuan. Huaxin reported another fall to the limit. Compared with the morning closing price, Huaxin fell to the limit, Hengfeng shrank by a little over 10 percent, Rongfeng fell slightly, Lian and Yonggong were still flat, and the rest rose slightly. Various unlisted stocks in the off-market market all reported slight declines.

### Government Bonds Stable; Foreign Stocks Weak

Government bonds were stable yesterday. Series C opened at 111,000, and fell from 113,000 to close at 105,000. About 4 million yuan was traded. Compared with the previous closing price, Series A and B were still flat, Series C and E were lower by 2 yuan, and Series D fell by 1,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks were forced by tight money to sell actively yesterday. There was no shortage of rebounds outside the circle, which was extremely unfavorable midway. However, with the help of Hong Kong Electric Power and news, it was slightly stable in the end. Jardine Matheson opened at 2.85 million in the morning, rising to 2.87 million, and fell back to 2.74 million. In the end, it was slightly firm, struggling around 2.8 million. As a result, Steel Corporation fell by 10 percent compared with the previous closing price. Jardine Matheson, Jardine Matheson Spinning and Weaving, and Paper Edition each fell by a little less than half a percent, and the rest fell slightly.

### Foreign Tea Traders Firm

In yesterday's foreign tea market, exporters continued to inquire about 1947 Pingshui pearl tea, but the holders' minds were still optimistic and they were reluctant to part with it. As a result of the discussions between the two parties, there was no progress, and transactions remained narrow, but the potential remained firm. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, since the real needs of the Tianjin gangs have turned sluggish, the market is currently only relying on the dissipation of goods in this street and in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, so the market is still not lonely. In terms of prices, this year's new goods have become softened in the presence of more arrivals and active supply. However, various old teas are consistently firm and energetic due to the depletion of stocks.

### Local Business Conditions

Guangzhou [Our Newspaper Guangzhou 20th] The rising trend in the financial market here has stabilized slightly. The Hong Kong dollar hovers around 133, and gold is 4,530. However, rice prices continue to rise unabated. The public is panicking. The Provincial Field Grain Office is currently selling stored grain in succession to stabilize grain prices.

Hangzhou [Our Newspaper Hangzhou 20th] The Hangzhou silk market is rising wildly, and transactions are frequent. Prices are called out without any standards. Factory silk rose sharply to 390 million, dried cocoons closed at 300 million, and artificial silk showed firm intention to rise sharply. Rice, with production areas still firm, has risen more than it has fallen in the Hangzhou market, with machine-milled rice reporting 370,000.

### Tangible Sales Thin, Sparse, and Much Vomiting; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Both See Sharp Declines; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Plummets 5 Million Compared to the Previous Day

Yesterday, in the yarn market, rumors of a rise in foreign exchange rates had been circulating for days, but this did not materialize yesterday, causing sentiment to turn negative. Furthermore, tangible sales were thin and sparse, and the local market was also weak. The market experienced a comprehensive decline yesterday. At the opening, all grades started low, with 42-count Blue Phoenix immediately breaking the 240 million mark. Subsequently, due to retail investors releasing their holdings and those with short positions taking the opportunity to sell, market prices entered a sluggish trajectory, once falling to 234 million. Near closing, there was a slight rebound, ultimately closing at 245 million, a drop of 5 million compared to the previous day. The trend for 21-count Double Horse became increasingly unsustainable, opening at 157 million in the morning and falling to 151 million, a sharp drop of 13 million. Other grades all experienced general declines ranging from 3.5 million to 7 million.

Cotton cloth advanced rapidly and retreated sharply yesterday. New longs from the previous day competed to sell, with industry insiders selling successively due to unbearable interest burdens. Buyers held back, and retail investors took the opportunity to sell short. Each cloth was down more than 200,000 yuan from its peak, while cloth from private factories tended to stabilize. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached as high as 5.17 million yuan, ultimately closing at 4.94 million, and finally at 4.91 million yuan. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company offered 37 types of cotton cloth and 2 types of bedsheets for sale. Blue Chicken fine cloth was priced at 4.53 million yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Piji at 4.62 million yuan, with few applicants.

Textile Construction Sells Cloth

Applicants were extremely enthusiastic, with a total of 609 applications. 28,860 bolts of cotton cloth and 320 bedsheets were sold. Except for 10 factory applications, purchasing 2,480 bolts of cloth, all were purchased by cloth merchants.

Spot Cotton Rises

Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to rise. Supply from traders was scarce, and the market's inventory was depleted. Bids were repeatedly raised, with all grades rising by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, as cotton yarn advanced rapidly and retreated sharply, sentiment softened slightly. The Flower Management Committee took this opportunity to raise purchase prices along with the market. Cargo owners sold at the highs, and trading became more active, with about 1,000 bales changing hands. The prices for delivery to the public treasury were: Chongming flower at 19 million, Hankou fine velvet at 22 million, and Jingyang at 24.7 million, with 700 bales traded.

The noon close fell further to 236 million yuan. The afternoon continued to be weak, and the closing price was 235 million yuan for the selling price.

The factory silk market initially showed firmness yesterday, but soon declined, ultimately being slightly weaker than the previous day. High Zero Load opened at 380 million yuan at the highest in the morning, and 60 million yuan at the lowest in the afternoon. There were no transactions for each grade of five-load goods. Various factories were unwilling to sell because loan measures had not yet been decided. Dry warp stocks were very depleted, and the price of silk in the countryside was very high, so the asking price for High Zero Load reached 320 million yuan in the morning, but there were no transactions.

The silk market rose and then fell yesterday. Huaqiang real silk quilt covers rose to 156 million yuan at the opening in the morning, reaching a maximum of 157 million yuan. Later, it was heard that the stock market was frequently falling, raw materials were declining, and sentiment gradually weakened. The closing price fell to 149 million yuan.

### Tea Merchants Provide Opinions on This Year's Tea Loan Business

Tea is one of China's important exports. The government's tea loan business for this year has already had a detailed plan drafted by the Farmers Bank of China, which will be approved at the board meeting to be held tomorrow (the 22nd) at the Four Banks Joint Office. According to the consolidated opinions of the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association of China Tea Association, the First and Second District Tea Making Association, and the Shanghai Tea Merchants Association: (1) The total cost of production funds for export tea this year is estimated to be 10% self-funded by tea merchants and 90% government-loaned. (2) Regarding the government loan portion, please consider the actual needs and make appropriate changes to the 36th year's method. That is, the tea loan for this year should be changed to be issued in four phases, and distributed according to the total cost ratio as follows: 1. The first phase loans 40% for the purchase of raw tea (combined with the tea merchant's self-funded 10% for a total of 50%). 2. The second phase loans 20% for processing. 3. The third phase loans 10% for transportation. 4. The fourth phase loans 20% for mortgage (that is, handled according to 90% of the total cost). (3) The mortgage loan period is set at three months. If the market is stagnant or the export price cannot meet the requirements, it can be extended by two months. If necessary, the government may be requested to purchase all of it to protect the legitimate profits of tea merchants. (4) The interest on mortgage tea is calculated at 3% according to the precedent of the 36th year, and tea merchants are allowed to provide joint guarantees from two firms in the same industry. It is estimated that the tea production volume in each region this year can reach 253,000 piculs (the total output of Oolong and Taiwan red tea in Taiwan Province is equal to this number), including 22,000 piculs of Qimen black tea, 35,000 piculs of Tunxi green tea, 15,000 piculs of Wuyuan green tea, 8,000 piculs of green tea from Suian, Chun'an, and Kaihua, 75,000 piculs of Pingshui green tea, 7,000 piculs of Wenzhou black tea, 7,000 piculs of Wenzhou green tea, 10,000 piculs of Ningzhou black tea, 3,000 piculs of Hekou black tea, 5,000 piculs of Yushan green tea, 25,000 piculs of Fujian black tea, 15,000 piculs of Fujian green tea, 20,000 piculs of Hunan black tea, and 5,000 piculs of Hubei black tea.

### Reader's Mailbox: Bargaining is Common; Unexpectedly, Large Bills Become Small Notes

A Reader Reports Being Cheated

To the Editor of Shen Bao: I am a department store merchant, with a shop on North Henan Road. At around 2:00 PM on April 16th, a person wearing a dark-colored coat, an old-fashioned western suit, a duckbill hat, and pockmarks on his face came to my store to purchase goods in bulk, totaling 11 million yuan. The person placed a bundle of cash, totaling 10 million yuan, on the counter. My apprentice Xing Xue checked the cash and found no shortage. I said to the person that the price of the goods was 11 million yuan, and paying 10 million yuan now was too far off, and the transaction could not be completed. The person then bundled up the cash and put it in a bag. However, as he approached the door, he turned back and entered, saying that he would reduce the purchase of Panda men's socks by three dozen, so that the deal could be done. I thought there was still a small profit of 100,000 yuan to be made in this kind of business, so I agreed. Who knew that later it was discovered that the cash he had paid had already been switched, the outer packaging was the same, but the inside was all small notes of 50 yuan and 100 yuan, so I lost money. This kind of swindler has clever methods and is very easy to fool. I hope you will allow me to disclose this, so that all industries will be wary, so that the treacherous schemes will not succeed. Sincerely, Huang Mianqian

### The Vicissitudes of Life, Another Spring

— Zhao Qingge

One, The Shadow of Tai Lake

Bearing a slight illness, I went to Wuxi, partly because I had long admired the scenery of Tai Lake but had never experienced it personally; partly because I wanted to alleviate the depression that had been suffocating me for months.

My admiration for Tai Lake dates back more than ten years. I remember that my first multi-act play, "Heroine," was based on the story of Cai Jinhua, a female outlaw hero of Tai Lake. At that time, I wrote it in Beibei Hot Springs in Sichuan. Because of this play, I often yearned for the magnificence and splendor of Tai Lake; and because of Cai Jinhua, I often fantasized about the many extraordinary heroes of Tai Lake. Therefore, my recent film script "Good Daughter of the Green Forest" still has Tai Lake as its backdrop.

I dreamed that one day, I would also become a hero of Tai Lake!

With what fervent emotions I embarked on the journey, as if longing to throw myself into the embrace of a lover I had long known in spirit!

When I jumped off the train, I found that the smoke and clouds here covered the sun, and my heart began to feel lost and gloomy.

It took a lot of effort to find a place to stay. Every hotel had a "Full" sign, and everyone was flocking to Tai Lake as if they were crazy.

At just past four o'clock, it was already a foggy dusk. A friend drove a jeep to accompany me and Hui to visit Meiyuan Park. — Meiyuan Park, this is another place I have long missed, because I love plum blossoms.

My first impression was that the city of Wuxi had none of the characteristics of a scenic area. It was purely an industrial area, noisy and dirty; there was not a single tree or blade of grass on the streets. Once out of the city, the road was bumpy and uneven, and my ribs almost cracked! I couldn't see half a wildflower in the fields.

Walking and walking, when we arrived at Meiyuan Park, the sky became even gloomier, just like me, carrying a bit of illness.

Apart from a grove of plum trees, there was nothing worthwhile here. However, the plum trees were densely packed, and only a few remaining red petals were left, with fallen petals forming a阵, only adding to the desolate feeling! I dared not linger, and stepped onto the shady path. The rain was misty, like tears flowing into my heart! Passing through a stone cave, climbing to a high peak for a distant view, I only caught a glimpse of the spring scenery of the lake and mountains, just like the realm in my dream. I wanted to feast on this scene, but I was soaked to the bone, so I had to leave in a hurry.

A torrential rain poured down all night. The next day, I was in low spirits and unwilling to linger any longer, so I embarked on the return journey in the afternoon.

Back in Shanghai, the rain had cleared and the sky was clear, and my illness had also improved, but Tai Lake only left me with an unpleasant shadow.

Two, The Bright Sun of Gusu

Fourteen years ago, I went to Suzhou in the summer to sketch and paint; two years ago, I came again in the autumn to visit the old scenic spots; this spring is my third visit. The people are different, and the mood is different! But each time it gave me a good impression. I once wrote "Small and Exquisite Suzhou," explaining my love for Suzhou's leisure and tranquility, and my love for Suzhou's smallness and exquisiteness.

The car arrived in Suzhou, and went straight to a hotel outside the 葑門 to stay. The hotel was so quiet that even the sound of a cat meowing could not be heard. The next morning, I was awakened by the birds singing in the small courtyard. This small courtyard had several peach trees and several holly bushes. I got up and changed the air in the small courtyard, and my mind was refreshed.

At noon, Hui and I went into the city to visit Xuanmiao Temple and ate some Suzhou-style snacks. Then we went to Lion Grove Garden to enjoy tea. However, there were too many tourists, and all I could see was the movement of people's heads instead of mountains and rivers. It was a bit of a nuisance! So we left after a short sit and went to Humble Administrator's Garden.

Humble Administrator's Garden is now the campus of the Social Education College. It happened to be spring break, and the students were all out playing. Several friends were teaching here, but I didn't want to disturb them, so I casually strolled around for a week. Here, I fully appreciated the beauty of the bright spring. The lotus pond had already sprouted, and the willows on both sides hung upside down on the water. Crossing the winding bridge, there was a shady path. Stepping on the mossy stone path, I searched for traces of dreams. A row of pink walls lay in front of me, and then another green mountain road. The rows of peach trees beside the road were full of bright red flowers, with multiple layers of petals, like small roses, without any feeling of "ill fate." There were also three or five crabapple trees interspersed among them, diluting the rich spring colors, making the mood of the whole garden more detached and beautiful. Hui and I lingered and forgot to return, hesitating in front of the flowers for a long time.

At this point, Hui—a person who often lived in Suzhou—finally admitted that Suzhou was indeed lovely, and she had discovered such a good place in Suzhou for the first time.

Tired of traveling until late at night, I bought drunk at the famous liquor store Yuantai Chang, and discussed the壶 while drinking with my companions. I was so happy for a while that I unknowingly drank four catties of yellow soup! So I was drunk and extremely embarrassed! Back at the hotel, I vomited all night, which made Hui work hard to support me. When I woke up the next afternoon, my head was heavy and my feet were light, as if after a serious illness, and I was extremely tired. I lay in bed all day, reflecting on myself, and I was very annoyed, because although the heroic spirit remained, my capacity was not what it used to be!

On the third day, my spirit and physical strength recovered, so I led Hui and Brother Dongping to climb Tiger Hill, visit Xiyuan Temple, and enter Lingering Garden. The sun was warm and the wind was gentle, and my mood was also relaxed and happy.

Tiger Hill was also crowded and noisy. Xiyuan Temple was not as quiet. The fish in the Xiyuan Temple's liberation pond were large, but unfortunately the water was turbid and difficult to see. You have to use steamed buns to lure them out of the water. A pavilion was built in the center of the pool, with curved bridges on both ends. The old willows at the bridgehead were interesting. The stone caves were winding, unlike the carvings in Lion Grove Garden. There was a temple outside the garden, and the monks were unbearably vulgar. They used the excuse of repairing the golden bodies of the five hundred Arhats to extort donations, and when refused, they were scolded, which was completely devoid of the compassion of a Bodhisattva.

Many of the buildings in Lingering Garden were demolished, and the walls were covered with drawings of Japanese soldiers practicing. It seems that it was used as a garrison by the enemy during the occupation. After the victory, the local authorities should have repaired it slightly, but the officials only knew how to love fame and wealth and did not know how to love the scenery. As a result, the beautiful garden remained barren and desolate, which was heartbreaking!

Only a small pond of smelly water remained, with a few duckweeds rippling, showing a sense of bleakness and depression. There were also small bridges; there were also stone caves; there were also rockeries; only trees and flowers were missing. Therefore, I could not smell the breath of spring here, just like two years ago, when I wandered in the bleak autumn.

Leaving Lingering Garden, spring was revived! We stepped on the fields, crossed one piece of broad bean garden after another, and our steps echoed the chirping of the birds in the sky, rhythmically walking towards the city of Suzhou.

When the setting sun hung on the foot of the Tiger Hill Pagoda, I said goodbye to my friends; said goodbye to paradise; carrying a body full of dust; a heart full of joy; and eyes full of spring colors; and returned to the noisy sea. (April 12, 1937)

### Art Review Child Stars Paint Bamboo

— Zhu Yingpeng

Professor Tongxingmen is an old friend of thirty years ago. I didn't know he could paint until recently, when I learned that he was good at painting bamboo, which was passed down from his family. From his great-great-grandfather, his family has engaged in the art for four generations.

He once talked to me about the principles of painting bamboo, and felt that the variety of bamboo and the beauty of bamboo postures were best found in the southwest. The bamboo in the south of the Yangtze River was not worth mentioning. His bamboo paintings mostly take realism, so there are some with very long bamboo trunks and sparse branches and leaves, which is what he saw in the southwest; and some with bird nests painted on bamboo, which is what he saw in Burma. It turns out that there are many snakes in Burma. To avoid snakes, birds do not nest in trees but in bamboo, which those who have not seen it personally do not know. He also talked about the upward and downward direction of bamboo leaves, which is due to the different names of bamboo and has nothing to do with sunny or rainy weather. It is not accurate to commonly regard drooping leaves as rainy bamboo.

He also talked about landscape paintings, believing that all the ancient mountain stone wrinkle methods, such as hemp fiber, axe splitting, and lotus leaves, all came from the real scenes seen with the eyes. First see the mountain and then have the wrinkle method, not first have the wrinkle method and then paint the mountain. The wrinkles of mountain rocks are entirely related to geology. Therefore, it should not be said that a certain wrinkle method belongs to a certain family; it should be said that it belongs to geography. Similarly, the various trees in landscape paintings also have geographical relationships. If you use the lotus leaf wrinkle method to create the scenery of the south of the Yangtze River, or use tortuous trees to embellish the scenery of the northwest, it is inevitably close to a joke.

Art cannot be separated from science, just as science cannot be separated from art. I have always held this view. Now I see that Yijun's research on painting bamboo and landscapes can grasp the physical and geographical basis, and he is truly a rare person among his peers.

### Renfeng's Painting Exhibition

— Fan Quan

Among friends in the art world, everyone knows that Renfeng is a woodcut artist, but after seeing this exhibition, we know that the author is also a Chinese painter and a Western painter.

Looking at the works exhibited at the Daxin Gallery this time, we feel that there are several unusual and noteworthy features: First, in terms of the subject matter of all the works, the author uses the things of the lower strata of society as the theme. For example, "For Survival," "Suing the Landlord," and "Selling a Child" in woodcuts, "Vendors," "Fengyang Flower Drum," "Mother and Daughter Sewing for the Poor," "Shoemaker," "Itinerant Medicine Seller" in Chinese paintings, "Group Portrait" in Yongmo paintings, and "Blind Child," "Spinster," and "Mountain Family" in sketches, and so on. This artistic creation tendency is no different from opening up a new path that painters in the past have not taken. This is a gratifying phenomenon. Second, in terms of the composition of the works, the author's understanding of human anatomy is very profound, so that the various compositions he completes based on sketches are not only powerful and clear, with no wasted ink, but also create figures that look even more lifelike. It is precisely because of the author's profound understanding of human anatomy that the author is able to complete the third feature, which is: the versatility of expression methods. The author can use woodcut knives, ink or colored inks, and even oil painting brushes to express the same subject matter appropriately. The author not only focuses on "specialization," but also takes care of "breadth." Such efforts and achievements are also unmatched by ordinary painters.

### Pond

— Lv Feng

Green duckweed floats up, in pieces, in pieces, with very small area and volume. If you look at it from a distance, you can't see their roundness: where there is green duckweed, it looks like grass, and where there is no green duckweed, it looks like glass. The pond has changed its appearance!

The clear sky and branches are upside down on it, and it also embraces the long willow branches. Tourists and babies, groups of girls, and occasionally one or two small birds, as well as children's strollers that are painted very brightly, many shadows are all in the pond...

The pond in spring is a pond that has awakened. It is fertile and green, with strong 生侖 pigments. However, the most wonderful thing is that the shadows it collects still retain their original colors, which is different from the shadows anywhere else! So praises, exclamations, and children's screams all fall into this pond in spring.

It is really too beautiful, and the old man watching the pond has also forgotten to prohibit the children's naughty behavior: let fruit peels be thrown into the pond, let stones be thrown into the pond, let candy wrappers be rubbed into rice-like paper balls and thrown into the pond, let branches and leaves and the grass growing by the pond all be thrown into the pond... Therefore, can you say that he is a derelict old man, and mercilessly reprimand him, this is obviously a mistake.

Really, you can only say that spring is too beautiful. It beautifies the pond and beautifies everything by the pond. (April 12, Wenmiao)

### Reverie on a Sailing Boat

— Jiang Xingyu

This is an empty return boat. Except for the camphor wood boxes and Nanfeng oranges piled in the bottom cabin, there are fewer than thirty passengers and crew members.

All I can see is the very low visibility of the severe winter sky, flocks of geese that appear from time to time on the horizon, turbid and restless river water, tall and lonely masts that seem to have pierced the sky, and thick and thin ropes crisscrossing. All I can hear is the sound of a whistle once or twice.

Sometimes the embankment is close enough to count the number of floors of the pagoda on the bank, and sometimes it is far enough to only vaguely see some blurry gray shadows, making you strain your spirit to guess where are the trees? Where are the houses? Where is the pasture? Sometimes it is even farther, and even the blurry gray shadows are almost imperceptible.

Suppose you are the boat and the other party is the embankment, isn't this situation just like love? Sometimes she allows you to hold her hand and take a walk on a secluded path, sometimes she always frowns when she sees you, always saying "I have a terrible headache," sometimes you want to get a little news from her, which is a thousand times more difficult than climbing to heaven. The only difference is that the boat will eventually approach the embankment, and there are as many people whose love has no destination throughout their lives as there are sands in the Ganges.

I often stare at the two banks in the pilot house with binoculars. Due to the physical effect of these two pieces of glass, distant scenery becomes near, and scenery that is originally near becomes even closer. Of course, in fact, the distance between me and the embankment has not decreased by a single point. I have met many people who use illusions or hallucinations to replace the facts that they have no courage to admit. You find an environment or a reason to deceive yourself and satisfy yourself. You can preserve the bedroom furnishings of a relative who has died in a foreign land, believing that he will one day come back alive. Even if your lover has already formed a fairly happy family with someone else, you can believe that she still misses you day and night. I don't object to any of this. It's too bitter for people to insist on not being self-satisfied and self-deceiving.

Like the crisscrossing ropes on the boat, I thought of these things in my heart without any order. I wanted to learn the calmness of that mast, but I couldn't suppress my reverie.

### Court Ladies

### Sea Whisper Eight Lines

— Liao Xiaofan

The letter you gave me,

Won't make me sad,

You said you don't love me anymore,

But the letter is quite long.

Twelve pages of regular script small characters,

How tight and delicate,

No lover who is about to leave,

Would write in such detail.

### Yangzhou Bathhouse

— Hong Weifa

—Yangzhou Continued Dreams, Twenty-seven

The author once said in the article "Tea Drinkers": "It is commonly said that the people of Yangzhou love 'skin wrapped in water in the morning, and water wrapped in skin in the evening.' 'Skin wrapped in water' refers to going to a tea house to drink tea, and 'water wrapped in skin' refers to going to a bathhouse to bathe." Regarding the matter of "skin wrapped in water," it has been mentioned many times, and now I will talk about "water wrapped in skin."

Perhaps because the people of Yangzhou love "water wrapped in skin in the evening," the bathhouses in Yangzhou seem to be more numerous than elsewhere. The Records of Painted Boats says: "The fashion of bathhouses began with Guo Tang in Shaobo Town. Later, Zhang Tang outside Xuning Gate followed suit. Zhang in the city followed its system in Xingjiao Temple to compete. Therefore, it was the same inside and outside the four cities. For example, Xiaopenglai at Kaiming Bridge, Baiyu Pond at Taiping Bridge, Luosiding at Quekoumen, Tao Tang at Xuningdou, Baisha Spring at Guangchumen, Xiaoshanyuan at Gengzishang, Qingying Spring at Beihexia, and Guanglingtao at Dongguan, each reached its peak. Outside the city, Gu Tang in Tanxiang and Xinfeng Spring in Beimen Street were the most famous." Some of these names of bathhouses that "each reached its peak" are still retained today, but times have changed, and the past and the present cannot be compared.

First, let's talk about the pool. The Records of Painted Boats records: "And use white stone as the pool, more than a square zhang, divided into several large and small grids. The large one near the carved hot water is the large pool, the next is the medium pool, and the small one with not very hot water is the baby pool." The names of the large pool, medium pool, and baby pool were no longer heard in the author's childhood. All that was known were the first pool, the second pool, and the third pool, and the third pool was larger than the second pool, and the second pool was larger than the first pool. It must be because the baby pool is warm water, which is convenient for ordinary bathers, not just limited to babies, so the name had to be changed, and the area also had to be expanded. The first pool, which was "close to carved hot water," was not needed by everyone, so naturally its scope was reduced under the principle of supply and demand.

Next, let's talk about the seats. The Records of Painted Boats records: "The imitation clothes, arranged around the hall, are called seat compartments, and those on both sides are called standing compartments. The inside leads to a small room, called a warm room. After tea, fragrance, and wine, the waiter breaks off branches and massages, which is extremely luxurious." The so-called standing compartments could still be seen in the author's childhood, and most of their customers were coolies. In addition, the seat compartments were better, and the warm rooms were even more comfortable. Jushi Baisha Xing'an's Yangzhou Hao Baidiao wrote: "Yangzhou is good: bathing has a pool attendant. Those who support and follow the body act as crutches, and those who stroke the body make the guest forget fatigue, and the fragrant tea沁心脾!" This also refers to some customers in the warm rooms. These customers often have fixed "pool attendants." Whenever they take a bath, the fixed "pool attendant" will hold them in and out of the bath, and will be familiar with their customer's habits, such as how hot the feet should be, how to scrub the back, how long to stay in the pool, and whether they like hot water or not, and they will arrange everything properly so that the customer is comfortable, which is of course an "extremely luxurious" thing.

Furthermore, let's talk about customs. The Records of Painted Boats records: "Men enter the bath the night before the wedding, which costs dozens of gold. Bathing on New Year's Eve is called washing away the old, and bathing on the Dragon Boat Festival is called hundred herb water." The customs of "washing away the old" and washing "hundred herb water" still exist in small bathhouses today, but large and new bathhouses no longer have these names. As for spending money to bathe before the wedding, it is no longer seen today, but the author encountered it in his childhood. Because when the bridegroom enters the bath, someone always accompanies him, and he has to put on a new set of so-called "wedding clothes." Everyone sees and knows this, and the attendants and others will take the opportunity to ask for wedding money, and "dozens of gold" are spent in this way. In addition, there are customs that the author experienced in his childhood but no longer exist today. At the entrance of every bathhouse, there is a large "忍" (ren, meaning "endurance") written on the white wall facing you. Also, when every child first enters the bath, the adult leading him will bring a few "Shunzhi" coins and throw them into the pool. Later, Shunzhi coins became difficult to find, so copper coins were used instead. The meaning of writing "忍" is very puzzling. Some say that this is because everyone in the bath is "袒裼裸裎" (tan xi lu cheng, meaning "naked"), and collisions are inevitable. If you get angry, from cursing to fighting, the pool skin is hot, and the outside of the pool is eternally slippery, it is very easy to cause danger. Therefore, when customers enter the door, they are made to see the word "忍" so as to raise their awareness. As for children throwing copper coins when they first enter the bath, perhaps the intention is to seek good luck. Originally, the Chinese believed in polytheism, thinking that there were gods everywhere, and the bath also had gods in charge. Although bribery was rampant, it was precisely seeking their blessing!

### Masaryk's Mood

— Xuanxuan

Recently, I read Xiao Qian's imitation "The Will of Masaryk" in "Observer." It is written "vividly" enough. If it is considered a literary work, that's fine, but I think the author will never admit that it was written and published as a literary work. What the author wants to express is a kind of thought or position that represents the author, precisely borrowing Masaryk's mouth to say his own words.

Mr. Xiao Qian mainly said that Masaryk was confident that he was a friend of democracy, and confident that the two kinds of democratic societies, "new" and "old," could coexist peacefully. He not only wanted to see the coordination of the two democracies, but also wanted to act as a bridge between them. But after all, he was "unfit to leave his native land for long." After seven or eight years, he finally "broke away" from Czechoslovakia. For a muddled liberation, he could only destroy himself.

Mr. Xiao's article, as I said, is written quite "vividly," but not truthfully. Masaryk did dream of coordination between the East and the West, but his dream was ultimately shattered by reality. After the dream was shattered, he had to think about his future. In Czechoslovakia, he represented the link between Czechoslovakia and the so-called Western world, that is to say, his relationship with Britain and the United States was so close that without him, the Western world would lose Czechoslovakia. This point was seen as very important by a part of the Czech people, and it was also seen as very important by Masaryk himself. But democratic countries like Britain and the United States did not value the longing of a weak friend in the distance. They only valued him by the pound, completely with the face of a businessman, only paying attention to the value of the goods, but not paying attention to the relationship between people. In the years of exile, Masaryk tasted this kind of bitterness to the full.

The peace he dreamed of did not come, not only did it not come, but the situation reached a stage where he had to make a decisive decision. If he did not cooperate with the newly emerging force of the Czech Communists, he would have to go into exile again, but the taste of exile was bitter after all: living under someone else's roof, looking at their faces, fearing that he would be of no use to others. He had tasted that kind of taste enough, so he dared not taste it again.

Under the tension of thinking during the day and losing sleep at night, he accepted the post of Foreign Minister of the Czech Communist government. He thought: I have been a foreign minister for so many years, and now Czechoslovakia is still Czechoslovakia. Accepting this position of foreign minister is not shameful.

But he always felt uncomfortable, unsuitable, and unable to get along with them, and he didn't know why. In fact, it was his education and social background that made it impossible for him to adapt to this fateful new environment, no matter how "enlightened" you wanted to be. So he thought back and forth, distressed and in pain.

If he had greater confidence in his Western friends, he would be willing to go into exile again, but no. He understood best the difficulty of a weak person begging for food from a strong person. Thinking again that he was old and had seen enough of the vicissitudes of life, he didn't want to go abroad again to suffer the wind and dew and be bossed around. People of a certain age generally don't like to move around. He wanted to relive the good dreams of his childhood and cherish everything of the past, so he decided to stay.

But he also understood what role he was playing in this new environment. He was proud. After thinking about it for so many days, he felt that there was only one way to die. Just like famous generals and beauties, they leave the stage before they are old, giving people a good impression forever. I think Masaryk committed suicide in this mood.

To say that his suicide was only to resolve a psychological contradiction is incorrect. His suicide was a protest! A protest against the suppression of irresistible forces, which also meant non-cooperation. On the other hand, his suicide was a warning, warning some hypocritical people that he did not have much hope for them. Because he had been there, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment might be.

Masaryk's death was a tragedy of the times, almost a destiny. With Masaryk's thoughts and position, in this environment, to be cruel, death might have been the most appropriate way for him to deal with himself. What should be reflected on and understood deeply is the group of people who claim to be Masaryk's friends. How much help did they give him and the ideas he represented? Is the motive for helping beyond reproach? Half of his death was forced by you!

This may be a more approximate explanation. That's what I think.

### Aftermath of Jinshan

— Qiaoling

Jinshan Temple, in a moment of carelessness on the peaceful and sunny sixth day of April, saw its essence reduced to ashes. The fire started in the storage room, spreading to the abbot's residence, the Sutra Repository, the Jade Buddha Hall, the Great Buddha Hall, and the reception room, etc. Only the Dharma Cave, the Guanyin Pavilion, and the seven-story pagoda remained unharmed. Due to the terrain, the fire brigade was helpless, managing only to save the mountain gate. However, the number of tourists not only did not decrease but actually increased, as everyone wanted to pay respects to this famous site after the disaster. Looking from the front of the mountain gate, the tourists were bustling and crowded, with no sign of the fire. After entering the gate, all that could be seen was rubble, a few withered trees, and steps that crumbled underfoot. The surrounding fire walls were tottering and about to collapse, causing anxiety. In front of the Great Buddha Hall, an incense tripod remained intact, and tourists sighed as they touched it. In addition, two or three tourists bent over in front of the walls of the Great Hall, as if searching for something, as it was rumored that there were priceless treasures hidden in the Buddhist statues. Behind the Great Hall, the Jade Buddha in the Jade Buddha Hall was broken, and the tiles were incomplete. Withered trees lay across the floor of the Sutra Repository, with the remaining scriptures, scorched by fire and stained with water, exposed to the sunlight. Some tourists said that a disciple of the abbot had warned of the disaster in advance and taught a method to avoid it, but it was not adopted, which is absurd and unfounded. The Jinshan incident was due to human error, for the following reasons: (1) The storage room contained a large amount of flammable materials such as petroleum and coal, and the ventilation was poor, so it could ignite spontaneously without a flame, which is easily predictable to those with scientific knowledge. (2) Lack of fire prevention equipment: The incident occurred during the day, and if there had been fire prevention equipment, it would not have been difficult to extinguish once discovered. (3) The buildings were adjacent and easily spread the fire. The Dharma Cave, Guanyin Pavilion, and Pagoda were not affected because they were far away from other buildings. (4) The fire started on the hillside, and the fire engines could not exert their power. Human planning was lacking, leading to the disaster of a famous site, which is regrettable. During my visit, a monk suddenly came, wearing a tattered robe and worn-out sandals, greeted me and asked: "Jinshan has been burned, what can you do?" He laughed as he spoke. I was surprised by his appearance and casually replied: "Ask the Buddha!" Someone knowledgeable told me: "This is a mad monk." So I took a few photos, felt disappointed and returned, and as I left and looked back, the Maitreya Buddha inside the mountain gate was still smiling in the setting sun.

### The Spirit of Zhushui

— Haiyan

Regardless of how much the thoughts of Mr. Confucius were used by later emperors and rulers to suppress the people, Confucius himself was innocent and meritorious. He lived in a feudal era (in the narrow sense), and also an era of the gradual collapse of the feudal system. His propositions were precisely suited to the time. Later rulers obliterated his spirit of "being timely," attempting to "apply them to all ages," which had their own ulterior motives.

But his spirit of "education for all," is, in any case, a great idea. Although the rigid adherence to scholarship following him certainly hindered progress, the educational spirit, the great spirit of an educator with three thousand disciples, is still worthy of emulation by today's educators. But naturally, the wind of Zhushui and the scene of Apricot Altar over the years, can never be created by professors from the highest institutions in Beiping who cannot afford a bag of cheap flour and must weigh every ounce of flour to eat silk cakes every day. Confucius also experienced hunger, but that was on the road to Chen and Cai, driving a cart with two horses, anxiously pursuing the political ideal of implementing the realm, not the time of lecturing at the Apricot Altar. If Confucius's teaching spirit is still today's teaching spirit, educators must also strive for a stable environment where they are not in Chen and Cai every day. Otherwise, it is what Mencius called climbing a tree to catch fish.

### Edison's Hobbies

— Guoping

In addition to working in the laboratory, Edison loved literature, art and music very much.

When he was in Paris, he visited several museums, but he did not think that ancient works of art were supreme. He once said: "The reason why ancient works of art are famous in the world and so valuable is only because of the principle of 'rarity makes things valuable'." At the same time, he greatly appreciated the modern works of the Luxembourg, and he also collected many paintings in his own home.

Edison was extremely interested in music. Due to his enthusiasm and love, he invented the phonograph. Edison was particularly fascinated by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He asked someone to make a record of this set, and whenever he was free, he would sit down and listen carefully. Edison could also play a good organ and violin himself.

Edison was extremely satisfied with the works of the Victorian period, especially the two poets Longfellow and Tennyson. However, Edison's most admired was Shakespeare. Edison once said: "Ah, Shakespeare! He has great and profound ideals! If he engaged in scientific research, he would definitely be a super inventor. He seems to recognize the heart of everything. His creative ability to portray things will never be exhausted." However, Edison thought that Shakespeare's words were too profound and should be adapted into popular sentences.

Edison had a deep love for the beauty of nature. He loved flowers so much that he always liked to bring back a large bouquet of flowers of various colors when he went for a walk in the countryside. He often lingered in the countryside, loving the green trees, the fancy clouds, and the rolling mountains....

In these things, Edison realized the meaning of life and the true meaning of life. When he got up every morning, he always looked forward to the new day with a happy mind; when he went to bed every night, he always felt that the work of the day was purposefully completed.

### "Procedures"

— Canxia

All "bureaucrats" are very particular about "procedures". The word "procedure" is originally something that should exist, and in some places, it is indeed something to be emphasized. However, once it falls into the hands of "bureaucrats", it becomes somewhat different.

In terms of corruption: as long as the procedures are complete, it is not easy for others to find evidence of crime. In terms of handling official business: the procedure has become a tool for shirking responsibility.

What is most annoying is that officials talk about procedures everywhere and at all times, "As long as my own procedures are done, I don't care if people die!" This sentence has become a mantra of civil servants, and as a result, it has become "procedure politics".

I say that procedures are like etiquette, and they should be required in places where they are indispensable, just like bowing when welcoming and seeing off guests. But if you use this etiquette too much, it will be annoying. It is clear that the most respectful salute only requires three bows, but you have to do six bows and nine bows. It is clear that when seeing off a guest, it is enough to walk to the door and give a bow, but you have to take a step and give a bow. Isn't this too annoying and too ridiculous!

I still have to say it separately. These so-called procedures are only emphasized by bureaucrats to deal with and restrain others, but they will neglect themselves. For example, our deputy secretary often takes out the leave slips of people who have overstayed their leave and points at them, saying: "This guy is no good, he overstayed his leave and didn't ask for an extension. He didn't do the procedures, damn it!" But what about himself? He often doesn't come for two weeks when he only asked for three days of leave.

From this, one can also imagine that the so-called "law" is only set up to manage people, and it seems that it is not needed for oneself, and it is not needed. "Procedures" are just like that!

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Life certainly does not need pearls and necklaces to embellish it, but it does not need too much garbage either.

There is no perfect thing in the world, because even if it is perfect, it is still missing a little bit - the beauty of imperfection.

It is impossible to live forever. In fact, even death is not very easy.

### Poetry Records of Haihonglou

— Xu Banmeng

Contentment

The most precious thing in life is contentment, and contentment broadens the mind. Cool clouds rise at the end of the sky, wandering alone. Have a cup of tea to drink, have a glass of wine to taste, have a poem to chant, have a book to read, sleep soundly at night, walk back and forth in the painting, peach blossoms smile charmingly, green willows are planted in the wind, the spring light is荡荡, but the spring mood is gradually destroyed. Only the endless war makes people sad!

Worldly Fate

Killing aura fills the passes and rivers, what can be done with the remaining life! Often shed tears when facing flowers, sing aloud alone when watching the moon. White hair fills the head, yellow dust chases the shadow, there is nothing to love in the world, and loving brings much sorrow.

Rhyming with Jingzhai

Peach blossoms in twos and threes, a window of spring, willow branches with thousands of strands, fresh with rain. Today there is enough poetic material in the sunny garden, full of charm, beauty surpassing the dust.

### Warning

— Daoxian

Einstein said: "I don't know what kind of weapons humans will use in the Third World War - if the Third World War breaks out. But I can tell you that the weapons used in the Fourth World War - are stones and sticks."

### Jinshan After the Disaster

The Zha Ding in front of the Great Buddha Hall still stands alone, but the Great Hall itself has become a pile of rubble; (Below) The Sutra Repository has been reduced to scorched earth, with scriptures scattered all over the ground.

### Wangsi Restaurant

— Qian Dacheng

In the fine days of spring and autumn, people from Shanghai who visit Yushan gather in Wangsi Restaurant for banquets; the traffic is heavy, reaching the height of the moment. Wangsi Restaurant is located at the mountain gate of Poshansi Temple. In the early years of the Republic of China, it was just a village shop. The owner, Wangsi, provided guests with yellow chicken, white wine, mountain delicacies and wild vegetables, which were quite authentic, and the wine was particularly mellow. The cost was not high, but one could get the pleasure of Tao Ran. Later, the business became more and more prosperous, and he rebuilt a three-room tall building, also equipped for grand banquets; people from other places flocked to it, and its value rose day by day, so that poor scholars did not dare to ask about it. Around 1935 and 1936, Yi Junzuo came to Yu, and after getting drunk, he waved his pen to the guests and presented a quatrain, and the name of Wangsi Restaurant spread throughout Jiangnan. It is said that last year, the Chairman's wife came here for a small drink in a light car and simple attire, and also praised its dishes as not bad. This year, a car park has been opened in front of the store, and the daily income is no less than that of a middle-class family. Although its dishes are still advertised as "yellow chicken, white wine, mountain delicacies and wild vegetables", in fact, mountain delicacies and seafood are available at a moment's notice, and the food is as big as a zhang, but its taste is also ordinary. The true taste is finally polluted by the popular custom, and thus the change of the world can also be glimpsed. However, Changshu's consumption is too high compared to its production, and it is difficult to establish any industry or commerce. Fortunately, Wangsi Restaurant and Ma Yongzhai can absorb foreign capital. Now that Wangsi has passed away, his son is humble and refined and works as an elementary school teacher.

### Small Town

— Xu Jiansheng

There are many small county towns under the jurisdiction of the provinces and cities in Jiangnan, but it is rare for a town like Hengfeng in eastern Jiangxi to be so small. Hengfeng County was Xing'an County in the Qing Dynasty, and is now passed through by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Its county seat is located in a valley, and there are only hundreds of houses in the city, which is not as big as a large town in other counties. It is only one li from east to west, so the locals have a saying: "Small Hengfeng County, three tofu shops; farting in the city, can be heard outside the city."

### Ling

It is reported that in Sichuan Province, another incident occurred in which a car driver destroyed a newspaper office, allegedly due to an article titled "Alas, Mr.". There are also events such as "car drivers", and details are not available from afar. Perhaps it was a playful piece of writing, with some light teasing, which caused resentment and evolved into a martial drama, which is also possible. As for the word "夫", it was originally a title for a noble status, without any humble meaning. The reason why Confucius was called "夫子" was because the old gentleman had been a "大夫", so adding the word "夫" to express respect. Otherwise, just the word "子" would be enough. In those days, scholars, even students to teachers (unemployed), only called so-and-so "子", and could not call them "夫". In operas, some prime ministers call themselves "老夫", but those who are only village elders and rich people, such as Deng Bodao, who sent his son to Sangyuan, and Lu Boshe, who captured and released Cao, only call themselves "老漢", and cannot call themselves "老夫". Also, in the previous dynasties, women below the third rank were only called Shuren, Gongren, Yiren, Anren, Ruren, and only those of the first and second rank could be called "夫人". Men of the first to fifth rank were "大夫", and those below the sixth rank were only called "郞". The Book of Rites says: "夫者, 以知帥人者也." The character is "一大", and its meaning is "to lead others with knowledge", so it can be relied upon and called "丈夫", a man of integrity and courage, a steel "大丈夫", a hero. As for sedan chair carriers, coachmen, and drivers, they are also in charge of their duties and responsible for their responsibilities. In the past, people generally valued officials and gentry, so they forcibly added a "亻" to the word "夫" to make "伕", presumptuously pretending to be clever, which is not sufficient as evidence.

It is also heard that some people strongly advocate changing "夫" to "駕駛員". According to the word "員" is a counting word, such as "幾員大將" "一員官", which is often seen in general records and novels and dramas. "官員" and "職員" are indeed in the official rank, while "會員" and "雇員" are civilian in style. Since the Republic of China, we have been wary of bureaucratic habits and changed "官" to "公務員" (the combined sound of these three characters is still the word "官"), saying that they are personnel serving public affairs, different from "私務員". If so, then anyone who drives for an organization to deliver official documents can also be called a "公務員", not just a "駕駛員"? For thirty years, terms such as rickshaw puller and coachman have been popular for a long time, and there has never been any objection. Only in recent years, "air travel" has become popular, and its drivers are often called drivers and not "夫". Some say, airplanes have engines, why don't cars have engines? Drivers who fly in the air are no longer called "夫", so why shouldn't drivers who drive on land be called "員"? Because they all have "engines", this is true, but if cars follow the example of airplanes, then "three-wheelers" can also follow the example of cars, because they are all "cars", although there is no engine to drive, but they have never driven without driving. Therefore, "two-wheelers" can also follow the example of three-wheelers, because three-wheelers and two-wheelers are the same "wheel", and there is no "engine". For the sake of public welfare and the friendship of peers, we should plan comprehensively and think for the two-wheelers. If they are also called drivers, then they are dragged along, and it is really impossible to talk about driving. If they are allowed to be in the corner and not to be treated the same as the above three items, then there is a loss of integrity. There are still quite a few two-wheelers in the north now, and we must consider a proper name for them to show justice.
