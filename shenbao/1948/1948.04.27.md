### Cheng, Li, and Sun Accept the Public Opinion of the Central Executive Committee; Election Turmoil Has Subsided; Wang Chonghui and Others Pay Respects to the President and Report

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] President Chiang is concerned about the Vice Presidential election. At 9:00 AM on the 26th, he summoned Bai Chongxi at his official residence. In addition to inquiring about the war situation in Shaanxi Province, he also gave instructions on the Vice Presidential election. At 12:30 PM, he summoned Chen Zai Lei, Zhang , Bai Chongxi, Wang Chonghui, Zhang Lisheng, and six others to inquire about the situation of persuading the three candidates to withdraw from the election. At 5:00 PM, the President visited Tangshan. At 9:00 PM, he summoned Li Zongren, one of the candidates, at his official residence for a long discussion.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The representatives Wang Chonghui, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhiben, Chen Bulei, and Zhang Lisheng, dispatched by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, paid respects to President Chiang on the 26th at noon to report on the progress of discussions with the Vice Presidential candidates Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke. Cheng, Li, and Sun have all accepted the public opinion of the Central Executive Committee. On the Vice Presidential election issue, they will listen to the decision of the National Assembly and no longer insist on giving up. President Chiang was very pleased to hear this, believing that the election could proceed smoothly and expressed hope that the National Assembly representatives of the party would also understand the consensus declared by him in the Central Executive Committee and complete the Vice Presidential election as soon as possible. According to President Chiang's instructions at the Central Executive Committee on the 25th: The Central Executive Committee still follows the resolution of the Provisional Plenary Session on April 6th. The party will not determine a candidate for the Vice President in this term. Party comrades can participate in the election according to law in the National Assembly. (2) When party comrades vote, they can follow their own will and choose the candidate they consider most suitable. (3) Party comrades participating in campaigning or elections can express their freedom of speech, but must not engage in mutual attacks on each other. In other words, they can actively promote the election of a certain candidate, but must not negatively criticize any candidate. They should respect each other and trust each other, so as to establish good norms for the constitutional election.

Sun, Li, and Cheng Talk; Willing to Listen to the National Assembly's Decision

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Sun Ke, at 8:00 PM on the 26th, hosted a banquet for National Assembly representatives at the Longmen Restaurant. He stood up and said: His previous expression of giving up the election was to take into account the unity within the party, but now, in order to respect the resolution of the Central Executive Committee and the persuasion of Hu Shi, Yu Bin, Chen Qitian, and the other five members of the presidium of the National Assembly, he has decided to listen to the decision of the National Assembly. If the Assembly does not allow him to give up the election, he will only respect the opinion of the National Assembly.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Li Zongren, at 8:00 PM on the 26th, hosted more than 500 National Assembly representatives who were campaigning for him at Anle Ying. He gave a speech, explaining four points: (1) Giving up the election this time was an unavoidable move to take into account unity. (2) Now, in order to take into account the resolution and persuasion of the presidium of the National Assembly and the resolution of the Central Executive Committee, he has expressed his willingness to listen to the decision of the Assembly. Whether or not to run for election is his right, and the representatives' right to choose a candidate is the representatives' right. His participation in this election does not really hope for success, because only without success can he make suggestions to the head of state from a detached position. (3) Those who are running for election have all been friends who have gone through thick and thin together. He is really saddened by the unpleasantness caused by this election. (4) The party purge in the past was his suggestion, and he still deeply hates the Communist Party.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Cheng Qian issued a written statement on the evening of the 26th, saying: "My giving up the election is to make the Assembly proceed smoothly. As long as the Assembly can proceed smoothly, whether or not I participate in the election is not important." Cheng told reporters in the morning: "My statement of giving up the election has been sent to the presidium, and there is no need to withdraw it, but everything should respect the decision of the National Assembly."

### The Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Issue a Joint Statement, Hoping to Adhere to the Principle of Freedom in the Vice Presidential Election

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties issued a joint statement on the disturbance of the Presidential election on the 26th as follows:

"Regarding the Vice Presidential election, two sessions have been held on the 23rd and 24th of this month. The voters and candidates are proceeding according to law, and the situation is generally good. However, on the 25th, just as the third vote was about to begin, the legal candidates Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke suddenly announced that they would give up the election. If the three have no reason to give up, we cannot but think that their actions seem ill-considered. If it is because of environmental factors that they have to give up, then we cannot but feel great concern for the future of constitutional government.

In the past, the principles of constitutional drafting were discussed by various parties and social elites for a long time. In last year's constitutional National Assembly, we also participated in the effort. However, the legal quota for this National Assembly is 3,045, and our Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties account for less than one-ninth of the total. Maintaining the dignity of the constitution is our inescapable duty, but the maintenance of a free and harmonious atmosphere in the venue still depends on the efforts of the Kuomintang. Now that such a disturbance has occurred, we cannot but feel regret.

Now the Assembly has been forced to adjourn for two days due to this unfortunate incident. The situation is serious, and both domestic and foreign observers expect the Assembly to conclude successfully. The Vice President is produced according to law, and the facts are obvious, and no details can be allowed to occur. It is obvious that our Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties cannot but adhere to the original intention of maintaining the constitution and the purpose of uniting against foreign aggression, and internally, to alleviate the resentment of the Chinese people, and externally, to correct the perceptions of friendly countries. We will never condone any measures that damage the spirit of the constitution. As for the election process, we must strictly abide by the principle of freedom. We hereby inform our colleagues in the Assembly, and we hope that they will understand."

### Zhang Junmai's Talk

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Zhang Junmai, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, commented on the Vice Presidential election issue on the 26th: "Since the Republic of China, there have been trends in every presidential election. This presidential election was successfully produced, but unexpectedly, in the final stage of the Vice Presidential election, the candidates announced that they would give up, causing a great uproar. This is due to insufficient understanding of the rule of law and democracy.

The so-called law is like the rules of a craftsman, which can be used to make things square and round. It cannot be mixed with emotions and intentions. It is necessary to have the spirit of "hanging the law on the gate of the country and not changing a word." If you rely on your own preferences and arbitrarily make judgments, it is not enough to talk about the rule of law. The essence of democratic politics is to admit fair competition. All issues must be discussed openly, and the reasons must be convincing to the public, so the problems will be easily solved. The value of British and American politics lies in the solemn spirit of abiding by the law without any omissions throughout the country. This solemn spirit of abiding by the law is the foundation of the country and is worth emulating.

Regarding the selection of the Vice President, our party originally hoped that the Kuomintang would nominate one person to be elected. The previous meeting clearly declared that the Kuomintang would use the method of free election. Since a free election has been decided, the free will of the representatives to vote should be respected in order to establish a model of democratic politics. Our party hopes very much that no bad consequences will be caused by the Vice Presidential election, and that it will not fail the earnest expectations of the people of the country.

In democratic countries, divergent opinions before elections are common. Once the election is determined, all the past things will be forgotten. At the beginning of our country's constitutional government, we deeply hope to cultivate a democratic demeanor and that the Vice Presidential issue, which is still pending, can be resolved satisfactorily in accordance with the spirit of free election in the constitution, so as not to be laughed at by people at home and abroad.

### Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau Employees Donate a Presidential Special Train

Construction Begins Immediately, Completion Expected at the End of the Month

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th dispatch] President Chiang was elected as the first president, and the whole country cheered. All employees of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau specially donated money to build a special train for the first president, which is currently being built in Puzhen Airport and is expected to be completed by the end of the month.

### Zeng Qi's Talk

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The National Assembly elected the Vice President, and because the candidates Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke successively gave up the election, the meeting was adjourned and the election was suspended for several days, which attracted attention at home and abroad. Zeng Qi, chairman of the China Youth Party, recently made a speech saying: In this election, I have always advocated adopting both the "Western democratic spirit" and the "Eastern spirit of concession." Therefore, I am unwilling to run for both president and vice president. It is true that the Kuomintang has been in power for 20 years, has many talents, and has a superior position. The minority party should let them be elected so that they can shoulder more and heavier responsibilities. Now that the president has been elected, the Vice Presidential election has suddenly taken a turn for the worse. This is really unfortunate for the Assembly and a crisis for the constitutional government. I am really worried. I hope that the candidates can all have the demeanor of statesmen, follow public opinion, not retreat due to setbacks, and not be discouraged by failure. I once said that politicians should have three styles: one is demeanor, advance and retreat, open and aboveboard, honor and disgrace, and be calm. This is demeanor. The second is integrity, wealth cannot be licentious, poverty cannot be moved, and power cannot be subdued. This is integrity. The third is friendship, promoting the good of others, helping others achieve their beauty, being urgent for others' needs, and worrying about others' worries. This is friendship. If these three styles can be shown to the whole country, then whether the election is successful or not, it will be respected by the people of the country. For example, the demeanor of Yu Ranweng in Sanyuan in recent days can be used as an example. Zhang Jiangji once said: "If gains and losses, slander and praise, success and failure cannot be broken through, then there is nothing that can be done in the world." Zhuge Wuhou said himself: "My heart is like a scale, and I cannot make light or heavy for others." I believe that those in power must have this magnanimity. Now is the time to suppress chaos and build the country. We should be in awe of the meaning of "success in war lies in harmony" and not let our loved ones feel pain and our enemies feel happy, so as to avoid the Communist Party from laughing secretly beside us. We must know that disputes should be avoided and harmony can unite. The three gentlemen, Sun, Li, and Cheng, who are running for election, all belong to the same party. Presumably, there is no reason why they cannot be harmonious. I very much hope that they can show the people of the country the ethics of Westerners playing ball and the model of constitutional government, so that the Assembly will still close smoothly.

### Li Zongren's Campaign Committee Sends a Letter Inquiring to the Transportation Service Agency

Questioning the Source of the Advertisement on the 23rd

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The advertisement published by the Nanjing Transportation Service Agency in the Xinmin Daily on the 23rd, which caused a turn in the Vice Presidential election (the main idea was reported yesterday), has raised the issue of investigating responsibility. Li Zongren's Vice Presidential campaign committee sent a letter to the agency on the afternoon of the 26th to investigate the matter. The letter said: "Our office has checked the advertisement of your agency published in the Xinmin Daily on the 23rd of this month, which has been criticized by the extra edition of the Central Daily News on the 25th, which not only considers it childish and ridiculous, but also considers that it has caused rumors among the representatives of the National Assembly and the general public. This is related to the reputation of Director Li's campaign committee. Who instructed this kind of advertisement, or is it your agency's autonomous behavior in order to solicit business through advertisements? We hope that you will reply clearly in writing within half a day of receiving the letter, and hope that you will still publish the truth in the Xinmin Daily on the 27th. If you delay the reply, our committee will immediately file a lawsuit according to law." Zhu Guangzheng, general manager of the Transportation Service Agency, replied: "I have received your letter and learned that the advertisement of our agency has had an impact on your reputation, and I express my deep regret. I hereby reply." Zhu hosted reporters at 8:00 PM on the 26th for this matter, explaining that after reading the extra edition of the Central Daily News on the 26th, he drafted an advertisement that evening and sent it to the Xinmin, Dagang, and Heping newspapers, but it was not published. Zhu also made a defense against the criticism of the Central Daily News, and said that he is a member of the Kuomintang, and his advertisement and free supply of cars for representatives who elected Li were done as a civilian. Zhu also insisted that he had never met Li.

### Date of the First Legislative Yuan Meeting to be Decided After the List of Names is Announced; The Meeting Preparatory Office Announced its Abolition Yesterday

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The "Preparatory Office for the First Legislative Yuan Meeting under the Constitution," which was attached to the current Legislative Yuan Secretariat and presided over by the current Secretary-General Lou Tongsun, was abolished on the 26th.

Editorial

### We Can No Longer Disappoint the People!

The whole country is watching the Vice Presidential election. Both ballots failed to produce a winner with over half of the votes, so there was no Vice President. When the National Assembly was about to hold the third ballot, the three candidates suddenly declared that they would withdraw from the election, which almost caused a political uproar. Not only did it make the third ballot impossible, but it also forced the National Assembly to use adjournment to quell this shocking situation. After two days of running around and mediation by various parties, the anger in the capital was finally diluted. The three candidates have all expressed their willingness to follow the decision of the General Assembly. If the General Assembly does not accept the declaration of withdrawal from the election, they will continue to run. Although this storm is gradually subsiding, whether the anger in the capital can be completely transformed into peace and harmony, and whether the National Assembly can hold the third ballot according to law tomorrow (the 28th), is a major key. Therefore, we have to appeal to the members of the National Assembly and ask you to attend the National Assembly to vote tomorrow. You must act according to your personal conscience and not forget the ancient teaching of "one thought for the country, one thought against the country." Representatives, you must not disappoint the people again!

First, although the people of the country regard the National Assembly's election of the Vice President as the most exciting finale of the National Assembly, and watch the first and second ballots with all eyes, they do not particularly value the Vice President. Therefore, when the competition among the candidates reached a fever pitch, although the capital was filled with tension, other parts of the country maintained an optimistic attitude. Moreover, everyone believes that, whether in accordance with the provisions of our country's constitution, or looking at the precedents of advanced democratic countries, the Vice President's position in the country is not very important. Among the six candidates, no matter which one is elected, they can be competent and more than capable, and there is no difference. Therefore, no matter what high-sounding views the Vice Presidential candidates expressed, they did not attract the attention of our ordinary people. It is only because the country can embark on the normal operation of democratic constitutionalism from now on, so they hope that this National Assembly will complete its legal procedures as soon as possible, that's all.

Second, everyone does not deny that democratic politics in our country is still in the stage of learning. The chaos in the National Assembly's meeting this time was indeed expected. However, the representatives' use of "booing" to resist the speeches of opponents, and even resorting to physical violence at the slightest disagreement, this kind of arbitrary and unreasonable behavior has exceeded the limits we expected. Since the opening of the National Assembly, almost every day there has been a quarrel in the venue. We can find almost daily in the news about the venue happenings that can be used as jokes. If this kind of disorderly National Assembly continues, it will not only waste money and manpower, but also be futile. Moreover, it is all harmful and not beneficial to the future of the democratic party politics. The so-called everything is cautious in the beginning. When taking a big step towards democratic constitutionalism, if a good model cannot be established, then our country's democratic constitutionalism will have no future. Therefore, we hope that the members of the National Assembly can reflect on themselves, and that attendance at the National Assembly must respect the law and abide by order, so that the National Assembly can proceed smoothly and complete its basic tasks as soon as possible. On the morning of the 25th, some representatives, because they were stimulated by the candidates' withdrawal from the election, arbitrarily shouted in the venue, which turned the National Assembly into a noisy place. This kind of behavior that undermines the progress of the Assembly's discussions, even if it can be forgiven by the presidium, is always unforgivable in the eyes of our ordinary people. Tomorrow's National Assembly will hold the third vote, which can be said to have reached the final moment. If there are any representatives who make trouble for no reason, arbitrarily shout, and undermine the progress of the third vote, they will be abandoned by the people of the country. The voters can dismiss them according to law, and even in the opinion circles, they should do their best to condemn them.

Third, according to the evening newspapers, two campaign teams have established two permanent organizations, one called the "Democratic Constitutional Movement Committee" and the other named the "Constitutional Promotion Association." According to our own declared purpose, it is to supervise the government's implementation of constitutionalism. We do not ask what the motives of these National Assembly representatives are in initiating the organization? However, we cannot but point out that since the opening of the National Assembly, these National Assembly representatives' actions to establish laws and protect the constitution have been seen everywhere. Now, instead of seeking oneself, they are harshly criticizing others and establishing other iron rules. Even if there is no political conspiracy or other effects, the result will inevitably create a split within the National Assembly, only making relatives sad and enemies happy. Therefore, we have to sincerely tell the representatives that this kind of behavior that splits the National Assembly is definitely not the wish of our ordinary people. If you are unwilling to consider the support or opposition of public opinion and insist on your own way, it will inevitably arouse the anger of the people of the whole country.

Fourth, the accidental storm in this Vice Presidential election was caused by rumors inside and outside the meeting, which caused misunderstandings among the candidates. However, the Vice Presidential candidates are all veterans of the party and the country, and leaders of the people, so they will not resort to unscrupulous means to attack each other. We believe that these leaflets that slander the other party must have been done by their campaign teams, there is no doubt. We are unwilling to harshly criticize the excessive enthusiasm of these campaign workers, but we cannot but hope that the candidates can use the magnanimous demeanor of politicians to clarify the source of the rumors and make them disappear. The three gentlemen, Li, Sun, and Cheng, are willing to listen to advice, accept the advice of the presidium of the National Assembly, and express their willingness to listen to the decision of the General Assembly, still showing the demeanor of statesmen. We hope that Li will express his opinion clearly as soon as possible.

Finally, we must also point out that the current situation is more serious than any period in history. The Communist Party's conspiracy to destroy China is to destroy the Kuomintang first. When we see through the inner layer of the Kuomintang, it is undeniable that it is on the verge of disintegration. The occurrence of this Vice Presidential election storm is an exposure of the Kuomintang's internal weaknesses, which cannot but cause us infinite worries. Even if the members of the National Assembly are unwilling to be members of the Kuomintang, they are also unwilling to be slaves of a subjugated country. Therefore, we must ask the members of the National Assembly to raise their vigilance, strengthen unity, and strive to promote democratic constitutionalism and complete the suppression of the rebellion and national construction. Only when everyone stands together and unites sincerely can democratic constitutionalism embark on the right track. Representatives, you must not disappoint the people again.

[Our Dispatch from Bengbu on the 24th] The Yellow Flood Area includes the areas flooded by the Hong wash in the three provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui.

### The "Living Immortal" From Shizhu to Chongqing; Teenage Girl Yang Mei; Has Not Eaten for Nine Years

This is a strange event that has stirred the mountain city, and it is also a physiological phenomenon worthy of study. The reporter, Mr. Zhen, only reported a piece of evidence that someone does not eat, but did not fabricate any deceptive lies. The questions raised in it must be studied by physiologists, physicians, or scientists. (Editor)

[Chongqing dispatch from our newspaper on the 22nd] When the price of grain is rising sharply, and many people are struggling on the verge of starvation, feeling the threat of life, suddenly, a teenage girl from Shizhu who has not eaten for nine years comes to Chongqing. How amazing is this news? Driven by curiosity, the reporter went to the National Women's Normal College in Jiulongpo to visit. It is said that "this Shizhu girl lost her parents early in her childhood and was raised in her uncle's house. Because her uncle's family was poor, she could not receive school education. So far, she does not have a name. People call her 'Yang Mei.'"

A Strange Disease According to legend, nine years ago, Yang Mei and a group of rural children went to the hillside to dig "Cigu" (arrowhead) to eat. She dug up a very large one and ate it, then suffered from abdominal pain and diarrhea, and was bedridden. After taking medicine and recovering, she has never eaten food, and it has been nine years now! If she is forced to eat, she will vomit immediately. Therefore, she does not excrete feces, and even urination is rare. Although she does not eat or drink, her health has not been affected at all. Her body is not thin, and the muscles of her hands and feet are very developed, and her face is ruddy.

After Coming to Chongqing Recently, a senator accompanied Yang Mei to Chongqing, wanting to find the medical community to examine the reason why she does not eat food. He left her at the home of Zhuo Songdai, the director of general affairs at the Women's Normal College. Zhuo and She are relatives, so they take good care of her. Director Zhuo Songdai once wrote twenty words to teach her, and she learned them soon, without fail. This proves that her intelligence is not low. But when asked how old she is this year, she does not know. Judging from her appearance, she is about twenty years old.

Inspection Report Zhuo's mother-in-law, Mrs. Zhang, said: Yang Mei has never had her period. She occasionally drinks tea, but urinates immediately. She has drunk raw water, but has never gotten sick. Her teeth are naturally white and not brushed. She is indeed a piece of evidence that does not eat, and this is not a deceptive lie.

Ms. Xu Qinshu, director of the health team at the Women's Normal College, said after the examination: Yang Mei was naked and allowed me to examine her. There was nothing different from ordinary people. The pulse and heartbeat were normal, and the lungs also met health standards. Although the breasts were not very developed, they were not abnormal. Only the abdomen was not large. When the stethoscope was pressed on the abdomen, there was only the sound of water being squeezed, probably because there was no food in the stomach.

Unwilling to Marry Her Yang Mei has not eaten anything for nine years, which should be an enviable gospel to those who are struggling on the verge of starvation. However, her fiancé broke off the engagement with her for this sole reason. Later, her uncle re-arranged a marriage for her, but the result was still the same. This fiancé, as usual, was unwilling to marry a woman who did not eat. So she had to live alone. People happily talk about the living immortal on Jiulongpo, but she herself has not found or enjoyed the happiness of life. (Wei Xuezhen)

### Disturbances and Demonstrations in Korean Bridge in Osaka and Kobe; US Military Declares Emergency Martial Law; Japanese Ministry of Education Says It Will Not Withdraw the Order to Close Korean Schools; More Than 900 Koreans and Japanese People Reported

[United Press, Kobe, 26th] The US military headquarters ordered a full-scale round-up of the Japanese Communist Party and Koreans who rioted last weekend on the 26th. This is the first official order after the declaration of temporary martial law. Chinese military police are now patrolling the Kobe area to prevent the outbreak of new incidents. Japanese police are commanded by Minoch, commander of the US military police at Kobe base, during the temporary emergency martial law period.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] According to Japanese sources, General Acheson has ordered that all Koreans found near the Kobe Prefectural Government, regardless of their purpose or occupation, be arrested. According to Osaka Police Chief Suzuki, Japanese police have been ordered to shoot and kill any Korean rioters who threaten public order.

[United Press, Osaka, 26th] Ten thousand Koreans in the area were officially allowed to march and demonstrate on the 26th, kidnapping two Japanese police officers, who were safely released two hours later. At the same time, all indications are that the Communist Party is inciting the disturbance in order to embarrass the United States in the South Korean election on May 10th. The demonstrating Koreans gathered in front of the Osaka City Hall, while the Korean leaders went inside to discuss the dispute caused by the Korean schools. The Tokyo National Police Agency of Japan stated that it had learned that the Communist Party had been ordered to instigate Korean demonstrations throughout Japan, and to hold a huge march in Tokyo on May 10th. It also stated that on May Day, demonstrations will be held in major cities in Japan, with Koreans participating in a prominent position. A march will also be held in Yamaguchi Prefecture, western Honshu, on May 6th. Newspapers claimed that the Korean demonstration was part of the Communist Party's agenda to harass the United States and persuade Koreans to boycott the election. The Eighth Army reported that seven of the arrested ringleaders in the Kobe riot were members of the Japanese Communist Party.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Reinforcements for the Korean masses arrived this morning from the Kyoto, Nara, and Kobe areas to Osaka. There were more than 1,500 Koreans in the area, armed with wooden sticks and chili powder, gathered in front of the prefectural government. At 11:00 am this morning, there were about 1,300 Koreans on the highway from Kyoto to Osaka. About 1,000 Koreans came from the Nara area, and about 800 came from Hyogo via Kobe.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] General Acheson, Commander of the US Eighth Army, flew to Kobe this morning to inspect the disturbance in person.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese Vice Minister of Education Arimitsu Jiro stated this morning that there have been serious Korean riots in Osaka and Kobe in the past few days, but the Japanese government will not withdraw its order to close Korean schools in Japan.

[United Press, Kobe, 26th] Lieutenant General Acheson, commander of the US Eighth Army in Japan, bluntly attacked the Japanese Communist Party at a press conference here on the 26th as "obviously the instigator of several riots over the weekend in the Kobe-Osaka area." Acheson also said that 30 Koreans had been arrested for participating in the march and imprisoning the mayor, and eight Japanese people arrested on the same charges had been proven to be members of the Japanese Communist Party, one of whom was a Kobe city councilor.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The Japanese Communist Party, which was condemned for supporting Korean riots in Japan, issued a formal statement today supporting the actions of the Koreans.

[Associated Press, Kobe, 26th] The situation in Kobe has calmed down. Military police vehicles with four soldiers each are patrolling, armed. Osaka is still large

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur's headquarters issued a special statement by Lieutenant General Acheson, commander of the US Eighth Army, on the clashes between Korean residents and Japanese police in Osaka and Kobe, stating: "On April 24, about 1,000 Koreans surrounded the prefectural government, deliberately cut power lines, destroyed equipment, and imprisoned the prefectural governor, police chief, mayor, etc. The US military's decision on how to resolve this incident is: (1) All Koreans detained in the past will be released; (2) All Korean schools recently closed will be reopened; (3) Koreans participating in illegal incidents should be prosecuted immediately in accordance with the law; (4) Punish the participants in this incident." According to the US military, "as of the 26th, the number of Koreans and Japanese Communist Party members who have been reported in this incident has reached as many as 943."

### The Main Reason for the Korean Riots in Osaka and Kobe is Dissatisfaction with the Japanese Empire; Korean Residents Association Talks to US Reporters

[United Press, Kobe, 26th] The Korean Residents Association propaganda team told United Press reporters today that the riots in Osaka and Kobe were not incited by the Communist Party, but an outbreak of public dissatisfaction with Japanese imperialism. The association has 600,000 members, and the total number of Koreans in Japan is about 610,000. Another 10,000 Koreans are in contact with the association and youth associations to promote Korean independence. Although some of the association and other groups are communists, they are not political groups.

The uprising was not incited by a small number of people, as the military government in Tokyo claimed. The military government had ordered Korean residents to abide by the Japanese education system in Korean schools. The education of Korean residents is of great concern to everyone, even to people in Korea itself. These people are extremely angry at the Japanese interference in their education. The Koreans are negotiating with the Tokyo education authorities on the issue of local schools, but have not yet received a satisfactory response. I hope there will be no disturbances here, but it depends on the attitude of the Japanese. The Tokyo Education Bureau had ordered Korean residents to abide by the Japanese education system, otherwise the schools would be closed. Unrest in various parts of Korea on the eve of the election

### The Korean Communist Party Instigated the Sniping of an American Plane Taking Off from Jeju Island

Unrest in Various Parts of Korea on the Eve of the Election

According to the American military, ground personnel pursued the two, but they escaped. It was later reported that the telephone lines on the island were cut. It is reported that one Korean police officer and two other Koreans were shot and killed on the island. Since April 2nd, the death toll on the island has reached 49. The spread of the unrest has led the American military government to approve Korea's request to distribute ballots and ballot boxes for the May 10th election in American vehicles driven by Americans.

[Hapdong News Agency, Seoul, 26th] The American military announced on the 26th that the telephone lines to the American military camp in Daegu were cut off on the night of the 25th, but all telephone lines were repaired on the 26th. Near Daegu, ten rioters attacked the chairman of the local Youth Association, who is also a member of the local election committee.

The area is located on the Jerusalem-Nablus-Haifa highway and is the route through which British forces must withdraw from Palestine. The Haganah forces attacked the Arab forces there yesterday.

Following the example of the Lend-Lease Act during the war, American military aid will then be supplied to Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The Executive Committee of the Western European Union held its first meeting in London on the 24th and is expected to quickly form a permanent military committee, with representatives from the general staffs of the five countries. However, the American plan has not yet been completed. After Marshall returns from Bogotá, he will likely exert new pressure to realize it.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] The "News Chronicle" here today published an exclusive dispatch from its Washington correspondent, which was not found in other newspapers. It stated that Bevin and Bidault are expected to fly to Washington soon for an important meeting with Marshall.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 25th] Communist Party leader Togliatti issued a letter to all party members today, saying: "The results of the election are not in line with the expectations of the general public in Italy, which is an undeniable fact. However, the Communist Party has won more seats in the House than it did in the Constituent Assembly. It is particularly important to note that the current situation is more serious than ever before. Foreign imperialists, capitalists, rural reactionaries, priests, and social democratic traitors are now united and attacking us with unfounded rumors and violence. It is not easy for us to achieve such success under these circumstances." Togliatti concluded by saying, "We are prepared to begin new battles. The enemy will become stronger and stronger, but we will win the final victory."

### The Soviet Union Suddenly Participates in the Trusteeship Council; Appoints the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in the United States as Representative; It is Believed that the Soviet Union Will Participate in the Discussion of the Holy Land Issue

[United Press, Lake Success, 25th] The Soviet Union notified the United Nations Secretariat today by letter that it had appointed Tsalapkin, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy, as its representative to the Trusteeship Council. The Soviet Union refused to participate in the Trusteeship Council from its inception two years ago, believing that the organization was improperly organized. This sudden change of heart is probably intended to ensure full speaking rights in the discussion of the Palestine issue. Tsalapkin participated in the drafting of the UN Special Committee on Palestine, which strongly advocated partition, last autumn.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 25th, United Press] According to authoritative sources, the Soviet Union's participation in the Trusteeship Council was prompted by recent negotiations on Palestine. If the United Nations passes the U.S. proposal to place Palestine under the Trusteeship Council, the Soviet representative on the Trusteeship Council can express opinions, participate in debates, and participate in some important future consultations. The other eleven countries participating in the Trusteeship Council include the United States, Britain, China, and other countries. Even if the U.S. trusteeship plan is adopted, the Soviet Union's participation in the Trusteeship Council cannot prevent the control of Palestine by the two powers, because the veto power of the great powers cannot be applied to the Trusteeship Council.

### Early Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Fuel Oil; Pre-Allocation of Coal for One Month; Whether to Abolish the Adjusted Price Formula Awaits Discussion

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of indirect subsidies for public utilities in this city, the Municipal Government has been in contact with the Central Bank for several days regarding the early settlement of foreign exchange for fuel oil and gasoline needed by public utilities for one month. After continuous negotiations, an agreement has been reached. The total is approximately 250 billion national currency, of which the Shanghai Electric Power Company accounts for 200 billion. The company will find the funds on its own. Other public utility companies account for 50 billion. With the special approval of Mayor Wu, the funds needed will be temporarily allocated from the fines for saving electricity, calculated according to bank interest rates.

[Another report] Regarding the issue of indirect subsidies for public utilities, after consultations between the Municipal Government and the Fuel Management Committee of the Central Bank, a principle agreement has been reached on the two items of early settlement of foreign exchange and advance purchase of coal. Efforts will be made to advance the settlement of foreign exchange for fuel oil and gasoline purchased by public utility companies by one month, that is, to settle the foreign exchange for May in April. The coal needed will also be pre-allocated with one month's coal volume, approximately 50,000 tons. However, the Fuel Management Committee currently has too little coal reserves, so it is now necessary to rush coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai for supply. According to the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau, it is hoped that various indirect subsidies can be realized this month, so that the price of public utilities can be stabilized. However, the cost of living index and the hardware index are quite problematic. The cost of telephone is mainly based on the cost of living index and the hardware index. The cost of trams and buses is also mainly based on the cost of living index. It is currently impossible to reduce it. If various elements (foreign exchange, fuel, hardware index, cost of living index, etc.) in the costs of the eight major public utilities can be calculated according to the previous month, then their prices will no longer be adjusted. Whether the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities will be temporarily suspended in May is currently awaiting instructions from the Executive Yuan. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will convene a meeting within the next few days to discuss it.

### Result of Petition by Fujian Provincial Senators: Grain Tax Changed to Two Installments

### District Procuratorate Interrogates Wen Guangting's Lawsuit Yesterday; Court Police Suspected of Soliciting Bribes During Bail; Prosecutor Expresses Doubt; Police Precinct Dissatisfied with Wen's Declaration of Innocence

[Our Report] Wen Guangting, a worker at the Hufan Sand Casting Factory who was recently released on bail from the Sinan Road Detention Center, previously sent a letter to the Senate accusing police officers of illegally extorting confessions and court police of soliciting bribes. The District Procuratorate interrogated the case yesterday, with Prosecutor Liang Qingshun summoning Wen Guangting, Tian Abing, Tian Liangquan, and Xu Jingkuan for questioning, and all were ordered to return. When Wen arrived in court yesterday, he was wearing a blue cloth worker's jacket, gray cloth trousers, and rubber-soled sneakers. Wen is from Hunan and is about twenty years old. Yesterday, the prosecutor's interrogation was limited to the part about whether the court police had solicited bribes. The accusations against Wen of robbery and theft, and whether the police bureau had used torture, were not involved yesterday because they were within the scope of the trial. According to Wen, the court policeman Xu Jingkuan asked him for a bribe of 5 million yuan when he asked Hufan Sand Casting Factory to provide bail, because the old landlord Tian Abing was not in the factory, and no one in the factory was responsible for stamping the bail form. The demand was made by Xu to Wen on the way back to the district court. The prosecutor expressed doubt about this testimony, because without bail, there would inevitably be ____ detention, and there was no reason to ask Wen for a bribe after the bail was unsuccessful. He then asked whether he had given money to the court policeman. He replied, "No." He also said, "I didn't have a penny in my pocket. The 80,000 yuan for the round-trip fare when I was released on bail was borrowed from the Hufan Sand Casting Factory." Tian Abing was subsequently summoned for questioning. Tian said that on the day Wen came to seek bail, he happened to be out on business and did not return until late at night. Because he was not at home, no one else dared to take responsibility, but he said that he was willing to vouch for Wen. Tian Liangquan said that he had sent the bail form to the district court, but he did not know the other details.

Xu Jingkuan Denies Solicitation, Says He Even Paid for the Petition

Finally, court policeman Xu Jingkuan was summoned. Xu is the youngest of the court police and had studied at Xiaoguang Middle School. He was very upset about the accusation, saying that he not only did not solicit a penny from Wen, but even paid for a copy of the petition. Because the bail was not found, he was still escorted back and handed over to the judge. He fulfilled his responsibilities ____, as for how the judge handled it, he did not know, and now he has been falsely accused in this way, and he is very uncomfortable.

According to reliable sources, the later submission of Wen Guangting's supplementary bail form was put aside, and the delivery of the judgment to the defendant was ____, causing Wen Guangting to be detained for several more days. There is also suspicion that the court side was slow in handling the matter.

Rumored to be Manipulated by a Lawyer

Wen was detained even though he was innocent, and he held a grudge in his heart. It happened that a "lawyer" named Hu was also detained because of a case, and was also tried by Judge Cao Zuwei. Wen talked about the circumstances of the case, and Hu then wrote a secret letter to the Senate on Wen's behalf to accuse him. On the one hand, he vented his anger for Wen, and on the other hand, he also attacked Judge Cao. Also, because the details were flat, he fabricated the news that the court police solicited a bribe of 5 million yuan on behalf of the judge in order to sensationalize ____. The Xinshijie Police Precinct expressed dissatisfaction with the court's declaration of Wen's innocence in the robbery case, and yesterday submitted a statement to the court requesting a retrial.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee is scheduled to hold its first establishment meeting today at 5 p.m. in the bank's conference room at 15 The Bund. President Zhang will personally preside. Committee members Xu Baiyuan and Zhao Dixian have already arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing to attend.

[Report from the Joint Credit Information Office] Preparations for the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee are complete. The three national committees for industry, mining, trade, and agriculture have also been established one after another. The rediscount rules for each committee have been discussed and drafted. The Rediscount Committee has entered the practical implementation stage. According to the person in charge of the committee, speaking to a reporter from the Joint Credit Information Office, the Central Bank's rediscount work will not involve ordinary commercial institutions. Its direct targets are banks and the Joint Treasury. Those seeking national policy loans can apply to the Joint Treasury. After approval by the Joint Treasury, the National Bank Consortium will handle the loan. The Central Bank will then rediscount and re-mortgage. General manufacturers needing short-term capital should apply for loans from banks. When lending banks lack working capital, they can apply to the Central Bank for rediscounting. After the Rediscount Committee verifies the application, it can proceed with rediscounting or re-mortgaging. In this way, the Central Bank can fulfill its role as "the bank of banks." As for the rediscount rate, the Rediscount Committee will determine it based on the actual situation.

### Lifting of Southern Shipping Ban Boosts Morale; Cotton Yarn Market Active; 42-count Yarn Rose by Four Million Compared to the Weekend

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw a surge in buying interest due to the lifting of the southern shipping ban, with buyers from other provinces, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Hankou actively procuring goods. Trading within Shanghai intensified, and the upward trend became more pronounced. Forty-two-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn immediately jumped by four million, reaching 235 million. Subsequently, local and out-of-town buyers, along with support from speculative traders, propelled the market price to a new high of 237 million. Towards the close of trading, profit-taking led to a decline, ending at 236 million, an increase of four million compared to the previous weekend. Prices for other yarns, such as 42-count "Bao Guang" and "Jin Cheng," also increased by four to five million. For 21-count "Double Horse" yarn, out-of-town buyers actively purchased due to the improved market sentiment, and local traders also participated, pushing the price up by six million. Other yarns, including 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, and 32-count yarns of various fineness, also saw increases ranging from six to seven million, or about 50%.

Cotton Cloth Slightly Rises Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was buoyed by the lifting of the ban on shipping yarn and cloth to the south, and morale improved significantly. Retail investors continuously pushed up prices. Initially, the price of fine cloth rose to 5.08 million, then, with purchases from out-of-town buyers, the price rose further to 5.13 million. Subsequently, due to increased selling, the price fell rapidly to 4.97 million. Towards the close of trading, due to the strong rise in yarn prices, short positions were covered, and the market price rebounded to 5.02 million, an increase of 120,000 compared to the previous weekend. Prices for other fine cloths, white cloth, dyed cloth, and shirting also saw increases.

Spot Cotton Firm Yesterday, the spot cotton market remained firm due to the lifting of the ban on shipping yarn and cloth to the south, and the closing prices of cotton yarn were high, boosting morale among traders. In particular, credit conditions among traders eased, and the supply of goods on the market was very limited, leading to aggressive bidding. However, as the official opening purchase prices had not yet increased, sellers were reluctant to sell, and transactions were minimal. The opening price for Lingbao cotton for delivery to the public treasury was 25.3 million, Qidong cotton was 22.5 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 4.85 million.

### Reduction in Gasoline Allocation to be Replaced by Alcohol

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the allocation of gasoline in this city has been decreasing daily. Industries and transportation companies are affected by the need to use it and feel that business cannot be expanded. According to reporters, the two industries are looking at replacing gasoline with alcohol. It is said that the sugar factories in Taiwan are producing a lot of alcohol right now and the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Chongqing, and Jiangxi are producing large quantities of alcohol when making molasses. At the same time, alcohol factories in Shanghai and Chongqing can resume operations since the use of alcohol is increasing. The Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of this city, in view of this, has drafted detailed substitute plans and submitted them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review.

### Qianzhuang Small Loan Program Increases Loan Limits

### Pig Bristle Export Situation Improves This Year

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the export situation of pig bristles in our country has gradually improved. According to statistics, the export volume in the past three months has increased significantly compared to the second half of last year. It is understood that the main reason is that nylon, invented by the United States during the war, is not sufficient to replace pig bristles. Therefore, general brush factories are gradually switching back to using pig bristles after the war. The main export destination for pig bristles in our country is still the United States, followed by the Soviet Union due to debt repayment relations. Exports to Europe are very limited due to the lack of US dollars.

### No Rigid Rules for Treasury Bill Issuance Discount

[Report from Our Newspaper] The issuance date of short-term treasury bills has not yet been decided.

Yesterday, local financial authorities stated that the purpose of treasury bill issuance is to stabilize the market and the financial system, and will not affect the business of general firms and banks. As for the issuance discount, it will be decided by the National Bank, and the Ministry of Finance has not set a rigid requirement of 85%.

### Stimulated by Hong Kong Electric’s Decline, Wing On Textiles Creates a New High Price

Yesterday, Chinese stocks, stimulated by Hong Kong Electric and driven by outside forces, were still able to move forward, but encountered considerable difficulties due to insufficient strength from securities firms. Although Wing On Textiles created a new high, small stocks retreated instead of advancing. The morning began with bullish factors, such as the stimulus from Hong Kong Electric. Wing On Textiles opened high at 2100 yuan. After the opening, Xinhua, Qinxing, and Yanggao returned, the exchange rate did not change, and Wing On Textiles also fell to 2035 yuan.

In the afternoon market, Wing On Textiles immediately rose to 2115 yuan. Although it rose to 2120 yuan, it fell back to 2090 yuan due to more settlements. No. 183 and others advanced. After 3:00 PM, although the National Bank had a large number of transactions, the buying frenzy was stirred up by banks and securities firms, and Wing On Textiles rose to a closing price of 2140 yuan, which was a new high. Tongyi was suddenly snapped up by No. 220 and others, rising a lot. China Silk also showed a limit-up performance. As a result, compared to the morning close, Huaxin, Tongyi, China Silk, and National Goods rose by 50%, Xinyi was still flat, Qinxing fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly.

The factory silk market rose again yesterday. C-grade traded for 405 million yuan, with two transactions. Another lot was sold for 390 million yuan, and Double Tiger for 95 million yuan, a increase of 20 million yuan compared to last Saturday. Due to restrictions on cocoon loans requiring a 20% self-funded deposit and only allowing factory silk to be mortgaged for 10%, spot goods are bound to be scarce, leading to a bullish outlook. Transactional sales were very scarce, and the market sentiment was stable.

The silk goods market rose first and then fell slightly yesterday. Silk quilt covers finally rose by 8 million yuan over last Saturday. Huaxin goods opened high at 160 million yuan, then retreated to around 159 million yuan, and finally fell to 156.8 million yuan at the close. Dachang check crepe closed at 560,000 yuan.

### Rice Market Opens High, Then Closes Flat

The rice market followed the rise in tin prices and tried to increase, with owners asking for higher prices. The morning market rose by 100,000 yuan, but this was a forced increase as actual sales remained sluggish. Even if the price was raised, it would be in vain. The market returned to flat in the afternoon. The result was an increase of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, with only Baiyuan rising by 200,000 yuan to 4.3 million due to brisk sales. The Beishi market also rose early and then fell, rising by 100,000 yuan. Special high-grade japonica rice was heavily resisted at 4.15 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan, with 4,380 shi arriving.

Red sorghum was firm, green beans were flat, sesame rose slightly by 50,000 or 100,000 yuan, and the peanut market was firm. The opening was very firm. Soy oil factories opened at a high price of 8.8 million yuan, but due to the high price, buyers did not step forward, leading to a return of goods for profitable sales. The market fell back to 8.7 million yuan, rising slightly by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. The raw oil market was also ordinary. Qingdao goods rose by 100,000 yuan, Jiangbei goods rose by 50,000 yuan, and small car sesame oil rose by 50,000 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil opened at 8.6 million yuan.

### Whitehead on: The Mission of the University

— Zuo Yu

What is the mission or purpose of a university? Why do we spend so much money to establish universities? Educators or politicians have various answers to this question. The late British philosopher Professor A. N. Whitehead wrote an article entitled "Universities and Their Function," which contains several passages concerning the mission of the university that are worthy of our attention. The following is an introduction to these passages.

Whitehead believes that universities are indeed schools of education and research. However, the main reason for the existence of universities is not merely to instill knowledge into students, nor is it merely to provide research opportunities for professors. These two functions can be obtained at a very low cost, without the need for such expensive institutions. Books are cheap, and the apprenticeship system is well-known. If the mission of the university is only to instill knowledge, then since the widespread use of printing in the fifteenth century, there has been no reason for the existence of the university. However, the rise and flourishing of universities occurred after the fifteenth century, and have been particularly vibrant recently. This proves that the mission of the university is not simply the instilling of knowledge.

According to Whitehead, the reason for the existence of the university is to maintain the connection between knowledge and the essence of life, and to combine young people and old people in a common imaginative exploration of learning. The university is for instilling knowledge, but this is the imaginative instilling of knowledge. At the very least, the imaginative instilling of knowledge is the mission that the university should accomplish for society. If a university does not perform this mission, then this university has no reason to exist. The air of excitement generated by imaginative exploration can transform knowledge. With imagination, a fact is no longer merely a fact. It adds all its possibilities to this fact. This fact is no longer a burden on our memory. This fact is a diligent worker, like the poet in our dreams, like the architect of our purposes.

Whitehead's so-called "Imagination," he believes, cannot be separated from facts. Imagination is a way of illuminating facts. The work of imagination is to propose those universal principles that are most useful for existing facts, and then to propose other possibilities consistent with these principles using an intellectual view. Imagination enables people to construct an intellectual vision of a new world and preserves the essence of life through the inspiration of fulfilling purposes.

Young people are imaginative. If the imagination of young people can be enhanced by disciplined training, then this imaginative ability can be largely retained for life. The tragedy of the world is that those who are rich in imagination lack experience, while those who are rich in experience have weak imagination. The foolish have no knowledge and act only according to imagination, while the timid have no imagination and act only according to knowledge. The mission of a university is to combine imagination and experience into one.

The above passages from Whitehead may seem too abstract and too vague to those with weak imagination. However, in these rather abstract words, Whitehead entrusts the university with the mission of promoting culture and creating culture. Creation or invention cannot lack knowledge or experience, and especially cannot lack imagination or reverie. Old people have experience or knowledge, but lack imagination. Young people have imagination, but lack knowledge and experience. The university brings young people and old people together, aiming to combine imagination and experience into one furnace. To supplement the old age with the imagination of youth, and to pass on the experience of the old age to the youth. This is the mission of the university.

### Aristotle's Classification of Philosophy

— Yizhi

Regarding the classification of philosophy, Aristotle's own views are not very consistent, and his books do not completely match his classification. Sometimes he divides all philosophy into two parts, namely theoretical and practical; sometimes he adds a third part, called productive. In addition, he divides all questions into three types in another place: (1) logical, (2) physical, and (3) ethical. The first type of question includes two parts, namely true logical questions and metaphysical questions; - this division is almost the same as Plato's (see my book Plato, Philosophical Industry Book of World Bookstore), probably he was influenced by Plato at that time before dividing it in this way.

According to the previous division, the theoretical part includes geography, mathematics, metaphysics (Aristotle called it first philosophy) or theology; the practical part includes ethics and politics; in the creative part, what he expounded (or what was handed down) was only poetics and rhetoric. The physics here includes not only physics itself, but also biology, psychology, etc.—in short, it includes all knowledge about the natural world. As for logic and rhetoric, both are just tools, not the main part of philosophy. Logic is the tool of all philosophy—or the entire knowledge—rhetoric is the tool of politics. The reason why he regarded rhetoric as a tool of politics was probably because he inherited the general social view at the time, thinking that this discipline was a powerful weapon on the political stage, and politicians could use this technique to overcome everything and gain political victory. The so-called sophists at the time were people who specialized in teaching this technique.

The reason why Aristotle divides philosophy into theoretical, practical, and creative parts is because the purposes of each part are different. In a broad sense, all knowledge is inseparable from knowledge. But in a narrow sense, the purpose of the metal theory part is recognition (Copnitoin), pure knowledge is its object; the purpose of the practical part is action, and human behavior is its object; the purpose of the creative part is making, and the works with Chuan or beauty are its objects. The practical part is the scope of ethics and politics, and the creative part is the scope of art; but they have the same point, that is, their objects are both changeable,—behavior in matters can change, and works of objects can also change. Let's listen to Aristotle himself:

"Human nature has two parts: the rational part and the irrational part. The rational part can also be divided, that is, it can also be divided into two parts: (1) that which has a relationship with unchanging things. (2) That which has a relationship with changing things; because the external world has different objects, the inner human nature also has different parts corresponding to them. Originally, the reason why knowledge is possible is because there are corresponding parts in human nature. Let us call the former the part of thought, and the latter the part of planning." (Nicomaichean Ethics, BK.-VI, 514)

"Changing things include things that are made and things that are done. Making is different from acting, so the instinct of making is also different from the instinct of acting, and the scope of the two does not infringe on each other. … All art is related to the matter of "generation", in other words, the vocation of art lies in studying how to make something that may or may not exist into something that exists; at the same time, the source of this thing is not in itself, but in the author who created it. Art has nothing to do with those things that necessarily exist and naturally exist and whose source is in themselves. " (Nicomacgean Ethics, BK. VI. 1140a-16)

According to Aristotle's own words, it can be seen that the reason why he divides philosophy into these three parts is because human nature has these three instincts. In his view, human nature can be divided into two main parts, namely the rational and the irrational. Regardless of the irrational, only speaking of the rational, there are two parts: (1) the Contemplative part. (2) The Calculative part—the former has a relationship with unchanging things, and the latter has a relationship with changing things. There are two kinds of changing things, one is the things that people do, and the other is the things that people make. Therefore, in terms of human nature, there are also two different instincts that correspond to these two different objects, which are: the instinct of acting and the instinct of making which are separated from the planning part.

The practical part is divided into ethics and politics. In fact, Aristotle regards ethics as a part of politics. His politics has two parts: (1) on individual behavior, (2) on national behavior. The former is ethics, and the latter is true politics; in addition, he also includes economics, tactics, rhetoric, etc. into the vassals of politics. Plato presents politics as a part of ethics. His ethics is divided into personal ethics and social ethics. In fact, the former is ethics and the latter is politics. Superficially, it seems that Aristotle's view is exactly the opposite of Plato's, but in fact it is the same; ——Plato uses ethics as the net to connect individuals and society, and Aristotle uses politics as the outline to encircle individuals and countries. This is also good, that is also good, anyway, individuals cannot be separated from society and the country, and the behavior of the national society can influence the behavior of individuals.

### Lao Tzu on Sages and Common People

— Yan Qun

Chapter 20 of the Tao Te Ching says: "Abandon learning, and you will have no worries. 'Wei' and 'A', how much difference is there between them? Good and evil, how far apart are they? What others cherish, you cannot but fear—how boundless and yet unfinished! The masses are joyous, as if feasting on a great sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace; I alone am tranquil and show no sign, like an infant who has not yet smiled, listless as if without a home. All men have more than enough, while I alone seem to have lost everything.—I have the mind of a fool, so simple! Common people are bright and clever, I alone am dull and confused; common people are sharp and discerning, I alone am muddled and ignorant. Vast am I, like the sea; aimless am I, like the ceaseless wind. All men have their uses, while I alone am stubborn and base. I alone am different from other men, and value drawing sustenance from the Mother." This chapter discusses the difference between sages and common people. I will interpret it to consult with scholars.

"Abandon learning, and you will have no worries," opens the following two sentences. "Wei" and "A," though different, are both responses; "good" and "evil," though distinct, are still relative. These are what ordinary people discern through learning. Ordinary people, in their studies, are confined to fixed concepts and bound by the principle of consistency of thought (Law of the Consistency of Thought), accepting 'Wei' and rejecting 'A', embracing 'good' and rejecting 'evil'. If they could understand it through the "Tao," then differences could lead to similarities, and opposites could become interconnected—but ordinary people's learning sees differences without seeing similarities, unable to eliminate relativity into the absolute. What is now to be abandoned is this kind of learning, because it only exhausts the mind and increases confusion; as for the study of the Tao, how can it be abandoned? What people fear lies in the differences, relativity and relationships, like 'Wei' and 'A', like 'good' and 'evil'. What people fear, but I should not fear, is like the meaning of "holding to the middle," adapting to the authority of others. But in reality, it is far from the Tao. "央" (Yang) means center; "未央" (Wei Yang) means not centering the Tao. In times of chaos and popular delusion, those who have attained the Tao conceal their traces within, wisely preserving themselves while awaiting change, until the moment when the tendency (the tendency of opposites becoming interconnected) arrives, then they assist its reversal, leading it back to the Tao, thereby achieving great peace and supreme order. Though the sage outwardly conceals himself to preserve himself, inwardly he clearly holds fast to the Tao. What he adheres to is always different from what the masses choose, hence the following text often contrasts "the masses..." with "I alone..." to show that the sage is ultimately different from the masses. "熙熙" (Xi Xi) should be interpreted as bustling and agitated. The enjoyment of a great sacrifice and ascending a spring terrace are what people rush to compete for—this is a metaphor for the masses busily and diligently pursuing the superficial learning of 'Wei A' and 'Good Evil,' far from centering on the "Tao." "泊" (Bo) means a boat mooring to the shore; "兆" (Zhao) means an image. "泊兮其未兆" (Bo Xi Qi Wei Zhao) is a metaphor for abiding by the Tao without attachment, dissolving traces and images into the wholeness of chaos, not revealing the sharpness and edges of using intellect in superficial learning—like an infant who has not yet smiled, whose likes and dislikes are just budding, and who neither accepts nor rejects anything, hence "as if without a home." "家人皆有餘" (Jia Ren Jie You Yu) means the masses "increase daily in learning"; "我獨若遺" (Wo Du Ruo Yi) means the sage abides by the Tao in the center, is unfamiliar with the superficial learning of the realm of form, and therefore "seems to have lost everything." However, the sage's abandonment of the learning of the realm of form is not a real loss. The sage's aim is in the Tao and not in the instrument; he constantly adheres to the "discipline of the Tao," at times holding on to the past to govern the present, and never fails to be enlightened, so he can "know without going out, name without seeing, and accomplish without doing." "愚人" (Yu Ren), the fool, is how the sage views the masses, always like fools. The sage's wisdom is inwardly contained, not pursuing things as intelligence, pure and without knowledge. From the view of the masses, their foolishness is beyond reach—this is why great wisdom seems like foolishness. "昭昭" (Zhao Zhao) and "察察" (Cha Cha) are the outward overflow of the masses' small wisdom; "昏昏" (Hun Hun) and "悶悶" (Men Men) are the inward containment of the sage's great wisdom. The masses use their intelligence on things, so they have the effects of "昭昭" and "察察" ; the sage uses his intelligence on the Tao, and the Tao has no image, so he is "昏昏" and "悶悶". But the sage's "昏昏" and "悶悶" are not like the "昏昏" and "悶悶" of the masses. The sage uses intelligence and transcends intelligence, only following the Tao, not being enslaved by things, so he can be "昏昏" and "悶悶". Only those who use intelligence and transcend intelligence can have the effect of "昏昏" and "悶悶"; when the world reaches the state of "昏昏" and "悶悶", then there will be a day of peace. Isn't the Westerners' intellectual civilization what is called "昭昭" and "察察"? Because they use intelligence but cannot transcend intelligence, they are enslaved by intelligence, leading to plunder and slaughter, and humanity suffers. "海" (Hai), the sea, is a symbol of completeness, a symbol of all-encompassing. The rise and fall of bubbles are just the surface of the sea. The rise and fall of bubbles do not affect the completeness of the sea. The sage's words and actions are the application of the Tao body. Words and actions are adapted to the times and adjusted to the circumstances, while adhering to the Tao without change, therefore "like the sea." Because it is all-encompassing, there are no biases or strong likes or dislikes, so it is detached. "颼兮" (Sou Xi) is like drifting. The sage abides by the Tao, and the Tao is emptiness. It responds to things without clinging to them, so it can use things without being used by them, therefore "no end"—"no end" means not being tied down. "衆人皆有以" (Zhong Ren Jie You Yi) picks up from the above "有餘" (You Yu), meaning that the masses take superficial learning as intelligence, and their intelligence cannot be suspended in emptiness, clinging to physical objects in the realm of form. Its effect is obvious and easily seen, and it seems as if there is something to grasp. "我獨頑且鄙" (Wo Du Wan Qie Bi) picks up from the above "昏昏悶悶" (Hun Hun Men Men). "昏昏悶悶", to the masses, truly seems stupid and base. "母" (Mu), the mother, is the Tao; the Tao is where all things come from. The Tao and things are like mother and child. "食母" (Shi Mu) means "guarding the mother," which is guarding the Tao. All people pursue things, I alone guard the Tao. This is why the sage is different from the masses.

### The Psychology of Rumors (3)

— Fang Zheng

The rumor in Washington occurred in the morning and spread throughout San Francisco in the afternoon. The reason is that everyone wants to be the first to tell the news to another person. You only need to look at a spreader of rumors. When he asks you, "Do you know this news?" ... When you answer that you don't know, you can see from his beaming and triumphant expression how satisfying and exciting it is to tell a piece of news or rumor that you don't know! Therefore, everyone who holds onto a rumor spreads it with great speed. The spread of rumors is like a competition. If you spread it one step slower, others will be one step ahead, and you will not have the chance to get that victory feeling of breaking the news. This competitive mood is like a wildfire blown by the wind, causing it to rapidly sweep across the vast plains.

Armies and densely populated cities are ideal areas for the spread of rumors, because of the density of contact. For a rumor to be effective, it must spread quickly. For a rumor to spread quickly, it must naturally be in a place where there is a lot of contact between people. Armies and cities are the most ideal. They are not only close in distance, but also have similar interests and many of the same benefits and harms. In this way, rumors spread very quickly from one person's mouth to another person's ear. If there are no common interests and harms, then "the speaker is earnest, but the listener is indifferent," and the rumor will not "sweep through like the wind." Sometimes, it is even just to find some conversation material—attractive material—that a person can easily fabricate some rumors to talk about. To make it sound attractive, he may have to be secretive and pretend to be very confidential. These "whispers" are often some of the most dangerous rumors—the most unfounded, but the most attractive.

Rumors have little power at one person's mouth. Because a person cannot believe official news, it is naturally difficult for him to easily believe the words from one person's mouth. But when a rumor is spread from one person to ten, and ten people to a hundred, and then the whole society is spreading this rumor, even if you are the most cautious person, you will be shaken by the rumor. In a situation of "surrounded by the songs of Chu on all sides," even a man of iron will surrender. No one can resist the overall suggestion. Believing in her son like Zeng's mother, but when she heard everyone in the city saying that her son had killed someone, she couldn't help but be moved. So some rumors, although they were clearly spread by oneself, and one clearly knows that their source is completely impossible, but after being spread again and again, until the whole society is saying so, he himself does not dare to disbelieve its authenticity. The power of the masses is so great! You may not believe it, but the fact is that rumors not only deceive those who listen to rumors, they often also confuse the rumor-monger himself.

### Anecdotes from the Academic World (19)

— Zhang Qiyun

Political Atmosphere

Liang Rengong's family letters contain words about the political atmosphere in the early years of the Republic of China, which are still worth reflecting on and deeply considering even after twenty or thirty years. He described the political situation in Beiping in the early Republic: "In the past two months, more than 70,000 people have been active in the Xiheyan area to seek positions. Everyone is vying for a piece of the pie. This is China's greatest affliction." He once said that China's ailment is that all the intelligent and talented people in the country flock to politics. Rengong was not against officials, but he believed that without changing the atmosphere, there would be no hope for a clean and bright government. To change the atmosphere and remedy the current evils, the main points are nothing more than the loyalty and sincerity advocated by Zeng Wenzheng.

Rengong believed that when discussing political parties, one should first emphasize the distinction between righteousness and profit. How can those who see profit and forget righteousness be called party members? "Once the two words 'power' and 'profit' are uttered, then contention and theft will emerge, either secretly or openly, and their origin will be elusive. Those who enter it must be cunning, treacherous, and ruthless to compete with each other. Now I know why Mencius did not speak of profit, which is profound and enlightening." He also argued that building a party requires strict discipline and closeness to the hearts of the people. His words are not in vain.

Rengong once held the view of "talent economy," saying that if a person wants to serve the country or society, he should make the most of his strengths. He also said that there is no such thing as a small or big matter in the world. As long as you do your best within your responsibilities, you are a first-class person. Rengong claimed that he always sought good assistants when handling affairs, and that a leader should be diligent in using people and leisurely in managing affairs. Regarding the importance of group action, he said, "I always inevitably take the blame for others, but because of this, I feel the pain of not having a group. There are indeed many capable people among my friends, with correct morals, knowledge, and principles, but without the unified action of a group, not only can they not exert their influence, but they often negate their influence due to inconsistency, which is truly painful." (Said at the age of 55) He also said that to accomplish things through people, one must humble oneself to accommodate others, which is a very insightful statement.

Rengong also said, "To accomplish great things today, one must not maintain the boundaries of the same school or different schools. To handle the great affairs of the world, one must gather all the heroes of the world." "One of the drawbacks of my own school is that I must only accept and employ those whose talents and abilities are subject to my control. This will inevitably not lead to heroes. Those who are easy to control must be less talented, so what benefit do I gain from them? Therefore, one must exhaust all methods to recruit those who are difficult to drive and difficult to control. However, to recruit them, one cannot rely on small tricks, but must rely on openness, generosity, sincerity, and impartiality." This statement can be said to be aimed at the root cause of China's political problems. Rengong once said, "I grow more fearful as I experience more." He also said, "In the past, as an onlooker, I criticized, thinking that the affairs of the world could be understood in one or two sentences, but now I truly dare not lightly blame others." These few words contain many hidden pains.

The foundation of politics lies in education, and not only in narrow school education, but also in broad social education. Rengong said in the late Qing Dynasty, "Western philosophers say that representatives are the image of the national psychology. The members of the modern consultative bureau have roughly sketched this image for us to see together." In the second year of the Republic of China, Rengong was so angry that he wanted to cut ties with politics. In the fifth year, he agreed with his comrades that when the military situation was slightly calmer, he would devote himself to social education, as Confucius said, "This is also governing." He believed that China's greatest affliction was the lack of flourishing scholarship and the decline of morality. Without making great efforts in social education, the national situation could hardly be saved. To seek fundamental political reform, one must start with the national psychology. To transform the national psychology, one must start with social education. The main tool of social education is public opinion, and the soul of public opinion is thought, so thought is the driving force for creating a new era. This consistent theory is truly an unchanging truth.

### A Dim Light

— Bai Yong

The invention of fire was a major event for mankind, so myths include the imprisoned Prometheus, whom Greek scholars turned into a lasting dramatic play. Although it is a fable, we can imagine that before primitive humans could use fire, many people must have sacrificed to it, for example, children with no knowledge got burned while playing with fire. As Lao Tzu said, "Arms are like fire; those who do not know how to handle them will burn themselves," which looks ordinary but contains some pain. In mythology, Zhurong氏 won the battle against Yu Wang (榆罔) with great fire, and even in the Ming Dynasty, Lu Xixing's story of the Investiture of the Gods still retained the story of the Fire Virtue True Lord Luo Yi. If it weren't for Princess Longji's purifying water bottle, Xiqi City would have almost been reduced to ashes. Therefore, whenever I went to the Fire God Temple as a child, I couldn't help but feel a sense of inexplicable terror towards the idol who had a redder face than a drunkard and an "electric eye" on his forehead.

Perhaps what I have seen is too biased towards the side that makes people nervous. Steam and electricity are both generated by fire. Without it, would mankind have modern happiness? That's right. The fire that burns people and destroys houses can give us tow trucks and machines to drive, changing the face of the entire world. Materialists place the center of historical progress on the use of tools, but why not put it on fire? Not only is the foundation of modern capitalist production—machines—powered by fire, but also the smelting of iron and copper in ancient times. Which one did not rely on fire? Primitive people used stone tools precisely because they did not yet know the age of fire. However, this great fire also caused a great disaster. The leap forward in society has turned the flame of production into the flames of war, and the suffering and happiness people have suffered are almost unbalanced. Radicals are even more unable to endure this, and this spark that has not been extinguished often one day will turn into a blazing flame and evolve into a prairie fire.

Presumably, Prometheus stealing fire for mankind meant that the immortals in the heavens were enjoying the light and happiness of fire—it is nonsense to say that gods do not eat cooked food. If there really are gods, and the gods are righteous and intelligent, they must first know how to burn things with fire—while mankind was still in the stage of ignorance, eating blood and sleeping on skins, so they had such a bold and generous gift. However, causing the fire to spread was not Prometheus's original intention. Here, of course, one must hate those in charge of the fire, why they could not guide it to work and cook for most people, but instead created opportunities, even piling wood on the fire. The lessons of the past have been overturned, but the mistakes are not corrected. The foolishness of mankind can indeed be admired.

Burning, fire, and disasters are unfortunate no matter what. However, darkness is really hard to endure. This makes me think of the "light of a dim fire" that the ancients often spoke of, which is not a little light. Electric lights are indeed very bright, but for someone who has just emerged from the darkness, it is too blinding. Perhaps a bean oil lamp or a candle would be more likely to make people see things clearly. Gradually expand the light again. We should always know about the pupil dilation and contraction that physiology talks about. Generally, this line of light can indeed lead most people to walk, or as our legend says, Che Wuzi reading by collecting fireflies, perhaps he would not let the wildfire run wild. Then, the merit would not be small.

The so-called light is precisely accumulated from dim flames. The ancients said it well, the beginning of the river flow is just a trickle. Mencius used this reason to advocate that people should develop the beginnings of goodness. For example, "the beginning of a fire burning, the beginning of a spring reaching," the beginning of a fire burning is probably all a faint light, not like a match, starting with a bang. Everything in the world that is not made up of small things often cannot withstand temptation and tempering. Isn't the Xinhai Revolution a golden lesson? The ancients also said, "A gust of wind does not last all morning, and a heavy rain does not last all day." On the one hand, extreme prosperity is difficult to sustain, and on the other hand, people are a little tired of this kind of thing, so they say these somewhat resentful words. We should treat it as human nature and not stubbornly stick to physics. Some people express complete aversion to the Chinese traditional doctrine of the mean. It is true that the mean may sometimes become a shield of stubbornness, but for the way of life, it is a consistent requirement of mankind. The frigid zone and the tropical zone are not suitable for settlement. Only the temperate zone is the center of culture. In ancient times, the barbarians who lived in the subarctic zone always wanted to migrate south. The Xiongnu and Xianbei in China and the Normans in the West are all examples of this. This clearly shows that there is a natural tendency towards the mean in physiology. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all aimed at comfort to the extreme, and although airplanes and trains are developing speed as much as possible, there is also a limit. If it is exceeded, it is not something that physiology can support, even if there is artificial oxygen to breathe. The Chinese cannot say that they do not understand these things in life. They also talk about it completely in philosophy. One tight, one loose, one rigid, one soft, are all good, the difference is that words and actions do not correspond. What ordinary people and the majority of the people want is not a burning wildfire or coldness, but a uniform and suitable temperature. Unfortunately, although there is a lot of cultural accumulation and a large population, this long-term malaria with irregular cold and heat is enough to destroy it. Thinking of this, I cannot help but sigh three times and feel that I want to jump out of the fire pit but have no way to do it.

### Liang Hongzhi's Fate and Physiognomy

— Chen Yixian

In Mr. Yun's article "The Art of Judging People" in Free Talk, it is mentioned that one can see a person's "lifespan," "poverty and success," "loyalty and treachery," and "good and evil" from their physiognomy. Today, the art of fate and physiognomy is regarded as superstition by most people, but I am afraid that the number of people who have consulted fortune-tellers and physiognomists still accounts for the majority, right? I have always just played along with others when it comes to fortune-telling and physiognomy, and I don't believe it, but Liang Hongzhi's fate and physiognomy do have some surprising aspects. I will now describe them one by one.

In the 27th year of the Republic of China, Liang organized the "Renovation Government" under the orders of the Japanese. Before the meeting, his whereabouts were secretive. Some people said that he lived in the Weida Hotel. One day, I met my friend Shi Wenfu on Avenue Joffre. Shi was good at judging people's physiognomy. The two of us went into a coffee shop to chat. Shi talked about how he had recently judged Liang's physiognomy. If he came out this time, the result would probably not be good. I asked him why. Shi said: "Liang's eyes droop at the corners, and his shape is like a pig. When a pig is fattened, doesn't it always have to be slaughtered?" This is the first oddity.

Liang and Huang Rong both had reputations as poets, and people called them Huang Liang. Liang studied at the university, and Huang graduated from the Translation College. He was one class behind me. I knew Liang because of Huang. In the early years of the Republic of China, there was a person named Ru Ziwen in the old capital, from Penglai County, Shandong Province, who lived in a hotel in Xiheyan and was very famous for fortune-telling. One day, I went with Guo Zize and Liang to have our fortunes told. Each of us reported our birthdates. Ru used an abacus to calculate and said: "Liang's fate is the best, but after the age of sixty, he must retire to seclusion to preserve himself." Liang was working on a small matter at the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau at the time. Hearing this, he was quite pleased with himself. A few days later, I ate roast duck with Huang Lansheng at Tongfulou. After that, we went to Ru's place together and asked how good Liang's fate would be in the future and how bad it would be in the end. Ru said: "According to my Bagua calculations, Le will be able to reach the position of Prime Minister of the State in the future, but after the age of sixty, if he does not listen to my words and withdraw quickly, I am afraid that he will be killed." This is the second oddity.

When Japan surrendered, Chen Qun was the only one in the Nanjing Wang government who committed suicide. Before committing suicide, Chen left a short note, saying: "When the founding of the country was announced, I was told that if it failed, I would die for it. I am going now. Please take care of yourself." Liang hesitated and could not make up his mind, and was eventually executed by firing squad. Liang's poetry and prose were amazingly talented and truly a talent of his generation. One wrong thought caused people to lament the beautiful woman's misfortune. Alas!

### Xu Wenchang on Ghostwriting

Ghostwriting for others has become a custom in modern times. It seems that this was rare in ancient times. I recently read Xu Wenchang's small preface to the Collection of Drafts, and his discussion of writing for others is very interesting. I am copying it below:

"In ancient times, there were few people who wrote articles for others, because those who could write were either eminent or impoverished: the eminent were noble, and it was impossible to ask them to ghostwrite; the impoverished were of high moral character, and there was no way to obtain them, so how could they ghostwrite? Wei Yuwen was unfortunately like a horse for plowing, situated between the non-eminent and the non-hidden, so people could ghostwrite for him, and Wei could not forbid it. Moreover, the current system uses timely meanings, and those who obtain official positions through the old profession do not write ancient prose, or even if they do, the gifts they send are a hundred times greater than in ancient times, so they have no choice but to resort to ghostwriting, and those who ghostwrite must be scholars of low status, not recluses. Therefore, one can observe people and examine the world through ghostwriting."

From this, we can see that those who are ghostwritten for are sad, and the social atmosphere is also sad. I wonder what the famous people of today think of this? (Hongxian)

### Dueling in Italy

— Chen Xiang

Dueling is very popular in post-war Italy, but it is also very safe. It can be said that no one has died unjustly in a duel.

The weapons are pistols and swords, which can be chosen at will. Most duels are fought with pistols, because in the memory of Italians, no duelist has ever been hit by a bullet, although a few assistants have suffered collateral damage and had their pants burned by gunpowder. The ideal component of the gunpowder in the bullets fired by both sides is to shoot out with a gentle "psst" sound, so that the bullet falls to the ground as soon as it leaves the muzzle and rolls forward gently along the ground. A few days before the duel, the weapons are first tested in the dueling arena. The distance between the two ends is thirty or forty yards—even a skilled shooter would find the target too small at this distance. Two paper mannequins are placed at each end of the arena, and then they are shot with guns. If the bullet hits the paper target, it is not qualified; if it passes through the paper, the amount of gunpowder should be drastically reduced. In short, the most ideal amount of gunpowder must be tested before real people can be used as targets.

Another type of duel is with swords. After the expensive preliminary work of booking a sword, hiring an instructor, and selecting a venue is completed, the formal duel begins. The duelists take off their shirts, hold their swords, and stand far apart. The instructor and referee is the real hero in the duel. He takes the sword and stands between the two sides, watching them not to fight too close. As soon as the two sides' swords touch, he calls out: "Stop!" Then he separates them with his own sword. After that, every time the two people get within striking distance, he does so. If one side really wants to end the other side's life—but this is rare—he hurriedly uses his sword to block it.

In the end, the two people inevitably fall down exhausted, or the instructor is stabbed, or one or both sides suffer minor injuries to their arms, or both sides simply stop out of exhaustion, and then everyone kisses each other, and a duel full of dark clouds disappears—they each go home and brag about it.

### Right and Wrong

— Shao Yun

The torrent of material and utilitarian interests is overflowing, and the changes of attack, slander, and deceit are intricate, which has made society as dark as a pile of old paint, and made the world as chaotic as tangled hemp, which is difficult to sort out. Therefore, the various ethical standards of right and wrong, good and evil seem to have shaken their foundations.

I remember there was such a joke: two people, A and B, ate a side dish of bamboo shoots mixed with pork. Another gentleman saw it, and because A was good to him and B had a gap with him, he made his "monthly criticism": Mr. A is really thrifty, he even mixes some bamboo shoots in the pork; Mr. B is really extravagant, he even puts pork in the bamboo shoots.

This is probably what is called "right and wrong" today, right?

### The Habit of Writing Articles

— Jinjin

When writing articles, everyone has their own habits. Some like a bright and clean window, calmly wielding the pen, writing each character meticulously, so that the manuscript becomes a wonderful calligraphy model. Others, amidst the deafening noise of mahjong and conversations, go their own way, focusing on the eternal cause of writing with a pen in hand.

More than ten years ago, I translated an article about writers from the Atlantic Monthly for a weekly magazine, which mentioned the different habits of Western writers when writing. Some like to drink coffee, some like to have a black person scratch their scalp, and some even need to arrange a banana scent in the room, so that their thoughts flow when they smell it, which is close to a quirk.

As for me, I also have some special habits. I often like to start writing two or three articles at the same time. When I run out of inspiration for one article, I put it aside and choose another topic to write. After writing a considerable number of words, I suddenly have an epiphany and continue with the first article. I write in segments in two or three articles in this way. Sometimes, I can finish the article after writing one or two more sections, sometimes I have to write it in five or six times, and sometimes I don't even write it anymore.

Secondly, some people like to publish articles in different newspapers and magazines at the same time, that is, the so-called "prolific writer." But I like to write articles one by one and publish them in order, and I don't want to send them all out at once.

In the cartoonist's pen, the writer's study is often messy, with books, newspapers, and pictures piled up everywhere, and paper, ink, brushes, and inkstones are randomly placed. This seems to reflect the author's general lack of knowledge of tidying up and aesthetic concepts, only knowing how to write. Perhaps eight or nine out of ten writers have this habit. If gold-lettered, leather-bound masterpieces are neatly placed on the bookshelf, and fancy fountain pens are inserted into the marble pen holder, it may be difficult to write a single word.

Finally, I think that the writing tool - fountain pen or brush - has its own advantages. If you use a fountain pen, the writing is smooth, and you can record fleeting thoughts like a race. If you use a brush, you can have room for ideas while dipping the brush and grinding the ink. In short, in my humble opinion, it is better to use a fountain pen when writing factual articles, and a brush is better for writing profound theoretical texts, so that the ink on the pen tip will not stagnate by the time you think of the next sentence.

### Small Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Teach children how to speak; when children grow into youth, teach them how to speak again; it is not easy to learn this lesson—speaking. Suddenly, they are old. People again want him to be silent, hoping he better not speak.

The best actor on stage plays different roles in different plays, perhaps rarely—or even never—playing himself.

On the stage of life: you may be your father's good son, your wife's good husband, your children's good father, your compatriots' good brother, your servants' good master, your colleagues' good boss, your mother-in-law's good son-in-law... Have you ever thought about: are you your own best self?

If grapes weren't sour and lemons weren't sweet, there might be more strife in the world.

The dolls in the shop window are all beautiful, but the most beautiful is the one that is bought by someone.

### Chicken and Cat

— Gao Junbin

"The mountain house is good, full of life and growing, chickens protect their chicks and compete to protect their mother, cats give birth to one kitten, just like their mother, creatures are also kind."

The above is a quatrain of Wangjiangnan, written by my father (Editor's note: The author of this article is Mr. Gao Chuiwan's son.) a few years ago, longing for his hometown and reminiscing about old dreams. The entire draft has sixty-four sections, describing the scenery of the mountain house such as wind, flowers, snow, moon, moving plants, flying and diving creatures, vividly. Mr. Yao Yuqin read it and named his domestic cat "Wanyu" after it. When Mr. Feng Zikai read it, he took the meaning of the above quatrain and drew a picture to present it. Last year was my father's seventieth birthday. He firmly declined the celebration, only celebrating Dongpo's birthday and holding an elegant winter gathering. He then made this painting into poetry stationery and distributed it to relatives and friends. My father named the stationery "Chicken and Cat Stationery," and those who received it praised it as wonderful. (Mr. Feng's painting is shown in the picture)

### Writing in Prison

— Leng Leng

An American state prison committee once expressed its opinion on writing by inmates in prison, saying:

"Almost every inmate in prison is willing to engage in writing for life, so prison schools allow inmates to have the freedom to write. Although few are truly successful, many famous writers have completed masterpieces in prison, which is undeniable."

Looking back at history, there are many examples to prove it: like the most famous playboy in history, the so-called Walter Raleigh who wore jewels on his shoes and pearls in his ears - the suave flatterer who once laid a new coat on the ground for Queen Elizabeth of England to step on, also wrote in prison. For political reasons, he spent fourteen years in prison. - In his simple, dirty and narrow prison cell, he stared at the walls covered with endless mud. His hands and feet eventually became stiff due to severe rheumatism, but he endured all the pain and completed many beautiful poems in prison, which are still selected as teaching materials by many universities and specialized schools! (Editor's note: Raleigh was later beheaded.)

The writer who sold more than six million copies - O. Henry, the master of American short stories, was once unjustly arrested and imprisoned, and sentenced to five years in prison; although being imprisoned is a shame, for O. Henry, if he had not been a prisoner, how could he have been able to write with peace of mind, so that his name would be immortal!

John Bunyan was arrested and imprisoned for preaching, and served twelve years in prison. At first, in order to take care of the lives of his wife and four poor children outside the prison, he had to busy himself making lace with his ten fingers in order to exchange money to supplement his family. But later, the great thoughts and inspirations in his mind suddenly began to surge, making him unable to bear it any longer, and he had to write in the cold, damp, and dark dungeon. Who knew that he would complete an amazing masterpiece, which is "The Pilgrim's Progress." Now there are translations in all countries of the world. Except for the Bible, it is the first book in the world to be sold most widely.

Cervantes' immortal work, Don Quixote, was also written in prison. In addition, Voltaire, Oscar Wilde, and Anthony Burgess all had writings in prison; even Hitler's autobiography, "Mein Kampf," which has sold two million copies, was also half-written by Hitler in prison.

Two hundred and sixty years ago, Richard Lovelace was also arrested and imprisoned in an English prison, which resulted in him writing an immortal poem in prison, and even the prison became famous for it. This is a love poem sent to his lover, and its title is "To Althea, from Prison." The poem says: Stone walls do not a prison make, Nor iron bars a cage; Minds innocent and quiet take That for an hermitage; If I have freedom in my love, And in my soul am free, Angels alone, that soar above, Enjoy such liberty.
